B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3OWMX70M5NXVQ	"Aaron F. ""aaronfissel"""	I went to see this movie four times, during its theater run and everytime I was satisfied with what was shown before me. The cast is great, the special effects are the best of any movie I've seen, and it has a great story.This reincarnation of the 1933 classic is truelly spectacular in many ways. Naomi Watts is the perfect choice for the Ann Darrow character, and Jack Black makes a acceptable Carl Denham. Adrien Brody character I don't care for at all. The true characters of the film are the fifty foot tall gigantic gorilla Kong and Miss Ann Darrow.I always cheer for the powerful King Kong. From his violent battle with the three V-Rex, to his final tragic battle atop the Empire State Building, to his final moments with Ann atop the gigantic building. I love the character of King Kong and I always will.This film pays great tribute to the 1933 classic and gives a great, and entertaining show! I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a truelly great film with tons of action, drama, and a giant gorilla. The best film of 2005! No question about it! Kong is King!!!Buy this movie and enjoy it!! It's worth the price and the entertainment!!! :)	5.0	King Kong: The Eighth Wonder of the World!!	2008-07-02	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A24NN1DJGINMRG	Aaron	I won't give a plot synopsis, this is a review of the product. The extra footage and footage quality of this Blu Ray is amazing! It is an instant classic that was done right by Peter, Jack, and Adrian and company. I could talk about this movie all day, what with the breakthrough CGI that really wasn't approached up to this level beforehand... but suffice it to say the Blu Ray does it justice, and the sound is amazing in my home theater.	4.0	I bought this solely for the extra footage and picture quality, since I already own it!	2013-07-24	1	1	0

The best part of the movie was when the usher had to kick out some unruly teens.  To think about it they were the smart ones.  They paid $9 to see only half of a crappy movie, I had to pay $9 to sit through a 3 hour snoozer.  The whole s@#& on the island did not need to be in the movie.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A35R8PJSEURHHF	Aaron Merkel	They should have just made this a miniseries and then they would have been able to have more side stories and characters that they seemed to want.  BUT, they put it all in one movie.  Overall, good movie, there are some tense moments (dinosaur chase, bug attack)..and it all reminded me of Jurrassic Park.  King Kong was animated really well, but everything else was kind of wierd looking and you could tell it was green screen behind them (but I guess that's what they were looking for).  You may find yourself forwarding most scenes just to get through this without going crazy.  Recommend - - but forward through slow parts.	4.0	Kong, the Miniseries	2006-04-03	7	2	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2ETWA2I83MZGE	"ABI ALY ""DAVE"""	Some movies have implausible plots that can often be overlooked,but when they get too far-fetched,they spoil the whole movie.KING KONG has these which reduce the overall continuity of the film.In comparison with the classic 1933 version,this remake undoubtedly excels in almost every aspect of movie making.Yet it has some distinct plot holes :1. The tribal native vaulting from pole to pole over a series  of broken headlands in  bad weather at night,kidnapping the lead actress from the ship and carrying her back to the land.Seeing that the poles are stuck to the sea bed,it is hard to believe that a pole can be THAT long.All the more implausible is the way the native returns from the ship,with the victim, to the land.The 1933 version has the natives use a boat and jump onto the ship to kidnap the lead actress. This is plausible.2.  The surviving expedition crew hauling the drugged Kong up  onto the ship.With only few survivors left alive and without any possible aid from the hostile natives,how do they do that ?In the 1933 version,Kong is said to be brought to the ship on a makeshift raft and besides,there are also the natives who might have given help.Quite convincing.3.  Kong being chained and exhibited in the concert hall.The building must have been built before Kong is brought  back to New York.So,how do the people get Kong inside it ? How HUGE can the hall entrance be considering the location of the hall in the city center ?There is not any depiction of any rear or special entrance from where Kong is brought in. The 1933 version has it. Clever.Were this the 1933 version,I would compromise.But being a 2005 remake,these should have been made more convincing.That said,the 2005 version has proven that not all remakes are  worse than the original.KING KONG will become a FUTURE classic just as the 1933 version has.	4.0	One enjoyably entertaining remake with some plot holes	2006-07-05	8	6	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	A. Burchfield	I didn't really mind the length and thought the plot was pretty well laid out, the casting good too. The movie at just over three hours may have hurt it in this short attention span world but what is there to cut?I don't know if I've ever seen the original so I can't really compare the two but Jackson's Kong was well written, the sets were great (apparently none of the story really filmed in New York)and most of the computer generated effects were top quality (I did think some of the dinosaurs didn't look quite right). I liked the characterization of Kong as an old, beat up, Gorilla.I just have a few complaints;#1 What happened to the natives?, you never see them after they offer Ann up to Kong. All the time the story spends on the island and you learn nothing much about them.#2 The 'native' part of the island looks almost as fake, sometimes, as I remember the sets looking in the original, most of the story apears to have been shot somewhere real.#3 Between Kong's capture (even if the ship's crew made their living capturing wild animals why'd they have so many gallons of chloroform- more than enough for Kong even)and the show in New York, where's the story? Not even a line about it except for a bit about Ann not working for Jack Black's character.#4 Kong's weight and emotions. A 25ft. Gorilla would surely weigh in at 25 tons yet Kong would climb/sit on things as if he weighed a real world gorilla weight. Do real Gorilla's laugh or smile? I didn't mind it but I'm not sure that they do.This movie is worth seeing and owning, I'll be getting a copy the next time I order DVD's I think.	4.0	Long but better than many that last half as long	2006-05-21	6	2	4

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A22AD8M2SSOFHJ	"A. C. Ege/Acedoh ""acedoh"""	Watching this movie in high definition was a treat.  The picture is amazingly clear and the sound is impressive.  For movie viewing it will be hard to watch anything with less of a picture now.My problem comes with the movie.  King Kong is far from an enjoyable movie to me.  When I watch an action movie I want action.  This movie was so diluted with anemic acting and a rather boring story line.  I waited over an hour to see some action and even after that it was limited.  This movie is over three hours long and is a good sleepy time tale but when it comes to action I will view something else.	3.0	Impressive picture but lacking action...	2006-11-14	10	1	9
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3PCC8VFK0ML7L	achtung	I was one of the first to see this movie in my area, having attended the 11:45 (a.k.a. first) showing of it at my local Carmike cinema. All I can say is, I went expected action, great special effects, as well as an interesting story, and I got it all tenfold.The sheer scale of this flick is enough to impress even the most dessensitized eyes. You go from the concrete jungle of a city that seems to be mostly computer generated, to being immersed in the bowels of a lost (true) jungle where most of the film takes place, then of course, back into the city again. The cast is excellent, with the severely attractive Naomi Watts leading the pack as Ann Darrow. Adrien Brody also stars as Jack Driscoll, and having absolutely no familiarity with him as an actor, I was quite impressed and surprised that I hadn't seen him elsewhere. Jack Black was a perfect choice for Carl Denham, who is meant to be lovable while also being responsible for much of the bad stuff that happens in the film. The rest of the cast is great as well, and I can't think of a single role that was obviously miscast.I was very glad I went to see this movie when I did, with a group of moviegoers whose fresh eyes were just as impressed as mine.Also, I thought the Christmas trees in the movie were a nice touch, with it being so close to the holidays. By most standards, this is a movie meant for the Summer season.	5.0	Fabulous movie.	2005-12-16	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2EEUQ81DTY7G3	A Customer	I was never a huge fan of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but I could certainly admire his tremendous achievement at bringing the trilogy to life. You certainly have to hand it to him, he's one of the most visionary directors working today and the fact that he can combine state of the art jaw dropping special effects with stories that are also deeply human and so often heartfelt, says a lot about his enormous talent.Told in three parts, the story the story begins in New York where Ann Darrow (a ravishing Naomi Watts) works in vaudeville in Manhattan. When her theater closes, a desperate Ann runs into Carl Denham (Jack Black), a shady movie producer who's looking to make an adventure film on an island no one's sure even exists. Once Ann signs on, she meets playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), who has been tricked into sailing with Denham so he can finish the movie's script.Once the group is shipwrecked on the island, the movie ramps it up, with the first appearance of the big hairy ape making a classically enormous entrance. Keep in mind that it takes almost 70 minutes for the three-hour movie to provide our first view of Kong. But once we meet him, the stage is set for a battle involving the scary human residents of the island and some of the most amazing looking prehistoric creatures that you will ever see on screen.In fact, the Island sequence could be enough for one movie, as the unrestrained Jackson has Kong, Ann, and the shipwrecked humans going up against all kinds of scary creatures, including stampeding packs of bloodthirsty dinosaurs and hordes of monster insects with super-viscous insides. This is a nerve giggling, audacious spectacular movie that ultimately will go down as one of the years best.Of course, Ann eventually realizes she can handle Kong, and she charming and entertaining the beast with her vaudeville. Kong falls in love with her becoming her protector, while Ann holds a deep gratitude to him for saving her life.  And it just adds to the movie's poignancy because we know that she's the only being to whom Kong seems connected.Insatiability trumps trustworthiness and kindliness, and Denham eventually captures Kong anesthetizing him and putting him on display in New York, as a carnival spectacle. The movie culminates atop the Empire State Building - in a series of startling effects sequences  - where Jackson creates an emotional whirlwind around Ann and Kong.The acting is generally top notch with Watts turning in an especially nuanced and earthy performance as Ann. She could have camped it up, but to her credit, she plays it straight. The rest of the cast is also impressive, perfectly cast in their respective roles. Kyle Chandler does a lovely supporting turn as Bruce Baxter the preening actor who plays the first mate and Ann's love interest in Denham's movie and supplies the silly, B-movie dialogue for the film within the film; and Adrien Brody is also good as the offbeat, ruminative and ineffectual playwright who falls in love with Ann and sees through Denham but lacks the ability to stop him.Yes, the film is bloated and overstuffed and the middle section of the film is a little too long, but Kong's climactic scenes in New York are acted with such clarity and precision against a backdrop of such breathtaking sweep and detail of Jackson's re-created 1933 Manhattan, that it's excesses almost assume an operatic grandeur. Despite its shortcomings, Jackson's Kong is - especially in its last two-thirds - a thing of raging beauty, a gorgeous hairy beast that packs the unadulterated emotional whack of a tearjerker.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3JXPMX8E59PL1	Adam B. Krenn	"Peter Jackson has gone from talented visionary to presumptuous director with this pile of gorilla dung.  The only thing good about this movie was the acting.  This movie was overblown, over the top and reached new depths of eye rolling.  I never thought that action could be so boring.  I (a wanna be artist) never would have guessed that I (also a fan of directorial artistic freedom) could make the following statement...  A producer that could have reined Jackson in a bit would have only benefitted this picture.  This film was an extension of the problems that surfaced in the vastly superior Lord of the Rings (few, but they were there and more prevalent as the trilogy went on).  This film was also a victim of the LotR success. It never seemed to finds it's rhythm with me and never could figure out what it wanted to be.  I also think it's incredibly pretentious to hear so many people praise the great character development in this film, as if time was all that is needed to ""properly"" develop characters.  Sorry, there are many movies that do as well of a job at character development in much less time.  Another reviewer wrote that this film was not as good as the sum of it's parts.  Aptly put because the film is filled with fantastic scenes, unfortunately it's filled with just as many over the top scenes.  This movie did not live up to expectations at the Box Office, 51st overall currently at IMDB in total US with approx. $218mil, while seemingly respectable were not good considering the $200mil this movie cost to make.  Obviously not everyone could have enjoyed it.  Or is it that they simply didn't bother?  For my money, I'm still sticking with the original, it's still the archetype of action/adventure movies as cinematic art.  Jackson's version was just too much to stomach and I think it was a presumptuous imitation of the original by an otherwise talented director."	1.0	I can't be the only one that feels this way?	2006-05-12	22	9	13
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3INFSBNF8FYCU	Adam C. Campbell	Yeah, it's too long (Jackson seems to have been overly concerned with making each of his movie's three acts equal in length, resulting in anemic narrative, dangling subplots, and an excess of characters).Yeah, it takes a streamlined masterpiece (the 1933 original) and turns it into a bloated vanity piece completely lacking in restraint.But you know what?

Soon we were all on an unanticipatable journey into a re-newed unknown. Before the film rolled I expected ""decent"". One hour into the film I found myself ""enthralled"". When I left last night, I had a cheezy grin on my face as if I had just gotten away with something. Now, I am pumped. The more I think about it, the more it blows me away.I have had the opportunity to create a few documentaries ranging from Katrina to Israel. If you were to take just the Highlights of Kong and fit it into an hour long documentary, it would be very difficult, you would be cutting something. Its that good.The Scenery is constantly changing and the creatures vary from scene to scene. Thankfully they allow us to meet the characters and hold back Kong until the first hour. That is a lesson for all filmakers, if you show the monster quickly you've blown your load. Take Jaws or Shining for good examples. The tension builds until the final second, then the fx extravaganza begins. Kong is a beautiful creation.Hats off to WEDA for the incredible amounts of detail and precision. Also, for creating a film where it becomes very difficult to decifer between REAL, CG, Miniatures and Bigatures. It blends seamlessly. KING KONG is why we go to the movies. It is the new standard, which makes Titanic look like a kindergarden project.The casting is phenomenal. Jack Black's serious turn as an ""Orson Wells-like"" film director shows a new side to his tallent. It is awesome to see Collin Hanks making his way in the world as he plays the directors assistant. (Black and Hanks also worked together in ""Orange County"". Check that film out so see these guy's range.) Naomi Watts is the go-to actress for struggling actresses. As in Mulholland Drive she is a lady in need of a part. The role she finds is much bigger than she anticipates, and does a wonderful job doing it. Adrian Brody (as in The Pianist) is powerful in his subtle ways. ""Less is More"" is a brilliant motto for him to live by. The many remaining supporting actors and crew should also be applauded.Finally, what can be said about the multi-tallented, Andy Serkis? Not only does he play the embodiment of Kong for the animators, he also gives a go as a cook who's soup doubles for shaving cream. Serkis has captured our hearts before as the very torn Smeagal/Gollem. It seems we will see him return again soon... Production on the HOBBIT begins next winter. (That's official).King Kong is like a double-shot of epic with a lot of heart.

This newer interpretation is one of the best. The main plot evolves and twists, but the subplots are hilarious. I have not laughed so much in a non-comedic movie as I did with this one. The imagination that went into Skull Island is pure psychedelic genius. The creatures, the and fight and escape scenes, the whole inter-relationship between Kong and his environment, and the subtle human frailities uncovered by the greed and avarice of the protagaonists and antagonists: all of these were so well done.

So let's cut to the chase.  Why doesn't this film work?  OK -1.  Ann Darrow is pummeled and flung around by Kong and assorted prehistoric beasts for what seems like hours, any 5 seconds of which would have popped her head off like a toy, yet emerges unscathed.

Use of slow shutter speed when being terrorized by the natives for ""dramatic effect"" might work in an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries,"" but we could expect more from a multi-gajillion dollar Hollywood blockbuster.3.  Adrian Brody grabs Ann and flies a pterodactyl from a mountain ledge down to the jungle floor.  `Nuff said.4.  Jack Black demonstrates the acting range that has made him a leading contender for the role of ""Nacho Libre 2.""5.  Streets of New York, including Police cars, screaming pedestrians and assorted carnage and destruction, are nonsensically calmed and cleared during Kong's rampage through New York City to make way for a slo-motion Armani evening gown catwalk sequence.6.  The producers of King Kong were apparently forced to sign the ""every actor in every action movie must run across a series of bridges or groundwork which collapse into the abyss 0.003 seconds after they step off"" clause.7.  Brontosaurus stampede is ridiculous, CGI is unconvincing, and every actor in the movie should have been crushed dead within 12 seconds but isn't.  Sequence also seems to last for 45+ minutes8.  After finally capturing Kong, the now-damaged and too small vessel is tasked with carrying him.  Then we inexplicably cut to New York City where Kong has safely arrived.  ??????9.  Standing atop the Empire State Building in high heels poses no threat of falling due to winds, vertigo, or exhaustion10.  Nights in New York last from 10 PM to 11:45 PM, at which point the sun rises again.  I had no idea New York City occupied the same latitude as Nome, Alaska11.  Does Kong get relentlessly attacked every night by hordes of pterodactyls?  If so, why?  And if not, why now?12.  Are we supposed to believe that with much of the crew missing and maybe being killed, with the ship barely seaworthy and in desperate need of attention, the other crewmates have nothing better to do than discuss classic literature?13.  For that matter, why are many of these shipmates introduced, fleshed out, and never mentioned again?14.  How come no one in a staff of thousands working on the movie noticed any of the above?"	1.0	King Kong Goes Wrong	2007-02-23	24	10	14
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AAYW1H4SMNOI	"AFP ""AFP"""	I can't begin to explain how much it iritates me to see people bash this movie, or say it's a bad film. These are probably the same type of people that watched it and laughed throughout the most dramatic parts. Yea, analyze it, the camera, the script, every technical aspect, way to ruin it for yourself! Enough with all the ignorant reviews, to the movie. Take it for what it is, go into it with an open mind, and think about the feelings behind the faces. This is one of the most emotional films I've seen all year, and it doesn't need to come off looking sophisticated or intelligent for it to be just that, so film snobs and critics can close their mouths. It's much better than the original, you really feel for King Kong. It makes you realise how shallow humans really are. You can even view the movie metaphorically. There are  many King Kong's in this world right now, unloved, hurt, and just looking for someone to spend their life with, but because of their frame, they will never get what they truely want. I thought Jack Black would ruin the movie, but he played his part well, and at times you really wished that he died. This movie is very long, and the score is incredible. The special effects are INCREDIBLE! There's enough action in this movie to keep anyone satisfied, and those who said it was a boring film can go back to sticking their nose in the trendy novel they bought trying to fit in with what they think is different. If you get teary easily, keep a some tissue nearby. Movie of the year, for sure.	5.0	5 stars NOTHING LESS!	2005-12-23	10	4	6

The development of Kong's arrival at least an hour and a half into the movie was excellent, the tribal scenes were well done, the wrecking of the ship, and much much more. I saw this movie as a kid in the 70's, and now we have a very much updated version for our kids. So for the movie, I give it 5 stars *****Now, onto the HDDVD, content. I thoroughly enjoyed the richness of the non-HD version, then when I saw it in HD, I was in awe, the graphics are even richer, my kids point out they can see flashes of light in places that were not there in the regular DVD, that Kong looks so much better, the landscape and overall beauty of this film shows its true colors in HD. So for the HDDVD I have no choice but to give it 5 stars as well *****To the nay-sayers out there, please do check your setup, my HDDVD player is an XBOX based player, the XBOX then connects via. a composite RGB cable to an Onkyo A/V receiver(TX-SR674), the receiver then connects via. and HDMI cable to a Sony WEGA Rear Projection 1080i television.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A36311XF4O81IK	A. J. Trivette	"I won't rehash what most of the previous reviewers have said about this film, except to say some of them were right on target, and some of them totally missed the point. Remember, a ""review"" is, in the end, just one person's opinion. How can you review ANY film and expect everyone else to agree with that opinion? Answer....you simply can NOT! You can not decree that your likes or dislikes must be written in stone to which all others must adhere. That said, I'll share my reactions:One reviewer wondered why Kong would favor Ann over the countless other ""sacrifices"" he'd been offered through the years? DUH!!! Think about it! All he'd had were ""native"" girls, year after year. Then one day, his ""bride"" turns up having blonde hair and blue eyes! And, eyes that actually looked BACK at him. Don't you think the other damsels were either drugged into oblivion, or, at least, prepared for the honor of being Kong's bride from generations of such tradition. Now, here comes some sober blue eyes with some fight to her. Kong is fascinated by this new ""toy"", and instead of ripping her head off like some spoiled child with a toy he's tired of, is delighted with a new favorite. Political correctness aside, Ann become Kong's pet. And, as our pets become a part of our family, so too does Ann become Kong's family. And, he will protect her to his death. I really can't believe that reviewer didn't get this. At any rate......I do agree the film is too long, but, it is still totally entertaining. I think too much time was spent in the jungle with too many showcases for too many creatures. Yes, the brontosaurus stampede was thrilling, but...was it crucial to the story? Yes, the insect pit, even deleted from the original Kong, was gripping, but...was it crucial to the story? Perhaps the only ""creature feature"" that WAS crucial to the story (as it is seen), would be the T-Rex sequence. And, this because Kong is protecting Ann from them, establishing even further how Kong would endanger himself to protect Ann from harm.I won't counter other points made in previous reviews, but I do have to concur with the majority of them in that the special effects are seamless, and absolutely wondrous. Jackson has made 30's New York City into a time-warp wonder! Exquisite work! As is Skull Island, both in front of, and behind, the wall. But, the true wonder of the entire film is Kong. The marriage of Andy Serkis' live action work, with CGI actually makes Kong a living creature, complete with expressions and personality. And, with Kong being such a real character, the interaction between him and Ann becomes as real as it would between any two ""live"" actors. Now, where Jackson's Kong soars way and beyond the original is here - there IS a relationship between them. In the original, Fay Wray spent the entire film trying to get away from Kong.....even in the final act. There was no ""love"" lost for her. In Jackson's version, Ann comes to really love Kong as he loves her. I am touched just thinking about Ann reaching out to caress Kong. What must Kong be thinking? Had any one or any thing ever literally touched him with love before? Had he LET any one or anything touch him before? Since words can not be empolyed, the bond between any ""animal"" and human is a profound one because it is based totally upon trust, compassion, and the unspoken communication of love. For me, I completely bought into the love between Ann and Kong, which made the end of the film heartwrenching for me. So, if the success of a film is measured by the degree it touches the viewer, this film hit the bullseye! It is truly THE best remake ever - far outdistancing itself from the original!!!"	5.0	The BEST Kong yet!	2006-03-30	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1UMH0DPGQHU18	Akshay Singh	When I was first going to see this film, I was a little apprehensive on whether it would live up to its hype. However, I was not to be disappointed. This film is one of the best I have ever seen (and I am an ultra movie-buff), and in my opinion beats all of the Lord of the Rings films, save for the Return of the King. The action was awesome (and at times, a bit brutal and excessive), and it got your heart-rate up and had you totally immersed. But, some of the films better moments were the quieter ones, the ones in which Kong interacts with the damsel Ann Darrow (an underwhelming performance by Naomi Watts, I'm sorry to say). Kong is so realistic that, sometimes he even seems human. The final fight sequence/ending scene is heart-rending, and it is difficult  to resist applauding Jackson's sheer ingenuity when the credits roll around. This film is definitely the true definition of an epic masterpiece, and though it has its problems, its a poignant film that's not to be missed!	5.0	A beautiful, epic masterpiece by the master Peter Jackson!	2006-05-30	5	2	3

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2UTOJMF0LXFN4	Alan C. Davis	Giving the original King Kong an A, I would have to give this one a solid B. The deleted scenes should have been in Jackson's original version and much of the early New York scenes cut. Only enough of the New York scenes were needed to set the time and characters. The rest was a waste of film. The creature computer effects are stunning as is the scenery on Skull Island. The human characters are so so character wise and Jack Black as Carl Denham was terrible. Naomi Watts did give a fairly good performance though. The star of the film of course is Kong ( played by Andy Serkis using motion capture )and the Weta team did an incredible job of making him truely believable.If you own a Bluray player, that disc contains both versions and is stunning in Hi Def.	4.0	Peter Jackson's Kong Review	2006-02-17	10	8	2

From the moment they reached King Kong's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience. I felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape. How can anyone feel anything for King Kong? He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1REC8O7PZB3XG	alexander	I went to see King Kong last friday, and I was totally impressed by this extraordinary vision of Peter Jackson.I have always been a fan of the Kong myth ever since I first saw the underrated 1976 film, and later the 1933 original, and let me just say that this one is better than both, yes, even better than the original.Peter Jackson has created a fantastically monumental masterpiece, which I'm affraid the average american moviegoer or film critic will never quite appreciate because of their blatant ignorance and superficiality.This movie has some very fine points, hidden from these people, which make it much more than just another giant gorilla flick.That's why there are many bad reviews about it, and it hasn't lived up to its hype in the box office (even though its still early to say), because it's not for the common, insensitive people.The action is breathtaking and thrilling, but the true power of the film rests on certain details, that a lot of people will never understand, it made me remember my childhood, the women that I loved, and even the memory of my long gone pet Bouvier, in a way that no movie had ever done.One of the best parts was actually trashed by these imbecile critics, the frozen lake sequence had something that made me happy and sad in an unexplainable feeling that translated into some tears.It's much more than the age old tale of Beauty and the Beast, it's an amazingly powerful story that Jackson has conceived in such a manner that can only be appreciated through your heart and soul.Thank you Mr. Jackson, you have done it again.	5.0	One of the best movies ever made.	2005-12-19	3	1	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	"In order to get myself in the mood for this new version of Kong I decided to watch the original one again, just to get into the spirit of things. Part of me, now after seeing this movie, wishes I hadn't and part of me is glad I did.I'm glad I did because now I can comment more accurately on this film's strenghts and weaknesses. I'm not glad I did for exactly the same reasons. I don't want to compare and contrast the two movies. I wanted to either love or hate this version of Kong on its own merits. I'll try my best to do just that.There is good news and bad news with this movie that is surprisingly getting a wonderful reaction from critics and the public. Roger Ebert, The New York Post, and The New York Daily News have all given the movie four stars! The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune also wrote favorably reviews. And as far as public reaction goes just check the average star rating here on amazon.But I'm not convinced this is a great movie. First of all I never thought the original was a great movie. A great piece of filmmaking? You bet! If for any reason its innovation in the genre. It practically created it. For that you have to give the original credit. But a great movie? No. An entertaining, exciting ride? Sure. That is more or less (mostly less) how I feel about Peter Jackson's remake.I'll start things off with the good news. This new version helps us understand Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) a bit more. The original never really dwelled too much on the character, which is a shame. There were a lot of possibilities to play around with it. This new version also shows audiences the grim realities of the times. I suspect this was done largely because the audience that goes to see this film will mostly be children. At least this was the case in the theatre I attended. And finally obviously the production value on this film is greater than the original. Much more money was put into making King Kong look more realistic. If there was such a thing as a 20, 25 foot gorilla I suppose this is what it would look it. Although this is not necessarily a good thing. I always felt the original Kong, even though you could argue looked fake, had a certain amount of charm to it. It actually worked with the whole fantasy idea behind the movie.I also liked the references to the original. There is a funny line of dialogue (well at least I found it funny, no one else in the theatre did) between Carl Denham (Jack Black) the director and his assisant, Preston (Colin Hanks) when discussing who they can get to star in the movie. Preston names people such as Myrna Loy and Mae West and soon Carl says what about Fay. But Preston informs him she's doing something for RKO to which Carl says in disgust, probably with Cooper. The reference relates to Fay Wray, Merian C. Cooper (director of the original Kong) and RKO, the studio where the film was made.There is also a scene when we see them shooting the movie within the movie, the dialogue is actually taken from the original.Now comes the bad news. The thing that bothered me most about this movie was the relationship between Darrow and Kong. In a word it's creepy. And when I say creepy I mean creepy. Ann actually starts to feel compassion towards the beast. She actually gets mad at the people trying to protect her from it. She stands in front of them and cries out ""No!!"" Is she fcuking nuts!In 1933 when Fay Wray was captured by Kong and taken atop the Empire State Building we sensed fear. I'm here to write Fay has nothing to be ashamed of. Fear is a perfectly rational reaction when you are in the grips of a giant gorilla. I probably would have wet myself. But here when Ann is captured she tells Kong he's beautiful! Jackson is actually trying to milk these scenes for romance. They are taking this far too serious. And for me this ruins a bit of the movie and lessens Watts' performance. Her reaction is not normal. I understand movies are suppose to be the stuff of make believe, but this is taking things a bit too far. I'll accept there is such a beast as Kong. I'll accept there is an island with dinosaurs running around. And I'd accept the fact that some director would want to get this all on film. But I'm sorry, I can't accept a woman falling in love with a monkey, a real monkey! There is even a scene where they go ice skating. Are you people reading this!?I also felt the movie over stays its welcome. It is three hours long. The original was an hour and a half. That felt a bit too short. The movie should have been about two hours. The reason this movie runs so long is because it is flooded with action scenes. Some work and truly kept me on the edge of my seat, a scene with Ann, Kong and some dinosaurs, but a lot of them just started to bore me. There were too many and they didn't help advance the plot. The original smartly knew this and limited much of these scenes.Then there is the acting. I don't really have a problem with many of the people in this movie except for Jack Black. He's not able to deliver the movie's famous lines correctly. Sometimes he says them in such a bland way they lose all meaning and other times he's going overboard. In the end he was just a bad choice for the character.But back to the romance. This romance destroys all meaning of the film's famous last line, ""it was beauty killed the beast."" In the original it made sense because Ann was afraid of Kong. So in a way Kong had to prove myself to Ann. He had to show her he loved her and in doing so he died. There it really was a case of beauty killing the beast. In this movie he already won the girl! She actually, I think, prefers his company over Jack Driscoll (Adrian Brody) the movie within the movie's screenwriter. In this verison of Kong, no it wasn't beauty killed the beast it was defintely the planes that got him.Bottom-line: At times enjoyable and disappointing remake of the 1933 film. Jackson does improve upon certain elements but I found myself turned off by the cheesy romance and the character development."	3.0	Nothing To Go Apes Over	2005-12-17	28	12	16
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AH4SL0YL5AQVU	Alric the Red	With every element the stroke of an artist, Peter Jackson's rendering of the venerable classic was an act of love, managing to utilize the best in modern film techniques while maintaining an old-fashioned aesthetic.  Nail-biting adventure, outstanding special effects, a beautiful woman, idealistic hero, and a land that time forgot -- it's a masterwork of a film.  It took everything the original film was, then trumped it.  What did we love about the original when we were children?  Why, we loved the journey to a mysterious island, modern man doing battle and surviving against prehistoric monsters.  But in 1933, special effects were more difficult to incorporate without the effect itself becoming obvious.  Not so now.  So this is the film the original version would have been had the studio had the technology.  This is a fair assumption, considering that the studio in that day had devised every special effect conceivable and necessary to bring the creatures of the island to life.  A stellar achievement, but Jackson took it the rest of the way.The crowning jewel in this masterpiece of thrills is Kong himself.  It was one of the most remarkable things ever, and one can only assume that it's the harbinger of even greater things to come as this technology advances.  Kong's face alone was the work of artists with an eye for living details, dabbed as it was with touches that bespoke of Kong's martial history prior to our arrival.  His scarred visage and an asymmetrical row of broken dentition were a tacit testimony of his struggle to keep his place at the top of a brutal hierarchy.  A brilliant touch.  Andy Serkis's motion-capture performance took full advantage of the cutting-edge animation, and brought Kong to life in a way previously unattainable.  The ape was more than some special effect.  He was a giant pet.I've seen Jackson's movie about five or six times now, and thisBlu-Ray editiontwice.  Oh, man, if you thought it was something to behold in the SD DVD, you'll be astounded by the same lush beauty revealed in exquisite hi-def.  Some scenes, already so breathtaking in SD, engulf you now as you sit before a searing sunset, your eyes splashed with it.  And sweetening the deal further, this release includes both the theatrical version and the even better Director's Cut.  I'm happy to report that the longer cut wasn't a cynical ploy to sell Kong to us again by extending scenes or stretching out the battles.  Two new casualty-tallying confrontations with dinosaurs were restored to the narrative, one of which includes some expositional material on Carl Denham's deeper plunge into obsession.As for special features, you have U-Control, through which you can access various picture-in-picture making-of featurettes.  From what I can tell, there's no way to play them without a P-in-P capability, unlike other Blu-ray discs that permit access straight from the menu.  Admittedly I haven't tried hard, because none of that matters much to me.  The main thing is that this superbly produced adventure is now even more gorgeous and more impressive.I can't see how anyone who likes the original version can possibly fail to enjoy this tenfold.  Aside from the special effects, the cast turned in performances that seemed far more natural when contrasted with the acting methods in 1933, which are now so dated by their barking speech cadences.  Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll portrayed the writer as intelligently aloof, reserved in word and action, but intense and soulful. Naomi Watts treats the material of an inherently absurd situation with exactly the right gravity, making us feel something, but not too much, settling for a pleasant sentimentality. As for Jack Black as Denham, I had a little trouble at first with his presence due to his work as a comedian.  However, he too was an excellent choice.  While possessing less range as an actor than his co-stars, his character was shallower, so it was a good fit after all.  As was everyone else.  Even if some characters were mere sketches, they were very good sketches.While the merits of the 1933 version are undeniable, kudos to Peter Jackson for fully achieving the original intent.  I'm unconvinced there's a rational reason for anyone who likes the first film to dislike this one.  As a person who's pretty sentimental myself, normally I'd agree with holding on to something strictly for the sake of nostalgia.  But this is the definitive edition, and just too good, making it easy to let go; andKing Kong [Blu-ray] makes it even easier.___________________________________________________________________________	5.0	King Kong in Blu-ray	2009-02-26	1	1	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1N1UN3KSXKPAE	"Amazon Customer ""Army Officer"""	"I'm amazed that so many people liked this movie.  In every way that it touches on the original, it fails miserably.  Carl Denham, based on director Marion C. Cooper and presented as a showman at the top of his form in the original, is presented as a loser and con man who has almost no track record and who lies to everyone throughout the movie.  Jack Black's portrayal is so low key that you wonder why anyone would follow this guy across the street, much less to the South Pacific.  Ann Darrow is portrayed as too good for burlesque, but not too good to steal an apple from a vendor (something that the original's Ann refused to do, even though she was starving).  The natives on Skull Island may be the most unsympathetic of all.  Shown as quaint primitives in the original, they're transformed to bloodthirsty headhunters in this remake.  Yes, they're scarier, but we get no sense of what it is that they're scared of, as the ""bride of Kong"" sacrifice/ceremony has been removed, so that when they kidnap Ann (done, not by rowing up to the ship, but by pole-vaulting across the rough seas and dragging her back on a rope easily covered the better part of a mile and whose weight would have dragged her under), we don't know what's in store (well, yeah, we do, but only because we've seen the original).  The CGI animations of the monsters of Skull Island are abour as perfect as we've come to expect, but so what?  We've seen stampeding dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, and the combat between Kong and the three T-Rexes involves him tossing Ann around as if he were juggling her.  The constant jolts would have killed her long before the end of the fight, which went on far too long.  The NYC sequences are gorgeous, but again, the action makes very little sense.  The sequence of Kong chasing Driscoll in the cab owed more to the Godzilla remake than to Kong, and the sequence between Ann and Kong in Central Park is so idiotic as to defy description (giant ape on ice with girl in skimpy evening gown, shouldn't she be frozen stiff by the time they got to the top of the Empire State Building?).  Yeah, I know, these sound like nitpicks, but when a three-hour movie fails to engage, you have all of the time in the world to pick it apart.Save your money and buy the original.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1NPZV9IORNOXZ	"Amazon Customer ""Dulcimer Maker"""	For the first 45 minutes to an hour my wife and I were really pleased with this film. It was engaging; it started to develop the story and the characters, and promised to be really entertaining. In fact, it reminded me of how effectively movie makers of the 1930's and 40's could tell a story and engage you in the telling of it. Then, the main characters reached the island of Skull Mountain and the special effects began to run amok in the film much like King Kong ran amok in New York city.Once the special effects were introduced, they violently (very violently, in fact) wrenched away control of the story from the director and began an almost non-stop convulsion, a flood, an avalanche, a torrent of mindless computer-generated effects. Kong stomping dinosaurs. Dinosaurs stomping men. Men stomping giant insects. Kong contemplating the sunset. It was as if the XF crew became addicted and lost control of the sequences, and could no longer discern when special effects were helpful and required to move the story along or when they were thoughtlessly trampling on it. Overdone? Holy cow!At one point the graphics people push the story so far out of the way they decided, for whatever bizarre reason, that it would be really good to show King Kong ice skating in Central Park! They were wrong.I was lured to this film because I was familiar with the story, and because this 2005 re-telling won the Academy Award for Visual Effects. In fact, many of the visual effects are stunning -- but only when they are not ridiculously over done, and that is not often enough.My assessment is that when the film is good, it is very, very good. But when it is bad, it is horrid. Unfortunately the good part lasts less than half way through.	2.0	A Little Girl With a Little Curl	2007-11-02	1	0	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1P5D6RTT42XO8	Amazon Customer	I'm not a big fan of overhyped multi-hour sloughs through Hollywood bloat.  The original film was way better than this and it was half the time. I thought the casting was excellent, except for Jack Black.  I'm a fan of his work, but he seemed really out of place in this movie.  I hated the dinosaurs and the giant insect sequences that didn't seem to ever end.  The bizarre love triangle between girl-big gorilla-boy was toned down quite a bit from the 77 version, but still felt out of place.  However, my biggest gripe of this movie is why did it need to be three hours.  I did not see anything in this version that wasn't in the original or the remake in 77 that suggested it should last three hours.  I understand that there is an extended version, of what, Naomi Watts trimming her toenails, or Jack Black throwing back a couple at the local bar.  Maybe Peter Jackson, fresh from finishing the superb Lord Of the Rings trilogy, can't make a movie anymore that comes in under three hours.  There are movies that deserve a three hour treatment because the subject matter is so complex or interesting, King Kong was not one of them.	2.0	Skip The Three Hour Tour and Watch the Original in Half the Time	2006-10-21	25	15	10

The only real extra on this disk is the excellent commentary by Jackson and Boyens.  All the other extras, documentaries and featurettes are missing from this (or any) BD.  This is particularly annoying when the director brings something up in the commentary but then says ""we won't go into that now, as we covered it in the documentary"".  I'm a huge fan of both his movies and the extras Jackson has included in other releases, but I'm not about to buy the DVD version of the film just to get them, when I already have the BD.As its been several years since the original BD was released, I can only assume no ultimate edition of the movie is coming, so I'll never see the extras the DVD buyers got.

This is truly visual film in every sense of the word.The actors did the best they could with the few lines they had. Casting was OK, but could have been much better, period clothes and sets looked real.The only reason to see this film is for the great Kong himself. When he's holding his lovely it looks pretty cheesey but when he's ripping the city apart and haulin ass around town it's worth the early movie ticket price.When leaving the theater I didn't hear ANYONE talking about the film, that's a bad sign.

She was correct, the old Cinema classic has come of age.  This intense love story is filled to the brim with passion.  The action has you on the edge of your seat.  The glimmers of humor come at just the right time.  Not bad for a film that has been remade so many times that most everyone knows every piece of the story line.The film isn't perfect.  My daughter just kept saying ""I can't believe this isn't rated 'R'"".  Once again she is correct.  The violence is over the top.  This movie reminded me of a combination of ""King Kong"", ""Love Story"", ""Jurassic Park"", and ""Final Destination"".  It might not be everyone's choice.Another drawback is the length.  About 2/3 of the way through the film one begins to realize that it still has a long way to go.  If you watched Peter jackson's, ""Lord of the Rings"", you might get the same feeling of length with ""King Kong"".All in all it is dynamic film, probably one of the best of the year.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1VHK9A4VLJTHC	"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly"""	"Is this film good?  Sure.  Both entertaining and filled with lots of great special effects, however, it's not great, and that's a shame because the potential was there.I read that the original Kong had a bug scene that was cut because it was too gruesome (at least for that age) and that the bug scene in this film was a bit of a homage to that lost footage.  It should have been cut too, along with another hour or so of this often over hyper story line.  It wasn't that the bug scene in the modern Kong is too gruesome, it was actually very well done, as far as bug eats man scenes go, it was just out of place, too long and detracted from the movie.  Plus it added another ""saved in the nick of time event"" and there were about six too many of those.If a movie is going to have us, the viewer, suspend belief about something, like say that there is a huge gorilla, or a spider man or whatever, that's fine, it's what fantasy and science fiction are all about, however, don't try and make us believe the impossible over and over again in a movie, it's just not fun after a certain point.Case in point, there is a scene in the movie in which dinosaurs go on a stampede.  It was totally out of place (it looked like it belonged in Jurassic Park-right down to the raptors) and it was too long AND it had nothing to do with King Kong, remember, the reason we went to see the movie in the first place, and finally if that scene had actually happened, everyone would have died and the movie would have been over.Okay, so besides that some of the casting stunk, but let me get to what was right.The cgi done for Kong was absolutely amazing, I mean I thought Aslan was done wonderfully in the LWW, but since he had to be made to speak and be more than an animal, while Kong just had to be a animal (albeit an intelligent one), I think the characterization of Kong was several levels of order higher in amazement.  It really looked like a twenty five foot tall gorilla showed up for filming.Also amazing was the background and set design for 1930's New York.  Just the scenes showing New York in that period were worth going to see the film for.As for the problem with having a creature be the main focus of a film, Kong did much better than movies like Godzilla, however in that flop of a movie they actually got a little better on screen chemistry going between the human elements than they did here, like I said, I think there was some problems in both the casting and the chemistry, but it wasn't totally horrible or anything.Okay, so should you see this?  I think so, many people are raving about it, I thought it was good, and worth going to the big screen to see it too.  Just make sure you're well rested and if you have back problems that you take something before you go."	3.0	The good, the bad ang the ugly	2006-01-09	6	3	3

Now whereas I was not quite as enthralled as I was with ROTK, this is still a stunning spectacle, even if 3hours is bit of a marathon.The set design, and base for the story are that of the 1933 original flick, set in depression hit New York, and starring Jack Black as a zealous (to say the least) film producer. We find him running from his financial backers after they decide to pull the plug, and charming and bribing his way onto a ship bound for ""Skull Island"" to make his masterpiece. Along the way he picks up struggling stage artist Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow, and manages to delay Adrian Brody (as screen writer Jack Driscoll) on board long enough to not only avoid paying him, but getting him to finish the movie script he intends to shoot. I'm going to end the synopsis here, as too many reviews have gone into way too much detail (spoilers included) already, and most people know the original anyway (this one albeit mirroring that only loosely).Once on the island we meet Kong, and as well as a whole host of Weta SfX departments creations in some great scenes, although some are rather silly it seems.The picture is not exceptional, but from the point of view of enterntainment it's great. Visually stunning, and very fast paced after thirty minutes or so, you will laugh, jump, and even squirm at many of the scenes. The acting is top notch as well, and Jackson still it seems has a knack in the Editors chair as well. It was nice to see Andy Sirkis in a support role, as well as many other recognisable faces. A lot of people have bemoaned the overloaded CGI, but this IS entertainment folks - if they had had that kind of technology in 1933, they would have used it, trust me. My only real complaint is the running time, this is NOT LOTR, and didn't need to be 3 hours long,(even the restored original is only 104 mins) and sometimes too much padding gets in the way - case in point is the ending, which is especially drawn out. All that said, go see it for yourself - it WILL be one of the most talked about films of the holidays, and sure to rake it in big at the box office, so treat yourself and see what we're all talking about.

Despite what other people are saying about the CG effects, it is really only even barely noticeable on the stampede scene. Most people don't even realize how much special effects are used in the movie. Do you think King Kong is a man in a suit? Do you think Peter Jackson traveled back in time to film on location in new york city? Pretty much the whole movie is using some 3d graphics and green screen work.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3EW4TUSY1HAXC	Andrew Mcdonald	"There are very few remakes that live up to the original's reputation and for many good reasons:1. we already know, more or less, how the story goes.2. the original is often an almost perfect film which explains why the movie is being remade: many fans could be suckered into seeing an inferior remake.All great remakes not only must put a spin on the original story but they also must prove that a retelling of the story was necessary.  Off the top of my head I can think of two films that meet this criteria: The Fly (1986) and The Thing (1982).King Kong (2005) is also one of those rare remakes.The most refreshing part of this movie is that there is an underlying and always present emotional dimension to this version which the 1933 version lacked.  Unlike most movies today, the characters (especially Anne) are given plenty of time to develop so that we actually care about them when the action gets underway.  The interpersonal relationships certainly have a greater depth than the original.  Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this movie is that there is an emotional relationship between Kong and Anne that, I'm thrilled to say, somehow works.  I absolutely loved how they could share something as simple as sunset together and take just enough time to enjoy the wonder of it all.The characters are more fluid, less one-dimensional, more nonchalant, and just plain better than the original's wooden actors (""say, I think I love you"" as an example).  When I say this, I include King Kong who is a surprisingly good actor (even if he is CGI).  He's not portrayed as some misunderstood creature (like the horrible Godzilla remake) or a ruthless creature (King Kong 1933) but like we would expect: an animal.  Nothing more, nothing less.  At the end of the movie I discovered, to my utter astonishment, that I actually almost cried when the CGI creature was slipping off the Empire State Building.  And I am a 23 year old, 230 pound, 6'3"", adult male and I never cry at movies!It's worth mentioning that this film contains some of the best CGI stuff to date and also, what have to be some of the most beautiful scenes in all cinematic history.  I especially loved seeing New York City during the 1930s.Technically the condensed 1933 version may be a ""better"" film but, of the two, I prefer this one.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2QA9K9Z0XRR0D	Andy. Gillum	Jaw-dropping.  Heart-stopping.  Heartbreakingly tragic and sad.  All those and more describe the best movie of `05 & one of the best of all-time.  King Kong has always been a classic idea but neither the `33 original or the `78 remake was able to develop a fully realized story.Jackson somehow managed to push all the right buttons: keeping the original characters (albeit with neccessary personality changes) while making them more 3-dimensional than either the `33 original or the `78 remake was able to, adding welcome new characters, keeping the prehistoric Skull Island from the original that was so full of life & dangers and the decision to keep it set in 1933.  Jackson's true stroke of genius began around the 1:20 mark when he did what the first 2 writers should've done: he developed a mutual bond between Ann & Kong, breaking the `creature feature' mold.  From then on, Ann (who's instantly a likeable, sympathetic character) goes on a rollercoaster ride of sad, sadder, & saddest starting with her rescue from some hungry T-Rexes that leads to a growing affection for Kong to her tragic mistake of trying to escape with Jack that leads to Kong's capture to her reunion with him & the tragedy that follows.  You're left with the feeling she regrets ever leaving the jungle but not ever having met Kong.If I listed everything I loved about this film, it would be a page long.  So, let me finish by saying this: for a movie I almost passed on watching (fearing it would be just a fancy remake), this was one of the best, thrilling, saddest, sweetest & most satisfying movies I've ever seen.

Not to mention the original landmark film.  I was one of those who bought it when it first came out and thus was mad when I saw they were coming out with another one with deleted scenes.  I would have saved my money and waited.  So the question I asked myself was do I want to spend the money and buy a movie I already have.  I read that there might be a scene where they show Kong actually in the boat being taken back to New York.  Something that confuses me to this day.  But, alas, it is not there.  Still there are added scenes with dinosaurs in the jungle and that is worth buying this new edition for.  Fortunatley, they didn't make the first part of the movie before they get to the island any longer.  That was long enough.  But, added jungle scenes with a triceratops and others are fun and you wish they had left them in the original movie.  If you do not have King Kong already buy this one.  If you have it and love it, like me, then you won't be sorry you bought this one too.

Peter Jackson pays homage to the original blockbuster film KING KONG of 1933. So many scenes, down to the nuances are remade to perfection in this classic. The acting is fantastic and the action is unbelievable. Some of the greatest CGI work of our time is done in this film. You will believe this 25' ape is living and breathing on screen with Naomi Watts. If you have never seen the original, it is a story of a filmaker that sets sail for a prehistoric island. This place where civilized man has yet to step foot, where mysterious wonders await. When the damsel in distress is captured she is offered up to Kong as a sacrifice. The crew saves her and captures the beast for display and profit. Soon Kong is loose and recaptures the fair maiden. This leads to one of film's alltime great moments as Kong battles bi-planes at the top of the Empire State Building!King Kong is a classic and Peter Jackson's love for it, is on full display. The movie is long as it should be. Great storytelling should never take shortcuts! A must own for any movie lover!NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Universal does it again! The picture and sound are breathtakingly beautiful. This disc gives you both the theatrical and extended versions. Please watch the extended, it is so worth it.

This is one of those movies I had to see. I was a big fan of the original. I even liked the one with Charles Grodon. Yeah I thought it was funny. The most important thing to me in watching this remake was for Dinosaur fights with Kong. I have been a serious monster movie fan since I was a kid. I saw every Claymation/Men in rubber suite movie I could. Godzilla is still King! The only recent movie that had a cool Dino fight was Jurassic Park 3. I loved it and wanted more so to hear about not one, but three T-Rex's fighting Kong was awesome! Well, for the most part I liked the fight scene. I agree that three Rex's was a bit much however that's not my main complaint. I would love if the editors or whoever was primarily responsible for that scene could have watched it more and considered keeping the cameras focused a bit longer. More static cameras and not so much fast jerky movement. I so wanted to soak in a childhood dream come true, but the camera kept jumping from one perspective to another and moving point of view so fast I kept wishing it would stop. I also agree with a previous review concerning Kong being seriously bit with little damage. I also think Kong delt some serious blows with his powerful punches and I was sure he at least took one of those Rex's out! But no! I wanted to like the movie and that particular scene more than I did. My other gripes are the natives. What kind of freaks were they? And that brontosaurus scene, I thought it was stupid. Also, did someone else have the task of producing that? The mix of live actors and Dino's looked phony. I was so shocked by that. A big budget movie like this should at least get that right. Movies seem to have that kind of effect nailed these days. I also prefer the reveal of Kong in the first two Kong movies. Of course the beginning was too long. I heard it was too long and thought it wouldn't be that bad, but it  was. I didn't care for the giant bugs and worms. That could have been done better. What did I like? I liked Kong and Naomi Watts. I had no problem with her and Kong having a bond on the island. It made sense that she realized she needed him to protect her. Why she seemed to like Kong more than Jack I didn't get. So I liked much of the movie, but alot could have been done better or different.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3LTZGHZBBBQX0	Anthony L.	Peter Jacksondoes not work by halves. When the legendary director turned his eye to remaking a childhood favourite film: the classic tale of a giant ape, the woman he loved, and the planes that stood between them...he didn't make your typical blockbuster. KING KONG is over 3 hours long, and the first hour of it isn't action. He put Jack Black in a (mostly) dramatic role, and for the role of Kong, he cast a human actor.The result is an exercise in splendid, passionate, completely over-the-top film-making. KING KONG is a giant ape of a film: sometimes loud, energetic, perhaps a bit dumb, but there's no mistaking where it's big heart lies. Passionate is the right word for the film. Jackson, with those wacky geniuses at Weta Workshops behind him, throws himself completely into every detail of the production, digging deep into his creepy-crawly, horror film past to deliver a rich and immersive world.The performances are uniformly excellent, and filled with heart. In the title role, we haveAndy &#34;Gollum&#34; Serkis- an absolute genius of an actor who's played a primate no less than twice in his career. His jaw-dropping performance as Kong manages to make the giant ape relatable and moving.Naomi Wattsis sympathetic and rather stunning as Ann Darrow, an actress who gets drawn into a singular relationship with a giant ape. In the supporting cast, we find an excellent Jack Black and Adrien Brody, and Andy Serkis AGAIN, that man of many hats.But what sets King Kong above your usual blockbuster is the level of detail put into the design of the film. In particular, the creatures of the lush, terrifying Skull Island would make Ray Harryhausen turn over in his grave. No longer harnessed by budget and stop-motion, Peter Jackson allows his imagination to run completely wild, conjuring a gorgeous land filled with terrifying and fantastical creatures. Tyrannosaurs, brontosaurs, velociraptors, man-eating worms, giant fish, and loads of creepy-crawlies all beset our heroes in true Hammer Horror fashion.Now, most of the CGI works, and some of it doesn't in particular a brontosaur chase sequence is clearly green-screen. In addition to this, many would argue that the screenplay needs real trimming. While on the subject of cons, let's top it off by saying that one too many characters turn up at *juust* the right moment to be realistic.But why am I talking about realistic? This is big, immersive, emotional and visual entertainment that doesn't reject plausibility so much as FLAUNT it's fantasticality! On top of this, Peter Jackson clearly has respect for the original that shines through the CGI. This is one giant of a film, about one giant of an ape! 4.5 beast-killing beauties!P.S.

It's a real cinematic wonder! Indeed!I have read an interview (published on NY Times I guess) on kongisking.net with a primatologist which works for the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International who said that Kong is authentic not only by its moves or the way he picked up objects but ""Kong's protective nature - Gorillas will defend members of their family to the death"" and - as said by the primatologist - ""Kong laughed in the movie - Gorillas do laugh""This movie brings us what we seek in the movies - at least what I seek in movies - action, drama, romance, emotion! I think Kong is TRULY AMAZING!!!I really enjoyed the all-action sequences in Skull Island because it developes the drama and the danger of this menacing Island! And it's pure cinema and pure entertaining!That said - this is one of my 2005 favorite movies!Thanks - AGAIN - for the wisdom and magic of Peter Jackson!It's reaaally good!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ARA48345JZPZR	Archmaker	"I am not a fan of remakes of classic movies.  If it was done right the first time, let it alone.  The original King Kong is a classic of imagination that captured this 9 year old boy as much as it did Peter Jackson at that age.  Then, of course, one grows up and realizes that the 1930's movie is a prisoner of its time, locked into perceptions about primitive cultures, savagery, race, and the nature of the beast itself.  And we forgive its flaws because it is a ripping good yarn and,whether intentional or not,the great heart of the story is sadness at the beast's destruction.  Even when deleted footage was restored showing a Kong not quite as loveable as the orginal theatrical version (what with him crushing natives like cigarette butts, dropping brunettes dozens of stories, biting heads etc.) the indelible ending of the film is Kong's sacrifice and his devotion to Ann to his very death.  It was probably the first time a movie elicited tears of pity from 9 year old eyes.Peter Jackson in his love for that film has wisely not so much  re-made Kong as he has re-imagined that film.  It was an absolutely correct decision to keep King Kong in its original time of the 1930's, allowing Jackson to retain and expand the look of the original while deftly altering some of the original's quainter notions.  Jackson has kept the heart of the original, while having fun parodying some of its outdated concepts, especially with the stage show surrounding Kong's Broadway debut.  Keeping it in the 30's somehow also retains thesense of plausible wonder.Likewise, the decision to make this King Kong resemble exactly a real silverback gorilla was spot on. In the years since King Kong we have come to know that gorillas, while hugely powerful animals are rather shy and gentle vegetarians if not threatened. We have seen Koko ostensibly signing to her keepers and petting her kitten. It was overdue to correct the perception of the wild ape. Jackson had to choose between the ""monster on the loose"" aspect or a more subtle view of the beast, and I believe his choice was correct.This Kong is fearsome, but with threats removed, he is a sad and gentle creature.  Showing the many bones of dead Kong-sized gorillas strewn about his lair, quietly informs us that he is probably the last of his kind, surviving alone in a very hostile world.  His visage is scarred and weary.  It is another brilliant stroke that helps explain the relationship that develops between Ann and Kong.And speaking of Ann, Naomi Watts is.....lovely.  Stunningly, heart-breakingly lovely.  My father was infatuated with Fay Wray, something I fully understood when I saw the original Kong on the big screen.  Fay was gorgeous too, but not much was asked of her beyond screaming a lot.  Jackson has corrected what many of us alway wanted from the original, one moment of recognition from Fay Wray's Ann that Kong has saved her life several times, and would and will die for her. Jackson builds that recognition in Naomi Watt's Ann to a relationship of trust and care that is touching and moving.  The scene of them sliding on the ice in Central Park is beautiful and and absolutely inspired.The other changes in the film are fine by me.  The movie takes its time in the early going, laying a foundation of the 1930's Depression Jackson probably thought necessary to explain to a modern audience (and not needed for the original audience experiencing it when they left the theatre) and expanding characters and the setting aboard the ship.  Patience was rewarded because once they hit Skull island it was hellzapopin from there on out.The movie is spectacular to look at, from the brilliantly conceived Skull Island, to Kong's mountaintop lair, to nighttime 1930's New York, to the aforementioned Central Park scene, and finally to the faithfully re-imagined stand on top of the Empire State Building in a gorgeously dawning New York.  A wonderful homage to the original, all the while retaining its own brilliance and integrity, this is a fine film, and Peter Jackson can be proud that he has paid tribute to the original all the while bringing to it his own heart and vision. Well worthwhile."	5.0	Re-imagining Kong	2005-12-20	0	0	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3R5FYKWQLW7IX	Artiste	Peter Jackson's King Kong is a magnificent, fun filled, epic masterpiece! While paying brilliant homage to the original King Kong of 1933, this modern re-telling of the tale is just as thrilling and just as good. The two lead characters, Ann Darrow played by the wonderful Naomi Watts and Kong himself, played in part by Andy Serkis and in part by a team of computer animators will thrill you with the tragic tale of a lonely, giant, montrous ape who falls for a beautiful girl from New York City. Kong is so beautufully rendered in this film, you will swear he is real...the best CGI character ever put on celluloid. And fasten your seat belts when Kong fights a trio of V-Rexes in the middle of the film to save Ann, it's a top-notch, thrilling blend of action/storytelling and CGI animation. As a whole, the film will take you on roller-coaster-like-journey from depression era New York City to Skull Island and back all the way up to the top of the Empire State Building where Jackson directs a finale that will leave you both breathless and heart-wrenchingly sad. The best film of the year in my opinion, and maybe even the best film I've seen in a long, long time.	5.0	A Magnificent Epic	2006-02-13	7	6	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1T9PJBFBFKSGD	Auburn Niewiadomski	"My review of Peter Jackson's King Kong remake will include my opinions about the film and discuss the extensive amount of bonus material on this extended three disc set, so if you're still interested grab a seat cause were just getting started.I've never had any special attachment to the King Kong franchise, but I have always found the premise intriguing and a joy to watch. I have seen the original stop motion cinema classic, the unappreciated 1976 remake and now the most recent 2005 remake by director Peter Jackson. And if I had to choose from the three, I would honestly choose this version. Now you may be angry but please let me explain why, I'm not saying this version is without its flaws, there are many but I personally found the bond between Ann Darrow and Kong better than the original classic. In the original film despite Kong saving her numerous times she's still terrified and screams almost constantly. But of course it was an older film and that film is still superior to most horror/adventure films to this day. And like I said, it was a horror film, in horror films women scream... a lot. But now times have changed and today's movie plot's have changed and I think this remake came at a good time. Another reason I appreciate this film is because Peter Jackson grew up a big fan of the original classic and he had a passion for this project, and you can tell by the finishing product. To me this film felt like following several different sub stories. Ann's struggle finding work as an actress, and her struggle to survive after being captured by Kong, Carl Denham's who is struggling as a film director and feels he has a chance to revive his career if he can find ""Skull Island"" and film it, Jack Driscoll's love for Ann and of course Kong's, who is a lonely animal and probably the last of his species. But there are also many other sub plots with the men of the ""Venture"" and they are also interesting to follow.But to me the most important reason why this is my favorite Kong film is because I became emotionally attached with Kong, I felt sorry for this beast that had no escape while fighting off the airplanes at the top of the empire state building and the reason is because of the incredible, and I do mean incredible special effects. King Kong and the creatures all look absolutely fantastic, and Kong's eyes really have emotion in them. But we can't give all the credit to special effects, many of Kong's life like emotions from the film came from Andy Serkis, who helped with the movements and facial expressions for Kong and there is some very interesting footage of Andy acting as Kong in the bonus material. You really have to see the creatures of Skull Island for yourself, to the gigantic insects or the mega ton dinosaurs they all just look so life like. But unfortunately I do have some complaints, but before I complain yes I do know this is a film from Hollywood, it's just a movie and King Kong is a ridiculous film if it's taken seriously. But how in the world does Ann not get crushed by Kong?! During the huge fight with the ""V"" Rex he's fighting three, THREE V Rexes while holding her during much of it. And when Kong, Ann and the V Rex family get tangled in the vines after they fall off the cliff she at one point is holding on to a V Rexes tooth. I mean, this makes the movie so unbelievable that you can't take any of these scenes seriously. And I also found all the fight scenes on Skull Island to get repetitive. At one point there is a creature attacking while the Venture crew is paddling across the swamp, the crew falling into a pit and getting attacked by huge insects, Kong fighting the V Rexes, and a couple other prehistoric type creatures that attack but it feels like it comes at you all at once. I understand these scenes being in the movie, but if shortened and spread out I think it would make the journey through Skull Island more believable and a little less repetitive. Oh, and don't get me started on the islander's, I just found them annoying, and they just got tiresome and I'm glad they are not in the film much. Well I'm worn out, let's discuss the DVD set.For this DVD and this DVD only you get around thirteen minutes of extra footage during the movie that was not originally featured during its theatrical release, and that reason alone is a great reason to buy this DVD, but the makers of this DVD didn't stop there, but I'll get into that later. Now, the film is spread out on to two discs, as well is the commentary, but it didn't bother me at all actually. When you finish the first half of the movie on disc one you can just pop in disc two and it will have a menu that asks if you want to continue the film or commentary immediately or if you just want to go to the main menu, and really, are we all so lazy that we can't just place another disc in? We are?! Oh...well it probably won't bother you. The commentary with Peter Jackson is incredibly interesting as well, and pretty funny actually.  And also included are around forty minutes of deleted scenes with introductions with Peter Jackson. But that is just the beginning, there is also a hysterical gag reel entitled the Eighth ""Blunder"" of the World and there are a couple other goofy featurettes with the cast. But if you want to find out information about how the film was created, pop in disc three. There are so many lengthy and interesting documentaries you will just be amazed. In a category called ""Re-creating the Eighth Wonder"" the Making of King Kong, you will find several twenty to forty minute documentaries that discuss Pre-production, filming the Venture Journey, creating and filming Skull Island, creating New York In New Zealand and the crew's visit to New York, and of course the development of Kong himself. The information is so extensive that the approximate running time is around two and a half to three hours. And if you still aren't satisfied there are featurettes that pay tribute to the original King Kong and the resemblances with the original and the 2005 remake, there also is a featurette about the collectibles created during the release of King Kong, video galleries, trailers and some selected Pre-Visualization Animatics from the movie. And if you aren't satisfied after all of these fascinating bonus features...I'll be at a loss for words.Everyone has mixed feelings about this movie as do I, but I think Peter Jackson did an excellent job at capturing Kong not just as a ferocious beast, but as a caring and lonely creature, and if you want to find out how King Kong was made this three disc extended edition is a highly recommended buy."	4.0	Peter Jackson's King Kong the Deluxe Extended Edition	2010-08-29	5	3	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AXNIHQHKP52MN	Aveen B. Zachariah	Let me state that I did think the movie was decent, but I feel Jackson went overboard on this one. Honestly the first hour was so utterly boring that I had to pinch myself to stay awake. I suggested to all my friends to come an hour later, to have a much better experience than I did. Yet, I thought the effects were top notch and  also that there was some great action sequences. However, some scenes like the stupid ice skating scene with Kong and the whole story between the kid and the sailor were just ridiculous. People argue that the first hour was to set up the story, yet that wasn't really the case because most of this hour involved over-acting and boring minor stories that don't really matter. This is King Kong, it does not have to be an epic like the Lord of the Rings. Basically the story is there is a big ape,  the ape likes a girl, and the ape wrecks the city. That is it!!!!

First off let me say the movie was great. Awesome special effects of Kong, Dinos, Scenery,  Etc...got a little hokey at times, but still very enjoyable. My main gripe is to Universal Pictures. From what I have read, this movie received Oscars for Best Sound & Best Sound Editing.....why did they NOT pass this on to us??? Anybody looking for DTS/EX sound(or better) can forget it. This was actually filmed in DTS sound quality, as ALL movies of this budget and magnitude are.  I purchased the ""Special Edition"" expecting the great sound quality. I should have known when the box did not boast of it. I have a feeling that Universal will release a ""4 Disc"" Special Edition a year from now and claim ""Now Available in DTS"" so they can make a few extra bucks.Over-All I give the movie ""TWO THUMBS UP"" and I give Universal Pictures ""TWO THUMBS DOWN"".

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A5TNZXNPQKGCF	"Barry Dejasu ""the_otherness"""	"I'll make this review quick, because this epic masterpiece is just...well, an epic masterpiece.When Merian C. Cooper first made _King Kong_ in 1933 (1933!!), it was something truly one-of-a-kind that had come out of nowhere.  To this day it is considered a masterpiece of filmmaking, largely (of course) due to the mighty title character and the incredible animation which really made the picture so convincingly powerful.  There have been countless imitations (namely the entire Godzilla franchise), as well as several remakes (the forgettable Jeff Bridges flick of the `70's) and rehashes (_Mighty Joe Young_, both version of which are actually decent and original).  However, why would Peter Jackson, with all the money in the world still flooding in to him on the tails of the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy, want to re-make this film?  Because, quite simply, he loved the original, and felt that it deserved to be everything that it was and more, for audiences young and old, then and forever.I spent at least a third of the movie crying (yes, I'm serious), another third (almost) screaming and/or laughing in fairly even doses, and the other third just sitting there, absolutely amazed.First off, Kong is truly the main star, of course.  So much is told from him and his...well, his acting really, he truly is the best silent actor in decades.I've been a Naomi Watts fan for a rather brief time now, but after seeing her here, I hold her in high regards as one of my new favorite actresses.  As talented as she is downright gorgeous, she really packs a wallop, and her chemistry with Kong is heartwarming and tragic.Jack Black.  Oh my god.  I've always found him to be hilarious - the only image really associated with him until now - and so when I found out that he was going to be playing Carl Denham, I didn't know quite what to think.  Was he going to be serious?  Was he going to be funny?  Well, he was both - and now I can tell that this rendition of the character wasn't based on the actor; no, Peter Jackson chose Jack Black to be Carl Denham because *this* Carl Denham needed someone like Jack Black.  Funny, obsessive, eccentric...this was a perfect casting.Adrian Brody.  I'd only previously seen him act in _The Village_, which is not to say he left much of an impression on me (aside from loads of mentally handicapped laughter).  However, I've had respect for this young actor ever since seeing his reaction to his winning the Academy Award for Best Actor (in _The Pianist_).  And now, seeing him play as the screenwriter-turned-hero in _King Kong_, I must say I hold him in high regards as a very talented actor, and I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing him in more roles.The scenery (especially the incredible recreation of 1930's New York) was gorgeous, thick on atmosphere as well as culturally precise.The special effects were downright spectacular; I have an all-too-unfortunate ability to tell what's a special effect and what's not, and while I could easily have picked out what was real and wasn't in this movie, so convincing was the directing and editing that I simply was awed and wowed by the motions, the sounds, the monsters and backgrounds (and the actors' places therein).The score and soundtrack were excellent...from '30's songs that had both lyrical and cultural significance to the film and the setting, respectively, to James Newton Howard's effective compositions, the music was excellently involved.  Not to mention it was simply a brilliant moment when the very, very subtle score slithers into your ears during the Spider Pit sequence...and speaking of which...My father owns a book about early Hollywood films and filmmaking, and there are several great sections (including a whole chapter) dedicated to the original _King Kong_.  On one page, there is a conceptual art sketch and a film still of ""the famed Spider Pit sequence,"" which Cooper deleted from the film due to pacing constraints.  In this scene, various members of the U.S.S. Venture who fell into the ravine (after Kong shakes them off the giant fallen tree) are picked off by various slimy creatures...and judging from the sketch and the still, this would have been a rather gruesome moment in the film had it been left in.  Well, Peter Jackson included this whole scene in his movie, and it could not have been creepier and more disgusting (but effectively showing just how strange Skull Island really is).This movie is the result of a fan's dedication to a favored piece of art.  Mr. Jackson knew just how to re-create this movie without making it just another remake.  He took something already great and made it even better.  _King Kong_ is definitely the best movie I've seen all year...and may it be the same for you too."	5.0	There's just too many good things to say about this movie!	2005-12-14	17	0	17

IO LOVE Peter Jackson's LOTR's trilogy,(and some would say those movies were long, too.)  But, the difference between King Kon & LOTR's is there were characters who you CARED about there fate.  Plus, even though I hated the cuts between Treebeard & Helm's Deep,(which would have been a long battle sequence if not for the cuts,)what happens here is that Jackson OVERDOES it.  You have dinosaurs who try to bite Ann, you have what I can only think are mutated, gigantic bugs, a stampede, that you can clearly tell is CGI,(I thought I even noticed the dinosaurs legs going through the people like they were ghosts, or something.  Now, these things would have been ok at maybe 3 or 4 minutes, but, just when you think it's over, it just goes on & on.  I just wanted to scream at the screen, ENOUGH!  Just get on with it.  They could have taken out the whole bug attack & made at least a somewhat better movie.  I mean, they have these Tommy Guns & the audience is uppose to belieev they are gonna shoot bullets at this guys back with a bug on it, kill the bug, but NOT him.  I don't mind SOME suspension of disbelief, but DON'T insult my intelligents.  That guy would have been RIDDLED with bullets.  It wasn't a Walter PPK, it was a Tommy Gun, for cryin' out loud.  They coul dhave cut some of this & used it for something the movie REALLY lacked, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!!!  It's bad when you only feel for a giant monkey.

Each moment must rely on the adorned saturation of repetitive violence from both beast and man, thoroughly debasing the viewer into a cognizant netherworld where they are coerced into dormancy (the function of this mediation between the viewer and the screen).The exaltation of the 'modern city', emphasized by the advent of diversion capitalism (spectacle phenomenon), debasing the inferior instincts (beast) of man, is captured by the essence of that most propagated material of wealth, the skyscraper (phallus redefined as Empire). Eradication of the adulation in perplexity (old gods) is encouraged, devouring primitive man with a sense of immediacy of the new spectacle (the destruction of power mystified - Kong - replaced with that of diversion capitalism (spectacle phenomenon)). The falsification of love, exposed by the eternal, fraudulent turmoil within beings, further proceeds until eventually only the vacuity of man at the height of his grief is relinquished on the labyrinths of the anomic metropolis, deficient forever of mystery.	1.0	paean to the adoration of bestiality and the worship of the phallus	2014-05-08	5	0	5
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3KUIPOET15VGG	B B	All the special effects, technological advances and 70+ years of movie making progress and Peter Jackson can't hold a candle to the original.  Someone should have told him he was remaking King Kong - not Mighty Joe Young.  Ann Darrow is not supposed to fall in love with Kong, Kong's supposed to fall in love with her.I could cut about 1 hour out of this movie and make it better, but it would still take a distant back seat to the original.I could go on and on, but suffice to say this was a huge dissappointment.	2.0	Jackson should have watched the original	2006-07-22	8	4	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2KEO5N0SWHKAI	"B. Darrow ""hulkfanatic"""	"It is WAY too long.  I can appreciate that Jackson, along with the spectacular LOTR's tilogy, is a wonderful visionary & knows how to do action to rival Cameron & Speilberg.  HOWEVER, Jackson just tries WAY too hard here.  I loved the atmosphere of when they got to Skull Island in the fog.  Kinda creepy.  But how long did that scene last, 10 minutes?  Just get off the d*** boat already.  They needed maybe 2-3 minutes of mood & then get off the boat.  This isn't Titanic.  Then comes the dinasour stampede which was so obviously fake looking.  Could have saved about 10 minutes  Later we have a bug attack that was a complete waste of film.  Another 5-10 minutes or so cut.  Oh & about the dinasour attacking Ann & King in the vines...a few snaps were cool.  After about 10 I was like, ""ok, this is getting tedious.  Move on.""  There's about 2-3 minutes nixed.  Developing a romance before Ann is captured would also have been nice.  One minute Ann & the screenwriter ar ebickering, th enext minute they're kissing.  If you were gonna need more time make it on a this & not on effects.  The great thing sbaout LOTR's is that it developed the chracters enough so yo cared what happened to them.  Now, I know, peopel will say, ""oh but LOTR's was 3 movies.""  Yes, taht's true, but you can still develop your characters more in a 2-3 hour movie enough to care about them.  It's bad when your lead actress has more chemistry with a CGI gorilla than Adrian Brody.  ""I wrote a play for you.""  WOW, he must love her because of that.  Jack Black is also NOT a serious actor.  He is & will always be a COMIC actor.  Ok, I know Robin Williams does both well, but if Black was gonna be realistic as a serious actor, nix the raised eyebrow thing.  Plus his famous line at the end was said so matter of factly it was like he was reading the line from the script.  I cringed.  I don't fault Jackson, as I said he is one amazing visionary.  I blame the editor for it.  Plus Andy Serkis, well apologes to the actual actor, does another terriffic job as a CGI character.  This Kong spend a lot more time developing the ""relationship"" with Ann & Kong & it did it rather successfully IMO.  Nix the dead pan Jack Black line & I really felt for Kong.  I credit Serkis' facial expressions for that.  But, I cant forget Watts, either.  What was with teh jailer & the criminal, too.  At least in The Green Mile the friendship, or whatever you call it, they had was credible.  I didn't really believe this one for a second.  Again, too much time spent on effects not enough on character development.  Quite entertaining, but overly long."	4.0	Would have recieved 5 stars....but...	2006-02-28	7	2	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1DD4HVOIF30HJ	Beata Bajer	"I just came back from seeing the movie and I am still astounded how great this movie is!! Compared to the original which is a great movie, this one is better by a lot. Now for the story:A frustrated movie director decides to make a desperate attempt at making a hit movie by travelling to Skull Island, a remote, unlocated island ""surrounded by fog"". On the way he picks up Naomi Watts as the new star and Adrien Broody as the screenplay writer. They quickly set sail. After a fierce storm, they are on the island. In the night a bunch of cannibals fly on sticks *you have to see that scene* capture Naomi and set her on a plank to be the sacrifice for their ""god"" Kong. Brody notices her absence, and along with the crew go to find her. Meanwhile, Kong and Naomi start as enemies, but slowly, a beauty and the beast relationship starts to show. Meanwhile Brody and the crew get caught in a dinosaur stamped, attacked by Cockroaches, Large Scorpion Spider Thingies but finally get out and find the girl. They chloroform and capture the poor Kong. There in New York it escapes, runs loose, encounters a spectacular fight on the top of the Empire State Building and falls to his death.This movie was fantastic, no doubt about it. The characters were great, the special effects were amazing, and the whole movie was just astounding.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1NSMQIF1C2VCE	Beau Yarbrough	The truth is, most people thought of King Kong as a joke. Sure, the original, way back when, was apparently scary to audiences. But today, the clumsy little stop-motion gorilla doesn't have the power to do much with current audiences. Certainly not scare them. The campy 1970s remake -- with the very timely energy crisis subplot --  doesn't really do it for today's audiences either.Peter Jackson remembered, though, that Kong used to terrify audiences. Lucky us.The 21st century King Kong not only features an utterly convincing giant gorilla and actual compelling characters and a great Depression-era setting, it also is the scariest dinosaur/giant monster movie to date. The bug scene will send arachnophobes screaming for the door and Kong versus not one, not two, but three tyrannosaurs makes the Jurassic Park series look like a lot of smoke and mirrors. Combined with the best version of Kong's climactic stand-off with the fighter planes, this is easily the best version of the classic story to date.Unfortunately, this all adds up to a long, long movie. It's worth it, but be prepared for at least one intermission along the way.Peter Jackon's King Kong gets my highest possible recommendation for fans of the previous films, the Jurassic Park series, the radiant Naomi Watts, Peter Jackson or giant monster movies in general. Great, thrilling stuff.	5.0	Long, but worth it. Jurrasic Park and all other Kongs are history.	2006-05-21	7	3	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	To be perfectly honest, because I had never watched the original King Kong, or any of the remakes, I went in expecting nothing but a few good action scenes, and a predictable, tacked on story at the very end.  Boy was I wrong.I seriously enjoyed every moment of this film.  Well, *almost* every moment.  I have to agree with popular opinion that the first 45 minutes of the film were pretty long and unnecessary, however, we're talking about a 3 hour movie that honestly didn't disappoint after those beginning 45 minutes were over.  From that point on, the movie pretty much ruled.My favorite part was the dinosaur chase.  It really DID look like the actors were being chased by those deadly dinosaurs.  The fight scenes between King Kong and the dinosaurs was another lengthy dose of nonstop excitement.  You simply couldn't ask for better action.As for the story, well, that was the one thing I was worried about, seeing as how this version of King Kong is the only one I know.  I could have sworn, judging by the black and white pictures I'd seen showing King Kong swinging around from the top of a building, that the story would be entirely overblown and far-fetched.  Once again, I was wrong.  The story honestly didn't disappoint.I believe this movie deserved all the attention it received about a year ago.  It really is good, and it really is believable that a giant ape is chasing a bunch of people around.  I can't believe I actually felt some emotion when King Kong became close with Naomi's character.  Oh, by the way, Naomi Watts is now the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.  The interaction between her and King Kong was totally believable and emotional, and I can't believe I'm saying that!  It really works!Some people will say the movie dragged, and was overlong.  However, what really happened was that Peter Jackson gave us probably the best version of King Kong we will ever see.  I haven't seen any of the previous ones so I can't say I'm entirely sure, but there will NEVER be another remake in the future as good as this one.	5.0	never fear, king kong is here!	2006-12-05	6	3	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A9JLE9BISQFUB	"Benjamin Devey ""Author, screenwriter, songwri..."	Peter Jackson takes the metaphor, if you can bring an unprecedented find to the world for the price of an admission ticket, you've got a spectacular show. And King Kong delivers on the premise in sheer scope, cenematic beauty, and bigger-than life story. The production was phenomenal in almost every way. In one instance, when Kong was sliding autos around the streets of Broadway, like a kid crashing matchbox cars, did the action look like CG creation (something in the sliding ape didn't look convincing). In every other scene, the work was awesome, detailed, and completely credibly produced.Watch for character nuances in the non-speaking CG role of Kong, and you'll see another reason this 3rd-generation remake justifies the hype it got. Kong is a sympathetic character with a soft spot for Ann Darrow. Worth the 3 hours of pure enjoyment.	5.0	Spectacular!	2007-02-26	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A31I3HXMD5H1EL	Benjamin J Burgraff	"When Peter Jackson stood upon the dais at the 2004 Academy Awards ceremony, surrounded by a record-tying 11 Oscars, and spoke of his next project, a 2005 remake of the 1933 classic, ""King Kong"", even some of his most devoted fans were worried. The last attempt to remake the ape epic had been the disastrously campy 1976 'update', which nearly sabotaged Jessica Lange's career at it's very start, and is best remembered today for it's gigantic robotic ape (which never worked properly), and World Trade Center finale (making the film heartbreaking to view, since 9/11).Even the concept of Jackson 'diving' into another 'major' project was unheard of; after all, it had taken Steven Spielberg four years to direct another film after ""Schindler's List"", and three, after ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""Titantic"" director James Cameron hasn't made a 'dramatic' film since he won his 11 Oscars, in 1997. Certainly, it seemed that the diminutive New Zealander was rushing things, and had bitten off far more than he could chew, THIS time! The casting did little to allay fears; while Naomi Watts was an ideal choice, in Fay Wray's signature role of 'Ann Darrow', Jack Black, best known for 'over-the-top' comic portrayals, seemed a strange 'fit' as impresario Carl Denham, and Adrien Brody was, physically, about as far removed from Bruce Cabot's 'Jack Driscoll' as an actor could get. And even with Jackson's mastery of CGI, could his 'Kong' surpass Willis O'Brien's legendary stop-motion creation? Could Peter Jackson even do justice to the 72-year-old film classic, and not fall on his face?The answer is a resounding YES!The new ""King Kong"", at over three hours in length, is about as perfect a 'monster movie' as has ever been made, and is a feast for the senses. While clearly a homage to the original (even referring to Fay Wray, RKO, and producer/director Merian Cooper, in a humorous sequence), it takes what was patently artificial in the earlier film, and gives those moments such a sense of heightened reality that it even leaves modern 'genre' films, like ""Jurassic Park"", looking positively quaint. Compared to Jackson's horrific vision of Skull Island, Spielberg's dinosaur-infested islands are a Disney theme park ride! The 'wrap-around' opening and spectacular climax in 1933 New York City are equally amazing. Letter-perfect, they capture the 'feel' of Depression-era Manhattan to a degree that even films of the period couldn't achieve...and Kong's 'last stand' atop the Empire State Building will be talked about for years to come, as a technical marvel.Best of all, the story itself is actually an improvement over the original, without sacrificing those elements everyone loves. Carl Denham is still the opportunistic huckster embodied earlier by Robert Armstrong, but Jack Black adds elements of Orson Welles and P.T. Barnum to the mix, creating a character you can both love and hate. While Adrien Brody only shares the same name as Bruce Cabot's testosterone-fueled hero (portraying a playwright conned into the adventure), a new character (portrayed by Kyle Chandler), is introduced, Denham's 'leading man', who mouths the infamous 'un-PC' dialog (and is even named 'Bruce').The two leads of the story remain Ann Darrow and Kong, himself...and Naomi Watts and the CGI-created ape (pantomimed by Andy Serkis) are astonishing, together! Eschewing the sexual overtones of both the 1933 and 1976 versions, the pair bond out of loneliness and pain, creating a more 'human' friendship than either earlier ""King Kong"". The sensitivity of the relationship, in the midst of all of the chaos, is the glue that truly holds the film together...and makes the climax a heartbreaking, unforgettable experience. Both performances are certainly Oscar-worthy (quite a feat for a giant ape that doesn't even exist!)Peter Jackson has exceeded even the highest expectations with his vision of ""King Kong"", and while it is likely to only win a few technical Oscars, it is, honestly, a better film than ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (which, great as it was, doesn't stand 'by itself' nearly as well).What will the guy come up with next?"	5.0	"Peter Jackson's ""King Kong""...Yes, It's That GOOD!"	2005-12-16	20	14	6

Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) is out of work due to poor acting during the time of the great depression. The two cross paths just in time to catch the tramp steamer that will carry them to Singapore (yeah right). We are introduced to the other characters in the steamer that do not have a clue to what their future holds. We hear tales of an uncharted island that has a wall built so long ago that no one knows who built it or why.Well done by today's standard. They stuck pretty close to the original plotline and even kept some of the key dialog in this version. Some of the characters may have changed vocations, yet the story still floes smoothly. In come ways it is an improvement over the original. However the reason this film is one hour longer than needed to tell the story is all the mindless fluff filler that made it drag on and on and on. Even the action scenes had so much action that you wanted to scream ""get on with it"" and ""let's get going.""Kong himself did not look that proportioned; when he leaped he looked like the Hulk in a fur suit. And poor Ann looked really blurry when she was being swung around. Some parts of her body took time to catch up with the others.They missed an opportunity in the credits to place the faces of the actors with the names.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2H75HHISUL398	"BigStan ""RegularGuy"""	I loved the first King Kong movie in black & white.  But this movie was for me more enjoyable because of the special effects.  The dinosaur fights were excellent.  I loved the developement with King Kong as having a personality and the interaction between him and the girl.  She even uses her vaudville act on Kong and he pretends to not be ammused but she wins him over eventually.  Black is OK as the promoter of the adventure to find the mysterious island.  He is a bit of a ham and overacts at times but that is his nature.  He acts with the intensity of a Tom Cruise but just doesn't have quite Tom's magnetism.  I would have given the movie 5 stars but they could have cut short the human eating giant insect scene in the chasm.  The scene lasted over ten minutes (or seemed like it) and makes the movie out of reach of most children to enjoy. The old King Kong was accessable to all age groups something lost in this new one.  However I still loved this movie.	4.0	Best King Kong yet	2006-11-15	2	2	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AACLAC61L2YPZ	Biker freak	I won't go into the story, other reviewers have done that to death. But what I will do is echo what others have said about the image, sound and clarity of the HD-DVD version. If you have just purchased a HD-DVD player and HDTV, this is the movie to get. The jungle scenes alone are breathtaking in their clarity, color and sharpness. You can nearly count the raindrops as they are falling from the sky! Where HD-DVD becomes too good is in some of the special effects shots, especially during the stampede. In the conventional DVD, the scene is flat and everything blends well. In the HD-DVD version, the sharpness brings the actors forward from the background, almost 3D-like, and you can distinctly tell they are working with green screen. While this seems to be a complaint, it is really kuddos for HD-DVD, but the reason for the 4 stars. As more directors, editors and SFX houses go to full digital film making, they will also have to invent better ways to create these types of effects.I have also compaired Blu-Ray v HD-DVD and have found that HD-DVD, when created from a true digital master (such as Kong), is far and away the better of the two formats.	4.0	HD-DVD too good?	2007-03-08	24	19	5
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AATD008OTFXT1	Bill Fleck	"Because Peter Jackson is such a fan of KING KONG '33, his 2005 remake is tough to separate from the original.  And because I know the old film very well, it's tough for me, too.To begin with, I feel that Jackson's KONG is too long.  If it were up to me, I would cut about 45 minutes out of it easily.  However, the special effects are (mostly) great, though I feel that JURASSIC PARK (1993) is still better in this regard.I think the effects depicting Kong himself are very well done.  Kong as a character is well conceived here, too, with some silver hair and battle scars.  Given these positives, it's a shame that, for me, a lot of the film doesn't live up to them.*WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!*Jackson opens the film with titles in the '33 style, then does a 1930's montage (Hoovervilles, bread lines, etc.) to educate today's audience about the period; these are flawless recreations, but go on too long for me.  He then introduces Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts--good in the role) as a struggling actress.Filmmaker Carl Denham is later introduced as a ne'er-do-well con-artist in the Orson Welles mold (put six inches and a cheesy moustache on Jack Black--good in the part, BTW--and he'd be a ringer for Welles, c. 1942).  Always on the make, he meets Ann as she contemplates employment at a strip joint, and sets sail on The Venture for parts unknown (Skull Island) before he can be arrested for absconding with studio funds.  Trapped on board is Jack Driscoll (Adrian Brody), in this version a playwright and reluctant Denham partner (Brody is not bad in the part, but I feel he's not given much of a character to work with).The Venture's Captain Englehorn is a 40-ish, shady German; his first-mate is a strapping African-American guy named Hayes, who mentors teen crewmember Jimmy, a troubled youth (I feel that much of this sub-plot could be cut).  Bruce Baxter, a preening male actor, also goes on the voyage.  It's fully 45 minutes before The Venture crashes on the rocks of skull island--after Denham has been educated by Hayes and the English cook Lumpy about its history (in this version, he has the map to the island, but knows nothing of Kong).The natives they find on Skull Island are horrific--pierced, red-eyed, savage--and they kill some of the landing party (Englehorn saves Denham with his Lugar!).  But here, I feel that the logical problems in the film begin--we never see their civilization.  The gigantic wall is a ruin, and where the natives are encountered is a barren wasteland--exactly what is this wall protecting?  These scenes are also filmed like a Sting music video from 1985, I'm guessing to underscore the action; I personally found that to be annoying, but your opinion may differ.Ann is kidnapped by the natives in a way even more illogical than in '33 (a native on a huge pole vault [!] Spidermans his way onto the ship and drags her off), and a terrifying female witchdoctor leads the ceremony sacrificing Ann.  Ann is strapped into what looks like a giant slingshot and is semi-catapulted across a ravine to await Kong.  When the big guy shows up, it's a whole lot like the 1976 Dino DeLaurentis version (not the last allusion Jackson makes to that film).Denham and the boys set out after Kong, though Denham is seen cranking his camera rather than leading the party (at times, I feel this is taken to ridiculous extremes, especially when he's on the log bridge while Kong is shaking it).  The guys (mostly) survive a brontosaurus/raptor stampede (these scenes have a cartoon feel for me, though others might disagree), and the log bridge scene features more creepy bugs than I think would be logically possible (overall, however, it is effective).  Jimmy machine-guns a ton of the slimy critters off Driscoll at close range--ridiculous, in my view.  Miraculously, Englehorn and Baxter arrive just in time (again) to save Denham.In KONG '33, the giant ape's battle with a T-Rex is a highlight (and an inspiration for many filmmakers, including Steven Spielberg).  Because it's the 21st Century now (""been there, done that""), Kong here--Ann in hand--fights three V-Rex's at once, falling off a cliff in the process and battling them in the hanging vines as they Wiley-Coyote their way to the bottom.  These scenes are Nintendo fast, with sweeping camera, and, as such, are both exciting and annoying--I couldn't catch all that was going on (plus, they're so over the top logically that there's no credibility--and that's saying something, considering we're talking about a film featuring a 25-foot ape).  Anyway, Kong finishes the last one off on the ground in '33 style--in my opinion, the best part of the film (here, Jackson tones down the Sly Cooper imagery, allowing for a long shot or two, which helped me orient the action).In a throwback to the '76 version, Ann begins talking with and entertaining Kong (though, unlike the '76 version, there's nothing sexual implied).  These parts are bad in my opinion, and I'd cut them.  Then, Driscoll appears out of nowhere (in '33, we saw him tracking Kong) and--while Kong battles huge bats [!]--the playwright and Ann make their escape by (at first) climbing down a vine, then GRABBING THE FEET OF A BAT and hang-gliding to the river below (this is absolutely the worst thing in the film).Like the Denham character Fred Wilson in '76, Denham risks the lives of everybody to capture Kong.  The natives have strangely disappeared (to where?); it's only what's left of The Venture crew behind the wall.  Kong's rampage once he gets through the gate is good, though illogic strikes again when Englehorn shoots him in the leg with a harpoon gun and cripples him (since Kong's brushed off at least three V-Rex bites FLUSH ON HIS ARMS--which would surely cause more damage--I'm not sure why this harpoon thing threatens him so much).  Ann does the, ""No, don't kill him!"" routine, and tries to get off the lifeboat to protect him (awful).  Denham hits the big guy in the face with a bottle of chloroform, puts him to sleep, does the ""we're millionaires, boys"" speech, and, like '33, we're suddenly in NYC on Broadway.As in the '76 version, Ann and Jack boycott the event (he opens his play off-Broadway, she acts in a review across town).  Denham has Baxter and an un-named actress sub for them.  At this point, Jackson does an interesting homage to Kong '33 by having the on-screen orchestra in the film play a variety of snippets from the original score--which, unfortunately, points up how lacking in drama the score for HIS film is (also, on stage, they recreate the '33 natives and their dance--interesting).Wanting to see Ann, Driscoll shows up at Kong's NY unveiling--and, like in '33, the photographers fire away, enraging Kong.  He escapes (a good scene), gets loose, and throws cars around (okay--but, again, Nintendo).  He's chasing Driscoll in a cab and about to kill him, when Ann appears in the street (her hair highlighted in a halo) and calms him down.  He takes her through ice-covered Central Park (complete with decorated trees for Xmas--did they do that in 1933?), and, in an infamous scene, plays on the ice with her until the army starts firing missiles at him (all of this really should have been cut, in my opinion).  He then climbs the Empire State Building--very effective--and sits up there with Ann as the sun rises (absurd).Six planes arrive with no warning, and Kong goes 'way on top of the building to battle them.  There are some terrific shots here, though Ann--absurdly, like Dwan in KONG '76--tries to stop the planes from killing him (she apparently has NO FEAR of heights, and--in spite of what must be BRUTAL COLD UP THERE--doesn't shiver once in her party dress as she Indiana Jonses from perch to perch).  In some spectacular images, Kong knocks out three of the planes before they get to him, though he has to take time out from the fight to catch Ann when a ladder comes loose from the side of the building (I get the feeling he could have beaten the planes if he didn't have to worry about her).When he finally begins to die, Ann's right on top of the building with him (in high heels, no less), and, as he falters, they stare at each other face to face, sharing a tender goodbye before he slips off (absurd in my view, though most critics don't agree).  Driscoll then appears and hugs her RIGHT ON THE PINNACLE--apparently, this exchange of affection is more important than getting the hell DOWN from there.In Dino style, photographers stand on the dead Kong's chest for photos, Denham delivers the famous beauty-killed-beast line (but since he's been presented as such a con man and liar, I'm not sure why we should consider it to be profound, coming from him), and the film comes to an end.Overall, I found KONG '05 to be slow in spots, 'way overdone in others, and absurd in several.However, there are enough good things in the film to make me glad I saw it.Compared with KONG '33, it's better and it isn't.  Obviously, the effects are far better--though, again, I still feel they're inferior to JURASSIC PARK.  I find KONG '33 to be unintentionally funny in spots--the brontosaurus attack for example (and the jerky stop-motion effects take some getting used-to these days)--but once Kong tangles with the T-Rex, things get good and stay good.  Denham, Ann, and Driscoll all make sense in '33, and I have to give the makers of the original a lot of points for coming up with all of this in the first place.In my view, what Jackson did to Denham in the remake is a crime, and though Ann '33 screamed too much, her ""save-the-animal"" sensibility here seems forced, maudlin, and anachronistic (I have to admit, though, that I have no idea how I'd react if I were a gorgeous blonde plaything for a giant ape).  Too, the story MOVED in '33, and the music underscored the drama (a lot of illogical things weren't obvious because of the pace).  In my opinion, Jackson has bogged the story down with unnecessary characters and motivations, and the musical score is nothing special.Stylistically, however, I think Jackson's KONG is gorgeous, though as I've mentioned, there are annoying (to me) music video/video game sections.  In short, Jackson and company have made a good film.  Had they stuck closer to the '33 script with modern-day effects, I think it would have been great.  But I'll be buying the DVD from Amazon, no doubt."	3.0	Pretty Good Stuff	2006-03-29	6	3	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AL1PNYDIILV4D	Bill Michaels	The best part of the whole film is the ape. Superb special effects bring Kong to life but I didn't need 3 hours to admire it. Mingled in between for what seemed like eternity was a bit lifted right out of Jurassic Park replete with horrible special effects looking like they were from a cheap Japanese Godzilla film years ago (they obviously spent all of the effects budget on the ape). And... someone PLEASE tell Jack Black to take some acting classes. How a marginal talent like this guy lands a gig like this movie is beyond me. Completely mis-cast with that dopey half smirk on his face the whole 3 hours.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3BG5AR5KE6QYG	Bill W	"Peter Jackson is a talented director, but he doesn't seem to know the difference between a roller coaster ride and a film. In this Kong version the special effects have become so ""over charged"" they have overshadowed everything including Kong himself. While the animation is very detailed and true to form. I did find much of the action / motion to fast and seemly lacking the mass of real life. This isn't helped by the fact that many movements are simply to impossible too believed.Small point I personally would have liked more time exploring Skull Island! Less gore(skulls and bones)and dark atmosphere!Fewer numbers and more varieties(i.e.Apatosaurus stampedes and cervase insects).The acting wasn't bad but the writing and characterization are unnerving for lovers of the orginal 1933 KING KONG.Jack Black is miscasted as Carl Denham.I am not fond of the way the natives are depicted as sub-humans.In closing I note the PG13 rating this really isn't a film for young Children.Postscript: I must say I was very pleased with the pseudo-documentaries included on the second disc.  The ""Skull Island a Natural History"" is remarkably well done I personally found it more interesting and entertaining than the Feature. Also I was impressed by Kong's New York 1933 which adds much to the times that Kong is set."	3.0	Dramamine Please....	2006-06-18	10	7	3

Man was I disappointed. First of all the movie started out way to slow. They spent to much time on the boat just trying to get to Skull Island. I gave it 2 stars because once they did make it there the special effects were great. The movie had some good action scenes in it with Kong fighting the T-Rex and when he was in New York on top of the Empire State Building. But the movie just dragged on for an hour to long. There were a lot of scenes that could have been cut or shorten and the viewer would not have lost anything from the story line.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2TAPL67U2A5HM	Bjorn Viberg	King Kong (2-Disc Widescreen Special Edition) is a special effects dream come true.  In fact one could call it a special effects bonanza. The script is well written, the acting is alright for a monster movie, come on it is not like you expect a Shakespeare performance in this kind of movie so the acting does the job with high grades indeed. I love the music, the editing is top rated. The scene with the dinoaurs is very similair from the original 1930's movie. One scene that I miss that he should have replicated is when Fan Wray screams on the boat but Peter Jackson uses very little of the screaming that Wray did in the orinal movie. It is not nearly as good as the original but being a remake it is not a terrible movie and gets the four stars that it rightly deserves. The scene where kong dies absolutely breaks my heart and yes, I cried because it was very emotional and was in fact better then the original movie.  Verily, I can not wait to see the directors cut to see the extra hour or so that will probably be added to this grand monster movie.	4.0	King Kong (2-Disc Widescreen Special Edition)	2006-05-19	4	1	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3GKMQFL05Z79K	blackaciddevil	"I hate to admit it but I was extremely skeptical that it would be any good when I heard that Peter Jackson was making a remake of King Kong. Not that I doubt his ability as a filmmaker, he proved his worth with ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. It's just that 1933 film is a classic beloved by all and, often, revered as the best giant monster flick ever made. I was just skeptical that anything new could be done with Kong to make it fresher than the original. Lo and Behold, Jackson did it. In everyway possible, he offered a fresh approach to the original story and movie. With an all-star cast, this 3 hour epic is one of the best movies I've seen in recent memory. I really enjoyed it. Think of it as one part classic Kong, and one part Jurassic Park with a dash of modern day revisioning and you got a modern day Kong flick worth watching. I'm glad I got the movie.I do have to admit that I am also a fan of the '76 version of King Kong, as well. Even so, I feel Jackson's version is better in many respects. If only people knew who he was when the american version of ""Godzilla"" was being filmed, we would have seen a better film. You know? At any rate, King Kong is a great & exciting movie. Definitely worth getting and adding to your collection."	5.0	"Kong.....""The Eighth Wonder of the World""........."	2006-04-03	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1P7O2PAA8H1DD	Blade329	King Kong is about a 90 minute movie squeezed into over 3 hours.  Talk about taking a relatively simple straightforward plot and extending it beyond all reasonable comprehension.  That's what you get with this.  Everything about this movie is just overly drawn out.  It takes forever just to get started. An overly long wait just to get the main characters to get to the ship.  An overly long trip to Skull Island.  An overly long time just to park the ship for crying out loud.  There are times where Jack Black is just staring at things for an inordinate amount of time.  In one scene, on the island, he's staring at the film in the camera and pondering something.  Even a simple scene like that takes too long. Get the idea?  You don't even get to see King Kong until about 90 minutes into this monstrosity.  Even basic events like the dinosaur stampede are just mind numbing and overplayed. I could have gotten up, gone to the bathroom, gone to the kitchen, picked up some snacks, gone back to the TV and the dinosaurs would have still been crashing into each other.  It's just ridiculous.  I get that Jackson was trying to turn it into an epic, but it just doesn't work.  This isn't Lord of the Rings.  King Kong does not have a following like that.  Making a movie extra long doesn't automatically make it good.  Another problem with the movie is the main characters.  Naomi Watts is fine, but she has zero chemistry with Adrian Brody.  None.  The love story falls flat on it's face.  How can it work anyway when Watt's character obviously favors the giant ape?  Brody's character becomes almost pointless.  This movie was just so long and boring that I almost never finished it.  I finally ended up watching the end almost 3 weeks later.  I cared that little about it. The DVD quality is fine.  You get extended scenes, in case the original wasn't long enough for you.  More scenes of the endless supply of ship crewmen getting massacred by dinosaurs.  There must have been 200+ crewmen on that little ship.  There are tons of extras on the DVD's for those that want to spend a week processing King Kong.	2.0	Overrated and over hyped.	2012-05-25	6	2	4

The following does not discount that, merely points to the most in that statement.Good points:Peter Jackson directed it. Thus it has excellent use of the epic film style.Beautiful actress to play the classic damsel in distress, with a solid acting performance to back it up.For once, excellent serious acting on Jack Black's part.Solid near flawless computer graphics for every scene requiring it.Fantastic musical score that seamlessly fit into every scene.Wonderful lighting.Beautiful scenery.Life-like visuals on the ape's part.So, why 2 stars?Bad points:Should have been broken into three seperate movies, one entitled: ""Before the Island"", second entitled: ""At the Island"", third entitled: ""After the Island"". Each would have been a short, but still close to normal length film.Editing was a serious problem with this film. Given full reign, Peter Jackson seems to not know the meaning of the word: concise. Rambling, repetative, beating the dead horse, chopping the wood after it is already sawdust, these are good analogies for this film. One bug scene was enough, thank you. Two was far past pushing it. Then to have the dinosaur smushing, then the three! T-Rex dinosaur fight with the big ape...and so on.To clarify once more, I saw this in theatres. I finished my drink rather early on, thus at three hours and five minutes I was a little antsy and thought, I'll wait two more minutes, they should be done shooting the big ape then. Two minutes later, nopeallright havetoleave. Five minutes after that, afraid I had missed the end of this long, agonizing movie, I slipped back in the theatre and saw the planes still buzzing the big ape. I realize the creature is massive, but how many large caliber bullets does it take to knock this thing out?!So, there you have it. A possibly wonderful movie, with excellent points all around, brought low by seriously bad editing. Then to find out that they extended it for the DVD!"	2.0	Some good, mostly bad.	2010-06-16	6	3	3

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	`King Kong', the second remake by master fantasy director, Peter Jackson is a major improvement over the first remake (which, however, is not quite as bad as some may have said), but somehow, it does not quite manage to outdo the impact of the original, when you pro-rate the advances in special effects technology against the great impression made by the original.To the good, I must say that unlike so many other movies, the trailer gives just the tip of the iceberg of special effects gee whiz impact. Many scenes which never made it to the trailer are even more impressive than the highlights. Most impressive is the brontosaurus stampede and Kong's fistfight with three T Rexs while swinging from a tangle of vines while simultaneously holding Naomi Watts in his right palm. Even better may be his interpretation of the natives on Skull Island. In the original and in the first remake, the natives seem more like Jackson's recreation of the natives on the Broadway stage than like a true primitive tribe living in the shadow of a collection of bloodthirsty prehistoric monsters. Jackson's version of these feral primitives may be his most creative change to the images created in the original and left largely untouched by the first remake. In fact, all the business between the landing on Skull Island and the contact between Kong and Watts is a major improvement over the first two movies. The set adds a moat between the prehistoric wall and the part of the island where the monsters lived. It also solves the problem of why the natives even bothered to venture into this region beyond the wall even for the short time needed to  place the sacrifice to Kong. It does not, however, solve the problem of what Kong wants with these young female `brides' as he is obviously still a vegetarian.The main question, however, is why the movie did not make a bigger impression in the theatre when it was released late last year, given the enormous prerelease buildup, the cachet of being the remake of one of the most important movie fantasies of all time, and the bump from the 11 Academy Award sweep from `Lord of the Rings, Return of the King' in 2003. There are two easy reasons. First, this is a remake, so most of the credit for the story and most of the images which were invented in the original movie and simply enhanced by Jackson and his crew. Second, this is easily seen as simply a clever action fantasy story, while `Lord of the Rings' involved an epic battle between good and evil, spearheaded not by a crew armed with guns and modern chemicals, but with simple grit and courage. Another possible explanation for its less than expected impact is the fact that the fourth Harry Potter movie and the first installment in Disney's Narnia franchaise came out, which was a truer successor to the `Lord of the Rings' aura than the `King Kong' story.The most common complaint I read about this new `King Kong' is that it was simply too long. I agree with this, adding to it that some of the new scenes on Skull Island, especially those involving some fantastical new creatures and the oversized insects simply do nothing to move the story forward. That the original movie did such a great job of telling its story in about 90 minutes makes one wonder why Jackson couldn't match them scene for scene and be done with it. It is understandable that he wants to be seen as improving on the original, but since he does that in so many demonstrable ways, why draw it out as well.One improvement which works is Naomi Watts' business with Kong on Skull Island and her relation with the big ape in general. This takes some additional time, but not much. Another improvement is the change in Carl Denham's situation before he leaves New York. This change works well with casting Jack Black as Denham. Black fits the scoundrel's role far better than an Indiana Jones hero type actor. While interesting, Jackson's opening miniature feature on the contrast between New York wealth and depression poverty is very well done, but it contributes little to the story. Since we've seen it all before, we don't really need to be reminded of the fact that the story takes place at the height of the depression. I'm almost disappointed Jackson didn't make something of the fact that the Empire State Building was just finished early in the depression years, and the action takes place (maybe) while the building is not even completed.The greatest benefit of the new effects technology, much of it created by Jackson's own effects company for `Lord of the Rings', is the characterization of Kong, done by computer enhancement of a live actor (Andy Serkis, who is best known for being the voice and business behind the Gollum character). This improved one of the few drawbacks of the original primitive effects in that the `claymation' style of animation left its traces on the Kong model fur.While Serkis makes a major improvement in the characterization of Kong, I really had a hard time seeing Watts' performance as an improvement over both Fay Wray AND Jessica Lange, who, at the time of her appearance in King Kong 2, was seen as simply a new dumb blond. I prefer to think that Lange was giving us an excellent performance of a character who was a dumb blond and thereby made a major improvement on Fay Wray's characterization. The improvements in Watts' character are due less to her impromement over Lange or Wray as an actor but in the improved additions to her business by the writers and director.I am really happy that Jackson decided to recreate the original rather than, like the first remake, recast the plot with a different motive for visiting Skull Island. I think he would have done an even better job at cutting back on some of his `improvements' but not on his most basic changes to Denhan's character and motives.This version has few extras, certainly none which substantially improve the experience of viewing the movie.	5.0	A great, if slightly imperfect remake of the classic.	2006-03-30	3	3	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2Y3L6EQZYEUWH	Bob	"Peter Jackson wanted to try to remake King Kong, and it is an exhausting try.  If you wait to see it on Video, you will not have missed anything; the film simply does not work.It has lots of homage's to other films: ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Romancing the Stone,"" ""Dances with Wolves,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" Unfortunately, all these elements conspire - despite technical advancements - to leave the audience wondering if Peter Jackson has anything original to present.O.K., petite blonde starlet learns to love a hairy ape; but so what?  Can their relationship develop into anything meaningful?  Can it be sustained for any length of time?  In the absence of an outside threat, is there anything to hold it together?  Even in the hands of Peter Jackson,  the answer is a resounding ""No"".The only sense in which their relationship works is when Kong is killing something that is threatening her.  Other than that, there relationship is one of stares.  In scene after plodding scene, Jackson has the gorilla and the starlet look longingly in each other's eyes.  Then they look dewy-eyed some more... One is reminded of the Spinal Tap lyric, ""And it feels so real, you can feel the feeling...""  In a clumsy way this is supposed to suggest a meeting of the souls, but this doesn't work.  One no more senses real chemistry here than when Anakin whined to Padme about his sorry life.Then there are the unanswered questions:  Setting aside how incontinent Gorillas can be, how long does the starlet plan to spend living in Kong's hand?  How long does Kong think he can run around with his new toy before he breaks her?  Why does the starlet treat her rescuers so ungratefully in trying to save her from a rotten island that, had she'd known better, she never would have traveled to?Perhaps sensing that many in his audience are not going to fall for this drivel, Jackson tries to shore-up the film with a parallel plot line that is pure video game. Perhaps the movie's tag line should have been, ""Come for the Ape, stay for all the other weird jungle crap.""By the time you reach the end of the third hour, you are just hoping the stupid gorilla will be attacked by the planes, and quickly die so you can get back to your life where things move a little faster.  No such luck.  Instead there are more long stares of longing, and a bunch of improbable heroics.  Some has suggested that the film would work better if edited.  I'm not so sure.  Too many millions of dollars are up there on the screen, and if the dragging scenes were tightened, the effects-heavy subplots would become incomprehensible unless whole sequences were chopped out completely.In the end ""beauty"" doesn't kill the beast; it simply dies of old age, with a tired audience looking on."	2.0	Absurd, But On The Other Hand, Really Long...	2006-01-22	17	7	10
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A108A421PC6MH3	Bob Stout	"Every generation or two, there appears a wunderkind director who changes all the rules. There was Orson Wells, Steven Spielberg, and now there's Peter Jackson.When I first heard that Jackson would follow up the Lord of the Rings trilogy with a remake of King Kong, I was really curious and interested to see what it would be like, but also wondered what he could bring new to the project. As time went by and things leaked out, I rode a roller coaster of anticipation and trepidation. Some of the story changes and casting concerned me.Well, now it's out and I have to say Jackson nailed it! This is a big, long movie with as much heart as special effects. Note that this review ontains  some minor spoilers. Still, there's really very little in this that you might not already know by watching the original and reading some of the press releases put out while this KK was in production.Roger Ebert said that Naomi Watts deserves an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Ann Darrow and I must concur. Just as impressive is Andy Serkis, this time doing Kong instead of Gollum. The movie changes the nature and relationship of the other major characters from both the original and the disappointing 1976 remake. All of the changes make the movie more coherent and better explain why the characters act as they do. What wasn't changed was the time period. This Kong, like the original, takes place in 1933 - a wise decision based on 20/20 hindsight and the 1976 remake. There are even a couple of cute lines and scenes which reference the original movie.The Carl Denham character is probably the most poorly cast, but it still works well. In both of the previous versions, Carl Denham is simply a two dimensional character - a promoter in the original and a corporate villain of the 1976 version. In Jackson's vision, Denham is a promoter, alright, but Jackson doesn't shy away from showing how callous, manipulative, exploitative, and self-serving he is. He is truly the most evil character in the show. In the end, you know it really wasn't beauty that killed the beast, it was Carl Denham. Of course, this was true in the previous versions, but it was never as obvious as it is here. Even his ""It was beauty killed the beast"" line merely highlights the fact that he's so self serving that he really doesn't get it and never will.Ann Darrow isn't an improbably hired off-the-street girl Denham picks to star in his movie, as in the original. Neither is she the bubble-headed actress of the 1976 remake. She's a vaudeville performer who's just lost her job (it does take place in the Great Depression, after all). She aspires to be an actress, but as we first see her has almost sunk to the level of considering a burlesque job. She has feelings and depth. As events play out on Skull Island, she uses her vaudeville skills to divert Kong. After Kong saves her life multiple times, she forms a complex bond with him. She shows him kindness and understanding, and he becomes her protector. As the relationship develops, you see it as typical of the bond that people have with their pets. Only in this case, they're both pets of one another.Jack Driscoll in Jackson's movie is a writer rather than a ship's mate, which makes the developing romance between him and the showgirl Ann Darrow more believable. He's also deliberately not physically the hero type, which makes his heroism all the more impressive.By the time, Denham returns with Kong to NYC, both Ann and Jack have washed their hands of the whole deal. Denham, true to his sleazy personality, reenacts events on the island with some generic blonde he could pay scale to stand in for Ann Darrow. That it's not really Ann doesn't stop Denham from introducing her as Ann, ""the bravest girl I've ever known."" One added character is Bruce Baxter, a matin&eacute;e idol actor and Ann's costar in Denham's film. A hero on screen, he's basically a coward who discovers just enough of a real hero inside him to save the day at a critical moment on the island. Unfortunately, he reverts to his vain, preening self once they return to civilization, taking his place alongside the bogus Ann Darrow as one of the ""heroes"" of the expedition.The rest of the details are vintage Kong, but on steroids. The famous spider pit scene cut from the original is put back in. Instead of a single T.Rex to fight, Kong has three to fight simultaneously with only one hand since the other one holds Ann Darrow. Instead of a few dinosaurs, we get herds of Jurassic Park quality beasts. One delightful scene has Kong playing on the Central Park ice rink with Ann Darrow - one brief playful moment whose spell is broken by artillery fire.This film succeeds on every level it attempts. It's a great action movie, but also a great love story with real heart and a message to convey about the nature of love and loyalty."	5.0	Peter Jackson does it again - the definitive Kong	2005-12-14	6	3	3

They managed to keep you on the edge in many parts while relaxing a little in others. My family actually stayed awake through the whole thing, this is a first in a long time as well. For a new version of a classic it really did the original justice and then some. It could have been easily split into 2 parts but was well worth leaving it as one as well.Even though it's long I'm sure I'll be glad to watch this a few more times, though I'll have to make sure that I only do so on days that I know I will have the 3+ hour to sit around and do nothing.

I've seen alot of remakes that just don't seem to get any better and that usually end up being worse than the original, not kong.  The first quarter or so of the movie is kind of too long for what it's trying to accomplish.  You know what the movie is about, a giant ape, don't spend to much time fleshing out insignificant's.  Unlike Titanic this film fails to keep you interested thru much of the first part.  Some how the movie goes from 0 to 150 in like a few seconds because once the crew hit skull island then the movie takes off.  Action seen after action seen and full use of the digital animation era.  Of course there are flaws in the film, but you have to remember this is a giant ape running lose and forget about them.  The movie left me shaking my head in disbelief at times, like the flailing of the actress (girl shoulda had wiplash).  All and all the movie has enough ""it"" to make it great.

Don't get me wrong--they are two very different projects, but King Kong lacked the heart the trilogy had.When you tell a story in classic form, it's important that your audience cares about your characters...but most of the ""protagonists"" were unlikable--the rest were unrealistic or shallow. The ape himself--in appearance and performance--was awesome, but the rest was just...well, there. The biggest action scene was as mindless as most Jurassic Park sequences. Dinosaur vs. gorilla. Dinosaur and other dinosaur vs. gorilla. This time add obstacle, etc., etc...If you explore this movie hypothetically, you get the real truth: 1) If King Kong had been Jackson's first big movie, people would have wondered why the hell he bothered--his achievement of Lord of the Rings earned him respect...i.e., he must know what he's doing, right? But I'm not so sure, this time...And 2) if you remove the special effects from King Kong, you only have a thread of a story, and very little interesting content.After 3+ hours, I felt nothing."	2.0	Special Effects and not much else...	2005-12-27	14	8	6

I knew eventually we were going to wind up in New York City, but after two hours we were still on the island.  The visuals were good, but the gymnastic abilities of the characters was a bit much. The female lead had more lives than a cat and the characters outrunning a herd of brontosaurus size dinosaurs was pretty hokey too.  They definitely could have shortened the film and made it more tolerable to sit through. King Kong sliding on the ice rink in Central Park was a little much to take as well. I liked the original version made in 1933. Even the 1970's version was better.	3.0	Get me out of this jungle	2006-02-07	19	6	13

Great.  But owning it on DVD, repeat viewings for me are going to be few and far between.First, there's a lot of character development and backdrop that goes nowhere.  The movie takes forever to get going, but you're thinking there must be a reason for all this character introduction.  Well, there isn't really.  It goes nowhere and is completely superfluous.  Beyond that, Anne's affection for the ape is nonsensical.  I think maybe its a veiled attempt to project some late 20th-century environmental/animal protection sensibilities into an era where they make no sense, or perhaps the writers didn't even realize they were doing it.  The 1930s probably had much the same exploitive attitudes as the Victorian era.  The movie also had a darker more foreboding atmosphere than the original, which eventually seemed pointless and gave way to the cartoony NY scenes at the end.  Maybe it was also related to the weak and undeveloped morality-play aspect of the film.  In the middle of all this, Jack Black sticks out like a sore thumb.  I think he was meant to pull off the reassuring confidence of the original Denham character, since he's certainly not a dramatic character, but he falls short and just seems comical where its inappropriate.And CG in general is really tired and is a big turnoff to me.  I almost loathe it.  In this particular movie some CG was okay, and a lot was borderline to just plain bad, which was surprising.  I find older movies that predate CG to be more enjoyable to watch often times, not because the effects are more believable (although in a sense they are because you know you're still seeing a real ""thing"" on screen), but because they had to be more creative and work within limitations and were also more constrained to simpler ""within-the-realm-of-possibilities"" type scenes.  Now instead you get some fat nerd on a workstation somewhere going berserk with the unlimited use of models and crashing and explosions and noise and digitally-created indistinct ""crap"" flying everywhere in some scenes. Gimme O'Brian, Harryhausen, and even Lucas' 70s puppets any day.  I hate watching a CG action scene where you can't keep track of what's going on because its just tons of flip-flopping stuff flying and crashing everywhere action.  To be asked to believe the absurd aerial acrobatics the characters are routinely flung through like rag dolls, escaping unscathed, begs incredulity.  A more recent example is the disorienting urban fight scene in Transformers, an otherwise superior movie.  Get real.  Note to Hollywood: less is more.  Concentrate on story and characters (and have a point to each), use limited effects to enhance -- not bowl over.  But given that those of non-discriminating tastes eat this stuff up, I don't expect any changes any time soon."	2.0	The world would have gotten along fine without this version	2007-11-19	4	2	2

He is forever arching his eyebrows and bugging his eyes, foreshadowing the evil about to hit. I'm not sure that was the intention. It makes this third version of Kong the most hokey by far. Also, the movie is a real drag until Skull Island, and that's about 45 minutes in, way too long to wait for the action to start. Most of the movie looks like digital special effects.

Jack Black is atrocious- moving your eyebrows a lot is not good acting, in case he didn't know.The sort of pederastic relationship between Jimmy and his big friend was weird and absurd.The writing... an insult to anyone's intelligence.If special effects could make a movie, I would give it five stars, but it can't, so I won't.

I've watched the original many times, and although there is an obvious obsession in Kong for Ann Darrow, it appears to be one way. Everyone in the original seems to pretty much regard Kong as a monster to be feared, battled, or exploited. In the 30s, and long afterward, sentiment towards the preservation of irreplaceable creatures had not developed much, if at all.In Jackson's version, I highly enjoyed the relaxed intro in New York. I was dazzled by every sequence on the island, and felt the full effect of the emotional hammer he brought down on us for the ending sequences.This movie is absolutely true to the spirit of the original, showing an unusual reverence in a remake for its predecessor. If you liked the original Kong, and especially if you first saw it as a child, you will love this one.There is no need to over analyze this movie. It was not made for depth of art, although that is not ignored in the film. It was made as a flat out ""watch me and enjoy"", with a bit of ""try to keep your jaw up"" thrown in.Just as an afterthought, to dispute a few other posts I have read, Jack Black was great in this film, and COMPLETELY on top of his role. Although the character itself is undeniably shallow, Black's depth of performance is far superior to either Robert Armstrong in the original, or Charles Grodin's in the '76 release.I now own both the extended DVD and the blu ray releases of this film. Both are excellent presentations for their format in regard to both video and audio quality."	5.0	If only Merian Cooper were still alive	2007-12-05	1	1	0

In this case however the hype for King Kong never really drew me in to seeing it. Being a huge LOTR fan I started watching this film expecting Peter Jackson to present me with a Epic that had a strong cast with emotional and spine chilling moments.What I got was 3 hours of subpar acting and some of the cheesiest camera angles and shots I have ever seen on film. For example:The overuse of the "" Saving Private Ryan"" invading Normandy beach slowed down shot every time they showed a skull.The HORRIBLE scene where Adrian Brody's character slowly types in the words ""Skull Island"" into his typewriter and you hear him Slowly saying  S.....K......U......L.....L.....etc etc. It is cringe worthy.The CGI is laughable, the dinosaurs are horribly done and Kong is nothing to freak out about. I am still trying to figuire out how this film won an oscar for special effects. Most scenes in this film are either over done or just not polished enough. The native scenes are ridiculously slow and boring and the scene where they fall into the pit of bugs gets old after 30 seconds. They do not spend enough time developing characters but expect you to care when they perish, the boy on the ship is a unnecessary character that goes absolutely no where.This film tries very hard but does not deliver in any of the aspects I was hoping it to. Kong is never presented as a MONSTER that he should be presented as in the beginning. It is overall a goofy film that tried to be deep and be 3 hours long whenin reality this film should have been no longer than 2 hours.At the very most this is a rental and should not be approached expecting a timeless classic. This film will be forgotten in 10 years.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2H5H625C57NF8	"Brian Kazmarck ""Virtual Mortality"""	"King Kong is a splendid motion picture.  It has the scope and spectacle of films like Titanic and Jurassic Park, yet has the intimacy of any low-budget character drama packed into a grand film.  It's the full package.  Naomi Watts is the emotional anchor of the film.  She does a magnificent job forming a relationship with a the giant ape.  Andy Serkis's movements were used to create Kong's movements, as he did with Gollum in Lord of the Rings.  Adrien Brody serves the story well as Jack Driscoll.  My own personal delight was seeing Jack Black in a roll that wasn't comedic.  Sure, he has his ""Jack Black moments"" in this film, but, I like it when a typecasted actor departs from the norm and does something different, even if it may or may not challenge is acting skills.The technical virtues of this film can not be described with words.  These special effects, sets, makeup, costumes, etc. are undeniably some of the best ever put on screen.  Peter Jackson's technical department deserves all praise and honor for their efforts.There have been some complaints about the film's pace and length.  I would tend to agree that there are a few minor quibbles about the length of the film.  Simply put, it could have been shorter.  The script seems to go into avenues it never fully finishes.  There are characters in the film, whom we share intimate, personal moments with, and then there is no follow-up to their characters.  There is no story arc to their existence.  They are developed, then eaten for dinosaurs, killed by natives, or simply forgotten.  Why spend the time developing certain characters if there isn't going to be any follow up to begin with?  And while we're on the subject of characters, it's in the third act that the principal characters begin to sink into obscurity.  Jack Driscoll is integral to the first two acts, but, in the last fifteen minutes, his presence becomes hollow.  He has one heroic moment when Kong is rampaging through New York, and then he is virtually forgotten.  And what happened to Ann Darrow?  She barely says anything, nor does she show as much emotion as when she did on Skull Island?  It's only Carl Denham's character, to me at least, that comes full circle.  But, in all these, it needs to be said that this King Kong has a personality and a heart, and we certainly feel that tear when he falls off the Empre State Building.King Kong is grand filmmaking.  I loved the film.  Truthfully, I'd give it 4 and a half stars, not five, because of the aforementioned flaws.  Still, I loved it.  I felt like was watching another Titanic of Jurassic Park.  Something we've all seen before, but, it's done in such a way that it still captures our imaginations, and we know we won't see a grand epic like this for another few years."	4.0	Going Ape For King Kong	2006-02-27	5	2	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A14OKJXPQ7F7GB	Bri	In the midst of the Great Depression, Carl Denham ( Black ) is hard-up for an actress for his newest picture. Enter Ann Darrow ( Watts ), a wide-eyed ingenue starving for a role and a meal. Denham convinces her to set sail with his crew to Singapore, for the role of a lifetime. Unknown to the cast and crew, the real destination of their vessel is far from Singapore. Along for the ride are Bruce Baxter, an insufferable pompous actor, and Jack Driscoll ( Brody ), brooding playwright extraordinaire and the object of Ann's affection. Once they reach the filming location, they soon realize that an ill-fated movie is the least of their problems.I absolutely loved this movie. I consider it a classic, right alongside the original. Peter Jackson is one of the best directors out there, and you can tell his love of film in the way he has preserved the suspense and mystery in the legend of Kong. The opening alone sold me. Jackson didn't dive right into the action, but let you into the cold and fledging world of Darrow, so you felt for her every hardship. A lot of the dialogue is the same as the original, and the insect sequence, which was missing from the 1933 version due to budget cuts, is there, in all its squeamish glory. The casting is terrific, especially Watts, who although she must spend the entire movie screaming, gives it her all in every pout. Also worth noting is Jack Black, who proves himself able to do more than slapstick, in the role of a overconfident and overambitious director. But the true star of the movie is Kong, a behemoth of a gorilla, who stirs a multitude of emotion in the audience, with nothing more than a single growl.	3.0	A wonder of 2005	2005-12-16	8	3	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3EW2L59UBHQSG	Bruce Aguilar	I had many reservations about King Kong before seeing it and unfortunately they were mostly all confirmed.  Peter Jackson doesn't add anything to the story besides a lot of CGI running and fighting.  It got to the point where I was just waiting for the CGI mania on Skull Island to end so that the story could continue.  On top of that the CGI compositing was very noticable in a few places, something that just does not pass muster in this day and age.The story starts off well in NYC and I was totally hooked until the cast boarded the ship and headed out to Skull Island.  The acting is fairly well through out with no one particularly standing out.  Sadly, the story is bogged down by unbelievable occurances (even for a story as outlandish as this).  A deserted Central Park and NYC streets without a single person walking by.This version of King Kong adds othing to the story or  characters except about an extra hour or so of running time.  If you like non-stop CGI creatures and effects, this will probably please you, but for those looking for a bit more substance, you should just rent the original film where Kong is actually sympathetic and you care for him.	3.0	Nothing New Here	2005-12-29	7	2	5

But Hollywood can do special effects - that's one of its few strengths - so every generation of film makers needs a chance to show off their updated software skills. Hence, King Kong 2005 is a natural, super-sized with all the special effects that were a real challenge to make credible in the earlier versions. And this new one has been PETA-sized, with an added component: not only can a giant dark ape fall in love with a beautiful blond white woman, but a beautiful blond white woman can fall in love with a giant dark ape. A marriage made in - well, Skull Island. Hence, the underlying imperialist theme is dulled a little (but only a little), and we're left with a 3-hour homage to achronological monsters, animal rights, and the true nature of love. Standing over the defeated Kong's limp, crushed body just toppled from the great monument to civilization, Jack Black (stupidly) concludes: beauty killed the beast.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AODKUG6FAKD2Z	"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books"""	"It will be interesting to see if this is the film for Blu-Ray that the industry hoped ""The Dark Knight"" would be - the one that will make those who are still on the fence about purchasing a Blu-Ray player run out and buy, buy, buy.  The way things are right now, I doubt any movie is going to give that kind of jolt, but if it's possible, ""King Kong"" might be the one to do it.First, I'd like to comment on all the questions about which versions are contained on the disc.  The copy I received (from Amazon - pre-ordered and shipped on 21 January) had a sticker on the outside packaging that plainly stated both versions were on the disc (Both extended and theatrical).  Plus, as soon as the disc loaded, a screen came on allowing the viewer to highlight which version they'd like to watch.  Not wanting to miss a thing, we watched the extended cut the first time out, but I'm sure that when we watch it again, it'll be the theatrical version.  This is a loooong movie.  By the time it was ending, I could tell the kids were almost about to lose interest.Just a quick note about family viewing: This movie is rated PG-13 for a good reason.  It is extremely intense at times, and there are several scenes where people are killed.  The scenes aren't horrifically graphic, thankfully, but the manner in which many of them are killed are certainly horrific.  I did preview this movie before I let the young'uns watch, but I started second guessing myself about half way through.  If you have sensitive viewers, I would definitely recommend previewing it before unleashing it on them.  It's certainly intense.  I decided that for us, this one was ok, but I still won't let them watch ""The Dark Knight"".Now, a word about the Blu-Ray - Fantastic.  Unbelievable.  It's hard for me to envision how a picture could look any better, but that's what everybody thought when regular DVD's first came out.  We watched it using aSamsung BD-P2500 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player, and had absolutely no trouble viewing it at all.  The only problem we did have was while watching the extended cut, there was a 'bonus view' icon in the top left hand corner.  I could not figure out how to get rid of the icon.  Once the film was over, I started it over in the theatrical mode, and the icon was gone.  I'm guessing that this is an operator malfunction instead of a disc problem.  I hope so anyway - I'd hate to think someone did that on purpose.The 'U-control' feature allows the viewer to enable other interactive features while viewing, but we didn't explore that area at all, and frankly, I'm not likely to.  The 'bonus view' that I mentioned before, once enabled, will bring up a PIP screen during play and show some behind the scenes footage concurrently with the film, but once again, we were really only interested in the movie.  I mention these things just for those who might care.There are over a thousand reviews for the regular DVD release of this film, so I wanted to concentrate on the Blu-Ray portion as much as possible.  I will say that this is a very entertaining film - maybe not brain candy - but exciting and enjoyable in a blockbuster sort of way.  It does not condescend or patronize, and a few silly moment aside (and what's a silly moment or two in a movie about a 25 foot tall ape between friends, anyway?), I'd recommend this to anyone that I thought could handle the intensity.  Terrific effects, and regardless of their status, relatively unobtrusive acting.  I'd call it a 4.5, but the darn thing's more fun than a barrel full of monkeys, so I'm rounding up."	5.0	A Beastly good time	2009-01-28	6	5	1

Jackson may have outdone himself on this one from what he did on Lord of the Rings.A young seventeen year-old I work with told me when she watched King Kong at the movies she cried at the end. I thought she was crazy. I even asked if she understood that I said I was thinking about buying King Kong. I thought she must have misunderstood what movie I was talking about. She said the ape was so real. Again, I thought she meant real from the standpoint of special effects. Nope. That's not what she was talking about.There is a line in the film that reoccurs: ""they're only words"". First time I saw the movie I caught on to the fact that they were repeated. I did not understand their impact until watching the film for the second time. Heinrich Zimmer said those things that are most important can never be put to words. Well, in this movie, the most important and emotional scenes have no words whatsoever. Tears and laughter, but, no words. They occur between Ann Darrow and Kong. I do not believe it is by chance that Peter Jackson never had Ann Darrow mention Kong's name in the film. It puzzled me while watching the movie why she never referred to the ape by name. The natives called him Kong. The film director, Carl Denhem, referred to him as Kong. But, Ann never says his name.The humanity with which Kong is imbued in this movie is absolutely astounding. Who but a Peter Jackson whould ever be proud enough to lend such subtle and human traits to a computer animated being? Who but a Peter Jackson could actually succeed in making something so delicate work? After watching this movie twice, I now know why my young friend cried at the end. Kong is used as a metaphor of human traits that are lost as we become adults. I am not speaking of a childlike quality. I am speaking of a transcendent, primordial innocence that we as a species lost thousands of years ago. That wild innocence is seen in Kong and his relationship to Beauty, Ann Darrow. The one word that Kong pantomines to Ann is just that word: ""beauty"". And, in his completely innocent love for Ann, we see a transcendent nature we as humans strive all our lives to regain.King Kong lends itself to many psychological interpretations because it deals with pure archetypes. Kong is the animal within us all that has been so tamed we have lost an important part of our humanity. Ann Darrow, the Beauty to Kong's Beast, is a representation of all that is worth fighting for in life, all that means something. Again, I feel it is no accident that Ann's gown in the final scenes is pure white, constrasted to Kong's blackness. Just before they meet up for the last time the soundtrack has Peggy Lee singing ""Bye Bye Blackbird."" In Ann and Kong we have the perfect Ying and Yang, the pure blending of the pairs of opposites. And while the iconic line that Beauty killed the Beast is in this update of the story as it was in the original, Man is the real instrument used in killing Kong. And, through what part of Man's accomplishments is the Beast killed? - that proudest achievement of our industrial history: the airplane. Man as Machine. And, even in the almost last scene of the movie is another psychological theme produced. Once Kong slips off the Empire State Building in death, Ann rushes into the arms of her Knight in Shining Armour, Jack Driscoll. Kong becomes the Father-figure that must be killed before the innocent child can become a woman and take unto herself a husband. Pure Freud.Yes, the special effects in this film are even more spectacular than what Jackson did in The Trilogy of the Rings. The fight scenes are incredible. But, proving that he is more than just a film technician, through the elemental aspects of this story, Jackson proves he is the most intelligent director doing mainstream movies today. I have to admit it: The Lord of the Rings was no fluke. This man and the people he surrounds himself with are the most talented film makers making films today. King Kong is an instant classic in anybody's book."	5.0	The Monkey Breaks Your Heart	2006-05-29	8	3	5

The dinosaurs also look fabulous; [SPOILER ALERT when King King cracks one of their jaw's... wow]. Besides the visuals, the movie also has heart. Jack Black is not his usual self. He really does a terrific job of playing a driven movie producer. Naomi Watts is a wonderfully modern damsel in distress. The story is well adapted, and it works. There are so many fabulous contrasts (1930s depression juxtaposed to New York entertainment's high society, the horribly terrifying King juxtaposed to the captivating femininity of Naomi Watts, etc).

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	Very well done, but from Peter Jackson the maker of Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't expect less. Excellent production values and good acting make this well worth seeing. Overall I was very impressed with the movie. Now let me tell you a couple reasons why I didn't give it five stars. I took off one star for the following reasons. It is too long. Not everyone wants to sit through a three hour movie. All my family felt it was to long. Sorry, but Jackson could have cut some of the New York scenes out or a few other spots to make this about two hours or just over and it would have been incredibly good still. I think the natives were a bit overdone as cannibalistic zombies and overall I don't have the desire to sit right back down and watch it again as I did with the LOTR movies. Unlike the LOTR movies some of the time in King Kong dragged a little. Don't get me wrong it is well done and certainly in competition with the original and far above the other remake. I think a little less of head bashing natives and so many New York scenes would have made it better. What happened to them in boats and chased by the dinosaur in the water? And as one other reviewer mentioned Kong fighting three T-Rex was overdone. You saw Jurassic Park, the T-Rex didn't travel in packs, that was Velociraptors. Sure I liked the stampede scene too, and the spiders put back in, but they overdid the number of bugs and shooting them off. I still bought it and I am glad I did as I will certainly go back and watch it in a couple weeks or so, just not tonight. So those of you that love it blindly give me some credit for not being all glassy eyed over it, and those that think it stunk give me some credit for being objective about it. Those of you that vote negative at my review because you disagree are obviously not movie critics but just fans, and that doesn't help someone improve their work. I'll take constructive criticism any day over unfounded praise.	4.0	Kong Kong	2006-03-29	5	1	4

What was produced was a movie that actually increased my appreciation of the 1976 version.  When it starts out in New York it is really slow, slow, without anything really required, most of it could have been cut out.  Then on the island it gets ridiculous, as they get involved with stampeding dinosaurs tumbling down the cliff, and swinging Tyrannosaurs; everything that should have been so much better than the SFX-scarce 76 version was orchestrated so poorly and with so little inspiration, that you start wondering how much longer it can go on.  Finally they return to more silliness back in New York, with the ape himself sliding on the ice with the girl.  Apart from the problem of making Kong merely a scaled-up silverback gorilla, who shows all the subtlety and charm of a...gorilla, you can't wait for pilots to get on with it and kill the poor thing so the movie will end.  Long, long, and nothing of note.  Who could have believed that this would be such a lousy film.  Perhaps to be loved only by great Kong fans who want to believe this is a treasure.  A great testament to the all the problems with Hollywood films today.	1.0	One of the biggest disappointments of the decade.	2007-08-20	15	7	8
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AOXC7HI3O8JWI	"Carlo San Juan ""Caz MD"""	"I was one of those people who thought King Kong was a mistake for director Peter Jackson.  Fresh from his monumental success and Academy Awards with his work on The Lord of the Rings, I wasn't confident that he would make an equally, much less surpassively, good film.  I was proven wrong.Running at a horrendously intimidating 187 minutes, I had my fears that there would be parts where cinematographic drags would consume my interest in the film, especially since there were several such moments in Fellowship of the Ring which Jackson also directed.  However, I was pleased to find that dragging moments were limited and the whopping runtime was put to good use... so take care of your bladders prior to watching.I have heard many complaints regarding the first third of the film which takes place in depression-era New York city.  It is in this third where the titular beast is nowhere to be seen, but we are introduced to all the other main characters.  I have argued many times that a film is not without it's characters and so far in his blockbuster career, Peter Jackson has not disappointed in characterization.  It keeps the audience in the hearts and minds of everything that happens onscreen and therefore maintains an engaging atmosphere.  All in all, you care about all the fuss and you watch and wait, with interest, for the next scene to unfold.  Therefore, in spite of the gargantuan runtime, I was riveted to the screen.Carl Denham (Jack Black... yes, Jack Black) is a struggling filmmaker whose career has been so far almost successful.  When he learns his latest film is about to be scrapped, he escapes with his film and crew to continue production.  He then learns his lead actress has quit and runs into an out-of-luck vaudeville entertainer, Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), who he manages to recruit.  He convinces his cast and ship crew that they will be heading for Singapore to film.  In reality, he is heading for the mysterious Skull Island whose location he had acquired just as mysteriously.  However, his production woes continue as his script is unfinished.  He then takes popular theater writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) to continue the script while the ship sails for Skull Island.  Upon reaching the island, they encounter murderous natives who wish to offer Ann to the gigantic beast they worship, Kong.George Lucas once said that special effects are there to aid the telling of a story and should not be the emphasis of a film.  Whether or not Lucas himself adheres to this philosophy is debatable, but it is clear that Jackson does.  There is not one scene, real or digitally created, in this movie that does not have meaning.  There is the scene of a shared sunset between Ann and Kong with volumes of depth.  It is this scene, to this reviewer, that escalated the film from ordinary blockbuster to movie greatness.Yes, there have been previous King Kong films.  But where they fail is where Peter Jackson's take shines.  There is an actual relationship between Kong and Ann, we actually understand why Ann cares so much for him.  While Kong would try to impress her with roars and beating his chest, Ann would perform her vaudeville antics (to Kong's.. and ultimately the audience's delight).  It is their shared moments of joy that solidify an unusual bond of friendship between Ann and Kong.  Ann perhaps realizes that she is Kong's only friend, and hence his entire world.It is the relationship between Ann and Kong that Jackson decided to concentrate his full filmmaking abilities and rightfully so.  Yes, there is another sort-of love story between Ann and Jack Driscoll but not one that would outshine the focus of the film.As for the other actors, they were top-notch.  I have heard others say Jack Black was frightfully miscast but I think otherwise.  His over-the-top acting fits perfectly for Carl, a filmmaker with so much passion for his film that he continually tries to sell it to everyone just so they ""get it"".King Kong, I would have to say, is one of the best films of the year.  Entirely engaging and a delightful and sometimes frightening adventure, it is one with definite heart.  From vaudeville opening to heart-wrenching denoument, Jackson has made a film that beats on it's chest and roars."	5.0	A movie that beats on it's chest and roars!	2006-01-16	377	312	65
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3KXRZCN90F9BB	"Carlos ""Carlos Says Relax"""	Peter Jackson is a man who has done some other excellent movies, and this one is definitely not the exception. But I agree with other reviewer here who said that it was too long. I think that too. Probably cutting the beginning a little it would have been about 20 or 30 minutes shorter, but whatever, that's not the most important.To begin with, the main actors are very good, and they play their roles perfectly. Naomi Watts really broke our heart when she saw King Kong while he was attacked, Jack Black also does a great performance, even though at one point I wanted him to be dead (for the story), and Adrien Brody has always been a terrifir actor who can play any character you tell him to. So, the acting: 10/10.The special effects are quite great too, King Kong looks excellent in the movie, and it looks very real, but its face just changes a bit in some scenes. But the effects look real, but in one or two scenes they do look fake too... 8/10.The story is very interesting too, but the beginning is kind of slow, and if they would have edited it a little more, the movie would have been shorter and better. The rest of the movie is great, sometimes you think one thing, and the next minute you think this other thing, so it's not a predictable movie (off the record: and I like that, because I hate predictable movies!!)The thing I didn't like as much as the rest is the ending. It's very sad, and first I thought they would just send King Kong back to the island, but they didn't, and the way the movie ended was sad and upsetting (for me), because finally the people who had captured King Kong are just free and they don't pay anything. I thought King Kong would kill him, but....whatever, I already saw the movie and it didn't happen. So, story and ending: 9/10.Everything else, like music, lightening and other stuff (specially music): 20/10.When this movie came out, a lot of people told me that it was awful, boring and extremely long, and that I shouldn't watch it...Thank God I didn't listen to them, and I don't regret. But I rented this movie on DVD, and I can't deny that if I had been in the movie theatre for three hours, probably this would be a 1-star rating. I have to be honest about that.Well, judge yourselves. I was expecting for something regular, but I got something incredible!	5.0	Long, with sad ending , but truly fantastic!	2006-06-11	15	11	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2NX3F54RTHSQR	"Carlos Moreno ""Hunter"""	I was always a fan of King Kong, I have both versions on my collection the 1933 and 1976.  After I saw the new version, I'm convinced this is the best version ever.  Full of magnificent visual effects, very convincing.  I don't understand the complains some pleople have about the dinosaurs scenes.  The original version (1933) had dinosaurs too, in comparison with the new ones, the originals are very weak and even then I found them very cheesy.  The new dino scenes are magnificent full of action and adrenaline, very convincing and they add a lot more to the plot, than simply action.  They make you comprehend that this is an isolated island were prehistoric life was preserved in all its essence.  This new version has more thought put into it.  The new version did not include the pterosaurs the original had.  Pterosaurs migrate like birds do today, even though the island was isolated, they could fly and find humans in some other places.  It was very smart to change them for bats.  At least some bats do not migrate.  In general the movie is excellent and interesting, there had been longer boring movies that had even won an oscar, so I don't find any problem with the lenght of this movie.  The only complain I have was the first 45 minutes of the movie that try to develope the characters of the story.  This sequences lack of interest once in a while and do not add anything to the plot, maybe some editing here could've lessen the bad scoring some people did.  Even though, I watched 3 times this movie and came to my house and watched again and again the original and the 1976 versions and now I can say for the first time that the remake of a movie improved upon the original version.

Personally I liked her best when she conveyed more meaning with body language than the spoken word (like in her dialogue-free scenes in the end in NYC). Adrian Brody is not well cast at all as Jack Driscoll (now a playwright rather than first mate as he was in the original to give the new film a more showbiz feel).

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3M5UGU0NGD38D	Casey62	"With any remake, comparisons to the original are inevitable, especially if the original happens to be a beloved classic generally regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. Basically, another remake of KING KONG is unnecessary. To its credit, the campy 1976 version didn't try to ""ape"" the 1933 film, but totally updated the story to its own era. While the latest rehash was intended as an ""homage"" to the original, it can't even stand on its own as an example of good filmmaking.To start with, Peter Jackson's KING KONG did nothing new for movies so it won't be remembered as anything extraordinary 75 years from now. In order for that to happen, a film needs to stand out as different from others of its time and thus be worth talking about long after it came out. The original KONG accomplished this by setting new filmmaking standards in special effects, music scoring and sound recording. Everything comes together so seamlessly in the film that its merits can easily be taken for granted, and often are. KING KONG had huge relevance when it came out in 1933; Aside from revolutionizing the film industry, it depicted the Great Depression, something audiences identified with so strongly at the time, and it immortalized the Empire State Building, which was just erected in 1931 and hailed as the epitome of modern engineering and construction. In short, the film was made exactly when it would best have an impact in the world. Peter Jackson's remake will never achieve that kind of cultural significance because it's irrelevant from the outset. It doesn't speak for its time the way the original did and still does.Greatness is largely measured by originality, and on that note Jackson's film is nothing more than a plagiarism of Merian C. Cooper's original concept. At least in the '76 Dino DeLaurentiis version there were no cheap rip-offs of dialogue and musical cues lifted from the original. This kind of borrowing/referring is lost on younger  audiences unfamiliar with the original film, and only comes off as gushy overindulgence on Jackson's part.I also got jaded very fast with all the repetitious CGI glitz I was bombarded with - Kong flies and bounces around with the speed and weightlesness of a Loony Tunes cartoon character. On the other hand, I never fail to marvel at the grittier, hands on visual effects of 1933 which combined stop-motion, glass paintings, full-scale and miniature rear projection, in-camera mattes, and optical printing. The overall results seem even more remarkable today, especially since that brand of genuine artistry has been replaced by generic, computer simulated effects. Jackson's Kong stretches his mouth too wide when he roars (a lousy roar by the way), and his face and body contort in that watery, exaggerated fashion that is characteristic of CGI in so many current films. It reminded me of the ""rubber hose"" style animation of old cartoons which I don't mind, and even like - in a cartoon that is. Here, instead of looking realistic it only comes off elastic. To say that the CGI is overdone in this digital blitz is putting it mildly; it goes beyond credibility because it's used to depict action that defies physical laws. Despite the way she's being swung and hurled around, Ann Darrow seems to possess the invulnerability of a superhero in a video game.The other neat thing about the first film is that its story, clocking in at 100 minutes, is fool-proof at that running time; extend it to over three hours as Jackson did and it just doesn't work. It's the kind of story that should move briskly along without resorting to scene overkill, and Jackson just crosses that line way too often. Witness the excessive dinosaur fights, the senseless bug scenes, that ridiculous ice skating bit (a real eye roller - Kong turns into Bambi!), and the ponderous, outrageously over the top Empire State Building finale. For all its pretentions toward ""character development"" and other contrivances, this remake manages to omit two of the original's key exciting sequences: Kong's rampage in the native village (what happened to Jackson's demonic looking natives anyway?) and his wrecking of the elevated train. The compromised result doesn't improve on the original, but emerges instead as a tedious, gluttonous opus with a juvenile reliance on sheer banality that tries to pass for ""emotional depth"". Yeah, right.Additionally, though it's set in the '30's, the remake is too self conscious and tries too hard to be politically correct, all of which is out of historical context with that era. If Jackson has issues with the way people behaved in the '30's then why did he set his film in that time when he's unwilling to portray it truthfully? His remake dilutes everything that gave the real 1933 KONG its honest, timeless charm.As for the actors, they're no match for the original players who brought a classic quintessence (not the often misused term ""stereotype"") to their roles. Naomi Watts doesn't look, act, nor scream (yes, the screaming's important too folks) as good as the innocent/sexy Fay Wray. Unlike Wray's iconic, stylized performance, Watts brings none of that larger than life quality, and her face is frozen in a stunned expression for most of the film. She's also a full ten years older than Wray was in her portrayal as Ann Darrow, who's supposed to be an ingenue. This part immortalized the original actress, whereas Watts, like Jessica Lange before her, is probably trying to live it down. The miscast Jack Black totally lacks the conviction and gusto with which Robert Armstrong imbued Carl Denham. Forget the forced Orson Welles allusions; Black's Denham doesn't even measure up to Ed Wood. The actor's throw-away dialogue delivery and smug, immature attitude dispels any credibility to his performance which can best be summed up as amateurish. In his ill-advisedly re-written role as Jack Driscoll, Adrien Brody looks bored and quite unsure of what's expected of him, walking through it all as though he'd rather be doing another movie. Jeff Bridges at least tried to be convincing in the '76 version. In the original, Bruce Cabot played the part as it was called for - a tough, true to the era seaman who, like his rival Kong, is gradually softened by falling for Fay Wray. Kong himself isn't the hybrid, monster-ape as originally conceived in '33, but simply an actual, ho-hum gorilla. He also comes off as an unlikable grouch who isn't as gentle with Ann Darrow as the original Kong is.The one ""performer"" that's really showing off in this movie is Jackson's hyper-active camera, which is constantly gliding, swooping, and circling around like it's mounted on a carousel. It's all supposed to heighten drama and generate excitement - it doesn't. Like the relentless CGI, the camera acrobatics are so overwrought that they ultimately become meaningless, failing to achieve whatever effect the filmmakers intended.Whereas the original KONG tells its story with vivid, no-nonsense clarity, Jackson's is convoluted with trivial subplots and secondary characters whom we don't need nor care to know about. All of that irrelevant elaboration only gets in the way of the narrative's main thrust.A major climax is also mishandled: In the original theater sequence, Kong believes the photographers' flashes are hurting Ann, and this provides excellent motivation for him to break loose - the beast protecting his beauty. It sets up Kong's re-capture of Ann since he follows her out of the theater and sees her run into a hotel. In Jackson's version Ann Darrow isn't even at the theater (though her name appears on the marquee - go figure); instead she's substituted onstage by a stand-in who's participating in a mock native ceremony! Kong's motivation to escape is therefore not brought on by any feeling for Ann - he's just fed up in general. The sequence is further marred by cutting away from  the theater and diverting our attention to some corny dribble about Ann's and Jack's personal problems. It interrupts the tension that should be mounting at this point in the film.Most importantly, Jackson made a crucial narrative error: He changed the story of KING KONG into a more conventional version of ""Beauty and the Beast"". To understand why this was a mistake, we need to look at Merian C. Cooper's made up ""Old Arabian Proverb"" which opens the original film:""And the prophet said:'And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty.And it stayed its hand from killing.And from that day, it was as one dead.'""In Jackson's remake, Carl Denham recites this proverb onstage at Kong's debut. However, it's not quite the same:""And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty.And beauty stayed his hand.And from that day forward, he was as one dead.""Note that in Cooper's original text it's beauty's face that stays the beast's hand. In other words, it's her physical beauty alone that touches his primitive heart, not anything she herself does. There's nothing in the proverb to suggest that she warms up to him, and the '33 film adheres to that premise. Jackson altered the proverb and hence the whole point of the story by having beauty play an active role in taming and nurturing the beast, just as in the fairy tale ""Beauty and the Beast"". He confused Cooper's film with something else entirely, and spawned the ""it needed improvement"" myth about the original. There's nothing to improve.  The '33 KING KONG is a downbeat tale not just because Kong dies, but because Ann Darrow rejects him and thereby unwittingly contributes to the tragedy. It's a classic fable of unrequited love. If it's changed, the whole story falls apart. This is why the final line, ""It was beauty killed the beast"" works perfectly in the original but seems forced and out of place in Jackson's remake. He would have done better to leave it out as was done in the '76 version which also had the girl make friends with Kong.A story as fantastic as KING KONG needs a streamlined, unpretentious treatment for it all to click, and ultimately Jackson's version fails by trying to be ""something more"" when nothing more is necessary. That's okay though, because in the end it just further emphasizes the singular glory of the original KING KONG, and it's now safe to assume we won't be seeing any more vain attempts at trying to recapture that glory anew.

They should re-make bad movies and try to make them better.This movie was more of a bad video game than a movie.  The special effects were so obviously inauthentic that they were almost laughable.The first hour was fine, and was comedic.  Then the movie got into gore when the party got to the island, and any thought of comedy disappeared.  It seemed like a horror movie.  And then when Kong appeared, it switched to action/fantasy.  In New York, it was just plain silly.	1.0	Stick with the 1930s original!	2006-04-21	25	11	14
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3FVQH6WUCY1NO	CE Johnson	"I guess I'm kind of picky: I like movies that are entertaining. This one has so many faults that I was relieved when it ended. One of those faults is that it took over three hours to end this abomination of a movie. I'll just list out some of the other problems with this movie:1. Editing - Every scene in a movie should contribute something to the plot or character development. Too many scenes in King Kong were just there as gratuitous action without adding anything to the plot or characters. And the viewer's response is, ""Here we go again, the characters are going to fight mudpeople, dinosaurs, bugs, Kong, etc...."" Peter Jackson really needed a strong-minded editor to edit out about half of this movie. Then the editor should have burned whatever was left.2. Poor special effects - In this age of amazing CGI effects, there is no excuse for unbelievable visuals in a movie, especially one with a large budget and a well-known director. The effects in King Kong are so bad that you can see the outline of the actors against the greenscreen. It makes it really hard to watch an action scene when the viewer can see a visual difference between the actors and the effects. One might expect them to integrate the effects better with the actors.3. Poorly thought out action scenes - One of the scenes with the bad CGI/Actor integration issues involved the characters running through a brontosaurus stampede. Those Brontosauri were practically stepping on the actors, yet no one got so much as a little bruise from the experience. They should have been squashed like bugs. Although, that might be wishful thinking. In another scene, Kong is fighting off several T-Rexes while carrying Ann Darrow, the female lead character, in his hands like a Barbie Doll. The scene goes on and on, with Kong tossing Darrow from hand to hand while he's swatting the T-Rexes, and then running, ape-style, with his knuckles often hitting the ground for balance and traction. If Darrow were really in his hand when it hit the ground, she would have been completely crushed. But, at the end of this drawn-out fight scene, her dress wasn't even torn. Granted, this is a sci-fi/fantasy movie, but one would expect some of the physical laws of the universe to hold true.4. Continuity issues - First there were the mudpeople, whose tribe suddenly dropped off the face of the planet about mid-way through the movie. Did the director forget about them, as if they were some kind of disposable plot device, useful only so long as they presented an obstacle to the main characters? And then there's the issue of transporting Kong. By the time the explorers/film-makers got to Skull Island, their boat had taken such a beating that it was barely floating. And the boat appeared to be smaller than King Kong. Peter Jackson expects us to believe that these resourseful folks somehow managed to get the oversized ape onto this too-small boat. And, how did they get him from the shore to the boat? All they had was one small dinghy that was barely big enough for the landing party. Then, we are to believe that this non-seaworthy boat got the big ape back to New York. Hmmm... no wonder the director chose not to include the boat-ride home in this movie. That's the one scene he managed to edit out of King Kong.Don't bother seeing thim movie unless you're interested in how bad a big-budget movie can be."	1.0	Worst Movie Ever	2006-05-04	40	22	18

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A35CV2FG6DADWZ	Charles E. Bradshaw	Some would like to suggest that Peter Jackson is like the second coming of George Lucas, back in his hey-days. However, I feel that he has more in common with P.T. Barnum. I've never felt more underwhelmed nor emotionally cheated as I did watching King Kong. I couldn't wait to see it, and while I loathed the later two LOTR films, I had faith that Jackson could bring together a more concentrated effort here. But when I was sitting in the theater and it got to New York (by then I was already well disgruntled with the movie) and Anne walks in fashion model slow-mo with a bright, heavenly light behind her, up to a dazzled Kong... I just had to look around and see if anyone else was buying this crap.The story itself, while fundementally the same as its 1930's counterpart, mind bogglingly meanders with the utmost tedium through in-jokes, stale dialogue, and a myriad of disjointed scenes that never seem to amount to anything. It's almost ironic that the 1930's film, while exceptionally shorter, seems to, at once, cover more territory and allow for more character developement. It's not that Jackson's Kong doesn't have plenty of character developement, its that it is so erroniously out of place that I never ended up caring for the supposed main characters.And sure, the special effects were fine and dandy, they were an eye sore of technical achievement. So much so that I could hardly see a damn thing sometimes, especially in the fights and in the wide shots. When Kong and the V. Rex are fighting, I could, at best, make out fur, scales, and noise. The camera was so close, that it wasn't intense, it was nauseating. And I won't go off on how utterly silly Kong acts through out the film. He may be a giant monkey, but that doesn't mean he has to act like a three year old. I was expecting a sympathetic character, a creature with a respectable sense of age and weight. Instead he's pathetic, more like a pea brained child than a 30 ft. tall super mammal.This is the Hollywood formula at it's finest. It's got great production values, expensive effects, big name actors, a big name property, clean cinematography, and no soul. I see people all the time just getting dazzled and suckered in by Hollywood's glossy veil that they can't see that there's nothing behind it. This film is nothing but an excercise in excess and incompetence, and as such, that it has seen such momentus sucess suggests that Barnum was right about suckers. I would also hazard a guess that everyone one of them was born here, in the US.	1.0	Alone in an Audience of the Blind	2006-03-29	30	16	14
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AEVNUEDRGTC4P	Charles J. Rector	For anyone who grew up watching the original King Kong, Peter Jackson's remake is especially disappointing. It is far less realistic or exciting than the original. While the original producers knew how to make a compelling hour and a half long film, Jackson clearly has no idea how to do that in a three hour long flick where he does not have a lengthy novel to serve as his literary guide.After a promising beginning, Jackson's film starts to go south when we arrive at Skull Island. This movie has much more action and adventure on Skull Island than did the original. This movie has at least five major action sequences on Skull Island. These scenes have some fun value, but due to Jackson's use fo fuzzily photographed, slow-motion scenes, they are not as much fun as they could have been.An especially disappointing aspect of Jackson's version is that his three lead actors are able to repeatedly survive falling into ravines, numerous waves of attacking monsters and a dinosaur stampede without suffering even so much as a single injury. The remainder of the ship's crew perish, but the impossibility of the three lead actors being able to survive and thrive under those circumstances is a massive violation of the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoying a film such as this.Fundamentally, King Kong is not an action flick but rather a love story between the great ape and the beautiful blonde. This aspect of Jackson's film is poorly handled and gets pretty sappy.Basically, fans of the original King Kong are well advised to leave this one alone.	1.0	Peter Jackson's Awful Remake of King Kong	2006-05-08	52	33	19

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ANBSW3BALFRR2	Chet Fakir	"Yes Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 classic is flawed. While I didn't mind the extra time devoted to character development in the beginning, judging from many of the other reviews it's obviously too long for some viewers. Director Peter Jackson may be accused by some as the king of bloat, endlessly padding his movies with superfluous action scenes that don't really move the story along and Kong is no exception. The most obvious example for me is the dinosaur stampede scene. Jack Black and crew run under a herd of brachiosaurs while being simultaneously hunted by velociraptors. Well, a little or a lot of belief suspension is needed depending on your point of view and it is action for action's sake. But this is a fantasy movie, an escapist diversion designed to entertain, which it does quite well. This isn't Citizen Kane and it isn't ment to be. It's not meant to conform to reallity. Let's face it, if Kong were real, every time he moved the weight of his body would snap his arms and spine like twigs. But for the most part the action is outstanding, especially Kong's battle with three tyranosaurs and the scenery and sets are wonderful.But where PJ succeeds is not in the over the top choreographed action sequences, but in the emotional resonance he brings to Kong. He was able to make a CGI monkey not only believable, but a powerful character in his own right. He's not just a monster. Kong is portrayed as an embattled warrior/king whose scared body belies his ultimate loneliness. He is the last of his kind and his human-like pathos is amazing and palpable. Andy Serkis the actor who also played Gollum in the Lord Of The Rings was the model for King Kong and it is his facial expressions that were used as the basis for Kong. He really should win some sort of award for ""best digital actor"" or whatever you would call it as it is a new category marvelously pioneered by he, PJ and the effects folks. Kong is ultimately destroyed by his love for Ann Darrow portrayed by Naomi Watts and it is this relationship, his love and her sympathy and empathy for this lonely king that makes this movie so compelling. Kong is a tragic and sympathetic figure. The  moment he dies you can see the light go out of his eyes, a remarkable bit of CGI wizardry and it is truly sad. As Jack Black says at the end of the movie with dialog lifted verbatim from the original, ""twas beauty killed the beast.""As far as the DVD is concerned Peter Jackson and company have once again outdone themselves in the extra features department. There's enough to keep you occupied for some time. Well done."	4.0	It's KING KONG people, not Citizen Kane, sheesh...	2007-02-19	5	5	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A25TDEGIPHZTZS	"chris banez lim ""Crutchead"""	After embarking on the LORD OF THE RINGS movie adaptation project - director Peter Jackson did an excellent take on re-doing the mythos of the best-ever 1930's monster flick King Kong, repackaged with modern day special effects and production for the silver screen. Indeed a whole hell lotta improvement from the previous original Dino De Laurentiis bore-fest remake from the 70's with Jeff Bridges (which spawned a number of sequels, both official and no), I guess with those digital effects that at times just looks so artificial, it would've never been that effective if not for Peter Jackson's directorial prowess - that made it possible for them to incorporate a lot of other giant monster, insects, dinosaurs and creatures - which are originally incorporated anyway to te original idea of Skull Island where Kong reigns supreme.This time, it however is a peculiar occurance on me that the lady-in-distress and object of Kong's affection is played by not only a convincing but a very attractive actress who's really quite perfectly fitting for the role (and again a lot of improvement from Laurentiis' take back in the 70's featuring Jessica Lang in the role as one named Dwan (perhaps having Sissy Spacek being casted then would've made much of a difference I guess)that being only 5 years old, my older brothres would tease me out for what that i didn't know of), when it turned out to be Naomi Watts! Again prior to watching the flick I've avoided previews and reviews 'til I watched the film myself -- and what peculiarity there is it's that I always find Ms. Watts incredibly attractive... gorsh , I'm drooling.I've seen it in the cinema on some digital stereo - dunno if its on DOLBY DIGITAL as the lady in the ticket booth indeed said when i asked, but the sound effects are enough to be the one worthy for the academy awards.However this rendition of Kong is a great move for director Peter Jackson, whom prior to the LOTR series is one whom I personally have on my lists amongst great movie directors above Steven Spielberg.Marvellous.(Just a viewers prattle on what he felt about the flick though)RATE: ('') ('') ('') ('') (' = 9 0ut of 1O	4.0	THE GORILLA IN KONG MADE HIM DO IT !!	2005-12-25	2	0	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ	Chris Kennison	The faults of King Kong are without a doubt overshadowed by the sheer entertainment and spectacle, but the faults, I think, will keep it from getting a best picture award. It'll get technical awards and MAYBE a best actress? Yet, it's still a fantastic movie and in my opinion, the best movie of the year.First off, I think Kong Kong has some pacing issues. You know, I'm not one of the people that hates long movies. In fact, I'm just the opposite. If I'm INTO THE MOVIE... give it to me! In fact, I'm sort of hoping that there will be a director's cut, because I know there was stuff missing.After watching King Kong, I couldn't help but think that some key scenes were missing.  The journey home. The jump from chloroforming Kong to the show night was uncomfortable and lacked build up.I also thought they spent too much time in the early stages, especially on the boat. The early scenes seemed to go slow and were meticulous. Then the closing scenes... starting with Kong's chase on the island until the end of the movie, seemed to go WAY TOO FAST and didn't spend time delivering emotional impact. They should have been less meticuous in the beginning and more meticulous in the end.Also, there were times when the green screening didn't look all that great... like the dinosaur rampage and a couple of other places. In other places, the green screen and f/x were SO GOOD, that you wouldn't even think that you were looking at an effect. Otherwise, the movie delivered on all levels.It had great performances. Especially by Naomi Watts. She's been robbed two years in a row of an oscar. They'll give her one this time because she should have won the last 2 years.The time period was a great choice. From the moment that the adventures/moviemakers set foot on Skull island, the movie shifts into high gear and never again lets up. Dazzling action sequences! Touching moments between Anne Darrow (Watts) and Kong. Especially when Kong sees what his little barbie toy can do.Finally, the ending sequence was AMAZING! Breathtaking as Kong pounded his chest atop the Empire State Building. The camera circled with the planes and it was awe inspiring to watch.King Kong is phenominal and WITHOUT A DOUBT something that HAS TO BE SEEN ON THE BIG SCREEN! Kong won't look as big on your little T.V. at home. It's a must see. See it for the action. See it for the love story. You won't be sorry.	4.0	Phenominal and Beautiful... but not without its faults	2005-12-17	1	0	1

Though this screenplay sometimes risked going 'over the top' with the action scenes between people and various creatures, I loved it. Worth watching over and over. The fact that they've come so far in special effects helped add to the immense impact of this movie. Also, having the characters in color helps one see the facial expressions of the actors, and the facial expressions and emotions shown through the eyes increases the intensity and enhances the bond between 'beauty and beast'.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AD5JI9UN98JPH	christmas lover	First let me start by saying that I emphasize with those people who think this movie is too long. Thats the only thing that kept me from going to see it in the theater. Actually it goes by pretty  quick for me and that includes the extended edition. This is the best of three of them althouth I do like all three of them.Naomi Watts Jack Black and Adrien Brody are better or at least as good as the original three. Jack Black played Carl a movie producer trying hard to get a hit movie. Adrien Brody played Jack a playwrite who is tricked into riding with them on that ship. And finally Naomi Watts plays Ann a down on her luck actress whose luck is so bad that she actually believes that nothing good lasts a feeling she doesnt shake. Until the end because even though King Kong dies she ends up with her true love-Jack. Now lets get back to what I like about the movie. I really love the extra scenes in the extended edition. They make the movie ten times better. The dinosaurs werent even in the first remake.  Thats the one that has the most flaws and thats just the begining but like I said I like all three of them. King Kong is my favorite movie and  if I recommeded it I would recomend the original. Better still I would reccomend this version of King Kong and the extented edition which is made ten times better by the three extra scenes as I said earlier. King Kong lives. Yes King Kong lives. And this is the best one. If you want to watch the original go ahead. Otherwise watch this one or better yet the extented edition.  I cant say it enough. This is the best version especially the extended edition.Theres an extra dinosaur scene. There is a river or moat scene that isnt in the theater version. Actually its more of a raft scene. He fights three dinosaurs in the dinosaur fight. When she was rescued King Kong was asleep and quickly not to mention inadvernadly woken up. They wouldnt have gotten away if they hadnt frightened up some pterodactyls. King Kong is an excellent movie. Like I said Im not trying to get negative but some people dont understand that in a movie like this you cant have instant action. You also cant see King Kong right away. This brings me back to my original point lentgh. Some people dont understand that the first hour was spent getting to know the charactors. I understood that once I gave this version a chance. As for the annimation/cgi who cares if there was too much of it. I found it thrilling. One scene I find funny is when Ann and Jack first meet and she mistakes some one else for him. That is actually one of the few funny scenes as this is meant to be an action movie rather than a comedy. But getting back to the annimation/cgi as I said I found it thrilling. And believable by the way. Unlike most people by the way I dont think there was too much of it. I loved it. I dont want to get negative or have too many people get mad at me which Im sure some will but thats what I think. I dont see why some people wanted to see the natives again especially the way they were portrayed. Besides you dont need to see them at all after Ann is sacrificed to King Kong a fact only Peter Jackson knew for sure. He did the best job he could which was his best with the story especially the extended edition and its three extra scenes.As well as some extented scenes.This brings us back to annimation which was used in at least two of those scenes.You cant do a movie like this without some kind of annimation which not everybody understands. Dino De Laurentis tried and thats why his version even though I like it is as bad as it is. Merian Cooper used stop motion annimation. Peter Jackson chose cgi which like stop motion annimation I found thrilling. I loved it. Jacksons version also stays true to Coopers unlike De Laurentis who destroyed the story  that is KING KONG when he made his version. Anyway Peter Jacksons version -paticularly the extended edition-is the best. King Kong lives.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AVTATH1R5ILLT	Christopher Gooch	"King Kong is another of Peter Jackson's epic movies.  While the plot-on the surface-doesn't seem like it is worthy of being called and epic (nor was its length, originally), Jackson has made it one.  The plot is sprawling, but not to a bad point.  Although it contains many elements of a drama, it doesn't get bogged down.  There is constant tension and conflict on many levels.There are three real parts to the plot (following the classic plot structure-beginning-middle-end): meeting the characters and getting to know them in Manhattan and on the ship, Skull Island, and Kong in Manhattan.Now, granted, Jackson didn't conjure up the plot out of nowhere, but he sure as heck improved it.  I have seen Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, but I haven't really had a chance to pick them apart and really watch them.  So I was really surprised by Jackson's ability to layer the plot and add many different ironies.I am an avid Hitchcock fan, so I am used to really analyzing movies and paying much attention to the details.  Many directors disappoint me on this level, but Jackson surpassed all my expectations.  Hitchcock took every one of his films (to the best of my knowledge) from a novel or story.  Thus, like Jackson in Kong, Hitchcock already had a plot and story to work from, allowing him to focus his time on improving the plot and paying much attention to detail.  This seems to be the case with Jackson in Kong.Here are some of the different layers that I picked up on.  When we first see the native girl on the island, she holds her hand up with her palm facing down.  Later, after Kong and Anne Darrow meet and get to know each other, Kong stretches out his hand with his palm facing upward.  This point is made even more significant when you think of what each wanted-the natives wanted to offer Anne up as a sacrifice while Kong wanted to pick Anne up to hold on to her.Also, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) says that Carl Denham (Jack Black) ""destroys the things that he loves"" (or something to that effect).  That comment was obviously intended to apply to Kong, who, in that scene is looking pitiful on stage.  But it can also be applied to Anne Darrow, whose life was destroyed because of Denham-as well as many in his crew.Another point would be that in the beginning of the movie, Anne's theater closes.  One of the characters says ""The show is over,"" or something to that effect.  This leads directly to the line ""The show must go on,"" and it does, later in the movie with the eighth wonder of the world.The story really has something for everyone without stretching itself too thin.  Often I think that many movies fail because they try to be everything to everyone.  But Kong really succeeds here.  It is probably one of the only movies to combine drama and action/suspense so perfectly.The characters were well created.  Some reviewers claim that the first hour of the movie dragged.  It did not drag.  Granted, the focus was a little more on drama, but it was necessary.  That first part of the movie established the characters, the setting and the period wonderfully.  Jackson knew what he was doing.My only gripe here was Carl Denham.  While Jack Black's performance was really well done, I think some of his dialogue didn't really fit.  For instance, when the camera man was killed by the dinosaur, Denham says (in an identical line to the one used earlier), ""We'll donate our profits to his wife and kids.""  This comical line would work in another movie but not here.  It just was not realistic.  If the line had been changed or altered slightly, it would have worked.  Denham's obsession was really a fascinating part of the story.The actors (and actresses) gave outstanding performances.  Naomi Watts really put her heart into this movie.  She deserves at very least an Academy Award nomination for her performance.  Andy Serkis created a Kong with some heart and soul.  Adrien Brody, Jack Black and the other actors gave great performances as well.The music was very moving and powerful.  I liked how they used symphonic music as well as the period, jazzy songs in the movie.  I'm definitely going to get a hold of the sound track for this movie.The cinematography was excellent.  Jackson really likes to use half-frame (or slower) shots.  I felt that some uses of the slow-mo shots were overdone, but most were very well done.  The cinematography sometimes reminded me of Lord of the Rings with its epic, wide-angle shots.All in all this is one of the best movies I've seen recently."	5.0	Beauty Killed the Beast	2006-04-01	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2KGCK3Q4VARC8	Christopher Greffin	In my opinion Peter Jackson's King Kong is one of the best films of 2005. It's about the struggle of people during the depression, adventures on and island full of dangerous creatures, and the relationship of man, and of course woman, with a misunderstood beast. In a nutshell is about human nature during adverse circumstances, and it's one hell of an entertainment and exciting ride from begining to end.Let me adress the biggest complaint the movie recieves: it's length. Yes I think it could have been shorter, particularly in the first act, but I've seen this movie three time and never have I thought the movie really drags very much in any area. The second act, the longest of the three acts, that takes place on the island, is nothing short of spectacular, with no less than four amazing intense action sequences. I'm certainly glad Jackson went all out in that middle act; it's something for the ages. And the third act, back in New York city, is done very well with a lot of heartfelt emtion and really needed the time it uses to build to the powerful conclusion.The acting is all round solid, with Naomi Watts, in the famous role Fay Wray played more than seventy years prior, giving the film's strong performance. The rest of the cast, Adrian Brody and Jack black, along with supporting roles of the crew of the ship, are good enough to not slow the momentum of the reall stars. Watt's Ann Darrow may be the only standout human role, but that's fine because she backed up extrodinarily by Kong, Skull Island, and New York city, all which look great and never are uninteresting.I highly recomend this movie. The single disk edition that I bought has no special features of note. There's also a three disk edition and soon there will be a blu-ray version. Do yourself a favor and pick this up in some form.	5.0	Great exciting escapist entertainment	2008-12-27	1	1	0

When they arrive on the island, the native people capture Ann and offer her as a sacrifice to it turns out, an enormous gorilla. In trying to rescue Ann, the ship and film crew capture the ape and take him back to New York where the film maker displays him in a Broadway theater, until he escapes his chains and runs amok in New York City.The movie's writer has fallen in love with Ann. In his fervor to rescue her, he feels nothing but anger toward the great ape. But Ann has fallen in love with the beast and he with her. He has shown her a compassionate, contemplative side. He has risked his life and protected her from other creatures on the island like dinosaurs. When they are back in New York, Ann feels lost being separated from Kong and seeing him as a prisoner.Peter Jackson's King Kong is a visually spectacular movie. The effects are wonderful. Kong looks like a real gorilla unlike past versions of the great ape. All the scenes with animals and insects on the island are very well done. The movie is also written very well. It moves along nicely and the pace keeps stepping. The sentimentality between Kong and Ann is different from other versions of this film and while it seems odd at first, it works in the end. In fact, it is this love between them that makes Kong's death in the end one of the saddest things I've seen on film. The camera focuses on his eyes, on his feeling for Ann and the life draining out of them.The only complaint I have about the movie is its length. There are several scenes that go on far too long and so make the movie overlong. All in all though, this is a wonderful movie.	4.0	An effects laden movie that also has a soul	2006-12-10	1	0	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2Y7SD9X8BDWGA	Christopher Weiss	Everyone over the age of 16 knows the story of King Kong.  It is an icon in pop culture, including children's cartoons.  This movie helps to cement the story in modern mythology by using CGI graphics and fantastic directing.  I loved it except for the few flaws that kept me from giving it five stars.The central weakness is Jack Black.  He is not believable enough in his role.  This character needs to be darkly comical.  Unfortunately, Jack Black is just too silly an actor to pull it off.  Danny Devito or Jack Nicholson would have worked much better.  Black's performance doesn't ruin the movie, but it is certainly distracting.Naomi Watts was wonderful, and her performance was enthralling.  Her link to Kong felt genuine.  Her vaudeville athleticism was endearing and added authenticity to her character.My teenage daughters couldn't watch the original King Kong because it was too silly and dated for them.  The use of CGI and the updated cinematography has made this film a classic.  By the end of the movie all of my daughters were crying, and I was tired.  I couldn't believe how much time I spent watching the movie by the time it was done.  It was only my own exhaustion that told me that, yes, in fact three hours had passed.The movie is best in the theater, so watch it on a big TV if you can.	4.0	An incredible remake	2006-05-26	3	1	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2SLWXD4HT0CT	"Cj D. Vries ""HRH"""	"This is a DVD you should own - no question about it. I was a young boy when the Jessica Lange/Jeff Bridges version came out and absolutely loved that movie. When I bought it on DVD years later I thought it had dated terribly! But this new version by Peter Jackson HAS to be the ultimate King Kong.  This is an adventure movie that is supposed to sweep us away to unexplored fantastical lands and creatures and to stimualte our imaginations and emotions. This it does, and how!  It is not a 100% perfect movie, and you could , if you really wanted to, question a couple of decisions made by Mr Jackson regarding some plotlines. But to sit and squabble about why Jack wasnt wounded when the insects were shot from his body, or why the sunrise came so quickly on Kong's last day in New York (and all the other problems the sourfaced critics pointed out),is to totally miss the point! This is a larger than life story, and thus larger than life things happen! You are supposed to sit back and enjoy this amazing tale. The special effects are breathtaking and Kong looks absolutely real. At the end I sat sobbing like an unbalanced schoolgirl. I will be able to watch this movie lots of times in years to come , which is why this is a perfect ""buy"" DVD. I also recommend the second disc with all those very insightful video dairies and a documentary about NY in the 1930's. King Kong is wonderful and magical entertainment!"	5.0	Hail to the Kong	2006-04-18	4	3	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A24F1UX8ZT5IXY	C.J. Hustwick	"Jack Black delivers almost all of his lines wrong. Adrien Brody obviously is in love with himself. The Heart of Darkness references were ridiculous. I think they actually missed out on the darker, pitch-black undertones to the original. A lot of things are wrong with this film.But Kong looks amazing. Seeing it in the theater was a thrill. And it was genuinely moving to an old movie fan. I don't know if we'll ever see anything quite like it again.Having just watched nearly all of the 3-disc materials, I think I can safely say that the film has shown a lot of its strengths and weaknesses on DVD. The strengths are astounding: Weta has crafted the most impressive Special FX film to date, brought to life with an incredible amount of sincerity, and Peter Jackson his proven himself to be one of the great directors of all time. The weaknesses are also glaring: the boat ride to the island now seems amateurish and dull, deleted scenes reveal the at times godawful script, and despite being the greatest celebration of boyhood ever put to film -- the film takes the ""adult"" undertones in all the wrong directions. Amazing enough, this is one part of the '76 Kong that is somewhat interesting.Another telling aspect of the 3 DVD set is that very little attention is really paid to the actual story. You would think that after all of the FX featurettes that Jackson would really take the time on the audio commentary to talk about this material and what they were trying to say with it. No such luck. As soon as it starts, the writers seem to be grabbing at straws for things to say beyond the purely superficial. There is no argument that King Kong is a film with MAJOR cultural history. So, all this serves to reinforce the grating aspects of the script such as Jack Driscoll's literary ""brilliance""... which makes little sense as they purposefully use his character as a pawn to wedge in cheesy dialogue from the old film (the boat ride scene), and then as a 1930s ""rebel"" writing screwball tripe. It seemed clever the first time around...The deleted scenes are also very revealing. Most are lousy or superfluous, but two really caught my attention: one that is in the ""director's cut"" and one that is only a supplement. The former comes near the very end, where one of the army sargeants yells at his men ""this is a city made for people! You want some dumb monkey running around?!!"" blah blah blah... It completely detracts from the majesty and emotion of the scene and is a shameless villainization. I believe it shows the influence of the cloying Frank Darabont. Another scene, not in the film, is where Preston (the assistant) confronts Denham about taking the voyage to Skull Island upon finding the map. It makes Preston's character seem whiney and too earnest, whereas in the theatrical release he comes across as the quiet, understated conscience of the film. Unfortunately, once you have witnessed scenes like this it's harder to swallow some of the more egregious emotionalism of the original release.Still, I remember seeing this in the theater and being swept off my feet. Maybe it's a great thing that people still make films that really have to be experienced rather than dissected."	4.0	Fascinating material, but the Extended Version is a mixed blessing.	2005-12-16	370	286	84
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2Q2KWHGPTWEOW	"Clain Hawk ""CJ"""	In 1993 Steven Spielberg blessed us with Jurassic Park, the movie was a sight to behold the special effects of the dinosaurs were spectacular.  Nearly thirteen years later Peter Jackson attempts to awe his audiences in the same matter.  King Kong tried to hard to replicate Spielberg's success.  The movies special effects were worse than we witnessed twelve years ago.  Where have movies gone sense 1993?  Backwards.  The CG in this movie was anything but spectacular.  I found myself laughing at how horrible the graphics look for a movie of this size.The horrible graphics aside there were two other contributing factors to this movies downfall.  First, the movie was far to long.  At three hours and seven minutes long I found myself tired and disinterested.  The movie seemed to have the same long drawn out scenes which although were interesting at first became old and repetitive.  The same movie with the same story could have been made in a simple two hours.  Jackson tried to hard to replicate the success he had with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I'm not sure why Hollywood feels they need to bore audiences with long meaningless scenes that fail to contribute to the story.  I feel that Hollywood has failed to produce a well-written movie sense Lord of the Rings.  The one and only exception being Walk The Line, which still managed to have some long boring scenes.  The second factor that I felt made this movie as bad as it was, quite simply the horrible acting, throughout the movie I found myself laughing at how bad Jack Black was portraying his character.  Face it Jack you're a comedian stick to that.One last thing about this movie I found was the fight sequences.  I don't know what it is with film makers these days but ever sense the Borne Identity was released every director thinks they need that choppy in your face fight scenes where nobody can tell what is going on.  Frankly it was good in those movies and that is all.  I personally think Jackson isn't as great as a director as everybody makes him out to be.  He is repetitive bleak and unexciting.Thank You	1.0	Whatever happened to movies?	2005-12-14	29	12	17

But from the very beginning of this movie I knew right off it was going to be really good. The way he shows New York city during the 1930's was very impressive. I looked my hardest for even the tiniest mistake in the computer animation but could not find any, I had a hard time telling whether or not it was CGI at first. I actually liked the first 45 minutes of this movie and think Jackson does a very good job of setting the mood and build up to the first action sequence. The action in the is movie is unbelievable, and the CGI is some of the best I have seen in a long time, probably since ""The return of the king"". Somehow Jackson has figured out the correct way to combine action and CGI without leaving the viewer bored or laughing at just how fake it looks. He does the action scenes the correct way and you will not be able to stop looking at the screen. You won't find yourself looking at your watch or yawning wishing it would just end. I definitely think this movie needs to be seen on the big screen to really be enjoyed properly.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"A lot of people tend to say one thing about Hollywood remakes: why? What for? When you have an original that's easily a classic, there almost seems little point to revisit. Peter Jackson said King Kong was his inspiration to be a filmmaker so maybe it's a case of the student trying to become the teacher? A way of saying ""thanks""? An update? I don't know but as it stands the film is pretty good entertainment with large amount of flaws all over the place.You all know the story but I must repeat it. Carl Denham is a filmmaker who is not delivering on his films. He decides to get out quickly on a filmmaking chance of a lifetime but he needs an actress. He finds Ann Darrow, a struggling vaudeville actress. Bringing her in, they head toward the mysterious Skull Island where more than just locals roam.Officially the film won for Best Visual Effects which personally I don't understand. There's obvious CG shots all over the place including some much needed redos on compositing. In New York at the end it's absolutely beautiful on top of the Empire State Building but on Skull Island it's almost cringe-inducing at parts. Not to mention the sounds outside of Kong are merely ok but go figure, they won Best Sound and Sound Editing. T-Rex's don't sound big enough personally.The other flaw is the action sequences. Yes they're cool and yes they're exciting but they're also incredibly silly. When you got guys running from a herd of brontosaurs and only 4 or so get trampled in such a narrow space is hard to believe. Not to mention when they topple over. Then there's Kong fighting no less than 3 V-Rexes(apparently they're not T ones they're V) with only bites doesn't add up. No big chunk missing or torn flesh, it's merely teeth marks and blood. It might sound like I'm nitpicking but when you want people to believe in such an extravagant world it helps to nail reality's details, even if it does have large spiders and a gorilla.One more nitpick: its editing and length. Much of this film could've been chopped off. Spielberg even when making the 2 1/2 hour Close Encounters or 3+ hour Schindler's List, never made a boring film(some exceptions may apply). Jackson on the other hand might need to fire his editor since so much is rather unneccessary. It's as if the only way to make the film epic is to pack it with as much as you can. Subplots and sidestories(such as a cabin boy and a father-like figure) are never resolved.Where the film works is the acting, despite its odd casting choices. Jack Black makes a good Denham but not an excellent one and Adrien Brody doesn't scream action hero to me. The supporting cast is good though with the under-utilized Colin Hanks(bit of a slip when I mentioned Tom instead). Naomi Watts is the perfect Ann Darrow though, tough and very emotional. In fact, it's probably rare to not find her teary eyed in the film, and quite a set of lungs. Her screams people although the other thing...It's one of the most biggest and expensive movies ever yet I feel it's not an A picture but it's not a so bad it's good B picture. It's like a B+, entertaining but so much problems it has."	3.0	3.5; it's exciting, slow, cool and silly all at the same time	2006-03-30	2	0	2

The first hour was incredibly slow since the title is King Kong.  However, the first appearance of King Kong is shown close to the second hour.  After that, the movie will have you glued to the screen.This movie is filled with action.  From King Kong fighting with dinosaurs to him constantly trying to save Ann, you will not get bored.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1GI36Q9R4UG08	"C. Nolen ""maqulous"""	"What is it about a remake that creates such skepticism within everyone? Perhaps the most common argument heard every time a film is re-made: ""Why redo something that was perfect the first time?"" It's a question often posed when a new band covers a classic song. The only real answer to the question is one that certainly applies to Peter Jackson's King Kong. It's a way to honor a classic film and introduce it to a whole new generation.Outlining the well-known plot of King Kong may be a futile practice, but please indulge me. Hoping for a great film and willing to do anything to make it, filmmaker Carl Denham (Black) sets sail on a small ship to Skull Island with his newly recruited actress, Ann Darrow (Watts). On the ship, Ann falls for the scriptwriter and author, Jack Driscoll (Brody). After reaching the Island, Denham finds it more dangerous than he had expected and has his actress kidnapped by the native people for sacrifice to Kong. While searching for Ann and after losing his film (along with a few of his shipmates) Denham decides he can still profit from this expedition by capturing Kong and bringing him back to New York.The first hour of the film is slow to say the least. Black's performance is drenched in melodrama in a successful attempt to reflect the 1933 film. But the hour of this in New York runs much longer than it should. When the film finally makes it on to the ship, it drags again to allow for the relationship between Darrow and Driscoll to form and grow. By the time we first see Kong, we felt like we've already watched an entire film and when considering the time that has elapsed that's not too difficult to imagine.As far as acting goes, this film was not challenging for the actors, but the performance was demanding. It's hard to imagine the giant inhabitants of Skull Island not being there as you see the reactions on the faces of the actors. It's easy to forget that these monsters are added in later by a computer. That is accredited to performance. I doubt that Naomi Watts ever thought she'd have to juggle in front of a giant ape or that Adrien Brody knew he would have to fight a monkey for the love of a woman. The interactions between the ape and the humans must be appreciated.Not surprisingly, the most interesting character to watch is Kong himself. His countenance alone runs parallel to the genres illustrated by the film. The anger of his face emphasizes the passion present in the fight scenes and supports the action significantly. The soft, human expression he displays when looking upon Darrow underlines the admiration he feels and the love story, which may be the strongest theme of the film. Our view of Kong changes throughout the film, and it's a skillful device on Jackson's part.Though the love story is strong, the action does not suffer. Don't be fooled, this film is a lot of fun to watch. It's easy to get taken in by the scene where Kong battles three Tyrannosaurus Rexes. Jackson has invested a lot of time in making sure every aspect of the film is just right, and he did not hold back on the action.As for the criticism this and other remakes have endured, I fail to see the harm in it. Peter Jackson was a fan of the original King Kong ever since he first saw it as a child. His film pays homage to the classic and that's apparent through small elements, not to mention the fact that he chose to set the film in the same time period as the original instead of making a modern update, as the worst of remakes choose to do.I noticed that many DVD stores started repackaging the original and putting it on display cases, as is the common routine when a remake comes out. After this new King Kong perhaps some people will check out the original, which is the greatest purpose for any remake. Not all of us were around in 1933 to see the mighty Kong on the screen for the first time, and we need a reminder of what made it so magical in the first place. The question here should not be ""why remake King Kong?"" Rather we should wonder if, after Lord of the Rings and the running time of King Kong at 187 minutes, is Peter Jackson capable of making a movie less than three hours long?"	4.0	A Remarkable Remake	2006-07-04	7	4	3

The good thing is that I found it to be more interesting than I would have guessed. Like many others, I felt that is was long. I feel there were at least two or three segments that could have been shortened while still accomplishing what was needed or essential to the movie. In general, I am not too interested in remakes of classics, so I decided to do this review for others that may have a spouse or friend that talks them into it.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1C4XZPPK9CBUM	Cobra	As another individual correctly noted this Blue Ray version does in fact contain both the theatrical and extended version of the film.  The NBC Universal Store web site verifies it.  Amazon simply failed to clarify this and they should do so because several others are disappointed that it doesn't appear to be here.  Peter Jackson's version of this classic film is simply visually stunning and it should be a reference quality Blue Ray film to show off a good video setup.  This is so much better than the cheap 1976 remake with Jeff Bridges.Mr. Jackson took the time to actually develop the characters and the story which indeed adds to the film just as he did in Lord of the Rings which depended on character development.  Far too many films today fail to deliver a full story and rely only on cheap special effects.  This is a rich and full story.  Some were critical of this fact and they apparently merely wanted to see a large ape captured, climb a large building and then fall off and die with little more than special effects to wow them for an hour.  This is not a film for those with such a short attention span or those interested only in computer graphic magic.  This is the full story of Kong and those who encountered him . . . and it's an incredibly good one and superbly stunning in cinematography.	5.0	Best Version of Kong Yet . . .

But I did it, like a souless drone I marched to the video store, paid my dues and suffered for over two hours until FINALLY they put that poor beast, and ME out of our misery.Two quick points:1.Special Effects and action should support a plot -  a plot should not be scribbled around effects and action sequences, which I am sure happened here.2.Action flicks can have a great story - there seems to be this trend in Hollywood toward producing action or adventure films with absolutely no attempt to stimulate the mind.  This movie is the perfect example - while my eyes bugged out of my head at times at the marvellous work of special effects, not once did I feel drawn to suspense or long to know more.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3AQDK1F0YQKAS	"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado"""	Well, I saw 'King Kong' tonight and it was brilliant.  From the start the audience is kind of rushed into the roaring twenties with depictions of every stereotype one can imagine from that fascinating and influential era.  Everything from the tolerance movement smashing booze bottles in the street, construction workers walking steel beams high atop sky scrapers to poor immigrants in New York City living in shanty towns scrounging for any morsel of food, no stone was left unturned in this aspect.These are desperate times indeed and Peter Jackson the director makes sure that the viewers are fully conscious of this, which helps set up future plot elements of the film.  Shortly after this, the audience is introduced to Ann Darrow, brought to life by in an extraordinary yet subtle performance by the enchanting actress Naomi Watts.  Ann Darrow is throwing a Vaudevillesque show on Broadway in New York, stunning the patrons with fantastic feats of showmanship such as juggling, dancing, singing and most importantly a passion for her work.  As most of her peers and fellow New Yorkers, despite her talent and love of the show, she's not getting paid and it's not easy to perform on an empty stomach.  She receives some comfort from a fellow thespian, an older gentleman, who appears as somewhat of a mentor and provider of moral support.  Merrily they go off to dinner, but their happiness is short lived.  The very next day they are informed that they've been laid off, and their paychecks are as empty as their pockets.  Grumbling and dissatisfaction aside, they quickly accept their downtrodden status and go about their lives, except for Ann who refuses to entirely give up her dreams.  She pursues a few dead end roads, but it won't be long before she gets more than she bargained for.In the mean time the film introduces Jack Black's excellent portrayal of Carl Denham, moving pictures director-extraordinaire, who is struggling with convincing Hollywood big shots of the merit of his animal footage depicting monkeys picking lice off each other.  Perhaps needless to say, the producers are less than impressed with Denham's presentation and so a defensive backlash ensues against the funders of his endeavors.  It doesn't go all too well, and so Carl and his assistant Preston, effectively portrayed by his former 'Orange County' co-star Colin Hanks, aka Tom Hanks' son, rush out of the building with all their movie reels and hastily plan what sounds like a ludicrous scheme to save whatever remains of their seemingly ill-fated movie dream.Things are not as bad as they might seem, however, as Carl goes on his search for a fair maiden to portray the damsel in distress that he has in mind for his fantastical film which at this point is not much more than a twinkle in his crazy eyes.  At first his search is fruitless, but before his feeling of futility sets in, he lays his wild-eyed gaze upon an angel of no lesser description, a beauty that illuminates her surroundings.  His eyes are fixed and her aura captures his imagination, and he knows he has found the perfect woman for the part he has in mind for the biggest project of his life.  He introduces himself in a charming way that only Jack Black can pull off, and invites her to a dinner, something which she would like to but simply cannot refuse.  Luckily for Carl Denham she's starving, and so he convinces her, reluctantly, to join his voyage of uncertainty that's full of promise.  The clincher for Ann is to work with a screen writer by the name of Jack Driscoll, who she happens to be a big admirer of.What follows is a maddening journey that is foreshadowed by Ann's light step onto the boarding plank and her gentle touch of the bannister of the ship by the name of 'Venturer'.  There are a couple of other foreshadowing elements as well that hint of impending doom, such as one of the shipmates reading the classic novel entitled 'Heart of Darkness'.  Aboard the ship which Carl had essentially conned its captain into lending for his services, we meet another unfortunate soul who was fooled by the conniving Carl, and he is none other than the famous playwright Jack Driscoll.  Without giving too much away, there's a romance that develops which continues throughout the film, along with some minor character development until they reach the island which Carl believes has all the answers to his woes.  Carl basically shanghaied this ship so he could take his film crew and cast to an infamous, uncharted destination by the ominous name of 'Skull Island', which is another foreboding element of disasters to come.Upon the arrival on the island after narrowly escaping a harrowing battle against the islands cliffs and the ocean's surf, the crew of the 'Venturer' quickly learn that there is nothing ordinary about this island, something most of them already suspected throughout their journey across the sea.  The trials suffered by all on this remote and most hopeless of places are exhausting, not only by them but by the film's audience.  Event after event, the pace is unrelenting, adreline rush inducing, only slowing down long enough to give the audience pause to catch their breath.It's safe to assume at this point that everyone knows by the trailers that the special effects are truly stunning, well after watching the 3 hour movie it's even more amazing than most are led to believe by the short clips provided by the teasers.  King Kong himself is as believable as any of the real life cast members.  While the cast is magnificent, like Adrien Brody who does a convincing job as a geeky yet brave playwright/screenwriter, King Kong elicits a great deal of emotion but at the same time he commands respect with an awe-inspiring presence.  The interaction between him and Ann Darrow have moments of magic and brilliance, such tenderness to melt even the most hardened of hearts, not to mention enough action and fighting to excite the most jaded of movie goers.If there is one word that can sum up this film it would be passion.  There's passion abound in this film, off and on screen.  Peter Jackson clearly delivered a labor of love with 'King Kong', pouring his heart and soul into it.  Jack Black portrayed Carl Denham with a zealousness that made a believer out of me.  Carl became a real, greedy, seedy, yet in an ironic way a likeable film maker whose lofty goal of making the greatest film ever eventually led to his obsession that would manifest itself in success at no matter what cost to human life or other sacrifice.  Naomi Watts, where to begin.  She gave a very understated yet poignant performance as Ann Darrow, the demure, unassuming, starry-eyed beauty that captivated the heart of a beast.  Her performance was very giving, and really helped to bring to life King Kong.  King Kong himself is an artistic achievement the likes which have never been seen before.  He moves, breathes, feels, falls, bleeds and suffers just as much as the rest of us, yet he's just made of digital bits of 0's and 1's.  If the special effects team doesn't win an Oscar for this film, I will be shocked.  Much like Jackson's LOTR trilogy, there was an obvious passion on the part of the entire film crew, everything from the massive, elaborate sets, a living, breathing environment from the roaring twenties to an island of doom to the blitz of New York City's broadway.  I can't forget the score which richly complimented the moving movements of compassion, sorrow, heroism and comradery.  All around and in between there was deep felt passion in this film.If it hasn't been covered enough, the character development is well conceived, and I'm glad that Jackson took the time to flesh out the characters, not to mention build up the story to the climax that makes the film oh so satisfying.  This movie has it all.  This IS why I go to the movies, period.  It has literally something for everyone, and for those with patience this movie has plenty to offer, because at 3 hours it might be a little too long for some, but it is well worth the down time.One last thing to add about the film, the irony behind the story of King Kong and humanity is worthy for food for thought.  King Kong is a beast, but his humanity far surpasses that of most of the people depicted in the film.  Ann's outer beauty is matched by her inner beauty, and that is something which resonates within Kong's gargantuan heart.  Hopefully it will make people think about that for a moment, how such a living paradox in the form of a giant gorilla can have so much meaning that goes beyond the silver screen.I was genuinely moved several times during this film, and I don't say that about very many films, not at all.  Without a doubt this is the best movie that I've seen this year.  You owe it to yourself to see this film if you're just a fan of movies in general, I can almost guarantee you will not be disappointed.  I'm sure I missed something in my review, but I don't want to spoil too much of it, although hopefully I provided enough info for people to judge whether they want to see it or not.	5.0	'King Kong', Another Masterpiece From Jackson	2005-12-14	6	3	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A15G70V9OBTOVO	Coronet Blue	This new KK is fun and mostly exciting.  But it really is too long (because everyone already knows the story) and the entire movie belongs to Naomi Watts and Kong.Nothing wrong with that--as soon as I heard they had Naomi Watts I knew this movie would be a cut above.  But over the course of 3 hours there should be some other memorable characters and there aren't.  Jack Black and the others are ok but anybody could have been substituted and it wouldn't have made any difference.That's why, when its over, everybody remembers the Anne, Kong and the special effects.  The rest is pretty much filler.  My guess is, its Peter Jackson's ego and he has to embellish everything from the original, just to show that more is better.	4.0	Let's not get carried away.	2006-03-30	2	0	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3SFO2GSP5CVSM	"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom"""	I grew up with King Kong. King Kong was a friend of mine. Peter Jackson's nominal ape is no King Kong! When I was a child in New York, Thanksgiving Days would not have been the same without WOR-TV's King Kong marathons, which included the original 1933 film, its 1934 sequel- Son Of Kong, 1949's Mighty Joe Young, and several Japanese films with the same titular gorilla. My dad and I loved those films. Director Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong (and it is a remake of the 1933 classic, not a mere updating like the 1976 Jessica Lange camp classic) is not nearly as great a film as most of the critics say it is, but it's still a damned sight better than most films out today, and certainly most horror films. The single best thing Jackson did was to set the film in the 1930s, and not in the 2000s, because this harkens back to an era where it was still plausible to believe in undiscovered islands, and round the world trips to them were akin to what interplanetary travel is in space films that came along later. The worst thing Jackson did, however, was nearly double the screening time of the original film, bloating this version to nearly three hours. There simply isn't enough material, so he adds far too many silly scenes of the modern Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) ridiculously making goo-goo eyes at the twenty-five foot tall gorilla.This, and a few other negatives, make the newer version a much inferior one to the original, although better than the 1976 version. Now, don't get me wrong, the special effects in this film top even those of the Spielbergian dino-fests of the 1990s, but even though Jackson was wise to go back to a 1930s setting, did he have to go retro-racist to boot? I'm hardly PC, but the Skull Islanders' savage depiction was ghastly and incredibly demeaning. First, since the island was south of Sumatra, it would be inhabited by people who looked Indonesian, not Negroid, nor even Negritos. Second, that they were almost all in a zombified state is odd, since this is a cultural trait from Haiti, in the West Indies, not that of the East Indies. And, of course, amongst the first to die in the film are the nerdy guy with eyeglasses, the black sailor, and the Chinese. Who survives? The Great White Hunters! I don't know what sort of statement Jackson thought he was making, but perhaps New Zealand is so far removed from the political realities of today that he just didn't know he was being racist with such depictions and narratives. I guess the Maoris have had it much better down under than we were led to believe.... Overall, this version of Kong is not bad, and at times, quite good, and you'll leave the theater with a bit of a buzz.	3.0	Middling	2008-09-13	1	0	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1U45RTE16447K	CrackerBarrel	"everything about this film is escapist adventure thrills and excitement EXCEPT......that CONFUSING/FRUSTRATING ""cut"" between Kong's capture and the first scene (back) in New York City. from the opening credits through the entire Skull Island roller-coaster you will not find a more enjoyable cinema experience. the effects are brilliant, the pacing breath-taking (not counting the first 30 minutes of important ""background build-up"") and the interplay between the characters (including Kong) are FULLY realized. TO HIS CREDIT Peter Jackson manages NOT to succumb to ""cartooning"" Kong. there are NO ""Harry and the Hendersons"" faces or goofy grins or superfluous facial expressions/tears. Kong remains a ""real"" (albeit 30 foot) gorilla to the end. the emotion of his love for Ann is STILL obvious (and wonderfully potrayed). BUT THEN there is ""THAT CUT""...that artery-severing KNIFE-SLICE that leaves you thinking that you missed about 20-25 minutes of story! for over 2 hours we get to know our characters (and the dynamics of their inter-twining relationships) quite intimately. SUDDENLY MOST of that ends...and i mean SUDDENLY. Minutes later the film starts to wind to its dramatic Empire State Building finale. it felt like 20 minutes of film had been lost (showing Kong's transport to America and his subsequent humiliation as [basically] a circus/side-show act...longing for his beloved Ann and feeling defeated without her). EVEN WITH ITS FAULTS this is STILL a ROUSING cinematic adventure. the Skull Island escapades are destined to rest amongst the all-time great cinematic thrill sequences and Peter Jackson's love for Kong is evident from the opening scenes to the last frame of film (especially poignant are the moments shared between Kong and Ann on the cliffs at sunset). Stellar performances from the lovely Naomi Watts, the talented Adrian Brody, and (with a few eyebrow-raising exceptions) Jack Black. the performer who deserves the MOST accolades is (of course) Andy Serkis who pulled double-duty as Kong AND the entertaining Lumpy The Cook. i think the Oscars needs to add a special category to aknowledge the gifts of ""motion capture/voice"" artists like Serkis (his work as Smeagol in LOTR certainly deserved such aknowledgement). ALL IN ALL....an impressive movie going experience destined to ONLY get better on the inevitible ""Extended Director's Cut DVD"" (whenever that is released).

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	The story of King Kong is so simple that a 7-minute miniepisode of The Simpsons tells as much story as Peter Jackson's 3-hour movie.  But we all know the story anyway - Jackson's challenge is to bring modern filmmaking techniques to the story and to give us something we've never seen before.  Certainly, his recreation of 1930's NYC is impressive, and his Kong is amazing.  Unfortunately, that is where my praise for the film ends (except to mention Jack Black's performance, which was a treat to watch).There are a lot of details that I could go into as to why I consider Jackson's film to be failure.  None of these would be fatal on their own, and in fact most would be quickly forgiven in an engaging film.  But therein lies the problem - this film is not engaging.  In fact, it's somewhat dull.  This is not the director that brought out such wonderful and subtle performances in the LotR trilogy but rather the director of B-level horror films like Braindead.  There is simply too much action over too long a time, and the brain tunes out.  The story is made to showcase the abilities of the special effects, rather than the effects serving the needs of the story.Even then the effects are not the best I've seen.  How this film won an Oscar when Star Wars III wasn't even nominated is offensive!  As I mentioned, Kong himself is very impressive, but nothing else in the film matches that achievement.  This would not be a problem if the filmakers were aiming for a stylised cartoon-like vision.  But Kong's realism serves to highlight the inadequacies of the rest of the film.  Most damaging are the scenes on the water (see: Master and Commander for how a boat should look at sea!), the dinosaurs (that are no better than Spielberg's in Jurassic Park, now 12 years old!), and the actors' performances (who look like they are staring off into space rather than looking at something).But basically it all comes down to the fact that there is too little story and no reason to tell it.  The scenes on Skull Island seem endless, and endlessly similar, as we see dinosaurs attacking the ship's crew, then fighting Kong, then fighting Kong some more, then attacking Ann Darrow, then fighting Kong, then.... but you get the idea.  Oddly, the first hour (setting up the expedition) was widely derided by the critics, but is really the only part of the film worth watching.This DVD edition is actually quite nice, with the expected full-spread of extras.  The extras might even be better than those on the LotR special editions - certainly they are tighter and more eye-catching for the casual viewer.  The film looks and (especially) sounds great.  Too bad there is no real reason to own the film.  Or even to see it.	2.0	A story to service the effects, not effects to service a story	2006-06-20	11	9	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"While the original movie of ""King Kong"" will always matter, I believe this is the version that all people who enjoy this story will turn to.  It is so much richer that the film has its own kind of majesty.  It isn't just a monster or a beauty-and-the-beast kind of tale.  This version is a metaphor for man's overestimation of himself and his abilities balanced with a story on the power of nature both as an external environment and as an inner drive.This vast movie has three large sections.  First, is the setup in New York in the 1930s.  Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) is a down and out vaudeville performer with dreams of being in a stage production by her favorite writer, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody).  Carl Denhem (Jack Black) is an almost-but-never-been movie director/producer is desperate to make a film and finally make it, but his backers want to sell off the reels he has as stock footage.  His female lead has backed out and he has to find a replacement.  Denhem and Darrow happen to meet and he talks her into doing the film.  Denhem has conned everyone, but everyone really knows they are being conned, but in the hearts want to participate anyway.  Even Driscoll manages to get caught up into Denhem monomania.The second portion takes place on Kong's home island.  It must be vast to support the huge life forms and the huge canyons and cliffs.  But reality isn't the point here.  The inhabitants of the island are truly savages and are decadent descendents or interlopers of the people who built the ancient wall and buildings.  The battles Kong has here to demonstrate his strength and supremacy go far beyond anything the first movie offered.  Of course, it is vital to notice the creatures in this natural jungle versus the mechanical creatures in the human jungle later in the film.  Be careful with young children, a couple of the battles with some of the fauna get to be pretty creepy.There are several key developments for the main characters here that matter later in the movie, but the key relationship is between Darrow and Kong.  She is a better survivor here in a particularly vicious nature than she was in the city, but Kong's protection gives her enough time to appreciate his majesty.  Driscoll and Darrow develop a mutual, but unstated affection and it is Driscoll who goes back to rescue her from Kong and the jungle.The third portion has Kong completely out of his environment and chained for the amusement of chuckleheads, well-dressed chuckleheads, mind you.  When Kong is presented with a fake Darrow, he decides he has to find the real one and breaks free, to Denhem's ruin.  He falls from the success for which he had always dreamed and schemed to the man who unleashed a monster on New York.  After Kong and Darrow find each other there are some touching scenes of mutual affection that culminate in the classic scene atop the Empire State Building - a stylized version of it.  The biplane battle echoing one of the encounters on the island leads finally to Kong falling from his final mountaintop.The movie is a visual feast and tells this story with sincerity and conviction.  It offers up the substance the story has rather than sensationalizing it and I think that is a real treat.  I enjoyed it very much and recommend it to you."	5.0	I think this will be THE version of the King Kong story for decades to come	2006-04-21	11	8	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AIC7J32QZY2KF	Craig Moller	First of all I want to say is that King Kong is visually stunning through out the whole movie, from the 1920s New York to Skull Island and to the monsters on the island and especially Kong who looks stunning on the screen. One question that bothers me is that how the Academy Award Winner Peter Jackson came up with this brillant movie and managed to finnish it I don't know.Yes, there have been previous King Kong movies but this one is pure movie greatness and delivers where the others have failed. But where they fail is where Peter Jackson's take shines. There is an actual relationship between Kong and Ann, we actually understand why Ann cares so much for him. While Kong would try to impress her with roars and beating his chest, Ann would perform her vaudeville antics (to Kong's.. and ultimately the audience's delight). It is their shared moments of joy that solidify an unusual bond of friendship between Ann and Kong. Ann perhaps realizes that she is Kong's only friend, and hence his entire world.The cast was superb, with Jack Black (probably his only serious role ever) as Carl, Adrien Brody and the beautiful Nioami Watts, followed by an excellent supporting cast which delivered by making the movie believable.King Kong in my opinion is one the most beautiful movies ever made, where Jackson takes you to another world and puts you on a sometimes frightning adventure that is also heart warming at the same time. This shows just how great Peter Jackson is at being a director.	5.0	Fantasic!	2008-10-24	2	2	0

He captures the moral message in how the human race will take mother natures beauty & selfishly detroy it. To me Kong is a metaphor for the planet earth! Anyway Peter Jackson takes us on a visual & emotional thrillride before punching us all in the gutt with an ending that we all new was comeing but we just didn't want it to come. Kinda like watching a repeat of the 86 world series & already knowing the outcome but just hopeing the ball this time around won't go between Bill Buckner's legs.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A77184QJM3PM	"C. Tolley ""Chris Tolley"""	Wow. That's one word that leaps to mind here. I finally watched Peter Jackson's King Kong for the first time, and I feel like I've been slapped around some. I've heard some great and not-so great comments made about this film, and I noticed the box office, while very healthy, wasn't quite up to industry predictions. I waited to see the film on DVD, where I could pay close attention to detail and to the story. The detail is amazing. Depression-era New York is vividly re-created here, and Skull Island is a nightmare made real. Kong himself, the main lead, is astounding. Credit goes again to the magicians at Weta Digital. They are this generations Industrial Light and Magic. The story, though well-worn and retold, is very well played. The films length, one major drawback according to many people I've spoken with, really wasn't an issue with me. I felt the pace moved quite well, tho somewhat sluggishly at first. the tempo kicks up quite a bit with the arrival at Skull Island, and doesn't really stop from there. In fact, some sequences were almost too intense for comfort, inducing some pronounced squirming from yours truly. The scenes I found to be truly perfect were the scenes involving Ann Darrow and Kong alone. The sequence in the park in New York, on the frozen lake, was wonderful. You could feel the playfulness of Kong, and the happiness of Ann, so acutely here, which is tragically balanced by the end sequence atop the Empire State building. The casting was superb for the part of Ann Darrow. Naomi Watts does on amazing job here, conveying so much through her eyes and motions. Jack Black was an interesting choice, and he does a creditable job. Adrien Brody really doesn't have that meaty a role, and does what he can with it, so no real complaints there. I wondered if Peter Jackson was slightly off to go after a legendary tale like King Kong. I know it was his favorite movie as a child, and his real stimulus to be a film-maker, but King Kong has been retold before, and the 1976 remake was not very good. However, Mr.Jackson has re-imagined Kong in a new, fresh way, and breathed life back into the old story. This was really first-rate story-telling using all the latest technology, without the tech overwhelming the basic tale. What an experience this film is.	5.0	Nearly Overwhelming	2006-04-02	3	2	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2RLK9KKVGEETZ	"C. Tsao ""Seaview1"""	Let's be clear about this epic retelling of 'beauty and the beast'.  If you didn't care for the original 1933 horror classic, King Kong, it is doubtful you will warm to this mega version.  That being said, this update is a marvelous, big production that entertains and excites without sacrificing any of its emotional substance.  As escapist fare with heart, the new King Kong has blockbuster written all over it, and in this case that's a good thing, a very good thing indeed.It is Depression era in New York City where Carl Denham (Jack Black), a frustrated movie director, gambles that he can make a hit film on a remote island.  Denham happens upon Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), an unemployed actress/comedienne, and casts her as his star.  With some deception, he embarks on his filmic voyage with reluctant screenwriter, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody).  Arriving at uncharted Skull Island, the film crew ventures inland and is confronted by unfriendly natives who later kidnap Darrow as a human sacrifice.  As Driscoll leads the ship's crew to rescue Ann, a gigantic, fierce gorilla called Kong approaches and seizes her.  Driscoll and the others are in hot pursuit through a prehistoric land where they are attacked by gigantic creatures.  Kong fights his way through carnivorous dinosaurs with his female captive in hand until they reach his mountain top lair.  Kong is a vicious animal, but he also reveals a gentler side when tantalized by Ann's comedic and athletic talents.  The two begin to form an unlikely bond.  When Driscoll manages to rescue Ann, an enraged Kong chases them until Denham tranquilizes the beast.  Now a major attraction on Broadway, Kong is a prisoner until he breaks free to wreak havoc while searching for Ann.  When the two are reunited, it culminates atop the Empire State Building as Kong is attacked by warplanes in a heartrending finale.Does the new Kong justify the hype and expectations?  Yes, it is the complete moviegoing experience.  There are thrills, spectacle, humor, and a sense of heroic adventure, which are rare even in the post-Indiana Jones era.  It would take the superhuman effort of a director like Peter Jackson (and writers Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh), who had just completed the legendary Lord of the Rings trilogy, to tackle this project.  This is an old fashioned film that stays closely to the original script.  That Jackson takes his time in quieter moments to develop his characters and never stumbles when the action starts is truly amazing.  Just when you think our heroes are safe, a new danger pops up to keep you at the edge of your seat. He is a master showman of creative, funhouse perils, and when he does things, bigger is better.  He re-imagines legendary sequences from the original and takes them to new heights.  When Kong fights a dinosaur, he battles not two but three dinosaurs in a clash of the titans!  Kong's rampage on Broadway reminds you of the Piccadilly Circus sequence in An American Werewolf in London.  When he is reunited with Ann, the two communicate through unspoken language.  It is a moment of truth that Jackson films with an eerie beauty.  You just know Jackson is a romantic as he sets up his dawn raid at the Empire State Building and gives his biggest star a great sendoff that compares favorably to the original.As for Kong himself, the (CG) computer-generated effects are phenomenal as the broadest of emotions and the tiniest of mannerisms and facial nuances (like blinking his eyes) are eloquently captured.  Imagine that, pathos from a CG creation!Literally a far cry from original star Fay Wray, Naomi Watts gives the best performance in emoting true feelings and playing off her giant ape convincingly.  Adrien Brody displays the necessary heroics in a role that doesn't demand much more.  Jack Black was bold casting, but his character doesn't always work.  Although entertaining, his Denham is more calculating and morally ambiguous than actor Robert Armstrong's 1933 depiction.Technically the film is a marvel, and the art direction and special effects meld seamlessly together so that it is impossible to tell one from the other.  Rarely do the effects look artificial except in the dinosaur stampede.  The stunning visuals and fluid camera work are like eye candy, and many scenes are shot with a fresh perspective or point of view.  Some of the action scenes are almost too much overkill, but Jackson gets away with it because his other scenes are so impressive.At three hours running time, it moves fairly well.  It takes an hour to get to Kong, but when he does appear, the film becomes one big, nonstop chase.  There are brief lulls, but credit Jackson with not rushing to an action scene and instead savoring the quiet moments that establish the most important relationship in the story.  What's satisfying in the relationship between Kong and Ann is that it is one of companionship and love without the overt sexuality of the original.There are a couple of unsettling moments when Denham confronts the natives and a spider pit sequence that could be nightmarish for children.  This pit sequence pays homage to a scene that was cut from the original and expands on the possibilities in nasty ways.  If you thought Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's insects were creepy, watch out!Jackson wows his audiences with his talent for managing enormous spectacles and imbuing them with humanity.  This film verifies his prowess as one of the most gifted directors of his generation.  Audiences looking for adventure of the highest order will find a lot to enjoy here.  It's been three-quarters of a century since the original Kong wowed `em, and it's a safe bet that no one will wow `em  like Peter Jackson for another 75 years!	5.0	KING KONG-Still the Champ	2005-12-15	4	3	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	"King Kong is Peter Jackson's epic, mega-budget, fanboy love letter to the film that inspired him to become a movie director in the first place. Clocking in at double the running time of the original, Jackson's film is an ambitious juggernaut of a movie that, like his The Lord of the Rings films, is epic in scale and scope and yet still has that personal touch. One of the common complaints leveled at the movie is its bloated running time and this new version is even longer but this is more than self-indulgence on Jackson's part. He spends more time developing his characters, their motivations and their relationships. Even the excessive and extensive dinosaur sequences in the second act are there for a reason.Like the extended versions of the Lord of the Rings films, Kong is spread out over two discs with extras sprinkled over them and a third disc with an in-depth look at the making of this epic feature.The first disc features an audio commentary by co-writer/director Peter Jackson and co-writer/producer Philippa Boyens. In a nice touch, Jackson makes it a point not to talk about any material covered in the various documentaries or in the production diaries. So, this track isn't bogged down with technical information but with more of an emphasis on how they tried to capture the spirit of the historical period, character motivation, references to the original Kong and filming anecdotes. This is a solid, chatty track packed with loads of information and told in an engaging way that really conveys how much of a labour of love it was for Jackson.Also included are 16 deleted scenes that total 46 minutes. There are optional introductions to each scene by Jackson who puts them into the context of the movie and briefly explains why they were cut. Best of all, he explains that with this extended cut he didn't simply throw all of it back into the movie but made choices and explains them here.""The Eighth Blunder of the World"" is an 18 minute blooper reel of the cast goofing around on the set and flubbing their lines (especially potty mouth Jack Black).""The Missing Production Diary"" was not included on any previous DVDs and documents shoot day #59. The actors get to see footage that they just shot on video monitors so that they can adjust their performance. The cast begin to get ""addicted"" to watching themselves in this amusing extra.""A Night in Vaudeville"" features uncut footage that they shot of the vaudeville performances including audition footage and archival film that they used as a basis.""King Kong Homage"" juxtaposes scenes and lines from the original with their verbatim recreation in Jackson's film. We also see some of the exact references to the original and also inclusion of props from the film that came from Jackson's personal collection.The second disc features ""Pre-Visualization Animatics"" for four scenes with optional music from the movie. This extra allows you to see scenes as they were originally conceived via computer animation.""The Present"" is an amusing short film that the cast created for Jackson's birthday. It started off as a simple idea, a funny goof but, as Andy Serkis explains, it got more elaborate with an actual storyline as Jackson's present exchanges many hands on its way to him.Also included are three trailers.""Weta Collectibles"" takes us on a brief tour of the elaborate sculptures for the creatures that inhabit Skull Island and how some of them have since been transformed into finely crafted collectibles for fans.The third disc features an in-depth look at the film entitled ""Recreating the Eighth Wonder, the Making of King Kong,"" an eight-part documentary that you can watch in its entirety or its individual segments. This doc goes on to take an in-depth look at the pre-production phase as various crew members explain how they came right off making the last Rings movies with virtually the same crew but not as much time to prepare. One highlight is Jackson and Naomi Watts' meeting with Fay Wray, which was an extremely emotional day for the director. He was deeply saddened by her death in 2004 as he had hoped to have her do a cameo in his film. Amazingly, there is little repetition from the production diaries in these expertly crafted featurettes.Finally, there are the ""Conceptual Design Video Galleries,"" montages set to music of sketches, paintings and artwork from the 1996 attempt to make Kong, the Venture, Skull Island, New York City and Kong. It's interesting to see how close the film resembles a lot of the art, especially the Venture, Skull Island and New York City."	5.0	An exhaustive and extensive Deluxe Edition!	2006-11-29	10	8	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2IVO0FC7O8GDA	C. White	Some other reviewers who realized this film is as bad as it is pointed out its many, many flaws, so I won't reiterate them.  Suffice it to say, it's not the real King Kong story (girl *loves* ape?  Right. . .)  And the cartoon physics were so over the top as to make the movie into a true cartoon (except it wasn't funny -- at least not intentially so -- well, perhaps the whole film was a bad joke).  Sad.  Lord of the Rings was truly exceptional.  This film is a parody at best. To recap: little characterization (at least that made sense), no depth, unbelievable motives (again, girl *loves* ape?  Sheesh!), and no attempt to make the action scenes believable.  What a disappointment!	2.0	Huge ape, huge dissapointment	2006-11-04	26	7	19
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A95MF5FWFK15N	C. Williams	I admit to being a Kong fanatic and I love anything to do with the big hairy ape, so I just had to go and see Peter Jackson's version. It was such an emotional experience I was in tears by the end of it. It was just so well constructed and realized so perfectly you can't help but get swept away in the grand spectacle.Me, I always complain that movies are too short, I was pleasantly surprised at how long Kong was. It's rare you get a big blockbuster that takes time to develop its characters and focuses on the background as well as on the action scenes too. This film does it wonderfully, and though the pace may lag at times and one or two of the dinosaurs look a little funky, it's Kong and Ann's relationship that makes it so good to watch.King Kong is realized perhaps in the best way this time round, as a proper animal that you can actually believe in. The '33 kong had some good FX work but it looks a little dated now, and the '76 Kong had some really dodgy suit work, but with this film you get a real physcial animal. The amount of subtlety and depth in Kong's performance is amazing as he and Ann journey through skull island and new york so you really feel for him when he falls from the Empire State Building, much like the original, this is one of the few films that ever made me cry. Peter Jackson has taken the wonder and magic of that first movie and just supercharged it, creating something incredible.I hope that there's an extended version of this, a few scenes were actually cut out. Bring on the ten hour movies, that's what i say.Seriously though, if you're looking for a real epic experience, a movie that is above the rest, Kong is still the king.	5.0	I N C R E D I B L E	2006-02-04	7	4	3

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	I have not seen any of the Lord of the Rings movies and probably never will, just not my thing, but I was all ears when I heard that Jackson was remaking the legendary Kong film which, in my opinion was due for an update.  So here I sit in the theater and everyone is quiet and the film starts and the film ends and I'm left with this feeling of pure happiness.  It was the most fun I've had in the theater in a LONG time.  I mean, don't get me wrong, this year hasn't been without some great movies, but this was a little of everything...it was funny, emotional, dramatic, creepy and moving all at the same time.  Watts was great as Ann, Brody was decent, Black was great and KONG WAS FREAKING AMAZING...he was the best actor in the bunch.  He was funning and emotional and damn near brought everyone to tears.  Don;t listen to people who dog it or say it was too long...it was just right.  It did the origional MUCH DESERVED JUSTICE and stands alone as one of the best epics to grace the screen in a long time.  CGI was amazing, script was tight and the directing was brilliant.  Jackson should get a nod, maybe a win...SEE THIS MOVIE!	5.0	One of the BEST remakes of all time!	2005-12-27	5	2	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	APOGXH3A74CM3	Damian P. Gadal	This review is for the King Kong (Extended Version) (Amazon Instant Video)It's be a while since I saw this in the theater, but remember really liking it, so I purchased this for home streaming and decided to get the extended version.  I love it.  As the story unfolds you get lots and lots of edge of your seat scenes, with lots of tension and gripping action.I don't think the that the scenes between Ann Darrow and Kong are too much or too many, in fact they help the story to unfold and provide some charming relief, comic at times, to the action, which is much needed.Peter Jackson and crew has created a lush and beautiful world, be it Skull Island or 1930's New York.  It's a world you can immerse yourself in and enjoy as the tragic tale of Kong is told.The cast also did an outstanding job, which I didn't think the first time I saw this.  After seeing it again, I've changed my mind and think the cast played out their parts perfectly.I'd recommend the extended version for folks who get pulled into this type of movie, so that they can sit back and get lost in the world of Kong.	5.0	Kong is King	2012-08-04	2	2	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AILBDL6ATVDCJ	"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL"""	"When the movie King Kong first starts off, I found myself mesmerized by sets, intrigued with the dialogue, and wondering if the casting and directing could keep up such great momentum.  The answer is NO!The first part of this film is so fantastic that I have recommended people only watch the first half and then just pull the DVD from the player.Now don't get me wrong.  I don't think this film was a complete flop.  It is just a bit overrated, in my OPINION.Being tossed around by a giant gorilla can not be an easy job, yet Naomi Watts (as Ann Darrow) pulls it off brilliantly.  Her performance throughout the entire film is truly amazing and worth praise.Jack Black is also brilliant in the first half of this film, too.The second half of this film, starting with the dinosaurs are scared and running scene and ending with the most boring finish to a thriller (yeah, sure, it's suppose to be a love story - whatever) movie ever shot, is such a complete letdown that I would never actually purchase the DVD.Peter Jackson directed the most incredible trilogy ever - ""The Lord of the Rings.""  That doesn't make him invincible.  This film proves that.  The second half of King Kong is nothing but a computer animated ""Fear Factor"" episode with an extremely boring ending that lacked any suspense, interesting dialogue, or creative input.It really is a shame.  This film could have been so much more.See ya next review!"	3.0	Great Start, Bad Finish!	2006-04-25	4	0	4

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1BB83EC6D7LTA	Daniel Barak	first i will state that i am NOT objective, as a result of my 15 year long expectation to see the classic kong redone with modern technologies, my absolute contempt for the de-laurentiis sacrilege, and a life-long fetish of dinosaurs, especially from the old school that began with jules verne and sir arthur conan doyle, the apothesis of which king kong is.i am in awe of what we have here, an epic tribute to that sub-genre in adventure fiction, all too rare in this day and age, with gothic touches reminiscent of fritz lang, murnau, and coketau. the world of kong is extremely well planned, and the brontosaur stampade is everything i ever wanted to see . kong himself is a titan while carl denham is indeed a promethean figure. the only sour note for me was the exclusion of some scenes from the original trailer, and the speculation about dinosaurs filmed but also excluded. which brings me to the issue of cuts: even those who believe the film is too long, will only benefit from a LONGER dvd version.yes, LONGER, since not only will we get more exciting scenes, but also a fuller and richer plot, which would bring us closer to the spirit of the classic adventure stories. so, please opt for more rather than less in this film which is a dream come true for me as well as meny others, i hope.	5.0	five stars are definitely not enough!	2006-01-02	4	3	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A22TL53EPV6LII	Daniel V.	I've never seen the classic of King Kong, so I didn't know what to expect. It seemed interesting with everybody saying this movie is very good and long. Well I love those type of movies, especially long ones, so I decided to watch this one.This movie has a very good story to it and the cast is just perfect. Naomi Watts does a wonderful job in her part, along with the other characters. The special effects were awesome and they did a wonderful job in making the movie seem so realistic. I hate those wildlife bugs, so I had to look away for a second when all these huge insects started coming. This movie actually takes place on a island. This is where King Kong lives, and lives a lonely life. Throughout the movie you'll get to know who King Kong is all about and you'll most likely feel sorry for him at the end of the movie. I know I did.Overall, I find this movie very good. If you're into long and adventure movies, then I suggest that you pick this DVD up. Even if you're not, at least give it a rent. I'll garauntee you that you won't be disappointed.	5.0	Wow, a great movie!	2006-06-11	13	10	3

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1ASBHVJR8XETO	Dan Mohr	"My basic analogy for what Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' is like is: what if you took a blender, and tossed in grilled hamburger, pickles, chocolate ice cream, ketchup, cheese, wasabi, vodka, peanut butter, guacamole, orange juice, mashed potatoes, maple syrup, hot chili peppers, one Mountain Dew, four espressos, and then you set your blender on 'HIGH' and ground all this stuff up together, until you came out with a big, frothy, gloopy, stinking porridge of stuff that might've been tasty on its own, but now makes absolutely no aesthetic sense at all!Case in point: what possible sense does it make to have a violently repugnant scene of men being eaten alive by surreally huge, slimy, grotesque worms with fangs in one scene - and then cut to the next scene, where the big gorilla and his lovely human damsel-in-distress recline together to watch the ultimate Hallmark-card sunset together in some sort of 'romantic idyll'? Way to develop the dramatic/romantic atmosphere through scene structure, Mr. Jackson! I honestly can't remember another movie having more jarring & outright ludicrous shifts-of-tone since David Lynch's 'Wild At Heart.'I think this would be *the perfect* movie for students in film schools to be given, to learn the 'art of editing;' their assignment would be: Take this bloated, unruly behemoth of a movie, and chop out ONE WHOLE HOUR of the super-extraneous, pointless, redundant & downright annoying material. Because the fact of the matter is, ladies & gents, perhaps in the entire history of movies has there never been a more obvious case of a potentially impressive and enjoyable 2-hour-long movie lurking inside a swollen, obnoxious, post-Oscar-winning-monomanaical, ""everything I write and shoot is golden,"" director's-head-up-his-derriere 3-hour (or 4-hour, depending on your DVD) pseudo-epic.The movie is far from worthless - but it wouldn't be so infuriating if it was worse.  The production design and special effects are mostly brilliant, and Kong's final scaling of, and fall from, the Empire State Building is very satisfying (with exception to the completely implausible choreography of the human characters throughout the sequence).  Unfortunately, as beautifully as Kong has been digitally realized, the story completely fails on any recognizable human level, mainly because all of the characters seem wheeled out of the movie studio's decades-old Closet of Stock Cliches (the screenwriters and director haven't even dusted them off - they LIKE all that dust).  Naomi Watts brings zip and life to whatever she does, and of all the actors present her generic down-on-her-luck-flapper fares the best.  The incredibly gifted Adrien Brody, so extraordinarily compelling and heartbreaking in Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist', brings an understated charm to his underwritten and underdeveloped Depression-era Broadway playwright; his character's relevance becomes increasingly lost in the din and dank of Skull Island, and is all but completely discarded by the time Kong reaches the island of New York.  And Jack Black as the opportunistic-filmmaker-turned-totally-craven-businessman acts like he just brushed up on (but didn't bother to finish) his Intro-To-Theatre-101 Cliff Notes; Black's marvelous comic potential, which always has the possibility of hitting some wickedly enjoyable high notes ala Jack Nicholson, is used by Peter Jackson for less than five minutes of this entire dreary endeavor. (Black and his supporting cast basically spend all their time amateurishly over-emulating in this Tin Pan Alley action-adventure soap opera, desperately trying to bring some life to the endless and interminable procession of lifeless scenes in Jackson's & Fran Walsh's & Phillipa Boyen's shrieking-for-rewrites screenplay.)From his truly-worthy-of-the-title-of-""masterpiece"" 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' to 'King Kong', Peter Jackson, The Director As Superstar, has gone from emulating a masterly David Lean of 'Lawrence of Arabia' to the insufferable artistic egotism of a Michael Cimino circa 'Heaven's Gate,' only with a zillion geeky fanboys around the world willing to shill out an extra $20 to obsessively salivate over his every passing thought and mundane remark on bonus supplementary DVDs (which lately seem to be just as important a concern, if not more so, to Jackson than the actual movie which he's working on).  I sincerely hope in the coming years of his career that Jackson does not become a prisoner of his own multi-million-dollar FX and art departments at his rightly honored WETA Workshop in New Zealand, and instead gets back to doing what he does best: making movies featuring compelling human characters and stories.  His earlier masterpiece, 'Heavenly Creatures' (1994), one of the very finest movies of the last 20 years, was made for around 1/100th of the budget of 'King Kong,' and has 1,000 times more genuinely human emotional impact, not to mention truly audience-invested entertainment value.  (It would be most heartening if Jackson follows through with his tentative plans to scale his operation down & adapt Alice Sebold's terrifying modern literary classic 'The Lovely Bones' for the screen, because at the moment there is no living movie director who is more in need of a stupefyingly-overwrought-big-budget-blockbuster aesthetic enema.)My girlfriend's review of Jackson's 'King Kong' was simple enough: ""That movie was a pain in my a** - literally & figuratively."""	2.0	Yet Another Decent 2-Hour Movie Lost Inside A 3-Hour Pseudo-Epic	2006-06-19	9	7	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3DGVB3T5QJNRE	Danny G.	I realize Edgar Rice Burroughs' dopey King Kong story was written for  children & a young teen audience. I know it's supposed to be trite and two-dimensional! What I didn't expect was the blatant racism, the non-stop killing & gore, the pathological narcissism by one of the main characters, and the 1950's style monster movie drudgery, at the hands of an alleged genius, Mr. Jackson of Lord Of The Rings fame! I literally trusted that he would not pander to American society's lowest common denominator in order to make a buck.What a disappointment! I'd love to have been a fly on the wall when they did focus groups before making this movie. They must have impaneled a bunch of immature teenagers without any regard to either young children or grown-ups, which is a real shame!I was also a bit shocked by the disgusting racism shown towards a very dark skinned tribal community. It's now 2005, why were indigenous people portrayed as dangerous maniacs, and downright evil? This is a rather ugly stereotype the Western world has been carrying around for many centuries. To this very day, indigenous people are being run-off their land, or killed, because they stand in the way of the almighty dollar! Some situations are so extreme that organizations like Survival International from the United Kingdom, and Cultural Survival, out of Boston area, solely exist so this kind of mindless brutality will finally come to an end.This is a teachable moment. I hope Mr. Jackson makes amends for profiting off of a very White author's terribly misguided, and hateful, fantasies. Perhaps it's time to get Howard Zinn on the phone!The violence and gore caught me by surprise to the point it got rather tedious, and annoying! Besides being preposterous, for example, I don't care how strong a vine is, it's simply not going to hold onto a squirming, multiple ton dinosaur!  There was also a very disturbing message - that nature in its pristine wild state is, by design, an extremely dangerous place. Which, of course, needs to civilized by mostly White men!The attack of the giant cave bugs obviously reflects our childhood fears of the dark. But back in the real world most cave systems are occupied by some of the most unusually fragile endangered species on earth! Besides being fragile, they are blind, and totally harmless! How ironic! If this movie deters a single vandal from damaging an underground cave system, then hooray. But what most children, and plenty of older folks now will think is that caves are creepy, bad places instead of  biological treasure troves worthy of badly needed government protection!I could go on forever about why this film stinks. To sum it all up: The young child sitting behind me was constantly asking his father questions because he was trying to cope with the trash that was unfolding before his eyes. I had the good sense to walk out at the two hour mark. I dearly hope the boy's father had enough sense to do the same!	1.0	This Film Is So Vile, It Literally Made Me Feel Sick!	2005-12-27	28	7	21
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AXBC2RN6RBSJG	Danny Jerry	"This movie looks like a videogame. The musical score is boring and forgettable. Naomi Watts is far too old for the role. Jack Black is a horrible actor who does nothing but bug his eyes out and whisper all the time. Several extranious characters are added early in the film and then just vanish for no reason at all. Several sequences were so corney I almost laughed out loud wile others were simply mean spirited. The dinosaur sequences were imitations of those boring Jurassic Park films. The hero looks like one of the Ritz brothers. The characters were so poorly developed I'm still not sure if they were good, evil or just misguided and even the good guys were basically unlikable. The plot strayed too far from the original on several occasions. The movie ran way too long and was boring at times (""if you shake it an hour will fall out"").

I also thought the price for the instant video of it was correct.  In general I think of other instant videos were in this price range more would be sold.  the fact that most streamed instant vidoes are $9.99 a price that is not that far away from the cost of the DVD's that are higher quality makes it hard to justify the cost. If the aveage cost of streamed videos was more in the $4.99 range I know I would buy a lot more.	5.0	love this film	2013-03-04	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AGESMCP6EPVZ3	Dante 360	I Just realized that this film is really a parody of the original. It stars a funny comedian, Jack Black, who bugs out his eyes and makes funny faces. Funny!!The Hero is a skinny funny looking guy too. Hilarious!!! The film is full of funny moments too, Like when you expect Kong to see Ann on stage and its someone else!!! Its a spoof of the original!! I get it. It even has tongue-in-cheek comedy ,like the moment when Kong is going wild in the street and stops when he sees Ann standing there with the lights around her, and its real corney and we all groan.HA!!HAA!!!! I get it! I get jokes!! Hey, I just noticed. Kong and the dinosaurs and the whole movie look like one big cartoon. and cartoons are funny. Right?  Never seen Buggs Bunny?Casting an actress who is old enough to be Ann Darrows mother has to constitute some sort of joke. Doesn't it? And the plot is a reverse of the original. The girl falls in love with the ape.  Its spoofing the original King Kong. SEE!!!!Maybe Peter Jackson should stick to elves. Comedy just isn't his thing. Maybe Blake Edwards or Mel Brooks should have directed. Hey, didn't Mel do that remake of The Fly. Thats how you remake 'em right.	2.0	OH, I GET IT! A PARODY OF THE ORIGINAL!!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2HII4U9WQ0XUV	"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep"""	"Peter Jackson's lard-a**ed, amped-up, super-spectacular ""King Kong"" goes the distance in answering the age-old question: Where does a 25 foot, 5-ton Gorilla sit?Answer: anywhere he damn well pleases.Even if that means getting his hairy a** shot off the top of the Empire State Building by a squadron of Army Air Corps biplanes, all amped up on pure aerial fury and a boatload of Giant Monkey-hatred. Yaaaar! You thump dat chest, big fella, we got gatling guns!There's really nothing that's gonna tax your brain in Peter Jackson's Minimum Opus, and it's all pretty much by the book: Girl gets tired of eating in soup kitchen, Girl goes to Skull Island, Ape meets Girl, Ape falls for Girl, Girl flees to New York, Ape takes an even bigger fall. Lucky for New Yorkers Kong didn't have a high fiber diet.In the end it's an oddly muted, curiously intimate Spectacle Movie: all the juicy moments are in the long slow-burn shots, where Kong (the inimitable Andy Serkis all spruced up via CGI into yowling, scowling, frowning, brooding uber-Simian) and ingenue Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts, whose lips launched a thousand ships) share some girl-on-ape quality time atop the high places of the two most fearsome islands on Earth, Skull & Manhattan.For all the sound and fury, ""Kong"" isn't as spectacular as it wants to be: when it stumbles, it's because Peter Jackson is trying too hard. Take the dinosaur tumble sequence---what the H*ll was that all about?It's just freakish, astoundingly goofy, totally out of place and tone: not for a single second did the sequence suspend my disbelief---wait a sec, you got a bunch of fat Manhattanites doing the 15-minute-mile beneath the thousand-ton feet of a herd of hopped-up dinos, and you're telling the whole bunch of 'em ain't gonna get squished?Whatever. ""Kong"" is intermittently fun, occasionally astounding, and often spectacular, provided you check your cynicism at the door. WETA-New Zealand's giant monkey is an astonishing master-work, a coup of theatrical art for the ages: he has a helluva lot more charisma, pathos, and screen presence than rival Jack Driscoll (the ugly Adrien Brody, playing the world's most godawful playwright). If you're not jumping up and down in your seat and rooting for Kong to knock those pesky, b*tch-a** bi-planes outta the sky, you're not breathing.And let's cut to the guts of the deal: the duel at the top of the World took my breath away, and, frankly, there's nothing as delicious, and ghoulish (though Jackson could have added a little more splatter!), than the nasty spider-pit sequence, which underscored this point: there are far nastier things on Skull Island than King Kong.And the acting? It works just fine: Naomi Watts (Darrow) could just purse her lips all days and it would be alright by me. Jack Black (Denham) smacks of the theater and a little brimstone: he gets the balance between the sulphur of unfettered greed and the wide-eyed wonder of a spoiled child. Brody is, well, Brody: ugly, gawky, and puzzling.In all of his incarnations---particularly in the unloved 1976 version, which is superior in dignity and terror to this outing---Kong has always struck me as a fascinating figure: a loner, a kind of outcast. Perhaps he is King of Terrors to the cowering natives---who in Jackson's opus are more horrific than Kong---but he's more of a sad, brooding, wandering nobleman, cursed by fate, the last of his kind, apparently---more at war than at home with his fellow weird, hungry denizens of Skull Island.In the end, Jackson succeeds because he gets his arms around the central truth of the Kong legend: the King of Skull Island is lonely, just like the rest of us.Flawed, goofy, encumbered by its CGI: it doesn't matter, there is something so masterfully soulful about King Kong himself that the movie scores one for the ages, if only in the fact that it makes me care about a creature who truly, madly, deeply---isn't there.If that isn't magic, what is?

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1OM5269E8J401	"Darryl M. Haase ""dothehucklebuck"""	"Jackson has given ""King Kong"" the epic treatment the classic story deserves.  The film is a labor of love dedicated to all those pre-teenage boys who grew up watching the original 1933 classic on the million dollar movie on Thanksgiving day and wanting to become filmmakers.  Those people who complain about the 3 hour running time just don't get ""Kong"" and they probably never will.  How else could Peter Jackson do it without making it big, bold and beautiful?  Sure, the exposition has a lot of stuff thrown in for good measure, like the whole ""Heart of Darkness"" commentary (which I would have liked to have seen developed further), but so what?  I thought it was great!Nothing will surpass the originality and imagery of the original film, as well as Fay Wray and her screams, but Jackson has made a ""Kong"" which pays homage to the original and is a great film in its own right."	5.0	Fay Wray would be proud!	2006-03-26	6	6	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ADVX0P3EIKWBK	Darth Wader	Finally, I saw King Kong after hearing so much about it and it was good.  It wasn't great, like Lord of the Rings obviously, but it definitely kept my attention throughout the 3 plus hours.  The special effects were magnificent, especially in the scenes where the dinosaurs were tripping all over each other and the scenes with the locals of Skull Island.  I thought Kong looked great and there was great emotion surrounding him.  Although one reviewer suggests that this movie was miscast, I strongly DISagree.  I thought Jack Black was perfect as a mixture of sleeze and charm, and played the part very well.  Naomi Watts, who has never looked prettier also did a great job with her connect with Kong.  Lastly, Adrien Brody, who is great in every movie I have seen with him, does the best job in this movie.However, this movie is not perfect, and it has some parts that hurt it.  First, the slow motion sequences in this movie were a bit too much.  It worked well in LOTR, and it would have worked in some scenes, but it was overdone and unneccesary in parts.  Also, the juggling scene with Naomi Watts looked extremely fake, but in the end WHO CARES, since the effects that really mattered were great.  I thought some parts seemed to drag as it took almost an hour to see Kong, but once we did, it is action all the way.  At the same time, it was like an older movie where it builds and builds to something great.  I thought Colin Hanks was annoying as usual and I wonder why he is in so many things with Jack Black.Although my wife felt more emotion towards Kong than I did (ie. I didn't cry!), I did feel like Jackson did as good of a job as he could creating that connect.  I won't be rushing to watch this movie again soon, but it is a movie that should be watched.  My biggest problem was the language...although it didn't have a lot in total, it has a lot of GD's and saying Jesus Christ (or some variation), which annoys me very much to hear.  If I would have known, I would have waited until it came on TV, so it is edited.	4.0	It was beauty killed the beast!	2006-08-07	2	0	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A27FR2C67JPDRS	Daryl B	"The arrival of ""King Kong"", one of the years most anticipated films, gives movie goers a big box office spectacle just in time for the holidays.  A lot of overwhelming expectations ride on this film and its director, especially since it is a remake of a beloved classic that most everyone has seen.  The question is this----Is Peter Jackson successful in remaking this movie?  I think the answer is yes.Although there are some problems with the film, I think overall Jackson did a nice job of bringing this story to the big screen.  Its obvious that this film was a labor of love.  Naomi Watts is perfect as the lovely Ann Darrow, the beauty who steals the heart of the beast.  Jack Black, the film director Carl Denim, adds humor to the story and Adrien Brody provides the human love interest for Ann Darrow.  But the true star of the movie is, of course, Kong.  And Jackson succeeded at humanizing the big ape, making the viewer realize that Kong has been taken out of his element.  Probably for me, the best moments in the film are the moments that Kong spends alone with Ann Darrow.  From the time that she dances for him and he sees her as a small, moving toy to the final scenes where she sees him in the street and the inevitable climb of the Empire State Building---these are the moments that make the movie.  The scenes are tender and, for me, are really the best moments in Jackson's remake.  I especially liked the scene where Kong with Darrow, discovers snow in the park---a nice touch.And for those who like action, there is plenty once their ship, the Venture, runs ashore Skull island.  From T-Rexes, huge long necks dinosaurs, giant insects and evil natives, the adventurors face a gamit of challenges, including Kong himself.  The special effects are good and keep the action flowing.Now for the problems.  To me the first hour is just too long.  I think the introduction of the characters and their storylines seemed to take forever.  My 8 year old nephew actually fell asleep for the first hour but awakened once Kong made his appearance. Also, as much as I enjoyed Skull island, I think the time spent there could have been edited a little.  The film score was okay but I think could have been a little more dramatic.Overall, however, I think this is a film you will enjoy.  Its a great popcorn flick and definitely should be see on the big screen.  Some of the scenes will be too intense for small children but my 8 year old niece and nephew enjoyed the film (the last two hours)---any younger and they may get bored or scared.  I look forward to seeing the extras that Jackson gives us with the dvd release next year!"	4.0	A  Date With a Gorilla!	2005-12-18	5	3	2

Only after my wife and kids picked up a copy did I change my mind...mainly just to be with the family.I was surprised. It's a great movie. I will watch it again.  First-the effects are exceptionally realistic.  I kept wondering...how did they make King Kong look so realistic?  And some of the actors were excellent.The plot was predictable, and we all know how the story goes...yet it was still fantastic to watch.  I have to say it's a five star movie that I expected to be a three star. Peter Jackson did a great job on this movie.I did notice one flaw in the movie...immediately after falling into a river two lead actors (Jack & Ann) change scenes and are running for their lives down the road...they had just climbed out of the river and voila! Their hair is dry and they really don't look wet at all even though they almost just died in the river.I think that one or two death scenes in the movie are particularly gruesome...so I would not let little ones watch this movie.  There is also a lot of profanity in the beginning of the movie...too much.The humanization of King Kong was done with such slight effects that it was believably unbelievable.  It's just a great movie overall and gets a great movie vote from me.It's the king of kong flicks that's for sure and most people would really like this movie from my perspective.  So get a copy and have a great time.	5.0	Way better than i thought it would be	2006-04-04	1	1	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2LKFJLWNMEKXN	David Abraham	One of the most memorable scenes in any movie by anyone ever appears in this re-make of King Kong by Peter Jackson.  They are still in the jungle and Kong is going home, with Anne, finally understanding the ape's intelligence and love, following him.  He climbs up onto his perch in time to view, what he must view every single day, the sunset.  This is no dumb brute, this is the father of our poets and our aesthetes.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY	"David A. Dein ""passafist"""	For every fifty or one hundred bad remakes one or two surpass the original. Especially if the film being remade is a cultural icon. If it ain't broke don't fix it many a critic of remakes would say. But like theatre that is imagined by different people all the time sometimes a fresh visionary can breath new life into an old story.Peter Jackson's KING KONG is a gutsy movie. When Jackson first announced his intention to take on the 1933 classic I like many thought back to the tragic and laughable 1976 remake that had a guy running around in a monkey suit and Jessica Lange hamming it up on the top of the Twin Towers. Let's face it in our modern times a movie about an ape running around New York City is so far fetched and silly there is absolutely no way to take it seriously. Jackson understood that and puts the action of KING KONG back in the 30's where the material and the world around the characters can be built by scratch. This works so well I could go on for pages about how good it is.But I digress....KING KONG follows the exploits of Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) a young actress whose just lost her last job. With no money in her pockets and the prospect of stripping for burlesque show, she agrees to star in struggling director Carl Denham (Jack Black) new film. Along with a dreamy leading man (Kyle Chandler), a writer (Adrian Brody), and motley crew of sailors and film people. Our hero's set sail to find a mysterious island in which will make the film a hit. To bad a certain Giant Ape, some Dinosaurs, a group of creepy natives, and various other wild animals will make that a little difficult for our intrepid band of misfits.KING KONG is three movies crammed into three hours and ten minutes. Movie 1 is a silly 30's romantic comedy, movie 2 is an intense horror film and movie 3 is a monster run amok in New York City. Apart they wouldn't work, but together Jackson has weaved a narrative that is better than the one conceived 70 years ago. That was merely the cliff notes. KING KONG is the richest popcorn movie I have ever seen.It's brimming with excitement. You cringe, you jump and most importantly you have a great time. This is the reason I go to the movies. From the first moment to the last KING KONG captures your attention and doesn't let go. One moment you laugh, the next you jump out of your seat, and then the next moment you laugh. Only a film with heart can do that.Instead of the subtext that has been heaped on the original by 70 years of critical praise. Jackson ups the ante by crafting a Kong that is almost human. He honestly loves Ann, and Ann is not just a screaming damsel. She truly cares for KONG. Although the giant ape is completely computer generated it's Andy Serkis's who provided the artists with Kong's movements and that really makes this Kong stick out. Like his work on LOTR as Gollum there is a lifelike quality to Kong that is so flawlessly beautiful.The other key factor to the film success is that Ann Darrow is not merely a damsel in distress. She has a heart and a soul. Watts fills Darrow with with such nuance and humanity. I'm not even sure the screenplay calls for the amount of passion she brings to it. A lesser actress could have done an adequate job. But Watts is just phenomenal and takes this b-movie premise into blockbuster territory.Kudos also go to Jack Black, Adrain Brody, and the rest of the cast who embody these characters with so much life. KONG would fail if it was just another special effects blockbuster. But because the actors and Jackson placed character above action, when these characters are in peril you actually feel for them. Thus their peril is kicked up a notch, and the audience has a lot of fun.Not since Indiana Jones has an adventure movie been so much fun to watch. A film that is so vibrant, so full of pure unadulterated joy and so much real imagination. KING KONG is easily the best film I've seen in the last five or six years. It's awesome.I think I figured out Jackson secret to making such successful films. His production team is a well oiled machine. Unlike most films that require a director to pick all new people on every project. Jackson, his wife Fran Walsh, and Phillipa Boyens have been working together since the mid 90's with editor Jamie Selkirk who has been with Jackson since the beginning. They know how to read each other and together they have crafted great film after great film.KING KONG is a marvellous screen outing. See on the big screen because it will lose something on even the biggest TV Screen. Run, swing on a vine, or order your tickets online. Just go see this movie.	5.0	THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR	2005-12-15	9	8	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AUEHG0DB54B7K	David A. Wend	"When I first heard that Peter Jackson had remake King Kong I first thought it was a mistake; would anyone be interested in seeing a remake of a remake?  But on seeing the film I think he has not only made a better King Kong but made one of the best films ever in its ability to tell a great story.My reason for thinking this is how completely Mr. Jackson tells the story: there are no wasted minutes and each character is fully developed.  We now have a complete background on the struggling vaudevillian Anne Darrow and we more than understand Carl Denham's struggle to make his film and his unscrupulous character (with the fatal flaw of hubris).  Most of all, Kong comes fully to life as a character with as complex a life as any of the other characters.  The film also beautifully re-creates the New York of the early 1930's down to the seedy and dirty look of the Depression, and could Skull Island be more formidable?Although this is a long film there is never a moment that I felt was pointless to building the story.  Peter Jackson also improves on the drama with the ship smashing into the rocks at Skull Island and the frightening natives that appear from nowhere.  The action sequences are well planned and are breathtaking to watch. The giant creatures on the island are truly frightening and the stampede of the brontosaurus-like animals is especially well done.  We also get a perspective on the hazards that Kong must face living on this island.  The relationship between Anne Darrow and Kong is build very well with her fear turning gradually into gratitude and, certainly, a love for this marvelous creature.  This is a different Kong, an older Kong, and all the credit is due to Andy Serkis's (who also made an interesting Lumpy) fine acting of the role: all of his preparation is up on the screen.The casting of this film was perfect.  Jack Black makes an outstanding Carl Denham; we understand the ruthless side of his character but in the end, perhaps, he comes to an understanding, with his final line, that he has destroyed something that was purely wild.  This latter belief, that wild creatures would be destroyed by their association with civilization, was something that Kong creator Merrian C. Cooper believed.  Naomi Watts is a wonderful Anne Darrow and Andre Brody makes a resourceful Jack Driscoll, and Thomas Kretschmann (better known from The Pianist) makes a perfect captain of the Venture.  But it is Kong who is given a new life in this film and becomes the intelligent creature that a true gorilla is and for whom we have sympathy.  He is not simply the ""brute"" of the 1933 version but has the depth of character that he deserves.  If one does not find the ending of the film heartbreaking then you have a heart of stone. For me, Peter Jackson has outdone the 1933 film and the 1979 remake with his version of the story of King Kong. There are many complaints in the reviews about the length of the film. For me it was the quickest three hours I have spent, and the other people I saw the film with were similarly mesmerized.  A truly remarkable film."	5.0	One of the Best Fims Made	2005-12-27	4	1	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"I'd like to start by saying that I'm not one of those cineastes who think that classic films should not be remade.  Plays are perpetually being revived on Broadway for new generations so why not film?  How can you debate a remake by Peter Jackson, arguably the finest craftsman working behind the camera today.  Jackson, cognizant of the revered status that the original ""King Kong"" holds, has fashioned a homage to the original film that not only lovingly pays tribute to it but may even surpass it in the process.  Recently I viewed the original ""Kong"" after not having seen it for a number of years.  It was most certainly durable and entertaining and I marveled at the groundbreaking effects work for it's day.  That said, there were also some dated elements to the film.  To my mind, Jackson's ""Kong"" contains breathtaking effects work as well as better narrative and character development than the original.  A common complaint about Jackson's ""Kong"" was it's length.  That however is a moot point because there isn't a wasted moment in the film.  My advice to any potential viewer is to watch both films and admire their inherent qualities.  Consider us fortunate that ""Kong"" inspired two truly great films."	5.0	Did Jackson Best the Original?	2006-04-02	3	1	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	"Peter Jackson is certainly on a roll.  I was tempted to remove half a star for the film's excessive length, but, as Roger Ebert wrote in his review, it's really complaining about too much of a good thing.  I was never bored and, when thinking about which sequence could have been cut, I realize that I don't want any of them to go away.  (In fact, I'm hoping that there will be even more on an extended edition for DVD in the future.)This film looks great.  New York is a stylistic marvel, a montage of popular Depression-era impressions with its vintage cars, clothes, and art deco architecture, not to mention the bread lines, elevated trains, and streets bustling with desperate people.  Skull Island is a steaming hell on earth with death lurking around every corner.  And Kong is a brilliantly realized CGI creation, even more emotive and realistic than Gollum of ""Lord of the Rings,"" who was also ""performed"" by Andy Serkis.The action is thrilling.  The character development is deft and efficient.  Jackson and his production team are at the top of their game.  The cast (most notably Naomi Watts, Adrien Brody, and Jack Black) is terrific.

Instead viewers are slapped in the face with what appears to be abismally small thumbnails that pop up WHILE WATCHING THE MOVIE!! From what I could understand from the already terrible user interface was you had to play the movie to see the artwork in the corner of the screen. If there was another way to view them the disc fails because I couldn't find the options and I'm usually pretty savvy at finding the right button if its there.The user interface is pretty disgusting.

But rest assured, once the monkey shows up, ""It's Showtime, Folks!"". The CGI in this film is staggering, especially where Kong is concerned. I was riveted on him from the first moment he shows himself, until the bitter end. For all intents and purposes, watching Kong in this movie is a virtual study in low land gorilla behavior and mannerisms. So real is this creature that you actually find yourself in his corner emotionally, throughout the film. There's a connection with Kong that none of the preceding ""King Kong"" movies could even come close to rivaling. And strangely, this is the first ""Kong"" movie that I didn't fall in love with the female lead, and perhaps for no other reason than the fact that she's pretty much been upstaged by her 25 ft. CGI co-star,.....he was THAT good!!There were some parts of the film that seemed inserted purely to be a promo for the King Kong video game that followed the theater release, but even that didn't dampen my anticipation for my next peek at the ape. You also won't find any radical twists in the same old story line followed by its predecessors, but again, Kong is such a visual treat, you won't mind.So sit back and enjoy!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	"This newest version of ""King Kong"" takes the old story, with a few twists, and polishes it with superb special effects that create the most human, the most believable, King Kong to date.  Aspiring and desperate actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) accepts a role offered by the shady producer Carl Denham (Jack Black) who promises her exotic travels aboard the ship he has procured.  Likewise, well-known playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) is tricked into the trip and thus writing the script featuring Ann and her self-involved co-star.  Unbeknownst to all but the captain and Denham, the ship sails not for Asia but for the legendary Skull Island, where Denham hopes to film a 1930s brand of reality television, complete with bona fide danger and discovery.  What they find there, however, exceeds all expectations.Naomi Watts is radiant and adept in the otherwise thin role of a woman at the mercy of forces beyond her control.  She and Brody have remarkable on-screen chemistry, but she shines most in her Kong scenes, where she charms the enormous beast with her spontaneous antics and, later, her compassion.  Yes, she can scream to rival Faye Wray and Jessica Lange, but director Peter Jackson allows her to act as well.  When she leaves the screen for a prolonged time near the end, the viewer misses her as much as Kong does.  Despite her performance, the real star of this film is digitally created Kong, a creation so realistic and nuanced that one can forget that he is not a real, breathing gigantic gorilla.  His transformation from terrifying brute to an animal who can both be amused by a cartwheel and sit contemplatively before a sunset is one of this film's greatest triumphs.The cinematic atmosphere, in muted colors and Art Deco landscapes, of 1930s New York lends the film a nostalgic texture that fits perfectly with this remake.  Jackson's favorite New Zealand countryside has the raw savagery that seems likely to harbor creatures such as Kong, gigantic bugs, and hoards of dinosaurs.  Despite the technical and artistic elements, ""King Kong"" falters because of the story itself, a tale that has always been subservient to special effects.  Its progress is so predictable and lacking of subtlety that, if not for the visual stimulation, the viewer would fall asleep.  In fact, the viewer can probably wander out of the room and return fifteen minutes later without missing anything important.For the sheer exhilaration of Kong's creation and the cinematography, this movie is worth watching -- once.

The bad news is that there are no other special features, so you still need the second &#34;special features&#34; disc of the 2 DVD set if you want to have the webcasts and other behind the scenes material.  If you already own the 2 disc DVD set, and you can get this blu-ray cheaply enough, it's worth the upgrade, as long as you keep the special features DVD.  If you don't care about special features and just want the best quality presentation of the film, then this blu-ray is also worth it.

(My credit-card company gave me a $20 discount on Amazonia which came in real handy here.)  Naturally, the extra background and production content made this thing a real steal, but I have yet to see any of that in favor of watching the near-3-hour-long flick itself 3 times so far.  That's the ONLY kind of DVD worth investing in anyway... one you could watch 25 times till you memorize every bit of dialog and scenery... and then watching it another 80 times!  Like The Wizard of Oz!This Remake has plenty of reverence for the original and has an exceptional level of coherent internal logic; it leaves less glaring continuity errors than any sci-fi/horror/adventure epic-picture I've seen in a long time.  It won't give you the same raised-hair-on-the-back-of-your-neck suspense and dread of the Original, but what will?  Dig those modern special effects!  ...even though, like all recent CGI (except the Jurassic Park fare), the beasties MOVE WAY TOO FAST.  Good thing you can slow things down with a DVD machine.Say, maybe that's why the first 'Kong was so much more frightening and impressive:  All that jerky, deliberate motion made a far more spooky impact than blur-fast animation...?

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2OFSDJB3MVQ16	Dennis W. Wong	"This remake of the 1933 classic film surpasses in many ways. First, the excellent direction by Peter Jackson and the script and also the stars Naomi Watts & Jack Black. Jackson has re-imagined the film with its references to ""Heart of Darkness"" while paying homage to the earlier film by bringing the setting back to the Depression. Also Watts has never been more sympathetic than in this film and Jack Black is a comic delight as the con man/director Denham. As for Adrian Brody, he was okay but did not stand out as much as Watts or Black. I have this in HD-DVD and it is definitely reference quality so until Universal makes the switch to Blu-ray in their selections, you can get this film at a premium price in HD (as low as $10).  The jungle scenes plus the finale in NYC are phenomenal in HD!! Recommended for all Kong enthusiasts and lovers of fantasy!! By the way, this disc has gone as low as $3 or $4 in HD DVD compared to the $20 or more that you'd have to pay to get it in Blu-ray---and there is barely any difference between the 2 Hi-Def formats--so consider!!  To update things a bit, this HD DVD can be had at the ridiculously low price of .73 cents!!  My only regret is that they could've had the extended version of this remake on HD DVD whereas the Blu-ray does have both--guess I'll rent the Blu-ray to check out the extended scenes."	5.0	Jackson goes Ape	2008-04-27	2	2	0

I went into this film expecting a good FX no story summer movie offered under the cloack of a holiday release.What you get is an fx chariter that is so full of life and soul that you abbandon all thought of FX and relax to the story. And although Jack Black is a bit Hammy in scenes it make no difference. Naomi Watts gives steller legs to the cut out character as thin as paper. But she fattens the part up and gives her a pulse.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AD7IBJCYSJ9EE	Destitute	"In 1933, King Kong rocked the cinema with its captivating story and great special effects(for the time.) In 1976, the film was remade and many didn't like it. Now, in 2005, director Peter Jackson, the man who brought you the epic Lord of the Rings films, breathes life back into our favorite ape!THE PLOT: If you've seen the original, you already know the story. If not, I'll tell you.A film crew consisting of Carl Denham, the director, Ann Darrow, the beautiful actress, Jack Driscoll, who is the storywriter, and many others. They are making a film on the mysterious Skull Island, an island that's not on the maps. What they find there is crazy natives, reptillian beasts, and a giant ape known as Kong!SFX: The CGI is amazing. The fur, scars, and expressions on Kong are really detailed.LENGTH: About 3 hours and 7 minutes. So if your one of those people who have a short attention span, you might want to see another film. Personally, I think the length adds to all the detail.ACTION: Lots of action. My favorite part is when Kong has to fight all those dinosaurs.EMOTION: Very emotional at the end. I shedded a tear at some scenes.ACTING: Good acting. Naomi Watts was perfect for the role.SHOULD I TAKE MY LITTLE KIDS TO SEE IT?: Well, there are a few parts that are pretty scary and violent, and most kids couldn't sit through a 3 hour film, so no. I reccomend for people ages 12 and up to see it.OVERALL: Even better than the original. One of my favorite movies of the year. Peter Jackson's done it again!EDIT: What's with all the ""no"" votes? I wrote a long and detailed review. Stupid haters."	5.0	Now THIS is how a remake should be made!	2005-12-23	6	3	3

With the dawn of the post-LOTR era the 2005 remake of ""King Kong"" proves that there is more to Pete than just ""Lord Of The Rings"". I was completely blown away by his take on the popular classic saga and gives the movie a whole new look.The story begins in New York City during the early 1930s in the depths of the Great Depression caused by the ""Black Thursday"" Stock Market Crash of 1929 with rampant unemployment and `Hoovervilles' springing up all over Central Park and elsewhere. Amidst the turmoil an ambitious filmmaker Carl Denham strives to make it rich by producing a motion picture broadway show. It just so happens that a young woman named Ann Darrow also aims to strike it big by entering the Broadway business but her dream is damaged when the place she was aiming to jump-start her career is shuttered. It just so happens that Denhan and Darrow's worlds collide when he convinces her to ride on a ship to a mysterious island near Indonesia called Skull Island to make a movie in order to finally make it big. What they find there is beyond anything they ever thought possible. First is a mysterious tribe with a vicious cult personality and they end up being captured and are believed to being sacrificed in a tribal ritual. Ann Darrow was a particular favorite of the tribe and they finally see what they were being `sacrificed' too."	5.0	An epic masterpiece remake! Fabulous job Peter!	2006-01-31	3	2	1

The creator of the epic, magnificentLord of the Rings Trilogy, easily the most ambitious endeavor in cinematic history, Jackson knows something about letting visuals tell a story.  And in this respect his remake of KING KONG doesn't disappoint; this is a feast for the eyes--an enticing visual thriller packed with enough special effects/CGI to keep you in your seat (for almost four hours, which is saying something).No need to rehash the plot; what I will say is watching Kong unleashed in Manhattan, circa 1933, is fabulous and wondrous viewing.  Jackson spares nothing, from the gaudy neon lights, to the hot dog wagons.  And the climactic scene, atop the Empire State Building?  I suffer from acute acrophobia, so for me this scene was both excruciating, and spellbinding, to watch (which means Jackson made it all look so very real).  Once this scene concluded I literally felt physically drained.So why the four stars?  Well, the film takes much too long to get going, and it doesn't really start to move until Skull Island.  I love Jack Black, but here he is hopelessly miscast as an ethically-challenged filmmaker/promoter.  And Adrien Brody looks more like Napolean Dynamite than a leading man, but that's just me.  I will say Naomi Watts looks right at home resting in Kong's paw, yet the ""love story"" in this respect definitely tweaked the ""ick"" factor.  But to heck with all that.  Peter Jackson's got the chops to make a great cinematic product, and KING KONG squarely fits the bill.--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning"	4.0	A Visual Smorgasboard	2009-05-07	1	1	0

It has it all.  It is visually stunning.  King Kong is argueably the most well done CGI character ever.  1930's New York city is recreated beautifully.  The acting in this movie is excellent, especially Naomi Watts' performance which is mainly reacting to blue screens and a human stand-in for Kong.  Andy Serkis also deserves recognition for his portrayal of Kong.  The love story between beauty and the beast is done extremely well, this aspect alone is far superior to any other version of this movie.  The story is faithful to the original while not coming off as a copy of it.  I was on the edge of my seat, I was captivated, and I was even touched by the awesome spectacle that is King Kong.  I would have done a few things differently, but I feel King Kong finally got the retelling that it has always deserved.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A14MDKXO9JGRGB	DocRemo	I wanted King Kong to be a great movie.  Unfortunately some elements of this film were so bizarre that any chance of this happening were lost. It's O.K. to accept a wild premise like a 25-foot tall gorilla; but common sense demands some attention to logic even in a wild fantasy. Here are my complaints:1. Ann Darrow was secured to the sacrificial altar and unable to extricate herself. When King Kong grabbed her, he would've ripped her arms off.  A wooden cage would have been more logical. Picking that cage apart would've been a neat task for the SFX crew.2. The crossing of the swamp was replaced by that ridiculous stampede sequence. Ever try running in front of a herd of elephants? After that scene I started to get uneasy.3. The chasm of insects was too deep for anyone to survive the fall... and there were too many INSECTS! More is not better. Lumpy deserved a more courageous demise.4. How did any of the crew know where to go to rescue anyone? There was no logical perspective of the island given and, considering how dense the jungle was, who knew that there was a signpost up ahead with Rod Serling directing traffic.5. I bet you didn't know that some transient Vampire bats moved into Kong's flat the night before. They must have else wouldn't Kong have relocated long ago? But school is not out yet! Lesson One-Introduction to hang gliding is coming up. Where's a pterodactyl when we need one?6. Catch a falling T-Rex in a vine. Win a trip to absurdity.7. It was absolutely positively IMPOSSIBLE to load King Kong on that ship! But let's say you could. Now all we have to do is keep him sedated with chloroform for (how long a voyage?), and sustain him with bananas intravenously fed.8. Poor Ann Darrow had to run around New York City in dead winter wearing what looked like a gown-less evening strap and she didn't even shiver not once.After all these crabby comments, I still liked the movie but I'm really sad to say that it wasn't what it could have been. You could still redo this, Peter, on the extended director's cut DVD.  Why not?	4.0	King Kong missed the mark and here's why...	2006-12-08	14	10	4

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A22J9WI2PDAVJ	Don D. Basina	"The task was to remake the original 1933 King Kong! This monumental undertaking was to update this film to today's standards and viewing habits. The one director pegged for this undertaking was the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy director Peter Jackson. This three time Academy Award (LOTR) winner was also a big fan of the original. So in a nutshell he had an unlimited budget. (Cost to make was $250 million)Naomi Watts (Ann Darrow) portrays her character with vitality and vigor. Adrien Brody (Jack Driscoll) and Jack Black (Carl Denham) play supporting roles to Watts and Kong. But Kong (Andy Serkis) steals the show (which he should) and falls for the vitality of Ann Darrow.The special effects make this film come alive with real life feel for that 1930's era. The sound and sound editing cannot be disputed for receiving Academy Awards. Kong's movement and expressions truly characterized Peter Jackson's attention to detail. And I was unexpectedly surprised by the Skull island inhabitants. They are not your ordinary, friendly type original movie islanders. All I can say is that they are very scary.I truly enjoyed this version of ""King Kong."" Peter Jackson has honed his film making skills. And is becoming a must see for any film that he touches. I recommend purchasing the two disc widescreen version. The second disc contains the ""Post Production Diaries"", ""Skull Island: A Natural History"" and ""Kong's New York, 1933.""

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1IPFS2WVJ1XP8	Dorian Tenore-Bartilucci	"I was one of the lucky winners of the Kong is King.net World Premiere Ticket contest, so my husband and I had the pleasure of seeing KING KONG in Times Square's Loews E-Walk Theatre. I knew I'd like it the minute I saw the Art Deco opening credits, very reminiscent of RKO's style. The movie only got better from there, carrying us moviegoers on a roller-coaster ride of adventure, romance, and eye-popping special effects. What raises Jackson's take on KING KONG above other rock'em-sock'em action blockbusters is that it's so clearly a labor of love in every sense of the term, a spectacle with soul and spunk. It's not every rollicking adventure film that begins with scenes of life in 1933 New York City, when the Great Depression was at its worst. No wonder plucky but vulnerable actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts is at her most beautiful and winsome as a more proactive version of Fay Wray's star-making role) is willing to take a chance with fast-talking movie producer/director Carl Denham (Jack Black, a rascally delight) on his latest project, involving leaving for the South Seas that very night.The characters are no mere genre archetypes; before their adventure begins, Jackson and his talented cast let us get to know and care about every one of them. When crewmen from the S.S. Venture get injured or killed by Skull Island's various fearsome natives and beasts, we mourn them. When Ann and playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody combines strength and sensitivity wonderfully as this unlikely hero. He gets my vote for Movie Mensch of the Year!) connect on screen, we're moved and rooting for them to get together, especially after they share one of this year's best screen kisses. Even the calculating Denham wins us over with his sheer force of will. A real Orson Welles type, the guy just loves making movies -- and money -- so much he'll go to insane lengths to make his project a reality, whether it involves outrunning his creditors, shanghaiing Driscoll on the Venture, tricking his cast and crew onto uncharted Skull Island, or dragging poor Kong across the sea from his island home to New York City.Most importantly, King Kong himself captivates us, thanks to a combination of WETA's amazing special effects and the range of emotion provided by a motion-captured Andy Serkis.  If only one cast member gets an Oscar nomination, I say give it to Serkis for his wonderful performances as both Kong and Lumpy the cook! :-) Kong has never been just another scary big ape in any of the previous film versions of his story, but Jackson and Serkis make him particularly engaging, not just because he looks so convincingly weatherbeaten, but he moves like an ape (on all fours, thank you) and has the facial expressions of a human. As a result, we can see how Kong's terrifying side is influenced by his tender side. Yes, I said ""tender."" How else can you describe his protectiveness towards Ann on Skull Island after she wins him over by performing her lively vaudeville act? When Kong does go nutzoid, it's because either he or Ann are being threatened, whether by people, planes, or Skull Island's jaw-dropping, scream-inducing array of monsters and aborigine tribespeople. Jackson & Company give the big guy plenty of dizzying set pieces to show his stuff, involving everything from dinosaurs, toothy insects as long as your arm, and speeding taxicabs in New York City traffic (the scene where Brody did his own stunt driving; all those years of drag-racing on the streets of Woodhaven, Queens really paid off! :-), to say nothing of the dazzling Empire State Building climax. Moreover, Andrew Lesnie's cinematography is as gorgeous as it is kinetic; Adrien Brody should make sure Lesnie photographs every film he's in from now on, because he's never looked so handsome as he does here! :-) KING KONG is over 3 hours long, yet I never once thought to look at my watch. It's 3+ hours and the price of admission well-spent."	5.0	Jackson's Soulful, Spunky, Spectacular Labor of Love	2005-12-14	2	1	1

She just happens to be a size 4--the size of the clothing available from wardrobe.  Somehow  the mismatched cast of the film and crew pull it together and they set sail on the high seas.  When the film maker (Jack Black)decides to take the crew to Skull Island some are hesitant.  On the island they find dinasaours and a giant gorilla kidnaps the Naomi Watts character.  The special effects in King Kong are awesome and the art direction is equally impressive.  At times it's as if the colors are going to jump off the screen at you. The film is three hours long.  The first hour of the film is neccessary for setting up the story but it drags.  It's a little late for ""what ifs"" but this film would have been much more engaging 45 minutes shorter.  The two disc special edition DVD includes a special introduction by Peter Jackson, his post production diaries, a featurette titled Skull Island: A Natural History and a featurette titled ""Kong's New York, 1933.""  if you are the kind of person really into knowing more about the movie you just watched pick up the two disc edition.  If it's only the movie that you want you should be satisfied with the single disc release."	4.0	Great movie, Slow Beginning, Good Special Effects	2006-04-14	1	1	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A37SFXAWN1CXO0	"Doug Danzeisen ""frankfan42"""	I have all three of the major Kong movies and find this one is actually pretty darn good.  Jack Black is always fun to watch and the story, although a little draggy in some places really does capture the essence of old New York in many ways.  Many panned this movie as overly long, and perhaps too violent. I thought it seemed to be a bit more realistic for that in view of the other Kong films. The extras included are really interesting, including the extra scenes. IMHO this is below the original Kong in ranking, but still an excellant film. The fact that my eleven year old son really enjoyed this and watched it non stop illustrates the drawing power of the movie. Yes, the digital effects are somewhat different than the live action 1976 version, or the stop action original version, but they are well done and really look pretty decent to my eyes. A worthy addition to the Kong catalog. God Bless ya!	4.0	Kong in the digital age	2013-12-09	0	0	0

The film itself is a take off on the original Kong film with Fay Wray.  The original was one of the greatest films ever made.  This one is nothing but an embarassment to Peter Jackson who has done better work.  Why anyone ever thought to make this piece of trash is beyond me.  This is one movie which I gave a lower rating to than Jeepers Creepers.  I never thought I would see a movie that would accomplish that feat.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1LPH8WY0JGUDK	"Douglas Finton ""dfinton"""	"When I first saw Peter Jackson's re-make of Kong in the theater, I liked it a lot as an hommage, and a modern re-telling, of one of the classic films of all time. In the theater, though, it seemed almost too much, both in length and its non-stop assult on the senses in the final two acts.So I'm glad to report how pleased I am with the Extended Edition release.  As in LOTR, the Extended Edition has a way of seeming *shorter* because, I suspect, the pace is more regulated and plot details are filled in that make the whole seem more seamless.  The picture quality is stunning, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is great so far as it goes.  (My only gripe: why no Dolby 7.1 EX option, or even better, a DTS ES option as in LOTR?)The extras are great and are far more informative and detailed than the Production Diaries, for those of us who are fascinated by the process of filmmaking.To give some context for these comments, they come from a Monster Kid of the '50's who grew up on the classic monsters on television and in Famous Monsters magazine.  I hope that Jackson's film in whatever cut, and extras such are provided here, inspire new generations of monster kids and filmmakers alike.  It probably seems old-fashioned to say so, but this quality of devotion to filmmaking, and this kind of glimpse into the world behind the film, offer modern-day viewers an experience that we ""back in the day"" could only have dreamed of."	5.0	Extended Edition a gem	2007-02-18	2	2	0

It is the poignant connection between the beauty and the beast. This is captured better than in any of the other renditions of the story.The only quibble I have with this film is the three hour running time. The story would have been more effective and more powerful if it was tighter and more compact. But Peter Jackson is determined to overwhelm us with technology and special effects wizardry. The technology is the biggest monster in the movie.I should also say that I was worried that I would be wasting three hours of my life being bored because I was watching something where I knew how it was going to end. But the interplay between the beauty and the beast had me hooked, and this made the film surprisingly less anticlimactic.Jack Black does a good job playing the smarmy, sneaky, capitalizing film director. And Naomi Watts is stunning as Anne Darrow. It is a much better version of King Kong than the 1976 remake, though not as compact and powerful as the original.	4.0	A Good Movie That Would Have Been Better if it was Shorter	2006-08-08	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A35YWA2V4QHOJ3	"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12"""	Director Peter Jackson did a remarkable job in re-making a big-budget KK movie with JURASSIC PARK type special effects.  In doing so, he actually dug out the original script from the 1930s and inserted many scenes that were cut out of the original film as they didn't have the technology to pull it off.It can be said that one can skip the entire first hour of the film without missing much insofar as KK is concerned.  However, the build-up of suspense does pay off when they finally reach the mysterious island.  Also, there are in the first hour a few nice allusions to Fay Wray as well as RCO productions, which made the original 1930s film.The island is the centerpiece of the movie.  They spend a lot more time on it than did the 1970s film, and they go ballistic with all the creepy creatures that they create.  The whole premise of the island is rather interesting:  what if there were a locale on the planet that was so isolated from the rest of the world that evolution went bananas in a variety of directions, while some other long-extinct creatures endured, becoming suspended in time?Naomi Watts proves herself to be worthy of following in the footsteps of Fay Wray and Jessica Lange (I won't mention the farcical KING KONG LIVES starring Linda Hamilton).  The Australian beauty is a great actress who also easily passes for an acrobat.Any fans of KING KONG must add this to their collection.  While everyone already knows the story (whether they've seen the 1930s original or not), it's still worth watching all over again - and again!	5.0	King Kong Lives!	2006-05-21	7	3	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3ORWAR4CAOPAC	DRob	"Peter Jackson's King Kong is a beautifully rendered version of the original movie. The special efects are fantastic, and the relationship between Kong and Naomi Watts is truly touching.Yes, it is much too slow at the start. Jackson spends way too much time building up the charaters of Naomi Watts and Jack Black. He could have cut that down to about 15 minutes without hurting the overall movie.But once you get to the island with Kong, the movie is a visual delight. It is a much better homage to the original than the pathetic attempt by Dino De Laurentis in the 70t's.When Kong comes back to New York and escapes from the theater, there is a beautiful scene of him and Naomi Watts ice skating. It's very lovely and adds a whole new dimension to their relationship.Even though you know what happens in the end, you still find yourself rooting for Kong. Once again, it has a sad ending, with the exact same words as were spoken at the end of the original- ""Twas beauty that killed the beast."""	4.0	A King of a Movie	2006-04-09	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A9CKMSQ6ZEWLB	D. Rodgers	King Kong is an amazing epic adventure that's not just one of the year's best remakes, but one of the year's best films. Director Peter Jackson has created one of the most intense and exciting adventure films I've ever seen. Everything about King Kong is first rate, from the cast, to the music, the production design and costumes to the amazing special effects. The film follows fairly closely to the 1933 original, but Jackson certainly adds his own personal touches here and there. He's able to dazzle us with the gorgeous visuals, but also keep us emotionally interested in the story and characters. Peter Jackson really is the kind of filmmaker that George Lucas wishes he was, that's right I said it. Why? Because you can clearly tell that Jackson's passionate love and respect for the material is what drives him to make a great film; he's just a boy with all the toys in the world, and is certainly having a ball with King Kong.King Kong starts off in New York City during the Great Depression. People are homeless, starving, and looking for hope. Among the suffering is Ann Darrow, played by the beautiful Naomi Watts, she's a stage actress who's play is suffering and before you know it she's out of a job, and her theater is shut down. That's when she meets Carl Denham, played by Jack Black, a dedicated and persistently ambitious filmmaker in search of a hit. He convinces Ann to accompany him and his crew to set sail to a mysterious place named Skull Island that may or may not even exist, so he can shoot his next picture. On board the ship, which is appropriately named Venture, she meets Jack Driscoll, played by Adrian Brody, a play writer who Ann's greatly admired, and Jack is instantly attracted to Ms. Darrow.They discover the mysterious island bathed in fog one night, nearly crashing ashore. They set foot on the island and are attacked by a hoard of creepy natives, and Ann is captured and served as a sacrifice to Kong. From this point onward the entire film is one massive and intense spectacle after another. I don't want to spoil any thing but let's just say that it involves a large variety of dinosaurs, nasty bugs, huge bats, and pretty much anything slimy that your imagination can conjure up. The rest of the story is pretty much the classic tale that everybody knows; the beautiful actress befriends the beast, then is captured and brought to the Big Apple, where mayhem ensues.King Kong impressed me on such a high level for virtually the entire film; I was swept away and enthralled in the adventure. I didn't mind at all that the film was over three hours long, if it had been longer I really wouldn't have minded (no butt ache here, I was having so much fun). King Kong in my book deserved to get a few more Oscar nominations than what it got, because the direction was amazing, the writing was great, the music was thrilling, but also Naomi Watts' performance was really something as well. Simply put... I LOVED this film. King Kong is another dazzling epic from Academy Awarding winning Director Peter Jackson, and here he reminds us once again that he certainly deserves that title. Thumbs way up! Now just hurry up with the Extended Cut! I'm dying to see that scene with the monster in the swamp.	5.0	I laughed, I cried, I had one helluva good time!	2006-04-01	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A304NJUUPO8L40	"Dr. Richard Daystrom ""creator, M-5 multitroni..."	I grew up loving the early ape films King Kong (1933) and Mighty Joe Young (1949). King Kong is a classic retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story and the original was groundbreaking in its use of special effects. Remaking a classic will always attract harsh critics.For me, a lover both of classic films and of modern science fiction, I place King Kong (2005) among the best films I have seen in years. In the cinema, this was a true spectacle to behold. The action and CGI special effects were astounding. Peter Jackson took a fairly sparse story and fleshed it out. I appreciated the longer back-story to the characters in New York prior to the sea voyage to Skull Island.The exposure of themes relating to racism, animal and ecological abuse, and treatment of women was obvious, but not preachy. Despite this being an action film, these themes seemed to me as large as Kong was himself.Jackson tweaked the storyline a bit and improved on the original. The introduction of the writer (Brody) as love interest instead of the ship captain made more sense and was simply a better story. With the original film, I was quite moved as a kid when Kong died. With this version, I was at least as moved or more as an adult. The relationship with Kong and Ann was portrayed better. I believed that they had made a bond with each other. The moment of Kong's demise is one of the most touching moments I have seen in a film in years.Finally, James Newton Howard's soundtrack is quite moving, with beautiful, stirring melodies befitting this grand film. Worth listening to in its own right. I would have liked to watch the film with an isolated music score. Unfortunately, this was not included as an option on any edition so far.Editions:Two-Disc Special Edition (2006)For the collector, this included the Production Diaries and several bonus features. A must-have if you love this film and want more background information.3-Disc Deluxe Extended Edition (2006)There is no overlap to what is on the 2-disc version, so this was a worthwhile second purchase for me. I enjoyed seeing the deleted scenes. The slightly longer (13 min.) version was intereresting to see. I especially wanted the audio commentary track. No regrets here for having bought both the 2-disc and 3-disc versions, because they each offered different material.	5.0	A timeless classic	2007-07-01	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A106YXO3EHVD3J	"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b"""	Being a huge fan of the original, I have always been leery about a remake of this classic adventure film. The 70's version was horrible in my opinion with a sequel King Kong Lives that is probably one of the worst films ever made!After reading Jack Black was starring in the remake, I was again very skeptical about the outcome of this film. I went to the theater with an open mind and hoped for the best.The film being set in the 30's like the original was key for me and I found Naomi Watts to be a fine Ann Darrow. Jack Black also impressed me because while his usual persona is a zany comedic actor, he plays Karl Denim with just the right amount of cheesy Ed Wood glee.The trailers I watched of this film made me think the FX would not impress and looked cartoony, but seeing the film in a theater I was totally amazed (most of the time) especially with the FX used for Kong.The film is long at close to 3 hours, but I was never bored, it takes a third of the film before we reach Skull Island, but it gives us a chance to soak up the characters and the beautiful detail Jackson put into this film. I own the extended version as well and even though it runs longer it actually feels shorter and is worthy of a purchase as it adds more dinosaurs. It also has a huge amount of brand new extras to help temp you even further.OK, now we've reached the island and instead of having comical natives with coconut bras and bones through their noses, we are treated to some seriously disturbing ones who are quite scary and violent with the island intruders. I'm pretty sure everyone on this planet knows the story so I doubt there will be any spoilers in this review.Now we reach the make or break moment when we see Kong for the first time. He is a sight to behold and I actually like the extended version at this point because the chase is much more hectic with more monster mayhem.There is some controversy with what happens between Ann and Kong. In the original, Kong is a monster and even though he is fascinated with Ann, she is terrified of him from when she first lays eyes on him to the finale. In this film and the 70's version (which I loathe!) there is a connection with Ann and Kong, in the 70's version it is quite silly and comes across campy, but in Jackson's version it seems very believable because Kong is an intelligent creature,  an ape, not a monster. The scene where they bond is very touching and I find it believable to a point, the point being if you can suspend disbelief for an ape that is 30 feet tall, then you can believe the bonding of two intelligent creatures.Kong acting more like an ape helps give the story more depth and I found this version to really be the most interesting of all of them. Like I stated in my first sentence, I am a huge fan of the original seeing it 100 times in my lifetime, but this is the reason for a remake, to bring something new to a story without losing sight of the original concept.Some other fine examples of worthy remakes being The Thing (1982) and The Fly (1986).  Both films only add to the original, not taking anything away from them.The dinosaur fights, especially the triple threat T Rex battle with Kong are long but impressive, the most unconvincing is the Brontosaurus stampede, over the top, but still very good for the most part.One big controversy is the addition of the infamous spider pit scene that was cut from the original film. It really isn't necessary and it is quite ugly and long, but who am I to argue with more monsters? It is a nice contrast to the sappy story between Ann and Kong so I liked it overall.OK, now we get to the Big Apple and the inevitable, the sad demise of this beautiful creature and while in the original we feel empathy for the little animated puppet Kong brought to life by Willis O'Brien, in Jackson's version it brings you to tears. There is one shot in particular that I found extremely heartfelt as Kong takes his stance atop the Empire State building not knowing exactly what he is up a against, he prepares to battle and protect Anne no matter what his fate. It is truly a wonderful moment, the kind of moment that is why we all go to see movies in the first place. If I had one negative thing to say about this film, it's that I didn't believe Jack Black when he spoke the famous last words......maybe no one could get that right?The Blu Ray includes both theatrical and extended cuts of the film, but I'm not sure it includes all the extras from both editions. I've seen both DVD's editions selling for $5.00 each and are well worth it for the extras alone, but Kong looks incredible on Blu Ray, so that is the way to go as far as the movie is concerned.So overblown or not, Jackson's King Kong is one of the greatest remakes of all time and something he should be proud of!, making possibly the best giant creature film ever made.	5.0	WHY REMAKES ARE MADE IN FIRST PLACE!	2013-05-02	2	2	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3T9R54UZPUGZG	Dr. Thomas Hart	"There is a lot to be said about King and about Kong. I like Stephen King a lot, but unfortunately, the film is not based on one of his stories. About Kong: one of my first movie experiences was watching Kong in the backroom of a Northern Bavarian restaurant, in a special Sunday afternoon 16mm kids' screening. Only the second half, though, so all the rubbish about explaining why anybody would go to this island in the first place was left out. (this was the 1980s version, by the way). The monkey was allright, however, I have to defend it against all these nasty reviewers who refuse to loose a good word about this version.Matter-of-fact, in 1985, there was a reason to remake King Kong. In 2005, admittedly, there was not. Fortunately, most of the tales about production costs is an outright lie, of course, because every child can see that 76 per cent of the film is just a director's cut of Lord of the Rings and Jurassic Parc and Evolution and some of the realted BBC material. The rest is not very good, but a nice distraction on a Sunday afternoon. And most of it is very loud, too, so you can try the settings of your hearing aid, if you had one. If not, you will need one.Now the objectively reviewing part: the airfight at the end really made me dizzy, so I guess it was well directed. Unfortunately, the monkey dies at the end (I really crossed my fingers for him, but I had tried that before when watching ""Titanic"" and to no avail, so I was not too surprised). I hope that there is KingKong II - The Curse of the Were-Monkey, or that maybe they let Terry Gilliam direct it.

In this CG master-piece we get to see Dinosaurs in far better quality than Lord of the Rings and ruins in far greater beauty than Indiana Jones.  Even the old world of New York city was captured with a supreme beauty.That said everything is down hill from there.  The action is so wild and so over played and so ridiculous people were laughing in the theater just because it was so over done.Story Line, I think Peter Jackson's work with Lord of the Rings should speak for itself.

The Kong and Ann relationship at the core of the movie is handled excellently.  We see why Kong may become protective of his diminutive charge and not eat her as she uses Vaudville slapstick comedy to entertain him.  The joy on his face is evident.  And then when this tiny person actually stands up to the giant we can see why he might even respect her more.  As he protects her from the dangers of Skull Island we see why Ann would come to feel fondness for the giant simian.  Never is there a creepy vibe from their mutual fondness.  Every scene involving Kong made me believe he was there and his abilty to emote sold the character.  Also, even though on the long side, the introductory hour of characterization was nice to get to know our characters.The not so good...  As soon as our heros reach the island the action begins and never stops.  Not so bad, but some of it is very hard to swallow.  In the LOTR trilogy we see CG creatures we believe in and even more important the actors seem to as well. In Kong we see our characters running with a stampede of Brontosaurs and it seems like they are just jogging down the road by my house.  I've seen more fear in my own eyes having to look at said joggers in their tight jogging pants than I saw in the faces of our characters.  Never once could I suspend my disbelief and believe they were really in any danger or even inhabiting the same space.The same thing happens again and again, the bug scene, the crocodile like lizard scene, the T-rex chasing Ann scene, the bats.  Oh,my.  And our characters are superhumanly able to go on and on with nary a scratch, other than the dead ones. Only Kong was able to pull the movie out for me.  Kudos to Andy Serkis (of Gollum fame)and the animators for making me love the ape and thank goodness the last third of the film is his alone.Watch it, at least once, if only for the Ape.  You may want to drink a little to help with the rest.	3.0	Kong, Kong, Kong of the Jungle	2006-04-04	8	8	0

As the movie unfolds the relationship between the delectable Ms. Watts and the hulking King draws you in and, at the end, you're sympathetic for the big guy.That said, some of the other acting and especially the character of the director are cartoonish and unpersuasive.  And it's a wonder Ms. Watts' clothes stay on as much as they do given all the Perils of Pauline she goes through.  Much less why her arms aren't torn out their sockets as Kong tosses her around.  1930's-era New York City is especially well and entertainingly depicted, in light and detail as opposed to the dark Gothams of the ""Batman"" franchise.Hey, this movie succeeds as well-done, over the top entertainment, and that is what it's supposed to do, isn't it?"	4.0	Long but a fun flick	2006-05-17	3	1	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"There is plenty to nitpick about in this three-hour adventure epic, but I would be hard pressed to challenge the expansive power of filmmaking wunderkind Peter Jackson's imagination and how he is able to translate his vision so vividly on film. Even more than the unstoppable special effects and state-of-the-art computer graphics, what I appreciate most about this 2005 version is the respect Jackson obviously has for the original 1933 film classic and his innate understanding of what still works from that story. The smartest decision he made was to leave the story's setting in 1933 rather than try to update it (as was done in the greed-oriented, oil-crisis-focused 1976 remake - which is ironically the most dated of the three versions). In fact, Jackson, along with his ""Lord of the Rings"" co-screenwriters Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh, have remained amazingly faithful to the original story and concurrently expanded it just enough to bring a greater depth of character development, even to Kong himself.The familiar plot begins with unscrupulous filmmaker Carl Denham who steals his film from studio executives who are tired of his endless safari footage. Denham desperately needs a leading lady who will fit the costumes for his new film and finds down-on-her-luck vaudeville performer Ann Darrow. He also has playwright Jack Driscoll help with the script, but then Jack gets tricked into accompanying Darrow and the film crew on a tramp steamer headed for Skull Island where Denham wants to shoot his film. Once they reach the island, they are met by savage natives, and Ann is eventually captured to be offered up as sacrifice to Kong. Smitten with Ann, Jack sets out to rescue her, while Denham's target is capturing Kong. Dinosaurs and other unsavory predators intercede on the island, and Ann becomes beholden to Kong for saving her from ensuing peril. However, ultimately Denham is successful in bringing Kong back to New York. Finally enraged by his enslavement, Kong breaks free and escapes but meets an inevitably tragic fate.Although he doesn't make his entrance until well into the second hour, Kong is not as imposing as I would have expected. What impresses me is the acrobatic dexterity of the creature and its lifelike characteristics, courtesy of images animated from the likeness and movements of Andy Serkis, who not only was Gollum in ""Lord of the Rings"" but also is the steamer's cook in this movie. Avoiding the ironic humor arising from humanizing Kong (a big misstep with the 1976 version), Jackson keeps Kong's behavior consistent with a gorilla's albeit one who has become the last of a gigantic, aggressive subspecies. The film's most resonant aspect is the unconventional love story between Ann and Kong - not a ludicrous manifestation of primal urges but an almost old-fashioned courtship that is equal parts Dion Fossey and old Hollywood movies. Jackson and his crew somehow make it all credible.Give major credit to Naomi Watts, who brings an alarmingly natural quality to a most unnatural situation as Ann. Not only does she have the becalmed beauty and vulnerability that makes Kong's attraction completely understandable, but she has the wherewithal and piercing intelligence (even juggling rocks and doing clumsy somersaults) to make the story move with some semblance of reason and emotional motivation. Jack Black is an inspired choice to play Denham, as his trademark manic energy and psycho-stare seem well suited for the part. At times, he seems on the verge of parody, but he plays the more unsavory moments with convincing abandon. As Jack, despite a too-contemporary look about him, Adrien Brody shows himself to be leading man material, even though he is overshadowed by both his human and computer-generated co-stars. Granted it's not his fault that Jack's romance with Ann is secondary to the plot.The expected set pieces on Skull Island are effectively terrifying from the foreboding rocks to the spooked natives (who oddly disappear later on) to the series of dinosaurs, bats, spiders and other odd creatures that chase and often mangle their human prey. My one nagging feeling is that too much time is spent on the island with the sequential chase scenes becoming too numerous, especially as Jackson obviously likes doing variations on the same theme. However, one particularly effective scene has Ann, Kong and three dinosaurs getting caught in a tangle of vines down a ravine during a major battle royale. For all of the deadly fauna of the island, I am even more impressed with the recreation of 1933 Manhattan, in particular Times Square, the authentic-feeling detail of which is mind-boggling. The last scenes with Kong reunited with Ann work magically, even the potentially ridiculous scene of them on a frozen Central Park pond and most poignantly in the last aerial-bound moments. While it's true that the computer animation gets too obvious at times, especially in the avalanche of activity on Skull Island, we still reap the benefits of Jackson's successful realization of his vivid imagination around the King Kong fable. He is like a modern-day Cecil B. DeMille with Spielberg's more whimsical savvy, and his movie is masterful popcorn entertainment."	5.0	Epic Popcorn Entertainment Borders on Excess But Succeeds and Resonates Unexpectedly	2006-01-09	9	7	2

I also have no problem with it being heavily laden with CGI effects (you do what you have to in order to make the movie you want the public to watch and buy).  I accept the story departures because I liked a lot of the revisions that Jackson made (however much we want things to be written in stone and tamper proof, people will muck about with the things we love).The problems I do have with this film have more to do with the overall creepiness of the relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts).  The idiotic casting choice of Jack Black as Carl Denham (he immediately turns Denham into a nasty slug, entirely too vile and despicable to enjoy on any level).  And the Ichabod Crane look-alike Adrien Brody as Ann Darrow's second choice love interest.  Getting past them took some doing, managed only because the story kept things aloft and alive.I will always hate the final line of both films because it's so obvious that ""beauty"" had nothing to do with killing the beast.  The blame falls squarely on the little weasel quick to cast the guilt elsewhere.I did love the sumptuous look and feel for the time period depicted, the fabulous adventure on Skull Island (I could have enjoyed more of this and less of the love interest between Kong and Darrow), and the lovely score by James Newton Howard.I choose to regard this as less a remake of the classic original and more of an addition to the continuing saga of Kong."	4.0	"""I've come into possession of a map."""	2013-03-16	0	0	0

Various old scares and many other details, made them look believeable and they also maintained there size throughout the whole movie. Kong doesn't magically get bigger at any time. The scene in the park was pretty sweet and gave ya a warm feeling. The fact that a beautiful women falls for a average looking guy was nice to see for a change.The Bad: Over the top super fake scenes which sadly is in most of the movie. Some poorly rendered CG animals and bugs. Three T-Rex chasing one blonde girl ever after chasing a larger meal, yeah okay. The stampeding scene with the dinos, okie dokie.The fact that people where so easily manipulated by Jack Black. The fact that Jack's character as annoying and adnoxious as he was and the jerk never dies.Conclusion: It was an okay movie. Not as great as people made it seem like it was.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	"Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 King Kong is exactly how to do a remake. This movie keeps to the spirit of the original, whilst including state of the art special effects and exciting action scenes. Jackson didn't try to add any silly plot twists or change the setting to 2005, but rather set out to remake the original film as it stood. He deserves a lot of credit for resisting the urge to ""improve"" the basic plot structure and settings of the original King Kong.The only significant change Jackson made to the plot arch of the original is that Ann Darrow is no longer a vapid blonde yelling her head off, but rather an empathetic, subtle person who is genuinely moved by Kong's pain. This makes the movie much more emotionally sophisticated and interesting than its predecessor - and one of the few times when a remake truly does improve upon the original.And what a remake. I thought the casting, effects, and soundtrack were great in setting the mood (Naomi Watts was perfect as the new Ann Darrow). The native Skull Islanders were absolutely creepy - a far cry from the silly natives in the 1933 version. Best of all, Kong himself looks superb, both realistic and empathetic. I nearly cried when he died.Sure, the plot is contrived and it's filled with ""Hollywood moments"" of unrealistically impeccable timing. But at the end of the day, like its predecessor, this movie is about finding wonder in the world (or the movies). King Kong shows the epic struggle between the exotic, capitalism, and modern society - on unfortunately in which the exotic Kong meets his demise.My only criticism of the movie is that sometimes the action can become too drawn out - one epic battle after another, after another... All of them are very well done and will get your adrenaline pumping. It might be too much for some people though. I love watching this movie once every few years, but could never watch it much more than that.The best thing I can say about this movie is that it makes the original obsolete - Jackson's remake captures everything great about the original, while updating the special effects and filling it with an even better cast.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AXFI7TAWD6H6X	Erica Anderson	"When I first heard that Peter Jackson was making a modern version of the 1933 classic ""King Kong"", all I could think of is the atrocity of the late '90s version of ""Godzilla"". I thought it would be a disaster. Thankfully I was wrong. Peter Jackson took some great care in the making of the film. Casting Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow was a smart move. Naomi has that classic Hollywood look that you just don't see in most film stars nowadays. Hiring Adrian Brody to play Jack Driscoll was a highly unusual choice but it worked. The only miscast was Jack Black as the ambitious, misguided Carl Denham. Jack Black was totally wrong for this role. He just got on my nerves as did his eyebrows.As the story goes, Carl Denham is trying to get his latest film project off the ground. He wants to film his movie on a mysterious island After losing his first actress of choice, Carl accidently comes across Ann Darrow, a struggling vaudville actress. Once he has his cast and ship crew put together, they set sail for what everyone thinks is Singapore. What they find is Skull Island. It doesn't take long for the film crew to stumble upon the inhabitants of Skull Island and some of its wild life, namely zombie-looking people and a gorilla named King Kong.Unlike the 1976 turkey starring Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges, this latest King Kong version follows the path of the 1933 classic but more detailed. The film starts off very slowly but I have to admit it does an effective job in telling the story of the characters and how they met. The other flaw is the obnoxious film score which I found to be annoying and overwhelming. Is it really necessary for music to be in every single scene in a movie?The real star of the film is King Kong himself. He may be computer generated but he is very realistic in terms of facial expressions, and body movements. His battle scenes with the dinosaurs, bats, and airplanes were nothing short of spectacular. King Kong's interactions with Ann Darrow were my favorite scenes, especially in the last half hour of the film.""King Kong"" definitely could have been shorter. Two and a half hours at the most, three was a bit indulgent and too much for this filmgoer. Pound for pound, this film is a monster hit with me regardless of the length, the casting of Jack Black, and obnoxious film score."	4.0	King Kong lives	2005-12-17	0	0	0

Anyone out there a fan of Beauty and the Beast stories? Well, they don't get much better than this.This cut of the film is 201 minutes long, worthy of the mighty Kong himself. At over six hours, there's a mighty serving of behind the scenes and audio commentary, nearly forty minutes of deleted scenes, outtakes (my favourite), and a great deal more. The picture is amazing on DVD even when played on a PS3 and 47"" Vizio.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A146D2LYLICNLS	eric_f	"First off, I have to list the things I did not like about this remake:1) Too long. Peter Jackson seemed to have his brain on ""Lord of the Rings"" mode when making this. Either the editor was bribed or somehow forced to neglect his job, because many scenes should have been cut (they would make for some interesting deleted scenes though). Case in point: the romance between Adrien Brody and Naomi Watts. Was there a purpose to it? No. I don't mind a long movie, but I do mind pointless screen time.2) Jack Black. Sorry Jack, you were miscast. Peter Jackson said in a recent interview that he casted Black mainly because his children are a fan of Black's. That's all cute and fuzzy, but what about the rest of us who have to witness him in the role? I like Jack Black actually, but he was way over his head here.3) Peter Jackson resorts to a lot of cliche. Group of cast members are able to escape being flattened to pancakes when having a marathon race with a bunch of dinosaurs. Young inexperienced rebellious castaway sneaks into the group after being told by tough-as-nails superior to stay away. Minor character is killed right away by island inhabitant yet major protagonist is saved at the last second from the same fate. Etc.4) A plot hole big enough for Kong himself to jump through: how did they get Kong back to New York? As bad as the 1976 version was, at least they explained how Kong was transported back. So I guess in this version Kong was forced to swim to New York City at gunpoint. Or does Peter Jackson expect us to believe that they used that hunk o' junk ship to take him back?5) Some scenes are insulting to the viewer's intelligence. Case in point, when tons of bugs are shot off Adrien Brody by a punk who's probably holding a machine gun for the first time in his life. Brody should have looked like a spaghetti strainer, but no, not one single shot! A suspension of disbelief is required for this type of movie, but this is laying it on just a little too thick.What I liked about the movie: Everything else. Enough to give it 4/5 and purchase the DVD. And I didn't even mind the Central Park ice skating scene.Naomi Watts carries the film and proves (yet again) that she's one of the top actresses we have.

Perhaps those who have a hard time sitting still for 3 hours will enjoy the film when they can take periodic breaks.  I had no problem sitting for three hours.  The film is basically in four parts: New York, The Boat Trip, Skull Island, Back to New York.  I was captivated by the first part as I watched an amazing depiction of New York City circa 1930 in full color. I also enjoyed getting to know the characters and am at odds with those who disliked Jack Black.  He had that almost crazed look in his eyes and struck the right tone as a director who would risk so much to achieve fame. Naomi Watts was absolutely radient and was a joy to watch.  The Skull Island sequences provided dazzling, edge-of-your-seat entertainment with a truly believable CGI ape battling harrowing creatures.  And lastly, the Empire State scene was breathtaking and Peter Jackson did a great job creating empathy for the great Kong.  All told, this was an excellent modern reimagining of a great story.	5.0	I'll be interested to see the DVD sales numbers	2006-03-07	10	9	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	Every Kong film has their ups and downs, but some of them can be a bit obvious. This new 2005 remake is probably slightly better than the original. Kong is given a more ferocious and more human appearance, while the CGI effects are top-notch. Naomi Watts, Jack Black, and Adrien Brody are absolutely amazing here (but they still can't top Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot). And the action is what you would expect from a Kong film, only that it's probably the most exciting we'll ever see when it comes to this version. But there are, as always, flaws. The sub-plot that involves Jimmy and Hayes was not needed at all: it slows the film down and it sometimes feels like it turns into a completely different movie. The references to the original 1933 film are clever, but there are too much of them in this film. They become irritating once we get into the third act. The music theme wasn't eerie and powerful enough; it could have been improved. And finally, having it all set in 1933 again makes it all a bit tedious. It could have been set in the late 30's or early 40's to make it look a bit unique.But still, this is an ultimate Kong remake. It's got great effects, wonderful jungle settings, and a new and improved look for the ape himself. All three films (1933, 1976, and 2005) do have their own ups and downs, but I still like all three of them.	4.0	"""And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty . . . and beauty stayed his hand."""	2009-10-08	2	2	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ANC27M99BGQE4	"Erik Wegner ""Erik Otto Wegner"""	I felt that King Kong did not live up to Peter Jackson's previous works, Creatures, Frighteners, LOTR, and was at times filled with too long of V Rex fight scenes as well as death and looking scenes. The pacing was slow after the first hour and it became less interesting until the end of the film. Although the energy of the first hour was building it up, it failed to deliver what was promised from the strength of the opening of the film. It would be a good film to sit at home with on a rainy day when you have a lot of free time that you don't know what to do with, but it is very different than what he has done before.	2.0	Not Jackson's best work	2006-03-28	5	2	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1ZUBL657P8FMY	Ernesto Jose Lopez	"Since I can only recall the 1976 version, which I liked very much as a kid (I was only 5 years old or something when I first saw the film), it had such an impact in my mind as a kid, that I had several king kong or gorilla toys.I have not seen the original movie so far, therefore I only have the 1976 version as a reference. Looking back at it now as an adult, I agree that it is not really a good action/adventure movie and that the impression of having a giant ape was not achieved because of the proportions of the ape(it is clearly a human in an ape costume, but it didn't matter to me when I was a kid), as well as other ""special effects"" really look fake to me. Then, I saw the ""King Kong lives"" version of the 80's and kinda liked it (I was a teenager by then), but it fell even shorter than the 1976 version and lacked logic and coherence. But algother, I think at the end, I thought it was like an ""iconic"" movie franchise that really did not needed to be looked at in a serious way again and was kinda ""shelved up"" inside my memory along with all the good movies I liked as a kid, but surely would be laughable to me if I saw them again. This really seemed an even more ""dead"" franchise than the Batman franchise (another of my favorite icons as a kid, which I am really pleased to say was ""revived"" again in all its glory with the new ""Batman begins"" Chris Nolan movie....awesome movie!!! whereas the Schuhmacher versions can be really put to oblivion and the Burton versions were OK, but seemed too ""cartoonish"" to me), but it took Peter Jackson to make magic in every possible way to make this movie a masterpiece.Although most of my friends rave about and praise the LOTR trilogy, I only really like the last 2 of the series(in the first movie you could easily save like 45 minutes of the movie if you took away Frodo's annoying panic gestures shots that lasted for at least 5 minutes each, I don't know, I just felt it as being too long) and then, of the last 2, the Return of the King is really a ""classic"" to me. Of course, some folks cannot see the trilogy as individual parts and rave about the whole trilogy, but this is my opinion.Well, I am happy of having given it a shot, since when I first learned that Peter Jackson was making a remake of King Kong, I thought... why bother?? But since it was Peter Jackson's version I thought I might give it a shot and I'm glad I did. I have seen this movie 3 times in theaters, and, if given the opportunity, I would see it once more. Sure, I agree with some of the reviewers about the dinosaur stampede, which could easily have been cut down to some minutes as well as the insect/weird worm scene... it's totally unnecessary for me to extend those scenes the way P Jackson did, but I think it was necessary to have the hour long wait for the big hairy guy to appear, since we get to see the human side and motivations of the main characters.It was awesome to see Kong in the different action scenes whereas the 1976 really fell short with that totally uncomprehensible plastic fake snake fight scene. Apart from that scene, we only see him in action in New York, and that is, for a short time. When I saw the dinosaurs in the movie trailers, I thought... why even bother putting dinosaurs on a movie again? Another Jurassic Part deja vu? Dinosaurs meets Kong kinda ""monster vs. monster"" type of thing? It was just until recently that I learned that they were included in the 1933 version, and most likely, were one of the first attempts in movie history, to include dinosaurs on movies. But the snake scene, barely had a purpose for me on the 76 version as no other strange Skull Island creature was brought to life on this version, thus, cutting down the ""action"" factor.It was also awesome to see the development of the relationship between Kong and Ann, where I think Jackson really did an awesome job. I don't even think that it was a ""man-woman"" love the one that was developed on screen, it was more like a big admiration and friendship they felt for eachother.But well... I cannot wait to have it on DVD, but I hope I don't have to wait for several versions of the DVD to come out to get the ""special edition"" or whatever Universal wants to call it, including the ""making of"" documentary right from the first DVD version they make available."	5.0	new iconic monster movie!!!	2006-01-23	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1PQLR0EN31PE8	E. Smith	I went into this movie with a lot of doubt.  There has been numerous Kong remakes, sequels and such.  I was going into the theater thinking that I really don't want to be here. I thought I was going to see the exact same movies as all the other King Kong remakes.  BOY WAS I WRONG!  First let me warn you that is is a long long movie, just a bit over 3 hours.  And admittedly, the first part of the movie was a tad slow.  It was all character set up.  We get to understand the two man characters played by Jack Black and Naomi Watts.  The boat trip is the bridge to when the characters arrive on the island and from their, the movie not only really takes off, it is as different of a monster movie scenes than the previous versions.  This is where the picture shines the best.  It is intense, compelling and wonderfully acted.  The CGI look seemless.  In fact everything that takes place is so intense, you don't notice the audience around you anymore.  Of course for the main two human characters in the film, you don't know who is going to live or not, which was cool.  When the finally leave the island, I thought, ok, the good stuff is over and here comes the stereotypical fish-out-of-water King Kong sceen.  You know, people looking up, screaming, etc.  But you know what, there is nothing stereotypical about this (well, maybe one or two things).  Bravo to Jack Black for playing someone as different as he has previously.  Naomi Watts was her usually outstanding self for the roles she is given.  She has an Oscar coming to her one of these days.  And a very good job for Adrian Brody as well.  I have to warn you, it's not for young kids, at least not for those under the age of 10.  Still today's kids will eat this one up.  And it was well worth the admission price.  It needs to be seen on the big screen because it is good old-style movie making.  Peter Jackson is bonafide big time director.  I don't think Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard could have made a better movie.	5.0	I was most pleasantly surprise	2005-12-19	5	3	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3JD8FDS3CO3GH	FairiesWearBoots8272	There's a part of me that feels a bit guilty proclaiming King Kong my favorite movie of 2005. After all, as a movie buff I'm supposed to favor serious dramatic pictures with important social and human messages or little independent art house movies shot on a minuscule budget. Certainly not a $200 million behemoth about a giant ape crammed with nonstop action sequences and special effects. However, the fact remains: King Kong is my favorite movie of 2005. I can be biased against big-budget movies as I'm sure a lot of movie buffs are, however what ultimately matters is not the size of the budget or number of special effects shots. Small-budget indie movies can be very bad, and big-budget Hollywood movies can be very good. What makes the difference is the passion and craftsmanship on display. The interest and love that the filmmakers have for the material and the ability to pull it off. With Peter Jackson's King Kong there is not a single frame on the screen in its 187-minute duration that lacks passion or craftsmanship. This is a very personal movie for Peter Jackson, perhaps even more personal than The Lord of the Rings. While watching the movie you can almost see nine-year-old Peter pretending to film Kong climbing the Empire State Building in his backyard. In reality, Jackson is 44 and the backyard is now a huge New Zealand movie set, however the passion is still there. King Kong is not your typical action/special effects movie. If it were, it would not even make my favorite movies list, much less top it. This is an action/special effects movie helmed by Peter Jackson. The man who made it possible for a special effects/fantasy film to sweep the Academy Awards. It should be no surprise that his latest is more than just flashy brain candy.King Kong is a success both as epic spectacle and dramatic storytelling. Essentially it's a love story between a woman and a 25-foot ape. The fact that the woman actually has chemistry with the ape is only one of this movie's wonders. The film contains some of the most amazing sights you're likely to see on the motion picture screen, but never at the expense of drama and characterization. It has moments that are genuinely moving, for example one scene towards the end involving Ann Darrow and Kong on a frozen pond. It has moments that are frightening, such as the second act on Skull Island where Carl Denham and crew encounter any type of slimy oversized beast you could imagine. It has thrills and lots of them. The Skull Island scenes have some of the most astonishing action sequences anyone has seen. Even when the movie seems to be turning into Jurassic Park 4, Peter Jackson always manages to put something new and refreshing on the screen. He consciously avoids showing the dinosaurs in a familiar way. Each time a new dino appears on the screen, Jackson utilizes  it in a way that we've never seen before. Kong's fight with multiple T-Rexes is sure to go down in cinematic history along with the epic battle from Jackson's Return of the King. The final act of the film, in which Kong is brought captive to New York City, is as spectacular as anything on Skull Island. If you've seen the 1933 film, or even if you haven't, you know what happens but it is still an incredible, very moving finale. The whole Empire State Building sequence is just amazing.Much will be said about the actors in King Kong. I think most everyone will agree that Naomi Watts is superb as Ann Darrow, doing justice to Fay Wray in the original. There will be some dispute over whether or not Jack Black was right for the role of Carl Denham and I will say that I don't think he was the best choice. However, Jack truly does his best and I think he gives an admirable performance even if he does seem to be a little bit out of his league. I was pretty pleased with Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll as well. No complaints. The real star of the movie, however is Kong. Given life by Andy Serkis (Gollum in Lord of the Rings), Kong is a true marvel. Here is a giant 25-foot computer-generated ape that actually gives a believable and quite moving performance. It really must be seen to be believed. In any of the closeups of Kong's face, you will in no way be aware that you are looking at a special effect. Quite a tremendous accomplishment by Andy Serkis and the effects team at WETA.With all of my praise, I do not think King Kong is a perfect movie. It has a few little problems here and there, but for me at least, they did not detract from the movie going experience at all. A lot of people will say that the movie is too long, running a meaty three hours. I think the lengthy running time suits it just fine. This is an epic story and the extra hour allows Jackson time to flesh out his world with details and extra character development that make all the difference in creating a real film instead of just a special effects picture. Also, although I think second act of the film is utterly amazing, it does go a little bit overboard with the creepy crawly creatures. We expect lots of dangerous animal life, but in addition to the dinosaurs we have a giant carnivorous snail-type creature, killer bats, giant spiders and all sorts of huge man-eating insects. After a while it becomes creature overkill which is cool, but slightly redundant. A few less monsters would have been fine. This portion of the movie also does strain credibility at times. I really don't think that you could shoot giant insects off another guy's back with a machine gun without shooting him. Act two does require some suspension of disbelief.Even with those quibbles, King Kong is a spectacular movie. I would highly recommend it to everyone except perhaps small children. The Skull Island scenes will be very frightening to kids. Movie lovers of all ages will find much to love in this beautiful, touching and exciting update of Merian C. Cooper's classic story of beauty and the beast. It is another triumph for director Peter Jackson and one of the best movies of 2005.As for the Extended Edition, well this is King Kong, not Lord of the Rings. The movie is not improved by the extra scenes. I would recommend sticking with the theatrical version, although there are some very worthwhile extras on that DVD set if you're willing to shell out the cash.	5.0	"One ""King"" to rule them all.....

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2V6T24IY09M0X	Felix Felicis	"When Meriam Cooper first used stop motion effects way back in 1933 to engineer the tale of a fearsome giant ape named Kong, the world was amazed. In 1976, the animatronic attempt at a remake fell flat, largely because the filmmakers added little of their own vision and substance to the tale. The thought that ran through my mind the first time we witness Kong in Peter Jackson's superb remake was simply, ""I wish Cooper were still alive to see this today.""Peter Jackson has again accomplished the impossible, by taking a familar piece of pop culture widely known and recrafting it in his own stunning vision. ""King Kong"" is the distillation of Jackson's boyhood ideals and adult mastery of craft, all combined with the most advanced digital technology possible, to create a masterpiece. He has taken the best elements of the previous films and added even more (perhaps a little too much more), and the result is a sight to behold. However, because Jackson is not merely content with spectacle for its own sake, the experience is much more satisfying and certainly more emotional. Perhaps truly for the first time ever, Kong lives, and he is King.Our ill-fated tale begins with Ann Darrow (a radiant Naomi Watts), an attractive and ambitious vaudeville comedian struggling to make ends meet in Depression Era New York. She harbors a desire to become an actress, which she is forced to persue when her act is shut down. But playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), whose work she admires, wants no part of her. Without ever meeting him, she is convinced to seek an alternate career instead (one involving copious amounts of nudity - sadly, this isn't ""Mulholland Drive"").Enter one Carl Denham (Jack Black), a slicker-than-grease director who can't quite get his monster film to work, and when the studio pulls the plug, he grabs his PA, the camera, and the film canisters and runs. He has a map to a mysterious place called Skull Island (should be an ominous sign, no?), and he figures if he can find an actress and a ship that'll get him there, he'll get the best possible location and make tons of dough. The famous and gifted Jack Driscoll is writing the story, after all. Well, soon he runs into Ann, and hoodwinks the captain AND the playwright (and of course Ann and the clueless lead actor and ship crew) into going along, just before the sirens come calling.And so our intrepid voyagers set sail. This occurs in the first hour of the film, and we are introduced to more of the crew and get familiar with our characters and how they operate before the violence begins. A warrant has been issued over the radio for Denham's arrest, and the captain is furious and plans to turn back. However, it is too late - they are enshrouded by the fog and they crash directly into Skull Island. As Denham and the crew film in what they believe to be an uninhabited place, they are attacked by the creepy (and I mean creepy) natives. What happens after I will not reveal in great detail, but safe to say there is a lot of roaring and chest-pounding involved.The digital Kong created by Andy Serkis and the wizards at WETA digital is as close to a real creature as possible onscreen. He always seems to occupy the same space as our characters, and his movement, look (is that real hair???), and uncanny emotion all make him completely believable. Jackson makes the choice to have Ann and Kong develop a two-way relationship, and as strange a choice as it sounds, it nonetheless works marvelously. You can't help but feel a little sad when the inevitable conclusion comes, if only because you understand Kong and empathize with Ann. That is the major triumph of this picture, and that is why I feel it superior to the two previous attempts to bring Wallace's novel to the big screen.But it is not the only triumph- this is, after all, an action film. And what thrilling action it is! As soon as our heroes hit the Island, all hell breaks lose. Vicious dinosaurs, disgusting and horrifyingly LARGE insects, and the power of Kong himself - in sequence after sequence. Although the film succeeds because it takes the time to have quiet moments, many will see ""King Kong"" primarily for the louder ones, and it doesn't disappoint. The demolition wrecked on the meticulously recreated 1930's New York city is particularly entertaining to me. Jackson lets his fertile imagination go wild here, and it pays big dividends for the audience.And the actors acquit themselves superbly as well. Naomi Watts plays Ann as thoughtful, resourceful, and slightly over-emotional, choices that work in the throwback context of the film while also keeping her grounded (and easy to identify with) as a character. Her job of acting against Serkis or interacting with the digital Kong is difficult and thankless, but because of her considerable acting talent it is also mostly seamless. Adrien Brody is better here than in anything else he's done since winning that Oscar, and Jack Black is...well, Jack Black. In a role that seems to have been written specifically to suit his gifts, Black is always funny as the frequently smug and sneaky Denham, but also reveals the depth in his character in his unending drive to exploit others for the sake of his own personal gain, including Kong. And though the supporting actors are mostly non-descript, considering the genre that's not such a bad thing. Even the last minute replacement score by James Newton Howard seems directly from the 30's - appropriate for the tone Jackson is shooting for - and even borrows some familiar cues from the original (with many other loving digs and homages to be found).So, minus a few not-quite-finished effects shots and a some (intentionally) hokey 30's dialogue, this epic version ""King Kong"" delivers on every level you ever could want of an adventure flick. Peter Jackson has often said the original ""King Kong"" is what made him want to make movies in the first place, and after marveling at his own vision it's not hard to see why. By taking the time and effort to flesh out the characters and story first, and then applying the same care to the technological aspects, the film becomes more; it becomes a full-bodied experience. And a hair-tingling one, at that."	5.0	One word - astonishing.	2005-12-16	3	3	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2FBE4V6BCRGIF	"FilmGeek ""FilmG"""	Now this is interesting: is Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' worth all the hype?  In short, yes! However the film has many issues that keep it from becoming an amazing accomplishment along the lines of, say 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or even 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, which dominated almost a decade of Jackson's life before.Let's start with the fun part.  The movie has some of the most spectacular and breathtaking effects ever put on the screen. (I'm not one for CGI, so it says alot if a film really wows me.)  This film jumps from action sequence to action sequence at a breakneck pace, throwing the audience into visual assualt after visual assault.  By the end of each sequence, I was out of breath.We begin our story in New York City of the 1930s-- one of the best visions of a past New York ever filmed. It's almost surreal, the images of the Great Depression, and they stick with you well into the movie. (The film was shot in New Zealand.)  We meet the beautiful Ann Darrow, (Naomi Watts) as she performs her vaudville act in front of a trickling crowd. Box office income is low, and soon, she's out on the street. (Let me also say, that Naomi Watts gives one of her best performances here, and she's absolutely adorable as the 'Beauty' in this tale.)  Fate intervenes when she meets a young filmmaker, Carl Denham (Jack Black, unusually surpressed.) He despretely needs a leading lady in his new film he's shooting and when he sees Ann, he decides she's the girl for the role. Ann joins Denham on the ship 'Venture' with an assortment of characters who'll be introduced, and most will be ultimately forgotten. We meet Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) who is the writer of the movie they're filming. There is a love connection between Jack and Ann, but they never fall TOO in love, because the real love story is between her and Kong.Carl Denham and company reach an island consisting of dense fog and harsh stones and foliage: Skull Island.  After an hour, the film kicks into high gear at this point.  After a terrifying navigation through jagged rocks and smashing waves, the crew of the Venture go ashore and are almost killed by hostile natives who want to give Ann to Kong as a prize. Ann is taken by the 25 foot gorrilla and is subjected to what can only be described as visceral whiplash as Kong runs through the jungle.Skull Island is beautifully concieved: a place time has forgotten and dinosaurs thought long-extinct still roam free. Giant apes used to rule the jungle, but now Kong seems to be the last one alive. He is now the king of the jungle.  The crew of the Venture must survive stampedes and attacks from raptors, bugs - (LOTS of bugs, not for the squeamish!)-  and yes, Kong himself.  Kong, we understand, loves Ann. He'd do anything to protect her, but he doesn't care much for Ann's other human counterparts.  Jack Driscoll takes it upon himself to bring Ann back, when everyone else gives up.Carl Denham decides to bring Kong back to New York. He becomes almost a villian -(well, he's responsible, no?)- when Kong - you guessed it - escapes and terrorizes the city.  He grabs his love, and ascends to the summit of the Empire State Building.We know the rest.  Back to those 'issues' I told you about. The main problem is the film's length. At 3 hours and 7 minutes, you begin to wonder why they couldn't cut some stuff. A little cosmetic surgery can go a long way.  There are, like I said, characters and subplots that come and go with no payoff, such as Jimmy the Cabin boy (Jamie Bell) and his relationship with Mr. Hayes (Evan Parke). There is also a subplot that ties in with the book 'Heart of Darkness' that ends up being nothing.The movie does however follow the 'Jaws' rule: it doesn't show a single monster for a little over an hour. It works better this way, so when we first see Kong, it's so powerful and terrifying. There are amazing scenes, quiet scenes between Ann and Kong, that you really start to see Kong as a character.  Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, is again using the incredible technology 'motion capture' to provide animators with the 'performance' of the Kong character. It's amazing, and the Academy needs to nominate Serkis for his work (although they never will, chuckle.)All in all, I expect everyone to know the story.  But that doesn't diminish the journey that Peter Jackson and the awesome WETA Workshop has  created.  Next time, I think Peter Jackson should slow it down for awhile.	4.0	King Kong: A Delicate Balance Between Amazing and Too Much...	2006-02-14	15	10	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A31SY8FEXFD0DQ	Flabbage of Jabbich	"I was looking for this film in the extended cut, and thought I would read the 1 star ratings of this movie in case of bad quality discs, cases, etc... and instead came upon the elitist musings of some really weird people.Comparing this film to the 1933 original is like comparing a Model T to my 1999 SC300.  It is ridiculous at its core, and though all are entitled to their opinion, to lambaste this zoological CGI wonderland as some sort of cheap knock off is dull at best.  Take your mother to the grocery store first and give it a think before you write another movie review.One dude actually said the facial expressions of the 1976 Kong were better than Jackson's Kong. That may be one of the dumbest things I have ever read, and the author cannot be serious, save some sort of neurotic ""opposite"" disorder. I am a lifelong zoologist who is as big a stickler for CGI animal movement in movies that there is.  Realism is everything, and it gets better all the time.  At the TOP of the craft is Peter Jackson and WETA.Another douche crowed about how fake the animals looked, and referred to it as ""two movies clumsily put together"", or something to that effect.  This is drivel, obviously written by someone who knows ZERO about animal morphology or behavior.The animals in Jackson's Kong look fantastic, and to say otherwise is nothing short of a glaring testimony to one's lack of knowledge on the subject.  When one says they look fake, when they don't at all, it implies (to me anyway) that you wish us to believe you have some perception the rest of us lack. When in reality it is just the opposite.I could write for days about how stupid some of the reasons and rationalizations given for giving this film 1 star were, but I won't.  I just wanted to tip some of you off, so you could go read a couple of these reviews and wonder, as I did, what the heck these sniveling little movie snob weasels are thinking.  It is truly bizarre.This movie is not perfect by any stretch, however.  Some scenes are too long, and it takes too long for Kong to enter. Black failed in his attempt to utter the famous final line, and in my opinion, his character should have died a dramatic Kong death, like Grodin did in 1976.But I don't enjoy second guessing Peter Jackson, one of Gods gifts to cinema."	5.0	An Insight Into Insanity - 1 Star Ratings	2013-04-29	3	2	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A7TD4K92N6QTV	"fleastime ""macmilosixtynine"""	"I won't rehash territory discussed by others.  The film is visually exciting, well-orchestrated, and worth watching--a good action-adventure.  The good points are otherwise well-covered in other reviews here.  The main point that really detracts from the film overall is the lack of coherency on the famed mysterious island.  Apparently one of those territories that breed oversized and/or mutated animals, such as the radioactive waters from which the Japanese Godzilla emerged, director Jackson has no issues with mixing species and time periods on his dark island, where he has oversized centipedes cohabiting the island alongside Jurassic Park veterans (T-Rexes and so forth), while Kong of course is just a giant modern day gorilla.  Why are there no other giant gorillas on the island (where's mom and dad, brother and sister?), why, for that matter, are there no other giant JUNGLE creatures, of any form, and instead, why is the island pretty well populated with all kinds of familiar DINOSAURS?!  And, of all the choices of animals to bring back to ""civilization"", where choices include a host of these millions of years long dead dinosaurs, giant insects, never-before-seen fish, etc.--why did they choose to bring back a rather mundane, albeit giant, gorilla, of all choices?  If Jackson had established some sort of believability of his island inhabitants, we would not have had these problems.  He could have had one really big gorilla, amongst maybe some others of large but not gigantic stature, and thus, we could have seen why the island natives worshipped/feared Kong and none of the other animals (such as the equally fearful T-Rexes).  By succumbing to big scene excitement (eye-candy--hold the sensibility), while ignoring any kind of believability issues, he reduced his chances at creating a truly magnificent movie, and ended up creating just one more in a long line of action adventures, where you are forced to leave your brains at home, and as a result, ends up not being high on the list of movies to see again.  It didn't have to be this way--King Kong ""coulda, shoulda"" been better--why not an exciting movie that actually makes sense as well?"	3.0	Coulda, Shoulda	2008-06-14	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AS62A5MC52IEH	Floyd the Barber	"Anybody who's seen and appreciated the original will be unpleasantly surprised by this ""cover.""  It seems that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have set the bar remarkably low for film directors:  after initial success (or even before) one must remake old movies, either as new ""takes"" on old formulae (a la Indiana Jones or the Star Wars pap) or actual (odious) remakes of original classics.  This is one of the latter.  In this remake of a classic-never-to-be-remade, Peter Jackson pleasures himself and his investors at our expense. But because Jackson apparently knows only what a dilletante can know about US history and the movie's original context, why it meant what it meant to the movie-going audience of the time, his movie is, plain, flat out, vapid dreck. The only good thing about it is special effects.  Special effects, no real story:  that's a circus, folks.Jack Black, whose limitations as any kind of a legitimate actor show embarrassingly in this shipwreck, is terribly miscast as Carl Denham: the character he portrays, miles from the original, should have been eaten early on by one of the giant leeches of Skull Island:  as an actor, the recess bell has no tyet rung from the ""School of Rock.""  Carl Denham, like Anne Darrow, in the original, was a creature of the Depression - as was Kong.  (Jack Driscoll, unlike in this abomination, was a footnote to these principals.  In this he's a moral compass of sorts - a playwright no less! - played with no more than assorted hangdog expressions by Adrian Brody.)  Both Carl and Anne are trying their best not only to survive but to succeed.  Both are creatures of their environment:  both made and unmade by the Depression.  (Denham is a far from a cur in the original: more like a more moral, ethical Trump [Now there's a concept!}.)The Kong of the original was a metaphor for fear come alive and  to terrorize Gotham (and the US) borne right out of the heart of darkness into the ""feast"" of the Great Depression.  (There is some very homage made to Conrad's masterpiece in this movie, but it's a mere, murky obiter dictum.)  Kong was all the force of savagery that threatened to break loose in those harrowing times on the streets of old New York.  His death, much desired by the audience of the time, finally by hapless, unwise Denham, and certainly always by a very threatened Anne, was brought about then state-of-the-art airplanes and the ""top guns"" of the time. In this remake, the plane pilots - and indeed the planes themselves, who, by the way, are characters in any war movie - are mere parodies, portrayed almost as savages themselves.  Anne - maidenhood, motherhood, Lady Liberty, and civilization itself come to life in its most captivating, yet ennervating form - was the promise of renewal, control, ""happier days"" that must be preserved at all costs.  The original, folks, was a grand mythical metaphorical snapshot of the times: it was about saving the girl, killing the monster, and restoring order to a very dark, very threatening world that was the US in the very early Thirties. (If you want to know how dark it was, ask your great-grandfather or great-grandmother or read a book.)  The original Ann did not like it all being taken to the top of the Empire State Building by the oversized ape.  Quite unlike our neurotic maiden in this version, played with rare verve by Naomi Watts.  (Her coming to a rampaging Kong - he just wants his ""tiny dancer,"" dammit! - out of the darkness backlighted has to be one of the ten most ludicrous moments in cinema history.)Peter Jackson seems to be all about ""son et lumiere,"" little more.  Oh he tries to evoke something in the opening montage about the Depression, but it is so caricaturish and forced as if to seem an annoying, necessary preface to project comprehension. (Look, he didn't get the ""Ring"" trilogy either.)Jackson's Kong evolves from the monster that rips ""brides"" from limb to limb to big kid-lug who just loves to watch a harlequin Anne capering - she is so admirably plucky we forget she's with a big, bad limb-from-limb-separating beast, to primal intellectual whose moment of great aesthetic reverie is in watching the sun go down with Anne, to pure intellectual who knows he must die once he's gazed at pure Platonic Beauty. (Oh yes, in this, the sun rises and sets in Anne for Kong:  Kong is on his way to something higher, we just know it.  Hey, just like other apes, he's almost human!)I don't know why Hollywood (and its Aussie and New Zealander coopted creatures) just don't make original movies.  Could it be because they don't have an original thought in their heads?  Because they simply want to make money and trade upon classics they don't get?  Meh.Note to the wise:  avoid this dog which simply wants to separate you from your money."	1.0	Evolution/Devolution	2006-01-02	38	18	20
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2ZB8B7VQONZA6	"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex"""	"KING KONGI remember watching the original Kong film back in the day and every one that followed and could not help but be entertained by every one although the first was the best. I have always enjoyed Kong films and have only rooted against him when he took on the greatest of all time in Godzilla. So after years of nothing new when this film was announced I was actually excited about it when normally I would be like ""oh man they are going to ruin it"". But I had a feeling I was going to like it plus it would introduce Kong to a new audience who may have never watched him before [I will forgive newborns this once but even they should know who Godzilla is, just being born is no excuse for not seeing a Godzilla film]. Of course once I heard Peter Jackson was directing I knew it was in good hands, he was always one of my favorite filmmakers.Of course we all know the story behind Kong and there have been various Kong movies made but  it remains the same. A boat ride to an island while a movie is being made and they happen upon some natives that worship a very large gorilla. Of course that  is the story in the simplest terms because there is much more depth than that. There are love stories going on, an adventure tale and so much more. I think it is that well balanced mix that has made not only the original a classic but this remake as well. I will say from the beginning that I truly believe that this film is indeed a classic remake or not, Peter Jackson did a remarkable job with this film.Failing filmmaker Carl Denham [Jack Black] is looking for something big that will send him into superstardom, he may just have heard of the place to do that but first he must convince some investors to back him. Unfortunately they decline so Carl does what any ambitious person would do, steal everything and go on the run hoping to leave before they can catch him. In doing so he meets a young actress named Ann Darrow [Naomi Watts] and convinces her that she is perfect for the part of his female lead. He also tricks his writer Jack Driscoll [Adrien Brody] into getting stuck on the boat therefore having to go along as well. When they make it to the island [only a few even knew about it] they are surprised by a vicious tribe of natives that want a sacrifice for something very big that lives in the jungle.When Ann is taken by this unseen creature the crew and such go after her going on the adventure of a lifetime. It is during this time that the film switches from a drama into an adventure flick and all kinds of crazy things happen. From giants to creatures to vicious terrain these people must make their way through it to find the girl. Now I am sure that you all know at least that the girl is found and brought back to New York. But there is something else that is brought back with her, and that is the mighty Kong. Kong is brought back to be a tourist attraction and labeled as one of the marvels of the world. But it is here that everything goes sour for everyone in NY and leads to the infamous final scenes of the Kong films involving Kong, a girl, a building, and some planes.I have to say that remake or not this could easily be in the best films of all time and to be honest it could have swept the Oscars and rightfully have done so. But it was not nominated enough in my opinion, it did when 3 for what it was nominated for. The thing I was most surprised at was that Jack Black was not even nominated for best supporting actor, I still think he could have easily won it. Speaking of that the acting in this film is wonderful and fits the time period it is told in. the film has that old school classic Hollywood style and the acting matches it. Like I said Jack Black surprised a lot of people with this film, he did a great job taking his comedic style out and adapting the high energy he gives off in those performances into the maniac he plays in this. Also Adrien Brody does a marvelous job here and gives another career performance here, he was perfectly cast much like Black. Naomi Watts brings that classic Hollywood style to this film and likewise does an excellent job here, she comes off as the classic beauty. Thomas Kretschmann, Colin Hanks, Andy Serkis, Evan Parke and well everyone in this film give excellent performances.Peter Jackson and his fellow writers did an excellent job with this film making it more that just a new age remake that is full of nothing but action. The film is full of multi dimensional characters, action, drama, romance, adventure, and well everything you can think of. The film transitions from comedy to drama during the first part of the film into a voyage film out on the sea into a horror/adventure film on the island, all the way back into a drama and romance flawlessly. It truly is amazing how Jackson and company were able to so with this film and this extended edition only adds to the magical film that is ""King Kong"".This three disc extended addition not only adds to the scenes in the film it also adds to the extras as well. Over three discs we are treated to some of the best special features I have ever seen on any release. There are some of the best behind the scenes and making of features that have ever been released as well as some great additional extras like a short film that the cast made for Jackson for his birthday. That film is also very well done and very funny. Of course there is an excellent commentary by Peter Jackson as well as so much more that only add to the replay value of this release.I highly recommend owning this 3-disc extended edition because not only is the film great but the extras alone make this worth owning. I paid top dollar but now you could find it cheap used or something but I wouldn't let it go. My brother and I watched this again not to long ago and had a great time doing so.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A22UZI0NK0FU31	Frank Q Monk	"Although Peter Jackson is known for big budget extravaganzas, this little art house film may be his finest work yet. It is a brilliant, albeit somewhat obvious, metaphor for American imperialism in the post-Cold War era.Jack Black plays a director who must first ""fight him over there so we don't have to fight him over here."" He uses superior technology to dominate the brutal hairy dictator, then brings him before the world court of public opinion, hoping to bask in the limelight as a true hero.But what is this? The silly monkey doesn't appear to play along. The grand plan for quick victory is torn awry by the easily predicted blowback of a resentful captive.Jackson proves, however, that in the end it's not high ideals or fitting justice that wins out the day. The simple fact is that if you spray enough bullets into enough flesh, eventually they give up and die.Bravo, Mr. Jackson, for this roadmap out of the War on Terror.

The outside mail covering was in perfect shape.  The inside DVDs were intact, but the three DVD holder inside was smashed to totally unusable pieces!  My problem is, in my opinion, that the product had to have been shipped in less than satisfactory condition.  If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, but the outside shipping envelope did not have as much as a tear on it.  CHEESY!I have ordered quite a few DVDs and a few CDs from different companies and have been EXTREMELY satisfied.  This is the first complaining review that has been submitted by me. This package was delivered on May 17, 2011 and has been nagging at me ever since because I cannot find another DVD holder for 3 DVDs -- even if one was available, why should it have to be paid for?It would be nice if BSE ENTERTAINMENT, INC sent me an empty holder for their damaged product.  As of now, the three discs are in three separate DVD holders, which is not satisfying.Sometimes, paying a little more from a company you have dealt with before -- and trust -- is worth it.  Has anyone else out there had this problem with this company.  As stated in the title, It appears from the massive destruction of the holder, that King Kong finally got his revenge!	1.0	KING KONG'S REVENGE	2011-06-25	5	0	5
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1MKYMQIACO09G	Fredrock	... terrible movies the year it was released, Peter Jackson's King Kong showed every other movie director how to make a quality product. Entertaining through and through, this King Kong is a great update of a Hollywood classic like everyone is saying. But it's more than that.There is a scene where Kong is standing in a valley of skeletons - other members of his own species which have fallen vcictim to either the island's other predators or to time itself. It's a simple and beautiful scene, and shows Kong's strength as a survivor, while at the same time revealing his own sadness. The fact that this kind of pity can emanate from a CGI creation is tribute to PJ and to the actor playing Kong (the same actor who gave Gollum life in LOTR.)I kept thinking of that scene when I watched Kong trying to cope with the new jungle he was taken to. Our jungle of New York circa Great Depresseion. Just as dangerous, with cars instead of dinosaurs and planes instead of bats. And the predator known as the human race.I can't wait for Peter Jackson to start making other, more serious movies like historical epics or great dramas (without big apes). Not only do I think he'll do a better job than someone like Ridley Scott, but his two main talents, for visuals and inspiring emotion, will definitely be put to great use.	5.0	Standing atop a heaping pile  of...	2006-04-24	5	5	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2MRZPTMYFADUV	Frodo	"Peter Jackson's passionate remake of ""King Kong,"" is deeply mesmorising and profoundly beautiful, capturing and signifying many of the themes that the original failed to execute to the fullest. There were two things that I was sure about when going into this film; firstly that Peter Jackson, being a devoted fan of the original would honour it through his brilliant film-making abilities;, and secondly, that it would NOT be his finest achievement.A phenomenon like ""Lord of the Rings,"" Jackson's critically- acclaimed, and multi-Oscar-honoured masterpiece, only comes round once in a blue moon, so I knew before watching it that ""King Kong,"" would not surpass such perfection. I think this is where ""King Kong,"" perhaps hasn't been given the full credit it deserves. It will forever lie in the shadow, and therefore always be compared to ""Lord of the Rings.""But Jackson's remake of ""King Kong,"" IS successful in one monumental way, in that it finally puts the term ""movie remake,"" in an honourable perspective. The flaw with director's trying to literally REMAKE an old classic, is that the new, technilogically-advanced version will try and be BETTER than the original. To me however, the remake of a film as iconic as ""King Kong,"" should be done so the next generation has the opportunity to appreciate why the original was so adored in the first place.And this is where Jackson REALLY succeeds. With care, this film is visually, musically, and emotionally charged, allowing audiences to not only appreciate it as one film, but appreicate the original's profound beauty. I liked Naomi Watts' portrayal of Anne Darrow. She has the ability to transport messages and feelings through her expressive eyes. The idea of emotion through eyes is one the main aspects of the film, as King Kong himself is projected through his incredible expressions (accentuated by the genius that is Andy Serkis of ""LOTR's"" Gollum fame). I loved the chemistry between Anne and Jack (Adrien Brody), whose relationship is romantic and tranquil. Their scene on top of the Empire State building was a part I found particularly lovely.The idea that Kong falls in love with Anne is one of the themes that this version signifies clearer than the original. In the original, the theme is implied but not, in my opinion, properly executed. Peter Jackson takes special care to build up their bond, making their heartbreaking final minutes on top of the Empire State all the more tragic. In turn, it also emphasises the film's infamous central idea; ""It wasn't the airplanes, it was Beauty killed the Beast."" Essentially, Kong loved Anne so much, that he sacraficed himself. In my view, this film couldn't have done a finer job in honouring this theme.The other successes of this film is its technical and musical attributes. The special effects are sublime, and truly state-of-the-art. They say the only way to bring New York to the screen is to film New York itself. But Jackson's virtual New York City had a certain athereal quality to it. The creation of Kong himself is revolutionary and visual effects Oscar the film garnered was more than deserved. May I also add that this film won 3 out of 3 Oscars, so those who say this film was ""snubbed,"" aren't being completely honest.James Newton Howard's score is captivating and haunting. I bought the soundtrack and it really is one of my favourites. The love theme for Anne and Kong is tranquil, and the music expressing Kong's famous fall to his death is heart-wrenching.Now to the one major flaw that prevents me from giving this film the 5 stars it REALLY SHOULD have; the lack of editing and therefore its length. Now, I am all for long movies. In fact judging by past films, the longer the film the better. ""Titanic,"" ""Gone With the Wind,"" and yes, ""Lord of the Rings"" are all three hour plus movies with Best Picture Oscars under there belt. But where ""Lord of the Rings"" used every last minute to tell the enormous story that is the Tolkein trilogy, ""King Kong,"" is weighed down by a blatant abuse of ideas and creativity where the concept of ""less is more"" was not appreciated. The section dedicated to the voyage to Skull Island was far too long and drawn out. Likewise, the endless sequences once we finally get to the island, however exciting and brilliantly made, are just too overwhelming. At LEAST forty-five minutes could have been easily shaved. For two thirds, we are given too much on our plate that by the final and most important third, we are too warn out to really care. It's just such a shame, because the final forty-five minutes are so iconic, and so beautiful.Nevertheless, I DID love Peter Jackson's ""King Kong,"" because, with the exception of its lack of editing, it is immaculately made, right down to the very last battle scar on Kong's giant body. This is the best remake around, providing a vivid reconstruction of the original masterpiece. No, it is not ""Lord of the Rings,"" but with a fine cast, stunning special effects, beautiful music and emotion that with grind at the heartstrings, Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" is one hell of film."	4.0	Four and a half stars.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	"The 1933 KING KONG was very much ""state of the art"" and then some for its era, a great financial success, and even as special effects have advanced it has remained a great favorite.  A 1976 version proved popular at the box office, but seemed to leave a sour taste in the audience's mouth, falling out of favor as soon as it ended its theatrical run; nonetheless, many studios and directors have been attracted to the idea of a third remake over the years.  After demonstrating his mastery of CGI blockbusters with THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, director Peter Jackson got the green light.Although there have been more than a few tweaks, the basic story remains the same.  Producer-Director Carl Denham (Jack Black) is desperate for an actress to appear in a semi-documentary film, and he lures down-on-her-luck Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) into joining him on an expedition to an uncharted island.  Along the way, Ann falls in love with Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody)--but when the party arrives at Skull Island she finds herself beloved by the tallest, darkest leading man in film history.On the surface, the film has a lot going for it.  Rather than update the film, Jackson elected to set it in the early 1930s, and the images of period New York are impressive; so too are the CGI effects from start to finish.  But it rapidly turns into too much of a good thing.  Jackson seems to feel that if one was good in the original film, then three or more will better--and so once we arrive on Skull Island we have herds of dinosaurs, not to mention a host of really nasty insects and some equally foul bats-like creatures.  A great many people have said it looks more like a video game than a movie, and the criticism is dead on target.If the CGI is wildly overdone, the film also suffers from a  script that saddles Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody with a certain goody-goody-gumdrops quality--and to add insult to injury calls for Jack Black, in what must be the most totally unappealing performance of the past decade, to stand around with narrowed eyes and a shifty expression.  He looks more like a dope dealer on the lam than a documentary film maker, and his every scene is both tired and tiresome beyond all possible description.But the ultimate killer, in my opinion any way, is the film's total lack of innocence.  It's a 1933 story remade in 2005 but dressed up in 1933 clothes--and it doesn't have the conviction of its costuming.  I didn't believe any of it, not for a single CGI-laden minute.  So far as mindless eye candy goes, the 2005 KING KONG is (Jack Black excepted) reasonably entertaining, but it really doesn't have any content to set it apart from the rest of the CGI pack, and I can't imagine that it will be remembered any more fondly than the largely forgotten 1976 version.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"	3.0	Mindless Eye Candy and CGI Overkill	2006-06-04	13	10	3

We all know the story of King Kong, especially the infamous final scene, but this film kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The rewrite of the story incorporates era specific dialogue and scenes and events left out of the original. It manages to stay faithful to the original intent, while modernizing it at the same time. The special effects are absolutely fantastic. This movie is a must see and an instant classic.	5.0	Peter Jackson is King!	2005-12-16	2	2	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3M5O6UHXO9IBU	Gary	"There seems to be a cult of the personality surrounding Mr Jackson; some fans actually describing him as their `beloved'. Certainly, the three hour plus running time practically screams: ""I'm an auteur. Respect me.""Remember the days when men were men in the movies? Burton paired with Eastwood. Lee Marvin in anything. Jackson's art-house pretensions to deconstruct masculinity works against an adventure narrative. I'm surprised Kong even had any hair on him. The captain or first mate of the original 1933 production is relegated to a supporting role and is tainted with colonialist ambivalence and shiftiness. He is even given a ticking off by 'beauty' for having the temerity to try to rescue her (at the expense of many male and therefore worthless lives.) Her `other' suitor is now an introverted writer whom the director doesn't even know what to do with in the final act in New York. His search for the hero inside himself leaves us scratching our heads as we're not entirely sure what he is trying to do in that car. This is followed by a bizarre non-rescue of the heroine. Kong himself is emasculated to the point where he has to hide behind the skirts of a women as she defends her helpless hirsute boyfriend against the rat-a-tat fire of bourgeois society (and by implication us for the ""price of a ticket."") Beastiality, it seems, is the only refuge from a venal world of weak men and rough traders. Even a cabin boys rite of passage is pointedly allowed to go nowhere. Curiously, in one shot on the island, Jackson shows Darrow staring at Denham, as if to imply she views the impresario as the urban doppelganger of Kong, driven by obsession. In which case, if they are one and the same, why did she dump Denham on the return to New York only to take up with Kong anyway? Clearly, this was not self sacrifice to save others under threat. She is besotted with the beast to a degree that is unsavoury, not to mention frequently ridiculous. The suspense of the original, that is, will beauty escape the ferocious beast, is dispensed with resulting in a limp conclusion.In the final quarter, Jackson seems to be striving for the poetic with the internal monologue of his sissy suitor but the material doesn't countenance it. The real poetry resides in the final line but as Beauty has obviously spent the picture trying to save Kong and Jackson has been pointing the finger of blame at everyone else, including the audience, it lacks resonance. Kong is the second Aslan of the month, crucified for our sins. I preferred the unreconstructed chauvinist of the original. He was a bit of a `jerk', but a lot more fun. Curiously, Jackson's message is far more reactionary than the original's. Don't take no for an answer, slap her about a bit and you'll win fair maiden's heart. Besides, isn't all this revisionism and finger wagging at false male values a tad hypocritical amongst all the drawn out fight sequences, which are little more than adverts for the video game version appealing to the testosterone in teenage boys?Just where is the fun meant to be here? Can't men just be men anymore? America was built on the pioneer spirit after all. Cynics might say it was built on racism, genocide and exploitation but it really wouldn't hurt to have an adventure story with a little less ambivalence in the trouser department. History is littered with charismatic explorers.Kong `nicely' rounds off a wretched year for film. Faced with this pretentious, bloated, badly directed and violent bore, we return to Conrad in a way perhaps not intended by the film-makers with a plaintive cry of: ""the horror! The horror!"" followed in quick succession by the more personal, ""when the hell is it all going to end?"""	1.0	A disaster	2005-12-16	22	11	11
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ABN7HB7T27GIW	"Gary Pants ""movie obsesser 2121"""	King Kong: a remake, action, drama, thriller, comedy, epic 3 hour film. Only Peter Jackson could hold an audience's attention for 3 whole hours. The communication between Kong and Ann is very cool and funny. Naomi Watts is great in this, but the real star is KING KONG!! His realistic movement and expression is amazing. The effects are great! Best I've seen... ever. You can surely tell that Peter Jackson was the director just by the way he films and shows the landscape. He gives us an amazing visual experience that only he could accomplish.I saw the advanced screening of this and it wore me out. The first part has Jack Black's character Carl Denham, Naomi Watts as Ann Darow and Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll. They are all hurried by Carl to Skull Island on a ship. They eventually arrive at Skull Island in a storm. Literally. They crash into some rocks in arrival and there is some nice wave effects.They are greeted by a poor island kid whom Carl offers some chocolate but no, an entire civilization appears with spears ready to attack. The make up of these islanders is hideous but very cool and gets the audiences' attention. Ann is taken captive by the natives in a very dark and exciting way but not so much memorable since it is outdone by the next 2 hours. She is lowered to the ground in a way that will amaze you. Kong shows up and is attracted to Ann. This relationship between human and creature has never been done on such a level. As she is being held by a massive gorilla running through the island's jungles the rest of the shipmates are preparing a rescue. There is soon a parade of giant dinosaurs trampling over the ship's crew. Many different types of dinosaurs and creatures are included in the next few action scenes. The part where Kong fights the crew on the large log is classic. Seriously the fights scenes from here after are just too good. I feel like I should have paid more. I'll just have to see it again. Carl and Jack fight some giant bugs including spiders and grasshoppers. Kong fighting three T-Rexes while not only grasping Ann by his hand and sometimes foot- they are falling down a cliff to be saved by some vine ropes. Then Kong finally hits the ground to protect Ann once again in a wrestling match. After all of this I'm suprised Ann has not thrown up from motion sickness. The capture of King Kong is incredibly better than I expected and my expectations are always high in movies. There are some emotional moments for Ann here as she is in love with both guys who saved her life.Finally, after all of this comes the return to New York City. It has King Kong chained up on stage for hundreds of people to view. Then he gets angry. Kong bascically destroys the entire theater I thought he'd just make a run for it to Ann and then the Empire State Building. Rampaging around New York lifting cars, buses, and women who look like Naomi Watts but never finding her, King Kong finds his grumpy side again. Ann finds him and they share some stares into each others eyes. The finale scene atop the Empire State building is just grand. The whole build-up, the planes, the height, the fall, my God; the height!!!Overall, King Kong is for sure the best movie this year. Each action scene out does the one prior. The characters are emotionally convincing. The ending is sad even though it has been done time and time again. The action has never been done on this level. The Lord of the Rings is just as great a movie, but isn't at all like King Kong. They are entirely different. Compared to the 1933 version, King Kong is faithful in plot. Many of the lines stay the same also. King Kong will be adored by audiences there will be applause. Best Movie!! Must See!!	5.0	Beautiful	2005-12-15	3	2	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AZAEJB1ECT9HC	Gary P. Cohen	"I, like almost everyone else, watched the original King Kong on tv while growing up and enjoyed it greatly.  I still marvel at what they were able to accomplish in this film way back in 1933.  However while I admire the orginal Kong, I absolutely love Peter Jackson's remake and consider it a masterpiece.First of all, this is a film that must be seen on a big screen.  I saw it twice in the movies and watched the blu-ray today on my 52 inch tv.  It still loses something although the picture and sound are crystal clear.I love everything about this film from the incredible job Jackson and the Production Designers did in recreating 1932 New York City to the masterful job the special effects technicians did on Kong and the incredible emotions that they were able to show on his face.  The action scenes are incredible especially a wild Brontasaurus stampede, a battle between Kong (while holding Naomi Watts in his hand) and 3 Tyranasaurus Rexes and the final confrontation between Kong at the top of the Empire State Building and about 10 World War 1 byplanes.  (The high-up shot of Kong falling off the building with several planes flying high above him was so beautifully done that it actually made me queasy while watching it in the movies.) The three leads are excellent: Naomi Watts, absolutely lovely as Ann Darrow and boy can she run, Adrien Brody, not exactly your average leading-man, but very good as Jack Driscoll and Jack Black, an actor that I don't usually care for, perfect as Carl Denham.  (Perhaps since Denham is basically a despicable character in this film, the fact that I do not like Jack Black made this perfect casting.)The additional scenes on this blu-ray are excellent and never should have been cut: a vicious triceratops attack and a terrific and scary scene involving a vicious underwater creature picking the men off as they are rafting through the jungle.  (I can't imagine how much hard work went into this sequence, only for it to be cut.)  The music for this film by James Newton Howard is excellent, the Oscar winning special effects almost beyond belief.This film did not do all that well during its Christmas release, it was soundly beaten by the first ""Narnia"" movie.  Thats too bad because I consider it to be a masterpiece and can't imagine how difficult it must have been to make.  But then again Peter Jackson had plenty of experience making difficult films since he made this one right after completing the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, 3 epic films that I look forward to seeing released on blu-ray also."	5.0	A Masterpiece	2010-02-16	4	2	2

It transported me to a time when I was a child, filled with wonder and bursting to acquire new experiences that would tickle my imagination. As an adult, it's much rarer that I might find something that fills me with such delight - but King Kong did it for me. This is a first-rate adventure tale with everything I could hope for. A lost island, filled with prehistoric beasts and monsters, a fascinating cast of characters (special recognition for Jack Black), and of course, the giant ape himself (marvelously realized by the motion capture of Andy Serkis). I realize special effects aren't everything, nor do they make a movie... but in this movie, those special effects really are SPECIAL, pulling off some incredible imagery that made my heart race and my eyes bulge. When I was watching King Kong battle with multiple T-Rexes, I immediately decided that I needed to acquire a larger TV, this spectacle was so awesome. More importantly, none of it ever stands out as being ""fake"" or overly CGI- it blends in perfectly, which to me is the sign of artists who take great pride in their work. This is one of the best adventure movies I've ever seen, if not the very best, and one that should delight imaginative viewers of all ages."	5.0	This is the movie that convinced me to buy a big screen TV!	2013-09-30	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A27QOWKF0BKD6P	gencus	"There still is only one King Kong, and he's alive and well in the new dvd release of the 1933 Willis O'Brien masterpiece.As for this mess, I'm sick of seeing computer animated digital paintings being passed off as the new generation of movie magic. Reducing characters and settings to polygons and texture maps does not make them look real, they just look like moving oil paintings.  Less an improvement over past techniques than a cheaper, faster alternative, at best it's a lateral move in a less aesthetically desirable direction. CGI exists nowhere else but the flat screen; clearly, and it shows just that, it's FLAT,  as in ""lacking depth"", which is why such images also lack a sense of life and are instantly forgettable. The objects used to create these virtual images will never be romaticized or sought after by collectors, nor enshrined in movie museums.  They can't be, because they don't exist in the real world.  CGI carries none of an artist's physical touch, nor the resonance of imagery recorded when real objects and characters go before the camera. Because of that, these transient virtually created images will never achieve the kind of legendary status that decades of real cinematic craft have given us, and that, decades after their premieres, are still loved and idolized.The most obvious example here would be the original ""Kong"", over 70 years old and rightly idolized by Peter Jackson.Which is why I can't understand how Jackson, a fervent Kong fan, could (digitally) render such a pile of poo. Jackson may be tantamount to a god for legions of fans, but I have never understood why.  A certain ""Ring"" trilogy literally put me to sleep before I could make it through the first installment, and I find this bitter pill just as hard to swallow.This ""KONG"" is no fun--worse, it's tedious and overwrought.  It comes off like meatloaf, so packed with fillers and extenders that the finished work barely resembles it's origins, or it's original intentions. If I had been alone for the viewing of this tired body I would have fled 30 minutes into the thing.  As I was unable to escape, I found myself fidgeting constantly, and realized I was actually pulling at my hair and grinding my teeth when being force fed such empty calories as Jamie Bell's whiny sea boy struggling with what it means to be a hero (who cares, kid? Why is your character taking up screen time? Did I just answer my own question?) or the many ""dramatic"" zooming closeups of Evan Parke as he's imparting some crapball of quiet seafarin' wisdom that's been written for him to say, or enduring yet another unnecessary and ridiculous digital Dinos Gone Wild segment(there are MANY of these to choose from, just pick your favorite fictionalized silly species--prehistoric vampire bats, anyone? How about an ""exciting"" mid-air battle involving not one, but THREE T-Rex wannabees?.How 'bout that beyond extreme Skull Island native population, who, from the look of their surroundings, must actually be located not on a lush South Seas island, but on a rocky alien planet completely devoid of shelter, plant life, color, or a detectable source of food?  Wait-what with all those human bones lying around, are we now supposed to think that they have been AMPED UP like every other element of this travesty so they are now scary CANNIBALS? Oh, brother. And why do the native islanders all look like caucasians who were literally doused in Hershey's chocolate syrup? Is that why they're all so mad?And HOW many TIMES do we have to see a sweeping helicopter shot of that damn boat?  I get it already, they're on a mysterious voyage aboard a tramp steamer. Nobody's sure how it's all gonna end up, there's an island full of skulls, we're all so scared, blah, blah, blah.  Roll end credits, please.The list of offenses goes on and on and on, but I've got a date to view the real Kong and his yet-to-be-matched leading lady. Sorry, Ms. Watts seemed earnest enough, but, well, at least she tried. Just don't make me have to sit and watch her exchange drawn out, longing, deeply meaningful glances with either Adrien Brody or a piece of CGI ever, ever again. I'd tolerate another viewing of the awful 1976 version before I would endure three hours of this again. At least the '76 version is redeemed by Rick Baker's genius. Real actor in a real costume, real rubber, real hair, real light striking a real surface. NO motion capture needed. That ape is no less convincing, just un-real in a different, less offensive way.I'll close by saying that if you like movies with miscast lead actors (why does Jack Black have a career?) and specifically movies which contain lots and lots of flat, fast-moving but lifeless, often strobe-y video game effects, then you will certainly call this ""entertainment"".Oh, yeah, did I mention that nearly every scene was apparently steeped in orangey tea for an irritating, patently tweaked honey/amber effect (to drive with a sledge hammer the notion that we're seeing a scene taking place in the old-timey 1930's, or are having to look at a digital sunrise/sunset/maudlin digitized death scene), or appears to have been washed in blue ink for an equally irritating, cold and grim effect?I hate, hate, hate this version of King Kong. Fay Wray, by all accounts a brilliant mind, confirmed her intellect when she personally declined Jackson's offer to appear in this project."	1.0	Soon every movie in the world will look like a video game, and no one will care	2006-04-03	28	15	13

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	Man, lotsa people are taking this movie way to seriously, particularly those who don't like it.  Frankly, I don't know what most of the negative reviewers were doing in the theater in the first place.  It's a big, stupid, over the top action-adventure movie that 3 hours long.  If that doesn't sound appealing to you, stay away.  Of course, I'm not typically that big on this kinda thing either.  I'm not really opposed to it in theory, but this kinda ultra-populist stuff is almost guaranteed to be to gutless and middle of the road.  Fortunately, Peter Jackson is no Michael Bay, and while I'm not as big on his stuff as many others, he definitely has a grasp on this sorta material.  Of course, this doesn't totally compare to the LOTR movies, as those were quite a bit more serious, but his ability to work with grand action scenes remains here.  And frankly, it seems like I shouldn't like this movie as much as I do, as it does have a number of problems.  But, what can I say, I had a helluva good time.Many, many people have complained that this movie is too long.  I disagree.  I mean, geez, it's an epic.  It's supposed to feel big and the length fits the general tone and mood of the film.  The increase in length is largely just a sorta ballooning of the elements that were already in the original.  The one major exception is the addition of the bizarre romantic relationship between Kong and Ann.  I think this works a lot better than I would've anticipated, but that no great feat as I anticipated that it wouldn't work at all.  I think it's interesting that this romantic subplot seems far more tailored for male tastes than female.  After all, it is the story of the big, stupid, ugly filthy man-beast that earns the love of beautiful woman for no apparent reason, other than, perhaps, the sheer fact that he really, really likes her.  That and I gotta wonder how many women are really wishing that King Kong will come take them away.  Still, though this stuff works alright, it's too drawn out.  To be blunt, these scenes take up a lot of screen time, and there just isn't a whole helluva that can happen in them, what with Kong being unable to talk and all.  So it largely comes down to alternating close-ups.  Man, you wouldn't believe how much time is spent with the camera pointing at Watts while she is looking at Kong in an affectionate manner.  Personally, I wouldn't have thought that a film could spend too much time staring at Naomi Watts in closeup, but there ya have it.The film does have a fairly lengthy opening section, but I was always passably amused.  It spends most of this time introducing us to a lot a deliberately cliched characters and a sorta intentionally dated either excessively whimsical or ominous tone.  I certainly can understand why some people would be bored with this portion of the film.  In fact, it's seems like I should've been, but I wasn't, so whatever.  But seriously, people need to get over this.  The movie has got like 2 hours of action in it, so the longer wait has got a longer payoff.Once they actually get to Skull Island we are fairly quickly treated to some more or less endless action scenes, and they are generally quite spectacular.  The one exception is the big, silly dinosaur stampede, which is just too wackily improbable, and just doesn't look very good.  It is kinda amusing in it's stupidity, but that ain't worth too much  Many have complained about the frightening, demonic natives, but I think they work very well and are, well, frightening and demonic.  Accusations of racism are stupid-- These people aren't related to anyone in the real world, what with their not being any Skull Island.  And frankly, I think you'd be pretty crazy and upset if you lived on an island filled with monsters, regardless of your race. But, on the other hand, maybe the critics are right.  Maybe they  shoulda had the nutty natives be a bunch've white men in business suit.  Thatta really made ya think.After Skull Island things are perhaps drawn out a little too much.  We don't really learn anything new in the delay between the major action scenes, and it would flow better if Jackson had tightened things up a bit.  Still, once Kong gets back to smashing stuff it's pretty sweet.  The finale is also pretty well done, though I think it's a bit excessively operatic.  Again, this goes back to the whole overly drawn out Kong-Ann angle, and we can only stand to see Ann being sad that Kong is going to die for so long before it gets a little tiresome.The acting is generally pretty stylized, so it isn't really good by modern standards, but it does fit the mood of the film.  Many have complained about Jack Black's performance, and while I hate Jack Black I think he's getting a bit too bad of a rap here.  Yes, he can't really handle the more dramatic scenes so well, and I definitely wearied of looking at his fat face, but he's fine in the lighter parts of his performance. (Which, of course, makes up the vast majority of his role.)  Watts is good enough as Ann, making her affection for Kong more plausible than one might've anticipated.  Brody is a little dull as Jack, but he doesn't have much of a role, frankly.  No one else stands out too much other than Thomas Kretschmann as the ultra surly, eastern european boat captain with a heart of gold.  What can I say, I like that guy.I guess that's it.  This is a just a big, fun, silly movie, albeit with some heart.  About as good as this kinda thing gets.  File alongside `The Mummy' and `Pirates of the Caribbean'.Grade: B+/A- Can't decide	5.0	4.5.

I have all of the various versions that have been made of the King Kong story and this by far is the best.  Naomi Watts is mesmerizing as she transforms from a simple vaudvillian actress to the stronger minded woman, determined to outwit and escape from the beast, only to realize in the end that she alone could provide the release that the ape needs as he is tormented and killed by people who have no understanding of his plight.	5.0	King Kong	2013-05-09	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3BWP965RIWBCU	"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker"""	"Reviews of ""King Kong"", the technically, visually, and dramatically stunning 2005 remake of this now classic cinematic tale, are legion on the Amazon's North American WWW sites. Many critics have ""panned"" the film; perhaps they hate the ""monster movie"" genre (to which ""King Kong"" certainly belongs) so much that such a prejudice blinds them to this particular film's fine qualities. I saw the movie with a friend whose knowledge of motion picture lore dwarfs my own, and who screened this film (from the DVD ""Deluxe Extended Edition"" on three discs) after having shown me (along with some other friends) the original R.K.O. ""King Kong"" of 1933, with the extra features on the DVD, as well as the interesting 1976 remake, and only then this even more compelling 2005 version of the tale (with its DVD bonus extras), as well. As for that 1976 remake, by the way, it is a lot better, despite the highjinx and compromises of its production and original publicity, somehow adding up to more than its constituent parts, than all the catty remarks that have been made about it assess it to be! Regarding the 1933 ""King Kong"", I know rather well a family member of the R.K.O. proprietors' descendents, who lives quite comfortably off the fortune which the royalties of the 1933 film and other R.K.O. movies still generate, so the ""inside information"" which he conveyed to me regarding the R.K.O. studio's inner workings had increased considerably my curiosity about ""King Kong"". The sheer lore of ""King Kong"" on screen in its three full length motion picture versions fascinates but also certainly intimidates a writer to review any or all of these movies; I only am making a short and feeble attempt at the nagging urges and challenge of the good friend who showed me the three films. I'll limit my comments to some of my personal impressions of the three versions.The 1933 motion picture stands up well to the comparisons. The R.K.O. production was of path-breaking importance to the history of cinema in many ways; the bold technical advances made in its filming, which impacted the motion picture industry so strongly, are utterly fascinating, and I would suspect that the 2005 movie, in its turn, already has furthered the art of film-making to at least some extent, even if not so crucially as the 1933 movie had done so. What interests me most, though, after having viewed the 1933, the 1976, and the 2005 films, is the characterisation of the actors in the principal roles (which differ somewhat in the naming, and even career types, of the personages), each ""take"" on the characters of this epic story having its own kind of validity.The eponymous mega-ape itself, of course, entails a sophisticated resort to cinematic artifice to bring this character to screen. The 1933 film did this with a degree of sophistication that still commands respect, even compared to the 1976 mechanical ape. What sets off the 2005 achievement is how life-like the monster's facial expressions are and how the beast's muscular movements, even those of its hind-quarters, co-ordinate to convey how utterly simian King Kong is made to behave. The animation of the other prehistoric creatures of Skull Island does not match the detail of King Kong in any of the three films, but even the 1933 movie's screen beasts, all of them, surpass what one sees in such creatures in most films of the genre from as late as the 1950s or even the early 1960s. As for Kong's dizzying ascent of New York City's skyscrapers in the final confrontation of the mega-ape with ground and, especially, air forces in the film's climax on its then tallest of them, as giddy as all of these films make one feel atop the Empire State Building, it is this scene in the 2005 version that left me with the most thoroughly churned stomach and frightened feelings of vertigo.My favourite character among the men of each movie's cast is the male romantic lead, Jack (or John) Prescott, who in 1933 is a virile but winsomely bashful senior member (Bruce Cabot) of the crew of the ship and and of its Skull Island expeditionary force, in 1976 a shaggy-headed, ruggedly but leanly handsome sort of ""green"" ecology activist and primate anthropologist (Jeff Bridges), and in 2005 a slim but lithe, reticently mannered, but romantically ardent writer of theatrical and screen plays (Adrien Brody). Bruce Cabot's impersonation is rather of the stolid and thoroughly sailor-like kind, as the script of the 1933 film requires, but he is believable and he does grow as a character when his love for Ann, his (and King Kong's) sweetheart, develops. Jeff Bridges is irresistibly physical and hiply handsome, quite up to any challenge that the human savages, the savage jungle, or the even more savage creatures therein, and New York City in chaos, all pose; his love for the female romantic lead is the most strongly and hormonally sexual in nature of any of the three films' male lead. For me, however, Adrien Brody's exquisite Jack is the most nicely detailed in portrayal, gently rakish, sensitive, and quite visibly head-over-heels in love with Ann right from the moment when he first encounters her. Brody succeeds in rising to the challenge of Jack's ordeals in the jungle and then in mayhem-beset New York City in a way that overcomes, convincingly, what one would expect of the slender, fit, but muscularly only modestly developped wordsmith as Brody embodies him.Of the other male characters, the most endearing is Jimmy (Jamie Bell), the only partly reformed adolescent delinquent who is given another chance in setting his life on a positive course as the most junior member of the ship's crew and who proves his pluck ashore in the jungles of Skull Island; his part has no equivalent in the 1976 film, and so little in the 1933 movie that the character of Jimmy barely registers on the viewer's attention in that original version.  One of the low-key but most strikingly spooky moments in the film occurs when Jimmy explains to Jack (with an objectivity that is all the more dreadful for its calm) just how a victim's body really reacts when stabbed, whether fatally or otherwise.  A chill runs not only visibly through Jack but also through the viewer; this kid knows all about mayhem and murder from his own blade-wielding experience! Providing for me the single greatest urge to buy the DVD in this packaging, as a big fan of all things terpsichorean, is Jamie Bell's work in Jimmy's shipboard dance with Ann, youthfully vigourous and spryly fleet-footed, as glimpsed only briefly in the film as released, but which had been given in full as the scene was filmed so memorably during production, and included among the Extended 3-discs set's extra features (but not even in the Extended Version itself of the film). (Jamie Bell's considerable dancing talents had been in high profile in his first film, ""Billy Elliot"", in which Bell played the title role.) This dance number reminds me of the kind of salty antics of the traditional seafaring dancing (without female partner, of course, hence often danced solo), which even then was becoming rare among sailors, that I was lucky enough to observe aboard ship (only far better done in the movie!) when I was in the Navy during the Kennedy years (early 1960s).The other male characters are of somewhat less interest to me (though surely not so to other viewers), although, among them, Robert Armstrong's irrepressibly mountebank Carl Denham of 1933 is the unsurpassed characterisation of his role. Compared to that actor, even Jack Black's amusingly Elton John like impersonation of Carl Denham in 2005, and certainly Charles Grodin as the crassly venture business entrepreneur Fred Wilson, the more-or-less equivalent character in the 1976 version, both pale by comparison to Armstrong's 1933 exuberant show-biz and adventure crazed portrayal of Denham.Fay Wray as Ann Darrow in 1933 remains the most pschychologically convincing realisation of the role, waiflike but very pretty and perhaps the most consistently wary of Kong's fierceness. Jessica Lange (the equivalent, named Dwan, of Ann in the other versions) in 1976 is the most divergent in personality, so daffily and modishly ""airheaded"" during the voyage to Skull Island, but adapting to things adroitly once she finds herself in the jungle. Lange's Ann certainly is the most erotically attuned to Kong; her scene settling in to lounge in King Kong's ""Easy Boy"" armchair-like palm is the most visually striking moment for that gal in any of the three versions! It is Naomi Watts, playing Ann Darrow in 2005, who is the most alert to the sympathetically titanic-but-tender aspects of Kong's nature. All three actresses are of the same basic physical type, slenderly pretty but not big-bustedly bodacious as so many screen beauties have been. Kong gets to divest Fay Wray (with more sizzling effectiveness) and Jessica Lange of some of their clothes, but Kong displays less sexual curiousity about the Ann Darrow of Naomi Watts, the body of which actress, however, many human guys gladly would investigate very eagerly.All three versions of ""King Kong"" are worthy of this tale's primal (and primate) appeal, even if it is the 1933 and 2005 movies' spectacular effects, respectively for early sound film and for later cinematography, which most immediately draw the attention of mass audiences to them. I found the storm scene in the 2005 film very gripping, and realistic, too (and this comment comes from a former sailor who, indeed, was in such storms at sea) when the rusty old scow of a ship copes successfully with the heaving ocean waters as the captain and crew struggle to keep the ship afloat while navigating it free of Skull Island's jagged contours.All three films, the 1976 version included, well merit time spent watching them, as do the fascinating extra features that add so much to the value of the DVD issues of the 1933 and 2005 movies."	5.0	King Kong, Early (1933) and Later (1976 and 2005), Always Vastly Entertaining to See and Fascinating to Compare!	2009-11-15	3	2	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A15Q9YEG1XPEJN	Get What We Give	"At first I wondered, ""Why remake King Kong again?"" It's been done several times and never very well (did you see the stinker version with Jessica Lange?). Even though the original 1931 version used stop animation filming for Kong and was in black and white and had cinema's early sound, it is still unquestionably the benchmark version. Even Jackson concedes that. Jackson is humble enough to not have wanted to surpass the original, but rather put forth his own version and have it be judged on its own merits.I didn't want to like this film. I really didn't. But I do. It's awesome!Jackson and his talented actors and crew have created a masterpiece of a film that fully engages the viewer. Even though you know what is going to happen if you've ever seen the original, you will be on pins and needles during some of the action sequences.So realistic is Kong that you fully expect him to really exist. I understand that Andy Serkis ""played"" Kong and the gorilla was then animated based on Serkis' movements. Brilliant, simply brilliant!Naomi Watts is simply marvelous in her Fay Wray role. She brings life and innocence to what could have been an unforgiving role opposite Kong's upstaging. And yet, their scenes together are some of the most brilliant in the film as she and Kong truly seem to connect. My hat is off to Watts (and Serkis if he was participating during the shooting of the scenes together) and Jackson for this ability.There's no need to rehash the storyline - we all know it.The cast of actors are all memorable and well cast. I particularly liked Jamie Bell's portrayal of a stowaway-cum-deck hand role and Jack Black (whom I don't usually like) as a scoundrel of a film producer/director.There are two action sequences during which I was literally holding my breath. One features Kong, Watts, and three huge Allosaurs. Another features the crew of the ship and hundreds of giant size creepy crawlies (if you are bothered by bugs, you'll go insane during this scene).This is good stuff folks.

His efforts were lavished with good box office, plenty of recognition, awards along with critical acclaim and a blank check from the studios on what he wanted to do next.Can't blame the guy for wanting to wallow in a little self-indulgence, but to take moviegoers still high on his LOTR experience along for the ride was...well, a bit much.Jackson's ""King Kong"" could be a really decent 2 hour popcorn flick trapped in 3 hours plus of pretension, ill-advised casting, lazy writing, half-baked effects, overwrought action sequences and an extremely uneven tone.  Is it a adventure-drama? Is it a matinee schlock-fest? Is it ""Titanic"" with fur? Who knows...it is definately TOO LONG and too disjointed to tell. Jackson needs to remember what EDITING is and realize not every story has to take a ""week"" to tell. His theatrical, far-superior edits of the LOTR movies prove he can do this...there were times while sitting through ""Kong"" I groped for the remote...thinking I was at home watching the super-extended, scrapings-off-the-cutting-room-floor DVD version instead of the theatrical release...jeez, one can only imagine how long that extended version's gonna be...and you know it's coming! Storylines that are start and end with no resolution and characters have motivations that suck the life out of what was a simple adventure with a terrifying protagonist..instead of the kinder, gentler beast we get here. The oddest choice is having Denham(the completely awful Jack Black) utter the last classic line (as the character did in the original)  after Jackson has spent 3 plus hours transforming this character into a remorseless, greedy SOB...huh? The only performer who comes off unscathed by the whole affair is Naomi Watts...she gamely gives it her all and her scenes with Kong are what make this long affair watchable.I'm still agog that so many mainstream critics jumped on the high-praise bandwagon for this dud...Save your money folks...this beastly turkey will be beat to death on basic cable soon enough (although with commercials it'll take a week to air) and hope that Jackson has this out of his system enough to tackle something fresh and original with his talent."	1.0	Not worth the hype...	2006-02-27	38	17	21

The actor who played the captain was excellent. I also thought the visuals of the biplanes at the end were extraordinary, but I'd turn the air blue if I described what I thought about the rest of the movie. WAY off target, not worth viewing, honestly, and I expected a terrific movie.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	Like many viewers who tire easily of the 'big whammies' that get all the media blitz, this reviewer waited to see KING KONG until the glut of audience overflow in the theaters gave way to private home DVD watching.  And then the main reason for watching it was the impressive list of good reviews here on Amazon.com and from some fellow reviewers.  Much to my surprise for a person (read curmudgeon) who doesn't usually go for sci-fi super hero action movies, I quite liked this film.  It is grossly in need of editing its 3 hour plus time frame, but the remake of the old movie is a good story well told with some fine actors making it all a joy to see.One reason for the success of this version was director Peter Jackson's decision to keep it in the 1930s in the same time frame of the original.  The recreation of the Depression is quite effective and energizes the need to believe in this fantasy film. Naomi Watts yet again proves that even in roles opposite a computer generated Kong she can still creates illusions as an actress far better than most.  She is a fine heroine for the story.  But the choices of using Jack Black as the movie producer and Adrien Brody as the writer were VERY strong decisions.  For those who equate Jack Black with potty mouth dumb movies his performance will surprise in its sensitivity.  And then adding such fine actors as Thomas Kretschmann, Jamie Bell, Kyle Chandler, Evan Parke, John Sumner etc offers substance to the film.Though the special effects are excellent, the middle third of the film once the crew is on Skull Island and we are endlessly confronted with hungry dinosaurs is soooooooo long that it becomes tempting to stop watching the film.  But finally we realize the purpose was giving time for Watts to create a credible relationship with Kong and all is forgiven.The tenderness of the story makes it work and there is a lot to be said about understanding, caring, relating, greed, and animal brutality that make this film ring true.  KING KONG is simply so much better than expected that despite is excesses it still is a very good movie for all that!  Grady Harp, April 06	4.0	A Surprisingly Good Movie!	2006-04-02	7	6	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A26TY6GCGBF5HT	Graves	"""I was ready for the film to be over long before the monkey hit the pavement"" With these words Laurel K Hamilton's character Anita Blake wonderfully summed up Peter Jackson's well intentioned, brilliantly re-envisioned but ultimately needless remake of King Kong.Jackson's `Kong is more realistic using CGI in place of a rabbit fur covered stop motion animation, his natives seem more real than the dreadfully racist portrayal in the original but it is the actors that make the story work. In place of the wooden, 2 dimensional characters of the original piece Jackson presents well developed people you want to learn about. Adrian Brody as a shanghaied screen writer proves his ability with only a few words and gestures as he tries to find something good in what is clearly a bad situation.Especially surprising is Jack Black in a serious role, as Carl Denham, the man responsible for the expedition. In the original he is the money and the vision and little more. In Jackson's version he's only a step ahead of creditors and keeping many balls in the air while trying to get the next big score. He's a con man and an artist and someone who's company you'll love, as long as you accept you're paying for the drinks.In his Lord of the Rings trilogy Jackson proved that great film comes from the actors and the F/X are there to support them. However far too much of King Kong is made up of the special effects and while amazing to see, they bring nothing new to the party and the reliance on them gets boring. Giant nasty lizards? All I could think was ""Jurassic Park"" and it took too long. Who cares about CGI monsters? Give us back those wonderful characters! For me the movie dragged when they entered the island until the moment they left it.While the chase through New York City is far more realistic, one of the great scenes in American Film is the original Kong on top of the Empire State Building. Jackson's Kong ends there too but the image, far more realistic looking, lacks the iconic imagery of the original.In the end Jackson's respect for the original leads him to end with the same words from Denham. In the original he's a stuffed shirt who's closing declaration ""T'was beauty killed the beast"" is meant as a sad commentary on the beast, brought out of the heart of darkness to a far more terrible place that they all had a hand in. Jack Black's Denham almost whispers the words. For him it is a personal realization that he personally was responsible for the pain and suffering inflicted on the great being. One cannot help but wonder if Jackson, when all is said and done, could not have felt the same way about what he did."	3.0	great actors, pointless film	2009-10-02	4	3	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AARTFDXI65XKZ	Green Star	"""That's the thing you come to learn about Carl. His unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves.""The same is true about directors who remake their favorite films. Once the mystery is gone and the essence has been altered to suit their needs, there's nothing left of the legend. That's the case with Peter Jackson's big-budgeted, over-hyped, over-long remake of the 1933 immortal classic ""King Kong"". Too much is revealed, too much has been altered. What was once a brief, frightening excursion into the realm of horror has become a sentimentalized pretension; a lofty fantasy that cannot possibly hope to live up to its namesake. As is the case with many of todays remakes, if this film had been a separate entity, it would have worked extraordinarily well. Take away the fumbled, boring ending in New York and focus the entire feature on the island and its many wonderous inhabitants. Find a message about leaving the last remaining untouched mysteries of the world alone and convert this from a tiresome remake into a new work of art. What saddens me is that this mess came from a director whose legend precedes him. The epic scope of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was breathtaking and inspired awe. The epic scope of ""King Kong"" left me yawning and looking at my watch. That's the way it is for those of us ""pre-millenium"" horror enthusiasts. Nowadays, if you don't have outrageous special effects and innumerable plot points per film, the audience won't pay attention. These ""post-millenium"" movie goers have been tarnished by the simple fact that they don't have to rely on their imaginations anymore to have a good time. Everything is laid out for them from point A to point B. There's no thought behind it anymore. No beauty. No truth. Certainly no art.

And the scenes when kong is fighting the t-rex, although cenematic and entertaining, are around 30 miniutes long. The movie also features some very impossible things, aside from the obvious (cough, giant ape, jack black trying to act dramatic). Like the scene where kong first takes Ann. Kong is running through the forest at top speed swinging ann in is arm as if he were trying to give her whiplash, and that of course is what any human being would get. A very old car being flipped and tossed up to fifty feet in the air and falling back down to earth becomeing totaled and three feet shorter than it was before the incident and the passenger walks out with no broken bones but only a mere stratch or two. Dispite this it was a pretty good movie. I would reccommend this but would rather watch the lord of the rings myself. The cgi was brilliant, as the acting was to. I mean the way the natives of the island were, amazing, kind of creepy. Over all i'd reccommend for someone who is willing.	4.0	Great film, but long film.	2006-11-01	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1TVW07716XBHQ	"Gustav ""gus"""	I thought it was gonna be a very much more interesting movie. The Plot It's Ok in general, just Ok. Don't get me wrong, there are many parts as intense as the movie really deserves it, but please dinosours??? Giant insects? Smart Insects? Giant Bats? Big Iguanas? But the worst of all, is to see Naomi Watts dancing as a fool in order to get rid of KK. Not to say that watching KK lought at her did not made me lough at all.The effects are great, what ever... but I can see why it has no Oscar in hands, just as Peter got for TLOTR.It has to much o many things that do not belong there.In general it's just entertaining, but it does not do more than that. It was a just one time to see movie.I do not pretend to have reality, I undestand it's fantasy, but come one... PJ just went off the normal.The rest it's just what made theother KK movies cruel...But asa movie, it's just better than the other because it's newer, more modern... that's all.It's your choise.	2.0	JUST A REVIVAL	2006-03-31	7	0	7
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ANIMV3SPDD8SH	Guy De Federicis	King Kong is sitting on a cliff, staring out at the sea of humanity, the sunset glistening in his thoughful stare, looking as much a troubled soul as Ghandi contemplating humankind, while his tiny Fay Wray joins him at his side, in what seems a philosophical prayer to all of civilization. It is, at once, both a ridiculous scene and a touching one, a humanizing of the movie's greatest monster that's as homey as Andy Griffith casting a parental gaze over Mayberry while patting Opie on the head.What is missing in Kong's frantic confrontation with man on the streets of New York City, and what made the original 1933 film so horrific, is the panicked animal quality revealed in the eyes of the original Kong, as he searched high and low on the streets of the big city for anything resembling a jungle vine. He was the pet monkey gone violently berserk in a worst case scenario. Here, he's barely more frightening than the average New Yorker late for the subway.So we have a kinder, gentler Kong. The scares are reserved for the striking island scenes during the first half, that serve as a techno-wonder salutation to the fine work of the original film, and arrive, thankfully, after the melodramatic trite, cliched characters, and stale performances of the film's first 40 minutes.But I enjoyed the film as an entertaining tongue-in-cheek homage to early Hollywood and the original monster. The special effects and cinema work are a feast for the eyes. What this docile magilla-gorilla needs is a bad case of rabies.	4.0	THE NEW KING KONG	2006-09-15	6	1	5

Horror fans would love the sceeens in the cavern of the insects. For me, a fan of loving relationships, the relationship between Ann and Kong was beautiful to watch, especialy the sceen in central park in New York city with Kong playing on the ice. So I'd give most of the the film a half hearted three but the love between the two of them a five. As my title says, for me at least, there was only about twenty minutes of the film worth watching.	4.0	About 20 minutes was worth watching	2006-05-03	8	1	7

First of all, I'm in totally agony, I have appendicitis. I have a dull pain near my navel area and it becomes sharp as I touch my lower right abdomen. I have a loss of appetite (yes, I couldn't even have buttered popcorn because of my appendicitis) and I'm cramping like crazy. But what better, than to try and get my mind off it by watching a great movie. So I get there 45 minutes early so I can get a great seat. Then these middle aged couple strolls in and sits right behind me. At first they were commenting about how his mother is getting so old and what old folks home they should put the guy's mother in but no, they couldn't continue talking about that. No, they had to then talk about the whole plot of the film. ""Hey Barbara (girlfriend), I can't wait to see the part where King Kong falls off the Empire State Building and dies."" I just sat there, dumbfounded. The guy just ruined the whole movie for me. I'm thinking, the film's completely lost its luster for me.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A185EESOBNYD43	Happy	I have never felt strongly enough about a movie to force me to type a review but everyone else seems to be afraid to say what needs to be said about this one.  First off lets forget about this Peter Jackson made LOTR so now I have to bow to him as my new god crap that everyone is doing.First off in all seriousness this movie is too long.  By the end of the movie all I could think about was getting up and leaving.  I'm not saying it's bad because it's long though.  I'm saying it's bad because nothing happens that is important very offten.  Some movies need to be very long but this one does not.  Your sitting there an hour before you even get to see King Kong.The next big flaw in the movie are the characters.  We spend an hour before they get to the island and yet we still don't care about them.  Even Kong had this problem.  In the past at least you felt bad for the thing but now he is nothing more than a spoiled brat.  Then theres the people we don't know whose sole purpose is to die because we can't kill anyone if theres a chance someone might remember there name when the movie is over.  Even Ann who should have died just from being held in Kong's hand as he runs.  The human body can only be shaken so much.  But she comes out of it without the slightest of bruse good for her.In the whole three hours there was only few good parts.  When Kong fought the V-rex I was ammused for a few seconds.  Just all in all the movie was trying to hard to live up to the hype.  Just because Peter Jackson made it doesn't make it an epic to define the ages.  I think I'll go watch Godzilla trash New York.  At least that was entertaining.	1.0	Looking to WASTE 3 hours?	2005-12-16	24	9	15
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A18MBO1U4DPY20	Harkanwar Anand	Of course, King Kong is gonna do great business around the world and attract audiences from all over the world and be a big bang. It's worth the money especially since it's a 3hour7minute film full of dinosaurs,large insects,bats,giant birds and of course our beloved King Kong.The action blows away most of what you might have seen for a long time and competition can lay off but it is truly the storyline and the casting that fails to make this a complete epic or an erstwhile great flick. There are a lot of loopholes in this entertainer and no, I'm not the kind of person who wants things to be explained to him but it's just the way in which the story unfolds that leaves a lot to be desired. Around 20 minutes into the film, one is left wondering where's the director gonna take the film from here.Like Lord Of The Rings, this film takes it times to create the effect of a time distant from today and there are a few scenes where the cinematography is quite good.However, there were many times in the film I felt that the story needed a push and better editing because it induces sleep. There's a good one hour before Kong shows us his teeth, his questionable transfer from Skull Island to America, Adrien Brody's shabby lovers miscast, the absence of blood on actors when obviously expected (probably to win a U certificate) were soem things that I could not turn a blind eye too.Naomi Watts does an OK job though she doesnt really sizzle in anyway. King Kong is just right for his size until the time he starts swinging on rocks and hanging from cliffs. The much exaggerated love affair between Watts and Brody is irritating especially when Kong falls of Empire State Building. Some of the best scenes in the film were the ones with Kong and Watts alone (ice,building,dance,etc)There was not one scene in this film that made me go WHOA! with the earnestness of a movie lover that I am. There were atleast 2-3 scenes in all of the LOTR Trilogy that did the same for me. I was very enthusiastic about this film but it failed due to a mammoth random sampling of individuals and sequences in not the most perfect way. It is impossible for King Kong to have been perfect but it's the magic of film making that truly brings the best out of mankind and I expect Peter Jackson to capture that essence.A very staunch effort,glorious budget,enthusiastic script yet a very disappointed Kong Lover,that's me..PS- Of course I will watch this film atleast two times more. However, I'm gonna have to wait for HBO to obtain the rights cause I'm gonna spend many Saturdays sitting on my couch enjoying Kong's roars yet recalling...	3.0	Miscasting Jack Black in a relentless graphical epic	2005-12-21	8	3	5
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1H8JUI9GNQKNR	Harold Harefoot	"This has to be one of the saddest movies I've ever seen - and I mean that in a good way.  As I said in the title section, there were a few moments when I just couldn't get into it.  Not to give anything important away, but one was when one crew member was firing wildly with a sub-machine gun, shooting bugs off of another guy without ever hitting the other guy with a single bullet.  Fortunately, things like that were few and far between.  Naomi Watts was amazing as Ann Darrow, the leading lady (how she didn't get an Oscar for this performance is beyond me).  And the animators who brought Kong to life...  They turned him into the perfect leading ""man"".  In fact, Watts and Kong (even though he wasn't even actually there when Watts was acting) had more on-screen chemistry than I've seen from most real human pairings in the majority of today's romantic comedies.  Additionally, while many people have disparaged Jack Black's performance as Carl Denman, I thought he was spot on as the smarmy self-promoter the entire movie.  He consistently lied to everybody throughout the entire story, including the very last line of the movie which, while meant to sound profound, just covered for the fact that it was his greed, not beauty, that had done the evil deed.  I didn't think the length of the film was excessive.  I was captivated by it almost all the way through.  They probably could have shortened it by a few minutes by getting rid of some of the more ridiculous things like that bug scene in the swamp area I mentioned above, but it still would have been nearly three hours long and well worth watching the whole way through."	5.0	A few, brief hokey moments, but otherwise, Wow!	2006-04-16	8	4	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3T8D2ZBYHHI3M	Harold Hungerford	I expected a bit more of a logical film even though the basic premises are a bit crazy.  Yet, I wanted to see it so I ordered it.  The cast was a mixed bag with some wonderful artists present in it.  The members of the group, by and large, seem to survive some falls, etc that would certainly do most of us a ticket to the Great Movies in the Sky.  It is just a matter of my mixed expectations that did me in a bit and, yes, I am old enough to remember the original.  Maybe that's the problem.  And, the events seemed to be staged too long.  This made for a movie that did not need to be this long.  Still, for absolute well filmed craziness, I do recommend it with a few reservations.	4.0	King Kong a Bit of a Disappointment	2013-08-24	1	1	0

I have seen it in Theaters twice when it came out so I was very happy when the DVD came out. The special effects are the best I have seen, I mean come on just look at it, and for all that might not know CG Effects like the ones they did for the film it is very hard to make it look great in daylight and in the film lots of effects are in daylight and they just looked great.  The rest of the extra stuff on the DVD is great! And will keep you interested for a long time, so if you don't have the DVD go and get it, the movie is for all ages and it will keep you glued to your TV set for a long time. Other things you should look out for that is coming out on DVD and Cd is The Vines- Vision Valley 4-4-06, Tool- 10,000 days 5-2-06 and for DVD Brokeback Mountain 4-4-06 and also Check out V for Vendetta in theaters now, that was an amazing movie!	5.0	Great Movie, Made for theathers but still amazing on DVD!	2006-03-29	1	0	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AX2OOUX8KAGUP	Hendrix Forever	"I haven't seen a movie this good in a very long time.  I wasn't very sure if I would like it or not, due to the massive amounts of CGI effects and all, but then I remembered that Peter Jackson was directing it.  Peter Jackson is my favorite director, mainly because of his earliest movies...splatter flicks with jaw-dropping amounts of gore (Dead Alive, Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, etc...). So me and my best friend went to see King Kong, and I have to say that I was amazed.  All the CGI was so convincing. You really couldn't tell what was fake and what wasn't.The near two hours they spent on Skull Island was my favorite part.  The scenery was so beautiful, yet it was very unsettling. When we first see Skull Island, we are greeted by a large group of cannibalistic natives, which are actually pretty scary to say the least. If you've seen the original 1933 version, then I shouldn't need to explain the rest to you. But let me tell you, Peter Jackson made it much, much better by adding on to the original story. The high points in the film are as follows:-When Kong fights the gang of T-Rex's, it's unbelievable to say the least.-The brontosaurus stampede was amazing and it made me want to jump up and scream. It was a very claustrophobic moment in  the film.-When they are down in the pit with all of those mutated looking centipedes and huge grasshopper looking insects, it's VERY unsettling and highly entertaining at the same time. I was laughing at them when the bugs kept crawling up on them and they would say ""Get it off!"" It was great.-And of course, the legendary scene where Kong carries the woman up the Empire State Building.  At the end of this scene, lots of people in the theatre were crying, and rightfully so.The casting was also great.  Naomi Watts and Jack Black were outstanding.  They did an amazing job with this movie.I hope everyone gets the chance to go see this.  It's a masterpiece.  I can't say that it surpasses the original, but it still must be one of the greatest movies from the past 10 or 20 years.  I hope to see a great collectors edition DVD within the next few months, because I know I will be purchasing it."	5.0	Amazing...	2005-12-18	3	1	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ACO20QL72D1E6	"Henning Sebastian Jahre ""Judy-Viv"""	"What a lovely 90 minute film that lies within these 187 minutes......  To me the 2005 film only works when it sticks close to the original of 1933. The cast is great though, but sadly Kong is just one of many monsters on the island and the most exciting scene is the escape from frightened dinosaurs....  The excape from the insects were cut in 1933 because it took attention from Kong. Why didn`t they learn???In 1976 Kong is a great beast with almost human qualities - sort of a missing link. Here he is back being a gorilla of oversize and it is a puzzle why Ann is not killed by his rough treatment of her early on. The Jimmy-Hayes relationship goes nowhere and they could easily have been omitted.The 1976 film has great locations, while this is a blue-screen effort and u see it much too often. I mean several cliffs and stones in the shape of a gorilla?  It's  enough with Skull island... Ann`s vaudeville tricks and their Bambi-moment in New York is BAAAAAAAAAAD...  The New York sequences should have been better, but the Empire State Buidling-scene survives...The sacrifising of Ann is both good in 33 and 76, here - it's dramatic, but the first sight of Kong is just shadow.......And magical moments are far between because Jackson doesn`t dare to slow down...In the 1976 film we get to love Kong....  Here... well we don`t....  It`s a great actioner, but I wish Jackson could have relaxed a bit.... It's funny the way Denham refers to Fay Wray early on(""but she`s shooting over at RKO"")Many people feel Kong is a racist. But that`s insane... Of course he warms up to a whiteperson - she`s a novelty - a new thing to him..... He is just curious and collects her as a prized possession.But it is an OK contribution to the myth of Kong. It's NOT the best Kong, but it's OK in a trilogy of the giant...."	3.0	What?????	2006-02-16	16	5	11
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2CW5J4VOZY6MN	Henry Lee	"Peter Jackson's ""Kong"" was not just a movie but a thrill ride. A hyper thrill ride that touched me in so many areas. Especially visually. As a artist I almost quit painting after llooking at the astonishing hyper realistic detail in the movie. The texture, color, detail was incredible. The narrative was just as powerful as the visual.Kong's battle with the two T-Rex was the best special effects I have ever seen. The intricate attention to detail as they fell down the cliff was uncanny. I found myself cheering for a alpha male like myself. Kong transcened his beastiality. Any XY chromosome male could identify with his sheer power, masculinity and battle scars..I rooted for Kong as if I had a front row seat at a Mike Tyson fight. I think Kong is one of the most iconic creature in moviedom history.I almost quit painting after gazing at the color, texture, and detail of Jackon's epic movie. The only flaw was the depiction of the natives they came off as caricatures-----without any humanity.The other flaw was in the ship started its epic voyage: the smoke from the steamer does is pasted on the sky-- no movement.In closing Peter Jackson's Kong is a classic why not a sequel or prequel?"	5.0	I questione why I still paint	2013-08-09	1	1	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A457S8SW690NM	hi	First off, I never saw the original. So, I don't know how it is compared to that but it's probably better. After all, it's very hard to be better than this movie. It is the best of the year, and is extremely entertaining even though it's 3hr10min.Already, I had to like this movie because of Naomi Watts, my favorite actress. As for Peter Jackson, in all honesty, I didn't like the Lord of the Rings. This movie blows them away.The ending of the movie at first made me mad but it made the movie very tragic and sad. Yet, I would have preferred a happier ending.The movie is set in the Great Depression with Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) a gorgeous actress put out on the street. A movie producer (Jack Black) offers her the chance of a lifetime to star in his new movie written by her idol, a screewriter played by Adrien Brody. They go onto a huge boat and sail off to film the movie. They land on an island called Skull Island where they have an encounter with bizarre and violent natives. Then they meet the Dinosaurs, the insects and King Kong. The parts on the island are the best, absolutely splendid. The action is nonstop and the special effects are brilliant. The humans struggle to survive and have huge gun fights against dinosaurs and crazy insects. Meanwhile Ann is swooped up by Kong, and they form a bond as he saves her from countless dinosaurs and insects. They are so sweet together and it made me feel like saying a[...] But the best parts are Kong just beating the crap out of the other dinosaurs. The fights are insane and frickin' sweet. But then, Kong is captured and brought back to New York where he is commercialized and peeved off. He escapes and goes off with Ann where their love is shown. But then comes the end, and I was trully very depressed.Kong was AMAZINGLY made and made Aslan look like nothing. His facial expressions at the end made me cry inside as you could see his pain. You knew how he felt at all times. He laughed, cried, and shouted in pain. I became attached to him and the end destroyed me inside. I trully would have preferred a happy ending.The acting is good, but Adrien Brody's nose always got in the way. Jack Black was spledid and Naomi Watts was dazzling. But Kong stole the show by far. He was so real it's scary.The action is UNBELIEVABLE and wonderfully made. Kong basically does WWF wrestling on the other dinosaurs and it is just awesome. Heck, even the humans have tons of guns and have gigantic fights with nasty insects and huge dinosaurs. So the action is some of the best I've ever seen.The movie in the end is a love story on steroids. It's sweet, sad, awesome, etc.. The ice skating part is so sweet!You will get so attaced to the big ape that the end will completely destroy you and beg for a happy one. So trully, I thought the ending was pointless and I would have redone it. The final scene on the Empire State building could have seriously been trimmed down and it made me think: are the plane pilots retarded? They're nearly killing Anne!King Kong is the best movie of the year, a pulse pounding drama that's got it all. It goes back very quickly so don't be worried about the length.The action is AWESOME, the laughs are there and the drama is so very sad. King Kong is the movie I've been wating for..for a very long time. It's a great ride, a sad ride, a must see movie that I will buy on DVD opening day.SEE IT IN THE THEATER!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	This adapted version of the well known towering classic, a pyramidal cult movie of 1933 directed by Merian Cooper, received a distinguished and honest homage by Peter Jackson.Jackson not only produced mesmerizing special effects along the road, but most important still, focuses about the myth and explores through a very zealous dissection, in several levels. The greed, embodied in Carl Dehman - who really beliefs he may exorcize his inner demons under the service of the great audiences by just only $ 0.25 - the force of love, so many times represented in previous stories such as The beauty and the beast, or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, the telluric presence of a wasteland where the triviality and the unlimited hunger of fame will make Kong - The Eighth wonder of the world - and bring it back to our civilized world in order to be admired for the excited crowd, in search of new and challenging emotions.Anne Darrow , the beauty per excellence, knows better than anyone, what's going on behind the apparent aggressiveness of this huge beast, that committed the unforgettable mistake to fall in love with a being of other genre.Two little details tinged this movie: Anne at the moment she gets out, after Kong has escaped from the Hall is the only person in NYC who did not need any coat in the middle of a cold night (the love is hot but not enough to have forgotten this detail), on the other hand when Kong and Anne dance on the lake of ice in Central Park, the edition process was visibly rough, cutting abruptly the most original sequence of the movie.Recommendable entertainment.	4.0	I' m on the top on the world, Ann!	2006-08-25	4	3	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1WYRXUODP1DSG	Honest Reviews	"I really wish I hadn't wasted my time watching this film. The special effects are terribly cheesy, the story is grossly unoriginal, and the film is outrageously drawn out and tedious. If it weren't for the epic finale on top of the empire state building,  complete with guns blazing, a gorgeous multi hued sunset, and the imminent loss of ""true love,"" the film would have been a total loss, entertainment wise.What's really sad is how anachronistic this film is. ""Kong"" is really a metaphor for inter-racial relations, handled in a grossly phantasmagorical way. The threat of a big black beast, threatening a delicate, lily white female may have entranced and fascinated our racially segregated society at one point in time in our culture. But the novelty of this idea is now lost upon us (well, except for our fascination with Kobe Bryant, and  OJ Simpson, and ok, maybe we ARE still fascinated by and fearful of inter-racial relations: woops!). But the notion of ""transplanting"" dark skinned creatures, taming them, exploiting them economically, only to have them turn on us and ""take"" our white women....come one, this really reeks of white male paranoia and privilege. King Kong made sense a long time ago in our society. So why beat a dead horse? We live in a multi-cultural society now.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ACW6JGQNXORRN	HorrorGuy	This review is for the Blu-Ray release. I just finished watching the extended version of this film on Blu-Ray and I thought it was amazing. Universal's transfer of this epic onto Blu-Ray is a show piece for the Blu-Ray format. The picture is crystal clear and vibrant in color. The CGI effects in this film are fantastic. The sound design transferred over to the DTS Master HD codec is among the best on Blu-Ray today. The sound has many sweeping effects that will give your surround sound system a complete workout.Some reviews are critical on Jackson's film because it differs from the original or the performances were not up to snuff etc... Like this version or not as far as story and performances there is no way you can honestly say a negative thing about the look and sound of this film on Blu-Ray; it is nothing short of great. Props to Universal for giving such nice treatment to the Blu-Ray release of this film.	5.0	King Kong on Blu-Ray is Incredible!	2010-01-29	12	10	2

However, the transfer may be a little TOO good, as it shows the inherent flaws in the CG/effects.  For instance, it becomes blatantly obvious during the brontosaurus stampede that everyone was green screened.  There are also many scenes in this transfer where you can see small defects in the CG that weren't caught during the editing process.  Because of the lower bitrate/resolution on the DVD version, these issues are not apparent.	3.0	a little too good	2007-01-11	13	9	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A19JYLHD94K94D	Itamar Katz	With all respect for the talents of Mr. Peter Jackson, clearly the most promising young directors on the rise, I'll be the first to admit that I was among the skeptics who saw no reason whatsoever for the making of this film. King Kong was remade once, please remember, in 1976 by Robert Guillermin, to appalling results. The 1933 original was a perfect film, a classic. Why try to make it again? What purpose could it possibly serve other than being a mild curiosity? Did we learn nothing from Psycho?Having seen it, I'm still not sure there was any real point in remaking King Kong. Peter Jackson's film is no news; it has nothing substantial that the original film didn't, other than a few extra T. Rexes and a couple of very disgusting giant insects. Unlike the 1976 version, Jackson's film doesn't alter any of the characters or plot elements; in fact, it clearly takes place in the 30's, when the original film was made. That's mainly in its favor; still, because of these reasons and more it's clearly a tribute and not an independent film with by its own right.And that's just what makes it so good. Jackson made King Kong with as much love for Merian Cooper as he had for Tolkien when he made Lord of the Rings. Jackson shows real care and respect for the material he works with; more than that he shows care and respect for classic monster films and for cinema in general. King Kong is a joyful celebration of cinema (right down to a wink and nod to the wonderful starlet of the original film, Fay Wray, who was meant to have a cameo in the film but passed away before she could make it). Peter enjoys every second of renewing the beloved film of his youth, and we enjoy it with him. King Kong is a wild ride, a movie made perfectly that never stops entertaining for a minute, and it's the greatest fun you'll know.The cast is for the most part excellent. Naomi Watts does a great job filling in for the late, great Fay Wray, and her Vaudeville scene on Skull Island is outstanding. Best among the cast is Jack Black, a fantastic actor who is yet to reach his peak, who does a fantastic job filling the mighty shoes of Robert Armstrong as Carl Denham. The rest of the cast includes Adrien Brody, Thomas Kretschmann (The Pianist), Kyle Chandler (Early Edition) and Jamie Bell (Billy Elliott). The real star though is Andy Serkis, who apart from doing a swell side-part as trusty sidekick Lumpy, plays Kong himself, to outstanding results. In the same technology used for the creation of Gollum, Andy played out the movements and facial expressions for Kong and these were used for the animated character. Like he did with Gollum, Andy shows remarkable control of his body language, and Kong turns out to be the most impressive and convincing CG character seen on the big screen yet.King Kong is not in any way an essential film, I certainly could have lived without it, but damn, I'm glad it was made, and I'm glad Peter made it! If you love the original and classic cinema in general, it's highly recommended. Even if you don't, it's still guaranteed to be three of the most entertaining hours of your life.	5.0	A wild ride	2005-12-25	3	1	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A27W5AJNP6YX7Z	"Ivy Bewley ""Hiedra"""	"I am usually opposed to making remakes of major classics that are beloved by huge numbers of people. King Kong is really no exception. It might seem like a prime candidate for an update, as you sometimes have to smile at some of their primitive 1933 special effects. But you have to remember that we could never do what we do today if it weren't for their pioneering efforts, and the step-by-step improvements of everyone else along the way. The biggest problem, of course, is that many movie-makers today - those who did this version of King Kong included - overdo it. Back then, you had to be creative to get something you wanted on the screen. Today, all you have to do is type a couple buttons on a computer.One thing that was definitely more REALISTIC in the original King Kong was the WALL. That was definitely BUILT, and by HUMANS! That huge stone wall in the new version... wow. That looked so fake, especially when the camera pulled back and you could see it from way up in the air, lit on fire.I did enjoy this version of King Kong. It kept my attention for the most part, but there were too many times I was just thinking, ""Oh, come on already!"" Kong fights three t-rexes to save the girl. Fine. But after he tosses them over the cliff, did he and the girl really need to fall over the cliff after them??? And then the girl bounces back and forth from t-rex tooth to t-rex tooth until Kong rescues her again. Sigh. The other dinosaur chase that ended with them falling in a pile was so drawn out! (Almost funny, really.) The sea-monsters seemed unnecessary. And the bugs and wormy things! So gross! How did ANY of them get out of that alive? I guess because they kind of just disappeared. And what was up with the car chase at the end???I saw in the special features that even the water they rowed the boat in was CGI. For goodness sake. You will not convince me that rigging up a rocking boat, hanging a green screen, splashing water at the actors, having them put fake pressure on the oars, and animating in water is simpler than putting a boat in water and filming it. After all, they did it 80 years ago. (""But the weather might not be right!!!"") I think it's just an excuse to show off what they can do. This whole movie was an excuse to show off what they could do. Some of it they did well. Most of it looked fine. It was just way too much.Overall, not a bad movie, but not destined to become a classic. In the meantime, if you want to see the original doll used as one of the models for King Kong in the original 1933 movie, check outLucy Mania: The Lucy-Desi Westinghouse Special.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3278XKRKSHWWD	Jacquelyn Thompson	"This is, without a doubt, the silliest movie ever. It's made by Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings fame after all, so we must give him credit and respect for perhaps the longest action sequence ever filmed: about 45 minutes of people fleeing stampeding dinosaurs, getting squashed by thundering feet, falling over cliffs, clutching hanging vines, swinging into dripping jaws, clunking into a valley of mud, getting sucked up by mucky slugs, and fighting off giant spiders, beetles, and mosquitoes. Our heroine, clutched in Kong's palm, is shaken and tossed while he fends dinosaurs, lizards, bats, and plunges over several cliffs. You hear her cry ""ugh, oh,"" and you see her little blonde head bobbing about, but when she finally lands, she still looks pretty and doesn't need a whiplash collar at all. The CG dinosaurs and Kong are amazing: especially when you look at the old King Kong from the 30s with beasts that are so fake you have to laugh. That's all well and good, if action is what you want. But then, in classic Peter Jackson fashion, you have about 30 minutes of slogging melodramatic conclusion. Poor Kong, as we know, gets shot down, when he was after all, despite being very scary-looking, a really sweet guy who happened to fall in love with a human being. (I shouldn't even mention the fact that his member would be longer than she is tall.) Anyhow, we get these endless shots of our girl looking piteously at Kong, and Kong looking sadly at her. Then back to her, and back to Kong. And again. And again. Jackson seems to shout behind the camera: ""Are you crying yet? Not yet? How about some stirring strings to make you weep? How about some more wistful gazes? How about slow motion as Kong plunges toward making his hit on Broadway?"" This is, after all, a fake gorilla. It's touching, but we are not talking about anything remotely ""real"" here. Pumping the audience is just too absurd, and ruins the whole movie. Besides, all those kids who came for the action, are they throwing spitballs at each other by the time this thing finally ends?"	3.0	Great action; silly melodrama	2006-03-31	8	2	6
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	This is a perfect remake. Not one iota of new matter. It is the same as the old film but remade with modern techniques. We delve into a prehistoric world with all the fauna and flora. The fauna is more important though. All the dinosaurs, and giant bugs, and giant worms, and giant bats, etc. Creepy crawling all over the place. We do not see the zipper in the back of the monster and he is lovable, especially his eyes. It is the meeting of the Belle and the Beast who is the Beau of the Belle and he gives way just before she is completely destroyed. The Beast, who is a gallant Beau, is thus undone by the Belle. No anthropology and the natives are just enhancing the pictures, the settings and the environment, a few dancers around the beast on some sound-stage. Yet the film is great because visually it is a treat, a highstyle and highpleasure treat. All the scenes, the creatures, the landscapes, mountainscapes, seascapes, urbanscapes are superb and the droning planes at the end are just as funny, strange and fascinating as the droning giant mosquitoes or wasps in the middle. It is brilliant and the eyes of the Beast are so human that we understand why the Belle fell in love with him, because he becomes a him at that moment, at the moment of his death, a wilfull death. Apart from that don't look for any real deep meaning, not even on the 1930s in the US. The Salvation Army is not the subject of the tale. Just enjoy the luxuriance of the special effects.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne	5.0	Fantastic - Fabulous - Sublime	2005-12-25	4	2	2

How she keeps from breaking her neck, or even getting whiplash, is amazing.  Why can't Kong get around the wall with all of his amazing abilities?  What do the natives do for a living -- that is, when they aren't offering people who drop by as sacrifices to Kong?  Farm?  Do embroidery?  (And the scenes with them doing a sort of drugged dance was really worth a chuckle.)  All that said, it's entertaining.  And most of the unbelievable (in the movie's own world) stuff is in a way fun to see.  So I gave it 3 stars.  It's worth about $5 to see.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1V7O3TXW2FQD5	Jade Sable	King Kong is visually stunning, incredibly heart wrenching and masterfully acted. I had my doubts when I saw Peter Jackson was remaking this movie, since I didn't like the 1930's version with Fay Wray and remakes tend to be huge flops. I thought the 1930 movie unfairly portrayed gorillas as monsters and set a fear against primates the way Jaws did to sharks.With this movie, Peter Jackson breaks down the human/animal barriers by making Kong incredibly human. We see him as more than a giant ape: we see a fierce protector, a loyal friend and an unconditional innocence combined in one. In this version Ann stands up for herself against Kong in the beginning and lets him know she is the alpha female. She entertains him with juggling and he in return shows his appreciation by protecting her against numerous jungle creatures. Their friendship will touch the deepest part of your heartstrings, especially with the scene when they ice skate and King reminds you of a little kid and when they are at the top of the Empire State Building and Kong makes the sign for 'beautiful', which Ann taught him back at Skull Island.Naomi Watts gives an excellent performance as Ann Darrow, the penniless, good hearted actress who catches the eye of desparate filmmaker Carl Denham by refusing to compromise her dignity by working in a burlesque house and almost gets busted for stealing. She reluctantly agrees to be a part of his project when she hears legendary writer Jack Driscoll is also a part of it. Ann and Jack find themselves falling for each other throughout the movie but this romance is sort of a back burner. The main romance is the bond shared by two different people from two different worlds. The universal theme stays the same in this movie: 'Leave animals in their natural habitats!' You'll find yourself shaking your heads in disgust with Carl Denham's greed like I was. The idiots take a wild animal out of his home and want to kill him when he gets spooked and tries to escape! I don't need to elaborate on the ending because we know what happens but I will say this: bring the tissues because the end will have you bawling buckets!This movie was definetly worth the money and I will gladly be plunking my money down for the DVD!	5.0	Another masterpiece by Peter Jackson	2006-08-22	7	4	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A313H6238N589	"Jaewoo Kim ""OB-Wan"""	"These days, it is rare to see the main hero or protagaonist die at the end of the movie. During the Great Depression, when the standard of living was much lower, life much harsher, and death much closer, it wasn't too unusual for the hero to meet his death. Good things, in such times, seems to be ephemeral.If King Kong was made as an original today, surely the heroic gorilla would have continued to live in happiness or at least have his death be meaningful. But King Kong, of course, dies a tragic and misunderstood death.I cried in the last 10 minutes of this film. It is not neccessarily his death that disturbs us; we all know how he would die beforehand. But it is a needless death of a creature of awesome physical prowess and agility with genuine human need for companionship which deeply disturbs us.The 1933 version wasn't as depressing because King Kong was portrayed as a wild brut who happened to have a weird fascination with Anne Darrow. But in this version, King Kong is almost human, and his love for Anne Darrow is not so weird because we understand his strong need for a companion.At the end, one of the characters mention ""it was beauty that killed him"". I disagree, it was man, the most terrifying killer of all, who has a need to kill everything and everyone which is perceived as a threat, that killed King Kong.  This killer instinct and behavior, it seems, is one of the reasons why we are at the top of the evolutionary heirarchy.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2DFNALGGJ6SYQ	"jamco2000 ""seller"""	"I just finished watching the entire 3 disc extended edition with all the extras, including the film with commentary by Peter Jackson and screenwriter Philippa Boyens. I must say it was worthwhile as I am a Kong-a-phile. There are many insights into the making of the film, but what stood out for me in the commentary was the fact that Jackson evidently did NOT have final say in what was to appear on the screen. I was amazed to find him admit that he had to cut out two great dinosaur action sequences on Skull Island to shorten the film. Those two dinosaur scenes (which are included in this edition) amounted to 13 minutes of great action. Peter Jackson was convinced by the screenwriters to ""develop"" the characters to the point where he had to shorten the film time. He gave in and eliminated two action scenes: the ""crossing-the-swamp scene"" and ""the Stegasaurus"" scene. These scenes were, as he explains, an ""homage"" to the original 1933 Kong. Both cut-out scenes used different creatures than the original 1933 version, but he really wanted them in the theatrical version. You'll also see the ONLY ANIMATRONIC dinosaur used in the film. It was cut out of the theatrical version. (a large flightless bird-like creature). The screenwriters and producers pressured him to cut the time down. In my view, cutting out seven minutes on board ship getting to to Skull Island and seven minutes back in New York at Adrien Brody's play and Naomi Watts' floundering dance routine, etc., would have made up for the time needed for the two dinosaur sequences and would have certainly quickened the pace of the original theatrical film.At one point Jackson regrets cutting out so much of the action and says he wants to make it again. My advice: Dump the committee and do the film again. He even suggests, laughingly, that the Venture would have to stop and refuel in South American where Kong escapes, finds a lost world of dinosaurs and gets re-captured before going to New York. You can tell he has his regrets about the final theatrical cut!EXTRAS: The extras in this edition show many deleted scenes on board ship. They are mostly of the crew and computer generated Pre-Visualization, called CG Pre-Viz, for short, which was absolutely necessary to make this film and to make Kong come to life. You'll see a Pre-Viz Kong leaping across New York skyscrapers. One great Pre-Viz sequence is the Bronto stampede. You'll see how it was conceived and made. You'll see Andy Sirkis (who was also Lumpy the Cook) doing Kong body and facial movements, being computer recorded [aka: undergoing motion capture] against blue and green screens and much more. This is how Kong was brought to life, literally. You'll go into the WETA workshop and see the artists and sculptors at work making 3D dinosaurs and Kongs. You'll see how an exact scale model of the Venture was built and used in many of scenes. Also, how a full size 1950's diesel ship was purchased and retro-fitted to look like a 1930's tramp steamship. You'll be amazed to see how the special effects crew got a robot computer program to rebuild 1933 New York City right before your very eyes. It can rebuild, on a computer screen, any street and any building known to exist in 1933 Manhattan. There's a birthday film that the crew did for Peter Jackson; it's somewhat funny. And there are plenty of Kong artwork from the 1996 pre-production film that was never made and artwork from this production put to music that shows, in story-board format, how the director and writers put scenes together. There are full 1996 and 2005 scripts on ROM. A gag reel that isn't that funny. What was most amazing was that just about everything in a scene of the film was CG and believeable."	4.0	Peter Jackson sways to production time limits and studio's & writers' pressure to develop unnecessary characters	2007-02-13	3	3	0

That's why, for me at least, all the fabulous graphics work on Skull Island is largely wasted.  The scenes are vivid, nearly constant, and in one or two cases (think man-eating giant slugs) not at all for the squeamish.  This film earned its PG-13 rating.  Parents of impressionable kids below that age should not bring their children to it unless they are prepared to be sleeping with them at night for a few weeks.But most of all the stay on the island -- and the journey to reach it -- are just plain long.  I want to get back to New York, to hear some dialogue again (don't miss the throwaway homage to the original when Jack Black is searching for his female lead), to revel in the billboard and Broadway recreations, and to see the King and Ann atop the Empire State building as ""beautiful"" dawns over the city and its waters.

STOP comparing this film to Lord of The Rings!!!  I think fans of the LOR series have come to theatres with expectations so high that they are ultimately disapointed.  Look this is a great film, it's everything a movie going experience should be.  You are transported to a different world full of majic and mystery.  It's action, suspence, drama, humor, sci-fi, and a love story all in one.  There are Jaw dropping special effects and beautifull photography.  Some people have complained that some things look fake or there is too much CGI- Um hello it's a movie about a 25 foot gorrilla of course it's fake.  It's like those people who always critisize wrestling saying thats fake, you people just don't get it.  If you just forget about all that and go with it you will have a much better time.  It's about entertainment not realism.  Go to the theatres without any expectations but just with the hope of being entertained for a while and perhaps to escape the reality of your life for a few hours and you will have a good time.Yes I can recognize all the imperfections in the film too but I don't expect it to be perfect in the first place.  We are human, imperfect beings by nature, therefore we can never create something perfect because we have no real concept of perfection, it is something only God can know and Peter Jackson is not God but he has done a pretty good job as a director so stop critisizing sit back and enjoy, if you don't like it go to film school and try your hand at it.My only real critisism is the same one I had for LOR, it's a bit too long.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AGP0LMEHFQITC	"James Lucas Chatfield ""Religion: musician"""	Shave about half an hour off of the hour-and-twenty worth of character development, and this is a solid piece of entertainment.  The leads make the first half of the movie watchable, and once the big man himself gets into the picture (Kong, that is.  Not Jack Black) it's non-stop till the last frame.  The effects are mind-blowing (particularly the brontosaurus stampede), the set-pieces are expertly timed and delivered (the insect pit delivers the kind of full-body-shivers we haven't had since Indiana Jones), and the Empire State Building climax is truly dizzying and spectacular.Mr. Jackson may have gone a little overboard on the Getting-To-Know-You's of this one, but the ultimate payoff is well worth it.PS - heed the PG-13 warning.  Definitely some elements that'll give the young ones nightmares (very big, very realistic bugs--and lots of 'em).	4.0	Almost perfect	2006-03-25	4	3	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A11KRMIA0ES88I	"James Ronald Colyer ""Jim Colyer wrote Save Th..."	Set in the 1930s, Kong again climbs the Empire State Building. Naomi Watts is Ann Darrow. This Kong suffers from an excess of mayhem once the adventurers arrive on Skull Island. The bug scenes are annoying, and it would have been enough for Kong to vanquish two tyrannosaurs instead of three. A consolation is that Naomi does not scream as much as Fay Wray. She develops an affection for the beast. Watts is beautiful and slides into the role naturally. The natives are more sinister than those in the original. The remake is thrilling if you can hang in for 3 hours and 7 minutes.	4.0	King Kong 2005	2008-02-22	1	0	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3PJ3JQYIUXRLU	Jaredbob	From director Peter Jackson(Who also directed the best movies of all time, Lord of the Rings) comes King Kong. Really, I thought this movie would be stupid and i really didn't want to see. But then one day i got dragged into watching it and when it was done I was like, 'man, that was actually good.' The first hour could have add a little time taken off of it but I thought it was fine, because i love long movies. The part when they are on skull island is the best part in my opinion. Jack Black plays the guy with the camara whos leading expedition(forgot his name in the movie) and does a good job with it. I was really surprised when i learned he was in this movie. Andy Serkis also does the motion for king king like he did for Gollum in LOTR. I didn't really recognize any of the other actors in this movie, but that is fine, cause i like having newer guys play in movies. Naomi Watts does well in her role and so does all the others. The ending is very sad but expected, for those of u oddballs who dont know the story of King Kong, i wont ruin it for ya.So make sure to watch this movie even if you think its gonna suck casue it is actually good.	5.0	SOOOOO good...	2006-07-13	5	3	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A4BUK8A2C52VB	"Jason Cook ""Jason M Cook"""	"Okay, I admit it: I'm a little bit of a fanboy.  I think you have to be to some extent, though, when going into a movie knowing it's about a giant ape rampaging through New York.  I walked out of the theatre thinking this is the best movie I've ever seen, probably due to the mass assault on my senses.  I knew that idea would be tempered after reflection, but for reviewers to give this movie 1's & 2's is laughable.  What would they rate the Dungeons and Dragons, You Got Served, Kazaam, Gigli, Spice World or Jaws: the Revenge for crying out loud?Although I don't think any Oscars will be shelled out for the acting in King Kong, I must disagree with those that say the performances were terrible.  I was not a Jack Black fan going into the movie, but I am more so now.  All the other roles were either done well or only suffered from a bit of mis-direction, if you can forgive the play on words.  And I've heard numerous reviewers say how bad the final line of the movie is.  Am I wrong, or isn't the last line taken straight from the original?Speaking of nods to previous versions, I just had to make mention of the native stage scene.  (I haven't seen it previously mentioned, though I haven't read all 700+ reviews on this site either.)  The costumes for the natives on stage in New York looked very much like the true natives' costumes from the 70s version.  Fans of Kong had to chuckle at that.As far as the movie's length goes, I had no problems with it.  When I'm shelling out $9 to see a movie, I'll take three hours over two any day, as long as I'm not bored.  I did not find myself squirming once, unlike Lord of the Rings...and I'm very much a Tolkien fan!  Of course, with three hours to work with, I understand those reviewers asking for a little more character thought into just what is going on there at Skull Island.  On the other hand, they of course would have no idea and didn't seem to have much time to think about it.The brontosaurus (or whatever they are exactly) pile-up, though a great idea, was a little cheesy for my tastes.  As many have already stated, the CGI was a little suspect here and too many people escaped certain death.  That is a problem I have with most action movies these days, though.  The certain death factor can be scaled back a little bit to make it both scary AND believable.  Only one character to my recollection simply found a crevice to hide in until the rolling thunder passed.  Did other reviewers miss the folks that were pulverized into oblivion in that scene, though?  And I understand that there was a need to spur the beasts into a stampede, but enough with the raptors already.  Kong or one of the T-Rex's would have sufficed.My biggest grief with the movie was the bat scene.  Using one as a hang-glider was just plain bad.  Luckily, the scene is short and thus a little more forgivable.  Don't get me wrong, though.  Whereas the scenes in the city were the highlight of the previous movies, the jungle action was probably the pinnacle of this film, for good or ill.  The bugs scene, probably another nod to the original ""snake pit"" footage that was cut due to its grisliness (if I recall correctly) and subsequently lost to time, was utterly disturbing and the effects fantastic.Speaking of effects, I agree with some reviewers that Kong himself seemed to have slightly varying sizes throughout the movie, but I'm not sure everyone is considering the beast's surroundings.  He's obviously going to look bigger inside a New York theatre as compared to the top of the Empire State Building.  I can certainly forgive a few feet here or there if it's done for good cinematic effect.Another question mark is the taxi cab chase.  As fun as it was to watch, just what was the character trying to accomplish?  Instead of leaving Kong to his business of smashing a bus all to pieces, he leads him on a romp through the city causing untold amounts of carnage and property damage.  I guess you could argue that he had the best of intentions (draw the beast away from the bus) and, again, didn't have a lot of time to think about the repercussions.So you must be wondering, after all of the low points I've detailed and the explanations I've given for dubious areas of the film, why I was so high on it walking out.  It cannot be fully explained in words.  The detail of the early city scenes, the character building on the boat, the dramatic build up to the finding of the isle, the sweeping landscapes of the jungle, the terror of the native attack, the dinosaur fight scenes, the vertigo of the airplane assault scenes all must be experienced (preferably in the theater) to be understood.  I even enjoyed the ""ice skating"" scene, but then I'm a sucker for whimsical brutes.Though you can debate the nuances and certain parts of the storyline, I can't see how anyone can reasonably argue that Peter Jackson did a disservice to the Kong franchise with this incarnation.  I would be inclined to say just the opposite: that the atmosphere of the film alone was worth the price of admission.  But hey, take any review with a grain of salt, especially from a self-proclaimed fanboy."	5.0	King Kong: a Fanboy's Rational Review	2006-06-14	12	9	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2ORGSOR2GDS3	Jason	"When I heard (or read) that Peter Jackson was going to remake King Kong, I was excited to see it, mainly because special effects have advanced so much since the 1933 original film and the 1976 remake. I knew Jackson's work in the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy was spectacular, so I figured that would translate well into King Kong. I was not disappointed one bit. The special effects were amazing, as I knew they would be. What I did not expect, and quite frankly, what no one expected, was the incredibly emotional and heartbreaking aspects of the film. I rarely shed tears at a movie, but this one had me shedding quite a few. I have never seen a more moving film than King Kong. The reason why is because 2005's Kong is not a ""monster,"" as he has been portrayed in the past. He is a real gorilla in this film (albiet 25 feet tall), and that is the difference. When you see him suffer, you're watching a majestic animal suffer, not a ""horrific beast."" The relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow is a friendship, not a ""love/lust"" interest. You realize Kong is very lonely, the last of his kind, and in Darrow, he has finally found a friend, one that he is willing to give his life to protect. That's what makes his ultimate demise so heartwrenching in this film.Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece. Yes, the special effects and action sequences are stunning, but what is more stunning is the emotional impact of this monumental film. If there's one thing I wish Jackson had changed from the original film in his new version, it was the tragic ending-I just wish Kong would've lived. Ultimately, however, I think this film is unquestionably the greatest remake ever, and one of the best films I've ever seen."	5.0	Completely Amazing!	2006-04-08	3	1	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ	Jason	The obvious star of this film is the talented visual-effects team.  They managed to revive a story that is all too well known, allowing even fans of the original classic to enjoy it like new.  It really is amazing how spectacularly they were able to achieve the feeling of newness from one of the classics.Aside from the special effects team, the only other star that truly shines is Naomi Watts.  Watts manages to convey all sorts of emotions, evoking real care and sympathy from the audience.  The viewer wants - at least I did - King Kong to survive, just so the love doesn't die.  Watts really pulls it off; she is magnificent.The early scenes from New York, the shots from Skull Island's fortress, and the amazing wildlife soon thereafter were all a testament to the special-effects team (although the Kong vs. 3 T-Rex fight reminded me of the choreography of the Hulk vs. the 3 mutant dogs in the most recent Hulk movie); I was in awe at the realism.The final scene, which makes this a sad story, is tragic and epic at the same time.  The battle between Kong and the airplanes, flying by and gunning mercilessly, reminds of an earlier battle that Kong had with some strange winged beasts, is set atop the Empire State Building, where Kong lives his final moments of life.  Even to the end, Kong's pureness and beauty shines through, protecting Watts until his death.  It's emotional, classic, and one of the best movie endings ever.I love this remake more than the original black and white version, simply brilliant.	5.0	Epic, amazing, and sad	2006-04-29	4	2	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A13BLSXL78EMRX	Jason Troy	To movie goers everywhere, the remake of a classic film has always been one of colossal disappointment. The film King Kong which originated in the 1930's has stood the test of time. In 1976, a remake was offered with Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lang. However, despite Bridges' enormous talent, the film itself fell well short of the mark. In the original it was Robert Armstrong, Fay Wray and Bruce Cabot who challenged the might of King Kong. In this new version, director Peter Jackson combines the talents of Jack Black as Carl Denham, Naomi Watts, as Ann Darrow and Adrian Brody as the hero against the Eight Wonder of the World. Asides from the fantastic new animatronic scenes which adds towering adventure and blood curling excitement, the real 'special' effect to this new version is King Kong himself. Adroitly brought to life by Andy Serkis, the giant ape not only displays unbridled power, explosive terror, but a deep sympathetic quality which elicits long over due admiration for the creature. So much so, one wishes the ending would not finish like the original. All in all, this remake is truly a welcomed contender to the original, earning the director and his cast enormous applause for a film which not only hit it's mark, but does so with fulsome praise from audiences everywhere. Well done! *****	5.0	A classic Revisited	2006-04-03	3	2	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3JXVV1QJ68PAX	Jason Wilkerson	I must say, this film completely threw me for a loop, mainly because I didn't expect it to be so good. Typically, remakes don't ever have the charisma and energy of the original but if any do it would be this one.The actions of the tribal people once Denham's people reach Skull Island appears to be more of a calloused reaction to the others who have come to Skull Island trying to exploit the island that time forgot. It would also be fear of the monsters that inhabit the island, and what would happen to them if explorers came stirring up trouble with the monsters. I say this because there has been a little bit of talk about racism in this movie, but I don't find it to be racist at all, there's also a scene where a black man on the crew turns out to be the most noble and brave of them all. If anything the reactions in the scenes with the tribes would show racism toward the white people, who think they own everything and have the right to exploit an island and it's living creatures.The movie is very violent, but is virtually bloodless. The fighting sequences do have a tendency to be shaky and jumpy, and depending on the viewer this can become a little frustrating, it didn't bother me at all though. Of course, like any movie dealing with dinosaurs, an island that time forgot, and a massive ape there are a lot of things that seem too unreal, but that's because it's a movie where everything is not real. Isn't one of the points of a movie escapism though? So we really shouldn't be worried about whether or not vines could hold up a squirming T-rex. (Although if you wanted to point that out as an unrealistic fact of the movie, remember that this is the place that time forgot.)There is a very creepy scene dealing with a bunch of bugs in a kind of valley like area. In this scene, a bunch of creatures that appear to look like crickets, leeches, grubs, etc. come out of mud and caves around the area to devour the crew that's out searching for Anne Darrow. This is the breathtaking spider sequence that was cut from the original version of this movie. As this is a monster movie, it seemed appropriate, especially to give you a good idea of what kind of place Skull Island is. The movie doesn't insinuate that nature is a very dangerous place if you can tell reality from fiction. (Especially considering that most cave dwelling creatures are fragile, blind, and totally harmless.) Skull Island though, is not typical nature, it's a forgotten island that is nearly uninhabitable, which is one of the draws for Carl Denham.There are a lot of questions that people can ask when going to see a movie like this, but why would you want to ask them? There's no point to question movies like this because their made for fun, their made to stretch technology, and to live out a filmmaker's dream, the dream that made him become a filmmaker. So don't question it, go along for the ride and have fun.P.S.-The movie is rated PG-13 for a reason. Take your kids into the movie with caution, I would recommend viewing the movie before them. (I work in a video store, and there we aren't even aloud to view PG-13 movies in the store for the cursing and the questions they bring up.) While King Kong isn't as graphic in some ways as Titanic, Titanic is a perfect example of why you would want to view the movie prior to allowing children to view it.	5.0	Awesome	2006-01-02	1	1	0

He really tried hard with this role, but in the end, was not very convincing.  Jack is known for his intensity, and it simply was not there in this film.Some of violence in the film seemed somewhat gratuitious and forced...certainly some of the scenes on Skull Island could have been cut back without losing the impact - personally I thought the Brontosaurus ""pile-up"" was ridiculous. It's also doubtful that the real Ann Darrow would've survived the g-forces she was subjected to during the chase scenes...I can only suspend so much disbelief.  I will admit that whoever was assigned to the facial expression on Kong did an excellent job - he or she was able to show emotion and understanding in every expression.The chase through New York was again pointlessly long.  I thought it was strange that Ann Darrow didn't suffer hypothermia, having been exposed to freezing temperatures for, by my estimation, at least an hour.Whoever was in charge of the script really missed a couple of good opportunities to bring a bit of humor to a couple of situations which would've gone a long way in making the film a bit more engaging and enjoyable.I don't think this movie deserves all the kudos it's received...it seems to have been made to make a few bucks...I'm sorry Peter, overall I felt it was just average."	3.0	Not a complete disappointment	2006-04-12	4	2	2

Adrian Brody seemed like he'd rather be back in Dresden, and although Naomi Watts showed some flashes and looked like she was ready to do some real acting at a moment's notice, she eventually succumbed to poor writing and directing.After a solid hour of tedious and unsuccessful character development, this indulgent movie spent another hour trying to decide if it was Jurassic Park or Lord of the Rings.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2T2W8VMACIB7Q	Jeff Gough	"King Kong contains more breathtaking moments than any movie I've ever seen.  From a scene where someone is wildly shooting giant mosquitos with a machine gun (without hitting the person the mosquitos are swarming around) to the power of love between woman and ape.  It all culminates with a majestic ice skating scene that will bring you back to the nostalgia of Brian Boitano.  I love movies that find a way to make the unnatural (a giant, wild ape playfully ice skating in a foreign land with a human being he has developed feelings for) seem natural.This movie teaches that if you want something bad enough, you can get it.  Example, the giant ape learns to speak the word ""beautiful"" both in sign language *and* in English!  The irony here is that he thought the sunset and woman were beautiful, but he probably lacked the intelligence to grasp that his behavior that night was the most beautiful thing of all!"	5.0	Breathtaking	2007-01-05	2	1	1

The horrific tribe that abducts Ann Darrow. The raw trerror and power that Kong exudes. The jaw dropping dangers of the prehistroric Island. Jack Black's ambitious, manipulative movie producer is perfect.Alas, there are weaknesses as well. (Spoiler alerts): Kong battles large T-Rex style dinosaurs, as he holds Ann in alternative hand and foot grabs. C'mon... the woman would be inadvertently crushed during such a combat! How much more believable would it had been, to have Kong tuck Ann in some safe hiding place.The woman has the luck of Indiana Jones, escaping death about a thousand times.The movie has far too many ""tortured close- ups"" of Naomi Watts and crew.Many of the tender scenes involving Ann and Kong are masterful. But PLEASE, PLEASE... why the scene of Kong repeatedly sliding around on ice, in Central Park? He's being playful, Ann is laughing for some odd reason... has she forgotten that her large hairy friend is in mortal danger? (As are any hapless humans who get in Kong's way!) I could had accepted the scene, if Ann maintained her concern for Kong and prompted him to keep moving.The climax at the Empire State Building is very well done, but too tortured. It ran about five minutes longer than it should of, with far too many ""cry with Ann"" scenes.  Too much of a good thing isn't necessarily good.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2BC978GQQEA2A	Jeffrey Pidgeon	"Oscars are powerful things. For some, they are simply paths to better projects and pay. For others, Academy Awards are the brass ring on the carosel, allowing filmmakers a free ride on their next project. It's often manifested in a long-sidelined dream film - in Peter Jackson's case, that means a remake of his first inspiration, ""King Kong"".These projects are usually sidelined for a reason, and in the cases of ""Toys"", ""Joe Versus The Volcano"", ""One From The Heart"", or ""Heaven's Gate"", the Oscar-won dream can (at best) leave audiences scratching their heads. The biggest compliment I can give this lush, overstuffed remake is that it does evoke (and sometimes enhance) the pathos of the story that has until now eluded me. At last, I was able to get a sense of what it would have been like to have seen the original as a child.It's the story of Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a down-on-her-luck actress who's forced to explore the burlesque circuit. She meets Carl Denham (Jack Black), on-the-run filmmaker, con artist, and showman. He invites her to be the lead in his next adventure epic, which just happens to be written by her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll (Adrian Brody). It takes a little while, but eventually we're aboard a tramp steamer (with Ann and Jack locking eyes), heading not to the Singapore location, but the mysterious Skull Isand. Carl's hoping that between his map, Jack's script and the unknown jungle, he can conjure up an adventure film that'll get him out of dutch with his studio bosses.He - and we - get a lot more than he bargained for. There's a fogbank and a shipwreck before Carl and his crew make their way ashore. At first, the isle seems deserted, but later we find that there are indeed islanders to contend with. A fierce battle ensues, Ann is kidnapped and presented as an offering to a mysterious creature thought to be legend. Kong.It's love at first sight for the big guy - he spirits Ann away, and the middle third of the film is primarily expended in the others' efforts to rescue her. Unfortunately for the ship's crew, Skull Island is jam-packed with other giant beasties. Dinosaurs! Stampeding herbivores! Slithering, croc-like carnivores! Centipedes! Spider-scorpions! Bats! And worse. Our heroes fight them all in one set piece after another. The effects work begins to slip in quality under the load, but more importantly, none of this is necessary to the story.Fortunately, we do get to see what is - Ann and Kong alone together in the jungle. Using today's new technologies to maximum advantage, watching them form a bond is funny, tense, and genuinely touching. Similar to the original, Kong defends his maiden from a Tyrannosaur, though a couple more are thrown in for good measure. There's a melancholy quality to Kong's territory, littered with the bones of his fellow apes. We're also shown a reason why Kong makes his canonical skyscraper climb in the first place.By the time Jack comes to the rescue, Carl has abandoned his film ambitions, setting his sights on Kong himself. Using the ship's stores, and with Ann and Jack as bait, the crew manages to subdue and capture the ape, preparing him as a sideshow attraction on Broadway. It's a cruel, painful sequence, effective but perhaps overemphasized, considering what is to come.The climax in New York, happily, is the film's shining hour, the most polished and emotional portion of the film, vividly illustrating (and building upon) the tragic power of the original. Interestingly, some of the most effective shots render Kong tiny, dwarfed and surrounded by the civilization that will ultimately destroy him. It's fantastic stuff, and well worth the wait.The film loses some battles, though, on the way to its third-act victory. The opening's introduction of Ann is awkward, and could be trimmed or eliminated entirely. While the performances of the cast are strong across the board, many of the crew members are over-developed, adding to the film's considerable paunch. ""Kong"" is a big story, but it doesn't necessarily need the ensemble-epic-treatment that served Jackson so well in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. While nearly every monster battle would be exciting in isolation, they begin to provoke impatience when assembled in a train. The ""Rings"" films don't require as much of a sense of economy, but this pile-it-on mentailty threatens to capsize ""Kong"".In this case, it might be prudent to revisit the film for the DVD release with a shorter cut, rather than the extended versions that Jackson prefers. Considering the reworking his films get for home video, a streamlined edit might get ""Kong"" much closer to the great film that it could be."	3.0	Super Size It	2006-04-13	0	0	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	"Peter Jackson has followed up his wonderful ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy with an astounding remake of of King Kong that will leave you spellbound.Jack Black stars as Carl Denham, a movie producer who is going to make a movie aboard a ship.  However, he secretly wants to find the uncharted Skull Island.  Unfortunately for Carl, his leading lady has disappeared, leaving his movie venture up in the air.  Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a struggling vaudeville actress who has just lost her most recent job due to the closing of the club where she was working.  By chance, Carl and Ann meet, and Carl offers the job of his leading lady role to her.  Ann accepts, and soon the members of the movie crew, including script writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) are on the S.S Venture bound for Singapore; or at least that was the plan.Filming starts on Carl's movie, but while on board , the ship's captain receives a message that there is a warrant for Carl's arrest.  He is to change his course and head for Rangoon.  However, the ship encounters a dense fog bank and it slams into the rocky coast of an island. Skull Island.Carl, Ann, Jack, and the others set off to explore the island.  Soon, they run across some blood-thirsty natives who succeed in killing several members of the party.  The ship's captain comes to the resuce in the nick of time, and everyone heads back to the S.S. Venture to prepare to set sail once high tide frees them from the rocks.  But, the natives manage to board the ship undetected and kidnap Ann.Ann is bound and tied to a wooden rack and offered as a sacrifice to an amazing and mythical creature; a huge gorilla called King Kong.  Kong scoops up Ann in his huge hand and bounds away.  The others aboard the S.S. Venture soon realize that Ann is missing and head back to the island to rescue her.  But, Ann soon realizes that Kong doesn't intend to harm her.  In fact, she begins to like him as well.  But the determined crewmembers are intent on getting Ann back no matter what the cost.Fierce fighting breaks out on the island as Kong fights against crewmembers and creatures alike, including three T-Rexs who try to kill Ann.  The fight sequence between Kong and the dinosaurs is one of the best sequences of the entire film.  Jack, having had his movie camera smashed to bits during one of the chases, comes up with another idea.  He wants to capture Kong and bring him back to the mainland and make a fortune on admission fees.  With the help of the remaining members of the Venture's crew, they manage to sedate the mighty Kong and bring him back to New York City.Soon, Jack is standing before a packed auditorium with the curtain drawn.  The curtain goes up, and there is Kong, shackled with heavy iron chains.  Kong is still sedated, so at first he doesn't do too much.  But when he realizes that the girl brought onstage is not Ann, he goes beserk, rips off his chains, and goes on a rampage through the streets of New York.  Meanwhile, at a nearby club, Ann hears the commotion in the streets.  She sees one of Jack's promotional flyers blow by her window, and she immediately knows what's happening.  She walks out into the night to find Kong.Once together, Ann and Kong somehow end up on an ice skating pond, with Kong laughing and playing on the ice.  However, this carefree moment is short-lived, as the New York National Guard finds them and begins shooting artillery at Kong.  Scooping Ann up in his hand, Kong heads for higher ground, namely, the top of the Empire State Building.  Kong, seeming to know what his ultimate fate will be, scales the building until he reaches the top, all the while carefully carrying Ann in his hand like a newborn.  Once on top and having suffered numerous hits from the guns of airplanes buzzing around them, Kong and Ann share a final, tender moment.This is a tremendous film, and it deserves much more than five stars.  The special effects are simply out of this world.  The scenes on top of the Empire State Building are the best in the movie, with Kong swatting planes out of the sky like mosquitos.  But beyond the special effects, the story is very good, and touching as well.  The relationship between Kong and Ann is very moving, and you can see how much Kong cares for her by the way he protects her from danger throughout the movie.  The final scene on top of the Empire State Building is probably the most moving scene in the film.  Kong, resigned to his fate, makes sure right up until the very end, that Ann is safe.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The special effects will blow you away, but what will keep you watching is the touching and genuine relationship between a beautiful woman and a large but caring gorilla.  Enjoy."	5.0	Simply Amazing	2006-04-21	7	5	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A34KYDBILKXGV0	Jeff R.	This movie was the main reason I bought into the whole HD DVD thing.  As one of my favorites of 2005, I highly anticipated its release to HD, especially since I figured it would get one heck of a treatment.  I was right about part of it; the A/V quality is among the best I've seen, despite the lack of a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It's definitely the title I'd use to show off what HD DVD can do; however, the lack of extras is a little disappointing, mainly because Amazon has it priced so darn high.  27 bucks is way too much for the title, when other new releases have sub-$20 price tags.Bottom line: the HD DVD comes highly recommended, but only if you can get it for a more reasonable price.	3.0	Excellent movie and reference quality HD treatment, but...	2006-11-27	13	12	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3PGVZDO70DIEL	Jeff Rundberg	King Kong is a well put together movie (both the movie itself and the 3-Disc Deluxe Edtion DVD).  State of the art special effects, great characters, action, drama, comedy, and Peter Jackson's directing.  Easily his best movie since 'Dead Alive' (a.k.a. 'Braindead').  Jackson stayed true to the 1933 original that he loved so much by remaking the movie with today's technology.  He even used some of the same lines and action sequences from the original (albeit with a little flare).  While some may see this as laziness, I see it as Jackson's homage to the one movie that inspired him to be a filmmaker.Some reviewers have had a problem with the casting.  I couldn't disagree more.  Firstly, Naomi Watts is one of the greatest actresses of all time.  I enjoy anything and everything she does.  She can say so much with her face, which is important in this movie as her part (Ann Darrow) is light on dialogue.  Her character is extremely important because she has the most interaction with Kong (our title character) and we learn a lot of what is happening with Kong through her.  Although the filmmakers did such a fantastic job with the special effects and motion capture that Kong himself is also very good at expressing his feelings (sans any dialogue,of course), a lot of which is due to the multi-talented Andy Serkis.  Jack Black is fantastic (he's the character you love to hate in this movie) and Adrian Brody is good as always.I have to mention that so far this may be one of the best DVDs in terms of special features that I have seen so far.  It's not the only one that has hours of behind the scenes material, but it is the only one that I have been able to watch all of those hours without actually getting bored (many thanks go to Jack Black for this).  The cast and crew really had a great time shooting this movie and it shows.  And as a bonus all of the special feature footage is shot in widscreen so you don't have to adjust the ratio on your TV.So, if you like monster movies: watch this movie.  If you like Peter Jackson: watch this movie.  If you like Naomi Watts (if anybody doesn't I want to talk to you): watch this movie.  If you like crazy action, including giant apes, dinosaurs, giant insects and slugs, etc.: watch this movie.  I would like to personally thank Peter Jackson for making this movie.  I will enjoy it always.	5.0	Wow! Cinematic bliss.	2007-10-22	3	2	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A271F0OB0FIXAN	J. E. Nachamkin	"Sorry, Peter J., loved LOTR but you couldn't one-up yourself.  If you know the history of the very first Kong movie then you'llrealize that Jackson over indulged his own fantasy and failed to improve on the original simple but effective story line. He did manage to blow me away with the sp. effects but wouldn't that have been sufficient?  No he had to triple the number of T. rex adversaries as if one one was was just not enough for todays audience. A colosal encounter with one T. rex with realistic body trauma, not ""Disneyesque"" PG damage would have been far more scarier and involving.  One more peeve,  New York in the dead of Winter in a strapless gown on the top of the Empire State building with no wind.  Not!  Jackson convinced me there is a 30 foot tall ape but not that he has been to New York.  This type of incongruity diminished a potentially great film.  Hopefully, there will be a one hour shorter ""directors cut"" then Ill watch it again."	3.0	The directors cut should be one hour shorter!	2006-04-19	4	3	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	Who could have taken the 100-minute original and nearly doubled it for a remake. I could not think of a better director for this type of film than Peter Jackson. He has turned this classic story into a slam-bang spectacle, with more action than many could've predicted. King Kong is also way more emotional than I personally expected.Ann Darrow's relationship with Kong is depicted in a superior way to the original movie. Despite the unbelievable stop-motion effects in the original, I always thought Kong lacked in persona. Well, that has changed. The viewers will have no trouble seeing what Kong's going through, and those eyes of his are probably the saddest sight. Adrien Brody plays a great Jack Driscoll as well. Brody is truly a gifted actor and plays a good hero.Even Jack Black did a good job as the rebellious director Carl Denham. Usually I am annoyed by Black's performances, even though they are mostly in comedies. Surprisingly, Black kept his character serious and the movie is better for it. I though for sure he would be the one to ruin this movie for me but, again, I stand corrected. The comedy seemed to be reserved for Kong, himself, and did a wonderful job.Jackson & Company give the big guy plenty of dizzying set pieces to show his stuff, involving everything from dinosaurs, toothy insects (as long as your arm), and speeding taxicabs in New York City traffic (the scene where Brody did his own stunt driving; all those years of drag-racing on the streets of Wood haven, Queens really paid off! :-), to say nothing of the dazzling Empire State Building climax. Moreover, Andrew Lesnie's cinematography is as gorgeous as it is kinetic. Do I recommend this film? Of course. You'll probably enjoy it immensely, despite it's over length.	4.0	King Kong's triple dinosaur fight was amazing!	2006-06-24	9	4	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ANNLMATZ4GOJP	"jermy man ""jerm"""	Going into this movie i had a pretty open mind, then the first hour pasted, then the next half hour, by this time my patience was wearing thin. I was expecting some good special effects hense me being a LOTR's fan, well thats what i got but in way to big of a dose. The action sequences in this film are just WAY to drawn out, dinosaurs falling like a pile of linebackers all over one another, people being jerked around, falling, swinging all over the place. Even the fight scenes of Kong vs. the T-rex got realllly old after the first 2 minutes. Computer special effects are really something amazing these days, but a lot of time i'd rather see things done the old fashion way, or just see the idea of less is more. Perhaps that's why i usually don't rent large computerized action movies like, The Matrix, Spiderman, Batman Begins, Fantastic Four, this etc. Maybe age is catching up with me but at this point i prefer pyschological horror, or just a good mystery(drama), the movies now are just to over the top with CGI, and long drawn out 15 minute+action sequences. The story in this movie is probably the reason i never really watched the orginal KK movies, just didnt interest me, still doesnt. Also i've never really been a fan of the 30's era, even if it is action packed. I will say yes that Peter Jackson has once again made something pretty epic, its just a bit TO epic for my tastes. Personally i'd rather watch Raiders Of The Lost Ark over again. ha Or even the fist Lord of The Rings.	2.0	Nothing left to the imagination anymore	2006-04-02	11	5	6
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3SIJ2IXS7EGS2	Jerome Y. Hebert	"Perhaps I'm one of those terminally jaded people who's finally realized that no matter how much an amazingly creative artist tries to spice up the story, ""King Kong"" can stand only so many revisions before you start thinking ""Enough is REALLY enough!""I've tried twice to sit down and watch this film fairly and conscientiously.  But despite its marvellous special effects, this latest retelling of the Big Ape Tale simply fails to nudge, let alone embrace, my rapt attention.  What am I looking at here?  Is it horror?  Is it social commentary?  Is it Sci-Fi?  Is it slap-stick?  Is it outright parody of putting as much SX frosting as possible on a cake that has gotten so stale even the ants are looking for a new picnic?  Maybe a little bit of each. Maybe none of the above.  Heck, maybe it's even an effort to use those Orcs left over from LOTR by recycling them as Skull Islanders...  One question I had was figuring out *what* I was watching.  A more serious question developed as the film proceeded through 30, 40, 50 minutes; that was ""Why am I watching this?.""I'm sorry to say that this remake of ""King Kong"" isn't going to make my top ten films list.  Perhaps I'll feel a little more compassionate toward it once I succeed in forcing myself to watch the entire film.  But the fact that I'll be using force of will to do so doesn't seem promising.Tastes differ, of course, and I have friends who rave about what a monumentally entertaining and exciting film this is.  But after two very well-intentioned attempts to uncover the source of their enthusiasm, I'm beginning to question their taste (or mine).  When it comes down to putting one's money where one's opinion lies, my personal advice would be to rent this flic before buying it."	3.0	Can't Fault the Special Effects, But...	2006-04-05	6	4	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ALTNI5BAFUAQY	"Jery Tillotson ""cult author"""	Don't mess with a legend.Especially a movie so iconic and mythical as the original l933 King Kong. The reason its become a much beloved legend,TV staple is that it only runs 112 minutes and it moves so fast that you just sit there, stunned, as the excitement builds steadily until that unforgettable death of King Kong.Peter Jackson spent over 200 million dollars on this nearly 4 hour epic--when at least two hours could have easily been cut. Instead, we spend nearly an hour, stuck in the beginning in NYC, as we watch long, never-ending backstories of each of the main characters.Then we have to watch a miserably miscast gallery of performers. All of them are talented in their own way, but Naomi Watts is so atheletic and feisty as Ann Darrow that we can't really sympathize with her plight. It was Fay Wray's fragile but sensuous beauty that made her a perfect heroine. Jack Black is hideously midcast as voyage leader, Carl Denham. You keep waiting for him to break into one of his potty-saturated routines. Instead, he comes across as some smarmy, sneaky creep.One grows incresingly bored at the long, never-ending shots of Naomi Watts face. She stares at Adrian Brody--her sweetheart--in long, endless takes. When she's not staring at Adrian Brody, she stares for endless minutes at King Kong. Toward the end, nearly half an hour is spent as the camera never leaves her staring face and then this is repeated with King Kong staring at Ann Darrow. Back and forth, stares galore, and I kept looking at the clock. Then we see Jack Black's face--with the camera studying his every pore as he stares intently at something beyond the camera range. One minute passes, then another, then a third of Jack Black's face--all for what?The sequence that really made me groan in disbelief is the big moment when King Kong is unveiled at a NYC theater. Instead of Ann Darrow as the star performer, they have a fake Ann Darrow. The real one, for reasons never explained, is performing in a chorus line down the street. Wouldn't you expect that someone like Ann Darrow, a struggling stage performer, would want to share in the spotlight with King kong? Adrian Brody is also in another theater watching his drama unfold. Yet, throughout the movie, he has been one of the action characters, who helps bring Kong back to NYC. I couldn't imagine anyone in NYC at that time wanting to sit through a boring dramatic play when King Kong is being presented live just down the street.If this movie had two hours pruned from it, this might save it, but for me, one time was much too much to watch this dazzling epic, that quickly bores with its illogic story line and staring performers.	2.0	Jackson the Joker	2009-03-15	3	1	2

Yes, it is wonderful to watch Naomi Watts - beautiful and talented. But Adrian Brody is one of the most unattractive males in leading roles today. The ""mud people"" of Skull Island are also particularly unattractive.The stampede of dinosaurs is extremely well done, but could easily have been more effective if the time was cut in half. Yes, the kids will love it, but it slows the story needlessly.There is also too much footage of Miss Watts entertaining Kong and his reactions to her antics. It becomes a case of ""let's get on with the story"".This film is an example of let's do it because we can, rather than do it to tell a good story.

The Dinosaurs looked great but it felt like this film was chasing Jurassic Park instead of the 1935 Original. The Dinosaur stampede was absolutely Ridiculous and the fight with the multiple T-Rexes looked like Kong playing Hacky-Sack with Naomi Watts as he did Gorilla MMA. The fight looked like it belonged in Kung Fu Panda. King Kong the creature itself was very good, he looked realistic and moved like a gorilla but the rest of the film was very weak.

Peter Jackson proved me wrong though because he created one stunning and exciting piece of work.  The first hour can drag on too long. But I guess that first hour is for the actress Anne (Naomi Watts) and Jack the screenwriter (Adrian Brody) to get to know each other and fall in love. They're on a ship headed to skull island  where the movie director played by Jack Black wants to film his movie.When they get to skull island they meet some crazy natives that are very creepy looking. The narrowly esacpe the natives but the natives already decided they want to use Anne as a sacrifice for the giant Ape Kong. They steal her from the ship. Kong of course takes Anne from the natives willingly. Anne is scared to death but soon realizes he isn't that bad. Jackson handles their realationship with great warmth. They have touching and sweet scenes together. Like when they stare at a sunset together on skull island or slide on an icey lake together laughing in NY.Jackson really makes us like this Kong and care about him. Naomi Watts is great as well. She's sweet and loveable and you really believe that she cares for Kong. She possibly gives the best performance in any of the versions of Kong. I love the scene where  a T-Rex is after Anne and she stands in front of Kong with a  ""go ahead and try it"" attitude. The length is to develop her relationships with Kong and Jack. Which makes this the fully developed version of King Kong. Watching it, you realize that even the classic 1933 film wasn't fully developed. Anne certainly doesn't  feel as comfortable around Kong in the original as she does here. Kong is just a lonely giant ape who wants a friend and Anne is just as lonely and searching for something as well. This version gets to you and even gets a tear or two out of you. By the end your just about as attached to Kong as Anne is.

When first word came out that Jack Black would be one of the leading characters, I thought that might be a somewhat risky move, and it is my belief, though I like him a lot, there is hardly no other with as much energy as Black, he wasn't right for the part.  However, luckily, the leading man was not a man, but an ape, the king of all apes.  His (Kong's) eyes glossed wet from loneliness and pain, until that very day he met Ann (Naomi Watts).  This three plus hour movie wasn't about the actors, it was about Jackson's ability to bring emotions and life to this character of Kong.  The movie consisted of three chapters, chapter one, Jack Black trying to make it big; a sleazy guy, movie producer, willing to do anything to get his movie done-Probably ""the one"" part of this picture that took it out of Oscar nomination for best picture for the somewhat tedious set-up to Chapter two.  Chapter two, the island and the revealing of Kong.  Chapter three, the return to New York with a captured Kong.  If you know the story of King Kong, or saw the original, you ultimately know what happens.  Jackson, didn't waiver too much from the original story, he kept it a period piece.  I really don't like films like this, the innocent, the unknowing, the lost, ultimately being treated with such injustice and cruelty, however, Jackson, was able to close the chapter on this magnificent tale in a way that didn't make you feel good, but didn't necessarily make you feel so bad that you wished you had never see it.  You were too overwhelmed at this leading man's (Kong's) ability to show emotions, to take over the movie and to guide us along to new heights in the storytelling business and ultimately remembering that the good guy doesn't always win.  Of course again, you were also overwhelmed at the special effects of the movie.  If you want a movie that is overtaken by excellent special effects and superb character development of Kong, then this is the movie for you.  The secondary characters played their parts well, especially Watts ability to connect with Kong, but the movie, in a nut-shell is about Kong and if Jackson was able to pull it off-Which he did."	4.0	And the Oscar for best actor goes to...King Kong!	2006-04-03	4	3	1

Watching this modern version helps you appreciate the work of animal rights activists- this beast has a soul! Naomi Watts does an amazing job I think getting across a believable performance that she actually cares for this giant beast despite having no spoken dialogue with Kong. Jack Black is also well cast as the funny, but ambitious adventurer that you love and hate at the same time.Brilliant depiction of the other beasts on skull island including the super scary locals, some of the most scary scenes in the film without a doubt. I don't think I will allow my kids to watch this one for a while, but I think there are good lessons there for teenagers and older to see and learn from.I think the people of the world could do with a more daunting feeling about nature and animals- we have controlled and killed most beasts on the planet, dangerous or not- it is a shame there aren't giant killer animals to intimidate us and put us in our place, it might make people respect nature and the environment more. I would prefer to be scared of giant beasts over global warming, terrorist attacks and war anyday.	5.0	A more Realistic Beauty and the Beast Love Story with Fantastic Special Effects	2006-08-06	2	1	1

Many of the scenes are dragged out way too far, and some of the stuff going on in the jungle is just ridiculous.The Lord of The Rings trilogy is a great example. i loved those three movies, but I fast forwarded through at least a third of them.

Jaco	"Kids today may not have been interested in sitting down to watch the old King Kong and the Jessica Lange remake, but they will be with this one.  Good casting, reasonable acting, especially Naomi Watts and Adrian Brody, and outstanding effects make this a solid fantasy movie to watch.Very much showing a ""comic book"" approach to camera angles and stilted dialog in the live action sequences, the film is most remarkable when Kong is in the scene, especially when coupled with the lovely Watts.  Furthermore, as a thrill ride, Jackson challenges many human phobias in ways reminiscent of Indiana Jones movies.  In the same way, ""Everyman"" Adrian Brody is often surprising as the unassuming hero, not unlike Indiana Jones, too.Many complain about the film's length, and I can't argue that the film didn't need some deletions for time, but it's clear that the director was very interested in showing what he could do with his animation effects.  So he did and the film grew in length to accommodate.  So, yes, there are lulls, but there are subtleties in those lulls, too.  A careful viewer will find lots to be entertained by in this movie - just remember to suspend disbelief and all will be well."	4.0	Honorable update of venerable classic -- and thrill ride, too!	2006-01-12	6	2	4

In this new, modern, fast paced and exciting film we are transported into the world of Kong and swept away its storytelling.  It is nothing short of a miracle that Peter Jackson has been able to bring this story to a contemporary audience and retell the story of Kong without said audience laughing.  It is both epic in scale and human in its pathos -- we care about Kong -- when was the last time you had true emotion for a CGI character is recent memory?

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3GUTAC5UVKUH	Joe Carugati	"King Kong...having viewed the 1933 version a long time ago, I still remember seeing the claymation and funny animations of Kong and the dinosaurs.  Although it was far from realistic, it was still a lot of fun to watch.Fast forward 72 years and now Academy Award winner Peter Jackson is finally doing the picture he's always wanted to make.  Having enjoyed Jackson's other films such as ""The Frighteners"" (underrated), and the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" (just perfect), I was looking forward to this remake a lot, even though I'm not a big fan of remakes in the first place.  Yet, Kong seemed like it needed to be updated and that's what Jackson did with CGI....lots of CGI...did I say CGI?Before I get into my qualms with the film, I explain the story.  The film takes place in New York in the 1930's and we are introduced to Carl Denham (Jack Black), who has just chartered a boat to Skull Island to film his next picture.  After learning from his assistant, Preston (Colin Hanks), that their main actress just dropped out, he finds Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a down on her luck actress who is looking for a job.  Taking Ann and Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), a playwright and also writer of Denham's script, he sets up his crew and ship and takes off to Skull Island.When they finally reach Skull Island, they learn what the island is hiding: creepy natives, dinosaurs, spiders, centipedes, man-eating grubs, and a big hairy ape...and yes, they are all CGI.At the island, Ann falls into the hands (and heart) of King Kong, the big ape and saves her from many of the island's beasts.  The crew of the ship believe that Kong would make a fortune as a showcase back in New York, so they capture him and bring him back to the big Apple, where he breaks loose and looks for his love...Ann.Now, I'm sorry if I just kind of breezed through the plot summary or gave some things away, but the story is basically identical to the original, except for now we have...CGI.Okay, well let me talk about what I did like...- I thought the action sequences were pretty superb even if far-fetched.  They kept my adrenaline pumping and were very enthralling.  They don't let up at all once the crew is on Skull Island.- the characters in the story were nicely fleshed out.  I enjoyed Adrien Brody and his character and Naomi Watts was a great Ann Darrow.  Going into this film, Jack Black didn't strike me in an action-adventure film.  After seeing ""School of Rock"", ""Orange County"", and other comedies, you wouldn't think it.  Yet, he came through very well and surprised me.  Yet, I really liked the other characters of the crew...Jamie Bell and Andy Serkis in particular were very good and I enjoyed watching them.- Peter Jackson, as always, had some great direction going for him.  The cinematography and action scenes were all perfect.  I just wish the pacing could have been a bit more smooth for me.  It seemed to jump from slow scenes to fast ones, which annoyed me a bit, but was nothing major.- Kong: the main reason to probably see this film.  To say the least, he looked amazing.  The modeling of his face, his actions, and everything were just spot on...too bad the same can't be said for other animals as well.- Peter Jackson also made a few horror films in his time and he shows off some disturbing images in this story.  I liked how this film was a strong PG-13 and didn't pull away a lot.  The scene with the bugs, critters, and spiders in the pit is one of the scariest things I have ever witnessed: period.  Kudos to Peter Jackson for that scene...outstanding.  Be warned though: if you are squeamish or do not like death, this movie is not for you.  A lot of people die in this film and don't think just because it's PG-13, they won't show anything.  It gets nasty...That was mainly the good, now onto the bad.-  relationship between Ann and Kong.  Although cute, I didn't like how it would break into the crew's strugge for survival.  This is where pacing comes into play.  You would have Ann and Kong playing together, then switch to people being eaten by dinosaurs.  Minor qualm.- CGI!  As I stated above, Kong was perfect and awesome in everyway.  The other creatures on the island were okay as well.  The dinosaurs were fine and so were the other critters, but many times it looked as if they were not fully rendered and that detracted from my experience.  Also, I love the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" and I thought the CGI served a purpose in the story.  In ""Kong"", after seeing dinosaurs, centipedes, spiders, and lizards...I was kind of tired when they reached the flying bats, which showed that the CGI became more of a nuisance then ""Oh my God, how did they do that?"".  I wanted to say that line so many times during this movie, but alas, I could not.- the length of the film was just way too long.  Many snippets could have been cut out...that's all that needs to be said.Overall, ""King Kong"" was entertaining, but nowhere near ""classic"" territory.  Peter Jackson again gives us another interesting film with special effects and action, but the length, and CGI overkill seem to damper the experience.  Now, when's ""The Hobbit"" coming out?!Rated PG-13 for strong violence, extremely disturbing images, and some gore."	3.0	Not Peter Jackson's Best...But Not Bad	2005-12-17	8	3	5
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A29H3006SWAGW5	joe	this movie was perfect. Jackson's vision of skull island is the most beutifal place ive ever seen in a movie, and the creatures are wonderfully done.  Kong himself was amazing, he even looks real and his emotinos are shown clearly.  I have heard people complain about the first hour, but it didnt bore me in the least and was neccessary for character development.  The battle between kong and the trio of dinosoars is jaw-dropping.However, there were a few things that bothered me, such as how Carl doesnt care about anything except his movie, i mean, i undestand that was his character, but it was taken to an extreme. There were also a few things here and there, but they are so minute that i am stil giving this movie 5 starsexcellent, must see movie	5.0	spectacular!	2006-04-15	0	0	0

As I watched this movie in the theaters I was not very impressed for the first hour. I felt Jackson spent too much time setting up the rest movie when he really did not need to do so. As a result, the first third of this movie dragged. However, once the movie got to Skull Island things picked up quickly.The second part of the movie is where the film won me over. It took on a Jurassic Park-like feel except better. The special effects were incredible (the clips showen on TV do not do it justice). The battle between Kong and the T-Rexs is sure to become a classic. Also, the relationship between Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) and Kong went much more indepth than the 1933 version. I think Jack Black did a good job in his role although some critics did not think so. Another area of the film that really impressed me was the realistic 1930's New York. I urge anyone who watches the film to look at how detailed the city really is including advertisements for real 1930's radio shows.If not for the slow beginning, I would have given this movie 5 stars.	4.0	The King is back...	2006-03-29	3	1	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1YQHJCC40CS0Q	"John Doggett ""J-Dogg"""	"While not many movies come along that allow you to suspend disbelief, the beginning of this millenium has allowed just that. Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Narnia. My particular tastes run in the boat of giant fantastic creatures that menace others, with or without any logic. I don't know, maybe it's the sense of power that no human could possibly contend with.Frankly, my opinion is very biased based on the fact that every review is such. I love King Kong, as I have since I first saw the remake of the 70's (actually saw that one first). In my view, most remakes of classic monster movies have depleted the sense of awe that the original had. Godzilla (got proof?) is a prime example. The original 1954 classic evoked fear of the war of the 40's due to reverance of the atomic age. Godzilla is that fear reborn in the form of a horrific creature. Roland Emmerich's version is, pardon the language, pussified by comparison.Why does this version of Kong succeed where the American Godzilla failed? Simple. Roland Emmerich had no respect or love of the original vision that was Godzilla. Peter Jackson, however, did, does, and always will have this respect and love of the original Kong.One more thing before I depart. That line of ""'Twas beauty killed the beast"" did not refer to Kong's attempts at winning Anne, but more to the idea that he would risk his own life in order to be with her and protect her. Carl Denham had no idea of Anne's like (or lack thereof) of Kong in this or the original version. He was, however, able to observe how obsessive Kong was to be with her. Anne is no different than how an animal trainer would act after significant time with Kong. There is no proof of Anne loving Kong, only that she pittied him and wanted to see him safe.In my view, Anne was acting the way a trainer would if the animal trainer spent significant time trying to understand and sometimes teach a gorilla about certain things, only to see the gorilla being poched later. Just watch Gorilla's in the Mist to see my point."	5.0	Oh, Please DO go ape over this one.	2005-12-18	4	1	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3BLK7BL8UGH06	John J. Avery	"Incredible effects highlight ""king kong"", but at it's heart this is a love story. you need a lot of moxie to attempt to remake this classic, and jackson, fresh off his success with ""lord of the rings"" does more than a credible job. this is a loving tribute to one of the classics in our film history, and a beautiful version of beauty and the beast. The crew [black, watts, stow-a-way brody] head off for a mythical island just ahead of creditors, where giant creatures roam. the real action starts once they reach skull island, and the encounters there with various creatures are numerous and over the top, remember to check your ""suspension of disbelief"" at the door.  the big battle between kong and the two t-rex I had heard about didn't disappoint,the CGI was very believable.  naomi watts was great as ann darrow. jack black and adrian brody were a bit of a surprise in casting as two important characters, but both did adequately in their roles, the real stars are watts and kong. but to see a racial component is a bit of a reach.The return to new york city is extravagantly overdone,as are the island scenes, but keep in mind this is ""king kong"" we're watching, and everything should be done on a large scale. the streets and buildings in NY glisten, and are stunning to look at.the final scenes in central park and on top of the empire state building  with ann and kong are romantic, and heartbreaking. I'm sure I wasn't the only one with a lump in my throat when ann and kong watch the sunrise together. there have been complaints about the length of the film, but it passed very quickly for me."	5.0	WOW!	2006-07-07	5	2	3

People that think this film is too long need to learn the word patience. Character developement is finally back. O.K., some of the C.G.I. effects are drawn out a little too long, exspecially with the brontasauraus attack and the cockroatches, but personally, with Kong, I was mesmerized by his movements and emotions. Naiomi is a bit too WIDE eyed through out the film, would have appreciated a bit more chat toward Kong but o-well. A bit over the top in a few scenes, but hey, this is the story of a huge ape, anything goes. Jackson captures the emotions big time. Hell, I started welling up as soon as Kong sees his love walking toward him in slow motion in New York. And the finale, just hand me a tissue, end of story. Entertaining and takes you to a dream world for 3 hours, kudos, Mr. Jackson.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AMEBJF54S3XNC	John Maltby	"Let me first say that I am a great fan of Jackson's LOTR trilogy. After that, I looked forward immensely to his King Kong remake. But on seeing the new Kong, I confess to some disappointment. The movie works well if you are not a 1933 KK fan and are uncritical in terms of the action sequences. To set it in the period of the original was a really good (and, I thought, brave) choice - but having done that, Jackson then chooses to follow the lines of the De Laurentis 1976 remake rather than the original. Unlike the original (and as in the 1976 version), the natives completely disappear after the first (scarily well done) encounter! Why? Gone are the later scenes of Kong attacking the native encampment, gone are the scenes of natives being stomped underfoot, gone are the scenes of heads bitten off. The 1976 approach is also followed in the relationship between Anne and Kong - in the original, Anne remains petrified of Kong (to great effect) throughout the whole movie (and, of course, she would be wouldn't she?); here (as in the '76 remake), there is a (much less effective) rapport between beauty and the beast.In an interview on Australian TV, Jackson stated that he wanted to make Kong as ""real as possible"". Unfortunately, in places it is anything but! As an example, the famous log scene from the original is remade well to a degree, but in the original people fell to their deaths and stayed dead. The supposedly lost spider sequence is resurrected here but spoiled because it is difficult to believe that the survivors of the fall are not only alive (they must have fallen 30 - 40 metres!) but uninjured (here my suspension of disbelief - rather necessary for a movie of this nature - is shattered!). On top of this, I am expected to believe that a machine gun  can kill a creature attacking (and clinging to) a human without killing (or even scratching) the human - come on! (On a similar note, the dinosaur stampede is not only NOT as ""real as possible"", it's just plain silly.) OK, despite the above, I enjoyed the movie. And yes, I have the first release DVD. I note that there is now an extended edition (perhaps the natives will reappear - but I doubt it!). If it had a 96/24 DTS soundtrack (or even just a DTS surround soundtrack), I might even have bought it! As it is..."	3.0	Great movie, but...	2006-11-19	17	12	5
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A356HRZZFCEGL1	"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos"""	"***This review may contain spoilers.***The more I ponder Peter Jackson's re-interpretation of the classic 1933 movie ""King Kong"", the more convinced I become that he was at least subconsciously paralleling James Cameron's blockbuster ""Titanic"". Like Cameron, Jackson wanted to transcend the basic, naturalistic action and horror aspects of the tale and meticulously explore a relationship that will outlive death and fate. Consider the climax; the airplanes finally succeed in knocking Kong off his Empire State Building pedestal and almost over the edge. He is still clinging by his fingers. He exchanges one last lingering, emotional look with Ann Darrow, then finally lets go. He slowly plummets to the ground. It reminded me of Jack clinging to the driftwood in ""Titanic"", exchanging one last sorrowful look with Rose before letting go and plunging to the bottom of the Atlantic.However, the 2005 version of King Kong (hereafter KK2005) is not strictly a love story. There really isn't any romance, even between Ann and Jack. It is the story of a tortuous, danger-fraught, but ultimately enduring friendship between an unemployed actress and a dinosaur-sized ape. It may remind you a little of ""Gorillas in the Mist"", the movie about naturalist Dian Fossey's relationship with the endangered simians. The 3-hour movie running time may be annoying to some, and sometimes understandably so, but it is utterly necessary to explore the developing interaction between Ann and Kong, and to reveal that Kong is not a legendary demon, but a natural, sentient beast who is the last of his species. Besides, he is strictly a vegetarian (remember him munching on the bamboo?). Make no mistake, Ann certainly fears Kong at first, but her previous hard-scrabble life and talents give her the determination and moxie to take control of the situation. So much so that Kong is even perplexed by her and eventually leaves her, until the dangers of Skull Island, culminating in an attack by three (!) Tyrannosaurus Rexes reunite the duo and give Ann's champion quite a workout!The jungle battles Kong fights on Ann's behalf are more exciting than the perils Carl Denham, Jack Driscoll, and the Venture's sailors encounter on Skull Island because a relationship is at stake and you care about it. In contrast, as when Carl, Jack, and crew encounter the sauropod stampede, and the monstrous insects, spiders, and other arthropods, while as technically accomplished as the T-rex battles, I think the action actually becomes a little bit wearisome and dull because we are less interested in them. We appreciate the time Kong and Ann find to spend together on the island and despair when Carl and company finally chloroform and capture the rampaging ape for transport, and Ann futilely screams to leave him alone.In a departure from the original 1933 movie, and even in the 1976 movie, Ann is not present when Kong is shackled and on display in a New York theater. Protesting Kong's humiliating captivity, Ann instead returns to her acting company. Kong (comically) winces at the phony actress tied up in front of him in a parody of the Skull Island sacrifice of Ann. But of course nothing can sever their friendship; again, Kong breaks free, causes considerable property damage, and somehow (how, exactly?) reunites with Ann. Despite the rampage, I think you feel sorry for Kong, cast loose and alone in a terrifying and wintry neon civilization with only Ann to which to turn. Together again, they manage to enjoy a Central Park interlude and even a sunrise view from the Empire State Building before the military and the biplanes cruelly shatter the magic.Again, many viewers felt KK2005's length hamstrung the movie. I disagree; it gave the movie breathing room to not only develop a deep friendship, but also a rousing exotic adventure, a conservation-minded treatise, some natural horror, a Depression-era time capsule, and the fleshing-out of an archetype. To get the most out of this movie, give it time to let it carry you away and console you with the fact that in spite of everything, Kong and Ann will always have Skull Island and New York.Now for some random (and fanciful) observations:1. The sauropods that Carl and company encounter and eventually cause to stampede do not look like Brontosaurs (Apatosaurs). They look like Camarasaurs with the boxy, deep heads. It was a shame to see such a magnificent herd hurdle off the cliff. By the way, being in the middle of that stampede, it was a miracle none of Denham's party gets trampled.2. As other posters as noted, the rough, brutal way Kong handles Ann as he crashes and fights his way through the island should have turned her into a shapeless mass of protoplasm.3. Again, we have the $64,000 question: after chloroforming Kong, how did Carl and company float Kong to the ship and transport him thousands of miles to New York? I don't think Kong could even fit on or in the ship. Only the 1976 version of King Kong answers that question by hauling him in a colossal oil tanker.4. The Central Park sequence where he plays on the ice pond with Ann is beguiling but doesn't make much sense. Unless the pond were frozen all the way to the bottom, wouldn't Kong's estimated 20 tons have broken through? Also, as a tropical animal, wouldn't the New York winter have been uncomfortable, in spite of his fur?5. If Jackson really wanted to do a homage of ""Titanic"", he should have begun his picture in the present day. For example, he could have had a road crew discover a mysterious, giant skeleton while digging up a street. Archeologists and scientists are baffled, until an aged Ann Darrow arrives and identifies the skeleton as Kong. Then, with tears in her eyes, she begins her sad tale.6. Now that Skull Island is no longer a myth, Carl Denham could have recouped his losses by developing a wildlife park (oh, wait, that's Jurassic Park!)."	5.0	"""Titanic"" Kong"	2011-04-13	0	0	0

Harris ""The Voice of Reason"""	"...and some thoughts on why the 1976 version was in some ways better.This new KING KONG is worth a look but I find it not as overwhelmingly great as to justify all the fawning reviews it has received.The first hour DESPERATELY needs trimming.The interaction between the ape and the girl is very very good. The ape is very expressive. Great animation.Some of the actions setpieces are ridiculously overblown (and run too long). I have no problem with humans running from stampeding brontosauruses and Rexes but they survive far too many close calls and calamities for there to be any real sense of danger anymore. A few close calls would have been fun and exciting, but for there to be close call after close call after close call after close call.....it gets silly real quick. And the suspense and sense of danger is diluted to almost nothing.King Kong runs with the girl in his grasp, drops her and recatches her time and time again. Unless she were made of steel or rubber she would have been squashed like a pea long before it was all over. Didn't even break a rib. What the hell is she made from?Things like that, the elements that s-t-r-e-t-ch-h credibility within the confines of a fantasy film, are the kinds of things that cheapen these movies and make them look like expensive video games.I never got a sense that there was much real love between Ann Darrow and the male lead (Adrian Brody's character). Attraction, sure. But love, no. So when Brody's character goes through hell and high water to rescue her it seems more an act of chivalry than love.Shall I go on? Why not.The bi-planes attacking Kong on the top of the Empire State Building -- that part was pretty cool and well-shot (especially in terms of camera POV and set up, all within the computer, I know). I am deathly afraid of heights and those scenes gave my vertigo a real workout.Ann Darrow/Naomi Watts atop the ESB: In the dead of winter and at that height, she would have been blown off the top of the building by the chilling and powerful winds. Looked like Spring up there in the movie. And though the sunrise looked nice for the scene, the elapsed time of the whole third-act NYC sequence leads us to believe that the great unveiling show at the Times Square theatre must have taken place at about 4 o'clock in the morning.New York scenes: -- other than the crowd in the theatre district, the town looked deserted. Hardly a soul in sight.Skull Island: The first native we see is a little girl. In typical Hollywood fashion, she looks like a very cute young actress wearing ""make me look grimy"" makeup. The Old Lady native is obviously a woman in heavy amounts of ""make me look old"" makeup. That stuff almost always looks fake and calls attention to itself. Couldn't they just find a good senior-age actress?Note how the Skull Island natives just disappear from the movie after they attempt to sacrifice Naomi Watts. Our heroes return to the Natives' area later to trap Kong (no mention of how they got Kong back to NYC on that little boat) but the natives are nowhere to be seen.Notice that in the long and protracted fight with the T-Rexes (or V-Rexes or whatever) Kong sustains several strong bites to his forearms but still muddles through as if nothing happened. But our heroes shoot a relatively tiny harpoon into his leg and Kong is pretty much disabled. Watch Kong almost fall down when he takes that harpoon to the leg. It shouldn't have felt like much more than a needle stick to him. Sure, they used some chloroform on him too but it was a negligible amount meant for incapaciting animals about a tenth of Kong's size.The fact that the Skull Island wildlife is at such odds with each other while our heroes are on the island invalidates the possiblitiy that those species' populations could have co-existed for so many thousands or millions of years together.I'm sorry, but there is no way in hell ANYONE could have survived that ""bug attack"" sequence, machine guns or no. It all looked like a video game. Did you see how many close-range machine gun hits the bug on Adrien Brody took from a nervous gunner and Brody never got a scratch?I have other beefs too, but suffice it to say that a lot of this movie was overblown video-gaming and I find it VERY hard to believe that so many Film Critics would grade this film so highly and uncritically. This film gets compared to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" a lot, but ""King Kong (2005)"" is succeeding on spiffy visual effects and the patronage of a quality-starved moviegoing public. ""Raiders"" succeeded because it had real fun, real suspense, and a central hero who was in real jeopardy but climbed believably out of it. You never really sense our heroes are in any real jeopardy because the danger sequences are too ridiculously elaborate and overstuffed to be believable or credible (again, within the confines of this obvious fantasy world).This KING KONG suffers from what I call ""George Lucas Sequelitis"" -- the story is nothing but a vehicle for the effects sequences. Given a choice to make between any particular moment's or scene's narrative integrity or to beef up that same moment's or scene's spiffy and elaborate effects, Jackson (like Lucas) chose the latter.This film rates a 3 1/2 stars out of 5 at best. It is a fun movie, but the parts that don't work so well and are transparently thin will not hold up well to repeat viewings, and thus the film's value will not have the same kind of ""legs"".I was 10 years old when Dino DeLaurentis' 1976 version hit the screens and I actually liked that movie a lot, even if I though the Great Ape looked like a human in a suit (which it was) more than an actual ape. But it DID have two very important things going for it: the first was Quality Actors. Watts and Brody are good actors, but they are given rather thin dialogue and we really don't get much characterization beyond the two-dimensional sort. Watts gets a few moments late in the film, but mostly it is ""damsel in distress"" stuff. 1976's Jeff Bridges, Charles Grodin, and Jessica Lange managed to rise above the so-so script and lend some gravitas to their characters.The second thing the 1976 version had that this version flirted with but never nailed was a character like Jeff Bridges' character. He was a scientist who knew that this undertaking was foolish and was the voice of reason and perspective. ""We took away their God. A year from now that place will just be an island full of drunks"", his character said when they had Kong safely aboard the oil tanker headed back to NYC. That is a very important part of that story's mythology and it didn't get addressed properly in this new version. You felt that Bridges' character was the lone source of intelligence in the whole proceedings. In this new version NO ONE fits that bill.""King Kong"" (2005) will make a ton of money, sell a ton of DVDs and video games, and probably win a few technical Oscars. But it is also an overblown and overstretched piece of indulgent filmmaking that is riding a wave of hype and Peter Jackson's post-Rings Trilogy reputation. If you look at the film even somewhat critically (as apparently our nation's trusted movie critics have largely failed to do) you will see that its flaws are large and in great number. In fact, I would venture that the filmmakers were ""too close"" to the project and lost their narrative objectivity because they were having too much fun with the concept. They took the whole thing a bit too far just because they could.From the George Lucas ""How to Make an Expensive yet Disappointing Fantasy Film"" Bible: ""It doesn't have to make sense, it just has to look cool."""	2.0	For the rather undiscriminating filmgoers	2006-04-06	33	25	8

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A11XKY4EIU2KNR	"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist"""	I won't bore the reader with the story of King Kong. We all know what the movie is about. Did King Kong need to be remade? That's debateable. The original movie from 1933 has a charm that no remake could ever hope to acheive. The original movie is considered one of the top 100 American movies ever made and is still studied by film students and armchair directors to this day. I believe Peter Jackson knew this as he is also a big fan of the original. I think his version is more of a salute to Kong rather than a replacement. Purists like myself will always like the original best and I'll bet that Peter does too. But with the dismal 1976 Kong remake and the atrociously bad Kong Lives, perhapes it was time to dust off the old 'Beauty and the Beast' story one more time.Jack Black was a perfect choice to play Carl Denham. Look at the original movie, Carl Denham he was a total ham. The guy had terrible lines that he delivered with amateur deliverance. Jack Black played the ham well, even repeating some of the worst lines from the original Kong movie 'No funny business' and 'he went all sappy' was a tribute to the original to be sure. However I have no idea who's idea it was to change Jack Driscoll from a weatherbeaten first mate to a playright, that was just strange. We all remember the tough hero first mate who saved Ann from Skull Island, not a wimpy writer.The Skull Island natives were the best.... ever. Sure they were cool in the original, but they were no better than the extras from the old Tarzan movies. Now the natives were violent and mysterious. I enjoyed the scenes of the natives killing the visitors, it reminded me so much of scenes from Peter's old movie Dead Alive. It is a style all his own.Skull Island is also the best yet. The longneck stampede over the cliff was incredible and totally blew anything away from the Jurrassic Park movies. This scene was used to replace the scene from the original where the longneck in the swamp tips over the raft and then chases the crew on land. I think purists like me would have rioted if Peter left out the famous and favorite log scene. I think I like the original version better, but the bugs and maneating worms at the bottom of the ravine were incredible.In the original we loved how Kong put Ann in the tree and fought the single T-Rex. Now Kong fights three at once while holding Ann the entire time! Kong himself is an amazing special effects work in himself. He looks nothing like the original, but looks like a huge silverback. The path of destruction he leaves whether in New York or Skull Island is a treat for everyone.OK, now the downside. This movie is a bit long, but that's not really the problem. What Peter did in some scenes just amazed me. He is my favorite director. I admired him back when he made Bad Taste and Meet the Feebles. I was a Peter Jackson fan long before Lord of the Ring nerds had even heard of him. So my question is, what was he thinking with some of these scenes where everything disappears and time seems to stop? When Kong is on a rampage looking for Ann in New York, the cops are cruising everywhere, the army is rolling down the streets, and the mobs of people are running like a kicked over anthill. All of a sudden Kong sees Ann and all is quiet. I mean like there's NOTHING! A vast scene of New York and the only living or moving things are Kong and Ann. Where the hell is everybody and why was that scene so long? C'mon Peter, you made you're point about Kong loving Ann back on the Island, no need to have them alone together again to reestablish it, espescially in a place like New York City.Also the farewell scene I believe could have gone without the long (overly long) sad look of Kong. In the original he picked her up, gave one last look, and was killed. Only taking one airplane with him. Now Kong takes down two planes, but the final shots that kill him take way too long as Kong knows he is dying and tries to say goodbye. Again all is silent, no sounds of airplanes, or alarms, just silence. C'mon Peter we know Beauty killed the Beast, but let's not let the director get all 'sappy'.So final word? Lovers of the original Kong will like it, obviously those who never bothered to watch old movies will think this movie is great and may not even know it's a remake, unless they think the 1976 was the original, and most importantly kids will enjoy it, because the bottom line is, this movie is fun.	4.0	4.5 stars for 21st Century Kong	2006-04-18	4	3	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A22BPC7LRSGSYQ	Joker	"The year was 1933.  A fantastic black-and-white movie called ""King Kong"" was released.  It's one of the great movies of all time.The year was 1976.  A fantastic color remake of ""King Kong"" was released.  It was a huge box office success with a great score by John Barry.  Don't let anybody tell you it wasn't a successful movie and didn't make any money.  Quite the contrary.  Research the facts.  In my case, I didn't even need to research it because I remember how huge King Kong was in 1976.  I saw it in the theater.  It was a box office smash.The year was 2005.  A remake was done of ""King Kong"".  I guess this is a remake of the 1933 movie?  But wait... I guess it was a remake of the 1976 movie as well.  Let me see here.........the 1976 movie just wasn't a success apparently.  Maybe the special effects weren't good enough?  Maybe they weren't good enough to satisfy the CGI and video game-loving young people of today?  Maybe that's it.  Not only that, but the 1933 film must be REALLY inferior in the special effects department, not to mention it's in black and white.  Ouch!  Fewer and fewer people like black and white movies nowadays.  I guess the 1933 and 1976 movies didn't do the job.  So..............We got another remake.  LOADED with CGI effects to please the computer and video game generation.  A CGI King Kong instead of a ""claymation"" (to use the term loosely) Kong from 1933 and a guy in an ape suit from 1976.  With the click of a mouse, we get Kong as he SHOULD look, apparently.Now about this movie.....Kong himself doesn't look scary at all.  The scariest Kong was in the 1976 movie, then the 1933 movie, in my opinion.  Then we see a long, drawn out fight between Kong and THREE dinosaurs.  This fight is so ridiculous, it left me with my jaw on the floor, staring at the TV in disbelief.  That's the key word - disbelief.  This fight is not at all believable.  It seems every few seconds there's a close call where Kong rescues and protects Ann in the nick of time.  Not only that, but he's fighting the dinosaurs with Ann in his hand a lot of the time.  Not only that, but the jumping around, the falls the characters take, etc. is so non-realistic.  This whole fight sequence is just plain over the top and not believable at all.What is Ann made of, anyway?  Kong seems to fling her around like she's a rubber band.  A good example is when he flings her onto his right shoulder.  She doesn't get injured at all as a result of this?  This movie comes off as a video game most of the time.When Kong is on top of the Empire State Building, at one point he jumps up to try to grab one of the biplanes.  I can't imagine that anybody or any thing would do that while on top of the tallest building in New York City and not be concerned about possibly losing their footing and falling.  Another thing - after Kong falls from the top of the Empire State Building, Ann is just standing there like it's nothing to have high winds blowing against her.  I don't know about you, but I would think that the average person would be very concerned about the high winds blowing at them thousands of feet above the ground and the person would likely be hanging on to something for dear life.  Anyway...This movie seems to follow the formula of the 1933 movie mostly.  The 1976 movie, on the other hand, doesn't copy the 1933 original totally.  Instead, some changes were made - some big, some small.  The '76 movie had a little campiness to it, but not too bad.This movie is a loooooonnnnng three hours +.  A full hour could have been cut from it.All in all, I like the 1933 and 1976 movies.  This 2005 movie was an unnecessary remake."	2.0	King Kong -  The Video Game	2010-09-23	10	5	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3SOG111JOMT0J	Jonathan Kaessner	I'm biased when I say this movie was underrated. Peter Jackson, in my mind, surpassed his own paramount in LOTR with King Kong. And yet, because of its length and its dependence on CG effects, this movie was criticized wrongly. This is one of the best films of 2005, if not the most rounded and complete. The story is not only a step up from the original, but it comically nods to the original, once again showing Jackson's love and respect for the 1933 version. So few remakes can capture the audience like the original, but Kong certainly comes close. What people saw in 1933 is probably comparable to this masterpiece that Jackson has created here. Everything is working in this film: the acting, the writing, the music (JAMES NEWTON HOWARD!!), and above all the effects. And not just Kong, which makes the CG Hulk look like a Looney Toon, but everything is so grandiose and marvelous that you can't help but become immersed in the environment. The climactic scene atop the Empire State Building is probably one of the most amazing scenes I have ever viewed on film. It is absolutely beautiful. If I have to concede anything negative about this movie, it's that Jack Black had to utter the final line in the film. If Fay Wray had lived long enough, it would have made the moment flawless. But I digress, since I have yet to find anything negative about the film itself. Peter Jackson previously caught my attention with Lord of the Rings, but with King Kong he showed me that he is not a one-tune director. He is probably one of the best directors in the business right now, since he has the money to make the movies HE wants to make (not the ones WE want him to make. It's an important distinction). Above all, I cannot get over how amazed I was by this film. Truly, it is a masterpiece in the medium, and I pains me to read how viciously some people attack it, without taking the time to truly understand the message. Sometimes filmmakers get caught up in the grandeur of the spectacle. But in Peter Jackson's case, King Kong is a spectacle that defies reality.Buy it. Watch it. Love it.	5.0	FLAWLESS!!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A25CQTB313XDWO	"JON STRICKLAND ""Jon Strickland"""	This remake of King Kong is an excellent motion picture. Leave it to the visionary director, Peter Jackson, to give the beloved, big ape emotional elements. Up front, Kong displays himself as an invincible conqueror; however, in solitude, Kong is pensive and frustrated, communicating to the audience that his version of being at the top is very lonely.Along with the passionate interplay that would connect the movie with the viewer, there is plenty of breathtaking action to keep the audience entertained. Included are great fighting scenes between Kong and prehistoric creatures that exist on the island where he is discovered. Chase scenes are rather manic and are so well graphically choreographed that one can only recall the amazement and wonder of the enhanced DTS visual and sound effects brought forth by Stephen Spielberg when he presented to the world Jurassic Park twelve years ago.As you would expect from a big budget epic movie, the cinematography is great, and the acting is top-notch. Those who have appreciated the likes of Jack Black, Naomi Watts, and Adrien Brody will not be disappointed. Mountainous landscapes are prevalent and the display of the New York City skyline circa early 1930's, especially when Kong is on top of the Empire State Building, is quite remarkable.The screenwriting for this adaptation is also excellent. The movie does get off to a rather slow start, but the pace is adequate for character development, something that I thought was a little off in the nonetheless excellent Chronicles of Narnia.All in all, Lord of the Rings was a difficult act to follow, I'm sure, but Peter Jackson has created yet another directorial triumph. One might criticize the so-called highly publicized fluff, namely, the big budget, the enhanced special effects, the top-notch cast, and the name, Peter Jackson, but there is plenty of substance in this classic remake/retelling, unlike some big-budget movies such as Van Helsing.	5.0	FIVE FRESH BANANAS OUT OF FIVE	2005-12-14	23	17	6

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AN1WVL60CQHZ9	Joseph E. Loudon	"Three stars. That's not too bad, right? Unless, you sit down to watch an ""epic"" with five-star expectations. Ultimately, ""King Kong"" is a letdown, not a bad movie by any means, but far from great.Don't blame the leading man. Kong was a remarkable cinematic creation, a truly noble savage. The fault here lies with the filmmaker who got terribly sidetracked on Skull Island, ""F/X'ing"" us silly with dinosaurs, anaconda-sized earthworms and insects bigger than Buicks. Sounds cool enough, until you realize all that screen time devoted to some overly long ""secondary"" action sequences prevented us from getting to spend more time with Kong.Oddly, the entrance of the giant ape was kind of a giant letdown, lacking true tension. In this three hour-plus ""thrill ride,"" there wasn't enough time taken to slow down and really develop much of a Kong mystic. Then, once he appears, not enough ""down time"" was made to -- and this may sound goofy -- develop his character. Peter Jackson had too many other monsters to cram onto the screen.Furthermore, while I found Kong to be believable, I never was sold on Jack Black's portrayal of a devious, obsessive movie director. He seemed to be winking his way through the part, almost too comical to ever be taken seriously.Kong was actually about the most convincing ""actor"" in the whole movie, but because Jackson got so carried away overpopulating Skull Island with other beasts, Kong was almost more of a supporting role rather than a lead. Plus, I can't help but be peeved that Jackson coped out in terms of that instant transition from the island back to New York. Seriously, how - with their relatively tiny ship busted up on the rocks - did our heroes transport the Big Ape to the Big Apple?The climatic scene atop the Empire State building was remarkable, a great movie moment. Unfortunately, too much of the journey to that moment is little more than the stuff and fluff of what ""King Kong"" aspired to be more than, just another hyped-up F/X-packed popcorn movie."	3.0	More Kong Needed	2006-03-17	8	3	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A189COFU9UUX2L	Joseph M. Patane	"Initially, I was a little disappointed in this movie. I have changed my mind as I have seen this now several times and each time I pick up something new I missed. Thus, I enjoy each viewing and my opinion of this movie has improved over time. Though I believe the original movie is better, I still highly recommend buying this movie. There are many parts that were very well done and I feel it well worth the cost of having this version too.I assign a VG to this version of King Kong. (I assigned a VG++ to the original version.)Just the idea of the story - lost island, prehistoric monsters, extensive jungle scenes, ancient ruins and temples, horrendous statues of great antiquity - this is enough to send me desperately searching for that movie or story. Yet plot is important too. Why are the characters there to begin with - are they lost?, searching for somehting? why?In this current version of King Kong, by Peter Jackson, I believe that the casting could have been better. It was ok. Carl Denham in the original movie was basically a good person. He came across as a sincere, energetic movie director, but one who was likely to take too many chances with the safety of the people he worked with. In the Jackson version, he came across as a liar, mean-spirited person, who just used people. I prefer the original Carl Denham.I have mixed feeling about having the supposed writer, Driscol, along. He became the love interest for Ann Darrow, rather than the First Mate, as happens in the original version. This was probably done because it made more sense that Ann would develop a sincere relationship with someone nearer to her work interests, than some sea-going mate, who may or may not hold down a job in the same place where Ann could. So for this reason alone, I think the role was fine. My only complaint is how he gets stuck on this voyage to begin with. Why didn't he go directly to the captain and ask to be let off the ship? According to the original movie, tugs controlled the ship in harbor, releasing once the ship was safely away and able to steer on its own. It is hard for me to imagine Driscol not being able to get back to shore, if he truly wanted to.I initially thoroughly disliked the presence of the guy playing the role of the ""big-time movie star"" being aboard. What made me change my mind is how he eventually becomes a 'hero' of sorts, rather than some dandy who thinks he is a hero and turns into what he really is, a coward. This character development was done just fine, and I sort of liked him at that point. In addition, he provides some laughs and did not take himself seriously either. He earned my respect and I felt he added to the plot.I liked the tramp steamer captain the most of all the characters - Englehorn - from the start. His role was very good. He was consistent, for he maintained the ""ideal"" view of captain in my mind. He was someone to depend upon who would come to your aid, even though you might be foolish with risking your own life and those of everyone else associated with you as Denham did. He had authority, but he did not abuse it. Instead, he used this to help his crew consistently, and helped his passengers, Like Denham, who did not really deserve help.The Ann Darrow part was done very well too. Initially, I did not care for the part in which she dances for King Kong. However, in time I came to accept and enjoy how the relationship evolved. I could not make any suggestion to improve the approach taken to show this development. What I have come to accept is how their relationship does eventually grow, it does become ""interesting"", and that feeling of loss and tragedy that was so poignant in the original was even more present in this film. It was definitely there and I felt that tragic loss of Kong even more in the Jackson version. This is due certainly to the excellent acting of Ann.The build-up of this movie was fine. I enjoyed the ocean voyage, the expectancy of getting to Skull Island grew and developed well with me, but not as strongly as the original film. This was all fine. Then came the islanders themselves - like being stranded on an island with a bunch of evil, drugged idiots. They all looked like they were on crack, stoned on some bingo-juice, and, is short, they appeared more like a bunch of stupid idiots than dangerous natives. I thought this part could have been improved upon. How did these people survive this island, since they all looked diseased, for heaven's sake. Then the wall, yes the wall was dumb. Compared to the original movie, this wall was a sieve that couldn't keep water out, let alone  anything like a charging Kong. This was a big disappointment to the huge build up that occurred to this point of the movie. I did not care for the natives, nor the ""wall"" at all. The original has this beat by far. The overall scenery was great and had more than the eye can take in with one viewing.In addition, the dinosaurs were the biggest disappointment to me. These encounters left a lot to be desired. I did not want a magical Disney tour of a theme park approach as was done in this movie. The stampeding brontosaurs was nonsensical, to say the least. The sailors would have been destroyed by any stampeding brontosaursi as they were all running together down that ""alley"". No way anyone would have survived such an event. This was insane, to put it mildly. Then I ask myself why did they stampede to begin with? It was likely due to the presence of raptors, I guessed from what I observed. Generally, I would have expected the brontosaur to be capable of crushing attacking raptors by using its tail to send one to the moon, stomping on one with it monstrous legs, etc. So the stampede of a herd of massive reptiles in the face of pigmy attackers, as presented in the movie, mountains of massive flesh fleeing from the itty bitty attackers, was far fetched and just not believable to me. And it appeared as if this attack wiped out this branch of dinosaurs on the island since so many fell either off the cliff face or were involed in that massive car-wreck of a mess when machine guns took down the front running dinosaur with the raptors too. I think this could have been a little better done.Then the T-Rex. What a disppointment! In the original version of King Kong, I always wondered what would have happened if Kong met with one of these actual monsters. In the original version, he fought, what appeared to be, a toothless, tired, old T-Rex. What about Kong fighting a 10 ton, charging beast with teeth 8-10 inches long, and having massive jaws capable of ripping many pounds of flesh per bite. This sort of beast attacking him might lead to a different outcome entirely, and this would be enormous interest to this movie, if done properly. I do not think a real Kong could survive such an attack without some terrible wounds of his own. I always felt this would have been one horrendous battle. Something for the ages, to be remembered for all time. Yet this movie turned that battle into a quick down and out joke. Kong made happy meals out of three - yes, 3 - T-Rexes. Impossible! Stupid! Idiotic! I hated that part, even though I watched it with interest. I got bored with it once I saw how quickly Kong was dispatching not one but 3 of the fiercest land predators that ever lived. These beast weighed over 10 tons, for heaven's sake, not a few hundred pounds. Yet Kong tossed them around. Not possible. Then I asked myself, would Kong so easily have dispatched a charging Triceratops? I bet they would have made a comedy of that one too. And again, how about a sabertooth? Such a nightmarish, horrendous predator would have been a challenge to a charging Mastrodon, and I bet could have ripped parts of Kong to pieces, if it ever got onto his back or even got hold of his arm. It would have been impossible for Kong to fight such a creature without shedding some blood too. Yet, I bet this too would have been a one-two punch and out for the producers of this movie. Hence, I lost interest in this entire section with T-Rex.What would I have done? Yes, Kong has to live to end up in New York to finish this film. So he would win the battle, but not before he had some rents and tears in his own hide from the incredibly fast jaws of an attacking T-Rex. It might have been close to a take-down on the part of T-Rex, if I had my way. No way would I have made this battle into a comedy.Then the island itself. What a nightmare world it was. A fascinating, lost world to end all lost world stories. Yet, the island seemed confined, with alleys for the dinosaurs to traverse, not spooky jungles, and it was too mountainous for my tastes. Have mountains, yes, but not dominating the scenery throughout as was done in this movie.In conclusion, I gave this movie a VG, or 4 stars. If the inslanders did not look completely stoned on crack, and if the dinosaurs were truer dinosaurs, and if the battle between Kong and the T-Rex was an epic battle, then this movie would have gotten a higher rating from me. The Original movie, I gave a VG++. It was not beaten by this new version for consistent mood, for keeping my interest intense, for believable acting, and for flow of story."	3.0	Jackson's King Kong -  A very good movie	2006-03-29	2	0	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3GRN6J64F2C3X	Joseph P. Menta, Jr.	"Detailed comments and opinions about Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" abound here on Amazon, so I'll just throw in a few quick observations about the DVD release of the film:1)  Subplots that I felt were needless when I saw the movie in the theater (for instance, the ship captain and the young deckhand frequently discussing Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"") bothered me considerably less during home viewing, maybe because the ability to take breaks while watching the DVD made the length of the movie less of an issue.2)  The few moments of less-than-stellar special effects I remember from my theater experience seemed to magically disappear on DVD (in the dinosaur stampede, for example, the human characters now seem to be perfectly integrated into the action with the stampeding dinosaurs).  Were those few sub-standard special effects ""tweaked"" between the theater and DVD releases, or is it simply a matter of minor effects flaws not being as noticeable on a smaller TV screen?  Whatever is the case, the movie now looks perfect, effects-wise, from beginning to end.3)  On the second disc of the special-edition DVD, I really enjoyed the documentary on 1930's New York.  It wasn't tossed-off filler by any means, but a detailed, PBS-worthy snapshot of a complex, dynamic time and place.There's a lot more I can say about ""King Kong"", the movie and the DVD, but I just wanted to share a few of the stronger impressions I felt upon watching the DVD recently.  I will say that, overall, I think ""King Kong"" is a great movie, and while it doesn't quite approach the triumph of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I can't imagine anyone not at least mildly liking it as a whole while being very impressed with specific portions of it.But that's just me.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for huge battles between a 25-foot ape and a bunch of dinosaurs."	4.0	An impressive film well served on DVD	2006-04-12	3	2	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A34D06JL7LC6MU	"Joshua Miller ""Josh"""	"Academy Award Winning director Peter Jackson (Best Director, 'The Return of the King') follows up his award winning Lord of the Rings series with the big budget remake of the 1930's classic ""King Kong"". Now, I'm a movie buff. I've seen thousands of movies, but have somehow managed to never see King Kong. So, seeing this movie was my first King Kong experience.And frankly, although hobbit-heads will crucify me for saying so, this movie's better than Jackson's Lord of the Rings series. A lot better.The movie's special effects and art direction are absolutely amazing, they're beautiful to look at and at times a bit creepy. The all-star cast is magnificent and then there's Kong, who's ten times better looking (as far effects go, I mean) than Gollum. Oscar nominee Naomi Watts (Best Actress, '21 Grams')plays Ann Darrow, a struggling actress who's theatre has just closed down.Jack Black plays Carl Denham, a movie producer who's film is about to be axed. Oscar winner Adrien Brody (Best Actor, 'The Pianist') plays Jack Driscoll, a playwright who's working on the final draft of the screenplay upon which Carl Denham's film will be based on. As Denham races to the boat he will be boarding to go to Singapore and shoot his film before the studio execs arrest him, he discovers his actress has dropped out of the role.So, he desparately searches for a replacment and finds Ms. Darrow. Loading her onto the boat and creating enough diversions to keep Jack Driscoll stranded on the boat; they're off to Singapore...Sort of. Midway through the ride, Denham reveals that he's actually searching for an island that's not on any map and is thought to not even exist. Skull Island. Well, it does exist andJack, Denham, and Ann; as well as the entire crew of the ship get temporarily stranded on the Island and Ann is kidnapped by the natives who offer her to the extremely large monkey that inhabits the Island. Jack and Denham go search for her, but while Jack actually wants to find her; Denham just wants to shoot his movie. Jack Black, is known for his comedic talent and while this is a ""dramatic"" film; Black is still not in the dramatic role. He plays Denham perfectly and can obviously do drama but still uses sarcasm and comedy for his dialouge. Adrien Brody is capable of being a good action hero and pulls off Jack Driscoll perfectly. And then there's Naomi Watts,who's literally the perfect choice in the role as Ann Darrow, Kong's muse and object of affection. The reason Watts is so good is because she's capable of looking glamourous in 1930's New York and still look like that when she's covered and mud and being saved from a group of T-Rexes. Andy Serkis finds his way into the movie, both as the basis of Kongs facial expressions and as one of the ship's crew members. Anyway, this movie really is spectacular, no question. One of the most entertaining and flat out great looking films of 2005, and at 3 hours and 8 minutes; It better be.GRADE: A"	5.0	Visually Spectacular	2006-04-10	5	4	1

It takes forever to get to Kong and then you will think that he will NEVER leave Skull Island.For those who know King Kong, it will probably be a bummer to watch this.  The back-stories are almost all new and they aren't that interesting.  Adrien Brody, who plays the screenwriter of the movie that is going to be filmed on the expedition, ends up being the macho hero.  The guy is a great actor, but give me a break!A friend said he thought the title should have been ""The Island Time Forgot (featuring Kong).""  The natives are really creepy on the island (nothing wrong with that part), but here is what you have to sit through before Kong is captured:  1. Tons of weeds and trees and bugs.  2. A Brontosaurus stampede that somehow doesn't kill everybody.  3. Lizards trying to eat Ann.  4.  Four T-Rex's fighting Kong forever (Kong wins).  5.  Insects attacking what's left of the group.  6. Bats attacking Kong but staying away from easier prey -- Ann and the writer.Lots of folks die in this version.  LOTS.  There are good things here and there, of course.  I would recommend checking out the movie from the library and then watching 30 minutes every day while you walk on the treadmill.

Paully	It's hard to beat the original since it was fresh and different during it's time, and it even held up as an entertaining movie for several decades.  Although this version is much better than the 80's remake, it doesn't add anything new to the story.  My family and I fast forwarded through a lot of the video and watched it in 1 hour.  Technically it's a well done film, but so are the Star Wars movies.  That isn't enough to make entertainment and I would have liked to see some twists as long as it was a remake of a classic.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AV9SRGPNOD73Z	JR Media Freak	"I am a fan of the original King Kong movie as well as Peter Jackson's theatrical telling of The Lord of the Rings story, I saw this movie opening week and then bought the DVD on the first day available. I felt like I got more than an action movie. On the surface this movie is just action, but it is also a period piece and a love story. On a more intellectual level it delves into man's obsessive compulsive disorder with destruction.The Great Depression in New York is vividly depicted in the opening sequence. This section of the movie shows the desperation that many people had during those difficult times, which draws you into the character of Anne Darrow. She is a struggling actress looking for a big break, and Carl Denham takes advantage of her by promising a wonderful new career in his movie. Denham himself is desperate, because the funding for his masterpiece movie is in jeopardy. He urgently grabs everyone and everything he can to get his movie making passion on a ship bound for a mysterious place where he thinks his dreams will come true.On the ship bound for disaster, Anne Darrow meets her counterpart, Jack Driscoll. She respects his work yet thinks he is just a conceited playwright, but she softens to his romantically interested advances. They appear to have that spark of puppy love that we all have at one time experienced.On Skull Island, we hop on a roller coaster of action starting with savage natives to prehistoric creatures, gigantic insects to the great ape himself. This version of Kong is very real despite his gargantuan size. The mannerisms of a gorilla usually seen in a zoo are perfectly interpreted here by Andy Serkis who played Gollum in The Lord of the Rings. It is easy to fall in love with Kong just as Anne Darrow does, and it becomes hard to hold your emotions back when Kong is captured, brought to the big city for man's entertainment, and eventually destroyed.Carl Denham sets out to make a movie on an uncharted island, but his film and camera are smashed on the rocks of Skull Island along with his dreams. As if taking out his revenge, he feverishly brings down the beast with hopes of showing Kong off as a prize for a price. It is said in the movie that Denham destroys everything he loves, and it comes across as a metaphor for man's natural destructive behavior seen everywhere in this world as we know it. This even more evident when a scene shows one of the ship's crew who is reading a copy of ""Heart of Darkness,"" which not only suggests but foreshadows the natural result when men (Denham) are allowed to operate unchecked: power inevitably corrupts. Denham destroys everything he loves just as they said.I very much enjoyed this movie, and I have been watching my DVD copy again and again. I was impressed with the retelling of this tale with new twists and added character development.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2GM9GNP2G8HO1	J. R. SOUTH	"that's the sound of this clunky, heavy-pawed remake.I was fully expecting to love Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"", despite the fact that literally everyone I know who saw it could not stop mentioning how L-O-N-G it seemed.  Since several of my all-time favorite films clocked in at the over three-hour-mark (""2001"", ""The English Patient"", ""Magnolia""), these warnings didn't faze me in the least.  Now how could I have forgotten my reaction that gargantuan Sominex tablet called ""Lord of the Rings""?  By the time Kong's slender plot had crawled its way to the Skull Island scenes, all of which went on f-o-r-e-v-e-r, my brain had gone completely numb.A big part of the problem is the acting, which ranges from  okay (Naomi Watts), to boring (Adrian Brody, as fascinating as watching paint dry), to the just plain dreadful Jack Black, who has mastered one of Nicholson's puzzled sneers which he uses continuously.  How did these people get cast?  What was Jackson instructing them to do?  I didn't believe or care about any one of them.  In fact, the best actor in the movie is the giant, computer-generated monkey.  Without characters that inspire our understanding, interest or empathy, and without any intelligent attempt to tell a story logically, all there is to sustain the audience's involvement are the endless special effects, which are so interminably focused-on that even they become snoozers and start to appear phony.In my opinion, all movemakers should be required to take and pass a course called ""Alfred Hitchcock 101"" before producers give them a dollar.  Now there was a director who knew how to tell a story, create suspense, and how much to show and to NOT show the viewer!  And despite his reported disdain for actors, even the worst people in a Hitchcock film could plow over the pathetic performers in ""King Kong"".Bad, bad monkey!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A19SF6BLS3SRAK	J. Shifrin	Ironically, after seeing the new remake of King Kong, I instead reviewed the 1976 remake, a film I loved when I was eleven, but I have changed my mind about since seeing it on TV the other day.As for the new 2005 version, much of this film was so spectacular, that I find myself overlooking much of what I disliked about the film.Unfortunately, if Peter Jackson had employed a better team of writers (and left himself out of the writing process altogether) and hadn't decided to cater to the masses who spend all of their down time playing with video games, the movie would have been consistently excellent and not so difficult to review.From an emotional aspect, I was back to being eleven years old, and walked out of the theater feeling extremely satisfied and saddened by the big gorilla's demise, even though I saw it coming thirty-five years ago.As a 40-year old native New Yorker with an affinity towards the 1920s and 1930s, I was blown away by the recreation of New York City during the height of the depression, and was fully convinced that this was New York as it was. I was equally impressed with the costumes worn by the cast members, particularly those worn by Naomi Watts who looked positively sensual in her blue bobbed hat, accentuating her beautiful blue eyes.The ship voyage to Skull Island was harrowing and left me at the edge of my seat. And as opposed to the typical African-like natives that greet the ship's crew on the island, they are instead attacked by a zombie-like tribe that are merely primitive and devoid of any national origin which works quite well and were far more terrifying than anything I've seen in any horror movie, and far scarier than Kong himself.The dinosaur sequences were exciting, if not more than a little on the Jurassic Park side, but were also over the top and cartoon-like as most of the cast members survived running for their lives from a herd of brontosauruses.And the scenes of Kong's return to New York where he ultimately suffers his fate on top of the Empire State Building were simply spectacular and emotionally charged.So, what didn't I like about the new King Kong? Like I said in the beginning: some awful writing. Many of the characters are uninteresting and the relationships between some of the minor ones came across as false. Also, Jackson and his crew of writer's attempts at humor were off-putting and dumb, and not cute and witty as they were obviously shooting for. In fact, the movie then takes a quick turn when the crew reaches Skull Island where things grow dark and helpless, and you feel as if you're in another movie altogether.I really had to suspend my disbelief at how Naomi Watts survived the jungle as Kong juggled her from hand to hairy hand while wrestling a number of dinosaurs.Lastly, the filmmaker completely skips over how a twenty-five foot gorilla was transferred from his homeland on a skimpy sea ship that barely got the crew to the island alive, and back to New York City.Perhaps, if Peter Jackson hadn't realized King Kong through the beguiling eyes of a child, King Kong would have been perfect, and after a 72-year try at the big ape by numerous filmmakers, based on the amount of money that was spent and the talent that was employed, this film should have been great.Nonetheless, one must give credit where credit is due. Everyone at hand, from the director to the actors to the special effects artists on poured their hearts and souls into this childhood fantasy, and I must admit when the film is transferred to DVD, regardless of my criticisms, I will be one of the first to own it.	3.0	Jeff Scott	2005-12-30	6	4	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A28GCEHD00JFZG	Julian Kennedy	"King Kong: 8 out of 10: Peter Jackson's Kong is a long love letter to the original movie that surprisingly turns into that rarest of crowd pleasers. A movie that both men and their gals will like. Like Titanic, Kong has enough action to keep boys of all ages happy and a romance (complete with tragic ending) to get the ladies crying.And what a romance. Kong and Naomi Watts light up the screen with that most famous of dysfunctional cross species parings. And while you may be mumbling Stockholm Syndrome at the beginning (Not to mention whiplash, jeez Jackson turn down the rag doll physics on the Naomi Watts CGI effect. The way Kong flings her around she should end the film in a body cast) the romance seems to win even the cynics (yours truly) at the end.The rest of the cast is also top notch with Jack Black playing an Orson Wells style director so well it is almost freighting. Speaking of frightening many people wondered aloud how Jackson would handle the racist caricature (by today standards) of the island natives especially considering the whole disturbing white wizard versus the ""dark forces"" subtext of the LOTR films. Not to worry the embarrassing stereotypes of happy dancing black people are mocked in the Kong stage show putting that embarrassing Hollywood episode to rest.Instead the residents of Skull Island are some of the scariest people ever put on film. Pushing the PG-13 rating to the limit they put the can back in cannibal. It's nice to see natives bashing skulls, going into voodoo trances and kidnapping white woman they invoke the much happier stereotype of the true island savage. Hell they are scarier than the ape.Possible racial insensitivity aside Kong is far from perfect. While the special effects are overall top notch there are seams. For example when people run with the dinosaurs the limit of the green screen seems to show through (And could we get a moratorium on velociraptors in movies. They are really getting clich&eacute; and being a relatively new paleontological find really don't fit in a thirties era Kong movie. Yes I know that isn't logical but they kind of seem modern as if a character had a cell phone).The other real problem is length. This feels like the directors cut. With an easy 30 minutes of film that could (and probably should) end up on the cutting room floor. We spend so much time in various Kong free Broadway theaters one might mistake this for a Yankee Doodle Dandy remake. All that said great action scary islanders and tragic romance make King Kong a winner."	5.0	King Kong... Yankee Doodle Kong	2009-11-21	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AGKAIX7DSNSQW	"justaclone2 ""The Typer"""	"Peter Jackson is probably my second favorite director of all time, George Lucas is in first and Mel Gibson is in third. I never saw King Kong the first film, and from what my mom says, it was annoying. The overall film was good but the girl would not stop screaming. When I learned of King Kong being remade AGAIN, by Peter Jackson I was not that interested, but thanks to all those movie trailers, even though I only saw one trailer, they just make you want to watch the movie.I did not even know much about King Kong except that it was an old movie where there is a huge gorilla, and it stands on top of the Empire State Building. I did not know where he came from or anything else.When I finally got into a King Kong (Peter Jackson) hype, I went out and saw it. I went with my brother and a few other relatives. My cousin asked how long the movie was and I said, ""Three hours."" Most of the people groaned, just because it was so long. When people groan about it being three hours I say, ""Hey, it's a Peter Jackson film, what do you expect."" My friend says that the whole first hour of the film is just a waste of time, I do not know what he is talking about because that first hour is as good as the second and third.I find King Kong divided into three parts. The first hour or so gives you the feeling of what is going on at the present time, and it takes you from the begining to Skull Island. The second hour is all that action on Skull Island, and by the time Kong is captured you will feel like the movie is over but there is still the final hour where Kong fights for his life running from the army and the air force, which is the third hour. Since the film is divided into three parts I will put the reviewing to three parts.New York-1933. It is year two of the Great Depression, and the opening scenes will really show you what is going on in such a simple way. I really like the first thing that you see, monkeys. When I saw the monkeys I figured I would hear some narrator talk about how monkey have been around for so many years and blah, blah, blah, but it didn't. The opening music kind of adds some comedy to the situation, a song is playing called, ""I'm sitting on top of the world."" You get to learn two of the main characters really quick. The Kong captive Ann Darrow, and the filmaker Carl Denham. Carl Denahm, a movie director, is about to lose his current film which changed location to an island, or what he calls, ""Singapore."" After the location of the film was changed to ""Singapore"" the producing company decided to kill his film so he runs off with the film stealing from the company. It turns out his leading female actress decided to quit acting in the film because she found out that it was in ""Singapore."" So Carl goes out and finds a starving theater actor by the name of Ann Darrow. Carl hires her and she agrees to go to ""Singapore,"" though she does not know what ""Singapore"" really is. By the time everyone is on the boat and leaving for ""Singapore,"" we are about a half-hour in, and the next half shows you more characters, and you travel for days. And then you hit it, Skull Island.Part two-Skull Island-If you have seen the first Kong you know what happens to Ann, she gets sacraficed to King Kong or as the natives call it, ""Tori Kong."" And once you see him, after waiting for a whole hour, your eyes widen and think to yourself, ""Woah."" Woah, is right. And for the next hour there is the wild goose chase, you get to see Kong's emotional side, especially in the amazing visuals on his face. You see him wrestle a whole family of V-Rex's, yes V-Rex's, not T, but V. I find that almost every creature on Skull Island is an enhanced version of the ones we see every day. There is the gross bug scene, which I really dislike the slugs, and when I saw it in theater my stomach churned at a characters death just because it was so gross. There is a good amount of comedy on every part of the film too.Part three-Kong's Fate-You should know what happens from here, and Kong's death is really dragged out from this point, but this really makes you wish that they would leave Kong alone. You could possibly be on the verge of tears by the time he gets near death, because he never did anything. And once agian because of the fantastic visuals you can really see how much pain Kong goes through. By the end of the film, if you think back at the begining you might remember a line that fits with the ending and possibly with today's society, Ann Darrow says, ""Good things never last Mr. Denham.""Peter Jackson has created such a masterpiece, that you will love this film from start to finish, this version I hope is better than the first version."	5.0	"Prepare for scary bugs, native people, chest beating, and possibly crying.

I'm glad I did, because it was an incredible spectacle.  I won't go into the plot, it's pretty basic, but I think a good job was done setting up the plot so you could understand why the characters were there, what everyone's motivation was, etc. I thought the scenes where they arrived at Skull Island were incredible, realistic and scary. Some people are noting the fact that Naomi Watt's character, Ann Darrow, was never scratched up or hurt after her many ordeals (something my husband and I also noted), but this is a fantasy adventure, and if you can believe in a 25-foot ape and dinosaurs, why is it a stretch to believe her character was unhurt through everything? It was a smidge long, but I found it enjoyable. Why analyze?	4.0	A good fantasy movie	2005-12-27	1	1	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3DL686B8JEM8A	"JWK ""jwk"""	"Peter Jackson needs to be careful, because he could easily be pigeon-holed into the lengthy, dramatic, overly ambitous director role.  Believe you me, it paid off in spades with the Lord of the Rings movies.  But when taking on a story that's only half as big as Kong himself, the pattern needs to be altered.I'm not saying Jackson's remake-of-a-remake ""King Kong"" is a bad movie, because I honestly don't think it is.  But when the movie came out, it was hailed as an instant classic, the best movie of the year, and possibly the best movie of the 2000's.  That's simply not true either.  It's been quite a long while since the movie came out, has hit the small screen, the anticipation hype has cleared, so we can now take a step back and view the film with a little more objectivity.The movie is basically divided into three parts, neatly compartmentalized by it's three hours.  (Jackson works in three's, remember).  The first hour is an absolute bore.  In the theater, I had trouble understanding the superfluous character developement, but now that it's out on DVD it seems downright unnecessary.  I think I may know where it stems from, though.  When Jackson took on Tolkein's books, the character developement was needed; these were hobbits, dwarfs, elves, AND humans in a fictional world trying to dispose of a powerful, magical ring in the terrifying, evil Mordor.  ""Kong"" is a struggling director, actress, and filmwriter who get on a boat.  ""Make mention of it and move on,"" should have been the rule of the day.  Instead, Jackson draws out absolutely everything.  Most painful of all is how almost nothing happens in that hour.  Yes, it needs to be shown that Ann and Jack start to dig each other, but that shouldn't take an hour.The second hour is the crowning achievement.  We arrive at Skull Island, meet the savage natives, Ann is offered up to an 80 foot tall gorilla, and the crew go in after her.  Still, barring how fantastically realistic Kong looks, nothing much is new or different from the two versions of King Kong available.  But as the crew goes further into ""the last blank spot on the map,"" it becomes apparent WHY Jackson chose to do the film in the first place.  Brontosaurases, Raptors, T-Rexes, and Bugs to boot abound in the fantastic island all so detailed that it harrows up rememberance of Jackson's greatness showcased in the greatest Trilogy of all-time.  That flame of interest and amazement is quickly stomped out after Jack ""rescues"" Ann and the beast is cholorformed and brought back to New York.The fundamental dichotomy between a fantasy island and 1930's New York City is a lot of what kills the fun of the movie.  I understand that NYC has to be realistic and it is.  But Jackson excels when he shows his audience a world that doesn't exist.  Kong escapes from the stage, runs amock, and finally finds Ann.  From here on out, it's everything you think of when someone metions the words ""King Kong,"" and there's a reason.  It's been done before.  He climbs a building, is shot at, and falls to save Ann.  Obviously, the purpose is to show humanities savage side, but as Kong is crushing cars, destroying buildings, and killing hundreds of people, the viewer wonders what else could humans do with an unstoppable, building-tall animal that kills his friends.The movie is good.  But not Lord of the Rings good.  I understand that it's apples and oranges, but it had the POTENTIAL to be a great movie.  But as the minute marker runs past three hours, one wonders how much of the first and last hour could have been condensed.Overall:  6 out of 10."	3.0	"""It was movie length killed the Beast""  ***"	2006-08-09	10	5	5
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ALLJT7S5QOFFZ	kaduzy	"I went into this movie expecting to love it.  I had never seen a movie get such high praise and great reviews.  I had such high anticipation.  I even tried to MAKE myself like it as I sat there for three interminable hours, remembering how much I loved all 21 hours I spent watching every edition of Lord of the Rings, and how back then I was ready to dub Peter Jackson the new Lord, or King, or whatever title he wanted, of cinema.But it wasn't happening.  Aside from the ape, who is personified beautifully, and Adrien Brody (who is fantastic in everything), there isn't anything really to like about this movie.  It takes over an hour to get to Skull Island and along the way we are introduced to a lot of people we didn't need to meet.  These include ""Jimmy,"" whose name is called in a plaintive way over and over again, the token black character (guess what happens to him?) and a passel of nobodies who have no effect on the outcome of the story.  The digital effects look like a video game at the best of times and like a cartoon at the worst.  Even if the unnecessary 95 minutes were chopped out, this movie would still be spectacularly mediocre.  Assisting it to that end are the dozen or so COMPLETELY ridiculous slow-motion moments that Peter Jackson threw in.  They happen at the worst of times and they look TOTALLY amateurish, as if Peter Jackson let his kids use the video camera and film those segments.  Every single time another one of those moments -- and then ANOTHER ONE!! -- came on-screen, I found myself remembering that Peter Jackson really hasn't directed that many movies.I don't understand what went wrong here.  I am completely baffled as to WHY this movie is so bad.  I'm sure a lot of people will like it, but I have never fled a theater so fast in my life.  The only thing that saved the movie for me was the love story at its core, between Anne Darrow and King Kong.  We're not told anything about her character that makes her worth caring about, but somehow her big melty baby blues connected with Andy Serkis + CGI in a way that sold me, and I actually found myself rooting for the two of them.Or maybe I just needed something to root for to justify my continued presence in the theater.  Either way, I simply cannot bring myself to commend this failed effort.  Kong may be King, but Peter Jackson, in my book, has officially been dethroned."	2.0	Baffling	2005-12-14	28	17	11
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2YN0YLKP8CWAR	"K. A. Hill ""Echter Buchwurm"""	I was really excited when I first saw the preview for this movie.  I love King Kong and adore Peter Jackson.  From the previews I knew that the effects would be fabulous.  When I saw the movie I couldn't believe how disappointing it was.  This movie is the perfect example of how great effects do not make great movies.  EVERYTHING was overdone.  Jack Black isn't my favorite actor, but he was really over the top in this film.  Talk about overacting!  Geesh!  That sort of melodramatic, pompous acting may work in movies like The School of Rock, but it just made him look like a bad actor in this movie.  Secondly, nearly every scene was too long.  It took a full hour just for the cast to get to Skull Island.  Come on!  An hour!  Most of the movie, we are focused on Jack Black's character and not on Kong or the girl.  There was also a throw-in, unrelated relationship between two characters on the boat crew that served absolutely no purpose in the movie, other than to add filler and time.  There were too many excessively long shots with huge insects, dinosaurs and the like that didn't move the story forward in any way.  Don't get me wrong, it was exciting, but only for the first few minutes of the scene.  But the scenes just dragged on and on.  Just when you thought they must be done, here comes another scene with monstrous bugs or dinosaurs.  The sequence where Kong protects Ann from the T-rex was beefed up to include 3 T-rexes and lasted over 20 minutes.  Even the island natives were so feral and overdone that they were entirely unbelievable (and an insult to genuine indigenous peoples all over the globe).  It was completely over the top.  I did enjoy the sequences with Kong and Ann (minus most of the T-rex attack), and New York at the end was OK.  But overall I felt that I lost 3 hours of my life that I will never get back.  I'm really glad that I borrowed this one from the library and didn't have to spend any money to see it.  I wouldn't bother to see it again and will never recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I even gave it 2 stars was because the effects and sound were stellar.  Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody were also wonderful.  Too bad they weren't in more of the movie.  Don't waste your money.	2.0	Royally disappointing	2006-08-22	12	7	5

"Sometimes I find it intimidating writing a review for a blockbuster or super popular movie because I hate to sound like a Hallmark Card and because some people like to hate them only to go against the norm. I was simply so impressed with King Kong that I felt the need to throw my two cents in.I must say that I was prepared for this insanely long movie and I didn't find it dragging at all! I took a quick break in the middle to run to bathroom and grab another beer with boyfriend but the 3 hours flew by! I was sucked into the story and since there was always something insane going on I had no time to be bored, scout's honor!My favorite part was the sweet love story between Ann Darrow ( Watts) and the colossal Ape. I felt the connection this gigantic beast had with her  even though she was human and he was this big strong animal as  they became instant friends who shared naps and laughs. It was very touching watching their friendship develop as a rescue team from the ship had to battle giant bugs, beetles, spiders, dinosaurs and savages to bring her back to safety.I admit, I cried a bit a few times, but I'm a huge sucker for animals and this movie had some sweet tender moments. I was absolutely enchanted by Kong, and his devotion to Ann, as he fought off a few huge T-Rexes and saved her. His had this strong bond with this woman who had no one to love her and she made him laugh by dancing for him and for bringing this sweet look into his eyes. He was more than a killer, he was this sudden soft creature that found her beautiful. I swear I saw his brain working behind all the looks he gave her, and the move did a stupendous job of making him real. I didn't once this that this movie looked like a computer movie because everything looked touchingly real.This movie is a real feast on the eyes as the tight escapes, especially when the crew men had to run from the brachiosauruses and velociraptors on the mountain slopes, I couldn't even believe what I was seeing! I kept saying to my boyfriend ""Can you believe this?? Its insane, this movie is crazy!"" I felt like my wildest jungle fantasy movie scenes were right in front of my face as the movie progressed.Truly a spectacular, yet bit sad but powerful story. King Kong won me over, as this sweet loving giant, who kept reminding us that love and compassion come in all forms."	5.0	Tale of a grand, majestic and magnanamous king of apes	2006-05-13	6	3	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AG65V3LSYO191	Kate	Jaded by the sheer volume of hype surrounding Peter Jackson and this kong-length flick, I very hesitantly went to see this film.Yet, I really was pleasantly suprised and genuinely glad that I saw it on the big screen. The story is handled with deft sincerity, the visuals are spectacular and although long, the work is finely paced so that it never feels drawn out.In particular, Kong is truly wonderful. His emotions are clearly verbalised through his facial movements, his relationship with Anne is beautifully tender and the fight scenes are absolutely gripping. Andy Circus has done an excellent job with Jackson's Kong, and it is he who steals the limelight.That said, there are some minor issues with the work. It has obviously been cheese-afied for the American market, and some of the script rings false. I also grew restless with the slow-action close-up shots of a teary Noami Watts. Similarly, some scenes (particularly on the island) could have been removed to make the length of the film more palatable.Regardless, suprisingly worthwhile for such a mainstream piece.	4.0	Better than expected...	2005-12-18	4	0	4

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	"REVIEW: When Peter Jackson brought his idea of King Kong to the movie studios back in 1996 he was quickly denied it. So, in the mean time he did three small films, you may have heard of them, they were about some ring or something like that. Universal came back to Jackson and said that if he still wanted to do it that he could. The result is one of the most awe inspiring films of all time. It's seriously hard to describe the scope of a film like this version of King Kong. We all know the story, I mean the script is 72 years old. Carl Denham, an eccentric filmmaker, is about to be finished because his producers are fed up with his recent flops. He decides that he's going to make a grand epic by exploring the uncharted and mythical Skull Island. He lures Vaudville actress, Ann Darrow who is reduced to stealing food because she can't find work. Jackson creates the perfect atmosphere of an America during the depression and we get this sense of desperation on both Denham's and Ann's part. On the boat Ann meets Jack Driscoll, her favorite playwright who is writing Denham's screenplay. They find Skull Island unexpectedly in the fog and in an incredible scene the ship tries to maneuver from the jagged rocks of the island wall. Once on shore the characters encounter the natives who kidnap Ann and give her as human sacrifice to Kong, who lives on the other side of a massive wall.Most of the film takes place on the island as the entire group tries to rescue Ann. The island has an atmosphere that is just undescribable. It's absolutely wonderous, and the scale is just immense. The brontosaurus stampede through the canyon is incredible. The visual effects are amazing in the film, and Jackson seamlessly blends visuals with sets to make it work. Later on Kong protects Ann as she tries to escape three Tyrannosauruses. The sequence is breathtaking, and you will watch with your jaw dropped as these giant beasts fight to the death. Another sequence is the spider pit scene, which was not in the original but is reportedly a lost scene. It never made it into the final cut of the 1933 version, but it is here in full glory. The most vile insects imaginable blown up to a huge scale will make you cringe into your seat. Everything is done to the extreme, but not to a point where the audience says ""oh that's impossible, that would never happen"", well maybe it's impossible but it's fantasy, so lighten up. Nothing is too extreme to a point of implausibility. The greatest thing about this version is the emotion, the connection between Kong and Ann that was hard to absorb from the original. We see a connection of two souls, a lonely beast who is the last of his kind, and a women who has been thrown out on the street. It's a love for one another's presence and Jackson handled that with expertise.The film has a shift in tone once we leave Skull Island, and Kong is captured and brought back to New York. We go from this incredible land of mystery to the city where Kong is put on display. Carl Denham has saved himself and thinks he is back on the top, which is all he cares about. Once Kong escapes and rampages through New York City looking for Ann we start an emotional ride all the way to the end. The moment Ann and Kong ascend the Empire State Building you start to anticipate the inevitable end. You watch as Kong basically climbs to his doom just to spend one last sunrise alone with Ann. After a poignant scene at the top there is the shot of the biplanes coming in from behind the building and it sends unnerving chills down your spine. The film's climax is stunning, one of the grandest most iconic scenes of cinematic history recreated through the mind of a master. James Newton Howard's score adds an emotional boost to Peter Jackson's poignant and epic vision. The movie is more than a visual effects romp, it is a truly beautiful story expressed in such a way that it will leave a grand mark on you as a movie goer. This new version has 13 minutes of restored footage, mostly stuff that is a homage to the original like the underwater escape off of the rafts.Jack Black plays the overly eccentric Carl Denham with perfection. His reaction, as he stands in the auditorium after Kong escapes into the city, sends a message that this character has basically brought upon is own demise. Naomi Watts plays her role mostly through screaming and through facial expressions, and she does a fantastic job interacting with a character who was digitally added in later. Andy Serkis did the motion capture for Kong, just as he did the acting for Gollum. His facial expressions and body movements give Kong a human presence, and it helps with the emotional connection of the two characters. Jackson even gave Serkis a side role in the film as Lumpy the cook, which I thought was great too. Adrien Brody plays Jack, who I think never comes to realize the connection Ann has with Kong and he feels distant from the audience as a character.VIDEO: King Kong looks absolutely stunning. This new version is pretty much the same transfer as the previous release. King Kong is a film with some sort of special effect in nearly every shot, so this transfer needs to look great. Color tones are right on the money, black levels are handled well, and the picture is overall incredibly sharp.AUDIO: The sound is again Dolby Digital 5.1, and some are asking ""where is the DTS?"". While this film would have been spectacular with DTS the Dolby Digital is only a hair behind. Simply, the sound is explosive and dynamic. Ambient noise is effectively spread across all channels to envelope you. The canyon stampede is probably the best sounding scene in the film. Don't dwell on the fact that there is no DTS, the Dolby track is very impressive.SPECIAL FEATURES: The special features are spread across all three discs. The first thing you'll find is the great commentary by Peter Jackson, which is incredibly informative and on par with the Lord Of The Rings commentaries. The next thing on the set are the deleted scenes, and there are a whole lot of deleted scenes. The visuals are unfinished, but it's interested to see what was left out of the already 3.5 hour extended edition. Next on disc 1 is the blooper reel, and this is probably one the best blooper reels I've seen on a DVD. It's pretty long and incredibly funny, and it just shows that Jack Black is funny no matter where he is. On disc 1 there is also a hidden featurette that is extremely funny, it's not hard to find at all. Moving on to disc 2 we have the incredible making of documentary. You can watch the whole thing together, or in the separate segments. There is an introduction by Peter Jackson and he explains that nothing here is repeated from the Production Diaries or the previous DVD. There is some really interesting stuff here, and all film students or film buffs need to watch it. The entire filmmaking process is shown in great detail from pre-production to post. There is also a featurette on recreating Skull Island and how the filmmakers wanted it to make it look like the same Skull Island from the original version. There are also a bunch of animated pre-visuals (basically takes the place of storyboards), and a video gallery which shows the concept drawings in montage form. Finally, you can load the third disc into your DVD drive and view the original 1996 script that Jackson cooked up just have it shot down by Universal, then you can compare it with the final version for the 2005 version. An amazing supplement of features is topped off with three trailers.BOTTOM LINE: ""It wasn't the airplanes, it was Beauty killed the beast."" When our generation watches the original King Kong we see a clay gorilla walking on miniature sets. When Peter Jackson watches the original King Kong he sees everything that we see in his film today. Every filmmaker has their one source of inspiration, and King Kong was his. I'm glad he shared it with us. We go to the theater for films like this and even though it is the second remake of this story, Peter Jackson has brought this film a new life and made it his film. It is truly a wonderful, exciting, heartfelt, and touching homage made for modern times."	5.0	An Amazing Accomplishment On Peter Jackson's Part Enjoys Some Added Footage & Some Incredible Special Features	2005-12-18	0	0	0

The ""relationship"" Ann Darrow has to have with the ape is touching, as much as it can be. She is, afterall, totally dependent on him for survival. Many people have wondered what the ape is gonna do with the ""bride"" and clearly to Kong, his brides are his toys, novelties.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A25KZF2MWJWP9A	Keith W. Johnson	The biggest problem most people had with King Kong was its length, so there's no surprise that reaction by the general public to the release of an extended edition of another 3 hour-plus Peter Jackson film was almost the equivalent of a collective groan.The surprise is that everything added to the Extended Edition of King Kong should have never been cut. More dinosaurs and more creatures and more action on Skull Island only improves the film, and one wonders if these scenes were cut mostly for time and pacing, why wasn't a little bit of the 51 minutes of pre-Skull Island snipped or perhaps a few overly drawn scenes of Kong and Anna gazing into each other's eyes?The more noticable scenes are that of a rampaging Ceratops and a fun scene of an underwater monster attacking Adrien Brody and Co. while they are rafting down a river. A bit more character development with some seedy behavior by Carl Denham (Jack Black) and heroic deeds by Jack Driscoll and the shipmates add a bit of flavor to the male characters literally overshadowed by Kong in the film. The spider pit sequence is also a bit lengthened with some more lines by Jack Black. Overall, a worthy 13 minutes of added material, but the film still feels too long in the last act.The special features to this extended edition are the special features that were missing from the first release of the Kong movie, including a commentary from Peter Jackson and extensive behind the scenes features, describing the making of Kong from concept artwork to the screen a la the performance of Andy Serkis.I enjoyed the extended cut, but I don't know that this lengthy movie is better served with added material. It's not like the LOTR films where the additions enhance your viewing and understanding of Tolkien's world. But hey, I am not going to complain about more dinosaurs and the raft sequence I was disappointed was missing from the original cut.	4.0	Review for 3 Disc Extended Edition	2006-11-14	184	166	18

Here are a few things that lowered the rating for me:1. Many of the action scenes were so quick and bumpy that they made me motion sick.  That certainly didn't help me enjoy the movie.2. I never really connected with King Kong.  They had some times where they were trying to develop that relationship, but I never really connected with him.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1ADFVP7HVCRMJ	Kenneth Of The Shire	"""King Kong"" is not the best overall movie ever made, but it is the best of it's kind in the last 12 years or so.  Not since the origninal ""Jurassic Park"" has a creature feature been so exhilarating, enthralling, and just plan fun.The ""Lord of the Rings"" films have established Peter Jackson as one of the best genre talents in the business.  I believe that it is his love and respect for the material that elevates him over most other genre filmakers.  Jackson has said in interviews that the original ""King Kong"" (1933) was the film that inspired him as a child to become a filmmaker.  That inspiration is evident in this gloriously over-the-top yet emotionally grounded update.In doing the update, Jackson and his crew execute some very interesting character shifts while keeping fairly close to the original narrative.  It's a neat way of paying tribute to a classic while at the same time giving modern audiences something new other than updated visuals to chew on.The most interesting character redux in ""King Kong"" is not, in my opinion, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody).  Oh, to be sure, the new Driscoll is a completely different character on the outside (in the update he's a playwright; in the '33 version he's the crass yet brave first mate), but he's still the main rival to Kong for Ann's attentions. (I won't say ""affections"" because this big ape doesn't get down that way, if you take my meaning.)No, instead, the most fascinating character makeover goes to Jack Black's Carl Denham.  In the '33 version, Robert Armstrong played Denham like the ""Great White Hunter"" only with a movie camera instead of a gun.  His leadership qualities are never called into question and he's never blamed for the mistakes that eventually lead to Kong's death.In the update, Black plays Denham like Orson Welles without the talent, and I must say his performance resonated with me.  I know some folks thought Black a bad choice for Denham, and he would have been had he been forced to emulate Armstrong's interpretation of the character.  But play Denham as an egomaniacal little weasal with a lot of charisma and few if any moral scruples?  For my money, Jack Black hit this one out of the park.  By the end of the film, I wanted to reach through the screen and throttle the arrogant little man, especially when he recites the famous last line.  In the original, there was a sense of truth to the statement, but in the update, it's just another Denham exuse and a way of avoiding responsibility for his actions.  Truly brilliant.Naomi Watts is wonderful as well.  She updates Ann Darrow without seeming too modern.  She does her best to take care of herself but is forced to put herself in the hands of her simian protector.  (Let's face it, Skull Island is not the ideal place to practice female empowerment, or male empowerment for that matter.)  That decision allows for Ann to bond with Kong in a believable way:  their kinship is born of the simple fact that they are the only two creatures on Skull Island who are not trying to kill and eat each other.Is ""Kong"" perfect.  Close, but no.  A couple of the effects shots, (particularly the brontosour stampede) have a rushed, unfinished look to them.  They aren't mind numbingly bad, but in comparison to the rest of WETA's work on the film, mediocrity is going to stand out.  I would have also liked to see how in the holy hell they got Kong back to New York.  (I know, I know, you didn't see it in the '33 version, either, but if you're going to update it, than go all the way.)However, these are minor nitpicks.  The clever in-jokes and references to the first film are an unexpected delight, the visuals are eye-popping, the pacing is excellent, the performances pitch perfect, including a tour-de-force from Andy Serkis as Kong.If you didn't catch it in the theaters because you had seen the earlier film or simply were not interested, I urge you to give Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" a chance.  You will not be disappointed."	5.0	New Kong is a Giddy Masterpiece!	2006-03-24	12	8	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AMS0KR29YZXCE	"Kenneth Sohl ""ksohl@bellsouth.net"""	"As pretentious as it sounds, King Kong is film's answer to ""the Odyssey"", in some way.  There is so much going on here, love, action, fantasy, horror, discovery, the things that plumb our depths where things truly matter with absolutely no cheap, shallow ""social statements"".  Spiritually faithful to the original, Jackson has done an absolutely amazing job here, contrary to what is said by those who just have to contrary.  I just wish he hadn't somewhat cheapend the effect with typical hollywood pc elements (the black guy is way-cool, guns are evil, capitalists are evil, etc.) only to blow his own politics out of the water moments later (in true B-movie fashion, the black guy bites the big one once again; moments after using a machinegun to save his life, the young crew member throws it away in disgust only to be rescued by the big macho movie star swinging on a vine and blasting everything in sight) although to be fair, that last capitalist bit did lend itself to some good moments.  This aspect of the film will probably give it a rather cheap, dated look someday.  However, they can't detract from the overall experience of the movie.  Though we have become accustomed to CGI SFX, the finale on the empire state building is absolutely incredible, and must be seen to be believed.  2 thumbs up."	5.0	Modern Classic	2006-05-17	4	2	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2R1NSIVNNAJW3	Kevin	Let me start by saying that I had not seen the original King Kong, until after seeing Peter Jackson's King Kong.  After watching Peter Jackson's King Kong, I ran out to Best Buy, and picked up the King Kong Collection.  I watched the 1933 version, and was amazed at how much I appreciated BOTH films.  I could certainly see the love that Peter Jackson has for the original film, reflected in his absolutely amazing version.Peter Jackson has taken the original, and really given it depth.  We get a great deal of backstory on the characters, and the first third of this film really delivers on character development.  The film sucks you in, and doesn't let go until the final, heartwrenching climax.  Even though it's over an hour into the film before we actually see Kong, the film does not lack substance.  Once we see Kong, the film kicks into high gear with some of the most insane (in a good way) action sequences ever conceived.  Jackson, and his team, deliver the special effects like you've never seen, yet, they are secondary to the story.Finally, the film moves into New York, where the bond between Kong and Darrow becomes an intense sequence, leading into the best climax I've seen in a film, for quite some time.I purchased the 2-Disc Special Edition without hesitation.  I'm so glad that I did.  I've enjoyed this film several times since bringing it home, and the bonus features are very interesting, and informative.Pick this one up, and enjoy one the greatest films ever created.  It's a must own!	5.0	This is a true classic!	2006-04-09	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A32B206L2SEXRA	"kevin ""jay"""	Peter Jackson strikes gold with this shocking and somewhat violent movie.Much in the tradition of the 1930's and 1970's versions,the film covers an eager filmmaker named Carl Denham looking for a girl to play a role in his latest movie.Soon,he runs into Ann Darrow,a homeless and out-of-work actress,and convinces her to come with him and his crew to a deserted island where the film is to be shot.After some slight boat trouble,the crew and cast crash-land on the island,where they are attacked by a tribe of savage villagers.Narrowly escaping,the natives steal Ann and take her back to the island.Soon,Carl,his friend Jack,and others cover ground on the island looking for her.They witness her being captured by a large monkey creature who takes her deep into the jungle.From there,the group encounters dinosaurs,giant insects,and killer monsters.Soon,Carl devises a plan to capture Kong,and convinces the crew to put him to sleep with some chloroform they have stashed on board.Kong is taken to New York and put on display,until he breaks loose,smashing and tearing the Big apple to bits,until a final encounter on the Empire state Building where he is savagely shot down by a number of airplanes.The film covers somewhere near 3 hours,but it's a joyride from start to finish.	5.0	Peter Jackson's most superb movie!	2006-08-18	2	0	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A27P0MW8TE1JQP	Kevin J. Loria	"When I heard that triple Oscar winner Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson was choosing to remake KING KONG as he next endeavor, I cringed. I wondered what another remake could offer the story or theater audiences. Although, on a selfish note, I just want him to get cracking on ""The Hobbit."" But, I wondered, why make a remake when remakes almost always disappoint, look at Mighty Joe Young's remake.  For these reasons, I decided, that I was not interested in seeing a new King Kong movie. But, upon seeing the trailer, then the film, I reevaluated my position....... I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ART, BUT I LIKE IT...scratch that...IT  IS  ART!Setting the movie in the 1930's, like Merian C. Cooper's original, was the right choice, it allows for an instant homage, it creates amazing costuming opportunities (like any period piece) and hedges bets on the story.  The screenwriters can use genre archetypes to their heart's content and it will not be dubbed as clich&eacute;.  But, the plain fact of the matter is that no amount of CGI gloss could have gotten me or mainstream audiences to see a King Kong remake in a modern setting. This movie like it predecessor, is clearly a milestone in greatfilm-making, generating the awe in film audiences I imagine they experience upon seeing Kong in 1933....Good job Mr. Jackson.Jackson re-teams here with his Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, co-writing the screenplay with three-time Oscar winning partner Walsh and their LOTR co-writer, Academy Award winner Boyens. Jackson all reunites with Andy Serkis (who performed the role of the CGI character Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy) provided both on-set performance reference and motion capture performance for the title character of King Kong. Serkis also appears onscreen playing Lumpy the cook, in service aboard the steamer Venture, bound for Skull Island. Serkis' very ""HUMAN"" range of facial expressions are brilliantly matched by the digital talents of the CGI team (I hope they both get Oscars).  Leading lady Naomi Watts, plays leading lady Ann Darrow, to Jack Black's documentary-maker Carl Denham, along with Adrien Brody as the heroic Jack Driscoll.  James Newton Howard (Batman Begins) composed the dynamic, original score for the film. The film is just over 3 hours running time. I guess we'll have to wait for the EXTENDED EDITION to see that missing hour and a half, they don't call him Lord of the Epics, for naught.Oh, the story, right... as if you didn't already know. Okay, while making a movie on Skull Island the crew blunders into the 7th wonder of the world a giant gorilla named King Kong,  they export him to NYC, he ""falls"" for the leading lady and in the great tradition of mega movie-star couples, it ends tragically. `kay. Like the original it isn't reel-to-reel giant ape, there's action, adventure, dinosaurs, and a strange, love-triangleJackson, could have followed his Oscar winning trilogy with his pick of any project at all and the Industry would have bought it. He choose King Kong, because, like Lord of the Rings, it was something he wanted to do, something that meant something to him. Kong like LOTR, was a LABOR OF LOVE, and ....IT SHOWS.THE KING has left the building (the hard way)"	5.0	HAIL to THE KING baby!!!	2005-12-15	6	3	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A30TK6U7DNS82R	Kevin Killian	"The DVD I have in my head is a super extended one with all the scenes Peter Jackson must have filmed and then had to cut out to get the running time under four hours.These are the scenes everyone reports missing, the loose ends that leave you walking out of the theater thinking, well I got my money's worth of spectacle and action and passion and scenery, but what happened to X and Y?  For example, I'm still waiting for the ""reveal"" that would explain where Jamie Bell came from, when Mr. Hayes found him on the boat four years earlier as wild as any animal!  Wouldn't Jimmy, the wild child, have made a good pal for  Kong?  Or was the back story that his mom and dad had been murdered by Kong and that's why he insisted on joining the rescue party--as a way to destroy his nemesis?  On the DVD, we shall see!Same with those natives.  Okay, once they send Ann Darrow on that weird wooden catapult thing to Kong as a human sacrifice they pretty much drop out of the action of the movie, but I wanted them brought back and shown a little human dignity!  I'm not black but if I were, I would be protesting the treatment of racial issues in this movie with both barrels.  Come on, those natives, OK, they were scared of Kong, but were they also possessed by Satan?  They seemed like out=takes from THE EXORCIST part FOUR!  However I expect the extended DVD will clear this up, as well as explain how the tiny crew managed to lug Kong's body back onto the steamer and keep him sedated all the way back to Manhattan.Until then, I'm not too overly concerned with the loose ends.Watts should get the Oscar for she almost makes us believe that her Ann Darrow could actually fall in love with a giant ape.  Like everyone else, I did think her a little callous screaming, ""No, No, save the ape, don't shoot him!"" to the Captain and all the crew who have just busted their asses trying to save her (when they capture Kong).  Show a little gratitude, Ann, it doesn't hurt and it doesn't cost a dime, even in the Depression!  But from the beginning, she is haunted by fate, and she plays it like it was a tragedy, which is appropriate.  Oh, how I wanted her elderly stage friend, ""Manny,"" to come back at the end to shake her hand.  But I guess when he said he was going back to Kansas after their show closed, he meant it.One final thing, the Captain, played by Thomas Kretschman, was th e real hero of the movie in many ways, and yet I can never shake from my mind how horrifyingly sadistic Kretschman was to poor Asia Argento in THE STENDHAL SYNDROME all those years ago when he as young and so ultra handsome!  He is among the best and most arresting actors in the world, good for Jackson for reeling him into the world of KING KONG!  And I'm sure the DVD will have scenes of him enjoying R & R in Manhattan or trawling the waterfront for a new crew and a new supply of chloroform--which, if you know your Argento, you will recall he also used to Asia Argento when he raped her in that strange cave space with the weird paintings all over it."	5.0	Looking Forward to the DVD Extended Version	2005-12-27	4	1	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"""King Kong"" is a good film.  It's one of the better movies to come out in the past year.  It is full of action, romance, and comedy.  It has a solid cast and a nice musical score.  The special effects are very good and the writing keeps the bulk of the story moving at a rather swift pace.With all of that said, I have to admit that there were a few things that I didn't really like.  The beginning of the film, including the introduction of the primary players and the trip to Skull Island, definitely would have benefited from a little more editing.  It's just too long.  Once the crew reaches Skull Island, however, the story picks up to a very nice pace with a couple of comedic and loving interludes between Kong and Ann Darrow to break the pace a bit.  The action is scattered amongst charging brachiosaurs, giant insects and natives.  The stampede scene does seem a bit overdone, but it is very fun to watch.  The battle between Kong and the T-Rexes also seems to suffer a bit from overkill, but it's put together so well that it's enjoyable to watch on the screen.Naomi Watts, Jack Black, and Adrien Brody are all good in this film, but let's face it, Kong is the star.  The CGI gorilla with a big heart is quite impressive on the screen, and his emotions flow smoothly and quickly from anger to hate to sadness and even fear.The outcome of this story is obvious.  Jackson pulls out no magic tricks for the big guy when he climbs that Empire State Building.  The ending is rather moving, but Black's Denham character sort of weakens it.In short, this is a very good action/adventure/romance in the old cliffhanger vein of the 30's and 40's.  It's also very obvious that Peter Jackson loved this film very much and put a lot into its development.  However, much like George Lucas went a little overboard with special effects in Episodes I, II, and III, I think that Jackson is guilty of the same thing here.I should state that the PG-13 rating is primarily for some rather gruesome death scenes on Skull Island.  There is a little language, but watching men get sucked to death by leach-like creatures may not sit well with younger viewers.Recommended to fans of popcorn adventure and, of course, Peter Jackson.  Just don't expect a tale as wonderful as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  This film is sufficient, but don't let people carry you away with talk of awards.  This film may get a nod for music or even special effects, but none of the actors have enough to work with here to gain an Oscar.  Just know that if you like gorillas tearing up the jungle and a sizeable chunk of New York, you'll enjoy this film."	4.0	Excellent Action And Romance	2005-12-19	2	0	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1KT1GWCW8F80	K. Gittins	"I have the original version of the movie which is OK, especially for the time it was made.This version, however, was so full of extended special effects, one after another, that it made this long movie just tedious to watch. Even skipping the first third of the movie, before they get to the island (as recommended by the person who loaned the DVD to us), it still just dragged and dragged. We skipped through some of it to get to the more or less interesting or better parts.So much for ""tedious"" and ""pointless"". Now, the ""unbelievable"".When approaching the island, the boat is in danger of crashing into some rocks (in disregard for safety, the boat is going too fast on a foggy night). When the rocks appear, the captain orders ""stop engines"", and the boat of course continues forward for another 10 seconds and crashes into the rocks, starting another extended special effects scene. You must ""reverse engines"" to slow quickly.There is not much that bothers me more than distorting simple reality. I can accept fictional ideas. However, if a soft and breakable woman is held in a large ape's fist while said ape is running and pounding the ground with his closed hands, and if said ape tosses said woman from hand to hand during his fight with not one, not two, but three T-Rex's, or catching her as she falls 50 feet more than once, and if said woman runs around barefoot on rocks and through the jungle, and if said woman is only wearing essentially a nighty and a smile - you'd think she would at least get a scratch or bruise. Nope.When Kong (and the woman) are on the top of the Empire State building, he is attacked by several aircraft. The pilots apparently have no training, because they approach and fire the forward-facing machine guns, then zoom off. Why not simply circle around the building and allow the rear gunner to shoot continuously? Because...it would be over too quickly and you could not have another 10-minute long extended special effect."	1.0	Tedious, pointless, and yeah, unbelievable	2006-05-19	40	22	18

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	Most audience members might already be aware of the heartbreaking ending of King Kong, but this is also the problem with remakes, as the grand finale falls short of surprise.  With this notion in mind, many viewers might wonder why the prestigious director Peter Jackson desired to remake King Kong, as the movie industry simply would allow him to make anything after the brilliant and financially successful Tolkien trilogy Lord of the Rings.  However, his love for the cinematic art has allowed him to pursue one of his personal favorites and tell the story his own way, a similar way a theater director would give their own interpretation of the play.  In the new King Kong, Jackson's interpretation initially flares out through the extravagant special effects, but as the three hours of adventure has reached its culmination the audience will find themselves emotionally fatigued through an intensely poignant drama.The story focuses on the making of a film on a remote location unknown to the civilized world.  A film director Carl Denham (Jack Black) is adamant about making a film even as the film company attempts to withdraw their funding, as his previous cinematic escapades have lost the film studio an abundance of money.  Despite the producer's attempt to pull the money out of the project, Carl persuades his assistant Preston (Colin Hanks) to help him get the ship away before the producers can stop them.  At the same time they must find a new starlet, as Carl's fiascos have driven people away from him.  Fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, Carl stumbles across Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts).  Ann suffers the brutal aftermath of the Great Depression, as she has just lost her job and has not been paid for weeks.  Carl finds her in a moment when she is considering exploiting her beauty on the stage for food, and Carl offers her the main part in his film.  She takes the part, as her favorite stage writer has written the piece they are about to shoot.  The deceptive plan of Carl succeeds, as he gets everyone he needs out to sea including the writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) that Ann admires.Under the command of Captain Englehorn (Thomas Kretschmann) they set sail towards their own unforeseen doom, as Carl's obsession has lured them away from the safety of civilization.  Onboard the ship rumors begin to spread after one of the sailors eavesdrops on a conversation.  The rumors begin to enhance the tense atmosphere on the ship, as the superstitious seamen fear the worst in their destined goal.  Meanwhile, Ann discovers her infatuation with Jack, which begins to develop.  It is here Jackson truly begins to develop the story after the character introduction in New York before they set their course for Skull Island.  The story builds heavily on emotions with a strong emphasis on love, obsession, and fear.  The borders between these emotions slowly begin to diffuse, as they soon turn into a madman's dream.The ship's arrival to Skull Island soon makes it clear that the cinematic expedition was poorly planned for what they are about to encounter on the island, which is hidden in a dense and mischievous fog.  The most basic emotion emerges within them all - fear - as they discover the secret dangers that have been lurking on the island for the last million years.  Out of fear other emotions begin to brew such as rage, anger, and vengeance, as Ann is kidnapped and brought to the heart of the darkness within the island.  The men on the ship set out on a rescue expedition to discover that some secrets are best unknown, as the most primal of instincts emerges within them all - survival of the fittest.King Kong displays an extraordinary adventure with remarkable visuals that effectively applies computer-generated animation.  These visuals are only the icing on the cake, as the audience begins to cut into the cake they will expose multiple layers that provide a genuine depiction of the primal origin of emotions.  However, Jackson is not content with this notion, as he pushes the audience to investigate the prehistoric emotions that swell up in our civilized society through greed and vanity among other feelings.  Eventually, the film converges on the unifying emotion of love, but where rage and fear exist this tender feeling will rapidly vanish if the individual does not surrender himself or herself to love.  Thus, within this highly engaging epic adventure, the viewer will find himself or herself stumbling into a poignantly expressive tale of unconditional and fearless love resting within all creatures hiding beneath the primal rage protecting the being.	5.0	Amazing Adventure Where Primal Instincts Converge with the Civilized World...	2006-01-16	16	10	6

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2GPEV42IO41CI	Kona	It's the height of the Depression in New York City, and down-on-her-luck actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) accepts movie director Carl Denham's (Jack Black) offer to sail off for an adventure and make a movie.  Playwright/screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) gets stuck on board and they all sail off for Skull Island, a mysterious place that just happens to be the home of bloodthirsty natives, prehistoric animals, and a 25-foot tall ape called Kong.  When the natives kidnap Ann and sacrifice her to the big gorilla, Jack, Carl, and the ship's crew must rescue her.  But rather than eat Ann, Kong falls for her.For me, Jack Black was miscast as Carl Denham; he was much too young and silly. Naomi Watts was quite lovely and convincing as the poor and innocent actress, and Adrien Brody looked like a nerdy playwright, but there was no romantic chemistry between them (probably the fault of the script which emphasizes Action, Action, Action all the time).  The character of Kong is amazingly well done and gains our sympathy immediately, but the depth of his love for Ann is too unbelievable.  With all manner of dinosaurs, giant cockroaches, and city streets full of crashing period autos, the screen is so full of computer-generated images, I actually longed for real scenes.  It's all done superbly, of course, but it just isn't real.  The movie was also too long, but action fans will enjoy it; it's as good as the original, and that's saying a lot. My favorite part of the movie was showing New York in the throes of the Depression; the attention to detail was wonderful.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AELELIC5IDPKN	"Krick ""Aspired Filmmaker"""	"Let me first say that I love this movie and the original. When I was a kid I saw the original on TV and loved the T-Rex fight just like every other kid. Now coming back on this version I have seen this movie more times then I would like to count. I own 3 different copies of it and I have the most recent blu ray release of King Kong.For those of you who don't know King Kong is about a film director, named Carl Denham who is trying to be a successful movie director during the great depression. While in New York he meets a recently laid off actress named Ann Darrow. He conveniences her to come shoot his movie with her as the main character. Another important character is Jack Driscoll, who is the writer of Carl's film and gets dragged along this adventure with Carl. Basically they take a ship and land on a mysterious island named Skull Island home to the mighty King Kong!When it comes to the plot of this movie its a very thick and complex plot. There are many characters you meet besides the very few I mentioned. Many people hate the length and the amount of subplots in this movie. All I have to say is that people have to understand how difficult it is to remake King Kong a third time. When your using a movie that's been used over twice already, you have to come up with new stuff and new ideas. You can't just have the same basic plot. Yes, some of the subplots go no where, but many are important and interesting.The Acting was quite good in this movie too. Naomi Watts did a great job as a beautiful Ann Darrow. Jack Black made a good kind of smart mouthed Carl Denham. Adriend Brody was greatly casted too. Yes Brody is not used to action type movies, but he does portray a play writer. I doubt a play writer would be very good at those types of stunts on Skull Island either. Even the Skull Islanders themselves were great and quite scary looking.The dialogue was decent. There were a few lines I didn't quite understand especially during the love scenes on the venture voyage at the start. I think that is more because of Peter Jackson's non-experience with writing those kinds of scenes.Overall I do enjoy watching this movie. Like I said before I have seen it many times and enjoy it every time. This is one of the movies that sparked my great interest in movies, whether it's collecting them, watching them, reviewing them, or making them.

If you want to read a long review that gives away the movie and all it's plot and subplots, then look for another.Overall I think the movie was entertaining.  I've been thinking about all the unrealistic stuff in this movie, and it dawned on me that it should be a bid far fetched, yet possible.  Some really neet story lines and subplots.  What bothered me the most about this movie was the cheesy lines and drawn out scenes.  It's like Peter Jackson was trying to make some kind of epic by having the drawn out slow moving sceens.  He failed.  This movie is cgi and computer 3d heavy; and this work is high end but not edited so well.  The real kicker for me was at the end.  The most cheesy line of the whole movie: ""The airplanes didn't get him, beauty killed the beast.""  Baaaaad.In conclusion, I would watch it again if I were with a friend that hadn't seen it yet.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A16YHVRP700W1D	"Kristofer C. Ferguson ""The Patriot"""	I saw this movie eight times when it was in theaters and each time i loved it. Of course this movie is nothing to the orignal 1933 King Kong but its a hell of a movie none the less. I was completely blown away by the F/X and the realism of Kong is unlike anything i have ever seen. Granted there were (in my opinion) some things that could have been left out but over all i think the movie is a momumental achivement. Also (personally) i would have casted another person to play Denim because i am not a huge Jack Black fan but i am utterly tounge-tied about this movie and how much i enjoyed it.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	"Batman Begins was good, War of the Worlds was impressive, Revenge of the Sith packed in the audiences but not the excitement, and in movie world it's been a fairly duff year as far as continuing 're-imaginings' and prequel-sequels. Which is where Peter Jackson's  King Kong comes in. At first I didn't really know what to make of this, so few a few days after I was a little ambigous. The computer effects are incredible, and Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts are good. And any film with dinosaurs in it gains another star. But somehow, I was left with an insubstantial feeling, like something hadn't quite clicked. I hadn't watched the 1933 original, so I bought it and watched it after Peter Jackson's version. I know this is controversial, but I think that despite some flaws, the new remake is better than the original.Frankly, I just wasn't that amazed with Merian C Cooper's film. Fay Wray never really connects with Kong, choosing instead to scream all the way to the Empire state building. But what I loved was that T-Rex/Kong fight, and the 2005 remake upps the ante to an almost unbelievable level. Watch out Industrial Light and Magic, Weta Workshop is the new king.Being a New Zealander myself, I can't help but support the films that are made by NZ actors and directors: Russel Crowe, Sam Neil, Anna Paquin, Roger Donaldson, Martin Campbell (Legend of Zorro) However I don't blindy accept and promote everything that comes out of our country (Lord of the Rings had it's flaws, y'know) If King Kong isn't the best film of the year, then it's definitly the best REMAKE of the year. But Kong feels like it could have been directed by anyone, there's no  instantly identifiable mark that says ""Wow! that is so Peter Jackson!"" Regardless, it's great entertainment for the easliy-satisfied audiences worldwide, it boasts some of the best action scenes from any movie EVER, and now everyone can finnaly forget the trashy Dino De Laurentiis remake. A technically amazing adventure but actor-wise, it dosn't quite hit the right notes. When you're reaching for material as lofty as this though, it's always difficult. Si if you're looking for a 5-star action movie, watch it and be blown away, but for something more cerebral, check out Kiwi Roger Donaldson's excellent 'World's Fastest Indian'."	4.0	Not quite King but good fun	2006-01-03	3	1	2

So many long pans over lavish sets as if to say, look at all the effort we went to, instead of trying to tell the story and move it along. Major continuity issues surface at various points to add to the mess.Some stunning visual moments, but in the end I didn't care as I was bored stiff an hour in and realizing more than two were left. Some really B-movie moments, too. Cheesy script and not one exceptional performance add up to snoresville in my book, even if the ape came off the screen and sat beside me.

An amazing film sticks in your head, you remember lines from it and can't wait to see it again.  Is King Kong an amazing film?  I don't know, BUT I do know that King Kong is a great film.  Jack Black is great as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody is solid, and Naomi Watts steals the show.Peter Jackson's direction is fabulous, yes it could have been trimmed a little, BUT I didn't mind that much.One of the things I love about this movie is the epicness, absoulute vastness of it all.  You travel through New York, the jungles, and rivers, of Skull Island.  King Kong is a great big adventure movie and I believe there are far too few movies that can capture your imagination and make your eyes tear up, or make you gasp in awe at the shots.  King Kong is an amazing film.  Its the type of movie that doesn't come along often, a film that makes you laugh, smile, cry, and applaud at the end of it, and that, that is what filmmaking is all about....	5.0	Yes, Beautiful......	2006-09-20	7	2	5

Vitale	I'd looked forward to seeing the remake of this 1933 Classic Movie, but was SORELY DISAPPOINTED with when I watched it DVD yesterday.King Kong was too slow in parts and the slow parts of this movie made it feel six hours long instead of 3 hours long! I think that the filmmakers could have shortened this movie by an hour and had a better film.This movie was way too Hollywood and the overuse of predictable action sequences was very distracting to the movie.The perks of this movie were the story/plot twists that were different from the 1933 King Kong Classic. The acting was great and I was amazed at how realistic the computer animation was in creating King Kong and other creatures on Skull Island.However, I still find the the 1933 King Kong film version to be better than than this one!	2.0	Too Long, Too Hollywood, Too Slow!!	2006-04-10	13	6	7
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"My initial reaction to ""King Kong"" was that it was not as good as I thought it would be, but that might be because the film is 187 minutes long and even though I did not get anything to drink I was rather jumpy the last hour or so.  But then during the mostly silent final scenes when beauty and the beast are reunited I was totally absorbed.  Still, this is a movie that demands the consumption of large amounts of hot buttered popcorn and liquid refreshments and although they have a perfect place for an intermission when we skip from Skull Island back to Manhattan, we do not get a break.  Fortunately ""EW"" gives us several places to make a break for it that I feel I should pass along.  If you are squeamish, then bug out 114 minutes in to film when the horde of insects descends (you have 4 minutes).  If you would rather miss the schmaltz then wait until 139 minutes in while Driscoll watches his play (you have 2 minutes).Okay, the 1933 version of ""King Kong"" is a certifiable classic and director Peter Jackson gets to do a remake because after ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy he has carte blanche for the foreseeable future (compare with whatever happened to James Cameron).  Everybody knows the basic story and obviously the computer generated effects that Jackson has at his disposal are a marked improvement over the stop motion animation of Willis H. O'Brien.  The question is whether the story will be as touching, and that is going to depend more of how Jackson tells the story and how Naomi Watts responds to the Kong that she has to imagine in her mind's eye.The big difference is that this time Ann Darrow cares for the big ape, which changes the dynamic for both her rescue on Skull Island and how she and Kong end up together on top of the Empire State Building.  Beauty still kills the beast in this one, but she also tries to save him.  The final test for this film is quite simple: are there tears in your eyes at the end?  There are other changes as well, the most notable of which is that Jack Black's Carl Denham is more opportunist than adventurer.  Robert Armstrong's character was a producer of his time who sees Kong as just another animal to bring back alive, but Black's character is clearly intended to be judged by our contemporary standards and he really deserves the fate of the Charles Grodin character who was the architect of the trip to Skull Island in the 1976 remake.  Kong might not be the hero of the film, but Denham is clearly the villain and the fact he does not know he is in that role does not forgive his actions.As for the hero in the film, that would be Adrian Brody's Jack Driscoll, who is now a Broadway playwright shanghaied to write the script for Denham's movie.  To put being a hero in context there is also Kyle Chandler's Bruce Baxter, the movie star who is not used to having to play the hero in real life.  But being the hero here means rescuing the damsel in distress only once, and since she did not want to be rescued being saved is not as endearing as it would be.  The script by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Jackson follows up on this by having Denham, Jack and Ann be where they are on the night the 8th Wonder of the World is introduced to a sold out theater.Overall this film sticks to the original screenplay in terms of the narrative action and throws in more dinosaurs, bugs, cars and any other image that a computer can generate.  The only omission that I thought was of consequence was that because Denham is looking for Skull Island rather than what he believes is there this time around, we lose the scene where he directs Ann and gets her to screen at the sight of something too horrible to see.  In the original film that was not only an example of foreshadowing but Fay Wray's scream at that point is important because it is pretty good, but it is nothing compared to what she lets loose when she sees Kong for the first time.  Watts' big scream is pretty good, but it was the elevation in terror that made Wray as important to the original as the special effects with Kong.  Jackson shot the scene, but it was one of several scenes cut.Jackson has included some nice homages to the original in his film.  Fay Wray and Merriam C. Cooper are mentioned by name as Denham tries to find an actress, Watts wears a cloche hat like Wray did in the early restaurant scene, and the costumes of the natives in the original are reprised in Denham's Broadway show along with Max Steiner's original score, which is a telling critique of the 1933's film inherent racism.  You will also see echoes of other films from ""Bambi"" to ""Jurassic Park.""  Rick Baker, the master of make up who played Kong in that ape suit in the 1976 version, is one of the pilots, Jackson is a tail gunner, and if you check out the end credits you will find some other familiar names, even if you do not recognize the faces.  Jackson wanted Fay Wray to be in the film and to deliver the famous final line.  That would certainly have been a lot more than a mere homage and would have qualified as one of the great movie cameos of all time."	5.0	Beauty still kills the beast, but this time she also tries to save him	2005-12-19	6	4	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A26R4A6F24YNSI	Leganto	The 2005 version of King Kong started out great, with a good flavor of New York during the depression. Eventually it gets too long: dinosaurs and people getting killed or injured all over the place, over and over again. And the Empire State Building scenes also drawn out at the end. And why were those guys in the planes shooting at Kong when Ann was up there too in bullet range. Maybe he was such a menace that they had to sacrifice her in order to bring him down? I wonder why I never thought about that when I viewed the original 1933 version.So this new version shows a relationship between Ann and Kong. Cool. They could have cut the film down by at least a half hour and accomplished the same thing. When we watch the extras on other DVDs, we see those good deleted scenes that were taken out because they were dragging out the film or parts of it too long. How come nobody thought about that here?As at least one other reviewer said, I won't be watching this again.	2.0	Good in parts, but too long.	2006-04-09	5	2	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A383PPSVXNB0NB	Leigh Fitzpatrick	Peter Jackson's King Kong is a potentially great movie undone by excess.  Set design, special effects, acting, and overall 'atmosphere' are great.  There are scenes with real power like the one atop the Empire State Building and in Central Park.  But 'the whole' never quite clicked for me because it was too long and too much: too high a gross out quotient; too much improbability (and yes I know this is a movie about a giant ape and a lost island) such as the scene with the humans running amongst stampeding dinosaurs; and too much of a 'let's see if we can top the original movie' mindset like when Kong battling three T-Rexes (what's wrong with battling just one?).

When a film crew arrives on a mysterious island to shoot a movie things get a little out of hand as they soon realize that all is not what it seems in this exotic part of the world...There are slight hints of Tales of the Golden Monkey, Indiana Jones, and Congo, so the movie falls into that type of action/adventure category.Naomi Watts (who at times brings to mind Nicole Kidman), Jack Black, Adrien Brody, Andy Serkis, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING!) allowing for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!The plot, the setting, the special effects, and the music are all EXCELLENT!Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! 4 Stars	5.0	Well Done Peter Jackson!	2006-01-09	5	2	3

She asked me what I thought, and after I thought I came up with these points, both right and wrong.Right:1.  The beginning.  I really enjoyed hanging out in 1930's New York  and getting to know the characters.  ""This is going to be a deep and thoughtful treatment of the King Kong story"" I thought.  That lasted until the infamous dinosaur chase scene.  More on that later.2.  The ending.  I also thoroughly enjoyed Kong's final minutes climing up the Empire State building and his valiant but futile effort to fight off the fighter planes.Wrong:1.  The end of the beginning:  So, all of a sudden this movie that I'm really getting into becomes another stupid stunt-fest starting with a ridiculous and seemingly endless chase scene with humans running along with a stampede of dinosaurs.  Hey, those guys would have been dead in a few seconds.  Wouldn't it have been smarter to stand close to the canyon walls and let the dinos run by?  That's what I would have done.2.  Stunts, stunts, stunts.  Ann ""Gumby"" Darrow gets jerked around enough to put her in a whiplash collar for years but suffers no ill effects.  In fact, we know she doesn't die during the King Kong story so all this putting her in front of snapping T-Rex nasties is a total and laughable waste of time.3.  The beginning of the end:  So, Kong is finally overcome by chloroform and all of a sudden he's on Broadway!  How did they get him on the ship?  I really wanted to see that!4.  If only all that time has been spent on character development and deepening the story!  Or, spend more time on Ms. Darrow and Kong's relationship.  I didn't need to buy the two-disc special edition because I really don't care to watch all the features on disc two.  I really don't care to see it at all.So, this was a movie that was entertaining for both the right and wrong reasons.  I doubt I'll ever want to see it again.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2C4I09VM52T81	Lisa	The sad thing about this movie is that it was full of wasted potential.  It started out with an intersting lead, and made you want to get to know more about the story, as well as the characters.  Then, we got to the bloody jungle and it all went downhill from there.Major plotlines were suddendly dropped.  For instance, what happeneded to the love brewing between Adam Brody and Naiomi Watts?  There chemistry suddenly fell flat. Plus this is a movie which shows how important an editor's job is to the overall movie process.  There is no reason in the world that this movie had to be 3+ hrs long.  None.  Nada.  Zip.  Zero.  I felt every hour of this movie-3 hrs which i will never get back.  And the sad thing was that even I could see places where things could have been cut!  Like for instance, did Kong have to battle, not 1, not 2, but 3 monsters?  One really intense brawl with one of those disgusting creatures would have been great for me.By the end, you cared neither about the story, or the characters.  It's funny, when one would think that the more time spent with a character, the better you get to know them, but after the 3 hrs the only character I truly cared about was the giant monkey, and he went and died at the end, which pretty much sums up what the movie did as well.However, the special effects-if you're into that sort of thing- were AMAZING.  Brilliantly done, it felt as if you were truly there.  However, special effects can't rescue a movie.  The settings were also lovely, and the costumes relating to the time period was gorgeous.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1I9B4PSCDDWOO	"lordhoot ""lordhoot"""	"King Kong proves to be a highly entertaining movie that should make almost anyone who loves movies to sit down and watch it. The movie however, isn't as perfect as one could wish for and there are strengths and weaknesses here. Naomi Watts carried this movie like no other actress. I am not sure if Jack Black and Adrian Brody really fit the types, I thought they were miscast in their roles. I also didn't think it was a good idea to make Carl Denham character so self-centered and without honor as well.On the whole, Peter Jackson's movie is divided into three parts, before Skull Island, Skull Island and New York City.Before Skull Island part consisted mostly of background story, character development and overall, bit too long and dry for a movie of this kind. The main attention should be given to the main four characters of the movie, Carl Denhem, Ann Darrow, Jack Driscoll and the ship's captain but somehow, other minor ""redshirt"" characters were allowed in which dragged out the process bit too long. (""Redshirt"" - ol'Star Trek term for dead men walking and talking.) If any part of the movie should be edited, it should be this part.Skull Island part is the heart and soul of the film. We should praised Peter Jackson highly here since he actually created a real romance story between the blonde and her big ape. The special effects were wonderful and the entire part was highly exciting but what made it work was Naomi Watts' skills as an actress and how well she interacted with what basically was, a computer generated creature play acted by Andy Serkis who once more did a superb job. In some funny way, this entire Skull Island part proves to be one giant romance sequence with other humans and prehistoric monsters getting in the way. You got Naomi Watts playing hard to get and King Kong doing his alpha male bit. I think the key point which was skillfully done was when Naomi Watts confronted by a hungry T-Rex, retreated into the shadow and protection of her ape kidnapper/protector who risked all to fight for her. As a director, Jackson did a superb job getting to that part to make Naomi Watts' conversion very realistic. (Some cynics might call this a bad case of the Stockholm syndrome.)The New York City part basically followed the original 1933 version almost to the letter. King Kong was chained, he escaped, he find Ann Darrow, he escaped to the Empire State Building and there he dies from bullets shot by those pesky biplanes. But the major difference lies in the fact that unlike Fay Wray's character in 1933, Naomi Watts' Ann Darrow actually care for King Kong and understood him as no human could. This sense of empathy and compassion that she had for her one time captor seem to be the core of the movie and what make this movie work so well as not only as action adventure movie but in real sense, a love story between the beauty and the beast.The fact that Peter Jackson was able to create this creditable emotional appeal from a computer generated creature remains a testament to his skill as a storyteller. The move come highly recommended. Its over three hours long but once you get into the second part, its all a very fast roller coaster ride!!"	4.0	King Kong get his girl to care...	2005-12-15	4	2	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1G6NL5AQMZDAC	Ludix	Some thoughts:- It is possible for a movie to have too many dinosaurs. Who would have thought?- Jackson's command of spectacle is immature. He got away with it in the first two LORD OF THE RINGS films because Tolkien's story and characters were so powerful. But cracks of obvious indulgence appeared in RETURN OF THE KING, and they open into a yawning chasm in KONG. (Literally, yawning.) Spielberg fell into the same trap with 1941.- Digital special effects have lost their magic. This isn't entirely Jackson's fault, but KONG makes it painfully obvious. Anything that can be imagined can be now shown. The question is, who has the talent to imagine something fresh and new?	2.0	Overlong, slack and indulgent	2006-03-29	11	5	6
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A21G1HKUQPHFKI	"Luis M. Ramos ""Soundtrack and Film Freak"""	"I remember when I heard that Peter Jackson's next project, after hitting big with The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, was going to be a remake of ""King Kong"".  Quite frankly, I couldn't believe my ears because what else could be made out of the simplest story ever: a giant ape that falls for a blonde...an interpretation of beauty and the beast.  Then I thought to myself that Jackson could create a new vision with the help of the wizards of WETA, and since he wanted to set the story back to the New York of 1933, I couldn't help myself but wonder.  One thing was for sure: this new remake was going to be at least better than the 1976 version.  And God, I wasn't wrong!!In my personal opinion, this happens, hands down, to be the best movie of 2005 (CAUTION: I still haven't seen ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""Munich"".).  In spite of the three-hour length, Peter Jackson presents his view on Kong beyond my expectations.  All the characters are interesting and well-depicted: Naomi Watts' performance as Ann Darrow is fantastic, showing frailty, charm, and strength -all in on one single package.  Adrien Brody is nice as playwright Jack Driscoll.  Jack Black surprisingly demonstrates that he can be more than a comedian, he can be a great actor when he wants it and be on the same level as Bill Murray or Robin Williams.  And it would be very difficult and long for me to describe the rest of the supporting characters because each and every one of them has something to make you care for them.Hell, even Kong has a tremendous personality.  Call me stupid, ridiculous...whatever -I quite frankly don't care.  The magicians at WETA's use of Andy Serkis for Kong's movements is astonishing.  You can laugh at Kong turning his back on Ann after rescuing her from the T-Rexes.  You can be afraid of Kong when he displays his rage.  You can be happy when Kong is happy, specially in that Central Park scene.  And, more importantly, you can feel sorry, pity, or sad when Kong meets his end.  Everything in here is indeed marvelous.Once again, I dare say that ""King Kong"" is a masterpiece of its own.  A great homage to the 1933 original.  This film proves that Peter Jackson may become the George Lucas of the 21st century."	5.0	The Return Of The King...KONG, That Is	2006-01-09	5	2	3

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1YHHM3QFKCBCK	M2	"Now that most of the hype has died down, it's time to look at Peter Jackson's...sorry, make that PETER JACKSON'S...mega remake of ""King Kong"" with a cooly critical eye.  Yes, the ape is terrific.  In fact, Kong delivers the best performance in the film.  But the incredibly bloated, tumultuous three-hour ordeal wrapped around him is an endurance test.  Augmenting the grievously self-indulgent overlength is the problem that it is virtually impossible to get involved in the action or the characters since every art-directed frame of ""King Kong"" screams of artifice, dramatically, technically and stylistically.  As a demo reel for the New Zealand-based special effects shop, it's pretty spectacular.  But as a film, it's a demo reel for a special effects shop. Despite Jackson's off-stated love for the 1933 original, his monkey show has much more in common with the disastrous 1976 remake starring Jessica Lange.  In fact, the Lange version might even be better in some regards.  For instance, Lange's asking the big ape what his astrological sign is in the '76 version plumbs the depths of stupidity far more concisely than the interminable vaudeville dance/juggling/acrobatic number Watts does to try and impress this Kong.  Both are equally ludicrous and make the brave heroine look like an idiot, but the Lange version drops its bricks and moves on, while the Jackson version pounds them into the ground with a slow motion sledge hammer.  Adrian Brody somehow manages to maintain his dignity while everyone around him is slipping on giant banana peels, particularly Jack Black, whose casting as the maniacal producer Denham is as puzzling as it is unsucessful (apparently Pauly Shore wasn't available).  Like Watts, however, Black should receive some credit for managing to stretch one unchanging expression out over the course of a three hour movie (though to be fair, it's hard for an actor to convincingly react to what is going on around them when all of that will be added in later digitally).Two stars for the ape animation, but the rest of film should run on a double feature with ""Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla."""	2.0	The Aperor Has No Clothes	2006-04-05	10	4	6
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AD38IB5NODZX1	M. 9 Fingers	What an interesting re-imaging of the classic film.  This was one of the first Blue-Ray films that I bought for viewing on my player at home, and I was not dissappointed.  If I could level any complaint against this film, it would be the relatively slow start, but if you hang in through the first 40-50 minutes you will be rewarded with some great actioin sequences that are really different and original.  Dinosaurs, giant bugs, chase schenes (you get to watch Jack Black run, which is worth $10 by itself), and the film looks great in Blue-Ray.  I am not always pleased with the Blue-Ray versions of films becuase sometimes there is just a strange and artificial feel to the way items move on screen.  I am not sure how to describe it other than to say that certain objects that should be crisp will blur, and other parts of the screen that you would expect to blur with movement will be crystal clear.  Maybe it's just me, but I found that the HD format for this movie was very well done and I didn't have any issues like I just described.Love it or hate it, this movie is well shot and a visually appealing work.  I am a huge LOTR fan, and I found that this movie has loads of scenes that capture the same kind of epic, wide-angle outdoor scenes that can be really enjoyed even if you mute the TV and just enjoy the visuals even without the distraction of the sound.	5.0	Beautiful special effects and compelling story	2014-03-04	1	0	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	"I have to admit that despite the other lukewarm reviews here, that I really liked this film. This is the sort of movie I go to to basically veg out, enjoy the action and special effects, and forget the real world for a while. I usually don't have high expectations for films like this other than to be entertained for the eight bucks or so of my hard earned dollars that I'm plunking down. The special effects in these action blockbusters are so spectacular these days that the human actors almost play second fiddle to that, and unless the acting is just plain bad, I almost don't notice it anymore in movies like this. But my expectations were far exceeded by this film on both counts.Several writers have commented that the movie doesn't take the original film seriously, or that it looks more like a video game than a real movie (mixing dinosaurs and Jurassic Park, essentially, with the King Kong story), but my response to that is a resounding, so what? If you think of the movie as more in the vein of Jurassic Park and similar fun action movies you'll be more on the money than the viewers who see it as a less than dignified and artistically wanting remake of the much venerated original.I think there's room for both types of flicks--artistically serious as well as non-serious, fun-loving action films that admittedly might not be much more than special effects romps. But they're still the most enjoyable sort of mindless, movie going fun. :-) If I want the other sort, I can always watch ""Citizen Kane"" and boost my movie I.Q. a few points that way.At just under 180 minutes, it's a monster of a film itself worthy of a three-story high gorilla, and in a film that long, there are stretches where nothing much happens, action-wise, which is okay, as long as they don't drag out too far. In this movie, the first third takes place in Depression era New York, during which we're introduced to the main characters and preparations for the expedition are made. But although the film has a long ramp up to where the action finally starts, I can tell you that the rest is worth waiting for.But once the action starts, and at the risk of sounding hackneyed (sometimes the English language fails me, or perhaps I fail the English language), it's nothing less than awesome. The scene where the dinosaurs are stampeded by the raptors along a cliff and then through the jungle is nothing less than awe-inspiring and that's just one of several great action scenes. Once I saw that, I was hooked and was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the movie. And we haven't even gotten to the scene where King Kong is battling the T-Rex--in what has to be the championship fight between the two biggest, baddest heavyweights in history.I'm no expert myself, but I've heard fans of action movies say that the best action movie of all time is the second Aliens movie. I'm not savvy enough about the genre to really say, but I'll put this movie up there with the best of them. And finally, Jack Black turns in possibly his best performance ever and Naomi Watts, who I recently saw in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, where she was great, turns in another fine performance here. Jackson has another winner here and I think the movie is one of the best of the year."	5.0	Long but worth every minute	2006-06-07	16	13	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	"Where do I start? I wanted so much to like Peter Jackson's vision of King Kong. After all, his Lord of the Rings films were staggeringly good, especially in the extended editions.  It's a rare director who can make a film that holds you to your seat for three to four hours. He did it easily. And so when I read that King Kong was going to be nearly one-third longer than its predecessors, I shrugged it off. ""The longer, the better,"" I thought.Boy, was I wrong.This latest--and entirely unnecessary--remake of the classic film fails in almost every way. Its self-indulgence is epic in scope, with the overall feel of a sugar addict starved for a week and released into a swimming pool of vanilla frosting. There's too much of just about everything. Too many slow motion shots with over-the-top looks of longing; too many close ups of Adrian Brody; to many fuzzy-looking brontosaurs; too much juggling; too many cars getting flipped over; and on and on.  Enough already.We only get to Skull Island after what feels like a ten-year voyage on a creaky iron schooner populated by caricatures: the first mate who quotes Conrad (oh brother); the ""kid,"" who is really a thirtysomething guy; the ""Chinaman"" who is a blatant, central-casting stereotype from the 1920's; the stoic Eastern European captain who can't seem to give the right commands; the ""writer"" who is both nerd and ""stud""; and the damsel in distress who poses a lot, and whose eyes change color (you get to notice a lot of detail when you're bored out of your mind).This is a movie filled with visual cliches (the map swept from Jack Black's hands and fluttering out to sea is but one example) that are poorly executed even for cliches. This is a movie that makes the only redeeming character an ape, thus rendering the ending eminently unsatisfying. Our hero dies and all the awful human beings who populate this world live?

So many times, while in the island, one gets the inevitable feeling that you are getting tons and tons of obstacles thrown the way of the characters, in an Indiana Jones-meets-Jurassic Park kind of fashion.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A34SWGCFXDBFPS	"Mario Pacino ""Bill"""	Excellent. Even though it was three hours it was still great. It was more exciting than the original and the first remake. Director Peter Jackson is a smart man for creating the film in the same year and era that the original first came out. If the film had taken place in the twenty first century it would have easily failed. It would have ended up like Godzilla with all the corny dialogue and bad acting. Peter Jackson said his film pays homage to the original but you can tell that he borrowed a few scenes from the first remake. For example: the character Ann Darrow and Kong became friendly with one another and wanted no harm to come to him. The scene in the theater while Kong was chained up a blond woman was tied up on stage right in front of him just like Jessica Lange in the first remake. And in the end when Kong was killed photographers climbed on Kong's body and took pictures up close which happened in the end of the first remake. And Rick Baker who wore the Kong costume in the first remake plays one of the pilots shooting down Kong. Bottom line it was a great film from beginning to end and could have made at least three hundred million or more. Now the DVDs have made that possible making King Kong the biggest selling disc ever. The scene where Ann and Kong are watching the sunset is wonderful. The skating scene in Central Park was very moving and sweet, a classic.

Black's attempts to carry over his nudge-nudge wink-wink arch persona from say, SCHOOL OF ROCK, fall as flat as if trudged upon by the Great Ape himself.  He plays essentially the same character here he always does (which is to say he isn't acting at all, really).  And it's completely misplaced.  And I know this is strictly fantasy, but after all that poor old Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) goes through, you would think she would, at the very least, lose at the very least one of her shoes.  Or something.  Maybe a broken neck or two.  Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS managed to sustain its awesomness over the course of its three lengthy parts; KING KONG has woefully little to be remembered for after the course of its three interminable hours.  It isn't that the acting is particularly poor (but if you don't like Jack Black, avoid as this is actually KING KONG STARRING JACK BLACK).  It isn't that the special effects aren't particularly special.  I guess it's just a matter of overkill and oversaturation.  If you've seen LOTR or JURASSIC PARK or - - heck, the original KING KONG - - this version is just tiresome.  Many of the best scenes happen to be the quietest, actually, as if by accident the film isn't trying to call attention to itself.  Imagine that.	5.0	Who Was That Gorilla, Anyway?	2006-05-08	6	2	4

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO	Mark	Before I get to the part of the review where I praise this film endlessly, using as many adjectives as possible, I should like to point out the single mistake made by Peter Jackson and his crew, a mistake that takes away quite a bit from the movie, especially the end.  It's a mistake that kept King Kong off of my 10 Best of 2005 list.  The rather big mistake is the casting of Jack Black to play Carl Denham.  Granted, this character is supposed to be disliked and greedy, and basically the lowest of all creatures.  But Jack Black can't even take the easiest role in the film and make anything of it.  His lines are said with such little seriousness, that it completely drags the emotion out of some of the scenes in the film.  In the end (I won't spoil it), Black is given a short line, the final line in the film; it's a line of extreme importance to the film, a line that caps off the movie.  Black completely slaughters it.  In the end, I didn't carry out as much of emotion as I was supposed to.Now, with as much of an emphasis that I have placed on this film, you may be wondering how I am still giving this film five stars.  Peter Jackson is the reason this film gets five stars.  Jackson's vision is what made this film brilliant.  Despite his error in casting Jack Black, he completely makes up for it by casting the amazing Naomi Watts (Academy Award Nominee for Best Actress, 2003, 21 Grams).  Watts is radiant as Ann Darrow, and really was born to play this part (pardon the pun from the movie).  I also like the character of Jimmy (played by Jamie Bell) and his discussion of the Heart of Darkness with Hayes (Evan Park).  It really adds to the substance of the film, giving it a great amount of depth.  The tender scenes between Kong (played by the great character actor Andy Serkis) and Ann are brilliant, and they really improve the mood, and the emotion of the outcome.  Adrien Brody didn't really impress me here, although he wasn't bad, either.  No, the show really belongs to Kong and Ann.  Their brief scenes (which are almost always interrupted by humans) are brilliantly shot.  The cinematography is fantastic, and the effects are amazing.Peter Jackson has created a wonderful follow up to 2003's Best Picture Winner The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, and his talent as a filmmaker is astonishing.  Jackson will be forever compared with James Cameron (Titanic) as one of the great epic filmmakers of all time.	5.0	A Piece of Brilliance	2006-03-27	7	6	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A30TW9R3R0NODW	Mark Kittell	"If I had purchased the single-disk version of King Kong, I would have said that despite the stereotypical caricatures of the ""natives"" on Skull Island which were even more offensive than the ones in the original movie, and the unbelievable ""love"" angle between Kong and the blonde, I would have said the movie was enthralling, thrilling and extraordinarily well-made, and left it at that.But, unfortunately, I purchased the special edition, which included a psuedo-documentary on the evolution of Skull Island which would have made Darwin blush. Frankly, we did not need Jackson to inject his thoughts on the ""barbarian"" races of man-the movie's uncommented upon stereotypes were bad enough. Back in the 1930's, the Nazi's established a special research outfit (the Ahnenerbe) to uncover ""Arian"" ancestry to Egyptian, Inca and even Roman civilizations; likewise, Jackson's ""documentary,"" unlike the original movie, states the ""present"" inhabitants on the island were primitive beasts incapable of putting two stones together, let alone build the massive walls around the island. One suspects that Jackson's native prejudices have gotten the best of him (his fellow New Zealander, Jane Campion,  portrayed New Zealand's indigenous people in a similarly unflattering way in her film ""The Piano"").That said, King Kong is very well made movie. It is simply too bad that after viewing the Skull documentary, that in the back of our minds we have to wonder: what was he thinking  while he did this?"	4.0	Great movie, but Jackson should keep his views to himself	2006-04-10	10	1	9

Barrie ""MRBSTAR"""	"As a long time movie buff and historian, I am amused at how far off base Amazon's Mark Englehart and other reviewers can be. It appears to me that many of these reviews were planted to drive up sales. Peter Jackson's version of King Kong is disappointing on many levels as most everyone I have spoken to agrees.Mr Jackson whose exemplary work on the LOTR series is missing here because the script is lacking and suffering from what appears to be heavy editing.  This is supposed to be the classic story of beauty and the beast. Instead, this version is about how many special effects can be crammed into three hours, at the grave expense of story line and character development.  The answer is, a whole lot of special effects!We are supposed to believe that the Adrien Brody character has fallen madly in love with Naomi Watts after only one badly edited scene. The scene cuts away harshly from a romantic kiss to Mr Brody speaking to another character in another time and place.  Based on this one shortened scene, we are supposed to believe that Mr. Brody will risk his life and ultimately climb the empire state building to rescue his true love.  Am I the only one who doesn't buy any of this?The scenes with dinosaurs, bugs and other hideous creatures are too long and way too scary for children, who should have loved this film if not made to be so terrifying.  These elongated and sometimes repulsive scenes were left in apparently instead of any real character development.  Who is the audience Mr. Jackson is targeting here?  Special effects / action freaks only it appears.The biggest let down of all is the relationship of Kong and Naomi Watts, who is an actress of great merit and does her best with what she is given.  Sadly, the majority of what she is given is an angry and violent Kong who is very unlikeable.  The only real scene that shows any tenderness prior to Kong's demise is that of the two watching a beautiful sunset.  In the 1933 version, we feel great empathy toward Kong, but in Jackson's version he is a mean destructive beast who actually eats a man alive. Aren't apes vegetarians?In conclusion, the special effects are tremendous as is the photograghy and sound. If only Mr. Jackson would have remembered to include ""the story"".  When Jack Black utters the classic closing line: ""no, it was beauty who killed the beast"", we just don't buy it.  Unless you are a techno geek interested in special effects, watch this one when is comes on cable and ""don't buy it"". Buy instead the 1933 classic, which remains the only true version of a great story."	2.0	This Version of King Kong is Nothing to go Ape Over	2006-03-31	19	4	15
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1EXS156IQG7OA	Mark R. Whittington	Peter Jackson took a lot of the original material from the 1930s King Kong and ran with it like a broken field football player on a hundred yard run. What he produced was a grand, sprawling mess of a movie that entertained and made one shiver and cry in turn. He masterfully recreates the world of the 1930s, including an art deco New York wallowing in the Depression. The creatures on Skull Island, not the least of which is the twenty five foot ape, are created in all of their horrific splendor. Standout performences include Jack Black, as a smarmy film producer, and Naomi Watts, the beauty who killed the beast. Watts is especially a heart breaker, who can make one believe that she can make anyone or anything fall in love with her, even a giant ape.	5.0	A Grand, Sprawling Mess of a Flick	2005-12-17	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AI5XPE6P5TSMK	"Mark Talmadge ""Anime Nation"""	This review is based on my original viewing of the King Kong DVD and I have to say that while I'm sure that the Blu-ray is gorgeous, I have a problem with Jack Black. The character of Carl Denham should have had a different actor. Jack Black, while I have no reason to doubt that he seems to be a funny comedian, lacks any serious acting skills to pull off this character as being believable.Hollywood continues to remake classic television shows or remake movies like that of King Kong and Godzilla and end up failing to deliver a quality product. The problem is that Hollywood directors like to transform classic properties into a comedy movie and everytime they do this, they always manage to create a piece of crap that fails to give Hollywood any good standing. Starsky and Hutch, Charlie's Angels, Bewitched, Brady Bunch, The Flintstones ... they were all pale imitations, at best. The problem is that King Kong employs a whole cast of serious actors and Jack Black tries so hard to at serious acting that he often falls flat on his face.Robin Williams, Jim Carey ... even George Carlin, all serious and very funny comedians, managed to develop a serious acting side and pulled together some very good dramatic movies and they even succeeded at expanding their talents as serious actors. However, Jack Black needed to showcase this side of his acting ability and he simply fails miserably. Here, he seems to be a round peg trying to fit into a square.The one thing I have to credit is Peter Jackson who producing a very good movie. However, in trying to create a different movie, I think maybe made a bad casting mistake in regards to Jack Black. Two and one half hours was bad enough but now everyone gets to agonize through over three hours of bad acting from Jack Black. I can think of better King Kong movies to watch than his bad acting.	3.0	Kong is Back	2010-03-10	5	1	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1IAQIZSXONWVU	"Mark ""The early bird gets the worm but the se..."	"I just watched King Kong on widescreen dvd.  I really wanted to give Jackson's King Kong 5 stars but can't quite get there from here.  4.5?  The first 30 - 40 minutes are somewhat tiresome (I'm being generous... we get too much detail.  It goes on too long and it's boring).  Once we get to Skull Island things pick up.  Boy do things pickup!  To start with, the indigenous people on Skull (Mordor) Island are downright scary, it's like the Mau Mau Uprising meets Night of the Living Dead.  Disturbing imagery!The Kong ""character"" is incredible as are all the creatures on the island.  His range of emotions is amazing - prediction:  this Kong will never be outdone.  My only problem with Jackson's movie is that the action scenes are so over the top in places that they become laughable.  I actually found myself laughing watching Naomi Watts digital stunt double being thrown around from hand-to-hand like a rag doll during the T-Rex battle.  Can you say whiplash whiplash whiplash whiplash whiplash?  There is no way a human being could survive all that tossing around and then stand up.  Every bone in her body would have been broken.  The scene with the brontosaurus/raptor stampede is fun but it's still way too over the top.  I just couldn't suspend belief THAT far - it went from exciting to ridiculous.In summary.  Great effects, great acting (Naomi Watts manages to pull off caring about Kong without getting corny, as in Jessica Lange's prior take on this character), great cinematography, great directing, great scenes, but the action scenes are just too much in some places and this takes a little away from an otherwise brilliant remake.  Also, this film was at least 30 minutes longer than it needed to be.  I'm reminded of Stephen King's over-indulgence in details details details and books that are a couple of hundred pages longer than they needed to be.Love yer work Peter Jackson.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1DZKOOMMJM1MI	"Mark Twain ""Sam"""	Granted I've never been a fan of Peter Jackson, I still had high hopes for this remake of the 1933 classic. While I loved the original, I thought, with today's technology, and a theatrical trailer that actually looked good, this remake would have been great! And it would have, had it been at least 45 minutes shorter.The film's way too long 3 hour and 15 minute running time kills it, as does Jackson's attempt to humanize the ape. The original had me feeling for Kong, but this one had me disturbed at his relationship with Ann Darrow. Jackson made it seem like the woman was in love with the ape, with lots of romantic moments between them, and a totally unnecessary `love' scene amongst Christmas trees, snow, and an ice skating rink. (BARF!)The original Kong was brutal and no holds barred. This one is the standard Hollywood fare - cheesy, with two many acion sequences and scenes worthy of the cutting room floor.Speaking of unnecessary scenes, I found a good 45 minute chunk that could have been edited out of this thing and would have made the film far superior. Lots of character development that doesn't add anything because it doesn't go anywhere, too many repetitive action sequences that drag on and one and on, and too many lovers moments between beauty and beast.The original King Kong is what made Jackson want to become a filmmaker. You'd think he'd stay away from a Hollywoodized remake and try to stay true to the original. Perhaps he thinks he did, but he definitely didn't. I'm one fan of the original who felt this film could have been so much more.By the 2 hour mark, I was ready for the film to be over, but I knew Kong had yet to be taken from Skull Island to New York. By the end, when Beauty and Beast had their tender lovers moment for the seventh time too many, I was ready to walk out of the theatre. I wish I had. But no, instead I cursed and moaned and waited for the film's nevercoming end.I also feel to need to point out what another reviewer, whose review probably got lost in this massive shuffle, said-1)Naomi Watts is barefoot for the whole time on Skull Island. Yet her feet never hurt, nor get cut up or blistered, no broken toes or bruised soles after running wildly over rugged terrain and sharp rocks in a night gown. Hmm?2) Kong basically handles her like a rag doll for most of the time on the island, yet she suffers no whiplash, sore neck, dislocated joints, etc.3)Though breathtaking, the scene on top of the Empire State building is so ridiculous. I've been up there in winter time, and there's no way Watts doesn't freeze to death in her little flapper girl dress and a pair of pumps. I mean my hand hurt just getting it out of my glove to grab a quick snapshot up there, it was like 18 degrees BEFORE the wind chill factor. Also, the wind gusts atop the tower are unbelieveable. Again, she'd get blown right off the side of the building in those little pumps.This was quite distracting for me as well, and took away from the film. Watts' character should have died within her first five minutes on Skull Island after what she had been through. These moments just made me angry and took away from any enjoyment I could have gotten from the film.I was never a fan of Peter Jackson; now, he's on my Worst Directors List. He seems to be nothing but a big show-off, as my friend so graciously pointed out after the film was over. We agreed that the film takes too long to get started, and too long to get to its end. I might be in the minority here, because the audience was clapping by the end of this. I, however, was thankful it was over.

No doubt she needed years of therapy after the monkey took the dive.The Skull Island sequences of this classic, ""which is not just an adventure film,"" were brilliant, and the overall approach to and reworking of the original film was very successful.  The movie appears to be full of ""insider"" cinephile jokes - especially the Jack Black charachter's send up of Orson Welles (including mugging with a pipe), and the probably deliberate parody of the (equally sappy) death of the character Jack's death as he slips into the ocean at the end of the film ""Titanic.""  Also note some humorous re-use of the original film's dialogue as ""Carl Denham"" shoots scenes from his film.  I suspect that there are many other such hidden jokes in KK.Overall I give this four-and-a-half stars..."	4.0	Great but Smug	2006-05-05	5	0	5
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AXLXU4LMIRO3F	MartialWay	"With ticket prices in California being as ridiculous as they are, and today's movie audiences having completely forsaken manners, it takes a lot to get me into a theater these days. The lure of King Kong, and Peter Jackson's ability as a director was enough to convince me to go. Naturally, I was surrounded by people who didn't give a damn that other people were trying to enjoy the movie, but what else is new? Anyway this is a review of King Kong, not the audience.I won't go into a summary of the plot, there are reviews ahead of mine that already take the time, and I think most people remember the classic storyline of the giant ape on the mysterious island. Of the some sixty reviews posted before mine, only two haters have crawled from under their rocks to post their self-important, irrelevant crap--- because everybody else loved King Kong and they'll rage against anything popular, unlike themselves. So sad... Anyway, only two pathetic haters so far, which I think may be a record for Amazon, and perhaps the internet as a whole.I've read reviews here--- people cried, they screamed--- on the way to the theater the DJ spinning the tunes on the radio mentioned that a girlfriend of hers said the remake of King Kong ""changed her life"". So there were high expectations from the word ""go"". King Kong lived up to all of it, and exceeded my expectations by a lot, though my standard of living hasn't changed.This being a Peter Jackson film, it took its time. The film runs a smidge over three hours, and it does take a while to get legs under it, but once it does the action hardly stops. This island has worse things than Kong, and from the moment our characters set foot on it there are fierce creatures looking to add them to their menu. The least hostile monster on the island is the vegetarian Kong, who is won over by beauty and comedy, and trust me when I say Kong has no shortage of hostility. Naomi Watts' character makes Kong laugh. Judging by his facial expressions and demeanor he is a very lonely and sad giant ape.In spite of being shaken nearly to death like a rag doll in his massive grip, she manages to befriend him. Kong then becomes her protector for the rest of the film. The other characters should be so lucky.What I thought was ironic was that Kong and Adrien Brody's character are both looking out for the girl's safety. Even in New York, you get the sense that Kong is trying to rescue the girl and keep her safe and both the man and the ape pay for their love--- the ape most of all.A sequence of the movie where the men looking for the girl are running among a herd of stampeding Brontosauruses--- stampeding because they are being attacked by hunting raptor-like beasts. People get stomped, and action scenes which always start simply, snowball into worse situations for them. It's not enough that they are dodging the massive feet of giant dinosaurs; when that begins to get stale PJ gives them raptors to deal with, and when that begins to show wear, they are driven to the edge of a cliff, and the ground crumbles beneath them. It gets worse and worse, one damned thing after another.The same goes for Naomi and her new boyfriend. You've seen the trailer. You know Kong fights a T-Rex, but believe me when I tell you, you ain't seen nothing. That little snip from the trailer where Kong grabs the T-rex by the jaws doesn't even come close to preparing you for the battle they have.It was simply awesome. And the poor girl is caught between them, the whole time in grave danger. The monsters want to eat her so badly I'm convinced that she must have smelled wonderful. The men trying to save her has problems too; bigger problems. The most disturbing sequence of the film is when they are attacked by giant insects. I mean talk about the willies. I almost closed my eyes I was so horrified by what I saw.These bugs are utterly convincing as they spring on top of their prey, trying to bite heads, legs--- remember Starship Troopers? Forget it. These bugs are giant versions of real ones. Potato bugs, millipedes, spiders and giant tube wormy looking things that are slimy and disgusting. Are people eaten? No. They are devoured and anyone who watches the National Geographic channel or ""Wild Discovery"" knows how insects eat and can picture in their minds what I'm trying to warn you about. It's like I said before--- on that island they are not safe for one second, and the bugs will be a part I plan on skipping when I own this on dvd. It's horrifying.Seeing everything that Kong has to contend with on this island, and knowing that he too is a survivor of that place--- New York is in deep trouble, but Kong is in bigger trouble. For Kong I imagine New York being the ""lost land"" filled with hostility. There, for all the havoc he causes, he is at the disadvantage, and that's something that wasn't really made clear in the other Kong films. When Kong goes berserk and tears apart the city looking for his girl, I was rooting for him as much as I was rooting for the men on the island trying against the odds to save the her from Kong.The complaints I have about King Kong, is that while I know it was important to show King Kong as sympathetic, a likeable character with a personality, I almost ODed on how sad he is. When he's not fighting monsters, ""awwww look at how sweet he is"". That's fine and dandy, but towards the end I got to thinking ""Okay, we know he's sad and lonely. We know he is a victim as much as he is a menace. Rope it in, and let's see some rampage."" And the rampage was somewhat disappointing. I think they may have taken too much time on the island, and not enough in New York, but that's just my opinion.The movie was intense, with fabulous action. Once you get over the 45 minute hurdle at the beginning you forget how long PJ took to get you there, and you're longing for them to get off that island to safety because it doesn't slow down (except to show us how sad Kong is).King Kong is thrilling, exciting with the right blend of humor, drama and action. Peter Jackson took a classic and made it even more so. Many thanks for reading my worthless opinion and I hope it helped a little."	4.0	A classic remade into a classic	2005-12-16	5	5	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3O2RCKAMSE9X7	Martin Asiner	The original KING KONG has withstood the test of time so that it stands as one of the top 100 films of all time.  The inferior sequel with Jessica Lange was not even good enough to make a ripple in the pool of cinematic greatness.  Now with the third remake, director Peter Jackson has come close to blazing its way as the stuff of legends--close but there remains yet a significant gap between KK I and III.  In this third go-around, Jackson has decided to go the special effects route, which are often so spectacular that by the second half, these effects encroach on the developing bond between Kong and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts).  The battle between Kong and a trio of vicious T-Rexes achieves its Ooh-aah effect.  Further, the gooey attacks of humongous bats and slime worms both repel and attract at the same time.  Yet, even during these eye-popping scenes, I found myself marking time until Ann Darrow resumes her courtship with and of Kong. During those scenes when Kong and Darrow play out their push-pull romance, I could very nearly visualize that if Kong were shrunk to normal human size, then his relation with her would have taken on more of the Beauty Beast syndrome, with Darrow gradually growing more attracted to him.  And that brings me to the function of Jack Driscoll.  In the original he was the romantic lead and was believable enough in his aw-shucks goofy way.  But Adrian Brophy is here seriously miscast as Driscoll. There are more sparks between Kong and Darrow than between Darrow and Driscoll.  And that makes the supposed attraction between Watts and Brophy fall flat.  I also had a problem with the way the natives were portrayed.  Every one of them rolled their eyeballs white as if they were in attendance at some Haitian voodoo festival.  The original inhabitants of Skull Island were models of decorum by comparison.  KING KONG III is a treat for the eyes, but less so for the mind and soul.  I doubt whether I will watch future reruns of KK III with the same fervor that I do the original.  That to me suggests the difference between a good remake and the infinitely more enjoyable original.	3.0	Good--But Does Not Match the One and Only	2005-12-29	4	1	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O	"MartinP ""MartinP"""	"This movie looks like a contest set up by CG animators for CG animators. Let's make it as complicated as possible, they must have said. Let's not have one brontosaur, let's have dozens of them, on a panicked rampage through a narrow gorge. Let's not have Kong fight a single Tyrannosaur, let's have him fight three, not on the ground, but dangling from lianas. And then lets have lots more: giant leeches and giant spiders and giant centipedes, and, and... Unfortunately, the self-confidence of special effects people these days is not supported by the results in this film. The aforementioned brontosaur rampage looks thoroughly artificial and unrealistic, almost abstract: it disintegrates before our eyes. Moreover, special effects by themselves do not make a movie - a message that seems very hard to get through to large budget filmmakers. This is one very disappointing production from the man who made LOTR - he of all directors ought to know how to put digital FX to good use.There are very few redeeming features. Granted, the reconstruction of 1930's NYC is impressive, though in the final part of the movie the set makers apparently weren't sure what season they were in - the sudden Christmas interlude on a frozen pond in snowy Central Park is as incongruous as it is ridiculous. Characters are flat as doormats, and utterly stereotyped. The ship's captain is gruff and taciturn, yet noble and brave; the actress is beautiful and vulnerable, yet plucky; the star actor of heroic roles is a vain coward; and the bookish writer turns out to be the bravest man of them all (and inexplicably sports a physique that suggests many hours in the gym rather than behind a typewriter). Dialogue is painfully predictable (""Scared?"" - ""No; should I be?""). Even the much-praised believability of the love affair between Anna and the Ape seems to be in the eye of the beholder. Personally, I thought Anna's burst of affection for a brutish monster that must have killed hundreds of innocent women in its time, made very little psychological sense.Maybe realism is the wrong thing to look for in a movie with this subject matter. But if you strip away every form of realism, what has the viewer left to relate to?

I don't know how the rest of you feel, but Mister Black has thoroughly overstayed his welcome in the public arena.  I cannot stand him.  I couldn't stand him six years ago.  When will he shuffle on back to his little ""band"" and his core audience of frat boys?2.Naomi Watts' character.  In the original, Ann Darrow wants to get the hell away from Kong.  She wants to see him killed.  But in this version, she loves Kong and doesn't want him killed.  For those of you who think Peter Jackson has tapped into the spirit of the original and that the 1976 version is an aberration, you just consider that.  Jackson's film has far more in common with 1976 than 1933.Then there are minor qualms: Adrian Brody and his nose, the black dude on the ship who says every last line as if he's pissed off, the nonsense about ""The Heart of Darkness,"" the fact that there really was no need for a plot at all: just as with Jurassic Park, I would have enjoyed watching the CGI dinosaurs without the bother of any human characters' presence."	1.0	It's a Piece of Crap, Folks!	2011-02-13	18	5	13

While the original set the standard (also availible here on Amazon), PJ's Kong takes everything to the next level. The SPFX are Oscar-worthy (at the very least), the writing and acting is all rock-solid, and the directing is inspired, as is Jackson's style. The only flaw might be the length, but if you care enough to know about the characters, then the first hour will fly by.The best aspect of the film, aside from one of the best giant monster battles in pop-culture history, is the wonderful relationship between the mighty Kong (Andy Serkis) and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts). The two lost souls find comfort with each other, trying their best to stay together (and alive) against a world that wants to rip them apart.No movie fan's collection will be complete without this dvd!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1VCPMT1RRS7K0	Matt	I don't use that word in normal discourse, but this movie is certainly deserving of it.The effects are simply masterful. Kong is a REAL character, created and brought to life with the magic of CGI. The movements are thoroughly ape-like and Kong is given a unique personality. The imagination that went into this is unreal. The other inhabitants of Skull Island are also extremely impressive. Jackson and crew have created a surreal prehistoric land of mystery and wonder. Truly amazing.The drama is touching, as experienced in the relationship shared by Kong and Ann. There are a few scenes in this movie that are immensely moving, such as when Kong is captured on Skull Island, when Kong discovers ice amidst his chase through the city and, of course, Kong's final stand atop the Empire State Building. You will truly feel for this beast who has been horribly exploited by man. All he wants is to care for and protect Ann and yet because of the greed of man, he now faces impossible odds for his own survival. The final scene is done wonderfully. I mean, you really feel a sense of impending dread as you watch Kong corner himself to be alone with and care for Ann. It's quite tragic.This is a staggering movie achievement.The bonus disc includes hours of material.  There is a featurette concerning the history of Skull Island, a featurette about 1933 New York City and the Post-Production Diaries, covering all areas of post-production of this film.  The making of this epic tale was an amazing undertaking - and it has all been well-documented. The bonus disc provides great supplemental material that is worth seeing.	5.0	Magnificent	2006-03-30	16	14	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A33X3ZY0JFQJ0K	Matthew E. Kenary	"I think Peter Jackson either tried too hard or put too much love into it because at times I feel he is over doing it a bit.  I'm already suspending my belief in reality going into this but I believe at times he is asking too much of the audience.For example, the brontosauruses spook by the raptors scene.  Adrian Brody and pals are dodging in out around the dinosaur's legs while avoiding being eating by raptors. This was fine for about a minute but this scene went on and on, to the point where I was laughing out loud, ""this is ridiculous!"".I got to admit the Kong vs. the T-rex scene was good, but then again Mr. Jackson goes too far. Kong, the girl, and the t-rexes all fall and get stuck in vines and continued fighting, come on now...just end it already.  He kept throwing a large variety of CG animals at us,  bats, tetradactyls, spider things, giant leeches, more giant bug thing, dinosaurs... To me it was an overdose and I couldn't really wait to get off of Skull Island.The ending just left me flat, at I didn't really care, emotionally"" about the empire state building and Kong.  I was exhausted. (Maybe if they shone more people being splatted).Jack Black - not bad, not great eitherAdrian Brody - awful ( not his fault exactly, his character was pointless)Naomi Watts wasn't bad but by the end she was just annoying.King Kong was great, Mr. Jackson can be proud of that.Overall it's worth viewing once, after that go back to the original from the 30's."	3.0	Not Bad but very disappointing	2006-02-18	20	6	14

The second segment is when they arrive on "" Skull "" Island and meet up with savages who look like they are either on drugs or suffer from seizures ( you take your pick ). The third scene is when Donkey Kong is captured and brought to N.Y. Therein these three scenes there are some details that should be mentioned. King Kong really likes this lady and the lady kinda likes this ugly, hairy beast of an animal. She doesn't have good taste I guess. The men are attacked by silly animals and spiders while enroute to saving this lady.  Oh, the special effects were not that special at all. I think they bit off more than they could chew.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AFJCOP0GKZH6C	M. B. Trapp	"I love movies so much that I watch very few of them. The endless stream of worthless trash (and by ""worthless trash"" I am referring both to the quality of the films and their objectionable content) Hollywood spews out is a disgrace to the power and beauty of the medium. In my opinion the fact that box office receipts are slowly sinking is testimony to this. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy is a bright spot in the recent history of cinema. Both a commercial and critical uber-success, Rings brought one of my favorite books of all time to life in a way that I could never have predicted. Jackson follows Rings with King Kong, and while watching this remake of the 1933 original I was reminded of two things, (1) why I like the movies in the first place and (2) why so many other filmmakers are contributing to the silver screen's current malady. I'll try to explain what I mean. While watching Kong - I don't know if it was during the dinosaur stampede or the T-rex fight - I was reminded that one reason I love movies is their ability to transport you into a thrilling new experience that's impossible to have in the routine of daily life. This seems like common sense, but the reason that this thought hit me with such force during these scenes was because I realized how few times that sort of thing had happened to me recently while watching movies. It takes a certain sort of filmmaker to dream up and then implement the kind of viscerally beautiful action scenes that Jackson puts into his movies. Think also of the giant oliphaunts knocking the horsemen of Rohan around like toys during the Battle of Pelennor Fields in Return of the King. Even Revenge of the Sith, with all its technical prowess, didn't have a scene that thrilled like the scene where Kong fights three T-rexes simultaneously, in my humble opinion the greatest fantasy action scene of all time. Other directors just can't do it like Jackson can. I don't know if it's that other directors simply don't have the technical ability to implement such a scene or if it's simply that they don't have the creative vision to dream it up. In one review I read that the character of King Kong is the single greatest visual effect of all time, and I would concur. That's not to say that Kong is without problems. The New York sequence seemed a bit rushed, and whenever a studio writes a blank check to a director, as Universal did with Jackson, the director's ego is bound to get in the way. Jackson could have cut 30, maybe even 45 minutes out of this one and no one would have missed them. The sub-plot between Jimmy and Hayes seemed to be a waste of time with no real resolution, and the spider-pit sequence seemed a bit unnecessary as well. But those foibles I will gladly forgive if the rest of the movie delivers on my overpriced movie ticket. Kong does that, and then some. Jackson is truly one of the great imagineers of cinema, and Kong reminds me why I go to the movies in the first place."	5.0	A triumphal achievement in adventure filmmaking, if a little bloated	2006-02-03	5	3	2

Is the same Peter Jackson that directed Heavenly Creatures and Lord of the Rings? My God it looked like one of those cheap videos in youtube. The dialogs were so cheesy. Again, Is Adrien Brody an actor? Jack Black is a good comedian, but here is out of place. His face is just so funny, when he wants to be serious in a scene you can avoid to laugh as hell. Naomi Watts looks like a rookie driver in his first day driving the beltway. The character is too much for her.

Duncan ""movie fan"""	"Ann weeps buckets for poor Kong, while dozens die trying to save her; blondes in New York who aren't Ann are callously tossed aside in a manner that makes you laugh, except it isn't funny; the bones of his previous ""brides"" indicate they were ripped limb-from-limb.  But, you know, poor Kong.The ""ick"" factor was remarkably high, especially the bugs and the pink snake things.And pretty much every scene was too long.  EVERYTHING seemed to go on and on and on.  And they spent so much time with the minor characters that you cared about them and that made it harder as they kept on getting knocked off.I thought the cgi was good and realistic (there is such a variance it's amazing to me...the Hulk never looked real for one minute, Kong looks good).  And the acting was pretty good, including Jack Black (after all the character is meant to be broad).The trouble with everything taking so long is that you start to lose that essential suspension of belief.  Early on I'm thinking that ship is too small to take Kong back to NY.  The ship takes quite a pounding on the rocks, but then all is well without going to a drydock.  How do the villagers live exactly on all that bare rock?  The ape moves in true ape fashion (on all fours) but then is carrying Ann in its front feet and she doesn't get mashed to a pulp?  How come Ann doesn't get hypothermia (not to mention goose-bumps) being out in all that cold weather in her sleeveless dress for a long damn time, not to mention the wind at the top of the Empire State Building.  I know I'm nit-picking, but a movie has to have some logic (or at least live within the boundaries of its own particular story logic).Sorry, I think Peter Jackson is capable of better.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A17LSEN4UY4XZQ	M. Daneker	"The issue with a 3hr remake of a 2hr film is that with nothing new to say, what holds the attention of the audience? Watching the film I was dumbstruck watching the special effects and irritatingly looking for flaws (I couldn't help it.) I didn't want to, but I kept doing it anyway. The entire film is one big special effect and for some reason it doesn't bother me in Star Wars or LOTR, it bugged me here.I also loved and hated the homage to the original, while it was nice, it was distracting to hear the old dialogue verbatim (as part of the film within the film.) I just remembered more and more how I already new what was going to happen.In the end just like I got tired of watching the hobbits bounce on the shoulders of the tree ent in ""the two towers"" so here I got very tired of one shot after the next of Watts in Kong's mechanical hand bouncing around before a green screen.The first and last hours (in New York) are the best, the island part is tedious action and you really decide at this point that Blacks Character has no redeeming qualities (I keep wishing Kong would step on him) as he sacrifices life after life for a movie he never makes. And why? WHY??? Would you display Kong in an theater in Manhattan? It Makes no sense!!! He could take Kong into the middle of Kansas and people by the tens of thousands would drive to see it. What, what where the penguin suits and gowns in the audience supposed to do for the rest of the two hours after the initial shock of looking at a great, giant gorilla wore off? I was dumb struck by that in both films.Finally, when Kong and Watts are ""together"" on screen the film works. All the action and dialogue is filler to get them together and let the emotional roller coaster begin. Those scenes save the film and Andy Serkis deserves and Academy Award, damnit.A leaner, tighter film with less about everything but the gorilla and the girl would have been perfect, this is merely good."	4.0	Perhaps if I didn't know what was going to happen.	2006-03-17	4	1	3

The first hour is boring, and not because of the lack of action.  It is boring in the contrary to the first hour of ""Spider-Man 2,"" which contained little first-hour action but maintained a great sense of character development and humor.  The next two hours are just too long, espeically the exuberant and exaggerated use of semi-slow motion filming during the Skull Island native scenes (bringing to mind the ridiculous filmmaking in ""The Patriot"").  The whole scene where the giant leeches and bugs kill the party also reflected years of cheesy film violence from inferior filmmakers to Peter Jackson.  The writing was less mature and refined than the LOTR series, including the use of profanity and cheesy lines instead of actually showing greater intelligence in the scripting of the movie.I absolutely loved the scenes where Kong was actually on screen and agree with the Academy Awards(c) decisions to grant them awards for sound, design, etc.  The T-Rexes vs. Kong scenes were incredible, Anne and Kong's relationship was much deeper than in previous ""Kongs,"" and the final scenes in New York were masterful.All in all, this movie lacked too much to become either a great movie or a classic movie.  2 or 2 1/2 stars are all it deserves."	2.0	Overrated	2006-03-08	23	8	15

I entered the theater pretty much pissed that I wasn't going to be able to go see Rent a second time.  I left it feeling totally different.  That movie changed me in so many ways.  I felt compassion for a CGI monkey.  Kong became almost like your best friend and you wanted to fight for him.  The acting performances given by Naomi Watts, Adrien Brody, and Jack Black were amazing.  I have so much respect for Naomi Watts.  It was truly an AMAZING acting job.  For most of the film she is acting with a green screen and men in costumes poking her with giant sticks, yet she doesn't let that stop her from giving a great, tear-drawing performance.  Even actors in some of the smaller parts such as Preston (Colin Hanks) and Jimmy (Jamie Bell) give an awesome performance.Peter Jackson is a genius!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2OIG88PG8K4M3	"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado"""	"The 2005 ""King Kong"" ends with this sentiment: ""It was beauty killed the beast."" Perhaps in the classic 1933 version, but not in Peter Jackson's epic reimagining of it. His ""Kong"" retains the essential story elements of the original, but elevates the tale beyond its origins. Instead of a simple ""beauty and the beast"" action adventure, this ""Kong"" emerges as a kind of paean to naturalism, a condemnation of the technology that at once makes the world and peoples' minds smaller. It is a tale involving the sort of wonder, horror, and beauty that I have not seen on the big screen...well, since Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" films.The film starts off with thirties-style credits, immediately evoking a mood for the piece that is kept throughout. Then Jackson does something unexpected for a big-budget action picture: he proceeds for a good forty-five minutes to show nothing but normal, mundane human activity. Soup lines, public workers, failing businesses, Depression-era hunger and quiet desperation. He allows us to understand why a faltering director like Carl Denham would throw everything away on a final gamble, and why a delicate young actress like Ann Darrow would get on a filthy steamer in the middle of the night and sail off to an unknown location. It is an unusual choice for a filmmaker, but it works, particularly in contrast with what follows.Jackson also makes use of his experience with epics in ""Kong"": the second half of the movie, in stark contrast to the first, frequently feels like one giant extended chase scene, but with the exception of one particularly disgusting episode involving mammoth insects, the pacing never slacks, and the thrills simply get bigger and better. Dinosaurs, bugs, savage tribes, more dinosaurs, and forces of nature all make malicious appearances in attempts to hinder the crew, yet the narrative rarely ever feels strained. Here is a three-hour movie that one never realizes is three hours while watching it. Part of this is due to Jackson's wise echoing of Spielberg in his treatment of the ""monster."" Kong doesn't make an appearance until well over an hour into the film, but there are ominous foreshadowings of him from very early on: a strange shadow on a map, simian rock formations, murmurs of a name, the score rumbling in low growls. When Kong finally appears, the tension has been built up to such an extent that it comes as a shock to finally see him. The payoff is enormous.Kong himself is astonishing. He is animated using the same kind of motion-capture performance technology that Jackson used for Gollum in the ""Rings"" films, and using the same actor, too, Andy Serkis, who does more than just play a mammoth ape: his Kong just may be the most human character in the film. He runs, jumps, and fights most impressively - at point he faces down no fewer than three Tyrannosaurus Rexes - but most endearing are his quiet, tender scenes with Ann. One particularly haunting scene involves the two on a frozen pond in Central Park: Kong slides and frolics on the ice in what can only be described as delighted wonder, and his expression is mirrored by Ann. They have a connection, a chemistry, that not even the writer Jack Driscoll, with all his wonderful words, can match.Naomi Watts does quite well in the role of the blonde damsel: she seems as though she cannot quite decide whether she is in distress or not. Like Fay Wray before her, she does her fair share of screaming, but she also has a certain delicate strength to her that is intriguing, both to us and to Kong; she is not afraid to fight back and to use her talents to her advantage. She forces Kong to respect her, and allows him to protect her, and it is this that forms the basis of their strange, primal connection. When she screams in horror in the final climax, it is not because of the ape climbing the Empire State Building; it is because of those in relentless pursuit of him.The supporting players are as good as anything else in the movie. Adrian Brody and Jack Black are perhaps not obvious choices for action movies, but they fill their characters perfectly, in ways that are both obvious and surprising. Brody plays Jack Driscoll, a playwright whose dreams lie with the theatre, but who manages to get ensnared in Denham's web. Judging from the look on his face as he watches Ann, one suspects he does not entirely mind. Brody has a quiet, intense, almost suffering look to him at times that suits his character perfectly: here is a man who is more at home with typewriters than T-rexes, who nevertheless manages to rewrite himself in order to save the girl. He is not necessarily happy about things he must do, but he does them.Played by Jack Black, the film director Carl Denham is more than a determined filmmaker; he is slick and clever, a perpetual opportunist, who manipulates coincidence to his advantage and takes his cameras on rescue missions. Should there ever be a choice presented to him between the two, one strongly suspects it is the camera that would emerge victorious. Black does not play Denham as a likeable or a good man, but he is supremely entertaining to watch. He is the sort of man who is dogged by nerve-wrackingly close calls, and yet it is rarely him that they effect, but those surrounding him. One character describes him as having an ""innate ability to destroy the things he loves."" Perhaps this is inaccurate; he does not seem to love anything but himself, and he is the one character who comes out the least unscathed. This, however, may be the point of the film: at the end, Denham has not lost much of anything that he cared about, but perhaps it is the caring that is most important.The effects are not all entirely convincing, but I'm not certain they are meant to be: they evoke that kind of larger-than-life, dreamlike quality that fantasies always seem to have. One such instance is a remarkable dinosaur stampede on the island: the creatures don't have the same solid feel that, say, the ""Jurassic Park"" dinosaurs have, but it works. They look more menacing, more bizarre this way. They are definitely not natural, and I think this is the point. The CG Manhattan that Kong is unleashed upon also has this dreamlike, less-than-solid feel: buildings and lights are hazy, sometimes in clearer focus than others, but this makes it a Manhattan that suits Kong: it may not have existed, but it is enticing - and a little scary - to think that it might have.The climactic scene is one of the best I can remember in films for some time. Planes circle Kong like vultures hovering over a doomed beast, while Ann makes a mad-dash attempt to get to him, though what exactly she could do is not clear. The reversion of the roles is striking: where once Kong protected her, now Ann desperately tries to protect him. When the inevitable happens, it has a quiet, deep emotional resonance that caught me by surprise, even though I had already grown to like the giant ape. I was shocked to discover that I was crying. ""King Kong"" is a movie of shocking beauty, passion, and impact.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1AYN3IIUNQCIA	"Melanie Edwards ""book worm"""	once again, peter jackson wows us with another one of his great big over the top movies. fresh of his LOTR victory, jackson has now turned his gaze to the 1930 classic king kong making it longer (about 190+ minutes long) bigger (big mad ape) and more spectacular (can we say dinosaur fights anyone?) this is what you'll get for king kong. the film is just like the old version but is mainly divided into three sections. the first is in new york were we meet anne darrow, a struggling actress who might hit it big when carl denham (in a role were its hard to belive jack black is being serious) ask her to star in his film produced buy her idol, producer jack driscoll. then it moves into the second part of the film, skull island and here is were the action takes off as we meet the movies BIG star. then it moves to the third part of the film were kong is taken back to new york and then you know the rest, ape captures girl, ape climbs to the top of building, planes shoot ape down, everyone crys, the end. the one thing that surprised me was king kong was not the big hollywood cash cow of winter, instead chronicles of narnia and HP4 (no surpries) became the real big winners but then again it would be pretty hard to sit through a three hour long film about a ape, so i dont blame you but still, its now on DVD that way you can pause the film when you have to go to the bathroom. so see jacksons next triumph.	5.0	jackson, you do no wrong	2006-03-04	3	2	1

Franz	Well, I just watched this very long movie with my wife and after more than three hours, we couldn't wait to see if ANYBODY had actually given this movie a positive review. As you can see elsewhere, people did! I cannot posibly imagine why and after reading these reviews I can only conclude that these people must have watched a completely different movie! This is the most ridiculous, drawn-out schlock I have seen in a very long time. It is so incredibly trite and exaggerated that I couldn't help but roll my eyes and laugh out loud that valuable resources were wasted to make this. The movie is as gripping as watching someone fly-fish! Had I had the misfortune of watching this in a theater, I would have walked out.I give Jackson credit for his work on Lord of the Rings but after this, I can only hope that he is not allowed to ever make another movie again.

Sure, there could have been a few minutes edited out, but maybe those few minutes I want out, someone else just loves. So what do you do? Anyway, part of the strength is the length, giving time for character development. Woooooow! What a awe-inspiring idea. Alright, maybe they could have cut out the ""Jimmy"" guy, but who's to say for sure. There are simply too many wannabe critics out there with short attention spans, just because there's no ""action"" right away, they feel the movie drags on, or is way too long.Now, on to more important things, Naomi Watts, she should have been given an Oscar nomination for her role as Ann Darrow. Doing so much with so little dialogue and she lit up the screen like no one I'd ever seen.Finally, with this DVD you can stop the movie anytime, use the restroom, go to the kitchen, blow your nose or just take some deep breathes outside, or maybe do all four.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1TJPMB7N776WS	MICHAEL ACUNA	"Director Peter Jackson has done the seemingly impossible: he has revived the 70 year old King Kong franchise and more to the point: made it fun, exciting, romantic, scary and touching. All this from a story about a giant Ape, the woman he loves (the luminous Naomi Watts) and the man (a fun, demented Jack Black) who would exploit them.The CGI work is the best I've seen though at times the seams show...but not nearly as often as I would have thought. Also, at 3 hours the film is too long by about a  hour and most of this time is spent CGI'ing as in the characters fighting with and running from assorted pre-historic creatures. Most of this action is good and sometimes even amazing but there's just too much of it.Jackson does not skimp on the human element either. Though the storyline is basic he populates this film with the very best actors: Naomi Watts as his heroine Ann Darrow, Jack Black as Carl Darrow and Adrian Brody as Jack Driscoll. All of these actors treat their characters with respect, give their all and it elevates their characters from wallpaper to living, breathing human beings.""King Kong""is breathtaking on many levels and personal and touching on others: what more could you ask for in a movie?"	4.0	KONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2005-12-17	8	6	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2G6GO4O7EVCPF	Michael Bolts	Jack Black (School of Rock, High Fidelity) stars as Carl Denham, a director who has found a map to a place called Skull Island. He assembles his crew, he hires a captain and his ship and he hires a beautful Ann Darrow, played by the beautiful Nicole Kidman look alike Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr., The Ring) and they go on a voyage to find this mysterious Skull Island. They arrive there not knowing what's going to happen but then they meet the natives....scary looking natives who kill some of them but they flee. The natives eventually come back and kidnap Naomi Watts, bring her back to their place and strap her down so that she can be sacrificed to KONG, who is a massive Ape. Black, his crew and Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Jacket), who plays Jack Driscoll, go off with the captain and his men to go rescue Watts from her awaited doom but she is taking into the jungle by the Ape and suddenly Kong becomes lost in her beauty. The hunt continues as the rest of the gang faces great perils, dinosaurs, lizards, nasty looking bugs to try to resue Watts. Jack Black wants to capture the Ape and they do by cholorforming it. They bring Kong back to Manhattan where Kong becomes King Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World but Kong then escapes causing more havoc, breaking out in the streets, climbing building...he even throws blonde woman away as he tries to find his. Then we all know what happens, King Kong climbs the empire state building with the blonde girl, airplanes come and so forth. Peter Jackson triumphs making it a welcome tribute the to the original one (which is still good by the way), with an excellent cast despite some cheesy effects...an example being the longneck dinosaurs pursuing the resue party. This blows away the Jeff Bridges one too (which was god awful and even more god awful when they put a crown on King Kong's head in that one). It's long...yes, but that creates story and we get to know the characters more better....enjoy it and if you cant, well then you're just a crab apple.

This is an awesome filmmaking achievement, with some of the best special effects ever captured on the screen.  We all know the story, so it was up to Jackson to create a new vision of the tale and that he has done.  Although the movie starts slowly, once they reach Skull Island, the movie never lets up:  Kong vs. the Tyrannosaures is brilliant, especially the dizzying battle on the hanging vines; the terrifying bug attacks; the finale on the Empire State Building which is both terrifying and poignantly touching; the dinosaur stampede; it's all beautifully done.  Naomi Watts shines as Ann Darrow, the beauty to the giant beast.  Watts captures the fervor in which the relationship develops, and of course using Andy Sirkis digitally as Kong is pure genius.  He gives Kong a truly individual personality never captured in either of the first two films.  Adrian Brody is good as the writer who shares Ann's passion for the beast.  Only Jack Black as Denham is miscast, and although ineffectual, he doesn't hurt the movie.  Wonder why they didn't go for a better actor in this role?Anyway, KING KONG is everything a big Hollywood movie should be and the Oscars while honoring ""message"" films this year, failed to recognize the most entertaining and technically superior film of all this year--KING KONG."	5.0	KING OF THE KONGS	2006-03-31	2	1	1

The insect pit was a waste of time and contributed NOTHING to the story - it's only a chance to show off the latest technologies.  This was a pure endulgence for Peter and WETA, and nothing more.  I am very disappointed that the priorities of this movie were so far off base.  Everything looked so CGI, except Kong, believe it or not.  That's where they went wrong.  Had Peter just focused on the main story line, and not gotten side tracked with cheap thrills and gross outs, we would have a much better movie.

There were several times I said to myself ""enough with the CGI creatures and crawlies, let's get on with the story."" I'm becoming more and more convinced that CGI is too powerful a tool for most movie makers to handle. There simply isn't enough restraint while using it. Peter Jackson should have stuck with the LOTR movies, as they were more in the nature of an epic storyline.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AWOSS0OBKHTJC	"Michael F. Hopkins ""A Deeper Groove"""	"(from an earlier feature, copyright 2005 Michael F. Hopkins)If anyone thought that director Peter Jackson wouldrest on the laurels of his grand success in adaptingTolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS into three of the finestmovies ever made, this film will make them stop andwonder anew. Jackson's long-awaited upgrade of KINGKONG is a superb motion picture, balancing wit andtragedy, satire and sentiment, delivered withrippling power and a passionate depth which willnot be ignored.Bypassing the camped-up travesty from Lorenzo SempleJr. and Dino DeLaurentiis which stunk up the late1970s, the Oscar winning scriptwriting team of Jackson,Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens grow their story fromthe original 1930s RKO classic; paying persistenthomage and respect, while filling out the storyeven further. Where the original KONG was a productof the Depression era, Jackson's KONG provides asharp perspective of those turbulent times, andwhat such sheer desperation could drive one todo.Those who complain about the film's 3 hour pluslength, particularly those who bemoan the film'sfirst hour need to watch the film, not theirstopwatches. Jackson's sense of pacing, so crucialto deliver the lengthy RING cycle, serves himwell once more. KONG's pacing is brisk and fluid,at times cutting as a pitchman's jive, at othertimes as gentle as a precious moment quietlyshared. In a word, it smokes.Further, the first hour is the all-crucial introof characters and motivations, which is a particularpoint where Jackson, cast, and crew nurture theoriginal tale of thrill-seeking showmanship intoa saga of clueless adventurers running headlonginto their own worst nightmares.Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens bring this particularpoint home with their broader look into the keyindividuals of the steamship's crew. Instead ofone-spot bodies to be dumped over the cliff, weare given a diverse array of characters which theaudience has a deeper stake in, whatever happens.Even when the tale dangles the poignant threadof Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"" as agaze into the myriad motivations at hand, wehave at least one spot which revels in an equallyunholy obsession borne straight from HermanMelville's ""Moby Dick"".... or Clint Eastwood's""White Hunter, Black Heart.""While Thomas Kretschmann's Captain Engelhornpaints a tougher, more wary seafarer than the crustydepiction in the original film, the one to watchmost vividly is First Mate Hayes, a wise andworld-weathered sailor beautifully deliveredby Evan Parke. Of all on the ship, it is Parke'scharacter who knows exactly what's in storefor most of them, and warns young Jimmy(a Jack London-like wayfarer brought home bythe fine talent of Jamie Bell) that what's comingis no adventure full of derring-do, fortune andglory to be had by all. Time and tragic trespassprove the fatal accuracy of Hayes' words.Speaking of that very trespass, Jackson's wry depictionof endangered indigenous people reacting to outsideintrusion vs. the pitiful minstrelsy of grass-skirted""natives"" selling doo-dah stereotypes on ""The GreatWhite Way"" is an ingenious set of scenes in themselves.Between this and the weather-beaten compassion of Parke'sperformance, Jackson, cast and crew directly addressthe one great flaw in the original KING KONG, andmasterfully turns it around.However one may have expected the LORD OF THE RINGScomposer Howard Shore to provide the music here, theever-conceptual James Newton Howard delivers amasterwork of a score. Able to turn motifs on a dime,and keep the balance of the greater drama(s) at handat all times, this KING KONG score is one of theall-time classics.Already acclaimed for his epic scores for the penetratingfilms of M. Night Shyamalan, and other standouts (such ashis rippling 2003 score for P. J. Hogan's definitive takeon PETER PAN), Howard is justly recognized as one of themost multitalented of all film scorists. His occasionalquote of a Max Steiner passage from the original KONG'slegendary score is a dutiful riot! All in all, Howarddelivers quite an inspirational feat of composition,all around.Alan Lee's design work, once more, is sheer magic. Atpoints, some of the Skull Island overviews touch uponFrank Frazetta's legendary vistas, capped with Lee'sown touch of the substantially fantastic.No faerie lands here, the ethereal eye of the highly-acclaimed illustrator captures the dangerous allure ofthe prehistoric jungle, rife with dinosaurs and assortedcrawling ghastlies which recall Jackson's earlier workin the Horror field. With each peril, however, Lee,Jackson and the remarkable team at WETA imparts thepresence of an unknown world; an unknown which isneedlessly disturbed in the name of Western financialpursuit.Just as aptly, the traps and hypocrisies of the Westernjungle are depicted with stunning detail. Hearing AlJolson sing about good times and lots of money, whilethe film's opening unveils scene after scene of cripplingwant, is as sharp a reflection of the tale's timelessduality as one can get; a particularly special summationof the times that this tale comes from.In this, Kyle Chandler, Adrien Brody and Jack Blackunveil a brilliant comment of the differing faces of showbiz, then and now. Brody plays a creative auteur entrappedamidst corporate confinement and exploitation, whileBlack captures the chummy-sounding personification ofokeydoke on the make, and Chandler portrays a Grade-Bleading-man hopelessly full of himself.For all the bluster of Black's Carl Denham, or thepreening of Chandler's Bruce Baxter (a comment on theoriginal KONG's Bruce Cabot?), it is the quiet wisdomof Brody's Jack Driscoll which rises to the occasion,meeting each new danger with great courage. Needing tocome to grips with his own words, Driscoll will dare tocross lethal terrain, and stand at the top of theworld to secure the well-being of one special woman.Let's talk about that woman. Naomi Watts is justplain wonderful. To Ann Darrow, she brings the airof naivete, gusto, wit and wide-eyed innocence whichmarked Fay Wray's original portrayal of the role.With this, Watts adds an astonishing depth inprojecting the despair of virtue besieged by thedespairing times of The ""Great"" Depression. Too,with her uncanny ability to gain Kong's respect,Watts certainly brings new meaning to the term""Broadway trouper""! Small wonder that Ms. Wray,just before she passed on in 2004, gave Ms. Watts herpersonal blessing. A signature performance.Which brings us to the standout work of Andy Serkis.If you think his body language was superb portrayingGollum in THE LORD OF THE RINGS, wait until you seehis bravura performance delivering the unspokendrives of the Great Ape. WETA's digital imagery doesthe original's SFX wizard, Willis O'Brien, great honorwith their wondrous genius, but it is Serkis' giftedphysicality which brings the majesty and tragedyof KING KONG so achingly home.In turn, it is between Serkis' Chaplin-worthy pantomime,and Watts' grasp upon the loneliness lurking beneath theterror, that the saga's crucial bond takes firm hold here.What ensues with Kong and Ann is not a lust misplaced bymenace, but the camaraderie of two lost souls; each facingthe abyss, shorn of illusions for a brighter future. Whatcomes from that bond is what makes this KING KONG so very,very special.Now we wait for Jackson and friends to deliver THE HOBBIT!Meanwhile, an image I will carry in my mind and soul, foryears to come, is that view from the Empire State Building;looking into the vast, unknown horizon, for one lovingmoment, without grief or fear..."	5.0	Climbing The Summit, Daring The Fall.	2005-12-19	0	0	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	"If there's any further proof necessary that the best filmmakers are those who passionately love their material, it's Peter Jackson.  It's hard to believe that Jackson could top his painstaking adherence to details he exhibited in Lord of the Rings, but he does just that in with King Kong, a subject with considerably less material to round it out.  After all, this is just a story about a big monkey, right? Jackson disagrees.Kong's story is now a part of American culture: a giant gorilla (Kong, a digital puppet controlled by Andy Serkis of Gollum fame) lurks somewhere on a mysterious island, a world populated by fantastic dinosaurs and creepy crawlies of all types.  Accustomed to battling predators for his food, we discover that Kong is the last of his kind.  It is here that Carl Denham (Jack Black) will film his new movie.  To that end, he ropes in Ann Darrow (the lovely Naomi Watts) and Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler) as his leads along with scriptwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody). Even the crew has been hoodwinked into going. There's no one that Carl won't lie to, including the financiers of his film.Unfortunately for the crew, they actually manage to discover Skull Island.  After an attack by the natives, Anne is kidnapped and sacrificed to Kong.  Kong decides there's something different about her (the implication is that it's her blonde hair).  Anne relies on all of her thespian powers to keep the big gorilla from smashing her head in.  Which is a good thing, because she always wanted to be a comedienne but could never find an audience.  With Kong, she gets the chance to do physical comedy.  Kong finds it hysterical, proving that tripping and falling on your face is a universally funny joke.But their idyllic relationship, with Kong as protector, is not to last.  Eventually, Anne is rescued and Kong is captured, brought back to New York to serve as a Broadway act. As terrifying and frightening as he seems, Kong is no match for the urban jungle.  There's nothing Carl won't exploit, including the very wonder of discovery.  He stages a vulgar show that trusses the giant gorilla up in chains.  A winsome sacrifice is presented, just like on Skull Island...only it's not Anne.  Things do downhill (or, if you prefer, drop from a considerable height) from there.  You know the rest.This version of King Kong is a masterful, outsized version of the 1930s original.  By staying true to the characters, the movie ends up being more of a silent screen piece, filled with affectionate gazes between Kong and Anne.  Communication is limited between the two characters, but it's a testament to Jackson's directing that we can see the connection.  Kong's eyes are amazingly expressive, more so than his human counterparts. This is a welcome departure from the 1970s version, where Jessica Lange constantly began every sentence with, ""Kong..."" so the audience was reminded she was talking to the gorilla.  We got it, thanks.Amazingly, Black manages to keep his manic energy tightly focused.  The character of Carl is believable through both Black's action as well as his pop-eyed sneers.  Although he feigns courage, sorrow, and affection, Carl is the real monster in this movie and it's to Black's credit that he's a believable character rather than a one-note cipher.Everyone else is essentially sidelined by the special effects, which are off-the-wall insane.  Kong himself is fantastically rendered, but that's expected.  What is surprising are the fauna of Skull Island.  Giant flying bats, carnivorous muck worms, killer centipedes, rampaging velociraptors, tyrannosaurus rexes (sorry, V-rexes), brontosauruses, and a bunch of other outsized monsters stomp, screech, and ultimately die at Kong's giant hands.  Forget Jurassic Park, Kong combines a brontosaurus stampede with velociraptor chase that ends with an awful creepy-crawly fest that will make you want to take a shower afterwards. And then there's the three-way battle between T-rexes and Kong that has to be seen to be believed.If there's a flaw, it's the set up and arrival of the natives.  Alternately meant to be spooky and pathetic, Jackson resorts to a lot of blurry shots.  I hate blurry shots.  I hate them with a passion.  The only time I've ever felt that a blurry camera shot is necessary was in Gladiator, where it was a welcome reprieve from gut-wrench combat...in essence, the audience needed a breather.  In the 70s and 80s, the blur technique was used to cover up low-budget effects in horror movies (see The Watcher for a more modern egregious example).  It slows the film down, is particularly jarring in tone, and ultimately does the sequence a disservice.  The natives are scary all on their own without blurry camera angles.  It's the only time in the whole film that you actually feel the three hours.But that's a minor quibble. Jackson's body of work is evidence that one day, fanboys will rule the world. Here's hoping we'll have more directors like him who revere their material as deeply."	5.0	Jackson's body of work is evidence that one day, fanboys will rule the world	2006-01-02	4	2	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A10J55VI3EFL5V	Michael King	Peter Jackson has firmly established himself as a director on the level of masters like Steven Spielberg. King Kong takes us on a journey ranging from the highest highs to the lowest lows. This is truly a stunningly powerful remake of the classic tale--a tale which inspired Mr. Jackson to get into film making in the first place.First and foremost are the special effects. Let's face it, this whole movie hinges on whether or not Kong is believable. We all remember The Hulk which brought us the inhuman, laughable green man-thing. Not the case here: Jackson creates a beast that is not only believable, but lovable and powerful as well. His quirky mannerisms and expressions shine on the big screen, as does his fascination with the lovely Ms. Darrow.Beyond Kong, are the dinosaurs and bugs. Kong does battle with several fierce dinos to protect Ann and the action sequences are incredible as are the dinosaurs themselves. Ann's rescue squad come across some problems of their own in the form of large insects and blobs that eat you one limb at a time. All if which is both exciting an disgusting. The SGI guys working on Jurassic Park 4 might want to take notes here.Jackson goes even further and creates a complete digital model of 1933 Manhattan. Every single building is remade. Why you ask? So during the final shots of Kong battling the airplanes on top of the Empire State Building, Jackson is free to use broad and uncompromised camera angles. The entire final sequence is emotionally draining and acrophobic as the height and scale are surreal.The final compelling attribute to King Kong is the bond between him and Ann Darrow. All Kong wants is to be with her and protect her. He battles dinosaurs, people and airplanes to be so. When he's taken to NYC and teased with a fake Ann, he goes ballistic to find her. Their reunion is both beautiful and sad since we all know the final outcome. Kong's chase though crowded Manhattan is another spectacular display.All in all, this film is an astonishing piece of cinematic work. Jackson nails every single aspect of what an action movie slash love story should be. While some say its a bit long, you do get sucked in and time goes by rather quickly. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, period.	5.0	Peter Jackson is a master...	2006-03-29	4	3	1

There was no chemistry between the actors involved, unlike the chemistry between Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges in the 1976 version. They made the original remake actually work--no small task considering the fact that the special effects amounted to a man in an ape suit who slouched and beat his chest. The latest version of ""King Kong"" was another story entirely. Despite having access to spectacular special effects, fails on every level. Even the special effects were cheasy and overdone. I was left yawning, waiting for the next scene to start. One of my biggest problems with the movie was the gratutious violence. Kong was not portrayed as a confused, albeit fearsome monster who elicits a certain level of sympathy, instead, the new Kong is portrayed as a mean-spirited, blood-thirsty sociopath who kills for no particular reason. When this monster is finally killed in the end, one is not left feeling sympathy, but relief instead.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3063XSY41NDCR	"Michael P. Ofarrell ""irish mike"""	"As a technical tour de force Peter Jackson's re-make of the classic 1933 ""King Kong"" has some merit, but as a humdinger of a story with thrills and chills the original has the new film beaten by a mile. How ironic, in that director Jackson and his screen writers had the blueprint of the original script in the palm of their hands, yet they managed to emerge with a film that never took off: the story meandered all over the place. The early New York City scenes were duly impressive but as with everything else in the movie, done to excess. As the movie went on the promise of a major motion picture event evaporated and the film became an endurance test on the hindquarters. Here is a film where the hype took precedence over actual achievement. Jackson's Kong is a movie so enamored of its subject , so filled with ""in references"" to Old Hollywood and Broadway (granted, amusing up to a point) that it lays there like the huge monster's corpse at the film's finale. There is no forward momentum, no real character development, and absolutely no chemistry between the lovely Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody. who is badly miscast. The original ""King Kong"" remains the definitive version of this story."	2.0	King Long	2006-03-03	24	13	11
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3F4V1W3IINU19	Michael R. Lachance	A truly great film and remarkably worth every cent to go see.... Kong was as good as I could have imagined and truly came to life. Naomi Watts' performace was top notch..  and she is without a doubt extremely attractive and the perfect actress for the role.Unfortunately, I was let down by Jack Black's hollow, weak and unconvincingly creepy performance as Carl Denham. This was very unfortunate, as every other aspect of this new film stood it's own. This Carl Denham was hollow and unconvincing. The continuous creepy stare thrown in at every opportunity did not illustrate a man of obsession, but more a psychotic lune. On top of this Jack Blacks line readings were understated, ineffective and unconvincing.In EVERY other way, this film delivers. Any film that can deliver so much emotion and attachment to a 25 foot Gorilla has something special to recognize. Kong is truly a tragic character in this film and as such Peter Jackson has done what hasn't been done since 1933. We feel for Kong and BELIEVE every bit of codependence between Ann Darrow and the Ape. This, in itself, makes a beautiful film.And as may be expected, the special effects are amazing. Kong is, in every way REAL. Although the biplane sequences and a few car shots were flawed, Skull Island was a gem in filmmaking.See King Kong. A great new film, standing proudly beside the '33 Original.	4.0	Watts = yes... Black = no...  Otherwise 5 stars! Awesome!	2005-12-16	1	0	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AEZDXF5HC9UJ1	Michael Sanders	I've never really been a big fan of King Kong, but I have seen all three versions. I think my mom took me to see the 70s version when I was a kid. Anyway, last night I sat down and watched Peter Jackson's latest version. Although the movie is 3 hours long, I didn't even notice. Some movies are too long at 2 hours, but Kong was just right at 3 hours. The length of the movie matches it's grand scale. Overall, I must say that King Kong lives up to the hype - a wonderfully wild ride. It reminded me of the first Indiana Jones movie - a modern movie with an old serial adventure feel.Kong weaves a fantastic story in a believable fashion, pulling few if any punches. The relationship between the female lead (Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow) and King Kong is both refreshingly realistic and poignant. The movie has a depth of story which I wasn't expecting. The scenes of depression era New York are absolutely stunning in it's realism. Jackson should be commended for this alone. He also spends a good deal of time on character development. Most of the characters are multi-dimensional, but it is clear that the main characters are Ann Darrow and Kong. Interestingly, it is Kong himself who undergoes the greatest transformation from beginning to end.Be warned - there is plenty of violence - Skull Island is no place for the faint of heart! I'm not particularly squeamish, but there are two scenes involving larger-than-life bugs that I won't soon forget - ugh! I read an interview with Jackson who said the original 1930s version had a similar scene which was removed after the initial screening - apparently people in the audience got nauseous and some even threw up. Jackson pointedly (and eagerly) added his version of the 1930s deleted scene - gee, thanks!	5.0	King Kong, A Remake Worth Seeing	2006-04-08	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A4RQ549E9K6B4	Michael S. Fleischer	"King Kong (Universal, 2005) opens with a stark reminder that we are not so far removed from the blight of a global depression, which is as close to us, today, as the precarious slip of a capital economy. Prescient images of shapeless shanties, relentless poverty, and quiet desperation in America's First City, which suffused the ""civilized"" world, still captivate us nearly four score years later.The film transports everyone--viewers, protagonists, and antagonists alike--to and from two insidious jungles, presumably by way of the Bermuda triangle (how else can one depart from the Northeast Atlantic, arrive in the Southwest Pacific, and then return to homeport in so short a span of time?) Man's jungle is a bleak labyrinth of concrete canyons framed by elevated trains, aimlessly clacking their way along rickety iron rails through a sooty city overpopulated with treacherous opportunists and callous moviemakers. They prey on the masses, numbed by appalling unemployment and deceitful indifference. The marginally fortunate are underemployed tradesmen, craftsmen, artisans, athletes and entertainers--the real Houdini's of society, escape artists who eke-out a bare bones existence. One of these is the hauntingly beautiful and melancholy Ann Darrow, a stage actress blessed with essential vaudevillian skills, yet possessing an uncommon taste for literature, particularly the insightful, allegorical tomes of author and playwright, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody). We sympathize with Ann since she has lost the support of her grandfatherly mentor who, after one too many failures on the Great White Way, has decided to return, disheartened, to hometown, Chicago, to test fate in yet another urban jungle. With this turn of events, Ann is forced to forage hand-to-mouth; it begins her descent into the ranks of the nameless underclass. Temptation approaches her in a Mephistophelian offer to sell her soul to venality, in a burlesque act, in exchange for material subsistence, which she rejects, knowing full well the alternative will forever taint her spirit. Ann's hell is unforgiving. So, too, is Kong's. His is the lost world of Skull Island, a foliated tropic in the uncharted high seas, inhabited by carnivorous, Jurassic-styled reptiles, monstrous arthropods and, as unlikely as it seems, Paleolithic mammals indigenous to the last ice age. They are the true masters of their ""Johnny-come-lately"" adversaries--Homo sapiens, represented by ritually obsessed Bushmen, and their less evolved, 20th Century cousins, self-absorbed actors, including the inimitable Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler). His film crew is ""misled"" by the impetuous Carl Denham (Jack Black), which has been navigated by ""take `em back alive"" gunrunners and poachers, commanded by the mercenary merchant marine, Captain Englehorn (Thomas Kretchmann), and mates. No question, Peter Jackson enjoys poking fun at himself and his industry.Both venues bear witness to the irrepressible brutality of mortal life stewarded without solace--except for the saving grace of a self-enlightened Darrow (Watts) whose landing party on Skull Island spoils the impending sacrifice of a young bush girl to assuage the Great Kong. She finds herself the intended replacement and is fastidiously abducted by the tribe for this purpose. Before long, Kong catches-up with Ann, and so begins one of most unusual romances in film history, fraught with mistrust and fear before easing into mutual respect and platonic love. In a memorable scene, Ann shimmers in the dawning light like Venus, the morning star, staying Kong's killing hand just long enough for them to worship the beauty of a sunrise. The moment mesmerizes them as they perch atop a cliff in Kong's inhospitable backyard and watch the fiery globe, magnified on the horizon, kiss the illuminated Sea goodbye, for another day, as it gently lifts itself from the latter's swelling embrace. Unbeknownst to them, destiny will oblige them to witness this miracle again, in Ann's backyard, atop the less hospitable Empire State Building. Beauty and Beast will gaze wondrously eastward--this time, in the direction of Lady Liberty, the imperishable light of the new world.Screenwriters Fran Walsh, Philipa Boyens, and Peter Jackson do not conceal the mythical allegory of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Just how close they came in having the ""Eighth Wonder of the World,"" brilliantly played by Andy Serkis, wrestle away Jimmy's (Jamie Bell) overdue copy of the author's celebrated novella and whack us upside the head with it is anyone's best guess. Weta's Argonauts beckon us to plumb the depths of Conrad's classic to draw deeper meaning from the poignant references to ""beauty and the beast"" that Merrion Cooper and Edgar Wallace cleverly dialoged for Fay Wray (Watt's uncanny, look-alike sister from another generation) and co-star Bruce Cabot (RKO Pictures, Inc., 1933; Turner and Warner Bros. Entertainment, 2006). With a little imagination, however, something of an 800--um--8000-pound Simian variant of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, loosely smattered with critical themes and elements from Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" (1308-21), lurk beneath the surface--just don't tell the ape!Ann Darrow's (Watts) unfaltering devotion hews the beast--and us. Once a tortured, hungering soul, she emerges from her descent into the abyss free and awakened, having overcome her mortal fears and personal demons. She has ""bared"" her soul to the sinister vagaries of a fickle existence in two jungles, tapping into a heretofore-unknown reservoir of courage to placate a lumbering beast. She amuses him with a smile, a dance, and a tear, and after an icy, nighttime romp through frigid Central Park, shows him the Way--a solitary, spiritual journey from the Circles of Hell to Paradise through Purgatory that is fraught with obstacles, temptations, and unimaginable punishments. None proved worse, however, than Kong's shameful abduction, with which she relates. Shackled against nature's will and voyeuristically exploited for others' entertainment, Kong is tormented by a faithless substitute for Beauty since Ann will have no part in this deception. Doom is the ultimate destiny for Man and Beast, but it is their only hope as well, just as the gods intended. Ann's journey, however, will detour along a dubious path, in an unlikely encounter with Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), always the object of her refined affection. Divine intervention worked through the most profane of men, Carl Denham (Black), ensnared Jack into Ann's existential journey. When others would have left her for dead in the woods or waters of Skull Island, Jack tenaciously searched for her. Eclipsed by Kong and shadowed in his wake until the Beast's catastrophic fall from grace, Jack never gave-up on Beauty, not as someone Ann Darrow could love. Like Dante's Beatrice, at whose request the philosopher, Virgil, interceded to guide their ascent into Paradise, Kong's attraction to the ""mourning"" star brought Ann to the pinnacle of her dreadful world and, in the darkest hour of her bereavement, Jack arrived in time to lift her to the stars.And you thought King Kong was the ultimate B movie."	5.0	"""Mourning"" Star"	2006-12-02	5	1	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AW99SBGWEXP0J	Michael Zuffa	"Carl Denham (Black) is a filmmaker who wants to get his film made.  The problem is that creditors are after him and he is missing a leading lady.  Ann Darrow (Watts) is an out of work actress who stumbles across Denham's path.  When she agrees, they make a hasty retreat to the ""Venture"", the ship that will take them to the filming location.  In the process, he manages to strand screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Brody) on board.  Soon, they ae heading for Skull Island.Once there, the filming begins, only to be interrupted by the natives, who have a tendency to remove the heads from their victims.  Ann is offered up as a sacrifice to the dominant male of the island, a big ape by the name of Kong (Serkis).  Instead of killing her, he develops a crush on her.  After a long chase on the island, we go back to New York for the fateful ending.""King Kong"" is a good movie, full of action, special effects, and heart.  Serkis gives Kong a realness that has not been seen before.  The action is tense and unrelenting.  Black and Brody do good jobs as their respective characters.  Watts shows she can act convincingly with a green screen.  The biggest drawback to this film is the running time.  At over three hours, ""King Kong"" is at least an hour too long.  This is not an epic tale, despite getting the epic treatment, and the film is hurt by it.  Fans of Peter Jackson (and there are many) will no doubt be thrilled by everything in this movie, and for them I recommend this film highly.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"No one could have possibly imagined just a scant number of years ago that director Peter Jackson, remembered prior to 2001 for his low-budget horror pictures, would become the highest paid director in motion picture history? Or, more importantly, that he himself would be in charge of a nearly three-hundred million dollar budgeted major motion picture remake of the classic Merian C. Cooper monster movie, King Kong, from 1933? Peter Jackson would scarcely believe it himself if it were not for the fact that he is indeed living the dream. It is funny how things work out the way they do. A proper re-imagining of the famous stop-motion animation special effects extravaganza has been in the pipeline at Universal Pictures for quite some time, waiting for just the right script and the director to helm to come along. Sure, there was the Paramount Pictures take on King Kong in 1976. And while the film did manage to scrape ninety-million dollars worldwide into the kitty, the presence of Kong himself, basically makeup artist Rick Baker in a laughable monkey-suit, failed miserably to do the original justice in any sense of the word. Now, one-billion dollars in box office ticket sales and three Lord of the Rings films later, director Peter Jackson sets out to prove once more that nothing has ever nor will ever top nor equal the magnificence of Kong, the eighth wonder of the world!The story for King Kong (2005) is undeniably reflective of the epic style of the 1933 original motion picture, a successful invocation of nostalgia on the part of director Peter Jackson who with this adaptation even surpasses the emotional intensity and high adrenaline rush of his Lord of the Rings series. With that said, King Kong regrettably has its fair share of flaws. The first one-third of the story is spent on bringing all the main characters of the film together onto the S.S. Venture destined for Skull Island. This portion of the picture is a bit slow to say the least but it allows audiences to become familiar with the personalities of the characters and set up the eventual confrontation with the dangers of Skull Island. The second section of the film, a majority of which take place on the island itself, is what truly makes up the movie. However it does stagger a bit as it draws closer to the final one-third of the picture leading the actions on screen to become repetitive and clich&eacute;d. The last one-third of the movie in which Kong as a captive is brought in chains to New York City and goes on a rampage in search of Ann, leading to the final confrontation on top of the famous Empire State Building, is unquestionably the worst part of the film, though far be it from a total wash. As soon as Kong is captured on Skull Island and brought to New York City, the drama and intensity of the film begin to seriously go downhill from there. Regardless, there are quite a number of memorable moments in this portion of the film including Kong sliding across the frozen river with Ann Darrow and Jack Black delivering the infamous line, ""It was Beauty that killed the Beast"", which just leave the audience awe-struck. It feels as though Jackson rushes the events leading up to Kong's death and his fall from the Empire State Building onto the street below which in effect severely diminishes the anticipation and the emotional anxiety that led up to this moment in the film.Naomi Watts is positively delightful in the role of struggling actress Ann Darrow who is recruited by motion picture director/producer Carl Denham to star in his adventure film and is then captured by the natives of Skull Island to be offered as a sacrifice to Kong. Like Kong himself, we the audience are entranced with her attractive appearance and sympathize with her life and desires early in the picture. King Kong will likely open a lot of doors for Miss Watts which is well deserved for the range of emotions she exhibits in this film. It is to be expected that few, if any really, took the casting of comedian Jack Black as Carl Denham in the Peter Jackson remake of the classic monster movie seriously at first glance, but he definitely silences his doubters. Black brings a certain amount of bitter humor and sarcasm to the role of a swaggering movie producer whose penchant for greatness is so excessive that he ends up destroying the very things he believed so strongly in. It is still a little difficult to accept Black within a dramatic role entirely but this should certainly help. He doesn't make the transition from comedy to drama as easily as Adam Sandler did with Punch Drunk Love but certainly no Jim Carrey either. And Adrien Brody is alright as Jack Driscoll who seems to all but disappear in the final hour of the picture. He works well as the everyman's hero and the foil to Bruce Baxter, the Hollywood action star who in reality is nothing more then a coward.However, the best performance in the film is given by Andy Serkis. Not for his role as Cookie, the cook of the S.S. Venture whose demise on Skull Island is particularly gruesome to witness, but rather for his behind-the-scenes portrayal of Kong himself. What was done for Kong was similar to what Serkis did for the creature Gollum in the Lord of the Rings series. He was strapped with a special suit with sensors attached in specific places in order to capture not only his movements but also his facial expressions. Besides being one of the most realistic and distinguished computer animated creations in recent memory, Kong is furthermore one of the most emotionally grappling characters in the film, filling you with terror and excitement one moment and the next having at the verge of tears. Serkis simply does a positively phenomenal job at retaining Kong's wild natural instincts early on in the picture while at the same time slowly integrating subtle human-like characteristics into the role such as when Kong throws a temper tantrum like a little child when Ann refuses to amuse him any longer after he has knocked her down several times.Overall, Peter Jackson's King Kong is truly a rare motion picture event that can honestly be defined as an epic in every capacity of the word. As was the case with the original, King Kong is far more then a monster movie. From beginning to end, Kong dazzles and amazes you. Terrifying, entrancing, and saddening, Jackson's reinvention of the classic 1933 film is one of the few remakes in recent Hollywood memory to actually do justice to its predecessor and in some areas even surpass it. This said however there do appear to be some issues with the film. The source of these problems may reside with director Peter Jackson's success following the lucrative Lord of the Rings trilogy and how it may very well have gone to his head, albeit unintentionally and unconsciously of course. Prior to Lord of the Rings, Jackson worked with what he had and that was that. However, with King Kong, post-LOTR, he has a nearly indefinite budget and unlimited resources at his disposal. Jackson's ability as a director to judge what should or should not be included in the finished product may have inadvertently been diminished because of this. He himself has admitted that there are hours of material not included in the final print of the movie which begs the question of what was left out of the film. There are scenes in King Kong, a majority of which appear in the second act of the movie, that are exhilarating but do nothing to advance either the plot or the message of the film.Regardless, the action sequences and the impressive computer animation effects which accompany them are what truly make up this picture. The special effects, though not entirely pristine, are awe-inspiring. From the moment the characters set foot on Skull Island the action is nearly non-stop. This however can border on the excessive, particularly during the second portion of the movie more so right around the part where the crew of the S.S. Venture plummets down a chasm filled with man-eating giant insects. Anyhow, a majority of the action sequences do work effectively. One scene in particular in which Kong proceeds to toss Ann Darrow from paw to paw as he battles three tyrannosaurs at once will literally have you gasping for air and clutching the edge of your seat. It is just that intense. There are few additional sequences like that, but why spoil the surprise?Parents with younger children eager to see Kong rampage his way through New York City however should strongly be cautioned because unlike the original 1933 King Kong film, or even a significant portion of Peter Jackson's own Lord of the Rings franchise for that matter, the gore, violence, and intensity of this adaptation are set onto overdrive throughout the entire picture which can be quite unnerving for children after three hours spent in a darkened movie theatre. Let's face it. Kong himself is an intimidating figure as it is. Throw in carnivorous tyrannosaurs, rampaging brontosauruses, creepy-crawly insects, gigantic spiders, man-eating razor-teeth sponges, and the ugliest, spectral natives you will ever lay eyes on and this is the stuff nightmares are made of. And, judging by the material in this film, there is enough to make them sleep with you in your bed for at least the next month.And as much as composer James Newton Howard should be commended for taking up the arduous task of rescoring from scratch the entire three-hour motion picture event King Kong after Howard Shore and director Peter Jackson parted ways on the project, what he delivers in the film, albeit far from what can be described as a disaster, is nothing memorable. From the same man who brought us unforgettable scores from The Sixth Sense, Signs, and the NBC television drama ER, this is a pure disappointment, but not one which can entirely be placed, if at all, on his shoulders. Regardless of its fault, Peter Jackson successfully achieves his goal of bringing his own distinct vision to the King Kong legend while at the time paying reverence to the dignity and superior quality of the original motion picture on which the remake was based. Hollywood would do well in taking notes on this film as it demonstrates firmly how a remake should properly be made."	4.0	The Moose Hole - 'King' of the World!	2005-12-21	6	3	3

The spectacular special effects, characters you care about (I love the relationship between Jimmy and Mr. Hayes, Denham and his assistant) and of course the wonderfully poignant and tender friendship of Ann and Kong.  Another thing I love about this movie is Jack Driscoll's bravery, he is relentless in his pursuit of the woman he loves and after she loses Kong she realizes that Jack has gone to enormous lengths to find her, how could she not reciprocate his love.  Adrian Brody is great in this role as is the beautifully expressive Naomi Watts.  I love everything about this movie including the opening scenes of 30s NYC, the shots of the vaudeville circuit and the animals, I didn't feel it dragged the film down, neither does the ship's journey to Skull Island, the scene where the fog surrounds the ship as they near the island is extremely creepy.  All of the prehistoric creatures are amazing and frightening and the island/jungle itself is remarkable.  My favorite scene probably is after Kong's triumphant battle with the T-Rex's and he sort of shames Ann into running after him, he finally picks her up and puts her on his shoulder, it's as though he's thinking, ""after all I've done for you, you try to escape from me, hmmmph!""  This is a wonderfully engrossing film with characters you care about.  And the musical score is lovely too.  As Ann and Kong would say, King Kong is beautiful..."	5.0	Beautiful...	2006-06-26	9	6	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1K2OHYVFYW52K	Midwest Guy	"I watched the Extended Version with my family last night on Blu-ray.  Effects and sound quality  and visual effects are great it is a good film but not the best Kong film made.The effects dominate the movie over the story and in the end make this less than a classic rendition of a classic story.  What would have made this a five start film and a classic for all times would have been better focus on the story which goes deeper than the ""Beauty Killed the Beast"" theme that does stand out.  The Skull Island sequences could have been about 25 minutes shorter so that 25 minutes could have been used to develop the story better. Most of that part shows the men out to save the girl getting beat up many more times than needed.  The story is not about the men looking for the girl, yet there are five separate moments where the men get run over, charged at, swallowed alive, and swarmed by bugs. All nice if the point of the story was to highlight how hard it is to save a girl.  But since it takes so long to get through the Skull Island portion, other important theme development gets a short shift.  As soon as the ape is subdued, we fast forward to opening night of his performance in New York. So much is left out from this point forward. The fact that the girl refused to play the role of the sacrifice at Kong's opening in New York is only briefly mentioned as if an afterthought. Why did she refuse?  Of course we all know because we know the story, but it is still important and gets completely left out. The older versions of this movie spent the time to make the audience feel the emotional attachment between the girl and the ape. They were allowed to feel the irony that while they should hate the ape, instead they feel for the ape and instead see that humans are the real evil.  That is the story.  But Cameron leaves all that in the dust and what we are left with is a visually stunning and special effects driven feature film that is very shallow and superficial.If the special effects were anything less than stunning, this film would have been a campy failure.  But because the effects are so darn good, this film gets by with the over the top gore and the poorly told story. It is a shame because this good movie could have been so much more."	3.0	Kong is King, Cameron, Not So Much	2011-03-21	3	1	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2SXGE7QAO5T7M	"Migzilla ""TMM"""	The story of King Kong is awesome.  As a fan of cryptozoology, I ask myself, would I have preferred they leave Kong alone (aside from rescuing the lady, of course)?  Or would I prefer they bring him to America so that we can all behold him?What happens when we discover Bigfoot or any other legendary animal?  We'll be happy for a while and excited, but it will eventually become boring without the mystery.  Then again, wouldn't we all want to know?  I always appreciate thought-provoking movies that make me ask myself such questions.Skull Island was a place untouched by time and technology.  We didn't know anything about it and so we assumed it didn't exist.  Ah, but it did exist.  Are there any such places out there?  We assume not.  Otherwise, we would already know about it, right?  There is no doubt many places out there we know nothing about (though it's anyone's guess as to what types of animals are to be discovered in such places).I liked the original very much, but I felt this remake was far better.  King Kong's size was consistent in this version.  Skull Island and its inhabitant were far creepier in this version as well.  And Jack Black, though I'm not a fan, was great in this movie.I didn't care much for the long King Kong vs. Dinosaur fights.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3R36DZQEWNVJ1	Mike Bolts	Jack Black (School of Rock, High Fidelity) stars as Carl Denham, a director who has found a map to a place called Skull Island. He assembles his crew, he hires a captain and his ship and he hires a beautful Ann Darrow, played by the beautiful Nicole Kidman look alike Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr., The Ring) and they go on a voyage to find this mysterious Skull Island. They arrive there not knowing what's going to happen but then they meet the natives....scary looking natives who kill some of them but they flee. The natives eventually come back and kidnap Naomi Watts, bring her back to their place and strap her down so that she can be sacrificed to KONG, who is a massive Ape. Black, his crew and Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Jacket), who plays Jack Driscoll, go off with the captain and his men to go rescue Watts from her awaited doom but she is taking into the jungle by the Ape and suddenly Kong becomes lost in her beauty. The hunt continues as the rest of the gang faces great perils, dinosaurs, lizards, nasty looking bugs to try to resue Watts. Jack Black wants to capture the Ape and they do by cholorforming it. They bring Kong back to Manhattan where Kong becomes King Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World but Kong then escapes causing more havoc, breaking out in the streets, climbing building...he even throws blonde woman away as he tries to find his. Then we all know what happens, King Kong climbs the empire state building with the blonde girl, airplanes come and so forth. Peter Jackson triumphs making it a welcome tribute the to the original one (which is still good by the way), with an excellent cast despite some cheesy effects...an example being the longneck dinosaurs pursuing the resue party. This blows away the Jeff Bridges one too (which was god awful and even more god awful when they put a crown on King Kong's head in that one). It's long...yes, but that creates story and we get to know the characters more better....enjoy it and if you cant, well then you're just a crab apple. Also starring Colin Hanks (Orange County), Kyle Chandler (Tv's Early Edition), Jamie Bell (Undertow, Billy Elliott) Thomas Kretschmann (Blade 2, The Pianist), Evan Parke (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, All My Children) and Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, 24 Hour Party People) who plays both King Kong and Lumpy.	3.0	Peter Jackson's vision of King Kong	2005-12-29	6	2	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2ZX5079G6KROH	"Mike J. Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian"""	I was prepared for this to be lousy and it was. But I didn't expect itto be lousier by far even than the Dino De Laurentis Opus of 1976.I'm convinced Academy Award Winner Peter Jackson can't really direct atall. Lord of the Rings was wooden, empty, barely plotted and inhuman.All the Ring's backgrounds were phony Computer Matte and they suckedand made the story look like a cartoon. It didn't help that he reducedhis Rings characters to cartoons too.The same problem exists in King Kong. The actors don't have a thing todo with one another. They act in a vacuum, as if they're not sharingthe same movie.The new version was supposed to be a paean to the original 1933 Kong.It is set in the thirties. The computer matted skull island sketcheswouldn't convince an eight year old. They stink. Then there are thejurassic park-like dinosaurs. This section is so phony, they would haveimproved the movie by simply cutting every bit of it out. The Kongfigure is not great, nor even as moving as the 1933 Ape, but theGorilla is so much more realistic than the dinosaur figures he fightsthat they have no business being in the same fight with him.A good Kong will have a human response to the Fay Wray character, butthat is never managed. Kong the character is awful. A permanent exileto New Zealand for Jackson is called for here.Seventeen members of the Venture crew who look for an eighth wonder ofthe World on Skull Island die. Two of them include a black guy wholooks like the late Jackie Robinson and a white kid, who is readingHeart of Darkness in preparation for the assault on the island. Thereading and the relationship of these two characters is supposed toundercut the extraordinary racism of King Kong. All the Kong moviesborrow from Heart of Darkness and its aura of Black Voodoo and racism.The black guy is killed by Kong, and the kid too. It doesn't matterthat they are, because the strange friendship between these two isfinally meaningless.The screenplay, co-written by director Jackson, is not careful aboutdetails and story points. For that failure alone, King Kong is a ruin.At one point a bunch of aimless dinosaurus are stomping through thecrew members of the Venture, even stepping past them, but never killingany of the principals. Its as if they're not really chasing them at allafter awhile, just stampeding downhill WITH them, due to the steepnessof the mountain.The blacks on Skull Island are carefully coiffed, corked and paintedwith varieties of appliances and makeup never seen before on any blackfrom Africa or the US. This is a gesture of political correctness: Ifthey look nothing like American or African blacks there can be no raceissue, right?Later, when Kong is performing on Broadway, a typical set of AmericanBlacks do the usual Jungle Movie mumbo-jumbo around Kong and the girlthey've gotten to replace Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts). Watts is wasted inthis film. She is one of the best actresses working, but the only realacting she manages is early on, on stage, as a member of a fadingvaudeville group.The Depression scenes in Thirties Times Square are mostly fake computerstuff that the real actors walk around in. The differences in filmstock are obvious to the audience. Like Anthony Quinn, the bedouin kingof Lawrence of Arabia, the audience looks in vain for somethingauthentic. I notice the thirties computerized New York stuff is basedon Norman Rockwell paintings and famous Life and Look Magazine photosof the period. Its just terribly obvious. The art direction on Kong isa jokeKong is supposed to have a human relationship with Ann Darrow, andDarrow is supposed to have a relationship with the screenwriter playedby Adrien Brody. That is never really accomplished. So here's Kongdragging Ann Darrow up the Empire State Building to face six World WarOne Sopwith Camels that look suspiciously like the one used to drag theUniversal Sign around the World in Universal movies of the thirties.Times Square and other locales are dotted with Universal ProductPlacement that are supposed to be seen as clever. This movie is theopposite of clever.Jack Black is cast as the down at the heel producer who puts the madventure together. He is made up to look like the young director OrsonWelles at about the time he made Citizen Kane. Mostly Black plays thecharacter as a mad scientist, his entire face often filling the screenwith a diabolical look that rarely changes. Watts has her two frontteeth chipmunked to make her resemble the Piper Laurie of programmersmade for Universal with Tony Curtis in the early fifties.The movie is three hours long. Even Kong's death scene on the EmpireState drags on too long. There is a reference to RKO pictures in earlyscenes as a bad film company. But it is RKO that made the originalKong, a movie that in 1933 WAS the eighth wonder of the World.Universal has never been nor ever will be the equal of RKO.	1.0	Send Peter Jackson Into New Zealand Exile for this Monstrous Kong!	2005-12-27	24	10	14
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AAR7NW23LWV5E	MikeNM	This movie had the potential to be an excellent movie.  It updated the old King Kong with all the modern film-making techniques.  The camera work, the special effects, etc. were all brilliant.  The acting was easily above par.  Someone, however, in production, needed to edit out some things.  Most of the too-long movie was made up of scenes of King King running around, etc.  Almost every scene was just too long.  The movie-makers need to learn to get the plot moving, and cut out the rest, especially when a movie like that is going for so long.	3.0	so-so	2006-05-20	5	4	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2228B4OVTYKMZ	miller stevens	"Yeah, you'll give me a ""this review was not helpful"" rating, but I don't care. This bombastic, over-indulgent piece of mis-directed, poorly written drivel is one of the best examples of how super-ego and super-budget does not equal great movie.Let's start with the visuals. The visual effects are absolutely appalling. I've seen art students with mac minis and copies of maya do a better job. I am speechless at all the people who talk about the visual splendour of this film. It's amateurish and makes me think of 80s Harry Hanussen movies. The blue screen stuff is pitiful.Next comes the lame script. Here we go with formula guys: Act 1 (1 hour) getting to the island. Cliched set-ups of  cliched characters. Act 2 (1 hour) on the island. Endless chase scenes with animals and scene after scene of impossible physics. That Ann isn't killed a hundred times over is impossible. But hey, it's a movie. Act 3 (1 hour) getting back to New York. This is the only part of the film I liked, but even that was choppy.The acting is okay. I actually think Jack Black brought something to his role. Naomi Watts and Brody walk through their scenes. There's no depth here, folks. Doesn't anyone remember how great Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange were in the 70's version?Finally, the direction. Peter Jackson does not understand tone. This is why all his movies before Lord of the Rings (where the tone was dictated by the content, which was an adaptation) did not work. Have you seen them? Frighteners, Heavenly Creatures, Meet the Feebles - all interesting movies but the tone is off. Same here. Is this a comedy, a drama, an action film? The cliches make me think he's going for B-movie matinee stuff, the dramatic scenes make me think he wanted epic, the gross animals stuff makes me think horror. Can't a movie be all? Yep, but when you look at something like Jurassic Park, you see that they can work together seemlessly. Not here.In the end it's poorly executed potboiler mash and it's disconcerting that so many critics and viewers have lapped this up. If we don't start expecting more, this will be the benchmark and filmmakers just wont have to try any harder."	1.0	A new low for film making	2006-04-15	49	27	22
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AUSATFDSU2INS	"milss ""Yellow hair warrior"""	The genius Lord of the Rings director, Peter Jackson, pays homage to his all-time favorite film. Special effects and jaw-dropping adventure make the new remake of King Kong a success in its genre.Adapted from the original story and placed evocatively in the original 1930s, the new Kong also expands the story, giving us new plots and adventures on the expedition, as well as details about the Depression, Broadway and the vaudeville worlds.The result is a dazzling, but very long movie. At three hours and seven minutes, King Kong provides us with the most astonishing special effects ever put on celluloid. Of course, the many moments of action and emotion help propel the stunning spectacle.Though visually stunning, the new Kong isn't totally perfect. Jack Black and Adrien Brody roles were, to my opinion, catastrophically miscast. The first one can't seem to escape his comedic expressions and shallowness, while the second one is just plain boring and depressive. Still, there are enough treats in KK to divert us from wallowing in these not so forgettable mistakes.Three memorable performances give heart and warmth to the film, including Naomi Watts as the heartbreaking Ann Darrow, and Jamie Bell as the sweet offbeat kid Jimmie.The third performance is Kong himself, a character recreated for the computer by Andy Serkis (Gollum in LOTR). Kong is a marvel of emotional expressions. He moves and leaps with boundless energy, he jumps easily onto cliffs and buildings, and easily fights dinosaurs at once. He can show passion for Ann Darrow and then provoke in us the same sadness his eyes portrays once he's taken from his world.Besides Ann, he's one of the other deep characters in the film, and even without a single line to utter, this creature surprisingly has the depth to move us emotionally to the point you just want him to get the girl, in spite of the river of differences that divides these two kindred spirits.	4.0	King again	2006-01-18	3	2	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"""King Kong"" is the umpteenth remake of the 1933 film that starred Fay Wray as a starlet who wins the heart of a wild giant ape, leading to his destruction at the hands of civilized men. Peter Jackson directed and co-wrote this 2005 version of the story, which takes advantage of major improvements in visual effects technology over the past 70 years to create a giant ape whose emotions are more recognizable and sympathetic than in ever before. In Depression-era New York City, Carl Denham (Jack Black) -filmmaker, profiteer, con artist, and ""preening self-promoter""- has worn his financiers' patience thin with his extravagant vision for a romantic adventure film. They pull their financial backing, and Carl absconds with his footage, determined to shoot his film on a legendary remote island -legend of his own making. He spots Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a struggling vaudeville performer, on the street and thinks she would be a fine leading actress. Ann signs on only because her favorite playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) is writing the script. Cast and crew set sail on a cargo ship captained by a German named Englehorn (Thomas Kretschmann), a trafficker in exotic animals, ostensibly bound for Singapore, but actually in search of someplace more sinister.""King Kong"" is a film in 3 or 4 acts, depending upon how you count. The first and last take place in New York City, as Carl Denham pulls his cast and crew together and, finally, when he brings ""King Kong: Eighth Wonder of the World"" to the public. These segments are terrific. Jack Black lends Denham the right amounts of humor and unbridled ambition, and the city anchors the film in the real world. The discord and intrigue on the ship as it sails for anywhere exotic, dangerous, and far away from authorities is also interesting. But most of the action in ""King Kong"" takes place on Skull Island, where all manner of monster live and thrive, including a fearsome  25-foot gorilla that the native humans call ""Kong"". This is where we get to know King Kong and watch the intrepid filmmakers burn a lot of calories evading huge, hungry, computer generated beasts. Some of this is good, but there's too much of it -to the point of camp. The giant bugs sequence would have been better omitted, for example, as it's ridiculous (intentionally) and holds up the main storyline to no purpose.That said, the relationship between Ann and Kong is terrific. Kong's emotions seem real. His eyes aren't quite life-like, but they're trying to be. ""King Kong"" wouldn't be as good without its superb supporting cast, so I want to mention Evan Parke as the philosophical veteran ship's mate Mr. Hayes, Colin Hanks as Preston the sound man, and Kyle Chandler as vain leading man Bruce Baxter. The entire cast does a great job of bringing credibility and humor to a story of man-eating monsters and a besotted gorilla.The DVD (Universal 2006 single disc): ""A Volkswagen Touareg and King Kong"" (2 min) is a behind-the-scenes look at filming a VW Touareg commercial. We also see the commercial. ""See More of NTC: Wish You Were Here"" (1 min) is a trailer for a short film that you can see on seemoreofnyc(dot)com.

Lot's of Thrilling and Adventurous scenes with Dinosaurs, Bugs, and Parasites eating everybody.The Special Effects were very Realistic.This film should have been rated R because of to many Violence and Gore,A 16 or 20 year old could handle but a 9 or 10 year old couldn't.The movie is not only to full of Bloody scenes but it also has Animal Abuse in it. for example: the NY people Torture and abuse King Kong in the film when they find him. and then at the end of the film King Kong Dies with pain.The Woman whom was captured by Kong was always Crying And weeping every time she saw King Kong Die or being tortured. which was to long and to common.when they already captured Kong I was already crying.This film can only be watched once and that's all, because it is so sad that it's like watching a car accident ect ect.Overall, I Loved this film with the special effects and the Beautiful Carnivores Ripping thing apart. and then comes Kong.First Rent it before buying it.	4.0	Sad Story, Good movie...	2011-08-26	1	0	1

So, I thought that a bigger and better version would be cool, something interesting to watch, even though I was iffy about Jack Black playing the director.  I doubted him.  I shouldn't have.  I loved, loved, LOVED this movie.  The fact that they took the time to make Kong an actual character in the movie, with emotions and fears and heroism....wow.  I have been trying to finish the movie, but (spoiler) knowing that he dies in the end so far away from where he was from without understanding the why of it all...I can't do it.  What can I say, I have a big place in my heart for animals.But truthfully, the monkey (Gorilla?  Ape?) made this movie.  I made it to the part where the two of them (the woman and Kong) were sliding on the ice, and lost it.  The missle came down and blew into the lake, and the rage and fear that I saw in his face...I turned it off.  But, I can honestly say that it was extremely well done.The special effects in the movie were amazing, the bugs almost looked real as did the dinosaurs (what can I say, we know they weren't, right???).  The natives scared me.  And, the love story wasn't cheesy.  I enjoyed what I could make it through.Watch this one.	5.0	Couldn't Finish It...	2006-06-02	6	2	4

What really killed the film experience for me was its length.  After watching it in the theater and then again on DVD, I was as disappointed as the first time.I will give the director his dues for production values - the special effects are extraordinary and his direction spot-on.  The fact that he was able make the relationship between the woman and Kong plausible and emotional should have earned him more credit.Otherwise, the movie's alright.  At 3 hours, a lot of the film could have been cut (an EXTENDED version coming in November?!...) especially the (too) many staring sequences between the two.  A lot of the action was cool looking (the Kong and Rexes sequence is amazing) but some of it was totally unnecessary (the insect sequence grosses me to this day) and made it longer than it should have been.While I know that I am one of the few who aren't praising the film completely, there are merits to it and it deserves to be seen just because of what he accomplished with the relationship.Otherwise, it's just another Kong film.	3.0	King Kong - A Masterpiece?	2006-03-28	6	3	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A39T22PM64B189	"M. J. Kramer ""kttl421"""	When it comes to King Kong, the movie is well, the King. Peter Jackson's flair for the dramatic and his detalied action secquences are top notch. Obvoisly, the gigantic ape was CG, but the way it interacted with the imcomprable Naomi Watts was superb.Though the movie differed in certain areas from the original, it has only made the movie better in my opinion. The fact that Kong and Watts had a connection, as wierd as it may sound, worked! In the original, the blonde bombshell was more afraid of the beast then she was in this version. The story was somewhat in context of a beauty and the beast kind of setting.The scale and granduer used by Peter Jackson is amazing. I put him higher then good old Spielberg, Ron Howard, and put him more on the level of George Lucas. It sounds odd, but Jackson has the LOTR trilogy under his belt along with 11 Oscars. :) This film will surely fill his mantle if not full already.Once again, Watts was amazing. The way she depicted a struggling actress was flawless. She, in this version, was actually part of a somewhat love triangle with herself, Kong, and Driscoll (played by Adrian Brody), and she pulled it off. Mind you her choice at the end was easy, but still. The fact that she actually in my opinion, knew what Kong was trying to do as far protect her, and the fact that she cared in this movie made it leaps and bounds better then the original. THe little hand signals, the looks, everything was perfect and really caught the mood of the movie. Even towards the end when Kong was being bombarded, he cared more about Anne (Watts), then he did himself. This love story, as odd as it may be, is original, and awesome.Peter Jackson took this timeless classic, put a spin on it, and made it an epic tragedy/love story/adventure. When people talk about King Kong as a classic, they will undoubtably be talking about this movie. I personally saw it 3 times in the theatre, it was that good.The best part about having it on DVD, is that even though the movie is quite long (a little over 3 hours), you can pause it so you don't miss a beat.This movie can be summed up in one word...

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"Let's get one thing out the way:  ""King Kong"" ain't perfect.  In trying to weld the cornball tone of the original ""Kong"" with a more modern sense of gravitas, gifted director Peter Jackson and fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens found that they sometimes had to force fit the two.  No example is more glaring that the father-son relationship between the Venture's first mate (Evan Parke) and a cabin boy named Jimmy (Jamie Bell), who work hard to reconcile their often cheesy dialogue, and the strain shows.But in the end, that is just a minor nit-pick in the face of the most bracingly exciting and enormously entertaining movie of the year.  Peter Jackson has brought his dream project to life with enough soul, humor and smarts that far outweigh any problems that the film has.  Audiences will already know the plot before the first frame rolls:  An obsessive New York filmmaker named Carl Denham (Jack Black) cons a crew, a ship, screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) and down on her luck actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) to travel to an uncharted pacific Island where he plans to shoot his masterpiece.  Of course once the ship arrives, they find vicious natives who notice that Ann would make a perfect sacrifice to their native God Kong, who turns out to be giant Ape.  Kong makes off with Ann, eventually discovering they share a deep bond and the common enemy in the other inhabitants of the Island.  From then on, Jackson kicks into overdrive, barreling through one incredible action scene after another with an assortment of creatures that up the intensity quotient for all other fantasy and action films that are destined to follow in his wake.To say ""King Kong"" is spectacular is an understatement.  I can't think of another film this year that even begins to match the technical prowess and digital wizardry shown off by Jackson, cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, editor Jamie Selkirk and the miracle workers known as Weta digital.  The visual effects provided by Weta are absolutely staggering, both for their near perfect realism and exhilarating urgency.  From the stunning resurrection of 1930's New York to the beauty and terror of Skull Island, they sweep the audience to a lost world.  Oh, and their with Kong?  Sheer brilliance.  Working with Andy Serkis in a motion capture studio, Weta and Jackson have brought the Ape to life with equal parts fierceness and emotional depth, making Kong breathe with life.However, all the technical achievements in the world would not matter a bit if Jackson did not get the characters right.  But he did.  Jack Black proves a great bit of casting, playing Denham as he is: an obsessive, amoral weasel.  Adrien Brody takes the less relevant role of Jack Driscoll and has fun with it, giving off subtle humor and masculine confidence.  Naomi Watts is phenomenal as the struggling vaudville actress Ann Darrow who develops a deep, loving bond with Kong.  The beauty and the beast dynamic that was instrumental to the success of the original is just as prevalent here, and Watts and Andy Serkis as Kong make you believe wholeheartedly in that bond.  It is palpable, funny and ultimately tragic.  It is the beating heart of a film that reminds us of just how exciting and memorable movies can be.  Here's hoping Peter Jackson keeps making movies for a long, long time."	5.0	A Staggering Cinematic Achievement	2005-12-17	3	2	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1KAR9G699RM56	M. Miller	Well, I'd never seen any telling of this story previously until this one and I have to say...  I guess what I have to say is the story itself isn't nearly as interesting as I'd hoped because of the necessary belief on the audience's part that Kong must have deep feelings.  But that's about the Kong story in general, as opposed to the film itself.Regarding the film, the first thing that struck me was how good the special effects were, since Kong seemed so real.  (Ahh... cgi, you've done it again.)  The grandeur of the scenes, from NY to Skull Island and back again, were just amazing.  Additionally, this let Peter Jackson (director) include many quasi-chase scenes which I feel were shot very well, although when it comes to plot value I have to say the scenes probably could've been shortened a lot, quite a lot.Still though, I guess overall, the combined special effects with basic story still ranked together as an average, decently entertaining film.  I do not fault Jackson as story goes, and anyway at least I did not start snoring half-way through like one guy in the theatre did.  Then again, I wasn't whisked away with the film either, but who would want to go to Skull Island?	3.0	Great ape, great ape, great huge crazy ape	2006-01-11	7	2	5

Oh the joy in my heart when I saw that first preview as Kong contronts a T-rex to save his lady love.  Oh, how my heart sank when I heard it was over 3 hours.This is my main complaint with this film.  It's just too damn long.  Oh, sure, it's often in the name of character development, but I'm not here for character development.  I'm here for giant monkey mayhem!  And dinosaurs!But in this film, much of the monster action seems almost thrown in as a concession, as if Jackson would much rather get back to people talking or looking dramatically at things instead of dinosaur stampedes and t-rex fights.  Much of the dialoge is painfully heavyhanded, and while the characters are well-defined, they are also re-defined and re-re-defined needlessly.The action in this Kong failed to hold my attention.  That's beyond comprehension.  Ask anyone who knows me and they'll tell you I can sit and watch giant monsters films all day.  The only sequence that was exceptional in my mind was Kong's fight with three T-rexes.  That was amazing.  The dino stampede: good, not great.  Giant Bugs:  Almost seemed thrown in as an afterthought.  Kong running through the city:  Okay, but pointless.  Kong's final battle:  A foregone conclusion and drained of all suspense.Of course, some will say I'm just being old school, unwilling to accept this version on principle alone.  They might have a point, but I do know that this Kong was hobbled by a story that was already too familiar and a director who has started to take himself too seriously.  Kong is drained of almost every bit of fun, and wants to impress you with how deep and touching it is.And if that doesn't spell misfire for a giant monkey movie, I don't know what does.	2.0	well, it's not terrible	2006-05-19	3	0	3

But this movie was absolutely torture to sit through.First off, it's a CGI fest. Of course I knew that going in but I had a false hope that perhaps they would show restraint and use CGI skillfully.  I haven't paid attention but I hope this did not win any special effects awards.  The effects of this movie and those of its type are not artistry or cinematic skill, it's all a matter of computer technology being powerful enough to process and render it all.This has all the undesirable aspects associated with CGI.  It has the overly elaborate absurd action sequences.  People run under a stampede of dinosaurs always finding the right spot to avoid being trampled and a guy karate kicks a dinosaur as he jumps from the foot of a larger dinosaur.  We have outrageous falls and always something available and utilized to break the action and he used as a swing to further combative action.  Ordinary people are utilizing everything in the environment to do amazing feats.We also have the ridiculous shifting camera angles that seem so unnatural because they can not represent anyone's point of view.This movie is backed by a bland musical score.  The acting is equally bland and doesn't cause any identification to the characters.  To me this movie hinges on the identification of the relationship between Kong and the woman which was created so beautifully in the 1976 version.In this one, Kong is whipping the woman around violently.  So much so that her neck would have to be broken.  Kong also starts out displaying threatening intimidation and intimidating bullying of the woman.  The mood becomes like a kid's movie as the woman wins Kong over by juggling and dancing for his entertainment.I was also annoyed by the movie switching to horror mode with the natives being presented as witch type characters.The bulk of the movie is spent in CGI Jurassic Park mode with constant CGI dinosaur attacks and Kong/Dinosaur battles.  We also have multitudes of large CGI creatures attacking the other group of adventurers.As I should have expected but had hoped against, the CGI goes beyond over the top when giant insects are swarming on a guys head and body as he jumps around erratically.  His buddy then gets a machine gun and blasts off the insect attackers that are grasping him.This really had nothing at common with the groundbreaking film from 1932 besides ending as expected.  Despite recreating nothing worthwhile from the 1932 classic, it did decide to bring back the worst aspect which was the corny ending remark.  ""It was beauty that killed the beast"".It is so frustrating to constantly see such uninspired garbage being rated 4 out of 5 stars here on Amazon and making so much money.  It is quite scary to realize that the average mentality  of society is so low."	1.0	Awful CGI fest	2006-05-29	52	31	21

Breathtaking SFX, good acting, good story, and just about everything else you would expect in a Peter Jackson film. It takes some time for the action to pick up, but once it does it never lets up.

Many of the scenes extend and extend and extend to multiple endings, especially those involving action between men and beast(s) - interesting at first but get a bit old after a while. The story-line is limited and at times boring. Nevertheless, the beauty and beast connection is moving and the special effects are at times breathtaking. Unfortunately, however, King Kong does not come close to Jackson's work with The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

All that I heard about this movie was how awesome the fights are but they dragged on as badly as the rest of the movie does.  Jack Black is not bad playing an actual actor though he does not have a lot of range.  The thing that really set me off was that he has the final words of the movie and wtf, he ends up being the smart one?I hate to repeat something I have I have read on here about a hundred times but I must say it again, do not expect anything close to Lord of the Rings.

I'm glad the high action happened soon in the film.  I loved the stampede & T-Rex scenes although some of it seemed waaaaay too impossible.  Like, why would THREE different t-rexes go after one single chic when there are several other creatures to comsume?  Why would the first t-rex chase after her after it just ate the other dinosaur?  Anyway, we won't get into technical survival tactics cuz that will just make me sound like a discovery channel/animal planet addict.Some hated the scene where Jane & Kong are scooting around on the frozen lake but I loved it.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2I14B0RQ5JLPH	MovieFan	King Kong is the best film of 2005. Peter Jackson has re-invented Kong in a way in which we will never forget. The effects were astounding, breathtaking, and the best I have seen in a film since The Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson has taken us through an emotional and heartbreaking story of the true beauty and the beast. You will laugh, you will cry, and it will have an everlasting effect on you. The actors did an amazing job and Naomi Watts is at her best. Peter Jackson is the best filmmaker of our time and has created a glorious masterpiece.	5.0	King Kong	2006-07-14	5	2	3

I swear, this seemed endless. But the action scenes and the heart-stopping action made you think that the time had passed quickly. Now, about King Kong. Well, actually, I liked this better than Cooper's version. I mean PJ is a genuis! He added in all scenes from the old one in this and some new scenes. I mean he had the natives part, the stegosaurus part but replaced it with a Styracosaurus, he added in the brontosaurus stampede, he had the brontosaurus part in the lake but replaced it with a giant fish, he had the log scene over a 1,000 foot cliff! He had the T-rex fight but it was V-rex, a little diffrent. He took out the snake fight and replaced with giant bugs in the ravine. And Kong is taking to New York and you know the rest.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2XRZV63X79YSJ	"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector"""	I was looking forward to this film and just saw the film.  And let me tell you that I was disappointed.  I have a rule that films over 2 and a half hours, every minute needs to add to the story.  This film has an overabundance atmosphere.The first hour is one long exposition.  Nothing really happens, you get to meet the cast in detail.  It shows the depression and thirties NYC accurately but this is not neccesary for the story.  This should have been only 20 minutes.The second hour is Skull Island.  Again everything is overdone here.  There are some awesome special effects but they go on and on.  But here I do give credit to some of the best CGI I have ever seen.  About 90% of the live and CGI mesh perfectly to the point you cannot really tell that it is CGI.  The dinosaurs and Kong had depth and weight. Virtually every other film, the CGI never seemed real because there was no appearance of physical weight to the beings.  They seemed to be floating.  In KK they actually look like they are walking and running.Now with that said, I must go back to the point that much of the scenes here are overly long.  The scene where the raptors attack the brontosaurs goes on forever (I admit it was great but long).  The scene where the guys are attacked by slugs and bugs at the bottom of the ravine has absolutely no point other than to have more special effects.  Even the scene where Kong saves Naomi from the T-Rex's is incredibly overdone.  He kills each of the three T-Rex's at least three times!The best scenes are purely with Kong and the girl.  Naiomi Watts is great and this is the only time that I wanted the film to go on.  As a matter of fact, I wish the film was almost of Kong and the girl.The last hour was back in NYC and was actually just a little long but the story changes lessened the impact.If you want to see the best go back to the original.	3.0	Jackson Needs to Learn that Films can be Under Three Hours!!	2006-03-22	13	5	8

Is it better than the original? Well...In some ways yes and in some ways no. The connection between Ann and Kong,  which a lot of people had problems with,  is welcome, as it makes the story much more interesting and heartfelt. I think Jackson should be commended for his efforts and this could very well be his crown jewel! Both the original and this remake deserve to be in everyone's movie collection!The new extended edition is a worthy purchase as it has a lot of interesting added scenes that should have been in the theatrical release.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1NMUSODK9RHAT	Mr. Maybe	I'm a big fan of the original King Kong, but I never go into re-makes expecting it to compare to the originals, for better or worse.The bottom line for me is that this film was too long (for no reason) and had too many sequences that defied physics and plausibility to the point of diminishing an otherwise visually stunning adventure film. More is rarely truly more.Many of the action sequences reminded me of how someone who lived it would TELL the story, not how it actually happened (exaggeration for effect):Specifically, the idea of Kong Repeatedly falling down cliffs, fighting off T-Rex's, etc. all the while holding an unscathed Ann in one-hand seems a bit absurd. If it happened for only a moment, it might have some punch (like a close call.) But instead is happens for several minutes, yet she is never harmed, no backlash, nothing. Imagine getting into a car crash for 2-3 minutes and escaping unharmed. That's the same physics for these scenes.Another scene features the crew trying to escape a stampede of Brontosaurus', but the scene is so jam-packed with the creatures in such a small space, it looks more cartoon-ish than believable.Another incredulous scene features a young man who the filmmakers go out of their way to tell you has no experience with guns. Later, in the heat of battling giant inspects and larvae, he loads a Tommy gun and shoots giant crickets off his comrade, some 6-10 feet away. Not once does he ever hit his friend. Even in the hands of the most trained marksman this scene is a stretch beyond stretches.When Kong escapes into the streets of New York, all is pure chaos and non-stop madness. But the second he finds Ann (or rather, she finds him), the streets are suddenly dead quiet with no sign of destruction. Huh? I also had a very hard time believing that the crew could effortlessly track Kong on such a vast, incredibly dangerous-terrain island.There are many other scenes that defy logic and physics that really took away from them, when they should have been highlights of the film.As far as the length of the film - there were many scenes and sub-stories that seemed completely unnecessary or were totally unfulfilled. The story between Mr. Hayes and Jimmy escapes me entirely. It was interesting until one of them is killed, the other one cries and then you never see or hear of either again. Yet, we've spent approx. 10-20 minutes focused solely on them and their history. Why? It takes literally an hour to REACH the island. At 2 hours and 20 minutes, we finally reach New York. Don't get me wrong, once the action starts, it's pretty relentless. But you can't tell me in a story as simple as King Kong that there's any reason not to get this film down to closer to 2 hours, instead of breaking the 3-hour mark. I think I would be more forgiving if we were left with any sort of solace or payoff at the end, but it ends rather flatly (no pun intended.) I realize it's a re-make, but if Jackson is going to take liberties to build up characters and make us sit through 3-hours, there better well be a good reason. I never found one.Despite all the above mentioned, there were many aspects I did like. The realism of Kong having true gorilla mannerisms was great and it really lends to the viewer's sympathy for him as a wild animal, simply following trying to his instincts. For that same reason, I found the ending to be gut-wrenching, as well as his captivity scene. The action and visual effects are stunning and once they start, they don't let up. I really felt like I had been somewhere extraordinary when it was over.I thought all of it was very well acted, but unfortunately, there wasn't much of a reason to be. It's all action and the only emotion most people will feel is between Ann and Kong. I felt very little nothing for Ann and Jack's romance, which is too bad.In the end, I would recommend this film as a visual stunner and to true fans of King Kong, or fans of fast-paced action and adventure films (after the first hour, anyway.) If you've never seen the original, or aren't interested in the concept, there should be no problem in skipping it.Lastly, I would NOT recommend it for kids. It has some scary moments and the theme is too mature for most kids to understand anyway.	3.0	Mixed feelings, but closer to a miss than a hit (*SPOILERS*),	2008-08-01	3	2	1

The computer animation was probably done by bunch of young guys who grew up playing video games, don't even drive cars and know very little of how objects move in the real physical world or simply don't care because they want it to be as exciting as the video game worlds they grew up in. In the old days, they made over-the-top musicals and these days it's over-the-top animation. Also, the CGI just doesn't look real (it never does) but the whole thing is processed in a kind of drab blueish hue to try and meld reality with the CGI world and it just looks murky to me.

I'm not liking the stylized, digitally rendered world of modern movies, and this is the epitomy of digital moviemaking.Where to start? Why watch this movie?Do you like digital monkeys fighting several digital dinosaurs for fifteen minutes at a time? To lighten things up, every now and then for emotional gravitas, a shot of a passionately concerned Naomi Watts who is in love with a large, killer monkey makes for a good laugh. This monster is killing people, you two don't make a good couple, enough with the theatrics. In the original, the woman is terrified, and she should be. At this point I'm dumbfounded by the movie. A fat Jack Black is jogging under a dino's belly while carrying a large, depression era movie camera. No, I'm not exaggerating or lying. Him and several other people are running under the belly of a dino. If it wasn't ridiculous enough, it looks like a videogame. No realism in the look or the actions of the people. And to make it worse; some sort of strange made-for-tv blur effect, that is completely out of place with the production style and is used at some of the strangest times.To be honest, somewhere in the middle of the island scenes I went out for a breath of fresh air and to listen to some music in my car. I missed how they catched the large monkey and how they managed to drag it to NY.Oooops, I almost forgot to mention the most inane set of throwaway characters in film history; The Men of the Boat! If the entire boat sank midway into the film, not a single amount of concern would be registered by the filmgoers. But the ultimate throwaway character is The Boy Who Can't Read. He is reading ""The Heart of Darkness"". What is great about this - is when bad acting young boy asks shipmate about book, it provides metaphors for Jack Black's obsessed character, which is actually providing metaphors for monster ego director Peter Jackson. This was done so clumsily I laughed out loud several times, ""Why does he keep going up the river?..."" now I'm getting looks from the audience; nobody gets my humor!Even Andy Serkis, he of Golumn fame, gets in on the act. From voicing/acting Golumn to this throwaway character, what next, spokesman for Wal-Mart? Oh, the end? The monkey and annoying wanna-be actress get married and have three darling little apes, who grow up to run the family business. But really, you want big sweeping shots? Great, can't stand a screen-full of CGI? Tough, you're going to get big old sweeping CGI scenes. No dust, grain, or any sense of reality - you're watching a rendered scene for you to respond with rendered emotions. Digital shots of digital monkey. Cut to; Naomi Watts in horror as her 1,000 pound digital lover kills left and right. Its all so touching.In closing;* Nice Depression Era Intro* Throwaway characters* Jack Black miscast* Overdramatic Naomi Watts (enough with trying over and over to create sympathy for Kong!)* Strange blur effect and editing choices* Scenes on the island over the top to the point of being ridiculous. Hanging from the mouth of a raptor during a fight taking place hanging from vines??? Huh! Then the running of the dinos and it only gets worse from there.* The rescue of Naomi from Kong and the capture of Kong both ridiculous. The hero climing up a cliff-face and later him jumping off said cliff with her, etc. Apparently being a screenwriter give one superhumans powers.* The whole over the top, sweeping digital ending.I'm in my 30's - I'm the only one in my group of friends who braved this movie. Never heard much about it - Kong seemed to disappear from the map quickly and deservedly.As much as I liked the LotR series - I would be unlikely to bother seeing a Peter Jackson movie in this lifetime."	1.0	6 hour video game with no redeeming moments	2006-11-03	55	14	41
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AL4KX6X24YSS	MurphysLaw	"Peter Jackson may have tried to one-up himself in this remake of King Kong, but he didn't suceed.  The movie isn't exactly bad, but it isn't exactly good either.  The first part of the movie dragged on and on.  Kong finally shows up, Naomi Watts screams a while and he drags her through the jungle yet leaves not a scratch.  Oh look, he's smitten by her.  She is fine with this and even performs a little vaudeville act for him.  Oh he's laughing. Isn't that cute?Oh here comes the hero, scrawny Adrian Brody, to save the day.  He can find her even though no one else can.  He can climb up a huge mountain cliff, unharmed by the countless dinosaurs and giant bugs that everyone else had problems with.  After all he's a writer so he is used to mountain climbing and fending off giant killer creatures.Wait, did I say dinosaurs?  Yes, dinosaurs inhabit the island with King Kong.  There are countless dinosaurs and only one giant ape but of course, he's fine.  No one messes with Kong.  Oh wait, spoke too soon,  here come the dinosaurs...three of them.  Everyone wants Naomi, it seems.  Kong wouldn't dare put her down or she might get hurt.  It makes much more sense to hang on to her and fight with only one arm.  Of course, she is left without a scratch again, even though she was smacked and tossed about and her head was whipping around like a kite in a hurricane.  No injuries though.  Kong should sell car insurance.  Dinosaurs are destroyed.  Too bad Godzilla wasn't there, he would have showed him.  Then again, the dinosaurs didn't really do much damage to the tiny humans that they tried to stampede either.  This ain't no Jurassic Park.  Hey, didn't I see that same special effect in Lord of the Rings?  No, that was a giant elephant thing.  This is a dinosaur...completely different.Uh oh.  They've captured Kong.  Off to New York with you.  Oops, he's loose.  Carnage in the city streets.  Pandemonium.  Death and destruction.  Awwww, there is Naomi.  Silence.  Their eyes meet.  Love is rekindled even though she is guilty of getting him in this mess in the first place.  Here come the planes!  Climb up to the highest building you can find.  Naomi looks fetching in her white flowing gown.  It doesn't matter that it's winter in New York and there is no wind atop the Empire State building.  It's balmy and nice here in Kong's giant paw.Adrian is huffing and puffing up the stairs to save the day.  He won't get involved in the least but he'll take the credit and grope the girl in the end.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1Q1V4F9610DB5	Music Lover in Omaha	This film delivers what it is suppose to deliver:  FUN.  This isn't serious drama, this is cartoon type fun.  Jack Black was terrific as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody was okay as the hero and Naomi Watts was great as Ann, the beauty loved by the beast.  That said, the star of this film is the giant ape and a wonderful job they did bring the beast to life.  I did not care for the scene on the frozen pond in New York.  That really was dull and contrived, but the rest of the movie moved along well and it did not seem three hours long.  The supporting actors were also very good, including the cameraman, the captain and of course the male movie star.  Was it better than the original?  Well, I loved the original and I was prepared to be disapointed by a remake.  I was not however.  If only all remakes could live up to this standard.	4.0	Do away with the ice pond and it's 5 stars	2007-08-21	3	1	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AZV0ZRCDU5NK3	Mykl	"This movie is absolute garbage. I know coming of LOTR, the next film was going to be an up hill battle for Jackson, but I had some faith. When I heard he was going to Kong, I thought why waste your time, Kong is a classic case closed. This film confirms that. There is nothing, NOTHING good about it. The acting is bad, the screenplay was horrible, the FX shots were lame, the directing was too frantic at times , and the action was overbearing and LONG at times. Don't get me wrong, the first half with the characters' background being established is good, the big inside joke/reference of the first film's director (whose name escapes me) and Fay Wray, it gave me hope that from what I saw in the previews that the movie wasn't going to be that bad. I was wrong, once they get to Skull Island, meet Kong, and get back to NY... from that on out TRASH!If anything could have saved this, it would have been the prospect of the film being turned into a 2 or 3 part movie. The first could have been how the map gets into Jack Black's chubby fingers (which Black is still a HORRIBLE ACTOR), the second could have been about Kong and the other dealings of Skull Island, and if they were to have done a 3 parter, the last could have been about Kong in NY,The absolute worst thing is the FX! Just trash. The effect shot with Brody and Black between the running dinosuars' legs is so bad, but not as bad as Kong himself.Kong looked as fake in the previews as he did in the final film.And the prize for worst FX shot in this trash goes to when Kong falls and hits the ground, there is NO IMAPCT SITE! NO CARS OVER TURNED, NO DUST IN THE AIR OR ON PEOPLE, THE CITY STREET IS NOT BROKEN UP AT ALL, NO WINDOWS IN STORE FRONTS OR CARS BUSTED OUT FROM THE IMPACT OF A WHAT 30 FOOT TALL APE WEIGHING WHAT 2 MAYBE 3 TONS!All in all this was one of the worst times at the movies I have had in a long time. The best part was the previews for Miami Vice, and The Inside Man.And I know some people might say: ""Why did I go then?""

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AK9LN821QYQG9	Neal J. Wertanen	"A very faithful remake, this new Kong has only a few subtle differences in the main story as its '33 counterpart. Mainly that Jackson takes alot more time to tell everything, and set everything up. It does take awhile to get to skull island and to the title character, but the film ends up being alot better as a result.Jackson opens the movie in ""Hooverville"" in Central Park during the depression and gives us small glimpses at what life was like during that time. We meet Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts in an outstanding, oscar-worthy performace)performing stage comedy before her theater is closed down, and all her close friends disband, leaving her alone and unemployed. We meet Carl Denham (Jack Black in a mad-scientist type role) as he is about to lose funding for his latest feature film, and his deliberate conning of everyone around him (including Ann, and screenwriter Jack Drischol, played by oscar winner Adrien Brody) to get off to sea and basically steal an opportunity to strike it rich. He has this look in his eye during the whole movie that suggests he's a little psychotic.They finally arrive at Skull Island in what seems to be fate (I'll let you see what I mean), and they barely survive a first encounter with the natives on the island, who are portrayed alot more hostile and violent in this version than in the previous 2 versions...but I think it works alot better. The natives kidnap Ann, and tie her up and put her out for Kong to get. And then the big man arrives.The look of this entire scene will stay with you for along time. Its dark, and red and orange and just very creepy and unsettling. Kong arrives, and you really only get blurred glimpses at him until he gets into the jungle, and when you do finally see him your absolutely convinced he's real, and not a CGI creation by Weta digital. The amount of detail on him is amazing, especially in his facial expressions. He IS a real ape, and a real flesh and blood character!!!I mean you look at him and he has personality, a soul... a CGI character who obviously has a soul!!! He is great. He has a lazy eye, scars, and a re-healed, slightly crooked jaw. I mean he has traits! He's somewhat childlike when he plays with Ann. He throws tantrums, he laughs for the wrong reasons, he has expression and wonder about him. He's curious about her, and you can tell he's really trying to connect with her after awhile, but its hard. And not just because he's and ape, but because he is so utterly, miserably alone.And all this is good, because the movie hinges on this relationship between Kong and Ann, and both Kong and Naomi Watts are amazing in this capacity. Its mostly unspoken, all the acting going on (with both of them) in the eyes and expressions, and it is magic. It is amazing, and very very touching and poignant. You understand why Kong would fall for Ann, because Jackson films her so beautifully, and because Naomi Watts is an amazing actress who had better at least get nominated for this performance. It is something special.Moving along now, Skull Island brings a faster paced movie for along time with Dinosaurs and creepy crawlers everywhere. Nothing can prepare you for how amazing and thrilling watching Kong fight off 3...yes 3 T-Rex's to protect Ann. It is incredible, and beyond words to try and explain. Then comes the moment where Denham realizes all he can do to try and save the mission and his reputation and to not go to jail is to capture kong.It is a really sad and emotional scene. Jack ""saves"" Ann from Kong and he pursues them to the natives village where Denham has a trap waiting. Ann begins to realize what they're going to do and your heart starts racing. You care alot more about Kong than Denham or any of the other people, except Ann, and your heart just brakes in two watching them attack Kong when all he wants is to get to Ann, who he thinks is in danger. She cries and pleads with them to stop and leave him alone, but the giant ape falls and his eyes meet Ann's and she looks away in pain and shame.Course all of this is nothing compared to the finale, which is so much more emotional and sad and well done in Jacksons version. Kong runs amok in NYC trying to find Ann, who finds him first and he runs into Central Park holding her in his paw. He slips on the ice, and begins playing with Ann, spinning around in a beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking scene. Its so adorable, the connection these two have, and you believe every second of it. Its beautiful, but also heartwrenching because we know whats about to happen, we know the fate of our beloved ape-friend. And although we're happy at this quiet moment of happiness that Kong enjoys just before the climb, it makes watching it even worse.The moment is disrupted suddenly by a tank blast onto the ice where Kong and Ann are, and Kong scrambles to get away and to protect Ann, and he leaps onto the rooftops and towards the empire state building and his doom. Personally my eyes never dried up during the last 10-13 minutes, because its so sad how they treat him. He gets to the top of the Empire State Building and looks over the early dawn sunrise.The clouds tell you what is coming, the sadness, the tragedy. Kong touches his chest as he looks out, and mouths silently something, but Ann realizes he's immitating what she herself did on Skull Island earlier. She had looked out over a sunset, and touched her own chest and said ""beautiful"". No sooner does Ann tearfully smile and say to kong ""yes...beautiful"" then the sound and then the images of the Bi-planes arrive and Kong begins growling. Ann realizes what is happening, and so do we. Its fate, its unavoidable. Kong lowers Ann to a safe spot and gets to the very top so they don't shoot at her. Ann climbs up and futily tries to stop them, but its too late and humans are too hateful of what they don't understand. Kong begins to slip, and grabs Ann one last time and the sad, lonely eyes of the mighy King meets Anns eyes for the final time. He puts her down and his eyes go blank and he falls.Denham closes the picture the same as the '33 version; ""It wasn't the planes who killed him...it was beauty.""This movie is epic in everyway. Its amazing, thrilling, well acted, and very emotional. It shows the best and worst of humanity, and its told to us by a 25 foot tall ape named Kong. Its a movie that shouldn't be missed, and that will become and remain a classic for a long, long time."	5.0	Epic retelling of an american classic.	2005-12-15	0	0	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3A64289GZHBQD	neotroglodyte	One of the most compelling and engaging platonic love stories to illuminate the resplendent plane. What could be more archetypically heroic than the two protagonists atop the Empire State willing to sacrifice his/her life for the other?On another level, Mr. Jackson renders a rather cynical (albeit accurate) view of humanity; greedy, perfidious, and brutal.The film amalgamates action, sci-fi, horror, and romance masterfully...quite an accomplishment. Jackson had been ruminating on this story (the 1933 version being his favorite film) for most of his life, and it shows.An imperfect masterpiece that dwarfs the 1933 classic. Truncate the first 40 minutes and the excess in the insect pit...perfect.	5.0	Trans-Primatial Love	2010-07-28	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AP5NXS66INNOB	newyork2dallas	"I've never seen the 1930 or 1976 movies, so I had nothing to go by entering the theater except Peter Jackson himself -- the director who brought The Lord of the Rings to the big screen in an excellent adaptation that stayed true to the core of Tolkien's tale. If anyone can handle remaking Kong, Jackson can.The verdict is simple: Peter Jackson is officially the Michael Jordan of directors. NO OTHER DIRECTOR could have achieved this monumental creation -- a three-hour tale full of action, adventure, fear, love, fellowship, betrayal and poignancy. Is the movie long? Yes. Does it have TONS of special effects? Yes. Is it excessive? No. Here now, the good, the bad and the ugly of King Kong.The Good: The acting. Jackson's decision to secure A-list quality actress Naomi Watts for the crucial role of Anne Darrow pays off HUGE. Watts' interaction with the immense gorilla is excellent -- indeed, I did not want to leave my seat when the two were on screen together because the development of their relationship and her reactions (from fear to gratitude to friendliness to love) is among the better acting work you will see. Remember -- Watts had to do all this in front of blue screens or Andy Serkis (6-foot tall, not 25+ feet tall) in a literal monkey suit.  And Jackson demanded more than just screaming on cue gawking in a particular direction (e.g., Jurassic Park).  Instead, he wanted her to fully interact on a variety of levels with an enormous, violent and inscrutable beast and she hit every note.Additional kudos to Jack Black, who works the sleazy showman angle nicely without overplaying it; Adrien Brody as Watts' love interest who is smitten by the simple decency of Darrow and overcomes his initial haughtiness as a self-important playwright; Thomas Kretschmann, the German actor who plays the Captain of the tramp steamer Venture and does a fine job balancing his hard-bitten captain persona with a patina of heroic chivalry; and Evan Parke and Jamie Bell (the title character in ""Billy Elliot"") who put a new twist on the mentor and protege relationship in an homage to the 1930s-1950s templates (the twist = a black mentor for the white protege in 1930s America).A special note for Andy Serkis, the career character actor who has donned the movement-capture suit to play both Gollum and Kong. Serkis did a fine job with the Kong movements, and had a memorable cameo in his own right as the irascible ship cook of the Venture.More good: the effects, naturally. Jackson is simply better than any other director at making his effects seem real, although there were two uncharacteristic hiccups. The Depression-era NYC sets were fantastic; ditto the tribal village on the mysterious island. The screenplay, too, was solid. Credit the writers with NOT writing what need not be written.  Watts' Darrow barely speaks with Kong, yet they have tremendous communication. Jackson's direction hits its high points here, as does Watts' acting, while concurrently avoiding the usual trope of human speaking to beast, which becomes inane as the actor or actress just ends up talking to him/herself.Best of all -- KONG. From happy to sad to defiant to angry, the computer effects captured everything and did an extraordinary job. You see his intelligence, his love for Darrow, his concern for her safety, his jealousy, and more. Best of all (although saddest of all), his confusion and despair when he tries to find her in NYC. Great stuff.The Bad: a short list here. First, audio looping failed to catch about 3 or 4 times when Watts' natural Australian accent slipped out. Second, the Bell-Parke relationship may have been stretched. Third, Kong doesn't appear until 70 minutes into the movie -- some of the earlier chaff could stand a bit of pruning and a trimming of about five minutes here and there on the Isle of Kong wouldn't hurt. Fourth, and perhaps least important, two shots over the bow of the steamer when caught in a storm look fake.The Ugly: Jackson does a great job of capturing the depravity of man, both during the immediate return to the US after Kong's capture when the great gorilla is made into a Broadway spectacle that a full house cannot pay enough to see, and after the great beast's fall.Some notes: (1) King Kong, the origina 1930 version, is the movie that spurred Jackson's interest in movies; (2) catch the reference -- at one point showman Carl Denham is looking for a star for his movie because ""Maureen"" the lead actress had run out and he needs someone who can fit into her size 4 costumes. He runs through actresses with his assistant: Myrna Loy, Mae West and ""What about Fay?"" ""No she's doing a picture for RKO with Cooper."" Fay = Fay Wray, Cooper = Merian Cooper and RKO is the studio that put out the original Kong.Ultimately, the payoff is so huge that the buildup is worth it. Jackson's reputation is etched in granite at this point."	5.0	Fine work once again by Jackson	2005-12-28	7	4	3

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A16IXZW2A0NFR6	NIVEK	Peter Jackson is an impressive filmmaker indeed. The King Kong story is not a very involving one, at least I never thought it really was, not until now. Jackson's new film is vastly superior to the original and the crummy 70's remake. This film has a heart which is rare to find in a popcorn film such as this. The acting is very impressive and the special effects are astounding. The films length didn't bother me really, I didn't find it boring at all. A good movie for some great adventure scenes and for a surprisingly emotional relationship between Kong and Watts.	4.0	Better Than It Should Have Been	2006-01-25	6	5	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AOO3LOPY6IBY8	N. Lessig	Given the level of creativity and the seamless implementation of WETA's effects, I expected much more from this movie than a long overdrawn saga.  The story was okay, but hindered badly by the poor integration of live-action and cg.  I mean, the compositing was just plain lousy and the movements of the large creatures weren't scaled well at all.  I was so distracted during the scene in which the characters are running from the herd of brachiosaurs (or whatever they were) by the obvious fakery of the images that I couldn't see past it.  Better effects were achieved in the original King Kong.  I don't expect to see this kind of crap on screen when it comes from the same people who were behind LOTR.In short, King Kong was overhyped, overbudgeted, underproduced and overall underwhelming.  The best example of integrated cg in a film is still the first film to use the technology:  Jurassic Park.  Let's hope that Peter Jackson decides to take on something less classic and less demanding on the audience.	1.0	GARBAGE!!!	2006-07-03	21	11	10
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2T0L6RPRVP3UC	Nobody	I'm not going to critisize the plot of the film because it ultimately adheres quite closely to the original 1933 Merian C. Cooper version of the film. However this film is 187min long and in order to fill this extra time it digresses into silly nonsense for large portions of the film.  A problem I had was that while watching it I was constantly being reminded of other films like `Jurassic Park' (Dinosaurs share characteristics) `Apocalypse Now' (one person is reading Heart of Darkness)  `Lord Of The Rings' (Villagers mannerisms are similar to Gollum) and `Titanic' to name a few. Another problem I have is with the cinematography, which is just too colourful for my palette. Of courses there is an unnecessary excess of CGI in this film. There was a time when special affects were used in films to create the illusion of reality now special affects seem to be used to make things seem unreal. We can easily sit now and point out what is CGI and what is not and besides some of it is so appallingly bad it's hard to miss, the dinosaur stampede especially. As for the attempt to develop a relationship between Ann Darrow and the 25 ft ape, it is completely laughable.I had high hopes for the Lord Of The Rings trilogy and was disappointed so I wasn't really expecting much here. For me Peter Jackson's best two films will always be `Bad Taste' (1989) and `Brain Dead' (1992). I prefer the original King Kong over this boring nonsense any day.	2.0	Too long...needs editing	2007-01-16	14	4	10

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A4FG1EZ8FBOFA	"Nova ""Pierre"""	"When the highly anticipated ""King Kong"" first hit theaters, i remember a lot of critics and friends saying it was a "" great "" movie. However within the first 3 weeks of it's release those endorsements declined pretty rapidly, which i thought was strange for such a big budget special effects spectacular. And then I saw it ....This movie sucks. By the end of it was wondering if the monkey had the right idea by taking a dive. It feels incredibly artificial and it's WAAYYYYY too long. It's 3 hours of cinematic overkill and rehashed plot lines that feel a lot like deja vu. The first hour we are introduced to all the 1920 period characters on a boat ( a la Titanic), who all have some history that plays no part in the last 2/3 of the movie. The second hour we finally meet the ape, but also about a dozen or so other dangerous creatures, including dinosaurs, which they must fight off in the mysterious lost jungle ( a la Jurassic park) and the last 45 minutes, or so, we get the beast running rampant through out new york until the military catches up ( a la Godzilla).The saving graces are the scenery, the special effects, and Kong himself, who is the most impressive and believable character in the whole thing. Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody couldn't save the schlock-fest, and Jack Black just seemed out of place with his contemporary squinty eyed manic antics. This is a case where less ultimately, would have been more... like at least 45 minutes less, about 5 story lines less, and less cheap-shots at sentimentality. By the way, I have never seen the lakes in central park freeze hard enough to support a 5 ton ape."	2.0	Save the Ape, kill this movie....	2006-04-16	15	7	8

Peter Jackson's wit - absent without official leave for the Lord of the Rings trilogy - is back, and this time he has a leading man who can act. That this  leading man is a computer generated ape doesn't reflect poorly on Elijah Wood so much as it reflects inestimable glory on the genius of the folk at Weta Digital - having watched brontosauruses tumbling hilariously over each other, and T-Rexes snapping greedily at Ann Darrow from a cat's cradle of tangled vines, it is clear that DreamWorks, Pixar and Industrial Light and Magic all have some catching up to do. The effects-laden jungle sequence is long (as it is in the original), but it is directed with such panache, and is so funny, that only a curmudgeon or a cineaste would think to complain - and cineastes have no place in a theatre showing King Kong anyway.If I had constructive criticism for the DVD edition it would be to chop rather than augment this time - the ""Heart of Darkness"" sub-plot (which eventually fizzles) and a couple of the minor crew characters could be dropped without significant loss, and I thought Driscoll arriving on the top of the Empire State Building and getting the girl disrupted the emotional tie that Jackson had carefully constructed between Kong and Darrow. Driscoll needed to realise he would always be second fiddle, and comport himself to a monastery.But this is minor stuff.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A28VU1V0YFRY8J	Once Upon A Time	What a Beautiful & amazing movie! Naomi Watts is absolutely breath-taking!  This is now my all time favorite besides Batman Begins, Pearl Harbor and Titanic!This remake of King Kong has so much heart, so much feeling, so much passion! I saw it a third time just today. This is, hands down, the BEST motion picture that I have ever seen in my life! It was AMAZING! So thrilling! The acting was incredible! The characters have such depth! The special effects are magnificent!  The musical score by James Newton Howard (Batman Begins) is amazing! This movie was pure entertainment with so much heart! I looked around & didn't see a dry eye anywhere.I have to say though, I think Peter Jackson may have fibbed just a tiny bit. He said that this remake is solely inspired from the 1933 classic that he loved so much staring Fay Wray. Well, in that version, Fay Wray was terrified of Kong from the moment she was sacrificed to Kong until the moment he was killed. It was Jessica Lange that started the caring for Kong thing. So I think the 1976 version inspired Peter Jackson more then he's letting on.This incarnation of King Kong is the absolute best though! It's just phenomenal! Two Thumbs up to Naomi Watts! She was brilliant in this movie! You could totally feel the bond that formed between her and Kong! She was amazing! What an incredible and wonderful movie!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	3 hour Christmas movies will probably be Peter Jackson's slot for as long as he gets a budget and camera into his hands, something the Jack Black character, Carl Denham, in Kong wants to do by shipping his unsuspecting crew and cast to the mystery Skull Island where he believes he will film the last place on earth that man has not been, kicking off a somewhat violent and horrific adventure that pushes its PG-13 limit to even shock adults, but in a fun sort of way, King Kong as Horror works, as it was meant to have been, bringing us a startling Skull Island incident, coupled with a daring rescue mission that turns into a quest for Kong, seeing this epic on the big screen is the reason why widescreen movies where invented, you will be hard pressed to recall a better thrill-seeker be it on DVD or in the movies in a long a time. Although Kong may seem a little akin to Jurassic Park 2: The Lost Word at times or dips into melodrama more than once to score one with the bleeding hearts in the audience, nowhere else will you see fight sequences that last for up to fifteen minutes, one after the other, as Jackson attempts to bring silent movies back into the fray, and does it ever so well, literally there is no dialogue as the artist uses the canvas to tell the story, you will be thanking him wholeheartedly for reintroducing us to what cinema was meant to be. Of course no one will be surprised by the ending, will still be eagerly awaiting the final reel, and what a final reel it is, special effects like you have not seen special effects before, Kong simply stomps its competition into the ground and then roars for more. Don't relegate your chance to see it now by waiting for home theatre. This is what Movie crowds are all about!	5.0	Going Ape in NYC	2005-12-17	0	0	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AHOLIHT1HLOG1	Panda Opa	You would expect more out of Academy Award winning, Peter Jackson. But it seems we were expecting too much. The film is visually stunning. It's worth seeing just for that reason. But the overall film suffers in many areas, resulting in a mediocre remake.First of all, the casting was bad. Often the actors are very out of place in their roles, even though they give good performances. Some of the selections are very peculiar, Jack Black for instance. Very strange, although he is quite good in his role.It has some memorable moments, but the majority of the film is boring and pointless. It seems Jackson feels the need to make every movie as long as possible, and the film really suffers because of this. Even with the strange casting, the film still could have been great. The length is what really knocks it down a level. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a 3 hour long movie as much as anyone else, but the extra length was pointless. It didn't add anything to the movie.As I said before, it's worth a watch for the special effects. Just don't go in expecting an amazing film.Rating: 2 1/2 StarsThank you for your time.	3.0	Visually Appealing, Way Too Long	2006-06-08	14	10	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1OUSWBGI0UJ34	Paris Stachtiaris	"The Extended Version of ""King Kong"" is a better movie than the theatrical one released in 2005. The two scenes put back from Skull Island should of never been deleted in the first place! They added excitement and tention to this movie. My main problem with this version is they didn't add MORE deleted scenes back to help explain some of the gaps left in the original theatrical film. For example, the extended scenes on the boat work better ,and makes us CARE more about the characters ,and why some of them risked their lives to save Ann Darrow. This part of the film still suffers because of poor editing choices. It's a shame that Mr. Jackson didn't take advantage to fix this problem. Still ""King Kong"" is a good film ,and I recommend the Extended Version over the original one."	3.0	King Kong Misses The Boat....Barely	2006-12-17	2	2	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1BA72K4VK1UN1	"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster"""	I harbored monumental hopes for this film when I learned that Sir Peter Jackson was finally going to get to make it. I was especially excited to hear Sir Peter comment in an interview that the originalKing Kongwas his favorite film of all time because it's one of mine as well. Clearly, this actuality would have inspired him to do a great job on his own interpretation... but, Alas! I fear that this production snowballed and got away from him.This epic-length film reflects the work of many of his formerThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)comrades. He brought along quite a bit of the production crew (as well as some actors) for the ride and so it was natural that *Kong* was produced by much the same process... lots of blue-screen insertions anticipating special effects.To encapsulate the matter, that's my chief criticism of the movie -- it has just way too many special effects. I found myself *enduring* and not enjoying the near-endless unlikely dinosaurs-chasing-screaming-people [and similarly redundant encounters] scenes. From my view, Sir Peter had forsaken the idea of artfully directing these otherwise skilled actors to carry the core story, reserving the special effects solely to punctuate their artful performances. In this instance, the renowned Director has thrown in everything but the kitchen sink and I wouldn't swear that it didn't fly past as well. It was all just too much and I think that Sir Peter's approach significantly diminished this potentially superb adventure yarn.One facet of this movie in particular that I wished to remark on was that the characters under assault seemed far too capable of absorbing punishment by the various critters and other disasters, and still somehow [by numerous miracles?] survive. Kong gave this little gal pretty rough handling and I'm compelled to observe that the first squeeze he gave her would surely have done her in. Yes, it's a fantasy movie of a sort but one still cannot mentally deny the laws of physics and/or biology while attempting to absorb this sort of escapism film.This leads me to my third [and final] point: Sir Peter's *King Kong* yields up an excess of what he intended as *humorous moments* [vignettes of Gimli!] and he obviously chose cast members who could effectively convey this technique, given a quality script. So the approach here was much the same as what we encountered inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Single Disc), another even more unfortunate film production. *Kong* takes the original Fay Wray film and tacks on a one-liner to most scenes. I viewed it all as an aggregation of distraction and mis-spent effort.So, I didn't like the film; however, many others will enjoy it to various degrees. If I haven't provided adequate specifics for you to decide, it might be best if you simply rented it first. Or, you could do what I did and buy it at Big Lots for three bucks! I'll soon be passing my copy on as a minor gift to some appreciative young person.	3.0	Earl Kong -- notably less than a King!	2011-07-25	5	2	3

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AXHWQ834G3IUV	Paul D. Sandor	If you missed King Kong at the theaters, here's your chance to catch up. Peter Jackson's version is easily the best of the three Kong epics. The film (DVD) begins slowly, builds up with furious action in the second act and concludes with a breathtaking finale. It feels like three seperate films, but somehow works as a singular vision. The acting is first rate and nearly matches the intensity of the action. King Kong doesn't quite reach the unmatched level of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's close enough to guarantee the viewer an exciting evening of escapist entertainment.King Kong is divided into three distinct parts (acts). The first act focuses on the characters' back-story. And while Jackson has done this before (the flawless first half of The Fellowship of the Ring), his effort here is slightly erratic: too many ideas, not enough precision. Twenty minutes of editing would have served the film well. It is here we are introduced to Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts). Ms. Watts is brilliant. Sure, you'll remember Kong, the special effects and the deluge of action, but it is Ann Darrow who will steal your heart. Naomi Watts is tops among the new crew of beauties who can act (Jennifer Connelly, Charlize Theron, Angelina Jolie etc.). Jack Black, Adrien Brody and the rest of the cast shine in performances that have somehow been overlooked (Lord of the Rings backlash?).The second act takes place on Skull Island. The action here is ripping throughout and one will find it hard to breathe during some of the spectacular sequences. There are dinosaurs,hostile natives, scary bugs and Kong's introduction during this section. There is also action, jaw dropping special effects, beauty in abundance and still more action during this sixty minute roller coaster ride. The DVD is worth owning for the second act alone.The final act gives the film(DVD) and its audience a chance to breathe. It focuses on men and their greed/ignorance, the Technicolor brilliance of NYC at night and the events that lead to King Kong's inevitable doom. The final act is where humanity and technology intersect. Watts says more with her expressive blue eyes than the lines she is given. Kong-- in a real triumph for special effects-- matches her emotions with the sadness conveyed in his CGI brown eyes. By the time the planes zoom in and reduce The Mighty King Kong in both size and relevance (incredible cinematography) as he is perched precariously on the Empire State buiding, the audience is ready for the end of the film. Sure, three hours is long time to wait for a predictable ending...but it's worth it.	4.0	Third time's a charm for Kong...	2006-03-30	0	0	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2RXN42B892W51	Penman Broke	"I agree with the reviewer who said: ""just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.""This movie begins well.  Naomi Watts is refreshingly subtle and the other cast members seem good.  The story gets a little muddled at times, but no worries, there's always the special effects to carry the movie.  Ah yes, the special effects.  Those ever growing special effects.  Bigger and badder than Kong himself.  In the beginning, they are used well to take the viewer back in time.  But once the story reaches Skull Island, forget the story and any sublimity; it all gets overdone.  Way overdone.  But as in cooking, in a photoplay you have to know when to let up.  You can't suddenly dump a bucket of chili powder in your tomato sauce to make good chili.A light hearted adventure movie with great possibilities for scenery and reasonably fantastic creatures suddenly turns too menacing, with impossibly bleak occult and action scenes that no one would live with or through.  In a lesser example, my wife and I were laughing at all the guys who stayed on the log to get shaken off by Kong in a gloriously overdone rampage.  You gotta be smart to be believable.  People being chased don't stay on short bridges if they can help it, especially if someone has gone to the trouble to hold the line so they can escape.Like so many action movies today, one feels the movie makers are trying to keep up with the giant amusement parks.  They need to take us to the imaginary, but also show a little restraint on the effects and keep it human, even develop the human relationships a little more to have a better balanced movie.  For instance, Ann and the writer on the boat--they mutter about in a couple of short encounters and then are suddenly in love.  They never have a real conversation.  At least have them standing on deck, leaning on the rail and looking at the sunset and discussing his play or something.  A counterpoint to the later sunset scene with Kong.Oh well.  The cast members were good and Naomi Watts was rightly cast in Fay Wray's role."	2.0	typically overdone adventure movie	2009-10-02	4	2	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2TYAL88IXRSEV	Peter Prainito	Before I get started, I find it very interesting that so many reviewers are knocking the length of the new King Kong, yet they've written reviews that are longer than term papers!Here goes:The 1933 original is a classic landmark film for it's time. Though very primitive special effects were available at the time, one cannot help admire the excellent screenplay.The 1976 remake should be trashed. Just terrible in every sense. Only good thing about the film is Jessica Lange. Kong looks like a guy in a costume, especially the way he walks upright like a human being.Peter Jackson's 2005 remake is excellent, but not perfect. The film captures depression era New York very well. The CGI is a marvel, Kong looks very real. The highlights for me were: the way Kong and Ann related, a re-telling of Beauty and the Beast; the way he tenderly held and touched her; how she slept nestled on his arm; the Central Park scene where Kong was slipping on the ice, NOT skating...a stroke of genius; and the climax atop the Empire State Building. What could have been toned down was the amount of prehistoric creatures (a little goes a long way). The insect scene added nothing to the film, and should have been cut. Finally, the battles between Kong and the prehistoric creatures, though impressive and thrilling, really moved way too fast for the eye and brain to focus on and capture. This seems to be a trend in Hollywood these days. Directors, please S-L-O-W  down the action scenes a wee bit so the audience can actually enjoy what they're watching. Recommended popcorn movie.	5.0	King Kong Trilogy.....A comparison	2005-12-19	4	3	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1DXP76EMJONGE	Peter Svochak	I absolutely LOVED this remake. I was a little dissappointed at how fake the CGI looked. But then I realized this was done by Universal and we all know how abyssmal Hulk was. But King Kong (the origianl 1933 version) was the movie that put the moviemaking bug into Peter Jackson's head. So this movie was a lifelong dream-come-true for him.The ONLY complaint I have about this DVD is the fact that it does not include a director commentary. I don't know about anyone else, but I love hearing a director's comments and thoughts. I love hearing what was going through his head when he made a particular scene. That's the only thing that would have made me give this DVD 5 stars.	4.0	What? No commentary?!	2006-03-29	6	4	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2S1TF4OD00K53	"P. G. Keller ""Packerfan75"""	Most people knew the story and how it would end but it's never been more saddening as we've never been made to care for Kong so much. Personally, I love animals and it tears me apart when I see or hear of them being abused (Michael Vick, you deserve your punishment, if not more). So knowing the tragic fate of King Kong actually kept me from seeing it in the theater. That was probably still a good choice as the end really pulls at my heart strings. Don't get me wrong though, I really like this film and it's obviously really well done if it can make me feel so much for an animated, oversized gorilla.I won't bother with the plot as most everyone knows it by now. I'll focus on the HD DVD disc which is why your probably reading these reviews anyway. Too many review the movie and never speak of the disc quality, which I know bugs me a little.The video is breathtaking, especially once the characters arrive on the island. The jungle scenes are truly alive and really pop in the way you hope a new hi def disc will. The graphics and animation by WETA (who also did Lord of the Rings) are top notch. They blend almost perfectly with the scenery and the details allow you to really look at them and appreciate how good they really are. You can tell they're graphics but it doesn't hurt the enjoyment or believability at all. My favorite things to look at are Kong as you can inspect every hair, scar, and skin texture in their amazing detail. And during the attack in the insect pit. These tube like creatures reveal this wet, slick, fleshy looking texture to them. I never stop being amazed by how real that looks.Audio wise, we get a very robust Dolby Digital Plus mix. This disc packs a wallop that'll knock you across the room during the action parts. The dialog and score are perfectly balanced and sound great too, but I always look forward to the action bits and this one is everything you could hope for. I found new demo material here with the Kong/T-Rex fight. Not only a sight to behold but a sonic wonder for the ears. The audio puts all the growls, roars, thumps and crashes right in your house(given you have a home theater of course). It's truly relentless and exhiliarating to the point of exhaustion by the time it's finished. Great stuff.This is one of the first films you need to get for your HD DVD player. If you don't have home theater, this movie will inspire you to consider it as it's as much a sonic marvel as a visual wonder. And all of this is only bested by a wonderful story and excellent acting. The audio and video must come second to these but it's all the better to have them all here. Overall, this is a wonderful film and is what I believe to be the best adaptation of King Kong ever. The question is, knowing the outcome, can you make it to the end?	5.0	The Beautiful Tragedy	2008-01-10	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3S0IVFM83ZSE7	P. Hardy	"Being someone whose been in family whose seen almost every ""King Kong"" carnation on film (From the original, the really bad, To ""Mighty Joe Young"" staring Bill Paxton, and the laughable 1970s remake starring Jeff Bridges among others), one would be safe to assume you've seen it all. . .But you haven't see a King Kong remake unless you seen Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 Film. And what's great about this film is that all the characters (from the minor to the major) all have relationships with the other unlike old film and the remakes. I saw this movie on opening day, I came in on Jack Black's character trying to persuade his peers to allow him to direct a documentary film with the biggest star they could find (If memory serves). I wasn't expecting to be dazzled by the movie despite the director simply because of its Source material, but I got a real surprise out of this film entirely. Jack Black plays a convincing, manipulative director, Carl Denham who is accompanied along with his assistant Preston (Colin Hanks) - who is weary of Denham's idea to go ahead with a film his peers are obviously against. Along the way we are introduced to struggling ""actress(?)"" Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) who is saved from potential jail time by Denham's quick acting and is then offered the chance of a lifetime to star in Denham's illegal docufilm. Using what means he can, he manages to get everything he needs abroad a ship, including playwright and long time friend Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) who to wrote him a script. When he only receives 14 pages Denham cunningly manages to keep Driscoll on the boat as it leaves.From there, several other characters aside from ill-judging Captain Eagelhorn (Thomas Kretschmann), such as likable character Mr. Hayes (Evan Parke), Mr. Hayes' charge and admirer Jimmy (Jamie Bell), Choy (Lobo Chan) and multitalented Andy Serkis as Lumpy the Cook and KING KONG himself are introduced. All of the actors show of their talent by bringing their characters to life. Even if it for brief moments on screen, its believable.The storyline revolving around Naomi's character Ann Darrow and King Kong was well thought out (another plus for me is that Kong didn't undress Ann Darrow like he did in the 1970s remake). The natives of the Skull Island were actually given some respect and an overall intelligent revamp from their 1933 counterparts. They were frightening natives with the means to capture Ann Darrow and serve her up to Kong, instead of impassively stupid natives dressed in hula dresses. Though they still retained their ""black as the hinges of hell"" complexion. Another plus is only one of them is killed. The character development was nicely placed in the movie, each of the characters that survive are completely different from they were at the beginning of the movie. The length of the movie is understandable if anything; King Kong would've been rather disappointing if it had been narrowed down to two hours and they tried to cram all of the stuff that had in the movie over that running time. The film pulls you into moments of clam or relaxation and comes out of nowhere with moments that make you jump. The Score done by James Newton Howard (""ER"" theme guy) give scenes in the movie well deserved atmosphere but you'll be hard pressed to notice there's music in the background for you'll be too engrossed in the action taking place on the screen to notice.The movie's CGI is also a splendor to behold in and of itself. The animation is excellently blended into the film. King Kong himself is realistically animated by Serkis who is widely known by LOTR fans for bringing the fallen character Gollum/Semeagol to life in the all three award winning movies. He moved and behaved exactly like a Silver back Gorilla would. Just little details in Kong's behavior made you believe he was a real creature and not a CGI character. The use animal-inspired prehistoric creatures on Skull Island, designed after Dougal Dixon's work were realistically brought to life on screen with the scary realism of what you'd think dinosaurs and insects would act like on an island untouched my mankind's machines and industry. The Spider-Pit scene wasn't as creepy as I initially thought it would be but it was convincing nonetheless with the giant leeches and other insects.All in all KING KONG gets the props he deserves in Peter Jackson's remake Its a highly enjoyable movie worth owning on DVD when its released. ---- [a 4 out of 5]"	4.0	I like this King Kong . . . . !!	2005-12-23	0	0	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A13PTDC1W7TZDR	"Philip D. Boettge ""Cardhu"""	(Widescreen DVD format.)  This version of King Kong starts out very well with believable characters, subplots, and scripting.  The story sets up several hints at interesting characters with intriguing personal stories.  The one indication that the script may turn into Hollywood nonsense is Mr. Driscoll being stuck in an animal cage.Everything else seems to be going great until the big tree trunk over the ravine.  At that point, the script drops everything on the floor - characterizations, relationships, and depth - to focus on ridiculous scenes of grotesque deaths and stampeding bouncing dinosaurs (which are, in a way, hilarious in their absurdity).  Resolutions of all the interesting stories set up in the beginning become moot as characters are knocked off left and right.The sole relationship of any depth is the strange Stockholm Syndrome pseudo-romance between Ann Darrow and King Kong.  Ann Darrow's on-again, off-again fascination with Kong is especially incoherent at the end of the movie.  Finally, with Kong splat on the concrete, all other relationships and many loose ends are left completely dangling.We agree with another reviewer - this is another case of focus on superficial appearance with CGI effects at the expense of completely abandoning all story depth.	2.0	A Great Start That Drops Everything On The Floor	2009-09-12	2	1	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1121RHJDUOBOR	Phillip G.	"I Will keep this review short and sweet. First off I never got the chance to see this movie in theaters, but I have stumbled upon a advanced DVD screening copy (not ripped but the real deal) at a flea market (yes its real duh and has those annoying marquee messages that pop up saying this is for award critics only), basically the movie is good and Jack Black add his own comedic sense of style in this movie as a con man attitude whos down and out and needs to make this last movie on skull island or hes pretty much dead in the water in the film industry if he doesnt pull it off. When they get there they find out more then they bargained for and Jack Blacks character relentlessly tries to see his movie through and through even if it comes to death. But there are times... quite a bit of times where the movie gets drawn out as in it juss takes a lil bit too long to get to the point and the drawled out scenes doesn't really keep it interesting. I'm not in no way comparing this movie to Lord Of The Rings, it does have the same kinda feel to the lord of the rings as in that it takes a lot of time telling the story and i mean a lot. Basically its a good film but it didn't really do too much for me. Great visuals and special effects, good acting, and the scenes with the natives are especially great and well thought out. If it wasn't so ""drawled"" out so to speak I'd give it 5 but i have never seen the original movie so i can't contest to say if it was the same way. so maybe other people will greatly appreciate it. So no one takes me wrong by the way Im a lord of the rings fan and do like the long story telling but it was in no way boring or drawled like some of the scenes in king kong (which are few but long).+ Good story+ Jack Black plays his character well and adds some comedic value  to the movie which keeps you drawed in+Great visual effects and Kudos to the scenes with the native savages and the sacrafice scene- Only thing that keeps me from giving this movie a 5 star rating is there are some scenes that are boring (to me so i dont get flamed by other reviewers) and will kinda withdrawl the audience.All and all by the movie its worth it"	4.0	Good Movie But not Peter Jacksons Best	2006-03-19	7	2	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ALWB64XOXNMDP	Picardfan007	I do have a special place in my heart for the movie King Kong.  It's the first movie I purchased on VHS wayyy back in 1987.  It was the first year I purchased a VCR to tape Star Trek: the Next Generation.I have to tell you on every level that Peter Jackson made Kong real to me. The original was timeless, however this one is an update and makes the characters more realistic than ever.I don't know how the CGI department made him look real and almost human! Without giving away the whole movie; when you looked in Kongs eyes, it looked like there was a person behind them.  There was a brain behind that look in his eyes when he was staring at his female costar.  I don't know how it was achieved so well with a computer but I have to say to see this movie once is not enough.  It will become another one of those classics that you can come back to again.	5.0	Surpasses the original in every way	2006-04-06	3	2	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	"A great movie can be determined by the hours passed without feeling the urge to go to the toilet even if a movie takes three hours long.  Peter Jackson has made his name in making great fantasy movie and ""King Kong"" did just that for me, making me escape from the real world for that three hours.  Audience cringed, laughed, awed, sobbed along the way.  This movie was handled with a great sensitivity.  Where the ""Godzilla"" remake failed miserably few years back, ""King Kong"" opted for a more intimate story line where the three hours were used wisely to build the depth of characters and also to give audience an educated background information regarding blossoming relationship of the giant ape and Ann Darrow.  ""King Kong"" seemed to be divided into four half sessions:  first quarter was rather slow moving, showing us the difficulty of making a dime during the Depression era and what made Ann decided to take the journey to the Far East to make a living and explaining to the audience how the movie director, Denham and the writer, Jack Driscoll met up with Ann at the first place.  By now, audience that had watched Peter Jackson's movies before such as ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""Frighteners"" would be familiar with his close-up portrait shots of people and moving scenes.  Then, second quarter concentrated on the ship, introducing us to the ship crew (some of them would be killed off one by one later), and building up of the tension between the passengers and the crew as they discovered of Denham's ulterior motive of heading to Skull Island.  Some audience giggled due to some similarity to ""Titanic""'s deck scene between Kate Winslet and Leonardo.  Third quarter went up a notch with the meeting of the ""friendly"" locales of the Skull Island, the misadventures with the creatures in the jungle (many highlights here with those dizzying camera swivels focusing on the dinasours stampede, the fight between Kong and many creatures to save Ann Darrow, crew struggling to keep themselves alive from many giant insects) and the tender moment when Kong's eyes betrayed his feelings for Ann Darrow and when she reciprocated back her feeling, and last quarter, the final show down on top of Empire States Building between Kong and the bi-planes and the last time, we bid farewell to the misunderstood creature.  Suffice to say that the graphics were truly outstanding and what's even more outstanding is that it's made in Wellington, New Zealand.  The set was sumptuous, made in Art Deco style, the in-thing in the 1930's.  Naomi Watts, Jack Black, Andy Serkis, Adrien Brody were truly true to form and they truly engaged the audience.  It's not difficult to feel a lump in our throat upon leaving the cinema thinking of ""Kong"" and his love for the girl that he loved.  ""Gorillas in the Mist"" starring Sigourney Weaver was another movie that you should watch if you want to find out more about the silverbacks.  There were many instances where Peter Jackson divulged to us the Kong's dead family members in his lair, his diet comprising of vegetables.  We simply need to be mindful upon watching the movie.  For those that are curious about the insects, please search for a book item produced by WETA that are available for sale, giving us a background information of all of them and other creatures that lived in Skull Island.  Talking about ""God is in details"", the Peter Jackson let their imagination takes flight in imagining the ecosystem that creates and sustains the habitat in that island.  A very personal movie for Peter Jackson and a movie that MUST be viewed on the big screen.  Highly recommended"	4.0	Truly outstanding	2005-12-21	5	1	4

Okay, so someone REALLY wouldn't be that good with a machine gun to shoot bugs off of someone, even if they were gigantic, but. . .At first I didn't think Jack Black (Carl Denham) was going to make the grade in this movie, but as I continued to watch his character evolve into someone not ready to fall on the floor and wiggle like a giant beetle (School of Rock), I think he came out with flying colors. I was hoping Naomi Watts' character would punch him in the face at the end, but . . . Hey, you can't have everything.The sensationalism/special effects, call them what you will were there and right on cue throughout the entire movie. They were part of the story and rock solid, unlike many of the others, which were there only to sell tickets and leave you scratching your head when it was over. Ala The Mummy! Give me a break! How powerful can a zombie wrapped in gauze be?The movie is quite long 3hrs 8min, but I found it was worth every moment of it and not just a waste of valuable life and time.

The action-scenes are fantastic, the atmosphere of the movie capturing (it really is so exiting!), it grabbed my attention from the start -and held a tight grip until it was finnished, and I didn't want it to end actually. The only negative thing is that, well, ""King Kong"" has a tearwet ending. Indeed.

I never really thought the first movie was that interesting except as an interesting special effects flick, which though showing effects way ahead of its time, still didn't really have a story I cared much about.  Seeing the commercials for this and how the dinosaurs all looked like animated bits of gravy lumps, knowing that it was over three hours long on a story I didn't care about, and so on, I figured it really wasn't worth the time.Actually, I found its excessiveness and absurdities to be its best parts.  Absolutely nothing in this movie really stands under the weight of, ""Why?"", but it is drastically refreshing to see a director just let go and do whatever he wants, as much as he wants, as long as he wants.  This movie ended up being well worth the time... even when the scenes seemed like they'd never end.The problem is, I could nitpick it forever.  Nobody likes a nitpicker, so I won't, and since it's absurd anyway, nitpicking it won't serve any purpose but to aggravate the playlength.  Instead, I spent my time enjoying what I could, among them1) Now Kong and Ann actually have a relationship that makes the closing line have any meaning.2) Kong's animated expressiveness matches that of Gollum's, but Kong has the added difficulty of being unable to speak.3) Jack Black is funny.  Okay, so he wasn't meant to be, but still he came off as funny.  I enjoyed it at least.4) Adrien Brody is a great actor and I was amazed at how much emotion he put into a role that I'm pretty sure nobody even remotely connected to this movie cared that much about.The things that couldn't be ignored was stuff like that side story involving the child hand on the ship (soooooo useless...) and the orcs... 'scuse me, natives... attacking in very long and boring slow motion.Overall I'm glad I actually ended up seeing it.  I can't really see myself seeing it much more often, but for one viewing it entertains for a good long time, keeping up the pace the entire time.A note on this DVD edition: I don't know if it's the transfer or not, but the sound on this thing is TERRIBLE.  Whenever the sound effects sound like they're supposed to get loud, everything deadens.  I've tried it on two different speaker systems and eventually with headphones and finally settled with the headphones because I could still hear what was going on on those scenes.--PolarisDiB"	3.0	Let go	2006-06-21	4	2	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1GBINHNAQWVC9	"Prabal ""All paths lead to God..."""	Jackson has got it wrong this time but not everything. The first one-hour of the film - the audience might as well have a nice sleep. The choice of Naomi Watts is absolutely wrong cause she doesn't look fresh but jaded, aged and over the hill for this role. I think Nicole Kidman would have been the right choice with her moues and limited acting skills. The visual attractions of the movie like dinosaurs' fights and King Kong antics leave you cold. The background music fails the movie horrendously. In trying to keep the originality of the score the composer has lost sight of the movie's subject and fails most supremely to create a menacing atmosphere.However, one would have not expected this but Jack Black leaves his usual circus-dog antics and acts well. Brody might as well not been there. Rest of cast nap through the movie! However, one ought to see this movie because it has been feted and celebrated in this present time we're living in and we must not leave anything that life offers us, isn't it?

They have pushed the limits of computer aided special effects accomplishing feats that were not previously possible.  Putting the irregularity of real life back into special effects is not easy.  The result is a genuinely believeable presentation.  The aminated Kong was believeable as a real ape.  On the big screen I-at times-felt like I was IN the scene.  Just amazing!  The giant theme is well complemented with a colorful mix of characters.  The movie flows very well.  It was a long movie, but you won't notice.  The credits will flash and you won't believe that it's over already.  Nothing done before comes close to this movie, so you really have to see it for yourself.  It leaves a very distinct impression.  If you liked the original King Kong, you will like this movie.  If you are into special effects, action, adventure, monster, or epic movies, you will love this movie.  If you liked Lord of the Rings, you will WORSHIP this movie.	5.0	King of All Movies!!!	2006-03-14	10	9	1

I have been a fan of Naomi Watts since ""The Ring"".  Here she is wonderful as the the beauty who tames the savage beast.The special effects are of the highest caliber though I admit I grew a little weary of the fight scenes betwee the computer generated animals/monsters.  Thankfully, the movie did not descend into a special effects extravaganza, usually to hide the fact that the writing was less than stellar. Though not a big fan of Jack Black, he was most competent as the director whose priorities left much to be desired.It is certainly a worthy addition to anyone's collection."	4.0	Very Good Remake	2006-04-05	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3VHUQ85RH0BC3	"Raj ""rajivsreviews"""	"Being one of the most anticipated movies of the year, I decided to go see `King Kong' to see what all the hype was about. Even though this movie is more than three hours long, I found it to be one of the best movies to be released this year.The story takes place in 1933, where Ann Darrow (played by Naomi Watts), a theatre actress, loses her job and is trying her best to make ends meets. Meanwhile Carl Denham (played by Jack Black), a movie director, runs away with the film equipment from the company after they reject his script. Having no actress to play the lead role, he sees Ann and asks her to act in his movie. He also traps Jack Driscoll (played by Adrien Brody), the writer for his film, into coming along with them for the filming. Ann and Jack fall in love along the way. Carl has other plans for his movie, which includes filming in an undiscovered island, not knowing what lies in it. When they go there, they experience things that would change their lives forever.Since I haven't watched any previous versions of King Kong (even though I knew vaguely about the story), I really cannot compare how good or bad it is from the others, but I can say that I loved watching this film! It has everything in it: love, action, adventure, drama etc. which is what one expects from such a movie. The first one hour of a movie is a little slow, because it only shows the character developments; but after they reach Skull Island, the movie becomes a wonderful rollercoaster ride with a lot of twists and turns, amazing special effects, action, drama, everything put into one. Even though this movie is really long, I didn't find it dragging, but I admit that some of the scenes could have been easily omitted.Naomi Watts once again shows us that she is a talented actress by playing her role as Ann Darrow. Some reviews mention that all she did was scream a lot in the movie, but I feel her performance was the best because it is really hard to act with an imaginary character, especially one such as King Kong. Jack Black, Colin Hanks, Thomas Kretschmann, Andy Serkis, Kyle Chandler and the rest of the cast also acted wonderfully! Even though I like Adrien Brody's acting, I feel his character was a complete waste in this film, as he never really did anything that had a major impact in the storyline. I feel that is one of the few things that Peter Jackson could have revised. But other than that, I loved everything about King Kong. The special effects were fantastic in most scenes, but could have been made more realistic in some parts, such as the shipwreck before Skull Island.On the whole, I found ""King Kong"" much better than Peter Jackson's previous works, including Lord of the Rings."	5.0	Better than I thought it would be!	2005-12-26	15	11	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A192N4CVUU4K3L	Randy S. Roth	"Maybe it would be best going in to see this movie without trying to compare it to either the 1933 or 1976 versions.  Go in with the idea that it will be entertaining, and you won't be all that disappointed.As with most of the movies made today, special effects seem to trump mediocre acting, miscasting, and weak story lines.  This holds true for the most part in this vision of King Kong, although in contrast to the main stars, the supporting cast (the ship's captain, first mate and other character-type actors) were very good and ""right on the money.""This film takes the tack of making a great tale of terror into an inter-species love story.  This is the major tack that punctured 1976's King Kong, deflating it into an utter loser (although King Kong 1976's acting and special effects contributed somewhat to its failure, as well).King Kong 2005 also holds possibly the two defining moments of movie idiocy, and both should have been left on the cutting room floor.  The first was the Ann Darrow character doing vaudeville routines and juggling for Kong.  It gave me the impression she was KONG's pet monkey throughout the rest of the film.  The second moment of asinine antics was a kid shooting prehistoric bugs off the body of another character - with a Thompson submachine gun, yet!  The guy with the bugs was left unscathed.  And you thought TV's Sgt Saunders from ""Combat"" was good with HIS tommy gun, eh?  These two prize scenes should have been relegated to the ""deleted scenes"" feature of some DVD so it wouldn't be necessary to cringe during the movie.The original King Kong (1933) was truly a story of terror and the only love aspect was between Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll.  King Kong was a ""force of nature"" that was possession-obsessed with Ann (imagine a mean, 25-foot tall stalker) and Ann was TERRIFIED of him all the way through to the Empire State Building!  The 1933 King Kong was the type of movie that, afterward, gave you the willies every time you looked out a window at night - expecting to see a big hairy face with blazing eyes glaring back at you.  Both the 1976 and 2005 King Kong flicks failed in this aspect.Although this was definitely a ""labor of love"" by Mr. Peter Jackson, and it does succeed on some levels, I really hope the next re-make of King Kong gets us ""back to the basics.""  If you have the Jurassic Park series, you may want to include King Kong 2005 with them.  You can still keep the original 1933 King Kong on its own pedestal."	3.0	King Kong a LOVE Story???	2006-04-02	4	2	2

Just finished watching it, it took me a couple of evenings to get through it, I have a job hehe. Without question, all the special effects are up with Peter Jackson's other films. I just wish a lot more thought had gone into the original story, and also wouldn't it be nice to see some genuinely great characters and true epics from mr Jackson. All of his films are full of childish wannabes and fantasy heroes who just don't cut it for me.This story's well-known to most people, but does anyone else get annoyed by the complete lack of appreciation for nature? Seriously, to a giant gorilla, a blonde bombshell will be not much more than a stinky little cockroach. And I emphasize stinky. You know the way most other animals smell unpleasant to humans. (Unless roasted hehe.)I mean it's one thing to get an extraterrestrial pet for Christmas, you may get emotionally attached to it, but I struggle to believe you would fall in love with its ""beauty"", which would have zero effect on you, because that's how nature works. And otherwise male gorillas in the wild are not exactly renowned for motherly instincts, are they?And another thing, this poor King Kong fellow must have been desperately bored to even pay attention to a hairless little creature. I mean what the hell happened to all the other gorillas? Hello??? It's called a species?

Naomi's acting is OK, and she can be pretty when the lighting is just right. But as an actress, she should be limited to small parts doing pub scenes. The way she wins the monkey's heart is absolutely absurd. Don't get this movie to see attractive people; there aren't any in it. There are maybe two or three extras that are passable, but that's it. The movie is way, way too long (about 3 hours), and uses the cinematic style used in ""Lord of Ring."" It doesn't work here. There are lots of slow-mo shots, but not one of them works. They could've shortened the movie by a half-hour by taking the slow-mo shots out. The movie is in sepia, which appropriately rhymes with insipid, which can be applied to about 90% of this movie. The computer-animated creatures are computer-game quality. At least the ones I saw were bad. I kept fast forwarding the DVD to bypass the bad stuff, which was a waste of time because the whole movie is bad.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A29R3O02O0PON4	"Razr Maxx ""Metal Head"""	"OK, first of all, you may wonder why only 4 stars.  Well, let me explain.This film is first and fore-most a visual feast for the eyes.  The level of detail in all of the films locations and set pieces is truely draw-dropping.  From the creatures to the ship to Skull Island and even New York itself, the level of computer image technology, model and miniature work today is truely outstanding.  (Watch the Production Diaries to see what I mean.)Anyway, so why the 4 stars?  Well if you wanna watch Peter Jackson's King Kong for a well thought out acted drama, go elsewhere.  Wait...why would I say that?  Well, once the action gets to the island and the ship's crew is chasing down Kong and Anna, there's very little dialogue.  Just a bunch of screaming and shooting and dying.  Which is good thing and fitting for the scenes, but there's very little verbal reasoning for advancing the story in the normal way if you know what I mean.  Basically what I'm saying is that the action on screen advances the story on its own, I guess.  We're talking ""the thrill of the chase"" so-to-speak.Anyway, if you like to watch modern movies for eye candy, well look no further.  This film has got to be the most lavish film I have ever seen.  The environments are so detailed that they really look alive.  No other Kong movie has even come close to this level of realism in that department.  The multitude of creatures that WETA created for this film is truely phenomenal.  I was sitting there, watching the DVD, saying ""They must've spent of bundle for all these effects shots.""  I was even impressed with the CG New York skyline for the final Empire State Building scene.  Trying to create a authentic 1933 New York skyline and cityscape in the computer would not be easy either.  The Biplane attack sequence at the end was very spectacular.  I've never seen anything as unique as that.  Very creative camera shots.Oh yeah, the sound is good too.  The current DVD only comes with a DD 5.1 track, but it's still very good with deep solid bass for Kong's growl and other creature effects.  Hopefully the rumored extended edition will come with a DTS track...and some commentaries!But back to the 4 star thing.  I'd give it 5, but the lack of conventional story telling and having the story action driven is usually not a good method of making a film.  However, in this case, the method works, but I was looking for a little more character development for some of the minor characters, and even some additional development to explain some of the main characters' motivations.Anyway...still a solid movie and one to be a masterpiece for sure.  Even though the Oscars pretty much snubbed it, I'd say Kong (2005) will have a cult following for years to come.  Basically this ain't gonna be Godzilla (1998) if you know what I mean."	4.0	A Visual and Audio Feast	2006-03-29	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ABSSM9979QKWH	"R. Cruz ""Online Aging Punk :)"""	I had to review this after seeing all the great reviews here. First off this movie didnt make back what it cost to make in its initial run, and was panned by most respected critics. By any reasonable computation the movie was a box office flop. Word of mouth basically killed the film after its opening weekend and here are a couple of the reasons. This film was the biggest dissapointment that I personally have ever received at the movie theater. The scenes where it looks like the ape is in love and especially the laughing and mock ice skating scenes were totally unnecessary and patently ridiculous. The special effects while impressive at times were so obviously CGI in certain scenes on the big screen that I thought I was watching a film from 15 years ago. I mean the dinosaurs in the first Jurassic park were way more believable. I my wife and 2 kids boys of 4 and 12 at the time respectively all thought the movie blew. The only time that I have been anywhere near this dissapointed in a movie that I had thought would be good was X-MEN 2. I will now say after an agonizingly thorough dressing down, that it appears I was completely wrong to assert that this film was not a commercial success. However I will restate that this film was a huge personal dissapointment, and that my whole family hated it.	1.0	Wow,  3 hrs and 7 minutes I'll never get back!	2007-03-23	14	4	10

It's a terrifically well done action movie to begin with and has great acting and writing with excellent plot and character development. In the theatre it tends to drag and seems too long, however, at home it's perfect--even the extended version which runs 200 minutes, because you can view it in several sittings if desired, so it always remains fresh throughout. The special effects, which are quite possibly the best ever, come across beautifully on the Blu-Ray version, and the final scenes on top of the Empire State Building, with planes buzzing Kong, come completely to life with gorgeous, magnificently convincing imagery of the 70-year old NYC skyline near sunrise, with incredibly realistic surround sound effects and soundtrack.

Garrard ""the G-man"""	"I, too, was caught up in the hype: I had to see Peter Jackson's ""King Kong""!Well, now that I've seen it, my opinion of the film can be summed up in one word: ""Why?""It is truly a fitting homage to the 1933 classic, complete with situations and dialogue lifted straight from the first film. Even a brief musical tribute is paid to original composer Max Steiner's groundbreaking score, heard during the ""opening night"" appearance of the captured Kong. Obviously, Peter Jackson admires the black and white picture immensely.This may explain his reason for remaking the film but it can't salvage it from scrutiny. There are many points of contention that I have with this movie.Naomi Watts, even while wearing stilettos, gives the best performance. Considering that many of her scenes were played against a ""green screen"" with an invisible co-star, she acquaints herself fine in demonstrating a variety of emotions. I think Adrian Brody was just hired to provide some additional Oscar-winning clout to the picture for his part was nothing spectacular to begin with and he did his best with it.As for Jack Black, I didn't think much of him before the picture and the movie didn't alter my perception.The movie is just too long, much like Jackson's LOTR trilogy, filled with extended battle scenes, sweeping landscape images, and implausible escapes.SPOILERS:C'mon! The stampeding brontosaurs should've taken out the entire search party.Watts is buffeted around during an elongated fight scene and doesn't get a scratch or a dirt mark of any kind???Black and Brody, along with another actor, are able to single-handedly hold off hundreds of insect beasties, while others in the cast easily become fodder for the monsters???During Kong's rampage through New York, people are just standing idly by, not trying to get out of the way of a 25-foot ape???I think not!One of the film's best sequences involves the initial discovery of Skull Island, a tense-filled one wherein Jack Black's ship is almost torn apart by rocks jutting out of the island seaside. This is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.It's too bad that the majority of the film does not come up to the bar. The other action sequences were no more thrilling than a Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote cartoon.As I left the theater, I couldn't help but think of Gus Van Zant's shot-by-shot remake of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" some years back.The same feeling of deja vu hit me and I'm still pondering, ""What was the point of Peter Jackson's remake?""If you're just going to build a BIGGER mousetrap but not a BETTER one..."	3.0	Did anyone ever consider redoing the Mona Lisa???	2005-12-28	9	4	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3TCOCO9PL7NZH	"REUBEN THAKER ""Reuben Thaker MD"""	Everyone knows this story so I will be brief.  1979 version w/ Jessica Lange had a stronger sexual element to the monkey/girl relation, but was very touching nonetheless.  The relation here is more of an 'obsession' with a prized possession to protect, that the gorilla has with the girl, versus some type of purely sexual interest.I hate to say it, but here goes, fellows, we have all been that ape at one time or another.  You know what Im saying.  So the story is universal in that we can identify with the feelings of the protagonist, even if it is a monkey.Certain scenes are visually unforgettable.  Such as when Kong escapes the theatre and finally sees the Girl again in NYC, walking smokily down a blue lit street in pitch black winter.  You can see his expression go from fear it wont be her, to calm, and sad acceptance.  Throughout, Kong looks doomed and aware of it, even on the island.  He seems to be an older creature, and tired of the throne, which makes the protector relation to the girl more convincing.Really, a true classic.  Snubbed at the Oscars, but then LOTR was grossly overpraised, so it evens out.  Do not miss this.	5.0	best telling of this story yet	2006-05-24	4	1	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1XESQ7C7NNZX4	Reviewer	A thing to add to the list of complaints about King Kong 2005 is the rather obvious plumpness of the actors.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2TBWLOHTZNK54	Reviewer	It's strange, but looking at the reviews this movie seems to be a love/hate movie. I can't imagine what makes it so polarizing. I found it cringe-worthy.My biggest gripes: nearly every action scene is cartoonish. A stampeding horde of brontosauruses not only can't outrun humans... it runs with them, over top them, without stepping on anyone. For several minutes. The same problem happens with the rest of the crazy dinosaur/island creatures... they don't seem to adhere to any principle of physics and motion, but gnash and crash and fall down all over the place while magically avoiding the main characters.Another problem is the love story. Why would a woman care about a freaking monkey? One that has eaten human sacrifices for decades, and that destroys everything whenever he feels like cutting lose. She doesn't recognize that part of him, just that he's a big sweet monkey who has love in his heart too. Aw[...] Not only that she doesn't just seem to like him as a friend. She seems to want to marry him. A 30 foot tall, man eating monkey. Of course, that's the original story, but they failed to help explain it any better.One more gripe: Jack Black. Great guy, very funny. He screws up this movie because it's not a comedy. Sorry Jack but you don't belong in a dramatic action movie where everyone's waiting for you to crack jokes. He doesn't crack any, by the way, but there's the problem. He's not one of those guys who acts well outside his comedy, and as an important personality in this film it's almost embarrassing to watch him have no dramatic presence.The one good thing is the visuals (for the most part, sometimes the CG feels disconnected from the actors), there's a lot of beauty shoved into some scenes.	2.0	King Kong sized absurdity	2007-08-26	7	3	4

After the LOTR trilogy, that is an indisputable fact. So why he'd want to turn this GODAWFUL movie script into an almost-three-hour ""Epic"" is something I'll never understand. Perhaps he wanted to remake the original, as he felt it ought to be seen. Fair enough. Perhaps he saw the scope of the premise and thought it would make a stunning film. That's understandable, too.But the whole point of the King Kong story is that it's a simple retelling of the Beauty and the Beast fairytale. Or The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Or The King and I. Or Mask. Or the Phantom of the Opera. Or... well, you get my point.What all those stories have in common are Characters. Characters, people that drive a story forward by the strength of their personalities in the face of physical adversity. So why, tell me, does the script for 'King Kong' completely and utterly disregard all but the most perfunctory characterisation, and instead regale us with lots of stupid, stupid dialogue (there's no nice way of saying that) and *really* lousy performances from the human actors involved??No, from a storytelling point of view, this is not a good movie. Naomi Watts is very pretty, but it appears to be a skin-deep talent: any old actress can scream and look lovelorn. Adrian Brody is hopelessly underutilised as the Good Guy, and lacks entirely the physical presence needed to pull off the mode of Hero. And Jack Black??! What the hell were the casting people thinking?? Jack Black, delivering the line ""Beauty killed the Beast. "", the last bit of dialogue in the film, with all the conviction and skill of a rhinoceros attempting ballet. None of it works, none at all.Extras are pretty blah, too: it's not possible to form any sort of bond with the crew of the transport ship because there's no time devoted to developing them as characters in the film: we couldn't care less about Jamie Bell, Thoman Kretschmann or Colin Hanks' characters because we never get to see or hear them do anything that sets them apart from the rest of the crew. And the grossly racist pseudo-African tribal dance of the extremely savage Savages isn't powerful or effective: rather than looking like devotees of a strange Ape-cult, as they are supposed to, they look instead like rejects from a bad David Cronenberg film.Which leads me to the real star of the show: Kong himself. Motion actor Andy Serkis must be given credit where it's due: the Ape, for the most part, moves in a convincing manner. And the computer-generated image of him works, too - this is a character with more personality than all the human 'cast' put together. It is a dreadful shame then, that Jackson decided to camp it up: the wholly unnessecary scenes of visual fluffing (the over-long Jurassic Park Throwback fight with the dinosaurs, the schmalzy and cheap ice-skating scene) show the one major flaw in Jackson's directorial style: egotism. A man who is seen to be able to do no wrong is a danger to his profession, and, very unfortunately, 'King Kong' suffers the very worst excesses of a director in love with his own image:We have an hour before the Ape appears, during which the one-dimensional characters are not developed, and a dull-as-all-hell storm scene rages on for ten minutes more than it needed to.A lot, a surprisingly awful lot, of the CGI scenes look cheap and basic: most of the time Naomi Watts is in Kong's hand, she either looks like a rag doll, or like she's outlined in blue. The sailors running from the dinosaurs looks ridiculous: the shadows don't match the background. And the fight between Kong and the T-Rex suffers from that fatal flaw of all CGI/Live-Action blend movies: the animated characters move just a little too slowly to be believable.The acting stinks. I know, I complained about this before, but it's just so necessary to complain about it again. Jackson was clearly far, far more concerned with coaxing better performances out of his cameramen and special effects team than he was with his human players - and in a movie where the whole point of the story is that it's driven by the ignorance and evolution of man's attitudes towards physical appearances, that's a fatal flaw.This dual DVD set is, if you're into this sort of thing, the best option: the picture and sound quality are great and the extras are nice to own - but for the most of us, rental is more than enough to experience the titanic failure of 'King Kong'. It is superficial, it is flashy, it is too long, and it's most certainly hollow.A big disappointment."	2.0	Mediocrity and the Beast	2006-04-20	10	5	5
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2WL02ENWFU9PM	Rex Macaroe	"Yesterday in casual conversation, I called The Manchurian Candidate the best remake I've seen of late. Last night, to my delighted amazement, I watched what will likely go down as one of the greatest remakes of all time.When you've topped the charts with the most profitable movie trilogy of all time, when you've created a film that wins 11 Oscars, when you've created the single greatest achievement in digital effects to date in one of the most epic fantasy series' in film history: what's your follow up act?I'd probably make an artsy talking heads film, but director Peter Jackson has dared to raise the bar by remaking one of the most beloved films in history. Anyone who's seen the 1970s remake knows that he's treading dangerous waters, and with all the remakes, revisits, and game adaptations polluting the screens this year, even the largest budget in film history is hardly enough to make this a confident exploit.But Jackson has the two ingredients needed to make this work: he understands why the original works, and he understands why it doesn't. King Kong of the 1930s, for all its amazement, was pretty disturbing in the way it explored its themes. Kong was an extremely sympathetic creature, but Faye Wray's Ann was shallow and self-absorbed. Here Naomi Watts provides an intelligent character who grows to understand Kong's compassion and beauty.Which brings us to the $ 64,000 question: Does it surpass the original?I had the good fortune of catching the 1930s version on TCM yesterday, so I get to compare them with both films fresh in my mind. In my taste, the original is superior.I say ""in my taste"" because it really just comes down to a matter of taste. Both films work equally well on their respective levels. It's all a quetion of what you fancy. I'm a sucker for long takes of a charging stegosaurus, and I liked how Kong was unappreciated in the original. Jackson's version works on many more levels, but the original works better on its own terms.The one place where Jackson stepped wrong was with the natives. It was as if they waited around for a lost ship of white people to come around so they could murder its members and go into convulsions. They don't really do much else. Their presence is a nuisance but short lived, leaving time to get to the real story.This goes beyond what I thought a good remake was capable of. It somehow remains almost entirely true to the original, while still feeling fresh and new. I hope this one gets more tha technica nominations at Oscar-time because I haven't seen a film like this since....well, King Kong."	5.0	Hail to the King!	2005-12-17	2	0	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ANUBY6KOT60WH	R. Galeano Valencia	The classic gigantic-ape-in-mistery-island story comes again to life under the magnificent direction of Peter Jackson, who utterly proves himself as one of the most important filmmakers in history, by delivering a visually stunning as well as dramatically engaging movie.Despite the perils of a very worn-out story line, the movie ends up as a masterpiece of modern cinematics and it is undoubtedly due to a solid and well-written script framed within a clear director's vision and accompanied by a great cast of actors.Skillfully, Jackson manages to avoid the temptation of just filling up the screen with flamboyant mega digital effects and ultimately finds the adequate balance between state of the art computer graphics (which are simply amazing here) and the need of giving a sense of reality onscreen (even within the fantasy of the plot). As a result, King Kong won't leave audiences with the feeling of having watched a 3-hour long video game in the movie theater. Instead you'll enjoy three hours or so of truly great cinema.	5.0	Shocked by the monkey...	2006-09-28	12	9	3

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2JHHGV6AQG0DD	"R. Hayek ""Penn State Super Fan"""	"I expected a lot out of this movie and I was not disappointed.Plot: 5 Stars.  While there are no great surprises in the plot, the beauty of this movie is how the plot unfolds and develops, how the story continues to build and how in the very end, the emotion, special effects and acting combine for a seamless climax. You are not left wondering how you got to certain points in the movie.Audience Reaction:  5 Stars.  The movie is a fine tuned roller coaster ride.  The audience was truely dazzled.  I never heard so many ""Geeeez"" in all my life.  There is humor but it's not over done.  The cooks theory about the abominable snow man is a hoot.  There is stress and tension but not anything that will short circuit your pace maker.  Best of all I felt the movie connected with the audience.  While I did not cry I found my 14 year old daughter bawling her eyes out.  She has never cried at a movie before.  The poor lady behind me was sobbing like her pet cat Squeeker just fell out of a tree and got run over by a super hero.  I noticed a lot of hankeys on the way out of the theater.Special Effects:  5 Stars.  Anymore, I expect special effects to be seamless and not a distraction due to their poor quality.  King Kong's special effects are, as of today, the best I have ever seen.  There is only one part in the movie where I was a little uncomfortable with an effect.  Kong tosses around Ann Darrow to the point where her neck should have been snapped.  I can live with that.  The T-Rex's, Kongs fight scenes, the bugs, the swamp slugs (awesome) and the Empire State building were so very real.  I did think the swamp slugs should have eaten an attorney rather than the cook.Scale:  5 Stars.  Too often special effects characters change their size during a movie.  One minute they are 100 feet tall in one scene and then 10 feet tall in another scene.  Kong and the other creatures in the movie stay the same size.  Kong is not sitting comfortably in the back of a pickup truck in one scene and then holding that very same pickup truck in his hand in the next scene.  This makes the movie so much more believable and realistic.Family Entertainment Value:  5 Stars.  This is a movie you can take the entire family to.  There are no unnecessary sex, nude or vulgar language scences.  The closest the movie gets to anything uncomfortable is when Ann Darrow stands in front of a burlesque theater and there are some visible mildly suggestive posters of women.Kong:  5 Stars.  The star of the movie.  A masterpiece of special effects and character research.  Kong actually acts like a gorilla in love with a beautiful blonde.  (Not that I have actully seen that happen before)  Kong's facial, hand and body expressions and movements are realistic and right out of the jungle.  Kong's character changes throughout the movie.  I don't think he is just dazzled by the beauty of Ann Darrow (so wonderfully played by Naomi Watts) but he is also captivated and confused by her courage in front of him.  Kong respects her because she begins to show no fear and you sense that change in him.In Summary:  5 Stars.  You can safely take your entire family to this movie and enjoy the ride.  The acting is impecible, the plot entertaining and the special effects are special.  Peter Jackson has truely gone beyond Lord of the Rings.  Thank you Peter and the rest of the gang."	5.0	Kong, The Final Chapter.  This One Cannot Be Re-made.	2005-12-30	9	5	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1SGBK90R4QJW7	R. Hilliard	"Remaking a classic can be a thankless undertaking, but Peter Jackson has crafted a film that stands shoulder to shoulder with the original. Although he rarely mentions other films in KONG history, Jackson has taken elements not only from the 1933 original, but also the DeLaurentiis remake, SON OF KONG, and even KING KONG ESCAPES to forge an epic film about a giant ape and the woman he loves. It's these later films that informs Jackson's take on the love story, as the human object of the gorilla's affections comes to love the monster as well. Of course this also brings the ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme full circle, and makes the film's ending even more tragic. Many uninformed critics have labelled this movie ""Jurrassic Kong,"" but clearly they are not familiar with the amout of dinosaurs that populate the original film. Now the expanded edition features even more prehistoric action sequences and they are a real treat, particularly the ""Log Raft"" sequence. This new edition is well worth the time and expense, and the Kong mini-statue is a cool bonus - GET IT NOW."	5.0	A breathtaking epic	2006-11-18	5	1	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AGJLO8GK3A1SX	R. Hussain	Another solidly packed midnight preview screening and the film clocks in at over 3 hours!Well, where to start, eh?I've avoided the trailers, reviews, posters, etc, so that my experience would not be tainted by advance publicity. Thus, I sat in the theatre like a newborn virgin expecting the first tinges of excitement.The script, although containing several new plot threads, follows the classic formula set down by the original film. The first hour is spent building up the characters, setting up the mystery and allowing some comedy elements to seep in.Jack Black, who I normally abhor, is acceptable in his role as the megalomaniac director pursuing a doomed project, Adrien Brody has enough charm in his eyes to carry off his role as secondary hero, Andy Serkis as the ship's cook and Kong is simply awesome, Noami Watts lacks the raw eroticism of Jessica Lange and the primordial energy of Fay Wray but she bestows her role with acres of bubbly charisma. The chemistry between her and Kong is palpable and time is given to showcase their tragic romance.The film has been lovingly created by Peter Jackson and his team of film magicians but there are several moments where the CGI effects look flakey and unvarnished. However, the pacing never wavers and any technical deficiency is easily overlooked by the sheer scale of the adventure which rampages across the screen. The artistic design of the film is beautifully realized and no expense has been spared in creating a mammoth world of danger and suspense. The natives of Skull Island are terrifying in a hallucinatory manner (someone should immediately give Jackson a CANNIBAL / ZOMBIE project next).Those amongst us who may deride the film for lacking any intelligent muscle, I simply say just take a moment and ponder upon the sly political subtext that Jackson has weaved into his film. The allusion to recent world events and the ensuing bloodshed is laid bare in the poignant climax. There is also much made of Joseph Conrad's THE HEART OF DARKNESS in the banter between the cabin boy, Jamie Bell, and the ship's Second Mate.The soundtrack, as with the recent NARNIA, never really soars and the main love theme lacks the melodic emotional resonance that should impale the hardest of hearts when Kong and his love spend a few tender moments as the sun sets on their world.Okay, the film may not be as groundbreaking in the way the original one was, but it still has tons of innovation and high octane adventure to capture the minds of most people.Recommended.	3.0	Hail to the new King!	2005-12-14	8	2	6
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2U0ABMZK6XBVF	"Richard A. Tucker ""Tucker at large"""	The missing bits were really missed by this lover of the old King Kong.I was so glad to see these scenes in the extended edition. For those who think this film is too long I won't try to sell you on those missing parts because I think only those of us who knew they were there, and what they were, could really appreciate them. Also, you had the option of buying the theatrical cut instead, so why anyone would complain about the additional scenes is a mystery to me.The story was even more poignant for me because of the added texture the extended scenes added to the profoundly violent and deadly nature of Skull island. This was a place that killed you or scarred you, and it explains very well the extreme lifestyle adopted by the islanders. Despite all the horror and tragedy we see Denham as an exploiter in this cut. He's not be sympathized and he deserves the fate he's handed for his arrogance and his greed. He's oddly a likable person but he's also clearly flawed, and perhaps beyond redemption. What I like about this new version of Kong is the fact that at it's heart it feels like the same movie that Willis O'Brien made all those years ago. Peter Jackson, however, considered his audience and decided not just to WOW! them but also to educate them on the world of movie adventure. His message rings lod and clear; adventure, even on film, is not glamorous and it is rarely fun. In this case, it is lethal. Ironically Kong comes through as the lone survivor of his kind on Skull Island and it's is that staid life in 'civilization' that is more savage than he can cope with. In the end not only beauty killed the beast, but, also, the greed and fear that is ever apparent in the world of human beings.	5.0	With Jackson, longer is better	2007-01-09	2	1	1

Great monkey, great island,etc, etc.  Loved the cast except for Jack Black (who I generally love).  I had a hard time accepting him in this role.  Bugs were great, tribe was great, boat was great.  See, the pieces of the puzzle were all really nice pieces but somehow they didn't fit together.  Since I thought the movie was already about 30 minutes too long, I can't believe they're putting out an extended version.  Why?  So we can see more of a love interest between beauty and the beast?  Too much of a chase scene through New York.I believe what worked in the LOTR trilogy didn't work as well here.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AXOS8IWBXNZGT	"Richard W Little ""I am a maple leaf on the wi..."	"Right now, I'd have to say that Peter Jackson is at the top of his game, and must feel like he's on top of the world. After winning Oscars for his labour of love, the Lord of the Rings, he got to turn his attention back to making his childhood fantasy, a remake of King Kong.And it shows, in all the little details.The music from the original King Kong was used in the scene on Broadway, when King is revealed to the audience. They actors playing the natives in that scene are wearing the same style costumes that were worn by the ""actual natives"" in the original. A lot of attention was paid to making New York look like it did in the original movie, whenever possible. Many of the scenes are lifted from the original movie. The last line definitely is.At the same time, Jackson is true to his roots. Some of the horrifying scenes and cinematography hearken back to his days making horror movies (such as the first encounter with all of the skulls on the island).I also liked the sly references that occurred from time to time. For instance, the director (played by Jack Black) has to go with Ann Darrow (played by Naomi Watts), because Fay Wray is unavailable, making a movie for RKO (which would have been the original King Kong, if you think about it).So, with all this attention to detail, how could I not love this movie? It's a great popcorn movie, with a great supporting cast (the cast is all supporting Kong, after all). The special effects are fluid and believable, and the music score works well. Andy Serkis deserves special note, for researching out how gorillas move about, and he's captured it well in his portrayal of Kong.It's definitely worth seeing. It may be a little too scary for small children. It's long, at roughly three hours, so go to the bathroom before the movie starts."	5.0	Kong is the new King	2006-01-02	4	3	1

Then i saw the 1933 version again back in the 70's at a revival on the big screen.  That was impressive. But this new version with it's special effects totally take away from the story line and is way over done.  I'll never understand what and why Hollywood has this obsession with special effects.  I much rather see a film for it's acting and who can beat the old way of special effects before computers.  You call computers creative?  Anyone can do this type of thing but in the older films it took TALENT to make a film like ""King Kong"" something that Hollywood doesn't believe in anymore.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1MIFU0YKLG40T	Rick Galati	"Like so many others, I am an ardent fan of the 1933 horror classic and I was deeply suspicious of the release of this effort given that awful campy remake produced by Dino de Laurentiis in 1976. I purposefully waited until this current interpretation became available on DVD because I didn't want to waste my time again. That was a mistake.  This was a very good movie that maintained the spirit and tone of the original ""King Kong"" while stylistically blending technical and comic elements reminiscent of 1999's ""The Mummy"" to great advantage. This is what the popcorn selling movie experience should be about! A bit too long at 3 hours, this film could have easily been condensed to 2:15 to 2:30 run time without losing any substance of value except perhaps 30-45 minutes of unneeded content. Still, I was entirely enchanted by Naomi Watts portrayal of Ann Darrow and she played the role with a deft sensitivity and she did it without slipping and falling on campy drivel like Jessica Lange did in the first remake. The special effects were as they say...""spot on."" Kudo's all around for a stunning simulation of 1930's New York City. Skull Island was captured as both a horrifically menacing, yet breathtakingly beautiful place. A highly believable, expressive and profoundly tragic life was magically if more accurately...skillfully and digitally breathed into Kong in a way not seen before. Kong seemed to act as a natural animal with only occasional moments of seemingly human characteristics for the viewer to glimpse and relate to.  Of course we all have to suspend reality to enjoy such a fanciful story that obviously flies in the face of known science but who cares?  After all, a few hours of entertaining diversion is precisely why we enjoy this genre of film in the first place...right?  Enjoy this ""King Kong"" for what it is....a first rate piece of movie making that pays loving and respectful homage to a modern myth borne of the fertile imagination of one Merrian C. Cooper and is certain to resonate somewhere deep within the human psyche as long as stories are told."	4.0	Finally...  a Movie for movie fans!	2006-04-05	3	2	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A25QT0I4RLTNEJ	Ringo V.	I think it is safe to say that the original King Kong is a classic. It is in a class all it's own. Does the Peter Jackson remake do it justice? Absolutely.First of all, the acting. It's great. I've never seen Naomi Watts like this. She is just as talented as she is pretty. Now, I'm not a big Adrien Brody fan, but in this movie, he does quite well. Jack Black does a fantastic job as the cocky, dishonest, unstoppable movie director Carl Denham. Andy Serkis shines also, both as Kong and Lumpy the Cook.The special effects are absolutely stunning. King Kong is an amazing piece of CGI art. The Longneck Stampede scene is phenomenal, though many would beg to differ. The Kong vs. 3 T-Rex scene was good too.The classic scene of Kong fighting the WW1 planes atop the Empire State Building was phenomenal.I'd give it five stars if it wasn't for the length. It's definetely worth it, but buy a large popcorn to tide you over.	4.0	Great movie, just a little drawn out.	2005-12-17	5	3	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1F1FOR46702YF	R. J Rey	"Award-winning director Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) gives new life to the 1933 classic with the stunning big-budget remake ""King Kong"". In the 1930s, ambitious filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black) persuades his new leading actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) on an unsuspected film expedition to the mysterious Skull Island inhabited by prehistoric creatures. The expedition discovers a 25-foot gorilla that falls for the beautiful actress. ""King Kong"" is an outstanding visually dazzling thrill ride. The 188-minute remake remains quite faithful to the original film. The story feels over the top but certainly engrossing. The 2005 adventure film truly grabs the audience with its heart-pounding action sequences, good performances, elaborate backgrounds and sensational special effects. The 2005 remake also stars Colin Hanks, Andy Serkis, Thomas Kretschmann and Academy Award winner Adrien Brody. ""King Kong"" received overwhelming positive reviews from US critics, grossed over $550 million worldwide and won three Academy Awards (Visual Effects, Sound Mixing and Sound Editing).If you really enjoyed this action-packed remake of the 1933 fantasy classic in theaters, then check out ""King Kong"" on DVD. The three-hour blockbuster is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a splendid video transfer with bright colors and terrific resolution. Its 5.1 Dolby Digital sound offers a fantastic listening experience. The DVD menus are quite excellent. If you're looking for extras then I strongly suggest purchasing the 2-Disc Special Edition over this simple release.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AHBNPMHDWZ7SB	RJ Smoove	"The story of King Kong is a classic piece of American Cinema. Peter Jackson has stated in the past that he grew up with a deep-seated love and adoration of the original King Kong from the early 1930's. So who better to direct a massive 3 hour plus story about a massive ape, than the man who made me fall in love with Middle Earth? Yes, Peter Jackson was probally one of the best things about this film. He may make very long movies, but at least they are also very entertaining and engrossing movies. King Kong does tend to run on quite a bit, due to possibly unnecesary scenes, like giant bugs for example, and the Extended Edition adds on even more. I can't say for sure that they were unnecesary, because they may have been in the original films. Then I would just sound stupid for calling them ""unnecesary"". Thank God they had the presence of mind to reserve some stuff for an extended edition though. Even with the footage some might call ""unnecesary"", I still found very much to appreciate in the story. I know the first thing alot of people say is, ""CGI takes away from a good story"", but definitely not this one.It was fresh and exciting for me to see Kong done so realistically, with modern technology (before it took over Hollywood). Kong himself, is so realistic, I had a hard time getting over how beautifully he was created. Everything from a wound he got in battle, to wet fur was gorgeous. It was an especially nice touch when he would breath on Ann, and her hair would blow in the air current. I also have to say that I was pleasantly surprised to see Jack Black in a more serious role. Some may disagree with me, but I think he did a fine job. As did both Naomi Watts, and Adrian Brody. None of the actors are more intriguing than Kong though. So while King Kong is far from a perfect film, I believe Peter Jackson and his team did a fantastic job of bringing this classic to a modern audience. Many people think that classics should never be remade, but I say if the movies are really that good, filmmakers should reintroduce them to younger generations with a modern look.What more is there to say about this flawless transfer that hasn't already been said a thouand time over? It truly is one of the pinnacles of the media format, and would (did) serves as a terrific reference disc. As a general rule of thumb, I automatically bump my extras rating up to a 3/5 if there is a commentary on the disc. That happens to be the only thing of real value on this disc, aside from the film iteself obviously. So I'll definitely be holding onto my 3-Disc DVD set. All in all though, I Highly Recommend this one!"	5.0	Peter Jackson's Passion Project	2012-08-13	4	4	0

The makeup and special effects are top rate, even haunting at times; giant man-eating insects and really eerie looking natives. Probably a little more than the average under 12 year old needs to see. The dinosaur stampede was a little hard to believe though, well done but hardly survivable. We're talking smash-city for everyone involved! Very touching at times, this Kong probably garners more sympathy than previous screen Kongs, and the New York scenes will keep you guessing; ""how'd they do that?"" Especially when you consider it was shot largely in New Zealand. Very well done, but not quite the box office runaway that was expected."	4.0	Best Kong Effects Of The Three	2006-04-28	2	2	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	RMurray847	"I am capable of liking and admiring movies of all shapes and sizes.  My favorites this year include CAPOTE and CRASH.  But sometimes nothing fits the bill for movie thrills better than an outstanding, outsized epic.  The kind of movie where you simply MUST see it on the large screen, with a large crowd.  This year, the ""epic"" films have been pretty disappointing.  Even crowd-pleasers like the third STAR WARS installment and WAR OF THE WORLDS mostly pleased at a surface level.  Others, like STEALTH, didn't please at all!KING KONG is satisfying on an emotional level.  It satisfies on a visceral, action-loving, special-effects level.  It pleases those who appreciate good acting and directing.  It simply WORKS.I'm dismayed at anyone who says the film is too long.  What the heck is wrong with sitting for three hours through something that is this rich, textured and exciting?  True, if it is three hours of boredom, you can get quite fidgety...but then again, 90 minutes of garbage will make me fidget too.  But if I've been immersed in a world so thoroughly conceived and presented, populuated by people who are interesting to know and engaged in a plot that is told in a gut-wrenching way...the movie seems short.  I won't say, ""I didn't want it to end,"" because in actuality, the film has a rich beginning, a thrilling middle and an emotionally wrenching end.  I had been taken through a complete story, and I didn't need more.  It was just right.I won't run down the plot.  But I will touch on some key elements.  First of all, the special effects are special. I was most blown away by the loving detail lavished on recreating depression-era New York City.  In the opening scenes, and in the big finale, NYC is beautifully rendered...I doubt we'll see it so loving done again.  It's a city on the brink of a collision between massive progress and massive poverty.  The new and shiny versus the old and decrepit.  Technology against a giant beast.The action sequences are like nothing you've seen before.  There's a protracted sequence when Kong battles three velocoraptor-like beings while trying to keep Naomi Watts alive.  It is breathtaking..in the best way...it makes you hold your breath.  Later, the sequence a top the Empire State Building is damn near perfect.  It feels so cold, lonely and primal up there, and Peter Jackson films everything from angles that quite literally leave you dizzy.  A couple of scenes were still a bit rough, though, to be fair.  The scene in which the explorers all flee from underneath the giant legs of a stampeding brontosauruses doesn't quite convince.  It shows it's green-screen seams.  But overall, this is some of the best stuff ever.  Kong himself is simply great...totally convincing.Jack Black is well cast in a part that isn't as much against type as some would claim.  A driven, unethical ego-maniac.  That's not such a stretch, is it?  Adrien Brody is quite nuanced in his role...which was smaller than I thought it would be, but well done.  Kyle Chandler has a smallish role as the ""star"" of Black's new film, and he's really funny.  But it is Naomi Watts' show...every scene she plays is done with whole-hearted conviction.  Her interactions with Kong make you forget totally that he was NOT in these scenes with her.  It all feels completely authentic...which for such an outrageous story is pretty amazing.  She feels like an ""old-time"" star...all modern mannerisms, all modern irony are gone.Also, the scene on a frozen pond in Central Park is brilliant.  If you have a dry eye during that one (or God-forbid, during the final scene between Watts and Kong) I do feel bad for you.Yes, the film requires an attention-span.  But it rewards with so many riches.  It is not a film for little kids, not because of the action, but probably because of the time it takes getting there.  I saw a lot of restless 8 or 9 year olds in the theater.  But I saw a lot of 13 year olds (including my own) totally enthralled.  And I even caught myself literally on the edge of my seat.  I NEVER do that...I'm far to ""cool"" to get that caught up in a film...but the epic KONG made me feel like a kid at his first movie again.  Thanks, Peter Jackson, for that feeling."	5.0	The year's best BIG movie!!	2005-12-20	4	3	1

Everything before getting to Kong Island. Before this was over, I was almost asleep. I'm a cheap-ass Scot. I'm resentful of paying good money for a movie and then going to sleep during it! That hasn't happened to me since The Dark Crystal.2. Naomi Watts NEVER shuts her mouth! Is she a mouth breather? Did Jackson direct her to always look pensive? After an hour (when I woke up), I was OCDing over this.3. Adrien Brody's nostrils are too big. What else can I say. Doesn't look good when I'm sitting in the theater looking up at a giant projection.4. The chase scenes go on and on and on... Seriously, dogs won't chase cars this far. I'm not sure why, but there's a reason for this.5. Shooting bugs off some one with a machine gun!!?? I can believe a 50 ft. ape, living dinosaurs, surviving a nuke in a fridge, but this goes beyond the Pale.6. Jack Black outruns a herd of dinosaurs. See # 4.7. King Kong is not scary, he's kind of cuddly. When you've got 21st Century special effects and fail to make a threatening monster something ain't right. For a director to have such an opportunity and then blow it is just plain sad. But Jackson had no one to blame but himself.	2.0	See the Merian C.

But thanks to CGI, I did like the emotions of Kong's face that other movies could not show. It is, perhaps, too long a movie that could have done without a few fight scenes and gory things that most younger people seem to thrive on. Just give me a good story, good script, and good acting.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"King Kong (Peter Jackson, 2005)I have to admit that I didn't really expect to like Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong; aside from not being a huge fan of the original (and I realize this is heresy for someone who's been a hardcore monster movie fan for almost forty years now), I wasn't entirely sure that Jackson, who really kind of got out of the monster movie business over a decade ago, could go back and make a good old-fashioned monster movie. More fool me; King Kong is everything a remake should be, and isn't everything that the glut of pale, unnecessary, and/or stupid recent remakes has been.What Jackson did with Kong was not to ""re-imagine"" it (as so many directors have recently been doing with horror films, much to their detriment; the remake of The Hills Have Eyes is testament to just how wrong these things can go) as to amplify the original; the movie runs almost twice the length of Merian C. Cooper's 1933 opus, but not because Jackson added subplots or what have you. He simply extended scenes (and, in one notable case, added a scene that is the subject of legend, deleted from the original after audiences had an averse reaction to it). The things pared from the original film were pared because they hinted at racism (Charlie the cook is still here, but he's now known as Choy, and has a much smaller role). And, aside from one other change, the resulting product is remarkably faithful to Cooper's original film, but is, in every respect, bigger. The effects are wonderful, and since this is a movie whose main attraction is the effects (and always was, even in 1933), that's the strongest recommendation I can give it.There is, however, that one change, and that's where Jackson's Kong becomes problematic. In the original, there was the big ape, and there was Ann Darrow (Fay Wray/Naomi Watts). Ape meets girl, ape falls for girl, girl is scared of ape, girl comes to see that ape isn't such a bad guy after all. The difference is that there was never a time in the original where Ann Darrow wasn't scared of Kong. Here, however, once Darrow comes to the realization that, hey, apes have feelings too, she obviously develops feelings for him as well. Now, this isn't a case of girl falls in love with ape, but girl obviously considers ape to be a thinking, rational being, and is alternately terrified and disgusted by the humans' actions towards the ape. This makes perfect sense given the attitude of humans towards animals in the two time frames when these two versions of the film were made. (I haven't seen the '76 remake of Kong in way too long, and so can't rope it into the discussion here.) This change in Darrow's character makes perfect sense, and for most of the film's length, I was all set to say that it's one of the changes that make this a better film than the original. Unfortunately, that all falls apart at the very end; the change in Darrow's reaction to Kong makes the immortal final line, which is delivered here verbatim from the original script, more confusing than anything. Now, I'm going to assume that everyone and their mothers has seen one version of Kong or another and expound on this, but on the off-chance you've been living on Skull Island for the past eighty years, and have never seen any version of King Kong, skip the next paragraph, which contains spoilers.""It was beauty killed the beast."" When Ann Darrow is still terrified of Kong, it makes sense. In one of the most memorable scenes form the original film, Kong, loose in New York, finds Ann Darrow and abducts her. Kong's whole idea is to get Darrow and go off somewhere that people aren't flying things around and shooting at him, so the two of them can live in peace, even if Darrow's not on board with that idea. All well and good, but it's Darrow's resistance, at least in part, that brings about Kong's death. In this version, however, Darrow's all about saving the ape. He doesn't abduct her-- she goes off and finds him, and tries to stop the airplanes by putting herself out there and yelling at them. (The idea of a five-foot-something woman shielding a twenty-five-foot ape with her body is ludicrous in the extreme, but it somehow works here; the pathos Jackson evokes in this scene is remarkable.) You get the idea that Darrow would be perfectly happy to cross the East River and, say, take up residence in the New Jersey Pine Barrens with her simian pal. Sorry, Pete, but this time, it was the airplanes.Okay, now that the rest of you have joined us, I've focused entirely too much on Naomi Watts (who is wildly inconsistent in her acting abilities, honestly, but really does an excellent job here) and Andy Serkis (who is not at all inconsistent in his acting abilities, and for whom I have an undying love) and not said a word about the rest of the cast. Another reason I avoided this movie is because I don't think it would be possible to stick together a bunch of actors I'm less inclined to want to see in a movie. (Oh, wait, someone did-- Horton Hears a Who. Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey in the same movie?) Adrien Brody is a good actor, but he takes the most godawful roles. Jack Black is not a good actor, and he, too, takes the most godawful roles. Jamie Bell? I got allergic to him after Billy Elliott. Thomas Kretschmann is a brilliant actor (viz. Der Untergang), but, like Brody, winds up in movies that are just painful to watch (viz. Immortel: Ad Vitam). And yet all of them have renewed my faith in their acting abilities in this movie-- yes, even Jack Black. His name on a film will not be an automatic ""no"" any more (the way Jim Carrey's or Steve Carrell's is). How did Peter Jackson manage to yank these performances out of these actors? I have no idea. But he did it. And he stuck them in a three-hour movie that plays faster than many two-hour movies I've seen. The start's a little slow, yeah, but once you get into it, wow. Jackson does, most certainly, still know how to direct a monster movie. And, with a few missteps, he certainly did a fine job on this one. *** "	4.0	I was wowed.	2008-03-25	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A361LE16VBQDP8	Robert Bezimienny	This film is over three hours long.  It takes an hour and ten minutes to see the monkey.  The CGI effects are good, but not perfect; in particular the recreation of Depression-era Manhattan has a digitalized patina, and the multifarious dinosaurs look a little toy-like - Kong, however, is very well done.  The story makes very little sense, certainly no more than in the original movie, and no attempt is made to make it coherent - one can only assume that its logic is meant to be that of a dream.  Unfortunately, listening to someone recount their dreams is notoriously tedious, and so it is here.  Natives appear and disappear, brontosauruses and leeches come and go, and Kong brushes off tyranosaurus rexes and bullets galore but succumbs to a spear in the leg and a bottle of ether; the crew of the ship is seemingly infinite, providing bloody cannon-fodder, and while their navigational skills seem impaired on the outward journey, homeward bound they contrive to save not just themselves but Kong as well; aeroplanes fly sufficiently close to Kong for him to grasp them from the sky, and Naomi Watts is fabulously free of a fear of heights.  Of course, a dream leaves little room for character development and the humans all remain much less human than the ape. With no sympathetic human character to empathize with the film becomes boring.  Perhaps if Naomi Watts fattened herself up a little and found a better line of amusing small talk then things would have been all right.  As it was, I was rooting for the ape and, as we all know, he didn't do so well, so only two stars.	2.0	Special effects in need of decent characters...	2005-12-25	6	4	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3E1N2J6DHGXL4	Robert Gamble	"After seeing this movie (and while seeing this movie), the one thought that kept coming to mind was:""If every scene had been chopped by 2/3 it would have been a pretty good movie.""The best example of this would have to be the Kong vs T-Rex trifecta.  Disregarding how all the animals in question managed to come out of each individual attack unscathed until the final death came (no broken bones, no cuts, etc) and disregarding how Kong manages not to hurt or kill the female lead while protecting her (I know _I_ always grip a bit too hard when trying to grab something that's falling) and how she managed to come out uninjured with everything going on around her... the scene was just too long and repetitive.  The final Empire State building scene took too long also, especially the final 'slide off the building'.I've seen a repeated claim of disbelief that some people found the movie boring.  Yep, there's enough action for three movies.  I won't deny that.  But action for the sake of action, with no suspense, is boring to me.  Suspense for me requires a couple of things: realism within the film, and emotional connection (good or bad) to the characters.The first part, realism within the film, is often referred to as suspension of disbelief.  Now, some people keep saying ""King Kong is a FANTASY movie"" and believe that that suffices.  They might say that the scenes in Star Wars are far more unbelievable, especially people jumping from catwalk to catwalk, sometimes with great elevation changes, yadda... But Star Wars IS a fantasy movie, and it has an explanation WITHIN THE FILM, 'the Force' and the fact that the characters in these amazing light saber duels are trained in it, allowing them to defy gravity, block shots from laser pistols, etc.  Yes, the Force doesn't exist in our world, but if you accept that it does in Star Wars, the movies are relatively consistent with this premise.So what do we have in King Kong, which other than a giant Ape, seems to be based in the 'real world'.  Overweight cameramen carrying a heavy piece of equipment, running underneath of dinosaurs, avoiding dinosaurs, rocks, etc, all tumbling past him, for 10-15 minutes.  Oh yeah, and a heap of other ordinary folks all doing the same.  We have a beast that can be killed by bullets (albeit LOTS of them from planes), completely unaffected by a T-Rex's jaws clamped on his arm, something that should have at least severed some nerves and certainly should have had the arm bloody.  We have a beast apparently able to keep his attention on three dinosaurs and the absolute best place to hold the blonde to keep her from being injured, never mind that any one of umpteen gyrations he makes should probably have snapped her neck.  I'm sorry, but completely inconsistent action (in this case inconsistent with a relatively close to 'real world' - as far as we're told, there's no 'Force' to allow all of  the absurdities that occur) for the sake of action is just... boring.There WERE moments that made me remember this was the same director that created such a visual masterpiece in Lord of the Rings, such as the first imagery of Kong after his capture having exactly the right impact: the unthinking masses thinking he looked so amazing while the viewer is struck by how pathetic he looks compared to when he was free.I think the true problem is, Peter Jackson is perfectly suited to creating epic films and perhaps is unable to _not_ film every scene as if it's a potentially world shattering moment.  Lord of the Rings was an epic story, and as such benefited from this kind of attention.  King Kong is not an epic story, and as such, for me at least, simply didn't work when Jackson tried to turn it into one.(And heading off any comments about my attention span, I love slower paced movies, like ""Unbreakable"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Contact"".)"	2.0	A Non-Epic Story With Epic Length Scenes	2006-10-31	21	9	12
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A318WYJAZLK9B3	Robert Holmes Weymouth	"The first hour is slow but once Skull Island is reached, Kong provides us with one thrill after another.  Here is a spoiler, Kong after shaking the crewmen from the log, rushes to save the heroine from not one, but three T-Rex terrors.  It is the greatest fight between creatures ever captured on film.  Earlier homage was paid to the original Kong by reference to a ""Fay"" meaning Fay Raye and that she was making a movie for ""Cooper"" meaning Merrian C.Cooper.  When his name is mentioned, a musical motif from the orignal briefly sounds.The fight with the T-Rexes is incredible and Kong shows why he is king of that island.  The effects are terrific and when Kong ends up one on one with the lone surviving T-Rex, he approaches the beast with a huge roar, beating his chest, immediately seizing the Rex by the jaws and after struggling, kills him in identical fashion to the original.  He then stands atop the final and finally dead T-Rex and beats his chest, roaring his triumph for all to hear.A great remake with good but not great casting, I rate it five stars because the action (especially the fight and the scene in the darkness under the fallen log) is superb.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"After I saw KING KONG I tried to think of a better remake in the history of Hollywood.  John Carpenter's THE THING is one candidate, but neither it nor the Howard Hawks original (Hawks isn't listed as having been involved with THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE, but the listed director said that Hawks was the key figure, corroborated by others) are really substantial enough to challenge.  THE MALTESE FALCON is a greater film, but though it was the second film based on Dashiell Hammett's novel by the same name, it was more a second adaptation of the novel than a remake of SATAN MET A LADY.  There have been some great adaptations of one movie to another, such as THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN of THE SEVEN SAMURAI or A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS of YOJIMBO, but adaptations are very distinct from remakes.  I think this remake takes the crown for two reasons:  it is a very good movie in its own right and it is a remake of an undisputed classic.There was, of course, another major remake of KING KONG, the 1976 horrific version that nearly destroyed Jessica Lange's career.  The film pretty much made hash of the original story, turning it into a weird ecological exploitation flick and ending with Kong on the World Trade Center rather than the Empire State Building.  This version is incredibly respectful of the original, sets the action at the time of the original, and constantly makes references to it.  There are many scenes that visually quote from the previous classic, none more moving than at the end of the spectacular scene in this one where Kong fights three T-Rexes to save Naomi Watts's character from extinction.  Kong punches the last T-Rex, tries to kill it by prying open its jaw, then punches it again before successfully breaking the jaw.  Then, he reaches under the jaw and flips it up a couple of times.  All of this was a direct quote from the original.I'm going to be honest.  When I first heard that Peter Jackson's next project after THE LORD OF THE RINGS was going to be a remake of KING KONG, I was quite upset.  There was, I felt, no demand for such a thing.  Why remake a classic instead of merely doing a film on original material.  I was wrong.  This was for me the most purely entertaining movie of 2005.Almost everything about this movie stands out.  The set and art design is perfect, the special effects are off the chart, and even the clothing is great.  Every shot in the entire film is just a delight to look at, from the shots of the docks and boat at the beginning to Skull Island to the wonderful shots in the jungle to the final scenes in 1930s New York.  It is filled with special effects, but unlike a George Lucas film where the special effects call attention to themselves, here they are subservient to the story.  CGI has gotten so good that you simply do not have the visual capability not to believe what it shown on the screen.  Kong himself was impossible to doubt, all the way down to his big belly and bad teeth.I had some initial doubts about Jack Black playing the role originally played with bombastic glee by Robert Armstrong, but he allayed my doubts.  Though he lacks Armstrong's panache in delivering the film's final famous line (""It wasn't the airplanes; it was beauty killed the beast.""), he plays Carl Denham with enthusiasm and energy.  Adrian Brody is serviceable as Jack Driscoll (played by Bruce Cabot in the original), as are all of the supporting cast members.  But the person who steals the film by doing a very believable turn as ""the most adorable woman in the world"" is Naomi Watts.  I have always liked Watts, but I had absolutely no conception that she could be this irresistible or this astonishingly gorgeous.  In watching her, one wonders not how a giant gorilla could fall for her charms, but how anyone could fail to.  Although everything is very well done in the film from the photography to the design to the direction to the CGI, without Naomi Watts and the clear, blue-eyed beauty of her face, it wouldn't have been the film that it turned out to be.Although the film is a faithful remake of the original--all the way to reinserting a scene in which many from the ship's crew fight with bugs at the beginning of a ravine that was excised from the original when the studio deemed it too frightening (in the original spiders only)--Jackson does update the story in a couple of important ways.  Primarily this consists of changing Kong's basic character and then changing the relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow.  In the original Kong is presented as a lascivious, terrifying monster, completely devoid of any higher qualities.  In the uncensored version of the original Kong partially undresses Darrow with a look on his face that can only be described as lascivious.  Nothing approaching this can be found in the remake, which opens the possibility for Darrow to have a more complex relationship with Kong.  Fay Wray's Darrow could respond to Kong only with terror.  When Watts's Darrow is threatened by a three T-Rex's, Kong comes in as Darrow's savior.  The ensuing battle--one of the great achievements of the CGI age of film--with Kong heroically doing all in his power to save Darrow from the predators as they all fall off cliffs, hang from vines, and battle over the ground, with Darrow every second just inches from death, completely transforms the dynamic between Darrow and Kong.  If the remake does not contain the raw sensuality of the original, it contains a degree of affection impossible before.  The bond between Ann and Kong is reinforced at the end of the movie.  In one of the few completely original scenes in the remake, Kong and Ann find a few moments to recapture the friendship they established in the jungle when they slide around on a frozen pond in Central Park.  Then in Kong's final moments, Ann does all that she can do to try and save Kong's life.  While Fay Wray ended the film with relief that Kong was dead, Watts suffers a great sadness.  I think that in all this the new film greatly improves on the original.The final difference between the two films is that in the original Kong's presence in New York is primarily an occasion for horror, while in the remake it is a tragedy, with Kong as the most tragic figure.I have numerous friends who have expressed a total disinterest in seeing this film.  I suspect that there are many others and many may share my earlier antipathy to seeing a remake of such a familiar movie.  I strongly urge any doubters to give this film a chance.  It truly is one of the great remakes in film history, if not the greatest.  For me, this film reminded me of the reason we all go to the movies in the first place, to be taken to impossible places and witness miracle things.  I won't say this was the best movie I saw in 2005, but it was the most entertaining."	5.0	Arguably the finest remake in Hollywood history	2006-02-04	8	5	3

The film won 3 Oscars, for sound editing, sound mixing, and visual effects... It is set in 1933 where America was facing economic troubles unlike any seen before...Jackson wanted 1933 New York to be very, very authentic... He recreates a chaotic, crazy, busy city bustling and vibrant... The streets were absolutely jam packed with cars, trams, buses, crowded with hawkers and thousands of people ... The Empire State Building had just been built...Jackson goes in the heart of New York and describes the Depression by showing private security forces raiding buildings; mass evictions of people who simply could not pay their rent; people winding up as squatters; and long line of people waiting to be fed...He gives a little hint about the Prohibition: police busting up an illegal still; Carl Delham getting a box of whiskey to take upon his trip and it's labeled ""Lemonade."" And oddly enough, he presents the end of Prohibition, when we see some liquor advertising at the climax of the movie that wasn't there at the beginning...Jackson also introduces vaudeville... Vaudeville was a variety show, a string of acts put together to form a complete bill of entertainment... Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) was one of vaudeville good-looking actress who loses her job due to the lack of money...Skull Island was another very important location for Jackson... The amount of imagination and creativity that went into the ideas behind it is quite amazing... The zoology, the flora and fauna, the cultural history of that impossible island is thrilling... It was, indeed, a huge work to rebuild a hellish place of inexhaustible mysteries...We are talking about small group of desperate souls eking out the barest existence possible... Natives who have come to worship a giant gorilla--named ""Kong"" by them-- as some sort of god, practicing human sacrifice to appease his anger...We are also talking about a lush jungle and tropical rain forest with giant reptiles with very large feet to cope with the uneven and broken terrain of the island... We are talking not only about dinosaurs but also beasts just as terrible, or even worse... We're talking about a natural predator trap full of rotting carcasses and scavenger creatures... We are also talking about giant, parasitic, warm-like creatures which are much more than active predators and scavengers... We are talking about perils resided not only in the depths of the island but in the skies as well, where terrifying flying creatures ruled...""King Kong"" delivers a fantasy-adventure piece, with its balance of peril and romance in much the same way ""Titanic"" did... The romance part is not where one would expect it, but involves a beast with a beautiful and fragile creature who experience a tender if unexplained bond... And this union is the finest moment of the film... Ann looks into the ape's eyes and sees something impressionable there... And the audience notices it too... Jackson has done something emotional here... In addition to the ape's beastly character, Kong gazes at Ann and shows true, endearing traits... We are struck by his protective nature as we can understand the desires of each to protect the other... Ann can't escape this fateful meeting that changes everything... It's as if her whole life has been a prelude to this moment...Jackson's ""King Kong"" is a grandiose thrilling adventure, sufficiently magical and colorful whether it's reverently watching a sunset, or doing some ice-skating ..."	4.0	When Kong got to the top of the Empire State Building, at least for a few minutes, he was the king...	2007-01-03	2	2	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2TYJ5W3TLWK96	Robert S. Moyer	"I liked King Kong... a lot.  And purists forgive me, I think this is the definitive version of the story.  But sometimes less is more and it's personified here.  Ok, first the good.  The special effects and take on Kong are incredible.  He looks like an ape - not a man in a monkey suit - and he acts like an ape.  There are scenes where I swore I was watching a National Geographic special (save for the gargantuan size of the animals involved).  As Ann Darrow, Naomi Watts was phenomenal.  And I loved the moments where Kong treated Ann like a rag doll.  Past versions of Kong always had the ape treat Ann with respect and awe immediately.  Watt's Ann needs to earn Kong's trust.  It's much more believable in almost a Dian Fossey kind of way.  Oh, and Jack Black does a fine job of channeling Orson Wells as a driven (mad?) filmmaker.Now the bad.  Where the hyper reality of the ape effects worked well, the hyper reality of 1933 New York left me cold.  The last time I saw this much attention to detail in a film was the boat in Titanic.  Every bolt was accounted for, every plane of glass was there.  It should have felt real, but it felt like I was looking at a museum replica of the city, not NYC itself.My other major complaint was the over abundance of sub-plots.  The original King Kong treated the sailors as anonymous victims. Here, the pendulum swings the other way and we know more about the crew, but it is all extraneous.  For example, we meet Jimmy, the former stowaway and now crewmember of the Venture.  Nothing he did or said forwarded the story.  If his scenes were cut, the pacing would have been improved and the audience would not have missed a thing.  As it was, it felt like Jackson was more interested in fooling us into believing that we were looking into a fully fleshed out past, rather than sticking to the tragic romance at the core of Kong.So my complaints aren't about the running time.  I love a long movie if there is enough story to support it.  Lawrence of Arabia, Gone With the Wind, the original and extended editions of the LOTR.  These are wonderful stories that need 3 plus hours to tell.  King Kong simply isn't.Here's to hoping that if Jackson does a ""special edition"", he tightens up this movie, instead of adding to it.  It's already too bloated.  Trim away the excess and this King Kong will be the classic he wanted it to be."	4.0	A great movie stuck in a merely good one...	2006-04-04	2	2	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1O6T6SYB8HFC2	"Robert Twain ""Rob"""	"King Kong is one of the best movies of 2005 as Peter Jackson gives an excellent follow-up to his wildly successful Lord of the Rings series. This movie takes full advantage of special effects and other technology to bring Kong to life as well as some other creatures. With excellent lead performances and beautiful scenery and shots, King Kong is a needed remake of the 1933 classic.Naomi Watts is outstanding as Ann Darrow, a struggling actress who accepts the lead role in Carl Denham's new picture. Denham, played by Jack Black, is also struggling in the movie business. When Ann accepts the role ""she was born to play"", the two set off with screenplay writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) to Skull Island, an undiscovered island that supposedly holds primitive life, where Denham wants to shoot his film. When they reach Skull Island, the crew is immediately confronted by natives, who capture Ann and take her to be sacrificed to a monster that lives on the other side of a stone wall built along the edge of the native civilization. When Ann is taken by Kong, Jack Driscoll plays the unlikely hero trying to save her, while Denham sees a scheme to make money out of the venture after all.Watts does an excellent job with the whole aspect of fearing Kong and attempting to make sure he doesn't eat her by various methods. The two form a surprisingly close bond. Unlike the 1933 film, the attraction is not just from Kong, it is mutual. Andy Serkis, who used motion capture technology to play Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, makes another excellent performance playing Kong. He captures the ape's emotions wonderfully, especially when he laughs at Ann's Vaudeville routine.This film is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen. 1933 New York City has never looked this good, especially the view from atop the Empire State Building. These beautiful shots are completed by surprisingly moving moments, like when Kong and Ann watch a sunset from a high cliff, or when they share their final moment together on the Empire State Building, where Kong is trying to protect her from her own species. The end is heartbreaking, with Naomi Watts playing the best few minutes of running time in her career.Peter Jackson does an excellent job bringing  Kong to life in this remake of the 1933 classic. The performances and scenery are great, there are enough creepy creatures and action scenes to keep us on the edge of our seats, and there are enough tender moments to strengthen the emotional relationship between King Kong and Ann.

The script wasn't as good as it could have been, but it's a very powerful emotional film and that sort of makes up for a great deal of that.Some people complain about the first half being so long. I personally don't see the problem.... When you get into a good script combined with such an emotional film, you usally don't want it to end. The naysayers seem to just have a short attention span.Not alot of B movie cheese here thank god. This movie shows a good, but brief love between King and Watts. It reflects how some real relationships can work... Despite him making a huge mess and destroying everything, she is able to the good in King as he shows he will go to any lengths to keep her out of harms way. And the relationship between the two really pulls you into the film.The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because the script could have been a touch better and we get basically nothing for extra features.That last reviewer ""Two thumbs up your butt""Wow!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1H1P8VZRDLMV5	"Rocky ""hillking"""	Many people who want to see the movie are actually looking for its special effects. Like Spiderman, Batman, Hulk, War of the worlds, everyone knows the story. Why people still want to see the old old story and spend many hours for someone to tell the old old story again and again? The reason is all about arts.For most of Peter Jackson's movies, you can randomly pick some scences to make them wall paper without modificaitons. It's just so good. Talking about shooting, the position of the camera and the movements are always so good. If you are like me who like digital photography so much, you will know how difficult to shoot those fantastic scence and make them fit the story.Nobody including An Lee and Steven Spielberg can beat him in terms of the shooting skills and creation of fine art pictures.Technically, the difficult to create KingKong is 1000 times more than dinosaurs and hulk stuff. If you know 3D animation like me you will know the skills to create those millions of hairs and let them move with KingKong's movement and facial expressions are just incredible. The technology in this movie is second to none.Just like the end of the lord of rings, the beginning of the story is so long and some people don't appreciate it.That kind of time is just like the blank in the traditional Chinese water-ink drawings or the quiet period in classical music. It just gives time to fullfill the characters and tell all the details of the story. If you really like to get involved into the fair tale story then you will understand his effort to make you in the fantacy world. But if you are just looking for some eyepopping video game like scences, those would make you yawn.After all, this is a hands-down masterpiece. Not for its story, but for its arts and craftwork.	4.0	The reason that it is a masterpiece	2006-04-02	5	3	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"***1/2With this second remake of the 1933 classic, ""King Kong,"" director Peter Jackson seems to have forgotten the cardinal rule of the monster movie genre: keep it simple and keep it short.  What with a budget of $207 million and a running time of three hours and seven minutes, Jackson has turned what could have been a dynamic, tightly wound B-movie thriller into a turgid A-movie opus whose whole adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.  However - and this is a big however - some of those parts are so absolutely extraordinary that I find myself strongly recommending that people go see it despite any reservations I might have about the film overall.Most people are already familiar with the story of the unscrupulous and shamelessly self-promoting filmmaker in the 1930's who takes his cast and crew to a mysterious location called Skull Island to shoot his latest picture.  While there, they encounter a bizarre, prehistoric world ruled by a giant ape who takes a serious liking to the beautiful blonde starlet, Ann Darrow, who is offered up as a sacrifice to him by the terrified natives.  When the crew members are finally able to rescue her and subdue the beast, they take him back to New York where Carl Denham, the director, turns him into a lucrative freak-show attraction for the well-to-do in Manhattan.  But it's not all that easy to keep a feisty, 50-foot gorilla down when he's being mistreated, as the city seen learns to its everlasting regret.The film has been subconsciously divided up into three distinct sections of virtually equal length and utterly unequal quality.  The desultory first hour, with its tongue-in-cheek dialogue and its winking-at-the-camera performances, feels less like a remake and more like a parody of the original.  However, once the characters disembark onto the island, Jackson's skills as an action movie director come into play and he is able to generate some genuine excitement in the jungle scenes.  However, even here, repetitiveness and wretched excess become the order of the day as our intrepid little band of adventurers, who have gone in search of their kidnapped companion, do battle with one grisly creature after another.  In fact, the characters encounter so many dinosaurs in Kong's world that at one point we feel as if we've somehow wandered into the coming attractions trailer for ""Jurassic Park IV.""But it is in the final third of the film that the elements really come together and the movie approaches something akin to greatness.  The scenes of Kong in New York have such a remarkable excitement and poignancy about them that they begin to clear away all the critical thoughts we might have had about the movie up to that point.  All the earlier build-up finally pays off as we see the bewildered beast tearing up a city, then falling under a hail of fatal bullets all for the sake of the woman he loves.  New York City itself has never looked better than it does in this movie, and the images of Kong standing atop the Empire State Building as planes circle menacingly around him are eye-popping and beautiful to behold.  Much of the credit for the emotional wallop in the film's final act goes to Naomi Watts whose lovely performance, coupled with the beautifully expressive face of the computer-generated Kong, convinces us that there is a genuine love and attraction between this beauty and this beast.  The nice thing about this section of the movie is that the special effects, spectacular and breathtaking as they are, are primarily there to serve the human interest aspect of the story, a rarity in any film in which FX play such a crucial part.  The other actors are considerably less effective in their roles, particularly Adrien Brody, whose stiff performance as Jack Driscoll, the writer and human love interest to Ann, is indicative of what a badly written role it is.  It's small wonder that her romance with the ape is more compelling and convincing than the one with Jack.  Jack Black gives a wildly uneven performance, but he does engage our interest occasionally so he deserves some credit for that.And, indeed, ""uneven"" is probably the operative word for this film.  Suffice it to say that you will really be seeing three movies in one here.  The first is tedious and dull, the second occasionally gripping but far too repetitious, and the third absolutely smashing and spectacular.  Given the quality of much of what Hollywood produces these days, one out of three ain't really all that bad."	3.0	uneven spectacle that leads up to a splendid finale	2006-01-29	7	2	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AFK33DILKFPWX	Ronald J. Weed	"I rented his movie to see the CG effects, which looked awesome in the early trailers. I expected little from the plot. What a pleasant surprise! Director Jackson found a way to add layers of detail and subtlety to an implausible story. By putting together a stellar team of creatives, and actors, Jackson has turned a ""B pic"" cult movie into a ""A class"" film.Making a story about a giant gorilla is certainly dicey. Turning that gorilla into a sympathetic character is a seemingly impossible task. Jackson carefully crafted a story line depicting a lonely giant that has a gentle side. Part of this gentle side is love of beauty. Whether it is Naomi Watts character, or a beautiful sunset. This drive turns the monster into a sympathetic character.Special attention should be given to the direction of the story boarding. Few films have demonstrated such frame by frame compositional perfection.Then there is the look of the film, which carefully recreates the depression era. Exceptional scene lighting sets the mood together with a subtle music score.Finally there is the actors. Naomi Watts is exceptional as the lead Ann Darrow, both in look and acting ability. This is, without a doubt, the most important casting choice of the movie. To pull off the emotional impact of the story, it is critical that the relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow work. Watts hit a home run. The other part of this unusual(?) relationship was brilliantly achieved, via the efforts of Andy Serkis. Serkis acted out the role of Kong, just as he did Golem in Lord of the Rings.The rest of the cast is similarly effective both in looking the part and in acting ability.This kind of depth of talent on both the acting side, and the creative, is rare. Fortunately the powers that be, in Hollywood (those who make the money decisions), have been willing to invest in such large talent pools. I am going to use another sports analogy: Enough money will buy you a football team. If however, you want to win a superbowl, you need a special group of individuals. You need people, who are willing to do more then just put in a performance. You need people willing to pull out all the stops. This group did just that, and in doing so, created a genre masterpiece."	5.0	Peter Jackson the Genre Master	2007-02-12	2	1	1

The special effects were awesome but as VanHelsing proved , it takes more than that to make a good film. There was just too many scenes that were over the top and unrealistic, like the Brontosaurus scene with our actors running between their legs but incredibly never getting hurt. Cmon guys. In the end You never really care enough about Kong to get sad because there were too many scenes that were ridiculous. The most important element to the film was the romance between woman and beast, and this could have worked, in fact I was praying it would, but it failed because there were too many implausible scenes earlier on, too many ridiculous scenes involoving humans outrunning dinosaurs and what not. Worth seeing,  but Ive got to give it a thumbs down. More than anything I was disappointed.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A13D4E28S63SYF	"Ron ""true faith"""	"The things I liked about ""King Kong"" were the dazzling special effects and the personification of Kong.  Peter Jackson should've just focused on the love relationship between a beauty and a beast (aka Ann Darrow and King Kong) and the commerce and greed of the film director (aka Carl Denham), and forget about everything else.Overall, I found ""King Kong"" to be an overblown, repetitive and unfocused film.  This is what happens when you give an Oscar-winning director carte blanche to do whatever he wants to do.  He tags on an additional 90 minutes to the original with nothing of importance to say.The first hour is extremely boring.  Who cares about knowing every Tom, Dick and Harry on the ship?  As far as I'm concerned, the three main characters were Kong, Ann Darrow and Carl Denham.  Since Kong was not on the ship, Jackson should've just developed the Darrow and Denham characters.  I really didn't care about the Captain, the Jamie Bell character nor the conceited actor.  (You see, I don't even remember the names of these characters because that's how insignificant I felt they were.)  A lot of these characters could've been edited out.I liked the budding relationship between Ann Darrow and Kong during the second hour.  However, I found most of the fight scenes to be nonsensical and repetitive (except for the ones that involved Kong).  A lot of these fight scenes could've been edited out.I actually didn't have any problems with the final and third hour because it concentrated on Carl Denham, Kong and Ann Darrow.  ""King Kong"" could've been a much more stronger and powerful movie if the film editors had done their jobs.  But because I enjoyed the special effects and the personification of Kong, I decided to give it 2 stars."	2.0	Did we see the same movie?	2006-02-20	41	14	27

The only minor objection was the over long and totally unbelievable section, when they were all running in a herd of Brontosauruses, as if they all would not have been crushed to death.

All hell breaks loose, to the point where you can hardly stand one more knock-your-socks off chase or reptilian battle.  Of course Kong and Naomi Watts are the star attractions here, and they are mesmerizing and, yes, heartbreaking together.  The movie is too long by an hour, and things take far too long to get started, but the final hour moves quickly, and the finale is expertly rendered.  I was disappointed in Jack Black's deer-in-the-headlights performance; not enough going on in that face.  But Kong is a miracle of CGI; he is more complex emotionally than almost anyone human in the film.  And Naomi Watts is luminous, and does perhaps the best job ever on film of someone working against a blue screen - the alliance these two improbable creatures form is as surprisingly stirring as it is fantastic.	4.0	BIG AND LONG	2005-12-17	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3BAOIC7JMCY6R	"RPK ""Professional Shark Tamer"""	"When people hear the name ""King Kong"" they instantly think of a giant monkey that climbed the empire state building with a screaming blonde in his oversized (and opposible thumbed) hand, but when I think of King Kong the first thing I think of (as cheesy as it may sound) is love.King Kong is (above and beyond all the action and CGI) a love story.The movie begins with aspiring actress Ann Darrow (played by the ethereal and spot-on Naomi Watts) being offered a part in a major motion picture being filmed by Carl Denham (played by Jack Black-who I think was a little bit miscast in this role). Ann takes the offer reluctantly and boards the dirty, cargo ship along with the a whole crew of misled sailors, and Adrien Brody's character Jack Driscoll (who is the writer of the movie being filmed).The crew of the ship and the actors and film makers are soon voyaging across the sea, aimlessly searching for Skull Island, a mythical place that Carl is set on finding. When they DO find the island, the locals aren't so keen on them and bloodshed occurs shortly after. The primitive, dentally challenged tribe puts there sights on Ann and soon after she is kidnapped, tied up, and stolen away in the night by Kong.I don't really want to give too much away by going into a long, boring summary of what happens in the film, but instead will just point out the highs and lows of the movie.Peter Jackson (The Lord Of The Rings) has created another epic cinematic acheivement with Kong. The film is action packed. There is literally a 12 minute or so fight scene between Kong and a trio of nasty dinosaurs, a creepy battle between men and giant bugs, a dino-chase scene that blows Jurassic Park out of the water, and an ape running amuck in New York City.But, underneath all of the action, adventure and CGI effects, the best part of this film is the relationship between Ann and Kong.Naomi Watts does an excellent job building her friendship and love for Kong. She  geniously plays Ann with a mixture of whimsy, grace and innocence. Her belief in destiny and fate lead her emotions throughout the film, and that is truly a beautiful thing to see.Another interesing part of the movie was the budding romance between Jack and Ann. Adrien Brody plays the brainy-screen and theater writer with a very authentic 1940's feel. His odd, strange looks make him somewhat more relatable than any other mainstream stars would have been, which makes him likeable as Kong's main rival for Ann's affection. Jack and Ann share an obvious romance almost from the start, which adds a love-triangle element to the filmEventually, Ann finds that Kong, despite his monstrous stature and fearsome, chest pounding roars, is a big softy who only wants to protect and care for her.What would you do if you had been snatched up by a giant gorilla, after the fear and horror fade and you realize that the ""beast"" loves and cares for you? As a viewer, we are exposed to one woman's reaction to this. Ann fears Kong, but her feelings change after he constantly rescues her. You feel her blossoming love for him pour into your heart as she tries to explain the meaning of ""Beautiful"" as he gazes thoughtfully at a magnificant sunset.The two characters soon share a bond so strong that it can only be defeated by death.Most people know the way the story ends, and it IS tragic. Ann and Kong's love story will bring some viewers to there knees sobbing. You will smile as the Beauty and her beast share a heartfelt moment sliding on the ice in central park. You will gasp as Kong is pelted with bullets but still manages to protect his beloved Ann...and as she tries to return the favor for once, climbing the building and flinging herself in front of him, trying to stop the pilots from killing her beloved ape. And in those final moments when Kong looks lovingly at her with those sad, knowing eyes, you will surely cry...If you don't-you are probably dead inside! This movie is one of the saddest I have seen in a lonnnnnnng time. The dramatic and haunting score also adds some points to the overall quality of the film. James Newton Howard does a great job, especially at the more profound moments in the movie. The music playing as Kong slips away from the building to his fate as Ann hysterically cries, is one of the saddest scores I have heard in a while, and the song BEAUTIFUL is what it's named after. I would have given the movie 5 stars if they had knocked out some of the action/CGI and focused a lot more on the love story."	4.0	A heart-breaking love story	2006-12-13	5	4	1

Short ""robertsathard"""	"Despite its flaws I am a big fan of Peter Jackson's three hour overproduced, overblown version of ""King Kong"".  Being an owner of the two disc version of the original theatrical cut I have to say this three disc version isn't really necessary.First of all the extended scenes don't really add anything to the story.  We see enough weird creatures in the original cut attacking the hunting party that we don't need to see a another attack by a dinosaur nor do we need to see a giant swamp creature attacking the rescue party.  Not that these are bad scenes.  They are just kind of there.Now there is a scene towards the end of the movie in which a military guy gives an awful speech, ""This town was created by humans for humans and I am not gonna let some dirty ape destroy it"" Blah blah blah.  This was a bad scene and should have been included in the deleted scenes.Speaking of the deleted scenes, most of them are on the boat ride. Had Jackson including them the running time of King Kong would have been closer to four hours with at least another half an hour on the already long boat ride.As for the ""Making of"" documentaries:  If you've seen the extended versions of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies you might find these documentaries seem redundant.  And at almost every turn of production the phrase, ""This movie alone was much harder than all three 'Rings' movies combined"".  That is said about the building of each set, Andy Serkis acting as King Kong, and well, so many times I figure it to be hype.If you are a big fan of this flick just stick with the two disc version.

I think after the 2nd viewing Peter Jackson's King Kong just works it's way into your heart.  I bought the 3 disc version and enjoyed seeing how the movie was made.King Kong is the star of this movie. I love Jack Black's portrail of Carl Denham.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AMJPFNUKED92B	"R. T. Meisenholder ""Romanticist Philosopher"""	"By now we should all know the story of King Kong. It all hinges on whether or not you can believe that such a savage ""creature"" can actually fall in love with a beautiful woman and that she can love him, too. By the end of this 3 hour plus film you will be brought to tears if you have a heart. Peter Jackson pushes emotional buttons in much the way he did in the Lord of the Rings films so when you watch expect to gripped in a way only he can. It is a distinctly Peter Jackson film. The natives on Skull Island just remind me so much of the orcs in LOTR, too.Naomi Watts does a good job of showing her love for Kong in a way similar to the story of Beauty and the Beast. In fact the way this version of King Kong is put together does have some elements of Beauty and the Beast with Kong being tamed by a beautiful woman and a score of men hunting the beast because they fear him. Although the way this ends is decidely less uplifting but no less emotionally gripping than that fairy tale.You will want to see Jack Black dead by the end of the movie. He plays the movie producer that risks the lives of his crew to make a fortune. When that bombs with the death of several crew members and finally the destruction of the camera he hatches a scheme to capture Kong again for the sake of greed.On the negative side there seems to be too many sequences where the movie almost becomes Jurassic Park squeezed into the middle of the movie. We have Brontosaur type dinosaurs, small T-Rex type dinosaurs, and the classic huge T-Rex. The scene where Kong fights several T-Rexes in this version is quite awesome.On the technical side this HD-DVD offers wonderful picture quality and crisp Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 audio. I have no complaints there. It is a solid 4 stars out of 5."	4.0	Despite Being Too Long Still Delivers Emotionally	2007-01-06	3	1	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1NEOOMAP4BQDR	rucktoon	"The DVD is exceptional. The 2-Disc edition is worth it - I am only half-way through the Production Diaries on disc 2 and am so glad I sprung for it - can't wait to see the NY & Skull Island documentaries which are also on the disc. I don't think the Trailer is on either disc tho - too bad. If you're not a fan of the digital ""process"", get the single-disc edition. But I am absolutely amazed at how they did it all: just like the special features on the 1933 re-release DVD had me in awe of how the original film was created (that's a must-buy as well). I was worried that knowing how they did ""things"" would spoil the film, but the actors (except for Naomi Watts) already did that (haha). Kong is so real and convincing...the ending will break your heart everytime. No real spoiler here, but when Naomi walks into Brophy's arms at the end, I'm like No! Thelma! Jump off after Kong instead! Don't settle for a chimp! What an ending that would have been, huh?"	5.0	Should u buy the 2-disc Special Edition or not?	2006-04-14	1	1	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3QA33WMRZ3EYH	Russell	First the good:It's great to see the the Extended edition of this movie (in HD by the way) and not have to change the disc out half way through the movie. The picture quality is super clear and crisp, and the presentation is fantastic. This is obviously a movie that was made to be seen in HD, and it couldn't look better.Now the bad:The director's commentary with Peter Jackson and Phillipa Boyens is exactly the same as it was on the DVD version of this movie. Doesn't sound bad right? Well I mean that literally; its EXACTLY the same. Including the point where Peter Jackson tells you &#34;this is the end of commentary on the first disc,&#34; and a few seconds later starts with &#34;welcome back to the commentary, I hope you had some time to fix yourself a cup of tea...&#34; Truthfully, this isn't really all that bad, and I didn't expect them to record a new commentary for a re-release of the film on home video. But it is kind of weird to hear this knowing you don't have to change the disc. I suppose they could have re-editing the audio so that they cut this stuff out but then there would have been a long silence in between the scenes so, really, it's not that big of a problem.Now for the bad, no seriously this is bad:If you owned the DVD of the extended edition of King Kong then you'll know there were a couple of hours worth of behind the scenes documentaries included. Which appear to be nowhere to be found on this Blu-Ray. What is included is something called UControl, which will display an icon during the playing of the movie which you can select and then play a little behind the scenes clip. From the 4 or 5 of these I watched, they weren't really the same as the documentaries from the DVD, which might be cool except there is no option to only play these behind the scenes clips by themselves. You have to watch the movie in order to watch these clips. I'm the kind of person likes to play behind-the-scenes stuff while I do work but this Blu-Ray would require me to pay attention to it in order to watch any of this stuff.So in conclusion, great HD, kind of a commentary kink, and the behind-the-scenes features are not the same and presented in a bad way.If you were planning on tossing your DVD copy of the movie and replacing it with this Blu-Ray, think twice because it is not a perfect HD replacement.	3.0	King Kong Blu-Ray is So-so.	2013-04-08	2	1	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3AKPY4LXIC24O	Ryan Costantino	"Peter Jackson's take on King Kong is the best moviegoing experience I've had this year.  If you want to nitpick you can but the movie works too damn well.  Here's a list of how Kong gives the most bang for your buck of any movie released in 2005.1.  Fully developed characters that give you a reason to keep that gluteus maximus planted in that theater seat for the 3 hour plus duration.  Check. Jack Black's low key (but slightly frenetic) Carl Denham is believable and alternately despicable, and while I fully expected some type of Tenacious D freak out it never emerges (but you know it was there, in the back of his mind).  Adrien Brody as playwright/screenwriter Jack Driscoll gives us the quintessential workingman prototype without falling into cliche, and his heroism emerges from the workingman ethic (which only adds to the credibility of the character).  An unexpected Kyle Chandler (from the TV show Early Edition) plays the vain and shallow Bruce Baxter, the star of Denham's picture.  Andy Serkis gets to truly show his mettle as the wise sea dog cook, Lumpy (oh yeah he also plays a gorilla).  Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow gives the performance of her career.  In the past I've been on the fence about her, not feeling she truly deserved her ""star"" status.  I have since changed my mind.  Not only is she down right gorgeous but she acts her heart out, presenting the greatest display of onscreen make believe I've ever witnessed.  Remember, the big gorilla you see on the screen isn't actually there.2.  Eye-popping, mind-boggling special fx.  Check.  They may as well just give King Kong the Oscar for that category. While some of the green screen shots (especially during the stampede) can't quite convince the eyes, the amount of fx techno-dazzle is unprecedented.  Filmdom, the ante has been upped.  This is a creature fest of epic (and by epic I mean huge) proportions.  Dinosaurs, insects, arachnids, and bats.  The creepy crawlies abound.  Here is the escapist buffet that Hollywood execs should be learning from.  Make no mistake, King Kong is a film hybrid that rings of purity, an action yarn, a love story, an ode to the past, all wrapped in a horror movie shell.  While you won't believe everything you see in King Kong (and you shouldn't) you will believe in a good 90 percent.  1930's New York is eerily realistic and Kong is just, well Kong is just real.3.  One big monkey that somehow manages to simultaneously awe, frighten, and convey intelligence and nobility.  Check.  I was part of the school that called for recognition for Andy Serkis as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. That call must be raised again.  I loved the original '33 Kong and hated the first remake with it's unacceptable monkey suit.  This King Kong is the best of the bunch.  Arguably there is a little disparity between budgets alloted for each film, but all the money in the world doesn't guarantee a good movie.  The combination of motion capture with CGI is the best innovation to film in the past twenty years and Peter Jackson is it's reigning champion.  His reliance on the intuition and observation skills of Serkis is amply and beautifully rewarded.  Like Gollum, but in a grander sense, the fx used for Kong work because the audience is entrenched in empathetic emotional responses.  When the king of Skull Island is enraged we're furious right along with him, when he's amused we're chuckling as well.Much has been said and written about how the original King Kong inspired Peter Jackson to pursue film making as his career.  What hasn't been postulated is how Jackson's version quite possibly could be that catalyst for some bright eyed, imaginative child blossoming into a wunderkind director of the future.  I think Peter Jackson's King Kong has that potential to motivate beyond anything produced since the first Jurassic Park.  Perhaps in this speculative future dictionaries will be graced with poster art from this film right next to one word: Spectacle.If you want a startling reminder as to why we go to the movies buy a ticket to King Kong.  Whatever the ticket price you will be exponentially rewarded in entertainment value."	5.0	Long Live the King	2005-12-20	6	4	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2TPGCMRB816DQ	Ryan Orvosh	There is about an hour and a half of plot yet the movie is three hours long. Half the actors can't act, Naomi Watts does a fine job at making her character 1 dimensional and uninteresting. Even the special effects get tedious, just giant stuff just keeps attacking people and that's the movie they don't even make it very exciting. You just hope the characters get killed. There's about 10 people on the ship and then the number keeps changing, people and people who get killed just randomly reappear in the film. It's terribly bad, just because Peter Jackson made it doesn't make it great.	1.0	5 Stars? Don't think so.	2005-12-19	24	10	14

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AUUIKVBUMFUOB	Saga Fan	"The 3-disc ""Collector's Edition"" is clearly the best version of the 2005 King Kong on DVD. The extras are pretty much complete and you also get a ""director's cut"" of the movie. Unlike the long versions of the LOtR's films, this is a true ""director's cut"" - if possible, Jackson would have made this movie six hours long!Epic remake of 1933 classic is marred by Jackson & Co's typically inept writing, with centerless characters manipulated through contrived plot convolutions until the writers pull the plug on them. The film is now 90 minutes overlong, instead of a mere 60. Being a kid at heart, I welcome the extra dino-action, but expanded 'character' material adds nothing to the film, since the writers obviously never figured out who the characters really are or why they do any of the things they are made to do in the film.Visual effects are uneven but above average throughout. Kong himself benefits from the extreme compression of a television screen, looking far more convincing than he did on the big screen. The film is also packed to the gills with references to the original Kong and the 1976 remake (which I recommend). Jackson placed props from the original movie in his own sets and restaged some of its most iconic gags; and the gunner who kills Kong is none other than Rick Baker, famed makeup artist who portrayed Kong in 1976!Overall, for Peter Jackson fans or King Kong collectors, this is worth the price tag. For everyone else: stick to the 1933 original, which kids and adults still love!"	3.0	Best Edition	2006-11-17	7	3	4
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AE0V64WSSPK4R	S.A.I	One of my absolute favourite movies of all time and my best movie of 2005. I still recall my enchantment watching it in the theatre. Hands down, my best cinematic experience so far.It is a visual delight, an edge of your seat thriller, a love story of every sort and a laugh out loud comedy all rolled into one marvellous package.Peter Jackson is a genius. Spielberg is sooo yesterday. Peter Jackson is the new Steven Spielberg.Before King Kong, Naomi Watts was one of those actresses I see a thousand times and never remember. In Kong, she shines like a true star. She is beautiful physically and in her spirit and actively so.My favourite character however, just has to be the demented Carl Denham played to perfection by Jack Black who is no stranger to such roles but here, he takes it a notch further and it is a riot to watch his movie making passion degenerate into exploitative, desperate madness.Adrien Brody does an expected and usual fine job of being the noble, quiet and brave hero. I like him a lot but he does nothing new here.After watching it in theatres, I have seen this movie at least four or so times on dvd and each time is like the first time. Kong is a wonder. He is a hero and I love watching his love for Ann Darrow develop and blossom. His protectiveness is so endearing and the scene where Ann Darrow seeks his protection from the dinosaurs and Kong goes into alpha male mode shredding the dinosaurs to pieces is one of the highlights of the movie.On dvd however, I haven't been able to re-watch the scene where Kong gets killed. I just cant bear it and I hurt with Ann Darrow.I am very impressed by how tactfully and tastefully the relationship between Anna and Kong is treated. In our sex-drenched culture it could have easily degenerated into something perverse but it is instead sweet and affectionate.Any movie starring the very talented Jamie Bell is always worth my while even though he got nothing more than a bit part.I will be watching this dvd many more times and so should you.	5.0	Tore Kong	2007-03-20	2	1	1

I refuse to reveal much more: suffice it to say that Anne Darrow [the character created by Fay Wray] is more talented when created by Naomi Watts, Jack Driscoll [Adrian Brody] more believable than ""the 1st Mate"" in the original, & Jack Black more maniacal as the director who*willl not* be stopped no matter ... what?!!& Andy Serkus is awesome ... more than believable, he's heart-wrenching as the final survivor of a doomed race of magna-gorillas, w/soul-searing eyes & body language that makes mere vocalizations seem unnecessary.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A37S3ACL57LN62	"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra"""	King Kong is a film about a group of struggling film makers who venture to Skull Island, an uncharted land mass surrounded by mystery. Once docked, if one wants to put it that way, they find themselves up against natives, dinosaurs, and a gigantic ape named Kong who takes a fancy to the only female in the group. One man get the idea to trap Kong and take him to New York to use him for profit in a large production. Once there, the beast escapes, running loose in New York. He corners himself atop the Empire State building where he meets his demise.The cast is very good. None of them really stand out as being wonderful actors, but each are suited to their roles and do not detract from the film at all.This film is visually quite beautiful. The New York scenes, the island scenes, and the scenes on the ocean are all rather breath-taking at times. The CGI was not overused in the film and was done well so that Kong did not stand out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the cast. The giant ape is not revolutionary in this film as the original was in his film, but there has certainly been a large step forward technologically between the films.Peter Jackson was a fan of the original King Kong and made this film to pay tribute. Not only did he consult the original meticulously by contacting Fay Wray, the original Ann Darrow and by including some of the original cast and crew in this film as extras, but he added a significant amount of his own creative energy to the film. Because of this, the new version of King Kong is over 3 hours long instead of the 30s version's 110 minutes.  However, this is the downfall of the film. The beauty of classic cinema is that so much is said in such a short span of time. We all know that any film version of King Kong is going to be a spectacle; why try to add to that spectacle by bombarding the audience with more, more dinosaurs, more island scenes, more emotionalism, more everything? This only causes the film to drag on instead of flow and amaze.This new version of King Kong certainly stands on its own as a good film and because of the changed style of modern cinema compared to that of the original version, it seems like a completely different one. Depending on your taste, that can be either a good or a bad thing.	4.0	Long-Winded Tribute	2005-12-19	5	2	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A32XW50ILWOXNO	Samuel McKewon	"Let's get down to it: Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" is one jaw-dropping, gob smacking hour of amazing stuff sandwiched by two lesser segments, the first of which is a bit dull, while the latter a bit sentimental, mostly whiffing on the original film's visceral ending. But every second spent on Skull Island - from the landing on rocky cliffs, through the sunset to the capture of the giant ape -  pounds on the heart. When an adult who's seen more than 500 movies in a theater can still ask, with slight wonder, ""There's more?"" then Jackson has tapped into some vein of childhood that eluded him even in the ""Lord of The Rings"" trilogy. He's becoming the Babe Ruth of modern filmmaking, and his short porch in right field are all manners of beast and action. I'm more of a Ty Cobb/Roberto Clemente man myself, but you get the idea.The original ""Kong"" served as Jackson's Gatsby light, his muse and motivation, and his remake shoots for the moon, opening with a effective montage of Depression-era New York City before focusing on bit stage comedian Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts, just about perfect) a plucky girl struggling to eat, much less prosper. Soon she's out of a job, and on her way to a burlesque house, when she's discovered by Carl Denham (Jack Black) a filmmaker modeled after Orson Welles, although Denham (and Black, for that matter) has half the intelligence and pathos of that cinematic titan.Denham's really a minor hack of jungle films and second-rate romances in need of an actress to toss on a ship that will sail to a remote shoot. He sees Ann, correctly sizes her up as the saddest girl in New York, and convinces her to join the film by dropping the name of screenwriter/playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), on whom Ann has a crush - for his words, anyhow. They all board the tramp steamer Venture, nominally headed for Singapore - who knows how long, in the 1930s, that would take - but really going to Skull Island, supposedly uninhabited.The movie's first hour all buildup and backstory - Jack is trapped aboard the ship, makes sweet with Ann, while the crew of the Venture plans a mutiny against Denham. Jackson, frankly, is no Steven Spielberg with scenes like these; they're heavy-handed and overdone, and the director feels the need to use dumb camera-tricks and angles to underline mood and pass the time. Jackson and screenwriters Phillppa Boyens and Fran Walsh develop relationships that  never quite pay off, nor matter once Kong makes his appearance 90 minutes into the film.The ape, modeled after the movements of Andy ""Gollum"" Serkis,  is the star, the character with whom Ann, and the audience really falls in love. Made on a computer but as real as he can look - Aslan, in ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is shamed by comparison - Kong is an giant, aging silverback on an island in constant Darwinian struggle: The beast must have to fight for his life daily. The toll shows, and Ann, once she is delivered to Kong by the possessed natives, is a calm gem in the midst of chaos. The crucial and best change that Jackson inserts into his movie is that Ann, already established as a great girl with pride but diminished self-esteem, sees something worthwhile in Kong, too. Watts, with those perpetually red-rimmed eyes, small mouth and uncertain voice, was born to sell Ann's transformation, and so this touch really works - when Ann is thrown into an environment that truly threatens her life, Kong does what nobody else has. He saves her.And the creatures he saves her from! There is a battle in ""King Kong"" you have to see to believe and enjoy, between Kong and dinosaurs, fought on several terrains - including vines - that is endlessly inventive, furious and downright cool. It just goes on and on, viciously and on a tightrope, Kong performing a violent dance equal to Jackie Chan or Jet Li. How'd they do it? Who cares! Incredible!Meanwhile, the search party, including Denham and Driscoll, encounter their own monsters in a brontosaurus/raptor stampede. Later, in the scene that will make some in the audience crawl right out of their seats, they're trapped at the bottom of a canyon with giant insects, swamp slugs and crabs - another breathless sequence, and, frankly, I'd take my chances with the dinosaurs. Kong's capture, concocted by Denham, is epic and movie's saddest moment. ""We'll all be millionaires,"" he exclaims. After seeing such wonders, to be driven by dollars, Denham finally passes the rubicon of decency he's been walking beside the entire movie.The final set piece returns to New York, for the premiere of the beast and his eventual death atop the Empire State Building. The original ""King Kong"" had an advantage in that it doesn't have to bring emotional closure to Ann and Kong's relationship, whereas Jackson does; whereas the original shuts of the music and makes the final attack a merciless, unforgettable sound of biplanes and machine guns, Jackson jacks up the weeper meter. Is it a choice he's forced to make through his own skill of developing the earlier relationship? Maybe, but it denies him the raw, powerful ending that would have sent audiences out of theater with a jolt.Kong really is the star, but Watts makes a great damsel, distressed or not. She scolds Kong, even. She's tough, soulful, principled, a real cutie - Watts will make many a teen boy crush on her now, for the right movie and the right reasons. Brody is well cast because we aren't expecting Driscoll to be a hero, and Black reveals a previously unknown side, a kind of imprinted ruthlessness that show business breeds in a person. He crosses over here, like Jim Carrey has. The cast is rounded out by a motley, seasoned crew of actors, including Serkis as a dirty chef, Jamie Bell as the young shipmate, and Kyle Chandler as Ann's conceited co-star, Bruce Baxter.""King Kong"" will get serious awards consideration, and deservedly so - its sentimentality is built for awards, and its period nature is akin to ""Titanic."" It could do ""Titanic"" business, too, over the long run - its three-hour running time is only an obstacle once; after that, returning to the theater for it again is easy so long as you know that Cracker Jack prize lies in wait at Skull Island. The movie has enough heart for the ladies, every last special effect for the guys, and while flawed, it's never feeble. Jackson's movies really want it all, and the mere attempt is glorious; while Spielberg has graduated into statement films, the bushy fat guy's still with us eating our popcorn, noisy box candy and nachos on a cold night, in search of escape, adventure and meaning. Interesting that one character in reads ""Heart of Darkness."" King Kong"" reflects just the opposite."	4.0	Stuffed with incredible adventure (and just plain overstuffed, too)	2005-12-18	0	0	0

But if you don't want to know how the magic tricks are done ( to make the film) and to what degree the CGI and  WETA have  created the end product then do NOT get the two disc version.

With stunning visual effects and cinematography; I find this film a natural beauty.Skull island a place where the 'flop-film maker' and his crew travel to shoot a motion picture turns out to be a place of horror;Great cast includes:Andy Serkis who did KING KONG's bodily movement thru motion capture and also plays Lumpy the cook.Naomi Watts and Adrian Brody who do outstanding work, and Jack Black who plays the 'eccentric director' is very humorous as he is obsessed with shooting his film so that he will just about risk anything to get a good shot.Others (I'm not sure of the actors names) include the 'vain actor', Jimmy the kid that works on the ship (as seen in Billy Eliot), and the natives are just fantastic...It's a great movie with a great cast and screen play;I don't want to give any spoilers away for those who haven't seen the movie; however I must warn that it is a very LONG movie- but definitely worth your time.	5.0	8th wonder of the world!	2006-03-30	0	0	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2LR4NR0G8KO7C	"sarr ""sarr"""	This movie obviously tries to become a classical movie. The pictures and the acting performances are perfect and it is difficult to believe, that Kong isn't a real gorilla..but I think they shouldn't have given Peter Jackson such an enormous budget for this movie as he put in way too much computer material. Watching a supergorilla would have been enough already...Having dinosaurs from Jurassic Park and huge insects from Eight legged Freaks there at the same time simply is too much. Undoubtedly the movie is great to watch, but personally I believe the story of King Kong isn't interesting enough to make a blockbuster out of it. I only hope no one is thinking of a sequel.(SARR)	3.0	Jackson overdid it	2006-03-13	13	3	10
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1FBC4HMO54UWZ	Savvy	"Yesterday after a lot of coaxing and grueling by my better half and friends I finally decided to go watch the supposed box office buster this year... ""King Kong"". But my momentary weakness did not lessen my apprehensions about the movie whatsoever. I dragged myself out of what could have been a wonderful Friday evening lazing in front of my TV into what my friends referred to as an ""adventure of a lifetime"". ""Oh, the movie frenzy that can be brought about by a million dollar worth advertising campaign!"" I thought. Well, it isn't the first time gullible people like my friends and sometimes even I (sighs) have fallen for the excessive hype created about movies even before they were released. ""King Kong the official game of the movie!"" I giggled to myself (like the persistent ads on TV were not enough!).So anyway, moving on...we started off really early for the show because the apparent crowd drawn by the movie would make it impossible to find the right seats to make the movie watching experience EXTRA special, or so I was told! And boy what a loss it would be to view an already huge ""Kong"" in the angle that would not do justice to his size! Well, fortunately (for me) we did find the right seats...""Thank god! Or I wouldn't have heard the end of it!"" I said. Having arrived early (groans) gives you the wonderful opportunity to watch meaningless trivia and exciting hospital ads on a really big screen ""Man, what a treat!"" I thought. But it's a good tip for you late comers&#61514;. Also, it really helps you get a better perspective on to what lengths man is willing to go in order to conquer AND keep a good seat...even if that meant using every piece of your clothing to hold that seat! ""Sigh, such singular dedication towards a really `meaningful' cause"" I observed. Anyway, after an excruciatingly long wait and a bagful of popcorn, the movie finally commenced and silence fell upon the movie hall. ""At least, now in the darkness of the theatre, I could take a short and a much needed nap"" I thought. But, evidently that was not on the charts!The title sequence...was to my surprise intriguing enough to grab my attention from falling asleep. The director gradually unfolds the setting of the movie in this sequence, deliberately drawing you into the early 1930s and the basic lifestyle of that time period. By clever compilation of selected movie clips that summarize the environment, people's attitude, clothing style, architecture and so on the director gives you a brief insight of New York during the time of the Great Depression. It was amazing how in such a short time he was able to transfer many levels of information to the audience. Yes, he also introduces the protagonist (or in this case Kong's one true love) Naomi Watts during this sequence, efficiently disclosing her profession and also to some extent her financial crisis. The background music for the title sequence sets a tone to the movie and is very 1930s. ""Oh, guess it's not entirely a disaster after all"" I thought and I was right.In the movie, Naomi Watts is a struggling artist struck by poverty. She is depicted as a complex mixture of both vulnerability and courage. You find out that as a result of constant disappointments in the past she has developed a slightly pessimistic attitude towards life although she is shown to be brave enough not to stoop to prostitution driven by hunger. The director also carefully chose her attire and make-up style that give her a rather soft and tender look, I thought.By now, the audience loved this sweet girl who displayed great emotional strength in such hard times. Well, I liked her too, partly because I agree that most good things tend to die off. I guess that statement in the very beginning sets the flavor and spirit for this movie.The next scene that I found extremely interesting and impressionable was where the filmmaker (in the movie) Carl Denham, was introduced. Personally I think that his performance was by far the most excellent and unpredictable. As the movie continues he is revealed as an overly obsessive, stubborn, eccentric, sometimes even arrogant, highly selfish and foreboding personality. The story of King Kong is a direct result of this mans singular obsession with making a documentary on the hidden Island. So, although many of you who watched the movie and totally detested the man should realize that without him, there would be no story hence no `King Kong'As the movie prolonged, taking you to the part where the real adventure begins (the travel to Skull Island), in the spirit of not giving away too much to those of you who have not watched the movie as yet, I will just use one word.. HAUNTING! Although I think that the journey to the Skull Island was stretched a little bit more than necessary, I have to agree that it set a strong tone for what could be expected next i.e. a very unpleasant experience. Also the ship's crew portrays mediocre acting skills although fortunately for the director they could all depict fear quite well!! Moreover, the director's surreal cinematography in some instances of the movie adds to the mystery behind the Skull Island.Now, moving to my most dreaded and favorite part of the movie i.e. the tribal at Skull Island created by the twisted imagination of some screenplay writer (shivers) and the introduction of the second protagonist of the movie...King Kong.Ah King Kong, there is so much to talk about this fictional character who literally carries the burden of the second half of the movie all by himself. Although the director puts across Kong's existence as a freak of nature and a threat to human kind, his endearing personality makes it impossible to be afraid of him. It was strange to feel so attached and moved by a character that was not even real. ""Do I actually like this movie? I pondered, but why? I thought. I have seen movies with wonderful direction, performances and special effects before, how was this movie any more significant from the other good movies? I had no answer then. As I continued to watch I gradually began to immerse myself in the movie. I couldn't help but feel connected to this being that genuinely portrayed all human emotions from loneliness to complete hopelessness. Of course all of this was made possible by the use of cutting edge 3D computer technology and had no natural bearings whatsoever, but yet it was believable.That's when it occurred to me, it was not the special effects that made the creature real .I knew I was not particularly blown away by the computer animations either, which by the way were tardy in some of the scenes or the nerve wrecking `humans become dinosaur and bug food moments'. I was not dazzled by the acting either, since nobody was gratifying enough in that arena.So what was it that made my hands go numb by the end this movie? It was the STORY! The movie would have been a hit with me even if the fight sequences were less sexy or the dreamy eyed hero, Andy Serkis was replaced by the cynical Danny De Vito. For me, the story of one woman who was driven by destiny to reach an island far away just to meet the one thing she would ultimately end up losing forever was, as unfortunate as it may sound, a wonderful experience. The heart wrenching story made this giant fictional character seem `real' to me, hats off to the guy who wrote this fiction, which by far is a beautiful metaphor for life itself. King Kong is not just a creature with unbelievable physical strength but he is the epitome of what is becoming sadly scarce in our society today i.e. selfless love that does not understand nor follow the boundaries of human limitations. Watching him fall off that building in the final scene was unbelievable painful since to me it represented the death of humanity and hope in our hearts.Indeed, good things always come to an end(sighs)."	5.0	Fit for a KING!	2005-12-19	8	7	1

I usually wouldn't even bother to view flicks like that, but based on the reviews and previews/trailer this film looked interesting and it fully delivered on the promise. The CGI effects are well applied and it's just phantastic how they produced such an authentic motion picture. There are dinosaurs in there on Skull Island, monster spiders, giant cockroaches, and every other creature you can imagine from a pre-historic world or from a nightmare.Jack Black also delivers as an actor and does an excellent job. The moods are captured well and all the details seem to have been a lot of work and you can tell that craftsmen were at work here. This is a classic motion picture so to speak, or it will become one, and it's a cinematic experience so rare these days. Take the popcorn out and the nachos with cheese and you've got to see it on the big screen and also the DVD, whenever it will be released, will become part of the collection.	4.0	Very good!

Peter Jackson wanted to make this movie, for his whole life and it really shows. He has remained as true to the original story as possible, while still making it enjoyable to today's ""Smash Bomb"" audience, with more action but, important classic scenes intact. The acting is great, even though Jack Black is a weird choice to play Denham, he's believable enough. Altogether, I would say this is worth seeing, even for hardcore purists. Just to clarify this is a review of the 2-Disc Special Edition, which also has a free comic book inside!"	5.0	Worthy.	2011-07-01	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AF1ER4SZR6EZ0	Sci Fi Fan	"I fired up the DVD and sat down in a comfy chair with some popcorn, and made it almost an hour before I had to get up and turn it off.  I should have listened to the other negative reviewers - they were right!Although some have criticized the 1930's New York scenes and the boat scenes as slow and too long, I actually enjoyed this part of the movie.  Where it fell apart was when they reached the island.  Once they arrive, believability is thrown out the window, and I spent the rest of time saying to myself, ""That's not right"", ""They wouldn't act that way"", ""What happened to...."", and ""Why are they doing that?"".The captain alternately turns to port and starboard and starts and stops engines, while trying to maneuver through a rocky harbor.  When about to hit the rocks, he orders the engines to stop.  Huh?  Ships don't stop on a dime, and at least in the Titanic movie they got that right--if you want to stop a ship fast you have to throw it into reverse.  Yet the wise decision would have been to simply stop and wait out the fog in deeper water.The interaction with the natives was equally non-believable.  Peter Jackson should read the accounts of the first ships arriving on the South Sea islands.  His natives were a cross between ORCs, Caribbean Voodoo, and zombies.  What's the point?  And why do they simply disappear once they aren't needed?  Why are they hostile if they've never seen white men?  And why the special need to get the white woman for Kong?The wall looks more like Mordor than any real wall.  Let's see, the natives can build and maintain this wall but they play with LAVA around this WOODEN wall?  Where did that come from?  And what's the point of tying up the girl and putting her onto this elaborate rigging just to get her over the wall?  Just open the door and push her through.Once the intrepid rescuers go through the door, they are armed with machine guns.  These were the most feared weapons of their day.  Yet instead of using them, the rescuers usually turn and run.The dino chase through the gorge was ridiculous.  Let's see, I'll just start running down the Interstate Highway and see how long I can outrun 18 wheelers.  But I won't simply step to the side of the road and watch them go by, I'll try ducking between their legs?  And I loved it when the dinos stack up like police cars in a ""Blues Brothers"" movie.And how many gorges on on this island?  Especially ones with crumbling edges just as our heroes are near them?  Or perhaps they are full of vines that can support 6 tons of T-rex?But then, maybe the T-rex was on a diet, since he was trying to eat the heroine while swinging through the vines like a high-wire act.  Maybe he needed a snack before he resumes his fall?  How does he even know the she is food?And then Kong carries the iron heroine while running through the jungle in an ape-like fashion without crushing her?  And flips her around while battling three T-rexs at once?  I never understood why we needed dinos on Skull Island anyway.  In fact, I would have brought the dinos back to New York instead of Kong.Then we get the bugs and slugs, which add absolutely nothing to the movie.  It's like Jackson paying homage to Spielberg's gross-out attemtps in Temple of Doom.  Why does he need it in a Kong movie?  If he wanted to distract me from any attempt at telling a real story, he succeeded!I really can't comment on what happens after Kong reaches New York, because I didn't make it that far.  Jackson spends all this time trying to capture the flavor and feel of 1930's New York, and does well at it.  Then he throws it all away by going WAY overboard on the CGI island.  The look and feel of the real movies from the 1930s was the mystery of the island, the fog, the unknown natives, the strange sounds and drums, and the encounter with the giant ape.  It wasn't IN-YOUR-FACE CGI.And it is this stunt-ride through CGI dangers that ultimately fails to let you absorb any sense of mystery, and leaves you unable to be pulled into the relationship between Kong and the heroine.  So despite some potentially great movie moments, such as when she does here vaudeville act and makes Kong laugh, Jackson misses the boat.And after the success of LOTR, you have to wonder if anyone close to Jackson has enough nerve to say to him - ""But Peter, it really doesn't work if you do it that way"".  I'm not optimistic he can do another good movie if he's surrounded by YES Men and Women.Like many disappointing high budget visual wonders, what finally kills KONG is not the airplanes, but the failure to tell a story."	1.0	Had to turn it off	2006-04-07	42	23	19

I found my self crying and applauding at the end. The actors all do very well and the graphics are great. the music is also something to look forward to. i was disappointed that the soundtrack did NOT have all of the songs on it! I do not know if there will be an extended coming out, but if it does it will  be December 31. one scene in the movie, the insect scene was said to be cut out in the old version because it made test audiences vomit. just think of what would happen if they saw this one! In the theater i remember watching many people race out of the theater and hide in the bathroom for that scene. I do not find it that bad and most movie fans will not. but if you hate bugs, skip the scene. one thing that i do love about the movie is that Kong has a heart. And anne does too. in the old one, all you saw was a large monster and a screaming girl. not in this one. the Central Park scene, for some reason made me cry. yep. mainly because people like me get attached to movie characters and are sad to see them go. I DO know that there are some scenes cut. they will probally make an extended to put them in, because i see that on the special features there ARE no deleted scenes. the Piranadohn and some other movie making scenes are NOT there.  this version is cheaper so if you dont really care about that then ok.  Andy Serkis is a GREAT character in it. he plays Kong and the cook Lumpy, who regrettably has a bad death, both i mean not just Lumpy. so i would say, if you are debating what to buy, get this! it is the best and i am sad that there are only 5 stars because it needs a 10. music and all. the music is the best part though. but, Carl's eyebrows are pretty cool too. lol.	5.0	Jackson stikes again!	2006-02-25	7	4	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2QAUMR0V33GC9	"Scot Carr ""Film and book phanatic"""	"After his great success with (and some might say, overexploitation of) ""The Lord Of The Rings,"" Peter Jackson turned his attention to yet another desired project - ""King Kong.""  It's obvious how much he loved it (one merely has to review some of the bonus material in the original's DVD rerelease to see that), and the source material HAS been improved in some cases, but one can see with both the theatrical cut and this ""extended"" edition, much bloat has been added, a la Lucas, in order to ""make a classic even better.""  Sometimes, though, improved scenery and realism in the effects, and adding more material, just plain gets in the way of what is, was, and always will remain, a simple story that succeeds BECAUSE it's simple.For the most part, Jackson's ""King Kong"" is refreshing.  I love the original because it tried to tell an adventure story that mingles reality with fantasy.  Back in the day, this was a hard thing to do because it actually meant having to physically MAKE the effects happen.  Here, Jackson plays to his strengths because he, and the geniuses at WETA, show the exact same effort with a modern method - one can see how they slaved over the digital shots to make them fit into reality.  He did the same thing, to phenominal effect, in ""Lord of the Rings.""  He and the writers also know that today's audiences don't need for the script to be simplistic in order to keep us entertained.  If the story is well-told, we're willing to sit through character development and genuine emotion-building moments.  In showing us a sweet, platonic, and doomed connection between human woman and giant male ape, Jackson gives us a payoff the original only hinted at.Yet when we see this over three-hour enterprise, I get the feeling that less truly would've been more.  The original clocked in at just over an hour.  The theatrical release came in at under three.  Even that felt a little heavy.  I can't really put my finger on what would've been better to cut (although I think we could've done less with the wonders of Skull Island), but I think we could've spent less time watching it as a whole and still gotten one Hell of a ride from this retelling.All and all though, the Extended Cut IS interesting.  The wonders of digital film media is that, once you watch the whole movie, YOU can decide what to watch and not watch, thus shorten the film experience the way YOU want to.  It makes the whole thing worthwhile in the end.  And I'll be honest - I'd rather see the complete vision of the storytellers the first time around anyway."	4.0	Beautiful, Unusual - And Yet Too Big For Its Own Good	2006-11-25	8	6	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AEIY7PVJFEKVV	Scott K. Sokol	First and foremost, the original 1933 version of King Kong stillstands as the quintessential monster movie. The special effectsare still unsurpassed, realistic and wrenching. The cast is perfect, especially Fay Wray who by herself invented the movie scream. the fact that the original is seen in glorious black and white adds to the films moodiness and mystery. In short, it is an unequaled work of art that required no further rendition.Now to the recent remake. I titled this review No Progress because as soon as I saw the action on Skull Island I realized that the CGI looked cartoonish, unrealistic, phony and remarkedthat 73 years later, film making took a giant step backward.This remake, like many others is a classic example of subtraction by addition.

In the theater, the CGI was completely believable.  It looked real.On the HD Blu-Ray this is not the case.  At times it's like watching the old movies when the characters drive and it's obvious the cars moving behind them are on a screen.  The dramatic effect is severely lessened by the fact that the actors and the creatures appear to be on two separate planes and the creatures look clearly ""drawn.""I am not sure if the standard definition DVD would eliminate this problem and recreate the experience that audiences had in the theater.  I haven't seen it.  I'd be curious if someone else has seen it and could comment.I can't recommend this movie enough but I am hesitant to recommend the HD Blu-Ray.

""King Kong"" is a perfect choice for Jackson and his talented crew of actors and behind-the-scenes magicians, particularly his special effects wizards at the Weta Workshop.""King Kong"" presents Jackson with the exact opposite problem that he took on in ""The Lord of the Rings"" - namely, the amount of story.  With ""The Lord of the Rings,"" Jackson and his team had to take a mammoth, unfilmable narrative (in its novel form) and tease three films from it.  To say they succeeded is an understatement.""King Kong,"" on the other hand, has barely ninety minutes of ""story.""  So how does Jackson get a three-hour movie out of it?  By recreating a stylized yet realistic New York City circa 1933 and creating from scratch the vicious cauldron of monsters called ""Skull Island,"" home of Kong.  There is not one shot in this movie that is less than dazzling, whether it's a close-up of Naomi Watts' eyes or the spectacle of Kong tossing aside cars and trains or battling dinosaurs.Jackson has made a violent movie, so you should be wary before bringing the little kiddies.  As one gruesome example, Andy Serkis (as the crewman Lumpy) gets eaten by monstrous slugs . . . head-first.  This is shoddy treatment of Serkis by Jackson, as Serkis, who played Gollum/Smeagol in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" also ""plays"" Kong and must have spent hundreds of hours hopping around in a motion-capture suit.I won't bother recapping the story, which you have to know.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1DLWJTG7SXDEQ	S. D.	"I thought I'd write my review of this movie by comparing the classic 1933 version to the new Peter Jackson 2005 version.First off, if you haven't seen both KONGS, you will find spoilers in my write-up that follows. In that case, you may just want to skip reading this.Otherwise, here are my thoughts:New York City of the '30s: Both movies handled it great. The original, obviously, because it WAS the 1930's when the movie was made. But the 2005 version did a great job covering the look and feel of that era in the Big Apple. ADVANTAGE: TIEJack Black vs Robert Armstrong as Carl Denim: Watching Black was about like watching someone scrape their fingernails on a blackboard. The guy can't act. Period. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONGThe natives of Skull Island: I have to admit, the natives in the 2005 version were much scarier. But before I give the nod to the 2005 Kong version here, I have to go on to a few more ""native"" items, the first being the capture of Ann from the ship. In the original the natives quietly come up in small boats alongside the ship and kidnap her. In the 2005 version, the natives are Olympic Champions as they pole-vault all the way from the island to the ship and SOMEhow get her back to the island with them (pole-vaulting back?) CALL THE OLYMPICS!  The second item I didn't like about the 2005 natives was that they just disappeared from the Island after the start of the movie. Where were they when Kong came pounding on the huge door? Because of these items, I say: ADVANTAGE 1933 KONGFay vs. Naomi and the way they covered their role as Ann Darrow. I have one question. Since when did this movie turn into a true LOVE story? Kong is a huge beast. Kong kills anyone and anything in his path that prevents him from getting what he wants (in this case, Ann). So what would the correct response be for someone in danger? To SCREAM! And that's exactly what Fay did in the 1933 original. While Naomi tumbled, juggled, and went ice skating with him instead. This brought back images from the terrible 1976 remake. And what's with Naomi being the ONLY person running around a snow covered New York City at the end of the movie, without wearing a coat of any kind? Not only that, but actually WANTING to climb to the very top of the Empire State Building crown to be closer to the giant ape. Can you imagine how cold and windy it would be at THAT altitude? Not to mention how icy/slippery the stairs would have been up there as well. Fay wanted to stay clear of Kong. Naomi (coatless) wants to hug his leg to protect him! ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONGThe look of KONG: For what they had available in 1933, Kong looked pretty darn good. There was a lot of work put into his animation and the other creatures as well. But I WILL concede that he looked far more realistic in the 2005 version. ADVANTAGE: 2005 KONGKONG vs the TYRO: The original had a great battle complete with wonderful sound effects as the Tyro whipped his tail about. Even knocking Kong into a tree that topples which was holding Ann. But the new version has MULTIPLE TYROS for KONG to fight. And what a fight it is. Very well done. Except for the fact that Kong held Ann in his hand for the entire fight and she would have suffered some of the nastiest whiplash this side of a head-on train collision!  The new 2005 version even has KONG doing the infamous cracking of the TYRO's jaw scene. But there's one thing the original has that the 2005 version doesn't. AFTER the fight there is a scene where Driscoll has to jump in and out of the mouth of the TYRO in order to continue following KONG. In that scene you can see the blood streaming from the jaw of the TYRO. This scene isn't shown in the 2005 version. So, in this category I'd say: ADVANTAGE: TIESpeaking of missing items from the 2005 version, how about the brontosaurous chomping on some of the crew members? How about Kong vs the Snake in the cave? And Kong chewing on some of the natives? And Kong STOMPING the natives into the mud? And Kong chomping on people in New York City when he escapes? And tossing the woman to her death that he pulls from an apartment high up in one building? And of course, what about the VERY famous subway train scene where Kong smashes the track and the conductor only sees Kongs head and the whites of his eyes coming up through the tracks ahead?  Every one of these are scenes that helped make the original as famous as it is. So which is better? Including them? Or not? This is an easy one. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONGWhen Kong came crashing through the huge gate on Skull Island, the original had much more tension to the scene. The bolt across the door slowly bent and cracked. The crew AND the natives all piled on together in an effort to stop the rampaging gorilla! The 2005 version had Kong just quickly batter through the door. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG.MUSIC - There's just no comparison here. The 1933 KONG has one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. The music worked WITH the action on the screen. The 2005 soundtrack is forgetable. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONGTHE INFAMOUS SPIDER/INSECT SCENE - Pulled from the original movie because it was thought to distract viewers from thinking about KONG, the 2005 version DID include it. Granted, the insects were hideous. It was a scary scene. But since when does someone that doesn't know how to shoot a gun shoot directly AT someone covered with insects and ONLY shoot the insects off of him without one shot hitting the crewman? Because of this stupidity it would have been better to HAVE eliminated this scene. And again: ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG.I could go on for a lot longer, but just counting up the ADVANTAGES that I've already shown above, you can see that I don't consider the 2005 KONG version to even come CLOSE to the original 1933 version.In a way, I'm surprised though. Mainly because Peter Jackson said he loved the original. I thought he would pay better homage to it. Not so."	3.0	KONG 1933 vs. KONG 2005	2006-03-08	18	8	10

What the heck were the new cast and crew thinking when they made this piece of ????. Come on, King Kong sliding/skating around on an ice pond holding Ann in his hand!?  Denham acting like a buffoon the entire show! Driscoll looking like he should have been a scout troop leader (Girl's). And Ann, well she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, much less scream like Fay Wray did in the original.  What a letdown.  With all the money and technology available today this could have been a blockbuster. Sad, Sad, Sad.	1.0	What A Joke! And not even a funny one!	2006-04-03	20	7	13

The CG looks good by itself, but when live and CG is mixed, looks HORRIBLE!!!  Jurassic Park one looked A LOT better.  The fight scene with the T Rex and Kong was just too unbelieveable.  T Rex fully biting into Kong and no damage whatsoever?!?!?!  Come on.  Sure am glad I just rented it.  I totally agree with all the other one star reviews.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3DC53MM1NGLBB	Sean	"When this movie was first anounced I didn't give a damn, It meant nothing to me, it was just another remake. I never saw the original and never really wanted to. Then the trailers for this came out. I still wasn't impressed. The CGI looked pretty bad and it just didn't look that exciting or good. Then a couple of days before its release I watched some clips over at Yahoo! Movies. After those clips I was officially excited for this movie. Then came the big problem, I didn't think I'd get to see it because of the busy holiday season coming up.Well, last night I got to see King Kong and all I have to say it WOW! This was one hell of a movie. The CGI is utterly amazing, easily the best in film history. If you told me that they used a real 25-foot-tall ape for this I'd say ""Where'd you get it?"" If you told me that they actually filmed at Skull Island I'd say ""Book me a ticket"", it was that damn believeable. Oh and the natives looked real too. 1933 New York City looks awesome too, you actually believed in it. Kong looks absolutely stunning though andi s the main star. The amount of detail on him is staggering and Andy Serkis did an amazing job with him, his facial expressions are just amazing, major kudos to WETA. The story was amazing as well. I mean, a love story between a woman and an ape is farfetched, but Jackson made it work, actually he made is work very very well. I actually felt for both Ann and Kong. Kong felt real and I cared about him and his feelings, I won't put this in spoiler tags because everyone already knows how the movie ends, when he fell of the Empire State Building I was sad, he was gone but he hadn't done anything wrong. He died for loving someone which is unfair. Naomi Watts did a great job as Ann, damn does that woman have a pair of lungs!Peter Jackson loves the original Kong and it shows through here. You can tell that he is making a remake of the movie he really loves and frankly, I'm very happy. The whole time I was on the edge of my seat and man did this movie tire me out, it had me laughing, on the edge of my seat, sad. It messed with my emotions but in the best way possible. As I said, this movie tired me out, I got hom and went to bed and didn't wake up till about 10:00 this morning. But when I did wake up you know what was the first thing on my mind, that's right, breakfast! Just kidding, it was Kong of course.Bottom line, you NEED to see this movie. It's the best movie of 2005 easily and is a movie that needs to be experienced in the theater with an audience."	4.0	It Was Beauty Killed The Beast...	2006-04-17	5	3	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A13UAIE3K517CQ	sft	Peter Jackson's labour of love is a spectacular, if overlong, remake of the movie that filled him with wonder as a small boy and inspired him to become a film maker. He may play fast and loose with the viewer's ability to suspend disbelief, giving us, as he does, indestructible people who are impossibly lucky when avoiding being trampled and can strafe their entire surroundings with machine-gun fire and only hit the monsters, but this is OK because it's part of the film's glorious sense of fun. And there may be plenty of ripe dialogue and facial contortion but Jackson puts so much heart into his production that this is perfectly in keeping with the tone of the work. Jackson has made a thrilling homage to the original Hollywood blockbuster, while successfully maintaining the emotional core of the plot. Self-indulgent it may be but it's all the better for that.	4.0	Skull Island -- the tropical destination that's big on wildlife!	2008-12-22	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A19HFZF2KCUFLP	Shadow	Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' is to me the best installment by far.From casting to capturing the feel of the 1930s; the directing is splendid. I'm a fan of Jack Black and was a little sceptical at first about how he would pull off his role until I saw him in action. Adrien Brody also held his own, but more impressive to me was Naomi Watts.The relationship between her and Kong was one that U could 'really' feel, especially in the scenes where he protected her against the wild prehistoric creatures.I think anyone who may not have seen this movie yet will be impressed with the look of the sunset and skyline scenes as well as the dark and frightening feel of Skull Island and the primitive people who lurk there.Also notable is the special effects of which my 'favorite' is the creation of the gigantic insects that the crew had to fight off.Spectacular!Say what U will about Peter Jackson's previous work but I think he deserves an A+ for bringing Kong to life once again.	5.0	Awesome	2007-02-01	1	1	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A18IK6YI6T3RK2	Shannon Deason	This is an amazing piece of work, the special effects are simply spectacular and the digital King Kong has to be seen to believe, I mean his fur even rustles the wind.  The battles on the island between Kong and the TRex's is as visually brillant as anything I have ever seen of film, but alas this film is hella long.  Does Peter Jackson know what a film editor is, the first half of the film, though well done, drags and Watts and the unique looking Brody, have no chemistry and that hurts.  Black was an odd choice, but he works here, sort of.  When I was young my Dad took me to see the 70's Kong, uh hardly the 30's classic, but I remember how beautiful Jessica Lange was and what great chemistry she had with Kong, it was  touching and strangely erotic, but this film loses all of that, Watts and Kong have a totally platonic relationship, I guess this is a P.C. Kong...too bad, because it makes the ending, though sad, not as heartbreaking as watching Lange scream from the depths of her soul when he dies, it was Langes breakout role and she really made you feel that she had fallen in love with Kong, a real beauty and the beast, this film lacks that element and I think it hurts the overall power of Kongs death.  I do totally recommend this DVD, it's a visually spectacular film, that needed a Jessica Lange, and an editor...too bad it posseses neither.	4.0	LONG KONG	2006-02-28	12	4	8
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1FCWRSICTO2AH	S. Harris	Well, I guess this is what happens when you have three big wins (Lord of the Rings) in your corner.  You are given a free pass from the studio to go wild. And Jackson did.  There are so many side-stories and silly stories in the new Kong that you have to pinch yourself and remember there was a great original one way back in 1933.  And that movie had the good sense to know it was a B movie, and that 90 minutes is what you should clock in at. But I guess Jackson won't do anything less than 3 hours these days, no matter how over stuffed the end product becomes. Still, there are some wonderful scenes in this movie. Jackson is a master with CGI (which is why I'm giving this 2 stars), and the monkey is incredible, as are the bugs and other monsters. (But even that talent will have you wondering if some of the shots are outtakes from the Rings movies. The famous Skull Island wall looks like some sort of nuked rejection from Mordor.)Excepting Black, the cast is fine.  But as in any movie, a cast is only as good as its script.  And Jackson's attempt to inject importance is laughable.  Having characters discussing Conrad's Heart of Darkness does not ratchet things up a bit. It just looks pretentious. And I actually felt bad for Watts (a fine actress) at the end, with her making lovey dove eyes at Kong as they skated across the ice. It was like Jackson went out for a smoke and Ron Howard stepped in to film that incredibly bad and syrupy scene. In fact, the  whole relationship between the monkey and Watts was so overplayed (in the original Fay Wray never stopped screaming, she never chased after Kong, as Watts does, in any way) that it undercut the movie's final line: It was beauty that killed the beast.  No, it was the director.	2.0	Bloated beyond belief	2006-10-15	19	8	11
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3LTVR7PCFPBXO	Shepard	Please people, stop going to see remakes.  If we stop going, they will stop making them.  Jackson's Kong was worse than the 70's remake of Kong.  Much worse.  I agree 100% with Floyd the Barber's review.  The only thing I will add is that the scene in NYC when Kong finds Anne in the backlite street is a contender for top 2 worst movie moments in history.  The audience I saw this with laughed out loud at this moment.  I had serious high hopes for this film.  I went to the midnight opening for pete's sake.  But just like the new Star Wars films these hack filmmakers have let the public down.  Most people in this country don't have health care.  But they waste millions of dollars on crap films like this.  So my call to action is to not give them any more of our hard earned money.  Ban all remakes.  Tell Hollywood to get new ideas or get out!  Thank you, that is all.	1.0	Worse remake than Planet of the Apes, Godzilla, or Oh.. Just any of them	2006-01-03	21	6	15

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2L9RSH5C5QSCX	S. H. Towsley	This is a grand entertainment which represents the finest tribute to the original 1933 film KING KONG ever attempted by a long way.  It is a great ride on its own merits and a fine work of mainstream movie magic.It is hard to overstate the loving care apparent in the execution of this reimagining of the classic story, from individual effects shots to the performances of a quality cast anchored, perhaps surprisingly -- NOT by Jack Black who is arguably and finally without doubt miscast -- but by the mesmerizing, lovely, sexy, sweet, sincere and wholely seductive Naomi Watts.I do wholeheartedly recommend Peter Jackson's unreservedly ambitious, all-stops-out version of KING KONG, even though it entirely fails, with the exception of a moment or two with Miss Watts, to touch that part of my heart reserved for my lifelong love, the incomparable and virtually mystical movie production, the 1932-33 KING KONG.	4.0	A wonderful KONG which still can't touch the original	2006-12-06	3	2	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A6UGTB17P5BX8	Simon Gifford	"The plot of this lavish 2005 remake follows that of the 1933 film very closely - this is the story of a young and beautiful actress named Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) from the world of vaudeville who finds herself lost in depression-era New York and her luck changes when she meets an over-ambitious filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black) who brings her on an exploratory expedition to a remote island where she finds compassion and the true meaning of humanity with an ape known only as Kong. The beauty and the beast finally meet their fate back in the city of New York where the filmmaker takes and displays the ape in quest of his fame by commercial exploitation which ultimately leads to catastrophe for everyone including a playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) who falls in love with Ann and plays an unlikely hero by trying to save her from Kong and her destiny.Despite its 3 hour runtime and the fact the set up may be too long, I was enthralled by this film and never bored once. It delivers some truly stunning set pieces, including the attack by the hostile, murderous natives of Skull Island, continuing with a dinosaur rampage and a terrifying tribute to the lost Spider Pit scene from the 1933 original. I also loved the period detail of the film, like the reconstruction of 1930's New York.When Kong does appear, it is a true wonder to behold. Not only is the effect totally convincing (trust me, you will think its' real) but Andy Serkis does a marvellous job of portraying what is, perhaps ironically, the most human character in the film.His Kong is a a tortured soul, like the Beast in Beauty and The Beast, or Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies - and shows us that even the most ""beastly"" characters can have gentle qualities.Naomi Watts is also quite brilliant considering most of the time she is acting with something that isn't really there. To watch the friendship develop between human and ape is really very touching.I also liked the in-jokes and humor in the film brought about by Jack Black - there are some lovely asides to the original 1933 King Kong.Truly a fantastic film, one that deserves to be seen. Peter Jackson - you are truly a master."	5.0	Peter Jackson the Master	2006-02-11	10	9	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1VR1W21LV4ZME	"sir robin ""john"""	"Going into King Kong, I had my doubts.  I was really looking forward to it, and I had high expectations that I was afraid wouldn't be met.  Well, they were met and, in a sense, surpased.  King Kong is a fantastic film.  Everything kong fans would want, and everything Peter Jackson fans would want.The only downside is the beggining.  It is way too long before kong shows up.  In fact, it's about an hour.  However, this does provide the watcher with great characters and great suspenseful anticipation.  So once the mighty gorrila does appear, it's all the cooler.And once he does show up, the action never stops.  The movie has a relentless pace.  ACtion scene after action scene action scene.  The great thing about Peter Jackson is his willingness to go all out when it comes to action with special effects.  He doesn't hold back for integrity or suspense like Speilburg, he creates these insanely amazing sequences that blow me away.  Not only is he willingly to do this, but he he very competent at it.  He's very creative when it comes to big action pieces.  The best one in this film is Kong vs. multiple T-rexes.  It's really amazing.I've heard many people complain about the ""stampede"" scene, that it doesn't look real.  Well, I thought it looked great.  It's a really awesome scene.Right after Kong is captured on Skull Island, we cut right to New York.  This is a good thing.  Lets not waste any more time on the ship.  Kong's rampage through New York is as cool as any one could ask.  He throws cars around and smashes stuff.  It's just awesome.  There is a somewhat corny scene with Ann on a frozen pond, but it still serves it's purpose well.The famous climax atop the Empire State Building is a bit drawn out, but it's so visually spectacular that we can forgive it.The brilliance of Kong, is it's epic nature.  The action is relentless and huge.  The characters are all developed beyond what they should be.  Sure, Jackson is gluttunous in his film making, but that is just so friggin fun to watch.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A13IKSGDYNBNQS	S J Buck	I've just watched the first two hours of this and in another session will get to the end no doubt. This movie is simply too long, there is no justification for a potboiler like this being three hours long.The beginning was pretty poor, Jack Black overacts in the opening section of the film and only Naomi Watts performance kept me watching (less is more Jack). The appearance of the natives on the island changed everything, suddenly this was much more interesting, and eventually after a lot of time had passed Kong appeared.Kong is hugely impressive, this is a spectacular CGI creation and credit to all involved for this aspect of the film. However at this point the dinosaurs appeared and I'm afraid things started going wrong again. Our wonderful heroine (who has kept me watching) is now in serious trouble. She doesn't really trust Kong but the place is full of dinosaurs. But it doesn't matter she escapes, narrowly avoids being eaten by medium size dinosaur, outruns a T-Rex, avoids another T-Rex, is recaptured by Kong, who then fights three T-Rex's whilst carrying our heroine. They all fall into large ravine being saved by vines where the fight continues.... at this point I had to take a break.I know, this is a fantasy, and no doubt kids will love it, but come on some small attempt at realism would add so much to the film. So far the best thing in the film is the CGI Kong - and thats great because if Kong is rubbish then you are in serious trouble. So my ratings so far are:Kong - 5 StarsNaomi Watts - 4 StarsJack Black - 2 StarsScript - 2 starsDirection - 3 starsSee you at the end eventually.	3.0	Way too long	2007-04-13	5	2	3

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	You've all seen the original 1933 version of King Kong, right? It was awesome. It was shockingly good for its day.To the preservationists who say that one should only re-make bad movies...not good ones...think this: One should re-make old good movies and make them as good or better. That's what this film accomplishes.King Kong 2005 (preserved circa 1933 in living color with today's style FX) retains the original's storyline to the tee, but gives this classic a beautiful 21st century treatment.It's 3 hours long. The first hour is a bit (unnecessarily) character development heavy. But the action filled subsequent 2 hours makes this version of the classic well worth the price of purchase. The 2005 version of King Kong is as true to the original story as a preservationist could possibly ask, and it keeps the viewer captivated as if seeing the true 8th Wonder of the World for the first time ever.If you're thinking that this could be another attempt similar to the atrocious 1976 debacle re-make of King Kong think again. All of the impressionable scenes and impressionable lines from the 1933 story are preserved. And some great scenes are added that movie magic could not have possibly imagined back when the original was shot.So for a re-make, this is tops. From a director that knows how to weave a terrific story.Action fans, don't pass on this. Monster movie fans, don't pass on this. Preservationists, don't pass on this.King Kong 2005 is as classic as its 1933 original.	4.0	RemaKing Kong	2006-04-01	0	0	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ACVQ6OMN2T773	S. Mayo	"At 3 hours plus, you go in wondering just what it is that is going to take up that much time. In the end, it's Naomi Watts's face. It's a pretty face, but there are entire scenes dedicated to her making soulful eyes at Kong, and getting the same in return. It's overdone to the point of near creepiness. They hammered at it until you start to wonder if the heroine has, well, certain issues.There are high points. The ""traffic pileup"" of dinosaurs has to be seen to be believed, and the scene with Kong on ice managed to be genuinely touching and funny. Somewhere in here was a great one and a half hour movie. It just got lost under a vast, idealized, slightly creepy woman/ape relationship.One warning for adults - the movie is clearly being pitched to kids, and uncritical kids at that. Crank suspension of disbelief to the maximum setting. An example: when they capture Kong, you are naturally wondering how they are going to manage to get Kong on a ship, and then have the ship survive with an angry Kong inside it for days of voyage. You're anticipating dramatic scenes. Forget it: the movie answers this by just skipping the whole question; the next scene is in New York. In the frantic rush to make Social Commentary (and/or get to the next soulful expression), some wonderful opportunities for genuine storytelling got brushed aside.If you have kids who like their monsters big and strong, and occasionally repulsive; or someone who gets teary-eyed over what happens to monkeys in China (they get eaten), you might get something out of this. I was just looking for action and adventure, and it had some, but it got, well, Jackson'd to death. The man needs someone to tell him to lay off the melodrama and get to the point."	2.0	Beating points to death	2009-08-07	18	6	12
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1R2ONSLAI3M2X	"S.M. ""horror buff"""	I don't quite understand all the 5 star ratings for this movie when compared to the 1976 remake of King Kong. In my opinion, that remake was much better than this one was. I saw this new King Kong at the theater and couldn't wait to see it for I'm a huge Kong fan. I will say that Naomi Watts gave a good performance but I was not impressed by Jack Black's performance as a filmmaker in this movie. The over 3 hour long movie does past by fast but I found the first half rather boring! It seems like they will never arrive at Skull Island. I will say that their rendention of Skull Island was beautiful. The whole movie had beautiful scenery and great special effects. However, I could have done without all the dinosaurs in this movie. It almost made me feel like I was watching Jurassic Park! and all the huge bugs..... kindy silly even though the point of these huge bugs was to show us that everything on Skull Island grew to great proportions..... including the 8th wonder of the world..... Kong! Although good, it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I found there was too much animation in this movie unlike the 1976 version which didn't contain an animated Kong, making Kong look much more real. Congrats to Peter Jackson for his success in making this movie. Even though not extremely impressed with this remake, I will buy it when it is released on DVD on March 28th, just to add to my Kong collection.	3.0	Not The Best Remake.....	2006-03-05	13	3	10

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L	Solid Snake	Given the fact that practically everyone knows the big ape dies after falling from the empire state building (it's on the DVD cover for crying out loud) one wonders why Hollywood decided to remake King Kong.The answer is Peter 'Lord of Ticket Sales' Jackson, and his enviable grasp of story telling and spectacular FX. Unlike Michael Bay, who is content with blowing up multi-million dollar sets and selling it as cinema, Jackson actually drops a few nuggets of character development and plot into the mix.The result is a spectacular action film with enough heart and brains to keep you engaged even when Kong isn't smashing T-Rex heads together. If action and story don't do it for you then you'll still have the pleasure of seeing Naomi Watts run around in the jungle for 45 minutes wearing nothing but a silk nighty.Speaking of Naomi, she's the only one here who really has to act. Everyone else gets outdone by the monkey, including oscar winner Adrien Brody. It's not his fault though, he just doesn't get much screen time.A truly action packed film that makes the most of the limited material gleaned from the original. At almost three hours it can start to drag near the end, but that's what the remote is for. DVD includes no extras - but a two disc special edition is available for the fans of featurettes.	4.0	A Chest Thumping, Rope Swinging Good Time	2008-10-27	0	0	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2VUWZUJGZPMQ2	"SpeekNDaTruuf ""Wizdumb"""	Category: MoviesGenre: Action & AdventureMovie Title: King KongMovie Release: 2005Director: Peter JacksonScreenplay: Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Peter JacksonStory: Merian C. Cooper, Edgar WallaceOn DVD?: YesRating: 3 1/2 starsSummation: In 1933, King Kong made its debut. In 1976, John Guillerman remade King Kong, starring Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange, and the story only slightly differed. In 2005, Peter Jackson remade King Kong, starring Jack Black, Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody, but the story remained most like the 1933 version. A film crew embarked on a journey to an unknown island, only to find giant dinosaurs (in the 2005 remake), giant insects (in the 2005 remake), and the infamous Kong (1933, 1976 and 2005 versions).Synopsis: To retell the story of King Kong would prove quite pointless as most Americans have either seen the original or the remake, and neither differ much from the other.Personal Thoughts: The 2005 version happens to be my favorite, and I'll tell you why. First, seeing as technological capabilities have improved, the graphics are much better than those in the 1933 and 1976 versions. In the 2005 version, Kong actually looks authentic, as if a giant ape could exist. In the previous two versions, Kong appeared stilted, somewhat unreal. The movements of the giant gorilla weren't as fluid as in the 2005 version.But, technological capabilities aside, I also think that the 2005 version had a better range of characters. That's not to say that Jack Black or Adrien Brody are better actors than Jeff Bridges or Charles Grodin (and don't even ask me to name the characters in the 1933 version without me searching IMDB.com) or that Naomi Watts is a better actress than Jessica Lange, but I'm more familiar with the characters in this 2005 version than I am with the characters in the two previous versions. Jack Black is a known comic, starring in Saving Silverman, Shallow Hal and School Of Rock to name a few (and besides, I'm a Jack Black fan *lol*). Naomi Watts is known for her roles in Mulholland Dr., The Ring and The Ring Two. Also, it seemed as if the additional characters (i.e., Thomas Kretschmann who played Captain Englehorn, Colin Hanks who played Preston, and sexy Evan Parke who played Hayes, etc.) had a bigger role than the supporting cast of the two previous films.Not only are the technological capabilities farther advanced and the actors more suited, but the location (because of the technological capabilities) appears more authentic as well. Maybe the film crew didn't go to an unknown island, but it sure appeared that way. The lush greenery, the rotted, decaying logs, the oasis of an undiscovered continent... all of those add to the scenery to make it look more realistic than the two previous versions.By far, the 2005 version, to me, is the best yet. Hence, 3 1/2 stars.	3.0	King Kong, A Review by SpeekNDaTruuf	2008-01-24	1	0	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A9B7PMQP9ZETJ	spongeworthy	"When Peter Jackson announced that Jack Black would play the lead in King Kong I was absolutely mystified. Supposedly a funnyman, Black's schtick consists of raising his eyebrows and talking in an overly sarcastic manner. There's no material, just him being a jerk.He can't act. Period. For most of the movie he's an anachronism, 21st century Jack Black playing himself in a movie set during the Depression. When the ship's captain compares him to a cockroach Black's response sounds like a line from an SNL sketch, not from a character in a period movie.His performance, for lack of a better word, distracts from what is one of the most astounding visual achievements in cinematic history. The computer generated Kong is totally realistic. The ""love story"" between Kong and Ann Darrow is sweet and believable. Naomi Watts is luminous and heartbreaking, quite a feat considering most of her performance was done in front of a bluescreen with no giant ape anywhere nearby.The brontosaurus scene is astonishing for its sheer audacity. The idea of having them stampede and pile up is just plain crazy, but they pulled it off.The T-rex scene is one of the great action sequences in history. Again, what audacity -- not one but three!The movie is a bit long, but that's a minor quibble. This film would be an unqualified masterpiece were it not for the woefully miscast Black."	3.0	Ruined by Jack Black	2006-05-04	7	1	6
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3DY46ZABF4CMQ	"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer"""	Academy Award winning director Peter Jackson (the Lord Of The Rings trilogy) joins Academy Award winning actor Adrian Brody, Academy Award nominee Naomi Watts, and comedian Jack Black in the heart winning remake of the classic tale of King Kong.The movie pursues an eccentric 1930's film maker, Black, who takes off on an ocean voyage after getting scolded by his producers following a bad test screening to find the mysterious Skull Island where it was said is home to a monstrous creature. All that the director wants is to capture scenes from this island to put in his next movie to make millions. Accompanying him is an aspiring actress named Ann, played brilliantly by Watts, his writer, played by Brody, and the rest of the movie and ship crew.Cutting to the chase, King Kong, an enormous ape, is discovered on the Island occupied by grizzly natives who sacrifice Ann to him. What occurs between Ann and the ape is a heartwarming relationship. Ann discovers that the monstrous animal is not that monstrous, but playful, courageous and loyal. The scenes where Kong rescues Ann from the raging dinosaurs, including a few T-rexes, are reminiscent to Jurassic Park, but amazing action sequences that end with quite a laugh.The story evolves into a striking love story, not a romance, between the ape and Ann that end up in an incredibly rebuilt 1930's New York City, where Kong causes awe and havoc in the city, but all for the search of his lovely Ann where he sees a beauty that kills the beast within him.It's a lovely tale, and you will feel pleased to watch it despite many criticisms revolving around differences between the original and this new version.King Kong will make you laugh, cry, and sit at the edge of your seat.

I am a big King Kong fan and I came into this movie very skeptical. However, I was so pleased with it that I had to go out and buy it on DVD. I waited and bought the extended edition which makes the movie even longer. However, the added scenes actually make it even more enjoyable to watch, rather than detract. I will go out on a limb here and say that from this writer's perspective, this version of Kong is better than the 1933 original not just because of superior technology (although I am a sucker for giant, realistic,life-like creatures battling it out with each other), but the overall acting, pacing, character development, and above all, interaction between our heroine Ann and the giant ape far surpasses the original. This version of Kong is the most believable and expressive creature you will ever see. Regardless of its length, King Kong is BIG screen entertainment. From the arrival on Skull Island, to the magnificant climax on the Empire State Building, this is just a cinematic masterpiece that you will want to own & watch over and over again, rather than toss in the forgotten DVD bin.

Beyond that,  aside from some droning moments,  this film is a gem.Naomi Watts should have been awarded for her performance in this film.  Her affect is pristine.  The watcher need only look into her eyes to feel what she's feeling.  The very movements of her facial muscles are perfect in their pitch.  She does well,  I doubt that Jackson had to do much work within her scenes.  One doesn't even notice the foreground or added characters / actors when Watts is on screen.The action in this film is beyond fun.  It's entertaining and eye popping.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3UNGGV9D2UVQY	Stephane Lauzon	If you know cinema how can you like this piece of garbage. First of all, it was way way overlong with many unneccesary scenes like the one with the characters battling giants insects in a cave, what's that all about? it's boring and it deviates from the main plot of the movie. When I went to see this movie I've just seen the original 1933 version and I was worried that Jackson will humanised the ape which is supposed to be wild like in the 33 version. Boy was I right! He made Kong almost human just to get cheap emotions from the audience, the scenes with Naomi Watts entertaining him and trying to make contact with him were laughable and so stupid that Jackson should be ashame of himself. This is only special effects and nothing else, it has nothing to do with cinema at all. Jack Black is a big mistake of casting, I like him usually but in this mess he was a jerk and not likable at all. Adrian Brody did ok with the bad script he had because he's a great actor as for Naomi Watts she made a fool of herself and all she do is cry for nothing during all the movie. This version of King Kong is very very bad and all of the edge and creativity of the 33 version is lost here without a doubt.

However, the true Kong fan will be very disappointed if he expects to see the original movie redone with state-of-the-art special effects. The movie is an hour too long, with everything over done. The acting is so-so. Naomi Watts is ok as Ann Darrow, but she surely isn't up to Fay Wray's performance in the original. Jack Black fails in his attempt to equal the role of Carl Denham, masterfully played by Robert Armstrong in the 1933 release. Credibility is lacking in many ways. The antique cars are painted bright colors, something that never happened in 1933. Dress and language are totally ""today"" with words like ""stiffed"", an expression invented in the 70's, sticking out like a sore thumb. I could go on and on, but you get the picture. This movie could be improved by editing out over an hour of superfluous material. Enjoy it as an action packed adventure, but don't expect to see an improved King Kong.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3I69IXPTDVKQF	Stephen B. O'Blenis	"The new ""King Kong"" is one of the most epic action/adventure movies ever, a mega-budget blockbuster done the way mega-budget blockbusters oughtta be (but often aren't): that is, involving great characters (human or otherwise) in a great high-octane story that's fascinating, emotionally powerful, and completely engaging on many levels.  This is, without question, the real deal.Set in the Great Depression, a number of struggling and/or out-of-luck actors, actresses, film crewmen and a playright, and an oceangoing ship's crew, all find themselves cajoled, persuaded, conned or otherwise weaseled by shifty but humorous filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black, who alternates masterfully between being the underdog-with-a-dream you want to root for and the pompous, manipulative, pretentious little schmuck you want a giant gorilla to come along and stomp on) into sailing across the world to an uncharted island.  On this mysterious island whose location Denham has somehow become privy to, he plans to film his latest masterpiece, a work that he's certain will bring him worldwide fame, vast wealth and immortal respect, as certain as he was with each of his previous movies which went by with moderate (at most) success each time.  His enthusiasm for his project isn't shared by the studio he tries to get financing from, so he secures their support by setting sail in the dead of night before the studio has a chance to pull their technicians and film equipment from the boat where they were staying when the studio was actually thinking of funding Denham's film.A good portion of the film's early going is taken up with odd but effective humor, but things change when the ship comes upon Skull Island itself, where the characters - and in particular Ann Darrow (brilliantly played by Naomi Watts from ""The Ring"" and ""The Ring Two"") find themselves encountering the ruins of an apparantly once-thriving and possibly quite advanced civilization, the remnants of the island's human population, a plethora of live dinosaurs (including a race of predators the size of tyrannosaurs with the speed and agility of velociraptors), ferocious giant bugs, and of course the most jaw-dropping titan of them all, the one the island's survivors fear and worship: Kong.You probably know a lot more of what happens next if you saw even a sliver of the ad blitz that engulfed everything in the months before the movie's release (MUST they show So much in the previews?) but in case you're like me and try to avoid seeing too much in advance I won't get too much into specifics of the rest of the movie.  Just a few generalizations: there are epic confrontations, scenes of tremendous beauty and tenderness, mountain-sized thrills and scares, more strange humor that somehow manages to work with the huge nature of the film instead of throwing a monkeywrench into it, and a fair bit of insight into mankind's quest for wonder and awe, and the dichotomy between that quest and the way man often ends up corrupting or destroying the dreams it does attain.  And mention must be made of the outstanding effects, particularly on the King himself.  You can read Kong's emotions and state of mind brilliantly through facial expressions and body language, to an extent where it's hard to believe it's not all real.  All this in one movie, one of the biggest and boldest and best ever."	5.0	Awesome From Start To Finish; Thrilling And Moving	2006-02-15	5	5	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AGMW3I34INNYG	Stephen Cannon	"King Kong as delivered by Peter Jackson is a period film, a character piece, and a monster mash, with a smattering of operatic tragedy.  Based on Merian Cooper's original 1933 film, Jackson's Kong is fun entertainment that doesn't feel like its three-hour length.  Jack Black gives a surprisingly reigned in but very goood performance as desperate would-be filmmaker Carl Denham, who has come into possession of a map, supposedly leading to a mysterious island.  This is where Denham thinks he will shoot his masterpiece.  After rounding up a crew (including Colin Hanks, with a nice turn in a small role as Denham's assistant Preston), a cast (including Naomi Watts' unemployed Vaudeville actress Ann Darrow), and a screen writer (Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll), Denham sets out in a ratty looking boat to find his ""Skull Island.""The key to making this film work is fleshing out the characters enoiugh that we care about them, which director Jackson and his screenwriting partners Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh seem to specialize in.  We don't see a monster for the first 70 minutes of the film, and that's ok, if you take the time to enjoy the human characters.  Black's Denham is an obsessed, unsinkable alcoholic; Watts'Ann has never found stability in her life, but she thinks she may see it in two places within this film; and Brody's take on Jack is honest - he's the true bohemian, living for his cherished art of theater.  He's a little ashamed of the fact that he has to lower himself to screenplays to make ends meet.THEN the monsters arrive.  The effects are astounding, although they are not always seemless.  Kong himself is beautifully realized; the range of emotion he conveys is broad but believable.  In fact, the key to this movie is whether this synthetic creature wins you over.  In my case, he did, and then some.  The other creatures on the island are a treat as well; grand and eye-popping,  even if some are on the disgusting side.  The monster battles themselves are mindblowing.In the end, Kong has a lot to offer.  Aside from the action, there is some real heart in this picture.  The plot is a little thin at times, but this is, after all, a remake of one of the most beloved B-movies of all time.  Peter Jackson has developed a style of visualizing and telling a story that is his own, and for this reviewer, it's hard to beat.  The bond between Kong and Ann is deeply touching, though most unusual. Action, drama, and even soem humorous touches make this a nice, broad piece of film entertainment.  (James Newton Howard, replacing Howard Shore late in the process, delivers a nice score as well.)  May not be suitable for some children due to scary creatures and violence.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AT07UZQQR7ZEH	"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov..."	"With his fabulous remake of KING KONG (2005), Peter Jackson tops his Oscar-winning LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and enters a movie lover's pantheon for me.  This is my favorite film of last year and it could become one of my personal favorite movies of all time.  It is that good.  And it's not really a ""guilty pleasure"" because virtually every film critic, with the infamous exception of the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE critic, loved it and gave it highest ratings.Watching KING KONG in a theater for a vast and enthralling 187 minutes, I found director/co-producer/co-writer Jackson frequently equaling the immortal 1933 classic.  The movie benefits enormously in being  a full 90 minutes longer than the original film.  There is more time at the beginning to establish Ann Darrow (an incandescent Naomi Watts) as a song and dance entertainer, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) as a playwright, and Jack Black as flamboyant director Carl Denham in 1932 Manhattan.  It takes 45 minutes or so to get the voyage underway, then another half hour to reach Skull Island in the South Seas.  In the original, the voyage starts only ten minutes in and reaches Skull Island almost as soon as the ship leaves Manhattan.We are on Skull Island, in Jackson's wondrous film, for maybe an hour, long enough to have enough creature battles to please any kid at heart.  But Jackson tops the original film in humanizing Kong; he treats Ann nicely and she replies in kind.  This romance was the most satisfying romance I saw in any 2005 movie, except maybe the two gay cowboys in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, which says something awesome about movies last year!  I particularly enjoyed seeing Ann and Kong watching a sunset together from a jungle cliff plateau.  This is an immensely likeable Kong, not someone who eats villagers and throws Manhattan socialite women to the street in the 1933 version.When we reach Manhattan with Kong and company, we are about 135 minutes in on a 187 minute movie with no intermission.  I remember because I needed to make a short bathroom stop during later Skull Island scenes.  That will not be a problem on home video with the pause button.  The Oscar-nominated production design and Oscar-winning visual effects of Depression era Manhattan are just stupendous here, amazingly re-created in New Zealand, Jackson's home turf.  Here he deviates a little from the original movie in having Kong be on display in a movie palace with Denham, while Jack is previewing a new play and Ann is doing song and dance in a third theater.  There is no elevated train thrown to the ground, though it is quite a sight to see Kong destroy a huge movie palace.  The movie reaches paradise when Kong and Ann go ice dancing (!) together in a snowy Central Park, then view dawn New York City together in a pink and apricot matte painting from atop the Empire State Building.  This is some of the most beautiful visual effects and production design I have ever seen.I have the double disk, widescreen format DVD of KING KONG in front of me, but am basically reviewing the theatrical experience from the beautiful Century 20 movie palace near me in Daly City.  Peter Jackson's imaginative masterpiece may be even more enthralling on letterboxed DVD, and not just for a bathroom or food break pause capability.  A second disk has almost three hours of Post-Production Diaries, the history of Skull Island, and how Depression New York City was re-created mostly in New Zealand. So if you are renting this baby, figure on three nights for the double disk edition of KING KONG.  Better yet, buy this glorious film masterpiece to enjoy over and over along with the great 1933 version, depending on which vision you are in the mood for.  I prefer Jackson's 2005 vision more, and I cannot wait to see how he tops an untoppable and unequaled movie."	5.0	My favorite movie of 2005 and maybe an all-time favorite	2006-03-29	2	0	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A24R5EW6XJVKC6	Stephen J. Miller	"Please Universal, in an age of Directors cuts can you give us a special ""Editor's Cut"" of Kong?  Limit it to 104 minutes like the original and remove all the filler of the 3 hour monster we currently have.  I don't dislike the film.  I actually like it, but I feel there is a lean and mean version of the film trapped under pounds of extra celluloid film fat.  I want to be able to watch the film over and over again without constantly fast forwarding to the good parts.  In the original I never felt the character's dialogue was overdrawn or the romance undersold, problems I find in the new version.  So please give us a 104 minute bare bones version at a reasonable price and watch your sales soar."	4.0	It was not beauty that killed the beast but length	2006-04-01	6	3	3

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	Watched the original on blu ray last week so, naturally, tho I had the 2 disc Standard Def version, I wanted to buy the extended version on Blu Ray.  And glad I did tho I received just the single disc and I see that the Blu Ray and  Digital version are offered at the same price.I watched the extended version which has many excellent scenes that were deleted.  Most of them were great and shouldn't have been removed from the theatrical version whose beginning 45 minutes just dragged on and on. This extended version really improves things for me.  The extra scenes of prehistoric encounters really were wonderful and the styragosaurs scene was actually an homage to the 33 original who also had a similar scene that was cut out and lost.  There was only one scene towards the end, which contained an army officer in a truck of solders( don't want to spoil it so I am not saying what happens in this scene) that I thought could have been left out; seemed really cheesy to me.I'm not into book reports so here's my take on the transfer quality only.  Get it.  The video is quite outstanding...beautiful color saturation and shading, wonderful depth throughout.  No grain, no artifacts, nothing to take away from  the demo transfer quality that this is.The audio is DTSHD 5.1 and, in many parts, is also demo worthy.  There really is an expansive sound stage and perfect directionality from the discreet speakers when appropriate.Unless you don't like the movie itself, there is no reason not to have this King Kong on blu ray.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks	5.0	King Kong on Blu Ray	2012-08-29	4	4	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A13121MN9TKNGR	"stevefromslc ""steve"""	"Let me ask one question.  How could Peter Jackson go from making three of the greatest films of all time to making this Hollywood stink trash?  The only film this year that I have seen that is worse than this is Serenity.  And Peter, just for the record, all your movies do not have to be three hours in length anymore.  You could have told this story in ninty minutes.The plot takes over one hour to get to the island.  This dribble of cheesy dialouge and bad acting by all three of the leads is just sad.  When we finally get to the island it takes another twenty minutes to see Kong.Then the movie was supposed to get exciting.  But Peter Jackson's sights dominate the film.  He does scence between Naomi Watts and Kong that go on for minutes that only should be brief seconds. And even the films numerous action sequences just dragged on longer than needed.And Peter Jackson tried to overkill us with the visual effects.  And as he overkilled us with these, he must have overbudgeted, because none of the film's visual and special effects are convincing.Finally, we see Kong on Ice.  Literally!  Top it all of with Jack Black's absurtly idiotic closing line, the film ends on a sour note.I once heard someone mutter at the trailer of this film, ""We had to wait for the Hobbit for this?!""  Yes, Lord of the Rings fans, we do.  Do what I would do.  Pay the seven to ten dollars on the much superior Chronicles of Narnia."	1.0	Hey Peter!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3VQSFORKH8B7O	Steven Hancock	"Peter Jackson is a master of creating big, epic action/adventure films. His three-film adaptation ofThe Lord of the Rings Trilogyis a masterpiece of modern film. So I went in to his remake ofKing Kongwith great anticipation. Sadly, a nagging feeling I had about the film turned out to be true. At 188 minutes, this film is just too long. Now, don't get me wrong, there are a number of three-hour plus movies in my collection. But with this film, what could have been an intense, action-packed film turns out to be just one elongated scene after another, nearly derailing the film. And the presentation of a ""love story"" between Kong the Ape and a human woman is kind of handled weirdly. The cast does as good a job as it can with the extended script, and the visual effects and James Newton Howard's score are really good. But this film definitely should have been under two-and-a-half hours. This is only a film for those with a huge amount of patience.Movie Grade: C+"	3.0	"TOO LONG ""KONG."""	2011-07-01	4	2	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AZCDCO6KK2T81	"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan"""	"I am not one for senseless remakes and was very skeptical about Peter Jackson taking on this classic, epecially afterKing Kong(1977) flop remake by Dino De Laurentis, but I'm happy to report thatKing Kongis well served in this remake.  Of course, the effects are superior to the original and the acting is as well, but more importantly the story retains the charm, awe, and tragic vision of the original masterpiece and becomes a masterpiece all its own.I agree with the many critics and reviewers who felt the opening third of the film was unnecessarily long.  Yes, there is some character development there and that allows us to care more for the characters, but it was over-the-top.  Nevertheless, the whole film does work and it's obvious now that Peter Jackson's work onThe Lord of the Rings Trilogywasn't a fluke.  He is a gifted director and shows his respect for the work he creates.  The same love and attention given LOTR is given to KK as well by Jackson.The film works well on every level very much likeTitanicdid, but just not with the same amount of skill and class that Cameron mustered up for his epic work.  I completely enjoyed this film, in spite of the painfully slow start and highly recommend this edition for the many extras.  It would be nice, however, if Hollywood would stop jerking us around with all these ""new"" editions to buy.  They should put out their best product first and be done with it.  I don't need to buy 3 versions of the same film and perhaps if we all stop doing that, maybe Hollywood would come around and stop trying to rip us off with this so far successful tactic."	4.0	King Kong is Gigantic Film Making	2006-12-05	2	1	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1FJFMX9S83298	Steven smith	The 1933 version of King Kong, which is the original, is perhaps the first film to rightfully be labeled a 'classic.' It was unique in its day and age, and was during an era where the citizens of America wanted to really watch adventure movies that had them on the edge of their seat. The entertainment industry was small back then, so you can bet that when King Kong came out, the audiences were LOVING it!Now it is many years since then, and the citizens of America have watched many adventure/horror/monster films. Less and less films seem to be putting people at the edge of their seat, however. But this version of King Kong, which does justice to the former, really does do just that: it entertains!Follow the characters on an epic (sometimes dull) adventure to Skull Island, where they meet savage natives who desire to sacrifice one of the main characters, Anne, to their god-on-earth: Kong. However, as time goes on, Anne and Kong experience a strong friendship. The things they went through on Skull Island (fighting dinosaurs and sliding down vines,) bring them close together. This truly is a modern-day tale of Beauty & The Beast.Like mentioned before, some moments are dull, and the movie could have done with some editing. It is long, but perhaps rightfully so. The story is enriched in this new version, and we get to delve deeper into the characters and their psyche.Peter Jackson undoubtedly worked tirelessly on this film: he deserves our applause!Buy this DVD; it is definitely worth the money!	5.0	Does much Justice to the former version!	2006-07-24	2	1	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AN12XTC6ARQQC	Steven Utley	"The original KING KONG is very likely my favorite movie; there's no saying how many times I've seen it during the past half a century, beyond ""plenty.""  I tend to regard the sequels and remakes and knock-offs (with the single exception of the original MIGHTY JOE YOUNG) as bad ideas whose time came, and went -- leaving the one and only real KING KONG undiminished alongside other classic movies (e.g., CASABLANCA, CITIZEN KANE, THE WIZARD OF OZ) that stand up to repeated viewings, even a lifetime's worth of viewings, and, what's more, resist being improved upon.To give it its due, Peter Jackson's KING KONG isn't as bad as the 1976 remake; it gives good monster -- think JURASSIC PARK with a big ape and a dash of ALIENS.Nevertheless, I take away points for the silly, yea, verily, embarrassing relationship developed between Jackson's Ann Darrow and big ape; for the film's multiple offenses against the laws of physics (at least as those apply everywhere except in bloated Hollywood action flicks) (I suppose I should be grateful, though, that nobody in this film outruns a fireball); and for its overinflation of everything that worked perfectly in the 1933 version so that hardly anything works at all.And that is the heart of my disaffection: Jackson's evident belief that More Is Necessarily Better.  The original Kong battled a tyrannosaur?  Jackson's Kong battles three count 'em three of the critters -- while performing a trapeze act!  Twelve sailors meet horrible death in the original film?  Seventeen meet even more horrible death in Jackson's flick!  Four airplanes attack the original Kong atop the Empire State Building and one gets knocked out of the sky?  Jackson's Kong is attacked by six airplanes and dispatches three of them!  The original KING KONG lasts 103 minutes?  Hah!  Jackson's lasts days.I doubt seriously that I'll ever again watch this movie all the way through all by myself.  And I am a guy who, during the past month, has, all by himself, viewed the 1933 version twice and listened to its audio commentary track on a third occasion."	2.0	Just another bad idea whose time had come	2006-04-03	11	6	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1GBV46XFEWM86	stitchwork	Is nothing sacred anymore!!!! I understand that this was peter Jackson's inspiration to become a director. Yet, he couldn't leave it alone. He had a long and very successful period doing the LOTR Trilogies, and the extended versions. He had to get caught up in the spotlight, and remake nothing but a capitolist CG attempt of an extremely boring computer game on screen. It doesn't matter that he stuck to the story, this is an example of how unoriginal Hollywood and mainstream movies in general have become. They've ran out of ideas - so they make hybrid parodies. This was depressing, if you love King Kong stick to the original.	1.0	king kong	2006-04-12	20	10	10
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ADE9OU2OLWS3N	Stone Cold Nuts	I enjoyed the special effects, but I didn't think the casting was appropriate.  Jack Black had moments where he really fit the part, but at other times he simply suffered from type-casting in his frat-house movies; and that really comes across in this film.  The self-absorbed lead actor and the leading lady faired much better.  Story sticks to the original from the 1930s, and that is probably a good thing.  Initial scenes on Skull Island were awesome and frightening.  The script moves from a tongue-in-cheek version of the original to some lame efforts as a serious epic production.  The movie was probably about 30-45 minutes too long.	3.0	Kong Falls Short	2006-04-29	3	1	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A6R8XUE6MJLMC	Stuart Winer	This movie is very beautiful and poetic and a fun amusement park ride, but I left thinking that it didn't really reach it's full potential, despite its great length and all the technical wizardry.I just didn't feel like the characters were fully fledged.  Many minor ones were cardboard cut-outs who's main purpose was to get killed at certain points along the way, which was fine.  But others who we should have been deeply invested in felt like actors in a drama instead of full characters.  They needed more conversation and self-awareness and humor, like LOTR had.Kong himself was brilliant - as an ape he was a wordless pantomime character who transmitted feeling and emotion perfectly and was a great tragic figure, and that alone will make this movie a milestone.  I felt terrible as the planes kept circling back, again and again, unstoppable and relentless. As a force of modernity, they were the grim reaper made real.Still, 4 stars for the hypnotizing beauty of Naomi Watts.  She can gaze longingly or knowingly or despairingly like a living, breathing Greek Goddess in the midst of High Drama, all day long. Her star is assured.__________________________________Some details that are completely irrelevant in a fantasy like this:1) Gorillas are in Africa, not the South Pacific. Kong should have been a giant Orangutan.2) Giant animals require thousands of square miles to hunt and feed. The island was too small.  The best bets in real life which had large fauna and a unique ecosystems are Madagascar or Australia.  But early man killed off large fauna everywhere in the world for the last 100,000 years - probably by hunting the young before they became too large.3) Interestingly, 300+M years ago before vertebrates conquered the land, earth had a higher oxygen content in the atmosphere which supported giant insects, including primitive land-scorpions 5' long and dragonflies with a 2' wingspan - not unlike the movie.4) If Kong was 6' tall he would have weighed 350 lbs.  At 25' tall, assuming you cube the scale as mass increases in parallel to volume, King Kong would have weighed (350)* 4.1(3rd pwr) = 350*69 = 24,150 lbs. - around 12 tons, or twice the size of a large African elephant - a big ape indeed.  T-Rex fossils indicate that they were around 5-7 tons back 70M years ago but the creatures in the movie looked to be about the same size as Kong.But apes are about 5 times as strong as humans of the same weight because they have denser muscle fibers.  So he would have been at least as strong as: 69*5 people, or 345 people combined - all big , football-player sized guys. Kong was truly fully-realized giant on the screen.  One has to look closely to even notice the CGI.  Kong makes its predecessors and hundreds of others look like well-intended puppet shows. It sets the new standard for major movies.	4.0	Gorgeous Epic - But not what it could have been.	2005-12-24	4	3	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2JEONEOLE4FD2	"Subash S L ""slsubash"""	Unlike James Cameroon who has literally disappeard into some abyss (actually he's been making documentaries of the doomed ship and such) after his 12-Oscar winning Titanic, Peter Jackson went straight to the sets to create his next epic after his 12-oscar winning The Lord of the Rings 3 - Return of the King. And what a creation King Kong has been.Two things that the 1967 version is popular for and that which weren't carried over to this version are: 1. Scantily clad heroine in revealing shots, 2. King Kong indulging in shady acts with the heroine. Peter Jackson did good by not carrying over such spoilers into his version.The special effects are amazing. It is going to be a very difficult task of creating a better Kong than this one for sometime. Kong's fight with the T-Rexes is one thing worth watching countless times. Other oscars are also truly deserving for sound editing and sound effects.One situation that was too difficult to accept was the run of the Brachiosauruses with the crew dodging the animals while running along with them. Chances are that none of the crew could have survived such a stampede while simultaneously being attacked by other predators. The extended shooting scenes of Kong from the aircraft in the concluding scences of the movie could have also been avoided.Check out the lovely piano of the beautiful scene of a tearful and angelic Naomi on the deck of the ship as she acts and emotes a scene for the film that she is cast(in the story of the movie).Great movie-making and worth your while.	5.0	A Giant of a movie	2006-08-26	6	5	1

The action is spectacular! I was literally on the edge of my seat for the last 2 1/2 hours(the first 1/2 hour was a wee bit slow but the movie wouldn't be the same without it).2. The special effect were fantastic. ""The popcorn movie of the millennium, setting a new standard for special effects wizardry.""Jamie Gillies, APOLLO GUIDE says.3. The story is the best! It is 1933, and vaudeville actress Ann Darrow (Oscar nominee for 21 Grams, NAOMI WATTS) has found herself-like so many other New Yorkers during the Great Depression-without the means to earn a living. Unwilling to compromise and allow herself to sink into a career in burlesque, she considers her limited options while aimlessly wandering the streets of Manhattan. When her hunger drives her to unsuccessfully try to steal an apple from a fruit vendor's stall, she is rescued-literally- by filmmaker and multiple hyphenate Carl Denham (JACK BLACK of The School of Rock).It seems that the entrepreneur-raconteur-adventurer is no stranger to theft, having that day lifted the only existing print of his most recent and unfinished film from under his studio executives' noses when they threatened to pull his completion funds. Carl has until the end of the day to get his crew onboard the Singapore-bound tramp steamer, the S.S. Venture, in hopes of completing his travelogue/action film. With that, the showman is certain he will finally achieve the personal greatness he knows awaits him around the corner...and although the crew believe that corner to be Singapore, Denham actually hopes to find and capture on film the mysterious place of legend: Skull Island.Unfortunately for Carl, his headlining actress has pulled out of his project, but his search for a size-four leading lady (the costumes have all been made) has, fatefully, led him to Ann. The struggling actress is reluctant to sign on with Denham, until she learns that the up-and-coming, socially relevant playwright Jack Driscoll (Oscar winner for The Pianist, ADRIEN BRODY) is penning the screenplay-the fees his friend Carl pays for potboiling adventure are a welcome supplement to Driscoll's nominal income from his stage plays.With his newly discovered star and coerced screenwriter reluctantly onboard, Denham's ""moving picture ship"" heads out of New York Harbor...and toward a destiny that none aboard could possibly foresee.(King Kong)4. The actors are great! Joining Watts, Black and Brody is an accomplished ensemble cast from around the globe. German star THOMAS KRETSCHMANN (U-571) portrays Captain Englehorn, commander of the Venture, who allows Denham and his ever-increasing bribes to persuade him to endanger the lives of his crew by searching for Skull Island. COLIN HANKS (Orange County) is Preston, Denham's put-upon assistant and unwitting moral compass, who attempts to keep his boss in check and the production from spiraling out of control. Young actor JAMIE BELL (Billy Elliot) plays Jimmy, the youngest crew member, whose experiences onboard the Venture prove more fantastical than any old salt's seafaring yarn. EVAN PARKE lends his talents to the role of first mate Hayes, keeping a watchful eye on young Jimmy and serving as Englehorn's conscience. KYLE CHANDLER takes on the character of Bruce Baxter, a ""B""-movie-level leading man cast opposite Ann Darrow in Denham's adventure movie. ANDY SERKIS (who performed the role of the CGI character Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy) provides both on-set performance reference and motion-capture performance for the ""Eighth Wonder of the World""...the title character of King Kong; he also appears onscreen as the eccentric sailor in charge of the Venture's galley, Lumpy the Cook.I myself have seen this movie twice and hope to go see it again!

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A17Y4FJ42QUDSG	tchaten	I got this 2 disc set about a week before it was released.  First off Peter Jackson's version of Kong is the greatest portrayed on film, he changes a monster special ef. film into a tragic love story.  He created something very incredible and unique.The dvd:Disc 1:The audio is amazing on this dvd, along with the crystal clear pictureExtras Disc One: Ads basically, the first for a car it shows some of what went into making the ad and also a movie trailer not for Kong thoughDisc 2!:Post Production Diaries, these are great, although they left off Week 13 the Howard Shore score diary :(I just love these PDs they are truly one of the greatest things Peter Jackson has done in the making of KK05: he lets us know practically everything that went into this film.Skull Island Feature: wow!  This is a true gem, you learn the history of skull island from beginning to end, don't want to ruin any of the details of the history, but all I can say is watch it it is a real treat and it lets you know some of those mysteries behind skull island.NY Feature: A very good feature that goes into 1933 NY and details some aspects that you might not of picked up on when watching Kong.OVERALLThis is one of the truly great works of film in the 21st Century by the greatest director, everyone should truly enjoy this mans profilling of a dream in directing king kong.With the PJ's 2 Disc Special Edition of King Kong and the Production Diaries creates one amazing 4 disc set that is virtually complete, this is one of the great works of our time.I am just waiting until the Extended Edition release in November hopefully.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A18RDX4OF4JWTW	TC	One of the sadder things to happen to movie's in the last decade or so is that big budget popcorn munching movies and high quality, well scripted, well acted, well directed films have become mutually exclusive. Thankfully director Peter Jackson doesn't subscribe to that notion delivering first the excellent Lord of the Rings trilogy, and now the possibly even better King Kong.  Personally I've never found the Kong movies appealing in the past but gave this one a shot due to the compelling trailers and to the fact that after LotR Jackson has earned the benefit of the doubt.  True to his recent form Jackson does not dissapoint. King Kong is without a doubt the finest film I've seen this year big budget extravaganza or not.It comes as no surprise that the film looks amazing as Jackson seems to have perfected the perfect balance of CGI and set design, no the surprise comes in the casting and the marvelously written script.  I've heard other reviewers question the casting of Adrian Brody, Jack Black and even Naomi Watts, but I'm not one of them, these fine actors really bring their characters to life in a thoroughly believable way.  One could also call the 1930's New York a character as it provides the perfect backdrop for our intrepid heroes.  The film is so wonderfully paced that you hardly notice that it takes a full hour before Kong actually appears.  This kind of exposition is often bungled badly by lesser directors, but not by Jackson who really understands that we have to know these characters if the film is to have any emotional impact.  When we finally reach Skull Island, where most of the action takes place, we're thoroughly briefed and ready for a rousing adventure which somehow combines the best elements of the Indiana Jones movies, and Jurassic Park.  Again I've read criticism that all Jackson did with his creatures is rehash earlier movie monsters, but I disagree.  The slugs that suck up their prey were among the scariest monsters I've ever scene.When it comes down to it, however, it's not the effects that make this a great movie; instead it's the fine script and wonderful acting.  For the first time in any Kong movie I actually felt empathy for the great ape mostly from gazing into the beautiful eyes of Naomi Watts.  Watt's performance really does make this movie along with the performance of Kong himself brought to life through CGI wizardry and from the performance of the excellent Andy Sirkus (who did the same for the equally wonderful Gollum in LotR).  The sunset scene with these two characters on the island, and the sunrise scene in New York actually brought tears to my eyes.  Tears in a monster movie?  Absolutely!  You see that's the difference between Jackson and other big-budget directors, he envisions films that can wow you and tug at your heartstrings at the same time.  Not only does he envision them but he brings them to life in magical ways for our viewing pleasure.  Heck, if Mr. Jackson did a remake of the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes I'd probably go see it.  He's that good.While most of my praise so far has been directed at Peter Jackson and Naomi Watts, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fine performances from Adrian Brody, Jack Black and the fine supporting cast including, but not limited to, a small but fine performance4 from Colin Hanks.  These characters all have a few great moments which is no small feat in a movie that features a beautiful woman and a 25 foot Ape.In the end I can't find any fault in this movie, its wonderful escapism and an emotional wallop to boot.  Thanks for the Christmas present Peter Jackson.	5.0	The Ultimate Popcorn Muncher	2005-12-15	2	1	1

Stop comparing this and the first 'King Kong' movie (as for the 70's version is out of context - and ready to be forgotten). The first 'King Kong' is a classic. Is untouchable. See this new version as... a New movie, if like there was no Kong in movie history.The reviewer Paully said this film is 'technically well done - like the 'Star Wars' movies...' (I think he talk about the newer Episodes, I, II and III) BUT the new 'Star Wars' (and, let's be realistic, the old ones) lacks a good screenplay, lacks good interpretations (though they all have great actors!) and MOST OF ALL, lacks a great director, like Peter Jackson. Period.As for the movie I think is really amazing. I thank Peter for - this time - get into a marvellous and extravagant movie with so-realistic unrealistic inhabitants and fabulous jungles - Skull Island and New York.And - my opinion only - the special effects are the MOST incredible that I've seen so far. I really was amazed and touched by the beauty and by the beast.I heard someone saying that Kong is a CGI character?! Don't believe!	5.0	Peter Jackson, the real King	2006-04-25	7	5	2

Before I watched this movie, I had heard it was long and boring; but it was the exact opposite of that. The movie was an action packed film, and there were barely any slow parts in it. The story is about a director who is trying to make it big. Only he is very slimy and commits many lies through the making of the film. The crew manages to make it to an island that contains a huge monkey(King Kong). Everyone is scared but excited at the same time. The ending is incredibly sad but the journey through the movie is worth it. Jack Black brings humor into the film. But the five star part of the movie is the special effects, and how realistic the different creatures look.	4.0	Amazing	2006-06-12	14	11	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1E7QUM8DG0D16	Teresa Medeiros	"I have to confess that this is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Yes, I know the jungle scenes are a little over-the-top and my stoic husband can't even watch the ""bug"" scene without covering up his eyes but all of its excesses only make me love it more.This new version soars from the breathtaking imagination of director Peter Jackson. The same strengths Jackson showed in LORD OF THE RINGS are in dazzling display here. Although there are enough amazing CGI special effects to satisfy even the most jaded STAR WARS/STAR TREK geek (including me), he's never willing to sacrifice heart and intimacy for spectacle. While KONG is a sprawling rollercoaster thrill ride of a movie--the original KING KONG meets INDIANA JONES meets JURASSIC PARK--it's Naomi Watts luminous portrayal of Ann Darrow that steals our hearts (and Kong's). An incurable romantic at heart, I actually turned to my husband after the movie and said, ""I wish they'd have shown more scenes developing their relationship"" before remembering that I was talking about a woman and a giant gorilla.If you don't mind your guys a trifle bit hairy, you've always found a little Alpha male chest thumping to be endearing, and morning breath isn't an issue, the new Kong just may be the guy for you!It occurred to me as I watched the movie that this Kong has a lot in common with the heroes of many of my favorite romance novels:1) He adores Ann and finds her antics endlessly amusing.2) He's so attentive he can recognize her by her smell alone3) He rejects every other woman once they meet (hurling them out of his path like rag dolls)3) He's keenly jealous of every other man in her life (hurling them out of his path like rag dolls)4) He'd do anything to protect her, including sacrifice his own life.What's not to love about a big old monkey like that?(Originally published on the website of author Teresa Medeiros at [...]"	5.0	One of My All-Time Favorites	2008-07-15	0	0	0

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A268EEWUXYCA8Q	Terry Mesnard	When King Kong was first released in the 1930s, people hadn't seen anything like it before.  It was a technical marvel that thrilled and chilled audiences across the nation.  In fact, some of the scenes were deemed too scary for the audience (the now famous spider sequence) and were cut.  Now, in 2005, Peter Jackson has once again shown why he is the king of the epic film by recreating pretty damn faithfully the original experience but doing something even more wonderful:  adding heart and humanity.The original King Kong was a fiercesome beast.  From ripping heads off with disdain, ripping wings, destroying everything he touches, Kong was more monster than anything.  Sure he had an affection for Fay Wraye's character and at the end you do feel sorry for him.  But what was missing from his leering, toothy gaze was the heart that Jackson has found.  There are scenes of such humanity between Ann Darrow and Kong that you can almost forget he is a 25 foot Gorilla.  From the beginning when Ann performs Vaudeville prat falls to keep Kong from killing her to the sentimental (almost too much? But definitely needed) scene in the park, Kong is shown as a creature that can love, can feel and can be more human than monster.  You get a sense near the end that Kong has learned.  His character has progressed from the beginning.  And that makes what happens next all the more tragic and heart-breaking.Andy Serkis who did terrific work as Gollum once again goes above and beyond in his duty as Kong.  Having studied gorillas in the habitat (involving a much maligned trip to Africa that Peter begged him not to do for safety reasons) Serkis nails Kong's behaviour patterns and thought process.  Between him and the best CG I've seen, King Kong is a beast with sadness.  You can see it in his eyes and his movements.  Perfect.King Kong is long.  At 3 hours it is about double the original film.  How is this possible?  Well, there's more character development.  The first act is comprised of the adventurers actually reaching the island and concerns itself with developing the myriad of characters on the boat.  It also expresses the possible love that could blossom between Ann and Jack before Kong steps into the picture.  I'll admit, the first act was a bit over-long.  It was important to the film, but it got the point where I wanted something exciting to happen.Once that exciting moment happens, though, the thrill ride begins.  What follows once they reach the island is thrilling sequence after sequence.  But unlike other movies involving dinosaurs (Jurassic Park 3), this film has emotion, characters worth caring about and heart.I can't recommend this movie enough.  It does everything a remake should.  It is faithful to the original but builds upon it both creatively and technically.  You will laugh, you will jump and you will possibly cry at this story of beauty and the beast.A must see.	5.0	A Masterpiece	2005-12-15	5	3	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A18JS70P4A2KIS	T. F. Slavin	I agree with others that this is one amazing movie. It is magnificent to watch in a theater, especially King Kong. The natives of Skull Island acted and looked terrifying, especially when they killed some of the movie crew. The rest of the actors do their bit extremely well.This movie is a great example of a movie being perfect because of it's imperfections. A movie that has the heroine stand in her high heels on top of the Empire State Building clearly is not a reality based movie. In real life, she would have been blown off in half a second by the wind. But the effect is real enough that it triggered my fear of heights. I wanted to yell at the woman to get down. Or just jump and end my anxiety. The whole movie is filled with this unreal but real quality.We brought our kids, 7 and 10. They spent a good deal of the middle third of the movie in the theater hallway. Even I wound up there during the Spider Pit scene. But other kids in the theater didn't seem so grossed out. My wife says she would not have taken the kids had she realized the violence in that part of the film.That said, this is a highly unusual movie, not something you will see so well done every day. The film is extremely beautiful and moving (as in tender, scary, freaked out, funny). It would be a shame not to see it and especially not to see it in a theater.	5.0	Magnificent, if imperfect, maybe not for young kids	2005-12-17	4	1	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AVODFKS6F11SR	ThatGuy	"I despise ""reviews"" by people that enjoy their own writing, and go out of their way to write SPOILERS and High School Book Reports about movies, so I won't be doing that.  I'll just describe to you what I felt without giving too much away.I loved most of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and this made me a Peter Jackson fan, though I'd seen some of his previous work and didn't know it at the time.  This movie was totally miscast, practically from top to bottom.  Jack Black should be on his knees in front of his agent 24/7 for landing him this role, and though he's a relatively talented comedic um... actor(?)(translation = routine, nothing special) I really felt that his inability to act his way out of his single facial expression killed this movie entirely.  For those of you who have seen the film, or will see it, just imagine his only thought being ""Uh-oh, I think I just crapped in my pants"" whenever you lay eyes upon his face during the film.  You'll see what I mean.  Naomi Watts was tedious to watch after a while, as the direction was just bad.  I think that Jackson told her to just wing it, and kept filming, as some scenes between the ""Beauty and the Beast"" are obviously improvised, drag on literally forever, and some are purely moronic (see ""juggling scene"" on the mountain.)  Oddly enough, there was barely any dialogue in the film once the characters hit Skull Island, so I found myself sitting through Jackson ""Signature"" endlessly, needlessly loooong scenes of panning, swooping, tilting, as well as a VERY odd addition of slow-motion scenes that were used as a gimmick in an attempt to breathe something ""supernatural"" and LORD OF THE RINGS-like into this horrible film.  It was nice however, to see a big Gorilla portrayed as an actual GORILLA, which was very refreshing and fun to watch for the most part.  Yeah, the special effects were nice, so kudos to his team, but even they couldn't carry this bomb for me. (Oh, and the FX duplicating Ye Olde NYC looked so horribly fake that I was shocked.  Those guys should stick with fantasy & monsters & talking trees.) Adrien Brody wasted his talent in this junk, as well as the Liam-Neeson-Lite actor that played the ship captain.  See the film anyway, just to say you did.  The ending was actually worth the wait though, to watch Jack Black ruin the famous tag-line."	2.0	Just not worth it. What a MISCAST bomb.	2006-08-03	6	3	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2H2YJ1TZV6I09	The Doctor	"Despite all it's criticism over the years, I've always been fond of the 1976 remake of ""King Kong"" and Peter Jackson's version doesn't better it, in my opinion.  Obviously the special effects in Jackson's version far surpass those of De Laurentis', but I find the '76 version to be more realistic and less heavy handed.  You can actually feel Jackson pulling at your heart strings with his ""Kong,"" and it is is over-played.  Additionally, the film is far too long, with a great deal of repetitive and boring scenes.  None of the characters, barring Kong, are particularly well-developed.  The characterisation of Kong though, is a marvel."	2.0	Dull	2006-04-14	8	5	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A8BY9TZTKQU3J	The Fingers On My Keyboard	My biding image of this movie is that of one grey, rubbery lump collapsing on top of another.But it's a fair bit of a journey getting there and beyond.Cynics may think that had it not been for Peter Jackson's reputation as director of `The Lord of the Rings' preceding him on this movie, it's likely no one would have looked for a remake of a love story between a woman and a giant ape. A contemporary version would be at equal risk of becoming facetious and insincere as the original might have been, appealing more to the camp-and-outrage dollar rather than heartstrings. Can, then, this movie stand on its own, independent of what one expects, and is virtually certain of receiving, from Jackson and his team at Weta? The `King Kong' for our time isn't perfect, but, had `The Lord of the Rings' not been made, Jackson's rendering still would have made a strong statement about his eye as a storyteller working with film, and his concerns pertaining to entertainment and escapism, complemented by a knowledge of what's necessary for emotional resonance.Everyone looks for the showdowns and pursuits involving creatures in this movie, and, while the wait for them is slightly testing, patience pays off in confrontations and chases that become unrelentingly manic the moment they start. Hence, the barrage of dinosaur stampedes, attacks by oversized critters that could only have come from Jackson's demented imagination, and some tremendous vigour from the headlining monkey himself, be it in taking on three T-Rexes or Broadway. There is the occasional echo of things done before - Adrien Brody, Jack Black and the rest of the rescue team running frantically between the legs of dinosaurs (some fortunately emerging untouched, others sardonically trampled to death) is reminiscent of horsemen scuttling about the feet of huge tusked creatures in `The Return of the King' - but that's more than made up for with imaginative, original sequences that genuinely keep surprising you and keep you on the edge. A fight between Kong and two T-Rexes as he struggles to save Naomi Watts amidst a tangle of vines is staged with such inventiveness you can't help but laugh. The grisly confrontation between the last dinosaur and Kong that follows sees the camera placing the audience in the very midst of the savagery as the two wrestle with unfettered brutality. Kong's rampage through the streets of New York, more than a spectacle of gleefully bestial destruction, is fuelled by such rage that it's actually heartbreaking, indeed the stirring culmination of a truly moving love story developed between Kong and Naomi Watts.But the success achieved in fully forming the characters of the leading man and lady is as far as the characterisation goes in this movie. Black's obsessive, self-proclaimed craftsman in film drives the story forward from one incredible development to another (he is, after all, the reason that Kong leaves Skull Island), but his learning his lesson in the end, about how his ambitiousness has proven detrimental and destroyed a bond that enabled Beauty to tame the Beast, is unconvincing, and exacerbated by an abrupt ending that sees Black's character reaching a realisation that's inadequately expressed by the movie's closing line (`It was beauty that killed the beast'). Brody gets the chance to be an action man here, but that he turns out to be more than that owes much to Watts, who conveys convincingly the confusion and dilemma over her feelings for an animal and a man, an inconceivable, absurd love triangle of sorts.All the character strands are primarily introduced on the voyage to Skull Island (which outlasts its welcome, as noble as the writers' intentions in having it are), and what's regrettable is how hardly any of the peripheral characters' stories are resolved. A brief allusion to `Heart of Darkness' as the crew sets foot on the island, for one, makes a nice little thoughtful surprise, but it's ultimately never clear if it really speaks for any character in particular. It might say something for Jamie Bell's character. The problem is his seeming attachment to Watts's character is never properly established, if it's meant to exist at all, and thus doesn't receive much in the way of the audience's investment. His shady past isn't reconciled with his inexplicably urgent need to see the rescue mission through (which, at best, is weakly justified by his supposed feelings for Ann Darrow); and his close relations with members of the ship's crew are given little more than a perfunctory examination, and are only evident by Bell's dramatic emoting over the death of the man who found him as a child, which in itself doesn't evoke sympathy due to a failure to set down an emotional precedent. What `shackles' might Bell's character have grown so used to that his desire to discover what intrigues him should threaten to be deadened, only to be rejuvenated by a desperate `need to know', which then, supposedly, drives him to seek out the kidnapped Ann Darrow? Whatever the mysteries of his character, whether or not they be necessary, we never see any more of him beyond Skull Island, which naturally leads to the question: Was he, or any of the supporting cast of characters for that matter, really necessary, or little more than a cursory attempt at populating a film that doesn't seem to have much need for them, other than providing a means for the lead characters to remain miraculously unscathed? The `Heart of Darkness' reference might even have said something for Kong, but how it's connected to his loneliness or inaccessibility as a beast and, therefore, a character unfortunately prone to misunderstanding, or fear before understanding, isn't clear either. A palpable wish to connect is at least demonstrated empathetically by a monkey of considerable nuance (hats off, Andy Serkis and the animation team), and the writers and director aptly capitalise on this to map the heart of the movie.But this adventure does sweep one away - one truly has to see it to fully appreciate how dramatic, and tragic, an aerial shot of a giant monkey tumbling off the roof of a tall building, after a lingering shot of its dilating pupil, really is. `King Kong' doesn't exactly have chest-pounding bragging rights, but audiences will be more than happy to hear it proclaim its return to the big screen.	3.0	And The Monkey Proclaimed: O Drama	2005-12-25	3	1	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	The Groove	"Loud, expensive, computer-generated ""event"" movies do little for this viewer, but Peter Jackson's twenty-first century remake of the 1933 ""King Kong"" sets this movie apart from the rest of its peers. The 1933 classic had crude special effects and even a vaguely racist undercurrent, but Jackson's signature touch could very well make this ""Kong"" the definitive version. You know the story: a filmmaker desperate for a hit (Jack Black) recruits a struggling up-and-coming actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) to star in what he hopes will be his blockbuster smash movie. He tricks her and screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) into jumping on a ship to Skull Island where they badly clash with the natives who capture Ann and offer her as a sacrifice to Kong: an enormous 25-foot gorilla. Surprisingly, Kong bonds with Ann, while a frantic search is made to find her while fighting off dinasoars, abnormally large insects, and other creatures. Jackson piles on the action relentlessly, and the special effects are nothing short of thrilling. Kong himself, generated from computer graphics and modeled after actor Andy Serkis, looks amazingly real, quite unlike the cardboard image of the 1933 original. But while this version towers over the 1976 remake, a couple scenes aren't quite believable, such as the moment where the crew frantically races with a pack of dinasoars and end up unharmed. Sorry, I didn't buy it. Other than that, this ""Kong"" is very much worth your time.

They've really done something special here.Enough has been written here about the great things in KING KONG but I'll just add that I didn't care for Jack Black in the role of Carl Denham.  His desperation would've been more dramatic (and believable) with a more expierenced, older actor.And I thought Adrien Brody was so physically different from Black that it was distracting: I kept waiting for them to go into a ""Who's on First?"" routine.  Brody's hangdog expressions and his transformation from gawky New York playwright into Indiana Jones weren't believable either.Naomi Watts was great, hands-down.  She always delivers.(Now if today's Hollywood can give a brand new story the kind of innovation and energy that Jackson gives to KONG, maybe we'll have something new to cheer about.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AMLV3B3JDF4HD	The Kite	I am suprised to see so many positive reviews below! Like the rest, I waited in great anticipation for this film and wanted to like it so badly that I overlooked the first, oh, one or two hundred flaws, boredom spells, bad scripting and bad acting. But enough is enough, people. Perhaps Jackson's had one too many pats on the back for his near-perfect LOTR trilogy.Ok. So what went wrong?Like everyone else who dared to write a negative review, I must complain about the length. I think Jackson forgot that the reason his trilogy merited three hours a piece was because there was SOMETHING HAPPENING! In this, we have way too many extended close-ups of characters no one bothered to develop and therefore for whom we care very little - if at all. The Island scene left me completely exhausted. Every time they conquered one monster, cliff or maniacal tribe member, lo and behold, the camera turns and OH NO! yet another dreadful beast! Luckily, the people on the ship had been drinking their milk, eating their spinach, popping their steroids or otherwise brushing up on their superhuman powers. Nimbly they race under the feet of a dinasour stampede(thank gosh all the main characters made it!), they fall twenty feet, landing on their backs only to get up and ward off hundreds of inflated insects. They can swim, jump, wrestle and rock climb with the best of them. And good thing that Watts is made of plado or puddy or some other indestructable material - otherwise, her neck would have snapped with the first(of about twenty million) violent yanks from The Kongster.And while we are speaking of Miss Watts! I think Clinique or Avon funded a major portion of this movie, because at least 1/3 of it was devoted to Watts' always-well-made-up eyes. Yes, they are pretty. Yes, they express good emotion. But by golly we can only watch those big blue eyes water so many times!Which leads me to the acting. Unlike the other negative reviews(many of which were quite good and full of many solid points), I didn't think the acting was that bad. I felt like the direction made it very hard on the actors to do anything but what they did. Overact a little. Underdevelop their characters ALOT. Give meaningful stares that mean nothing. Etc. Adrien is great - I'm a fan of anything he does and he really did well for what he was given. Watts did alright, the sailors did alright. Colin Hanks was great to watch - I'm sure he hates to hear it, but he's a minature Tom. And Jack Black. Again, unlike the other negative reviewers, I thought he did a very good job switching to a slightly more serious role. He made me like him at the start, then slowly begin to disaprove of him, then subtley merge into a pretty solid hatred for his character. Nice job. However, the casts' attempt to lift the film was swallowed up by scenes that dragged forever, nonexistant dialogue, ornate sets and computer graphics, computer graphics and more computer graphics.Disapointing as this hyped up movie was, we must remember that Jackson really is pretty new on the scene. Should he have known better? Yes. Was he a little jacked up by his own image? Sure, but we're to blame because of our generous worshiping of his Ring. Are people still going to overlook this let down and make themselves love the movie for sake of a higher cause? Absolutely.But what can I say? Even though this movie doesn't half live up to what it promised to be, it was a decent action flick with too much running time. The graphics were great. The actors truly tried. And perhaps Jackson got that out of his system and will go back to making movies that stand above the rest... yeah right, whatever.So two stars.	2.0	King Kong: the eighth wonder of the world? Hardly.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A23HAGP3AQ6U7I	Thomas	Movie: After a somewhat awkward first act, the movie comes alive with excellent action, emotional and heartfelt, if ever-so-slightly flawed, storytelling, and a surprisingly dense thematic nature. 8/10.Video: Without any trace of DNR or edge-enhancement, this is one of the most lifelike transfers I've yet seen, with colors that are wonderfully saturated without being overdone, and perfect contrast--which at times may seem a tad high, but this is inherent to the source material, and not a flaw in the transfer. 10/10.Audio: As expected from a movie that won an Oscar for sound design, this DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio track is flawless. Every sound is completely--and I know I'm using this word a lot--lifelike, making excellent use of the surrounds, be it for subtle ambience or loud action-oriented effects. Music and dialogue are perfectly prioritized, never lost in the frenzy of wild action sequences. 10/10.Special Features: It's somewhat lacking in the special feature department. Ah, well. 5/10.Overall: An underrated action-drama is brought to life with wonderful clarity, via flawless 1080p video and DTS-HD MA audio.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"Not often enough, a film overflows with the director's enthusiasm and glee, jam-packed with action sequences, outstanding special effects, good and bad dialogue and acting, everything, good and bad, is just completely over the top. When I see a film like this, I can tell the filmmaker is really in love with his job, because they have crafted a film with such loving detail that everything they have is on the screen.Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" is such a film. After watching Merian C. Cooper's original 1933 ""King Kong"", Jackson decided he wanted to make films. He has, reportedly, wanted to do a remake for years, but was unable to get the funding. Then ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy became an international hit and his fortunes changed.What he has created is an eye-popping, excessive, overly long, thoroughly entertaining adventure film with some believable romance.As this is his lifelong dream project, Jackson has put everything into the film. Using the 1933 film as a template, the director and his team of screenwriters have fleshed out the back-story of the characters, giving us details of their life before they reach Skull Island, making them interesting, human and believable.Carl Denham (Jack Black) is a filmmaker with ideas and aspirations larger than his budget. The studio wants a B-picture about the jungle and Denham wants to film an epic masterpiece on an uncharted island located on a recently discovered map. Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) is a struggling vaudeville performer. Her theater closes unexpectedly leaving her on the cold streets of New York, hungry, with no paycheck. Denham needs a lead actress, spots Ann, takes her to dinner, and convinces her to star in his movie. That evening, she meets the screenwriter, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), more or less shanghaied by Denham. Ann greatly admires Driscoll's plays and would love to star in his newest production. When they arrive, Skull Island, a barren, rocky place, appears to be deserted, but the locals soon appear and believe Ann should be sacrificed to ""Kong"", the beast who rules beyond the giant wall the natives have built. Soon, Kong has taken Ann and the rest of the group trek through the strange island to get her back.At 187 minutes, ""Kong"" is a massive undertaking, both for filmmaker and audience. The extended length of time allows Jackson and his team to really explore the characters, helping the viewer get to know them before they arrive at the Island and all hell breaks loose. For instance, we learn the dire straits both Ann and Carl are in, prompting them to make this journey and this film. We learn why Jack, a respected playwright would become involved. All of this fleshes out the characters and helps them become more life like. When they are in danger, we care about their safety and the film becomes more memorable as a result.After ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, we expect the special effects work on ""Kong"" to be phenomenal. And it is. Later in the film, when we first see Kong, he takes our breath away. Extremely realistic in every aspect, he moves like an ape, reacts like an ape, and looks like a giant ape. If you have ever seen the 1933 film, Kong frequently changes size, in one scene he is 25 feet, later climbing up the Empire State building, he is 10 stories tall. Clearly, these special effects were advanced for the time, and the fact that they could create Kong at all is a miracle. But this wouldn't work in this day and age. Thankfully, with the advancement of special effects, ""Kong"" always looks the same size. He looks 25 feet tall when he first meets Ann and he looks 25 feet tall as he scales the Empire State Building.Just as the filmmakers have spent a lot of time fleshing out the humans, they also devote considerable screen time making Kong a real character. They give him feelings, emotions and a personality. Naturally, he is scary and intimidating, but the focus changes from terrorizing Ann to protecting her, becoming a scary adversary to all of the external forces that may appear to threaten her. In this film, we believe this change. He has believable facial expressions and interacts with the humans in natural, different ways. This may be the first time a CGI character has had a fully developed character arch. Andy Serkis, so memorable as Gollum in the ""LOTR"" trilogy, is largely responsible for making Kong a believable creature, giving the huge ape largely human characteristics. Simply great work.From the moment we first see 1933 New York, you realize you are in the hands of a master who loves to play with his toys. The city has a slightly romantic look, lights appear soft and glowing, snow rounds the hard edges, yet Jackson reminds us this is a city in the grips of the Depression. People are being evicted from their homes. The homeless have set up tent cities in the middle of Central Park. Theaters are closing. At times, the CGI backgrounds created for the film almost resemble the old fashioned painted backgrounds used in films of the 30s and 40s. I don't think this is a coincidence. I am sure Jackson did this as a homage to the films of this period.The entire sequence on Skull Island is filled with more special effects than any one of the ""Jurassic Park"" films. Kong battles some T-Rexes who want Ann for a tasty hors d'oeuvre, protecting her as he fights and rolls around with the dinosaurs. This sequence is what most filmmakers are striving for when someone describes an action sequence as ""a roller coaster ride"". Suprising, believable, exciting and wonderful. The rescue team has to deal with a brontosaurus stampede and, later,  insects so large you shoot them rather than swat them away. The brontosaurus stampede is equally eye popping and an equally diverting theme park attraction.Throughout, Jackson and his team have gone to great lengths to make every frame of celluloid believable, heightening the power of the film. Occasionally, they aren't quite successful. For instance, Kong's initial rampage through the jungle holding a screaming Ann, is not entirely convincing. The camera follows Ann, flopping back and forth, as Kong gallops through the jungle, revealing that she is clearly a computer creation. Even though these brief problems are distracting, they are also a little endearing, as though this might be another of Jackson's tributes to the original film. As much as I wish the graphics were completely believable throughout, I think the very brief lapses add a little charm to the film.All of the special effects work in the world will not solely create a great film. Jackson devotes a lot of time, as previously mentioned, building the back story of the human characters, making them believable, and he and partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, have crafted some great dialogue throughout adding yet another dimension to what easily could be just another briefly entertaining exercise in CGI. All of this work with characters, dialogue and back story has helped to ensure his ""Kong"" will be king.Naomi Watts more than holds her own when sharing screen time with a giant ape. And she does a good job with King Kong as well. Ann Darrow is a more fully realized heroine allowing Watts more to work with. Watts gives us a first hand look as we witness Ann's struggles as an actress, to live, and to eat. There are also subtle hints at her character throughout, making her more complex and interesting than we could expect.Adrian Brody is also very good as Jack Driscoll, a rising playwright. Caught on the boat as it leaves, he has no choice but to make the journey. Resigned, with nowhere else to go, he sets out to write the best screenplay possible. Then he meets Ann, and falls in love. She is equally smitten, but unwilling to make the first move. Unfortunately, Jack is unable to speak the words he wants to say, pouring his heart out on the page.I found the news Jack Black was cast in the film odd. Black's previous film work is filled with over the top starring roles in broad comedies. Nothing he has ever done would indicate he is capable of such a role in a film like this. Black's portrayal of Denham is interesting, over the top and inconsistent.Denham is an egotistical man, willing to put his film ahead of almost anything else, including the lives of a few crew members. As people in his crew are threatened, he secretly works with Preston (Colin Hanks), his assistant, to protect the film and their camera. When all hope of saving the film is lost, Denham comes up with Plan B. Black is able to adequately convey the inherent shiftiness in Denham's character, but at all times, there appears to be a joke or punch line bubbling below the surface, ready to break through. This makes the character seem less interesting, robbing Denham of some of the intensity he should have.Also, Black's performance doesn't have a lot of subtlety or nuance. When he realizes all chance of saving his film is lost, he shows little emotion except to stare at the exposed film. When he comes up with Plan B, to take Kong to New York, we don't see any part of his thinking, his planning, the moment when the idea pops into his head. This could be a result of Jackson's editing and direction, but Watts conveys a lot about her character whenever she is on screen, including having a relationship with a big ape. Black doesn't seem to view every moment of screen time as an opportunity to advance his character.Unfortunately, the occasionally corny dialogue, endearing in other actor's mouths, doesn't work well for Black. He doesn't have the skill to pull it off, making it occasionally sound like punch lines, eliciting laughs at the wrong time. Denham's famous last line loses all power because Black is unable to portray  the character's traits and pull it off. Thankfully, there is always enough going on around him to almost completely distract us from any problems with the character.At 187 minutes, ""Kong"" is a massive undertaking for the audience as well. Towards the end of the third hour, I began to wish Jackson had made two films. The first hour, as we learn about the humans, is fun and amusing. The second hour is action packed and builds a believable relationship between Ann and Kong. But this hour is so filled with amazing action that we are exhausted by the time it comes to a close. Then, when the film slows down, to reestablish New York and set-up the events for the climax, it begins to feel like we have been sitting for a long, long time. As the climax begins to build, things begin to move a bit, as Kong makes his way to the Empire State Building. In a way, Jackson is a victim of his own success; the third hour is unable to top the second. Don't get me wrong: ""Kong"" deserves each and every one of its 187 minutes, but it could also deserve each and every one of its 165 minutes and still be a truly exceptional film.Jackson's films just keep getting better and better. There are few filmmakers who could've handled the ""LOTR"" trilogy as well. With ""King Kong"", Jackson uses each and every skill, tool and artistic ability he has ever learned to create an eye-popping, excessive, overly long, thoroughly entertaining adventure film which will surely inspire a new crop of young men and women to become filmmakers.I can't wait to see what they create to interpret their lifelong dreams."	4.0	This Beast Is A Beauty.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2JP0URFHXP6DO	Tim Janson	"First let me say that I have always been a huge fan of the original King Kong.  Computer animation aside, what Willis O'Brien did with stop motion animation was one of the great technical achievements in movie history.  Like many I was certainly gun shy about another Kong remake after the disastrous 70's film and the even worse sequel.  But knowing Peter Jackson was at the helm eased my mind.  First and foremost Jackson is also a huge fan of the original and wasn't going to try and do anything that would disparage the film.  The first thing that Jackson does right is that he sets his film in the early 1930's, just like the original.  This is key in maintaining the atmosphere of the 30's theatre scene and the rickety ship the Venture.  It just doesn't work being set in modern times.Jack Black as Carl Denham also scared me as Black is none solely for his juvenile comedy films.  While he doesn't play it with the bravado of Robert Armstrong in the original, Black's slick, smarmy, do anything for a shot, works well for the most part.  Adrien Brody is Jack Driscoll, the playwright who basically finds himself shanghaied by Denham aboard the Venture to continue his screenplay.  Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow is really the star of the film.  While she doesn't have that famous Fay Wray scream, she handles the role as beauty to the beast with a beautiful romantic sensitivity.  I hope fans caught the in joke when Denham was looking for actresses for the role and said, ""What about Fay?""  His partner replies she's making a film for RKO and Denham snarls, ""Cooper!  I should have known!""  This of course refers to original Kong director Merian C. Cooper.If there's one weakness of the film it's not the length, but rather the length of time it takes to get to Skull Island.  Over an hour is spent building up the plot of Denham running off on his ship to make his movie, even after his financial backers want him to shut production down, and then making the long journey to the mysterious island.  Once we get to Skull Island the action takes off at a frenetic pace as the cast and crew are attacked by the savage natives until saved by the ship's Captain Englehorn and his crew.  Ann of course gets kidnapped by the villagers and taken as a sacrifice to Kong.  This leads to a chase by Driscoll, Denham, and the crew to rescue her.  Meanwhile Ann is winning over the beast by dancing and juggling and you will believe a giant gorilla can laugh.  While the battle with a handful of T-Rexes may have gone on a bit long, fans of the original couldn't help but be excited by Jackson inclusion of the Spider Pit sequence which was excised out of the original film.  In this scene, Driscoll, Denham, and other crew members fall into a ravine where they become pray to giant insects, man-eating slugs, and crab-clawed spiders.Ann is rescued and Kong is captured, all setting up the climactic escape from the theatre where Denham has put Kong on display, much to the disappointment of Ann and Jack who want no part of the spectacle, and the final battle atop the Empire State Building.  This third act seemed somewhat rushed though and I could have done with more time spent here and less on the opening.  I suspect, just like Lord of the Rings, that in a couple of months we will get an extended cut of the film with even more special features than what comes on the two disc set.  While this remake is not without a few weaknesses, it's still one of the best remakes of a classic film ever.

I'm talking about the scenes where Naomi Watts and King Kong are alone together - both on Skull Island and in Central Park - which just make up for the rest of the movie. Sure Adrian Brody and Jack Black are great (especially towards the end when Jack Black is in full Orson Welles mode) but this is Naomi Watts' movie.Also props for giving Andy Serkis a human character as well as the Kong movement.

No effort was required to suspend disbelief in this improbable character.  Kong himself was completely believable.Other special effects, however, were not handled with the same skill.  The scene with the dinosaur stampede, fighting the t-rexes while suspended in vines, and the scene in which one character shoots numerous large insects off of another character with a fully automatic carbine without injury to the other character were so implausible they nearly ruined a movie that could have been truly great.Jackson's special effects are so overdone, you never feel that the characters are in any real danger even amidst dinosaurs' gnashing teeth, rocks crumbling beneath their feet, or while clinging too the feet of giant bats.  In my opinion, Jackson got too carried away with his digital effects.	3.0	Could have been great, but way overdone	2006-04-09	11	5	6
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ALG7QH2L5JL2L	"T. Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series"""	"This movie wraps itself around you; all 3 hrs of it. There are a couple of parts where I wish the blanket were trimmed, but they fade into insignificance; at best they would have shaved off a few minutes. So, who cares?Why the 'wrapping' metaphor? Because this movie is all about that elusive story-element called 'pay off'. KK is a masterpiece, not only of re-telling a classic and archetypal tale of Beauty and Beast, but also of almost perfect closure of every foreshadowing-pay-off element in sight.It starts with the music. ""I'm sitting on top of the world"".... Has it ever sounded more sinister, ominous and bitterly satirical? Caged animals and food-lines. The dead giant surrounded by roaches-sorry, 'people'. Yes, here as well, with every line of the song, there's build-up that ultimately finds closure. Later the captain talks about roaches. The giant insects and leeches in the ravine. The milling crowds streaming into the theater. The milling crowds surrounding the fallen giant. Everything fits together. I watched it thrice and I've yet to find an event that didn't have closure. Even the interminable dino-stampede had a fore-shadowing purpose, but I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure it out.Jackson of course delights in overdoing his creatures; the appellation 'Giant Weta' suddenly assumed new meaning. Real 'Giant Wetas' can be quite sizable and look pretty intimidating; not for the faint-hearted. Jackson just took the name and ran with it. Masking the story-telling significance of the events by making it gruesome and quite scary. That's the way to do it. I don't know if Jackson is fully aware of what he did-sometimes these things are gut decisions, not necessarily cerebral-but whatever prompted him to make his directorial and editing decisions...it worked.The Beauty and the Beast. Here, too, is something that most other reviewers missed. Because it isn't a 'love'-story between human and simian at all. That's how it was sold to us, and everybody bought it; but it's so much more subtle and, dare I say it?, 'perceptive'. Those who see the story as the boy-girl thing between ape and girl will miss it altogether.The real 'love' story actually _is_ between Ann and Jack. He's the human analogue to the ape, the one who can be what the ape cannot-and who ultimately _is_ what he ought to be. The 'love' story between KK and Ann is more subtle-it is the tale of two creatures, from different worlds, who discover that beauty is...ahh, did you think I was going to say 'transcendent'? Well, possibly that's what Jackson intended to convey, but it could just as easily be understood as beauty simply everywhere, but until it is perceived it might as well not be. That, of course, is the essence of beauty: that it is indeed in the eye of the beholder, for 'beauty' is always 'beauty-perceived'; there is none other.KK is also about 'nobility'; something usually ignored or downgraded in its importance in most films made at the moment. The ape is savage, because he has to be in order to survive. Yielding to softer aspects of one's nature is lethal in that world; even apes can be brought down, in this instance by the closest thing to human existing in that island-enclosure, namely those gargoylish bats; on the mountain top, where KK, and others of his kind, appear to have gone before: the top of their world, whence they could watch beauty; the only kind available here, dimly understood, yet perceived: a sunset. Now KK takes the one other creature whom he has perceived as 'beautiful' to that same, dangerous place; but this time, while he is not killed himself by the sharp-toothed creatures tearing at him, it is by their agency that Ann is taken from him-and also by her human love, Jack, of course; with her, one must emphasize, complete collusion-he is lured to his final doom. Nobility battling it out with savage and basic instincts, urges, imperatives. Nobility wins; nobility instantiated in one's preparedness to protect that which one holds dear, for whatever reason, to any degree necessary. It's a fundamental animal urge; yet it is the one that allows even an animal to achieve nobility, dignity and purpose. The indictment of the human roaches-be they the, extremely un-PC, savages on Skull Island or the hyper-refined crowds going to see the 8th Wonder of the World-is all the more searing, because they appear to have no sense of it; and neither do they have even the tiniest shred of empathy for anything outside their own horizon.Ann's sentiments for the ape are more like 'compassion' than 'love'; understanding of the divided nature of that giant creature, on the human side of sentience in many ways, yet constrained to be something else because of what he is. Is there a better metaphor for humanity itself, and the eternal conflict between what we are and _need_ to be in order to survive and be 'human'; and yet there is that other thing that makes us want to be something 'other'-which we cannot be, individually or socially, because we would cease to be human. In the same vein KK is what he is, and he can only do what he does because he is that way. The paradox of our own existence.Jack is KK's human mirror-image, driven by the same instincts, but here they are constrained by his civilized upbringing. He is not a fighting machine, but a playwright-yet everything he does, shortly after meeting Ann, is essentially driven by the same motives as KK's: to protect her. He doesn't understand this at first; civilization and its essentially trivial accoutrements prevent him from seeing that which truly matters to him. But in the end, after the ape has fallen to his death, he's at the top of the Empire State Building with her.So, you see, the story isn't as simple as some would have it. Some humans come off very badly-especially those who have lost sight of the things that matter, and who become immersed in trivial self-importance and the gazillion meaningless pursuits offered by society to those who need them. But not all have lost perspective and others find it. The ape overall exhibits more nobility than most humans though. This is not so much anthropomorphization of the ape, but an indictment of the insectization of humans.KK is not just a good movie, but a great one; done with obvious affection for the genre and the story-with more depth and dimensions than either of its predecessors; more than I had expected or even dared hope for.Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNA"	5.0	Wraps itself around you like an embrace.	2006-03-08	13	8	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2XUW4IZP6UPDL	To Be Simple	Peter Jackson is a talented filmmaker and I was excited to delve into this extended edition of King Kong. Unfortunately, this film has been overhyped and falls flat when all is said and done. There is no doubt that some of the action scenes are outstanding and the cinematography is nice. What brings the film down is the fact that it is needlessly long. The first hour is boring at times and could have been easily condensed. While the action scenes are done well, they sometimes drag on to the point they are not as exciting as they should have been. By the end of the film I was honestly hoping the film would just end.	2.0	Falls flat	2007-01-12	4	1	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ	Todd7	At 188 minutes, this version of the 1933 classic movie is good for the most part. Though Kong doesn't appear until an hour and ten minutes into the film, the viewer isn't getting restless, because they know that he will be the focus of the remainder of the film. This movie starts a bit slow (obviously), but the first hour isn't exactly wasted, as time is spent on character development, especially with Ann Darrow. We're taken into her world as an actress, and how she's pursued for her role. Naomi Watts does a superb job as Ann, and her compassion for Kong is heartfelt and real. If this movie has some weak spots, it's simply the length of it, along with too much emphasis on CGI capabilities. Some of the CGI sequences are over the top, and to the point of not looking real, whether it be too many closeups, too much ground-level stuff, or unusual athletic ability. Certain sequences are wonderful, such as the T Rex fight, and Kong's rampage through the city streets. All in all, this film is still good, and kept my attention throughout. However, I needed a break after the first half; it seems to work well that way.	4.0	King Long	2011-11-17	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A176IA89VGH46M	Todd Bovair	..but perhaps I am setting my standards too high. After the FANTASTIC Lord Of The Rings movies, I guess I figured Peter Jackson could do no wrong. And make no mistake, his King Kong remake is not a bad movie at all... but it certainly isn't great.Part of the problem is the original. The original's storyline seems too perfect in comparison. Whenever Jackson's film deviated from the original's storyline, I found myself thinking that the remake was a weaker film storywise because of it. And its not just because I like the original, the 1976 Jessica Lang remake deviated from the original, and it actually had some improved moments (although the 1976 version is not a very good movie over all).A major complaint I have with Jackson's film is it is TOO LONG. Not that 3+ hours is too long, but when 40 minutes of the film is absolutely NOTHING but padding, just meaningless FLUFF, what's the point of having it in the movie? Obviously, Jackson was wallowing in his joy at getting to make his King Kong, and all that padding seriously effects the flow of the movie. Had 40 minutes been trimmed, the film would be better.I also must say there is FAR too much emphasis on the effects in this film. There is a particular sequence involving stampeding dinosaurs which was WAY too long, rather stupid, and apparently was included just so Jackson could say 'Look what we can do!'. A very weak and pointless sequence in the movie. In addition, the fight scenes that Kong is involved in are REALLY unrealistic and badly choreographed.A further complaint (although this one is minor), is that Kong's first appearance onscreen has no suspense buildup, no shock value to seeing this HUGE gorilla. The 1976 version did a great job with this, and I guess I expected at least as good a moment from Peter Jackson. Also, the ending wasn't handled all that greatly, athough it was passable. Jack Black's delivery of the famous last line in the movie was TERRIBLE however, and way off base.Well, that's enough complaining, here are some good things about the movie! Kong looks great in the film, although it does take some getting used to. After all, THIS Kong looks like a REAL gorilla, not a man in a monkey suit like all previous Kongs.The acting is generally very good, and the sets look fantastic (the minimalist Skull Island looks exactly like you can imagine it would if it existed in the real world). There are some truly touching moments in this film between Naomi Watts and Kong- hard to believe from a CGI gorilla, but its true. Finally, the story stays quite true to the classic original, which is a good thing.All in all, Peter Jackson's remake is a good film, but I really expected more. With all the time and money spent on this, plus the considerable talents of Jackson and his crew, I expected a movie on the level of Lord Of The Rings. Sadly this was not the case. While I recommend everyone see Jackson's film just because of the enormity of the project, don't view it with expectations of exceeding the original- you will most likely be VERY disappointed (like I was). I think I'll stick with the original Kong.	3.0	I expected a masterpiece....	2006-04-27	8	6	2

Guess what ? Peter Jackson , does/did .Well...I thinkith this movie stinkiths. Twas beauty killed the beast ? Gimmie a break. It's the producers who keep killing this story by trying to reinvent it. Firstly , the characters are boring and the casting is unbelievably attrocious. Albiet Jack Black and Niomi Watts retain a sence of interest...the rest of the cast could be easilly replaced by the original members of that 70's show "" CHiPs"". I wouldn't have noticed a thing. The best thing going for this film , is the special effects. King Kong in his natural habitat is a scene to behold. Especially when he's in action. It's just too bad that it's 2 hrs. into the second act , before we get to see him. JAckson makes good use of the 8th wonder , by maximizing the time we spend with the monkey. I truly began to feel a strange sense of compassion for King Kong. Unfortunately we had to go back to the supporting characters and my interest wained. I think King Kong will be great for kids between the ages of 3 and 15. Beyond that , you should either watch the original or the Jessica Lange/ Jeff Bridges version. Even , Mighty Joe Young. But if you're looking for an action packed blockbuster film...Tis ain't the one. Twas beauty killed the beast ? I think not.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A233QN6P2EEKPS	Tom Collier	"Peter Jackson's King Kong is an marvelous achievement that carries astonishing clarity and vision within every frame. 2005 was a year that saw cinematic masterpieces such as Capote and Munich, but King Kong successfully embodies and often elevates to a new level the elements of storytelling, action, and visual effects that made cinema emerge as the 20th century's premier art form.King Kong seizes on the story provided by the 1933 original and expands upon it in the way some great films bring novels to a vibrant life no one could have imagined the material was capable of. Taking place during the Great Depression, we meet Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a struggling actress and performer. She has a good heart, but her life has been little more than a series of crippling disappointments. In a seemingly divine stroke of luck, movie producer Carl Denham (Jack Black) approaches Ann on the street, offering her the chance to star in one of his films. Unbeknownst to her, Denham's plans are to travel the Pacific in search of a mysterious island, misleading both film and ship crews to get there.The voyage to Skull Island receives most of the first hour of screen time, but never does it become tedious. Jackson's characters are likeable and clear, the dialogue never attempting to be clever or flashy, but a perfect component to lay out the action ahead. Already a good film, the film rushes forward at breakneck pace upon reaching Skull Island, never missing a step or skipping a beat. Skull Island may be the most malevolent location ever put to film, replete with vile monsters that could each serve as their own horror series.When King Kong (Andy Sekris) finally arrives, he occupies the screen with a dazzling sense of power and flawless movement.  Sekris, who did the fabulous movements of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, works with special effects to bring the giant ape to life in way that outshines that of most human actors.Outwardly vicious and intimidating, Kong grows attached to Ann. She performs her vaudeville act for Kong, an enthusiastic audience who may not have ever received kind attention from another being. We slowly realize the two share a sort of connection that goes deeper than words. Both are outcasts in their societies, living solitary existences defined primarily by their physical traits. Kong protects Ann from the appalling creatures on Skull Island, and after the humans capture the great beast, Ann tries to protect him.The knockout action sequences come furiously during the film's latter 2/3's, utilizing state of the art f/x and imagination for all they are worth. During one breathtaking sequence, Kong battles three tyrannosaurs rex's while holding Ann in alternating hands, while in another terrifying sequence, the film crew comes under assault from thousands of disgusting insects. Each sequence would likely be the highlight of the average film, but when Kong runs amok in New York City, the exhilarating payoff never falls short of awe-inspiring.Peter Jackson has come a long way. Originally known as the director of cult horror schlock such as Dead Alive, he shot to worldwide fame as the driving force behind the superb Lord of the Rings films. With King Kong, he proves himself to be an artist with phenomenal potential to add his name to the lexicon of great filmmakers.When Kong brings Ann to the stop of the Empire State building, he looks longingly at her, his deepest sadness being that their time together has run out, and I tearfully felt the same way. Roger Ebert often states ""No bad film is short enough, while no good film is long enough."" These words rang true throughout my psyche as this exciting, wonderful, deeply sad, and beautiful film came to a close."	5.0	Amazing adventure film raises the bar	2006-03-30	1	1	0

The movie has few good points and unfortunately three times as many bad points.The GOODThe CG King Kong & various creatures- most were very realistic, but not all of them but not all the time. Ocasionally there were times when they were not believable.The look of the film- Recreation of NY was spectacularThe BAD- Movie is 90 minutes to long. What took a minute in original movie takes 10 minutes here. The extra minutes did nothing to enhance story/plot lines or develope the characters.The acting - Uniformally terrible, especially Black. When the best performance in a film is by a special effect (Kong) you have serious problems.Story/Plot lines - How a group of people being chased in a 3 foot revine by a dozen dinosaurs and not getting trampled to death is not believable or Anne being shaken and stirred about 1000 times when Kong is running and holding her , well loic doe's not rule here.This movie is a MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT. You would be better off buying the new 2 DVD release of the original. The second DVD of extras is worth it. The ironic thing is the inclusion of the recreation of The Pit Sceen by Jackson which is infinity better than this new version of KING KONG.Sorry to bring you down.	2.0	High Expectations.......Low Results	2005-12-17	18	8	10

Stick with the original - the effects may be primative, but they served a real purpose. And where the characters actually evoked real relationships with each other. The cardboard acting between Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts was stupendous in its lack of chemistry. Then there was the scene between Kong and Watts in which her character suddenly bursts into such a wide array of...heck, I still can't figure it out. But is certainly was embarrassing.It is a sad day when the the best actor in the movie was the animation of Kong. Without a doubt this was top notch. I truly felt sorry when Kong finally slipped away at the end. (Fans of Cameron's Titanic might remember how DiCaprio's character finally slipped away into the void, and Kong's last breath was not only reminiscent of that but seemed to have been stolen from it.) But even Kong's heroic acting ability, down to the very end, was decimated by Jackson's inability to keep excess in check.I'm amazed that a director who actually believes he was born to direct King Kong could do the story such a major disservice...I liked the Lord of the Rings trilogy...I had been hoping Kong would demonstrate an ability to trim some of the tendency to excess from those movies, but it was not to be. It wasn't Kong that really went off the deep end in the end - it was Jackson all along.	1.0	Wretched Excess	2006-04-02	21	11	10

Peter Jackson's visual effects team really did a phenomenal job with that and there aren't many moments where you really don't believe a 30 foot ape is actually on set or on stage.That's really about the only good thing I can say about this, though.This movie reminds me a lot of the Star Wars prequels in that, it seems, many of the effects (which is essentially the last 2 hours of the movie) are on screen to show the world, ""hey, look what we can do!""  There are scenes that don't even make sense in the actual plotline of the feature and add zero relevance to anything in the story other than showboating (the dinosaur stampede had me throwing my arms up on the couch shouting, ""Why???"").I'll give Naomi Watts a bit of credit because I would imagine it's hard to act when you're standing in front of a green screen alone for most of the shoot.  She did a relatively convincing job, but everyone else on the screen is pretty bad, here.  Jack Black is awful and does nothing but make contorted faces when he gives his lines.  There's a strange relationship between two ship-men (a former soldier and Tom Hanks' kid) that makes zero sense.  The former soldier preaches to this kid the entire time they're on screen as if it's supposed to mean something.  Adrian Brody jogs with prehistoric animals and large apes as if it's the most natural thing in the world, as if he grew up in Queens with dinosaurs as pals or household pets.That's a big problem with 'King Kong'.  These people are thrown into extraordinary circumstances and they wander aimlessly through the scenes as though they're everyday occurrences (notice jack Black just hanging out and spinning his camera while mayhem is going on all around him).The first hour is a complete bore.  When the movie picks up it isn't much more than a special effects extravaganza.  it would have been nice if there was something...anything here to go along with those effects.However, Peter Jackson obviously suckered millions upon millions out of admittance prices, so what does he care, really?"	2.0	Qualifies As A Rent But Don't Buy	2006-04-14	13	7	6

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A220FJEQNGMSRN	Trevor Willsmer	"Viewed on the small screen, last year's King Kong is a bit more of a problematic experience than it was on the big screen, being at once a mixture of the best and worst of Peter Jackson. His love of and sheer joy in film-making is manifestly obvious right from the delirious opening montage of Depression era New York that gives the background detail a modern audience wouldn't bring into the theatre with them as they did in 1933 with a wonderful visual economy so much of the rest of the film lacks. Unfortunately he then spends a couple of reels detailing the death of Vaudeville and Carl Denham's problems with studio execs. And then a couple of reels on getting under way. And then far too many reels sailing to Skull Island - when Denham promised Ann a long ocean voyage, he wasn't kidding. It's not so much that they're bad scenes (though some are quite weak), more that there's no reason for all of them to be there. Most could have easily been thrown over the side with the rest of the ship's fittings, but instead they tend to bury the more portentous moments under trivia. Indeed, it's interesting to note that a draft of Jackson's aborted attempt to film it in 1998 included none of this section whatever, kicking off with the Venture piercing the fog in search of Skull Island.But once it literally crashes into Skull Island, the film really takes off - the natives this time really are savage, almost Neolithic, the action scenes well-handled and the pace relentless. Jackson even manages to top several sequences from the original - the Bride of Kong sacrifice, Kong escaping from the Broadway theatre, the Empire State Building finale, here a breathtakingly dizzying piece of filmmaking - as well as throwing in some good additions of his own, such as a truly charming scene on the ice in Central Park or a couple of convincing storm sequences on the perilous shores of Skull Island. There are plenty of fun injokes that don't seem awkwardly forced on the picture either - Denham tries to get Fay Wray for the lead in his picture, but she's making a film for Merian C. Cooper at RKO; the scene they shoot on the boat is one from the 1933 film; Rick Baker, the man inside the suit in 1976, is one of the pilots gunning down Kong; and the interpolation of much of Max Steiner's score offers some nice musical nods even if the ""Walla Walla Kong Kong!"" lyrics are omitted.There's more that's good than bad about the film by a long way, but the bad is bad enough to keep this from becoming an all-time classic in its own rightThere's some striking miscasting. Much as he looks like Orson Welles in certain shots, Jack Black really isn't up to Carl Denham, a part Oliver Platt or Vincent D'Onfrio could have dome in their sleep: too often he looks like he's telling a joke that's fallen flat rather than delivering dramatic dialog, and there's that air of trying too hard that follows him around like a bad smell. Naomi Watts is surprisingly anodyne and not terribly flatteringly photographed (to put it mildly), reminding me why, despite some good work in the past, she remains so resolutely unmemorable an actress. Kyle Chandler hams it up fairly charmlessly as her nominal leading man, telegraphing the jokes to such a degree that they're more irritating distractions than genuine comic relief. Adrien Brody's unlikely hero fares better despite having nothing much to do in the last act, while the smaller roles fare better, with Thomas Kretschmann's Engelhorn, Evan Parke's Hayes and Jamie Bell's cabin boy all making their mark before being unceremoniously discarded.But the acting honors easily belong to Andy Serkis' Kong, a triumph not just of CGI (and far more convincing than he appeared in the trailers) but also performance. It's not merely that this Kong is more facially expressive - he's caught the body language perfectly, convincing us that it's a great ape rather than a human being dictating the moves. It makes the same mistake as the 1976 version in having Ann feel empathy with Kong which, while better executed here, lessens the tragedy of Kong - the fact his devotion was unrequited was one of the things that made his last stand so much more touching and pitiful.Elsewhere, the effects are variable and too often Jackson throws in an FX shot just because he likes the idea - not so much a problem with the beasties but definitely tiresome when we get to yet another CGI shot of the ship at sea. Nor are all of the effects quite state of the art. The problem is the old one with CGI - poor integration of the live action and computer generated footage, both of which all too often seem to be shot at visibly different resolutions (particularly noticeable in the stampede sequence). Yet compared to the two previous remakes, Jackson's genuine love of the material still carries the day and certainly delivers the best of 2005's blockbusters."	5.0	Despite its flaws, the best blockbuster of 2005	2006-06-12	1	1	0

Only if it has an Intermission-So that we can go the bathroom, Get Popcorn, Drinks and Some Candy, and then come on back for the rest of the show. Peter Jackson (The LOTR Trilogy) wants this film to stay true to the 1933 version, instead of the 1976 Re-Make. While in New York, Kong had to defend those red baron planes while staying on top of The Empire State Building. In 1933, Kong stayed on top of  The Chrysler Building, and in 1976, It was the towers of The World Trade Center, where Kong was perched. I think Jack Black has done a wonderful job playing seriously-minded film director Carl Denham.

Two small questions to the director and the screen writer(s) :  How could Ann Darrow survive the entire story without any significant injury, like, say, a broken spine or neck?  And how could Jack survive the rescue attempt by Jimmy the cabin boy, who never before in his life fire a gun, doing exactly that with his eyes closed even?So, the quote I can think of is by Carl Denham, the director by Jack Black, goes somewhere along the line of : ""You can see the eighth wonder and a piece of the uncharted corner of the world all for the price of an admission ticket.""Yeah, right.  Whatever.Aside from the weird and impossible stunts and special effects, the movie was average.  My vote for the best actor/actress in this movie goes to King Kong.  I know, he's made up, not real and such, but believe me, I enjoyed his presence on the big screen more than any other actor/actress.All in all, go and see it if you want to see Naomi Watts' big blue eyes swimming in tears, the rugged and handsome captain of the Venture or the cute cabin boy, Jimmy.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	Peter Jackson's new version of `King Kong' is twice as long as the first version made in 1933. The basic story about the doomed beast and the beauty remains intact. Jackson infused more actions into the familiar story, but most impressive thing about this 3 hour 8 minute film is the tender and quite moments, in which King Kong and Ann Darrow are sitting side by side as if a scene from `The Beauty and the Beast.'[BRILLIANT OPENING IN NEW YORK] We don't need to repeat this enormously popular tale here. Jackson wisely set the story in 1933, the same year when the original was released, and in the opening section Jackson sets up the film's period tone brilliantly with the scenes from New York City re-created by CGI. Here the central characters struggling stage actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts, perfect) and unscrupulous movie director Carl Denham (Jack Black) are given time to explain their background. The first chapter is perhaps better than the rest of the film as far as its dramatic power goes. I mean, of course, dramas among humans.I said this because the special effects of Kong and the dinosaurs replacing the Willis H. O'Brien's still imaginative stop motion animations are at first stunning, but the extended chases and battles between humans and creatures (or creatures and creatures) get less and less exciting as the story unfolds. Actually, the story doesn't unfold much in the Skull Island where the ship's crew meets the Eighth Wonder of the World because Jackson gives one too many action here while we know how the battle ends before it starts.[ALMOST PERFECT] The film is not boring, and I would have given perfect 5 stars if only Jackson hadn't done two necessary steps. One is the lengthy middle part as I said above, and the other is very unimaginative, clich&eacute;d descriptions of the `natives' of the Skull Island. Jackson committed another typical mistake of making the islanders inexplicably hostile tribes while he doesn't need it. One of the merits of the Merian C. Cooper's direction in the original is that his descriptions of the tribesmen were stereotyped, but never negative ones. In this respect Jackson's `King Kong' looks like a throwback to the old Hollywood films Carl Denham himself might be shooting.Ignore these flaws, and enjoy `King Kong' as a grand-scale entertainment.	4.0	Almost Perfect Grand-Scale Entertainment	2006-02-08	5	3	2

Ironically it was the box office pounding of THE FRIGHTENERS that allowed Jackson to make KING KONG: he was supposed to have made KING KONG after THE FRIGHTENERS, but since it did so bad, the studio said no. So, instead, Jackson did the incredible and made THE LORD OF THE RINGS instead, guaranteeing him that he would be able to make any movie he would ever want. Thus, Jackson's version of KING KONG was finally made.The plot goes something like this. Slimy filmmaker and showman Carl Denham gets into some trouble. To escape it and to make the movie of his dreams (catch Jackson's own self-mockery here) he hires a ship to take him to a mysterious island that only he has a map to: Skull Island. Sailors have long told stories about this mysterious island, but common folk have disregarded such talk as that of a drunk or mad man. But, Denham believes and sure enough, his belief leads his ship to Skull Island. There they find a somewhat cannibalistic group of islanders who kidnap the only female on the ship, Ann Darrow, and offer her up to their god, the gigantic gorilla King Kong. Kong takes their offering, but instead of destroying it, becomes fascinated by Darrow. In fact, Darrow's beauty enchants the great ape.But Kong isn't the only one who has fallen for Darrow's charms. Jack Driscoll is a semi-famous author who fell in love with Darrow during their trip at sea. Risking everything, Driscoll ventures deep into the jungle to rescue Ann and bring her back home. But Kong won't be separated from his person of affection and chases Driscoll. However, a trap has been set and Kong becomes trapped.He's then brought to New York and put on display. But Kong isn't a beast that can be tamed easily. He escapes his chained existence and finds the girl of his dreams. Unaccustomed to the urban jungle, Kong climbs to the one place he feels most at home--on top of the city's highest building. There he enjoys a few moments of peace with Darrow, before he faces off with a squadron of airplanes.KING KONG is a very impressive movie. Jackson does an extraordinary job of re-creating 1930s New York and to remaining faithful to the original spirit of the first KING KONG. However, at the same time he does so much more. Jackson's version of KING KONG does everything from turn a &#34;B&#34; movie into an &#34;A&#34; film to illustrate the class system that is developing in America, to satirize the extreme materialism and consumerism of our modern culture, to re-establish the classic everyman (Jack Driscoll as played by Adrian Brody) as a potential hero. The movie works on so many levels and has so much to say. At the same time, it is just a great movie.The film is a bit too long and the whole insect thing could have been cut (Even though it might be crucial to the Dante-esque journey Jackson was trying to display). Nevertheless, KING KONG is everything movies were meant to be. I wouldn't doubt that if 30 years from now another brilliant director comes along and says, &#34;When I saw Peter Jackson's KING KONG, I knew I wanted to make movies.&#34;	5.0	Kong Is King	2006-01-12	1	1	0

Either way I didnt want to point out whether or not I like the movies storyline, there are plenty of dvd reviews for that.But I do want to leave my recommendations for this as an HD DVD. This is by far one of the best looking HD DVDs available so far. This goes way beyond the picture quality of the DVD version. The images are brilliant and jump off the screen at you.It is amazing that a movie over 3 hours long with a picture resolution of twice that of a regular dvd now fits on a single disk.If you have an HD DVD player and want to be impressed with its picture quality this one is a must have for your collection.	5.0	KONG IS KING	2006-11-19	5	5	0

And ""King Kong"" is not exactly a literary classic. There are some nice special effects but the ape/girl thing is hard to swallow and somehow the movie comes off a bit anti-septic and clinical.The old original at least had some ""atmosphere"" (albeit with dodgy special effects).I think LOTR has jaded me.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ALVBPAGHQJDYK	Tyler	"Let me begin by telling you my dislike for Peter Jackson coming into Kong. After LOTR (a better book, excellent films though as well) the fans and media turned me off on the series to a large degree. So I went into Kong with my girlfriend with almost a gruge against Peter Jackson, I wanted him to fail. Anyone living before this movie would know the press built Peter Jackson up to be untouchable, a god. Anyways, to what we are all here for the film review. With all this in mind I came out upset at myself, for I like so many others had become enchanted with the ""magic"" Jackson is capable of creating. The movie which has been re created more times than I care to think about brings life to this old story. I left the theater enchanted and still have those sentiments months later. I remember seeing the previews and thinking ""how stupid"" another King Kong, bravo Mr. Jackson very original. Well, I was wrong. King Kong really didn't even intrest me (i went because of my g/f) I always thought the idea of a huge gorilla parading around Manhattan was silly and downright ridiculous. However, when I left the theater I had all those emotions one gets who likes this film (happy, scared, sad, hate) and to this day, months later, I still hold the same sentiments. Do yourself a favor and at least rent this movie."	5.0	Surprisingly I loved it	2006-04-07	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AYQF4Z1EQDACU	Tyler Reece	"Peter Jackson beautifully & triumphfantly delivers ""the Eighth Wonder of the World"" in a visually stunning and more heart breakingly 3 hour epic. I new all along like this being the film, Jackson had been wanting to remake, I believe this is the film I was born to see. I got to see a version of Merian C. Cooper's beast from the man who directed ""the Lord of the Rings"" The visual effects, are amazing, the emotion is more tender than the original. It pays homage to the original and it outdoes it no doubt. Jack Black came through in a serious role, Naomi Watts & Adrien Brody were marvelous. This masterpiece most definitley should have been Best Picture, but the Academy usually doesn't go for fantasy epics except ""the Lord of the Rings"" but at least it won three oscars including best visual effects. Thats the best movie I've ever seen, but truly I think it is. A great director shares in his passion a fantastic story whom he brings for a generation who couldn't sit through a black & white movies, I can & I own the King Kong collection, I excited for the extended edition DVD of Kong, just like ""the Lord of the Rings"". I think it would awesome if Peter Jackson remade ""Son of Kong"" although it's only this ""King Kong"" that made him become a director. This a masterpiece of something of beautiful in 1933, that could be again today. It sends you to another time & strange place. Everybody get out to see the latest and greatest edition to the ape's movie changing legacy and the greatest edition to the movies itself. So hold your breath for most thrilling and most romantic fantasy Hollywood has ever known. The Essence of why movies are made.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A9AX4DZFV556F	Tyler T. Kutz	King Kong is Peter Jackson's first movie since completing The Lord of the rings trilogy.  Once again Jackson proves himself as a master of filmmaking.  While not as epic, or as good, as the Lord of the Rings, King Kong certainly is a masterpiece.  Some have argued that this movie is driven by little other than it's special effects.  The special effects are astounding, and plentiful, but there's no question that this is a character-driven film.  A considerably large portion of the three-hour movie is used to establish the characters, during which time we see neither Skull Island or the great primate himself.My favorite things about the movie: Naomi Watts, James Newton Howard's score, and the action hero Bruce Baxter (played by the guy from the TV show Early Edition).  Jack Black is PERFECT as the obsessed filmmaker.Also I liked the ending, where Jackson portrays neither King Kong nor the pilots that shoot him down as evil.  We sympathize with King Kong yet realize the necessity of killing the beast.  The long running time can be a turn-off for repeated viewing, but if its the first time you will not be bored.	5.0	Jackson does it again	2008-05-11	1	1	0

King Kong and the dinosaurs look so cool!! Peter Jackson's love for the mighty gorilla made him make a remake of the 1933 film. This movie has the same idea that the 1933 version did. This movie just is a lot scarier and more violent. Jack Black (Carl Denham) is hillarios in this film. This is a lot better than a Godzilla fan. By the way, King Kong easily creamed the oversized lizard (Godzilla). Even though I love Godzilla, King Kong is a lot cooler, and a lot better.	5.0	I wish I could give it a billion stars!!!!!!	2005-12-31	3	1	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2M377P9ZS32Q	uhardeman	"okay flick.  the action was pretty cool but with this type of flick its obvious that it's all fake so the awe for me is wondering how the filmakers pulled this stuff off.  the bigger and louder the effects and action sequences got, the more detatched i got from them cuz we all know that it's smoke and mirrors.  that said, the bit where the dinosaurs run down the gully and then trip and fall over each other - and the actors trying not to get squished - that was very cool.my major complaint:  the characterizations of the players didn't work for me.  why did they play the captain as dark, mysterious and scary?  for that matter, why was he suprised to find the chloroform on the ship? it's his ship! where did Jimmy come from?  why was he supposedly ""more wild than half the animals down here""?  was he from skull island? offspring of some unholy union with one the the natives?  And Jack Black's Denham:  was he the comic relief?  was he the villain?  after all, he's the one who kept trying to make the movie no matter how many crewmembers were eaten, squashed, or mutilated by natives!  By the end of the flick we're meant to root for kong, and Denham is the one who ultimately is responsible for getting kong killed.. and he (denham) lives and in fact has the last line in the flick.  i don't get it.  The only relationship that made any sense to me in this flick is that of Kong and Anne.and what was with all the sweeping swooping camera moves?  remember when Driscall types 'Skull Island' onto his typewriter and the camera goes all wonky.. wha?  the more i think about it the more this film reeks.  but whatever.  Thank god there was no 'I love you' seen between Anne and Kong'and the bit on the ice skating rink?  Not Good."	3.0	well the savages were pretty cool	2006-05-02	6	3	3

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AL2051P2ILW8A	"Valdez is here ""OLD MOVIE SNOB"""	The original movie had a great musical score.  This movie does not.  I can't remember a single song after watching it.  It's a shame that movies aren't scored well anymore.  What happened to music that was composed with full orchestras in mind?Aside from that I didn't like the part of Ann defending the Ape.  It seemed too pro-ecology and politically correct for the 1930's.  America was not politically correct in the 1930's or in the original movie.  Let's keep it that way in the remake.  There should of been more of an attraction between Driscol and Ann.  He should of married her and had Kong steal her against her will.  The part of Ann dancing for Kong was stupid it reminded me of the hideous 1970's version.Denham should of been more likeable.  He seemed like such a rascal.The special effects were great, but come on 3 t-rexs.  Less is more should be the key to this movie.  The plot development leading to Skull island was way to long. Another thing this movie did not do was make it suspenseful when they are going through the island.  The original had you on the edge of your seat.  What were they going to see next?Ann trying to rescue the ape at the empire state building was stupid and also reminded me of the hideous 1970's version.The remake could of been a lot worse.  At least Peter Jackson did a much better job than the remake of 30 years ago.  If some one else had remade it could of been alot worse.	3.0	THE ORIGINAL WAS BETTER	2006-03-31	4	0	4

Perhaps I am too young to see it that way. But at least I have seen the movie, on more than 1 occassion. Anyway, I love Peter Jackson and I loved this film. Yes, it was a tad overlong but I dont mind long movies as long as they keep my interest. The effects and acting were wonderful and amazing. Peter Jackson and his Weta team are genuises in that department. In this, I actually felt sypathy when King died, as opposed to the original where I felt nothing. Naomi Watts is quickly becoming my favorite actress. She can truly do anything. Kong Himself was by far some of the best effects in film history. There is no way anybody can complain about that. I saw it in the theaters and it was an awesome experience. That is probably the best way to see this, on a very big screen.	5.0	Pretty exciting movie	2007-08-23	2	1	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1NTXJPTFP1G03	"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian"""	"You would think after making the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy--surely the most gargantuan undertaking in Hollywood history--that Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson could be relied upon to produce a superior remake of the legendary, 101-minute classic adventure movie ""King Kong"" (1933) than director John Guillerman's 135 minute, modern-day ""King Kong"" (1976) remake. Sadly, what should have happened does not! ""King Kong"" (no stars out of ****) the third time around amounts to the biggest pile of monkey shines since the hilariously outrageous Kong parody ""The Mighty Gorga"" (1969) with Anthony Eisley. Although Universal Studios will undoubtedly recoup their bucks from this blatantly bad banana peel of a movie, they will have to keep their public relations people scurrying like baboons 24/7 to ensure that this time-consuming 3-hour & 7-minute, $300 million slip-up turns a profit. Indeed, Jackson retains the Depression-Era setting of the original, but he wastes at least 90 minutes on stuff that could have been cut without harming the dramatic impact. Worse, the remake does not fix lapses in credibility that the original ""King Kong"" got away with because audiences in the 1930s were not as savvy as today's moviegoers. Transporting King Kong from Skull Island back to New York was the chief problem that the movie ignored. In the modern-day ""King Kong,"" the oil company locked the giant ape up inside a supertanker and shipped him back to New York. Essentially, the story remains the same: a band of adventurers take a tramp steamer to an uncharted island. They discover primitive islanders who sacrifice virgins to a humongous 25 foot ape. When the islanders catch a glimpse of the nubile white maiden among the while men, they kidnap her, offer her as a sacrifice to King Kong, and our heroes plunge into the interior to rescue her.Basically, Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" collapses under the weight of too many characters, too much plot, and second-rate special effects. Not only do the actors clearly appear green-screened into scenes featuring stampeding dinosaurs and elaborate miniature sets (the integration of live actors with artificial footage is far from seamless), but also the special effects background shots resemble those cheap, paint-by-the-numbers, watercolor kits. While Guillerman's ""King Kong"" (that starred Jeff Bridges and launched Jessica Lange to stardom) took a critical drubbing, it stands head and shoulders above Jackson's ape-solutely awful rehash. Even the campy Japanese movies: ""King Kong Vs. Godzilla"" (1963) and ""King Kong Escapes"" (1967) are more entertaining. Surprisingly, despite several scenes of intense violence, the Motion Picture Association of America gave the new ""King Kong"" a family friendly PG-13 rating. Mind you, adolescent boys have always loved dinosaurs duking it out. Nevertheless, one scene teems with antennae-twitching, creepy-crawlers that would send anybody off on a super bug-spray shopping spree. The most reviling scene in this mind-numbing marathon of mediocrity occurs when enormous earthworms attack a sailor. These long slimy, egg-roll brown mutants sprout large bubble-gum pink heads wreathed with razor-sharp white fangs. In a graphic long shot, one icky earthworm attaches itself to the head of a man and sucks him up inside its mouth. Nothing like this happened in either the original ""King Kong"" or the 1976 modern-day remake and its 1986 sequel ""King Kong Lives.""Jackson and co-scenarists Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy violate the first rule of remakes: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. First, they convert action hero Jack Driscoll (Oscar-winner Adrien Brody of ""The Pianist"") into a Federal Theater playwright. Second, they add a surplus of new unnecessary characters. One pointless subplot involves an adult African-American ship's lieutenant and a young white sailor. The new ""Kong"" also adds matin&eacute;e-idol movie star Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler of ""Mulholland Falls"") and turns the Skull Island natives into scary ""Lord of the Rings"" type cannibals. These bloodthirsty primitives are especially disgusting with their mutilated faces and milky-white eyes. Third, Skull Island itself looks like something from a surreal comic book with giant rocks shaped like gorilla heads while thousands of skeletons litter the landscape like something out of the 1984 movie ""The Killing Fields"" that depicted the carnage in Cambodia under Pol Pot's murderous regime. Jackson shoots all this in a semi-documentary style to sicken us. The phony-looking mammoth wall that separates the village from the island interior here looks like a poor poultry-wire model. ""Ring"" horror movie beauty Naomi Watts takes over the role of Ann Darrow created by Fay Wray in the original. Watts has a different kind of relationship with Kong. She cannot figure out whether she fears Kong or pities him. In two scenes, she performs vaudeville routines, juggling rocks and turning cartwheels, to amuse the big ape. Not even the fabulous Empire State Building finale can salvage this overripe remake. Despite its primitive movie-making effects, the original ""King Kong"" proved a magical experience for bewitched Depression-Era audiences that had never seen anything like it. The long-winded, unwieldy, new remake focuses more on mayhem than magic. The dinosaurs pale by comparison with those in the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy. Altogether, you'll have more fun watching the black & white 1933 original or the Technicolor 1976 remake than Jackson's bloated, over-hyped hokum."	1.0	King Krap!	2008-12-31	14	6	8
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3KLC5M7K1C5FJ	Vato-Curandero	"The original King Kong, released in 1933, is one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time. Using state of the art technology and stop-motion camera work, the original shocked movie-goers during the Great Depression and is part of cinematic history. The 2005 remake honors its ancestor by invoking breathtaking special effects, but overall, something just feels missing about the contemporary edition of King Kong.This is not a bad movie. It is definitely worth seeing - especially on a large, widescreen TV with surround sound speakers. This is one movie that definitely deserves to be viewed with audio and visual enhanching technology. You can view it on a standard TV, but you would definitely be missing something. The movie's action scenes make your adrenaline pump, and some scenes even make you feel as if you are in the middle of Skull Island's thick vegetation and rain forests. The special effects of King Kong are second to none, and rival those of Star Wars and Jurassic Park.Having said that, King Kong most likely will not be the type of movie that viewers will want to watch over and over again. For starters, the movie is just too damn long (3 hours, 10 minutes). Director Peter Jackson really should have trimmed a full hour off of the movie, and the first full hour just moves along way too slow. By the time Kong makes his impressive appearance on screen, consider yourself fortunate if you are still fully awake and feel like continuing with the movie. There is plenty of action and prehistoric behemoth battle sequences while on Skull Island, but even they get repetitive and old after a while; and viewers can't help but feel that some of this should have just been left out to speed the film along.The film's climax in New York City is spectacular. There is nothing like seeing the 50 foot gorilla atop the Empire State Building beating his chest and telling a squadron of primitive fighter planes to ""Bring it on!"" This is hands down the best part of the film.All in all, it feels as if you are watching three different movies: The Jack Black/setting sail/high seas segment (hour 1), Skull Island (hour 2) and New York City (hour 3). Fortunately, the movie does have some nice emotional scenes between Kong and Naomi Watts, giving it a balance between emotion and adrenaline.The special effects are so good, in fact, that in all honesty, King Kong is really one of those movies that NEEDS to be watched in the theater (rather than on your living room TV). You definitely missed out if you didn't see it in the theaters, but if you watch it at home, be sure to rent it first."	4.0	More of a rental than a purchase...	2006-04-02	3	2	1
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A35L2E8M7S59MQ	V. Berk	"4.5/5 StarsThis remake of one of the most cherished films of all time wins an award for something, a minor one, but still an award and that is that it's probably the best remake of all time.  Not much considering its competition, but still it's something.  King Kong (2005) is certainly worth a look, but I must say some critical response to the running time of over three hours considering it could easily be two hours and still give the same level of emotion, but in the end the film manages to entertain for most of its long running time, as did Peter Jackson's previous films: the big screen adaptations of Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings.The plot should be familiar with most movie goers.  Director finds map to island, gets a film crew and a young actress and goes to shoot a film.  A hostile native tribe captures the young actress and offers her to their center of worship: a giant gorilla they have titled ""Kong"".  The crew of the ship lands and proceeds - with state of the art weapons for the 1930s - past the gates and into the jungles of Skull Island.  There prehistoric creatures aren't quite extinct and they end up in a fight for their live, while the director's schemes end up with the capture of the newly pronounced ""King"" Kong and ship him to New York where - as expected - more mayhem ensues.The special effects are well done and can live up to expectations, especially the ones for Kong - not so much the dinos considering the much better dinosaurs we were shown over ten years ago in Jurassic Park.  Regardless this new adaptation of a classic tale of Beauty and the Beast has a level of emotion the classic 1930s version lacked, and that is certainly worth an acknowledgement on it's on.  In this film you can really care about Kong as more then a monster, but as an intelligent creature that just wants to be left alone.The cast was selected well, me being most surprised by how well Jack Black pulled off a dramatic role because I was expecting cheesy comic relief from him throughout the film.  This film is touching and incredibly visual, but it has several weaknesses.  There are too many characters that they try to build up only to be killed early in the script and that wastes time (but a few extras, two in particular are well worth it).  Also Peter Jackson suffers from a similar flaw he had in The Lord of the Rings films.  His action sequences are just too long, just like how he'd have a two page battle from Tolkien's book and have it go on for an well over thirty minutes or add ones that weren't in the books.  Americans like action, but when they drag to movie on to this point they seriously will have people checking their watches wondering how much longer this monkey will be smashing things up.A good film that I thoroughly enjoyed and most people will, but I can't guarantee that it can hold up to repeat viewings the way The Lord of the Rings films can.(PS:  If you like the theatrical cut I highly recommend the Extended Edition.  That is if you're willing to put in the time for it .)"	5.0	King Kong (2005) - The Remake that Did the Original Justice	2008-06-13	3	3	0

The action sequences on Skull Island are some of the best I've ever seen, particularly the Kong Vs. T-Rex battle. Also, the scenes of Kong in New York are great. Naomi Watts really makes you believe that she's acting with an actual ape and she has some affection for him in spite of the circumstances. (I especially like Kong and her ""skating"" in Central Park.)But Peter...That first hour...Goes....So...SLOWLY!Bogged down in exposition we don't need about Carl Denham and Screenwriter Jack and the other actors in Carl's movie and the expendable sailors...The original movie spent about 15 minutes on ship before finding Kong.GET TO THE ISLAND ALREADY!!So, even though the DVD doesn't give you the full cinematic experience, it is an improvement on the movie as you can zip past the dull first hour and get right onto the island.One other thing. I was hoping that Peter Jackson would tell us how in the world they got Kong _back_ to New York in the first place. How did they get him on board? What did they restrain him with? Did they just gas him up the whole time? An hour ont he Jack & Anne drippy romance, but not five minutes on this?"	4.0	Get to Skull Island already!	2006-05-08	5	1	4

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2YRHIJGRGMB6Q	Victor Schwartzman	"The original King Kong is one of my all time favourites.  Its spirit of adventure, its complete capture of the Depression era, the fabulous effects of Willis O'Brien--I can watch it again and again.As a result, I looked forward to Peter Jackson's remake with mixed feelings--there can only be one King.I saw it in theatres twice, and own the DVD.  It is a film that is at turns wonderful and very frustrating.Note: this review was written for the theatrical version.  Keep reading, and at the end of the review, I will mention the 'extended' edition.The first third of the film is fine, despite the criticisms of some. As in the original, it is important to spend some time with the characters before dinosaurs eat them.  The scenes on Skull Island are often hyponotically intriguing, with excellent special effects.  And Kong's end fate on top of the Empire State building is masterful.Yet the flaws in the film have me grit my teeth--for what could have been.The original and remake versions form an unusual comparison between their eras, and how times have changed, not always for the better.Where the original was an absolute model of economy, never wasting a second, Jackson feels the need to give us our 'money's worth'.  Instead of less than two hours (the original) his is three hours, seven minutes.  The original had a spider pit sequence which the makers deleted primarily because it slowed the film down from the main plot.  Jackson sticks it back in, and then some (yes, it was an act of love for the original, but misguided love, moving the film more towards horror than adventure, which is a critical error in judgement.)Jackson's Kong is very much an animal of its times, as was the original.  The original knew when to stop, but we live in an age of excess and excessive violence.  The original left 'em wanting more, the remake gives 'em more than they want.The natives on Skull island in the original were well dressed, relatively civilized, and violent only in kidnapping Anne Darrow (heck, Kong has to eat, right?? Plus, he is a God).  In Jackson's remake they verge on racist stereotypes of violent savages.  Was it really necessary for one crew member to suffer a violent death?  Did the natives have to be so brutal?  Where the original was suggestively violent, the remake is much more graphic.  Obviously Jackson feels we needed to be jolted for our entertainment.  Maybe he is right, and if he is, that is so sad.Jackson is not racist in his depiction of the natives, although that was my first impression.  Heck, could the natives not have been white, for that matter?  But in the end he is simply feeding into and on modern cynicism.The same problem exists with how he handled the Carl Denham character.  In the original he is considered a 'harmless' adventurer, just ""enthusiastic"".  In the remake he is a profoundly cynical man, and a real jerk.  We are told he has cinematic talent, but what we actually see is a manipulator with no apparent talent, no care for the lives of his cast and crew, even a liar--how many times does he say that he will dedicate the film to a dead crew member and give the money to the member's family?For a while I thought the problem was Jack Black, the actor.  And, indeed, perhaps in the hands of a more skilled dramatic actor the character would have come off better (what would Al Pacino have done with the part?)  But the problem is not really Black.  It is inherent in the cynical way the character has been revised.  The original Denham was likeable.  The revised Denham is despicable.And don't get me started on all the slow motion stuff that Jackson inserted.  Or the misreading of The Heart of Darkness.  Or the wasting of time on crew members who only get up eaten.  The script is often lazy, and seems to demonstrate that there was no one in Jackson's inner circle willing to say ""no"" to the Big Fella, any more than one could say no to the hairier Big Fella.  Other lazy elements of the script include how the lead actor in the film within a film is portrayed--either he's a hero or he ain't.Yet, for all that, I have watched the film several times.  I paid to see it twice in the theatres.  I bought the DVD the day it came out.  I'll probably buy the extended version.  I have the production diaries.  And the film always stops me when I come across it on a cable channel.  It is beautifully shot, often gorgeous.  The special effects are indeed special--although the sense of awe that the original had is lost in the fast cutting of the original--Jackson can't slow himself down enough, often, to just let us look.  In some ways the original was better in inspiring awe, frankly, despite all the technical ability shown in the remake.However, the remake is emotionally far more involving. What the original implied, the remake fully explores.  The scenes between Darrow and Kong are excellent, and for sure Kong is a much more expressive character.  In the original we empathised with him because of our own inner feelings, whereas in the remake Kong earns our sympathy much more directly.The original Kong was more a monster, the remade Kong is much more a character.  The original was awe inspiring as an animal/man creature.  There was a reason why the original Kong did not look like a gorilla, why it stood erect and did not have a pot belly.  I like both, but they are wildly different.  That is good: this is NOT a pointless remake.But the remake could easily have been cut by over half an hour, and it would be far better as a result.  Sometimes less is more.Yet, again, this new Kong is so clearly a labour of love that it is hard to be critical of it.  Jackson loves Kong, and it shows, over and over.  For example, in the recently released on DVD version of the original Kong, Jackson recreates the spider pit sequence.  More power to him.  Except there was a reason that sequence was cut shortly after release: it slowed the pacing and introduced a horror element.  Jackson includes it in his version, extended it and making it even more horrific--and, in the end, demonstrating that the original film's producers were wise in cutting the sequence.The extended edition?  Bought that too.  The film retains all the strengths and weaknesses of the theatrical version, adding a few new strengths and weaknesses.There are two new dinosaur sequences.  The first has the crew members being attacked almost as soon as they enter the rest of the island.  It's an okay sequence, but to my mind the film worked better as it was, introducing the dinosaurs through our first seeing that herd of brontosuari (or brontosaurises, or whatever).  There was a sense of wonder in that edit, which is now lost when the dinos are introduced earlier.The second sequence apes (can I write that, really?) the raft/dino sequence from the original.  The sequence worked in the original and it works in the extended cut.  It's very nicely done, especially the underwater stuff.Those are most of the additions.  If there was five seconds of new Kong, that was about it.Unbelievably, the spider pit sequence is extended.  Towards the end.  We now see the 'actor' character going down into the pit to rescue people--completely unnecessary build up to his character in what was already an unbelievably character twist (if he was scared enough to leave, would he have returned?)  However, Jack Black is given a few shots to look shaken by the experience, which was good.  In the end, though, the entire spider pit sequence remains out of place--it is horror, not adventure--and slows the film's pacing.Too bad Jackson did not cut the stuff between the first mate and the younger crew member, which still has no decent payoff.It is hard to recommend spending a lot more money on the extended version if you already have the theatrical cut.  And note: in the extended version the movie is now split between two disks.  That was a pain.However, for some reason, the extended cut did LOOK better.  Not sure why. I have not been through all the extras, many of which are brought together here.  The Production Diaries appear to be here, for example.  Since I have a life, I haven't had the time yet to look at them all, but it is your money's worth."	4.0	Almost Great	2006-11-11	16	7	9
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AMB2Z4FMDBWQY	"VIDFAN ""specfellow"""	"This is King Kong for the attention deficit disorder generation. CGI overkill takes away all the horror, suspense and awe of seeing Kong in the 1933 original. As other reviewers have said, Kong is reduced to a cartoon character and since all the sets are computer-generated, what 1930s detail there is comes across as completely fake. It makes Rick Baker in an ape suit look warm and down-to-earth. I can never lose myself or suspend disbelief in this film the way I lost myself in the 1933 or even the 1976 version. Speaking of which, the 1976 version, which is a mixture of soft porn, camp, and an 1970s era anti-establishment film, looks like a near masterpiece in comparison. At least the miniatures (like the subway and the World Trade Center towers) were real and fun to look at, whereas you're constantly questioning whether it's real or CGI in this Peter Jackson travesty.If each film is representative of its time, then 2005 is vapid, unoriginal, hypocritical, tech-happy, consumerist, and shallow. The 1976 version had a great soundtrack (showing the high level of originality common to 70s music) while treating Jessica Lange as a disco-era sex object, complete with Marilyn Monroe cutesy voice, in an era where the sexual revolution was about to collide with feminism. Despite this, it is still watchable and amusing, made in an era before MTV and video games led us to Ritalin. And it shows a comfort and acceptance of contemporary life, for the 1976 film was made before ""sequels"" were commonplace, and so de Laurentis had to justify the new film's existence by updating it and making it relevant to contemporary concerns (the oil crisis). Popular culture in the 70s was still about ""making it new"" unlike the 2000's, where the rage is ""vintage"" and ""repro"" and living in the past.Flash forward to 2005, four years after 9/11 and during the illusionary ""prosperity"" of the U.S. during the infamous mortgage boom, which was, in reality, based on emptiness and false promises of selling people houses they couldn't afford. By setting the film back to 1933 rather than updating it, as the Dino de Laurentis did, Peter Jackson was jumping on the ""nostagla"" ""repro"" and ""vintage"" bandwagon. The present era, in other words, apparently has no original music, no identity, just consumerism/flashiness, and the mindless CGI binge-fest exemplifies this. There is no reason to revisit the 30s except for a bankruptcy of the imagination. Noami Watts is, naturally, given the ""feminist"" treatment - in her mid to late 30s, she is the oldest Fay Wray yet, and as if to make up for her lack of glamour, she is given silly comic bits to play, like tap dancing (""hey, I have more to me than looks!""). The black guy on the ship is treated with careful respect at all times, though, strangely enough, the funny Chinaman from the 1930s is brought back in all its racist glory. Since China contributes to the high budget deficit and ""owns"" the U.S., maybe this was intentional (it's okay to make fun of the Chinese, but not okay to be racist toward blacks). Like the Guy Van Sant, shot-by-shot remake of ""Psycho,"" the Peter Jackson ""Kong"" is a waste of time."	1.0	Makes the 1976 Version Look Like a Masterpiece	2011-07-12	27	10	17

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1UNGAHNINN61U	"Virginia L. Decarlo ""Ginny's John DeCarlo"""	"The 1933 version of King Kong has always been on my '10Best Movies List' since boyhood. I hated the 70's remake as it denigrated the original. The only thing good in that version was Jessica Lange. This extended version of Peter Jacksons remake not only honors the original but pays homage to it. When I heard Jackson's next project after LOTR was to be King Kong, I became so excited, I just couldn't wait. I believed that if he treated Kong with the same respect & reverence as LOTR, then all Kong fans everywhere were going to get knocked off their feet; big time! We were not disapointed. Like other reviewers, I just can't understand why they chose to leave these extended scenes out of the original theater run. After all, Jackson fans proved their loyalty by waiting close to five years to see all the chapters of LOTR, right! As good as the theatrical release was, this extended version of King Kong like the extended versions of LOTR, raise it to a higher level. Jackson also brings to fruition the original concepts of Merian C. Cooper & Edgar Wallace. We see King Kong as it was intended to be seen 72 years ago, in it's entirety. Jackson brings this new version of King Kong to the screen with an absolute respect, intimacy & love, thereby elevating it to just about surpass the original. A lot of bunk has been stated re: the choice of Jack Black and or his over the top portrayal of Denham. To me Black creates a kind of Orson Welles figure in all of his arrogance, posturing, con man antics & wunderkind greatness. The upstart who's vision is beyond the comprehension of studioheads. How else do you play a character like that but over the top? Jackson also gives us just enough inferences to the original to make fans of the original stand up and take notice, smile inwardly, and gasp, ""Wow""! Ex: Filming within a film, Ann aboard the ship, hints of musical pieces from the original soundtrack floating about the new soundtrack, the natives costumes & dance on the NY stage. The developing relationship between Ann & Kong is superb. Ann is scared to death, she has no idea what's going to become of her so she pulls out of her arsenal every desperate trick in the book to entertain Kong, biding time until she can attempt an escape. The movie needs to develop this storyline. Without it how else could any reference to Beauty & the Beast have any relevance, any true meaning? The 'sunset scene' just grabs your heart and when it's reprised at dawn in NY, Ann & Kongs relationship comes full circle. Jackson takes the time to show how admiration, respect & love could grow between these two unlikely beings, and how one would risk death to save the other countless times. How the other's emotion could bring uncontrolable tears and anguish witnessing the attack & death of the creature. You have to build these things over time folks. You have to create distinct characterizations, introduce them,allow time to become familar with them, give them the opportunity to stand out, so that when these characters suffer or die,; you feel it! Jackson is a master at this. He creates novels of moving images on screen. Uh, excuse me; isn't that what great movie making is all about! The other thing I must comment on is Jacksons use of CGI. It's incredible! With his work, you cannot tell where reality leaves off & CGI takes over. If you're one who loves an adventure, loves to be taken on a journey, loves exceptional movies, Then Peter Jackson's King Kong is the movie for you. If you loved the original 1933 version and know it well, then you will not be disapointed. I must also take my hat off to Amazon for offering this version because not very many places retail or online, are carrying it. Amazon's price is a definite plus too."	5.0	This 8th Wonder Surpasses the Original	2009-01-16	3	2	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	"I went to this film with mixed expectations. On the one hand, it was a Peter Jackson film (Lord of the Rings), so I knew it would have high production values. On the other, with all the hype and over $200 M budget, I knew it was bound to be typically formulaic, slick Hollywoodland fare. As it turned out, it was formulaic and slick, but also an extremely entertaining roller coaster ride of a movie.When it starts out, we are treated to a wonderful re-creation of depression era New York City, a tip-of-the-hat to the original 1933 Marian C. Cooper film. We meet renegade filmmaker Carl Denham - played without distinction by comedian Jack Black - who realizes he's considered washed-up by his business associates and has to come up with a way to redeem himself. He discovers out-of-work actress Ann Darrow - played enchantingly by Naomi Watts - and talks her into going with him on an old freighter to Singapore, where he says he will be shooting his next film. In reality, he's headed for Skull Island, a mysterious, undiscovered place the superstitious crew have heard of and are convinced they won't return from. At this point, everything seems tame and predictable - but nothing could be further from the truth.Carl Denham has a plan to salvage his career, and he's willing to stoop to any level and sacrifice anybody to do it. He has mislead his leading lady; kidnapped his writer, playwright Jack Driscoll - well played by Adrien Brody; deceived the ship's captain, Englehorn - played decently by Thomas Kretschmann; and is fleeing his associates, his creditors and the law. Carl is an opportunist, a user and a liar, which was not true of the original Carl Denham. Everyone on board the freighter is ready to part company with the conniving showman, especially the captain, when they enter a fog. Where they end up - fortuitously for Denham - is Skull Island.Now the tone changes. The first thing our little party of filmmakers experience is an horrific ordeal with the island's natives, perhaps the most blood-curdling depiction of devil-worship ever. Now we realize what we're in for - but it's too late to extract ourselves because we're hooked. We, like Denham, have to find out what's beyond the great wall the natives have built.After Kong steals the sacrificed Ann, we follow him into the jungle and find out that it's a prehistoric world, untouched by civilization. One of the most enjoyable scenes is when the filmmakers and crew come across some grazing dinosaurs. Something spooks them, and the herd starts stampeding in the direction of our party. They try to get away, but soon find themselves all mixed in with this pell-mell mob, dodging giant feet and teeth and rushing headlong down a hill as the monsters step on and fall over each other. They finally come to the bottom of the hill, which ends in a hairpin turn over a cliff that many of them fail to negotiate - and so over they go. Then the cliff starts collapsing under the weight of all those gigantic beasts and people - so more go over. It has to be one of the most exciting scenes ever filmed.One of the least enjoyable scenes is when our party find themselves in a swamp, being attacked by giant bugs. The filmmakers used every means at their disposal to terrify and gross us out. When I saw that scene, I knew I would not be purchasing the DVD. It was too much and unnecessary.There were other thrilling scenes in the jungle, as well as touching scenes between the beauty, Ann, and the beast, Kong. When she tries to get on the good side of Kong by entertaining him with some of her vaudeville routine, it is both funny and pathetic. But of course, by this time, we're ready to get back to New York City with Kong and see what happens when he escapes.Once he's been captured, the filmmakers whisk us away to Times Square and the theater where Kong is going to have his big debut. This part of the film reminded me a lot of Phantom of the Opera. It was very effective, with Kong, of course, escaping and reeking havoc in Times Square. I loved the yellow cabs. A fun touch was having Kong find Ann, and together go rollicking through Central Park, ending on a frozen pond where they play around on the ice.The final scene on the Empire State Building is good, but as Naomi Watts is continually trying to climb to the top of the building to be with Kong, and he is continually trying to place her somewhere safe, I'm thinking, ""He's got more sense than she does."" Nothing in the film explains her obsession with him, or her lack of fear climbing up the Empire State Building. The biggest disappointment of all was when Kong was finally killed by the attacking airplanes, and falls to the streets below. I didn't feel any pity for him. I didn't feel anything, and I'm a big lover of animals and a big crybaby at movies. I was really stunned by this, that the filmmakers had failed so completely to move me.For special effects and a good visual roller coaster ride, this movie is a success. As far as a good story with well-developed characters, interesting dialogue and meaningful plot, it is a flop. Once again Hollywoodland has proven that a big budget doesn't guarantee a great movie.

"Peter Jackson's epic retelling of ""King Kong"" may run a bit too long at nearly 3 hours but it's an admirable and fun adventure well worth taking. Filled with wonderous Oscar winning visual effects, ""Kong"" is, indeed, the 8th Wonder of the World in this marvelous movie. Jackson manages to recreate the world of 1933 New York perfectly in this rollicking roller coaster of an adventure. Like the original 1933 classic Jackson and his crew of visual effects artists (along with a strong cast)give ""Kong"" a sense of reality even as we see all the fantastic events in the film. By the way the dialogue scene where they are shooting the ""movie"" on the boat with Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler who has a lot of fun with the role) is taken directly from the original 1933 ""King Kong"".Carl Denham (Jack Black ""School of Rock"") a producer about to be arrested by people who invested in his only partially finished movie receives a map leading to a previously uncharted island--Skull Island. He hopes to take his new leading lady Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts ""The Ring"") a down on her luck actress to the island to shoot a script by famous playwrite  Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody of ""The Jacket"" and ""The Pianist""). Denham and his crew aren't quite ready for the dangerous natives of Skull Island or the giant 35 foot tall Silverback Gorilla--Kong--that the natives plan on sacrificing to Kong. Now it's up to Driscoll and the crew of the ship to fight dinosaurs, giant bugs and their the island itself to try and save Darrow. Denham has a crazy idea when he loses the reels to his film--he'll bring Kong back to New York where he'll make millions (""I'll share it all with you boys"").The DVD looks marvelous with a faithful reproduction of the original theatrical exhibition. No doubt this version will be superceded by the HD-DVD edition when it comes out later in the year or even the multi-disc set planned for November (reportedly even longer than this edition). I don't know how much more story Jackson has to tell with ""Kong"" but this edition of the film more than fits the bill when it comes to entertainment.The 2 disc edition is the one to get if you enjoy extras. We get an introduction by Jackson discussing the film and how the 1933 original inspired him to become a filmmaker so, in many respects, this is his chance to pay the makers of that film back. We also get ""Post-Production Diaries"" most of which were originally on the website for ""Kong"" providing a glimpse behind-the-scenes in the visual effects and other effects created for the film. ""Kong's New York, 1933 feature a discussion of the importance that vaudeville and other entertainment played in distracting a city in the middle of the depression. We also hear about the skycraper boom and the Empire State Building construction all of which helped the city's inhabitants earn a living during a difficult time in our history. ""Skull Island-A Natural History"" is a tongue-in-cheek look at the ""real"" Skull Island. It's very much in the vein of his fictional documentary ""Forgotten Silver"" and is a treat.While there isn't a commentary track for the film (we'll get that on the deluxe edition in November), the extras included here are a lot of fun to go through. This is definitely worthwhile. Is it better than the 1933 original film or the 1977 remake? That's up to you to decide but Jackson makes a memorable contemporary update of Kong retelling the story for a modern audience while staying true to the film's roots."	5.0	Jackson's epic retelling of Kong a gem even if it has a few rough spots 4 1/2 stars	2006-03-29	5	3	2

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AY3FXAAUZ0CYV	WC Alaska	It seems to me that the remakes today are far too serious and dark. This is the case with King Kong remake In the beginning,Carl Denam is a tongue in cheek film maker starts out the film with humor, a sheister who is very ambitious. He is one step ahead of prison, but has visions of success, and is very driven by his ambitions. This leads to a remarkable trip to an unknown island in the Pacific where  a horrible tribe and a horrible large monster gorilla live. After a tremendous fight with the horrible local villagers the film maker's boat crew manage to capture King Kong and take him back to New York where the film maker will be hailed as a hero. Only one problem: Kong escapes, and raises mayhem in New York, stealing the heroine while climbing the Empire State building and swatting off airplanes. The end is sad and the whole movie never rises much beyond its serious dark nature.Everything is WAY TOO BIG and grand, like your typical 21st century epic, with grand special effects and big, large scenes.  As I said earlier, the film has much too dark a personality and is much too serious. And it's waaaaaaaaay too long. Naomi Watts is beautiful and athletic, and is more adept in action than acting. The scenes of 1930's New York are excellent, the film maker does a good job on capturing that bygone era.There are times, when watching some of the scenes, that the picture looks more like an Xbox game than an actual scene, the computer generated backgrounds to my eye need to come along a bit more to look more realistic.This is a good movie to watch now that it's hit the bargain rack. Well made, with good acting, I just believe the whole thing could have used a bit more schtick and slapstick humor.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A2W7GQG04QCEVT	Wendell	You know, I really enjoyed this film. It's pure action-entertainment. Pure silliness at times. The dinosaur pile-up had me shaking my head at the absurdity of it. But I mean that in a good way. This is a film that harks back to different age of filmmaking. I suppose that's fitting. It is King Kong, after all. Jackson doesn't mind combining good acting by good actors with an interesting premise and a load of special effects fun.If anything I wish there was more of this. Big segments are missed out. Like how did Kong get transported to NY? I also couldn't help but wonder about the incredible discoveries made on the island and how that would've rocked the world. Dinosaurs alive! Giant insects! An undiscovered race of aboriginal people! Any of these things would - if they really happened - be earth-shaking events. Considering this it seems a bit silly that the best Carl Denham can do is stage a show we're he displays a chained up Kong. In truth, if it's wealth he's after there would be a whole host of ways to turn the discovery into a fortune. The possibilities make displaying Kong seem like a sideshow that wouldn't even be worth the effort. Jackson deals with all this by asking us not to think about. He just fast forwards from the island to the big night in NY and keeps the engines revved up.And, honestly, I'm not complaining. I enjoyed this more than any film of it's type since Jurassic Park. It's a tribute to the filmmaker that I wish there was a super-extended DVD version. I'd happily watch six hours of any Peter Jackson film, but especially one starring Naomi Watts and a giant ape. I hope the director stays interested in big epics. Nobody, I think, does them better.	4.0	Pure silliness, but in a good way	2006-05-15	3	0	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1O60Q7LBN4MQ	Wendy Schroeder	One of our neighbors loaned my husband his copy. I didn't want to see it for two reasons. The biggest was it's too long. In my opinion, no movie should be over 3 hours long. The other is I've watched both the 1933 original version and the 1976 one with Jessica Lange.I walked in when the woman was being offered to Kong by the natives. That's where it gets interesting so I sat and watched the rest. I don't feel I really missed anything. And I have to admit that it was pretty darn good. The time went fast with all the magnificent special effects. And even if I thought the plot of Kong and Ann Darrow (played this time by Naomi Watts) silly, it did manage to be touching at times. Well, at least I felt for the big beast.I think anyone can enjoy this movie once. It's a good popcorn movie.	4.0	Worth seeing once	2006-08-05	3	1	2
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A25PM9JGHPU8EI	Wes	"Let me get the ""good"" things about this film out of the way: The super-wide angle aerial shots of NYC were beautiful. The crate with the Sumatran Rat Monkey set off a knowing smile (remember Dead Alive?). The bugs were extremely creepy. Naomi with headlights on. As for the rest? Not very good. How in the HELL did they drag Kong's monkey ass onto that relatively tiny ship they arrived in? There's NO WAY they had enough chloroform to keep the ape knocked out for the time it would take to get back to NYC. And what the hell was Naomi Watts THINKING following Kong up the skyscraper? She had the look of a woman who was desperate for attention - even if it was from a giant monkey - and was going to Stand By Her Ape. The scene of the men running with the dinosaurs was intense and highly kinetic, but downright laughable as there was no real palpable danger to be felt. It's a shame the studio likely forced him to deliver a PG-13, because what was needed was GORE and LOTS OF IT. I fully expected Kong to tear that dino's head completely in half, but no. I hate to say it, but the 1976 remake was more satisfying in that regard. I would have had a semblance of respect for this version if Naomi had decided to follow Kong by closing her eyes and falling backward, tumbling to her death. Wouldn't that have been a more emotional wallop? Right, like THAT'S going to happen. I totally agree with those saying her slow-motion, backlit walking toward Kong is among the worst moments in cinema - just absurd, and unintentionally hilarious. Why didn't Naomi talk to Kong? All she does is dance, juggle, and scream. Not having any rapport with him makes her look crazed. Even Jessica Lange knew to try and charm him that way. If there had been more BLOOD, more CARNAGE, and more DEATH I would have liked this more. But no - there's box office receipts to collect, and thus had to be watered down."	2.0	A silly, expensive cartoon	2006-01-16	27	11	16
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A17JVVAKWEB0M	Wesley Mullins	"The early reviews were some of the best ever for a ""popcorn"" film, and King Kong lives up to that acclaim. For pure action, excitement and cinema awe, there is no equal. Audiences are glued to their seats during the chase and fight scenes, and many people are moved to tears with the tender moments between Kong and Ann (Naomi Watts). But people are staying away, and those who attend do not describe it as a rewarding experience. Why? Because the film is too massive, too exciting. In a word, it is ""overwhelming"".The story is well known: a group of filmmakers (lead by Jack Black as the crew's director) travel to the remote Skull Island, a hidden world that does not appear on maps and can only be found by wayward ships lost in the fog. The island is one forgotten by time. Dinosaurs inhabit the island, but the king beast is Kong, a massive ape-like figure who uproots trees and de-jaws T-Rexs during his daily activities.Of course, the ship's beautiful blonde passenger becomes the object of Kong's desire and they develop a relationship that drives the film's action. Unlike previous incarnations of this story, Peter Jackson's version of King Kong allows the Ape and the girl to actually bond. In the PC world, he doesn't like her ""only"" because she is beautiful and blonde; he likes her because they share some happy moments together, making the final all the more tragic.The photography is beautiful, from the haunting jungles of Skull Island to the flapper-era street scenes of New York. Of course, the film's iconic moment takes place stop the Empire State Building, a scene brought to life under a stunning Monet-like sky. The most awesome visual feature is Kong himself. So real and so lifelike that viewers quickly forget they are watching a fantasy story.There is nothing bad to say about the film. The performances fit the story perfectly, with Jack Black irresistible as the gung-ho showman. The effects, sets, costumes, etc all show how great movies can look when their monumental budgets are used responsibly. But again, people only like this film; they don't love it. Why?It is just too much. The film could really use a thriftier editing. By removing an hour, the experience of viewing the film would leave people excited about the story without being exhausted from the viewing. And removing an hour would not damage the story. The most obvious subplots to cut involve the other passengers on the ship, especially their journey to rescue Ann on Skull Island. While they search for her, the film becomes unwisely similar to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. The group of ragtag would-be rescuers battles all kinds of adversities (giant bugs, dinosaurs, dangerous cliffs, etc) to get to Ann and her captor. This action has little to do with the main story (Ann and Kong's relationship) and could be removed without damaging the story.It is not a perfect film, and clearly improvements can be made. But there is still a lot to like, especially for young viewers (or the kid in all of us). In its current form, King Kong is to teenage boys what Titanic was to teenage girls; the kind of film that will find its way into the dreams of its viewers for many years."	5.0	Too much of a good thing?	2005-12-30	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1VQ8W253371UR	"Westley Merlin ""Wester"""	Hail to the King, baby. Is it Movie of the year? Read on....My reactions? I'm beguiled. Blown away. Stupefyed, even. King Kong is simply exhileratingly scintillating in every aspect possible, while retaining the brilliance of the novelty crammed 1933 smash hit. The movie was casted to utmost PERFECTION (those who are skeptical when it comes to Jack Black, well, don't worry, and even Andy Serkis make more than just cameo appearances!), no one could have executed this better than Peter Jackson. Period. It's revolting enough that this film didn't sweep the Oscars or Golden Globe Awards, let alone wasn't nominated to a satisfactory level. Yawn.Anyway, from beginning to end, King Kong is an adventure that certainly is not to be missed. Sure it starts needing to get up to its eyes, but that's because it's establishing something called the vibe of the movie..... the characters, you know, character development? Some open spaces for humour that far exceeds the pathetic attempts stabbed by the LOTR trilogy, even if some parts of the film are intentionally humourous, while not quite funny IMO.I think the movie opened brilliantly, with the zoo, the depression, and Ann Moss..... I was doubtful, but she just nailed down the part. As did that movie producer guy. Once they hop on that boat and begin their journey, the movie trudges in a whole different direction. A broodier direction, as not 100 percent stern the movie staves itself to be, it's actually a very ominious and frightening tale of courage, epic proportions, apprehension. Another thing is that the movie just FEELS so realistic - so gritty - and has that attribute that was also very apparent in the LOTR trilogy - it's the perfect collaboration of emotion, action, CGI digital special effects, superb acting, themes and deeper meanings, and a whole lot more, all coupled into a 3 hour film narrative. Infact, the movie cruised by so quickly that it felt more like a 2 hour movie to me. There's just so many sheerly intense, yet narly moments that are both full of chuckles and poignant shifts, many of them actually parallels to the LOTR trilogy, namely those large arachnid predators, that to Shelob, but that's just Peter Jackson being himself, 80s style grotesque stuff, y'know?Oh, and did I mention that the relationship between King Kong and Ann is nothing short of extroardinary? Peter Jackson certainly knows how to convey on screen now nave, yet heartfelt monstrous creature is really, no differentiated than humanity, and the fact that humanity simply refuses to inure that other life is much closer to us than we consider in our minds. The nigher the end of the movie comes, the more you realize that it's man and their synthetic weapons of destruction that's the real monster here, not harmless (in a sense, at essence) savages and species, and the like. That's the thing though - the movie actually has a heart - a soul, something that is sorely lacking in most extravagant CGI boasting movies these days. Infact, the movie is so emotinally touching that it even caused me to shed some tears.Hmm, onto the CGI digital effects. They blended it in, in a compositing sense, a lot better than they did in the trailers, probably because the Super 35mm 2:35:1 transfer was less clear, with what's probably going to be a cleaned up transfer in terms of colour rendition (also taking note of the fact that the movie was heavily digitally graded, similiar the LOTR trilogy, no such saturation was evident) MPEG-2 compression and artifacts/postersation, black/green/other colour levels, edge enhancement, and etcetra. So they weren't as cutted and pasted as I originally anticipated, and this is even more mutually beneficial and fulfilling considering the fact that CGI is integral in this movie.Is the CGI digital model of King Kong the breakthough that it's been raved to be? In my opinion, no, although it's a fine digital actor that reaches a level of emotion that you can actually feel and relate to, and as the physical presence of a live, actually existing entity and a digital entity detection can be discriminated due to the sensitivity of the human eye, I'd say it's still quite easy to tell that it's CGI. The raytraced reflections in his eyes, yet the eyes alone, were done very well though, even if it's really not as groundbreaking as the Gollumn model from LOTR, or the Yoda/Grevious model from ROTS, or Harry Potter's, err, little revolutionary creature in his digital model glory that I can't remember the surname of, not that I really am all that enthralled by Harry Potter anyway. Sorry to stray off-topic there. Anyway, yes, the effects are more than just decent.Speaking of the effects, it's minature speaketh time! Peter Jackson and his Wingnut/WETA digital team certainly managed to keep their flair for awesome loads of humungous, stupendous minatures, they're all over the place (in a great way, that is), on Skull Island, the ship, and so on and so forth. General cinematography is also takes a better direction this time around, Peter Jackson really knows how to direct with snazzy yet down-to-earth note style. On from the visuals, I had high hopes for the musical score to succeed as well as it would had Peter Jackson accepted Howard Shore's probably incredible effort. However, James Newton Howard still did an excellent job. I look foward to picking the score up, sooner than later, too.That being said, I think that pretty much rounds up my review. King Kong is a masterpiece, folks - a fantastic film that won't, in all likelyhood, disappoint. It's definitely Movie of the Year, at least in my opinion, and quite easily rivals LOTR, not that it's really in a position to, and that both movies are quite a deviation from eachother, even if they do have a similiar feel due to being crafted by the same people. I walked into the theatre with nearly impossible expectations that I didn't assume to be met - yet I was gobsmacked, regardless. And yes, when I say Movie of the Year, I mean better than Batman Begins, which was a fabulous flick. So do yourself a favor, and go see it. ASAP. The critics aren't mendacizing. Nor are the biased boneheads on IMDB. You won't regret it.Overall Verdict:Pros - Great acting, nifty story, beyond adaquate effects, magnificently thrilling moments, and an ultimately poignant adventure, and ultra-lengthy enough (3 hours and 7 minutes!!!) to fill my tastes!Cons - Sometimes not funny when attempted to be, CGI could be integrated a bit better, and a bit more elaborate. And ummmm.... ummm, yeah, I'll get back to you on the rest of the cons some other time.Score: 9.4/10.0	5.0	King Kong - undoubtedly, it rightfully donns the dubbious title of Movie of the Year!!!	2005-12-19	8	3	5

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A4OSXRZR2BMX8	"William Merrill ""eclecticist"""	While the new King Kong movie is not the modern masterpiece that Jackson's Tolkien trilogy is, it still has its share of amazing scenes.  The scene where Kong fights three T. Rex's is worth the price of admission all by itself.  The special effects are generally excellent; most importantly, Kong looks and sounds pretty real.  There were a couple of times I found the computerized effects unconvincing, particularly when the humans were being chased through a canyon by dinosaurs.  The story was a little thin in some ways, such as the slightly chopped-up relationship between Watts' and Brody's characters, but again the movie comes through where it counts, expertly delivering a big dose of tragedy in the main Kong-Ann storyline.  I was only mildly distracted by two other minor flaws in the movie: (1) the score is mostly great but gets off-track a couple of times, especially the Enya-esque angelic chorus playing during a giant insect attack on three characters, and (2) the requirement to suspend disbelief was a bit heavy at a couple of points, particularly when the Brody character is saved from the previously mentioned giant insects (which are crawling all over him) by someone repeatedly firing a Tommy gun directly at him... And not one bullet even scratches him despite killing the bugs?  Overall, though, I definitely enjoyed King Kong 2005 a lot.  It pretty much met my expectations and even lived up to the trailer (for a change)!!  Then again, I was NOT expecting another L.O.T.R.

For some reason I had just assumed (as in, ass out of you and me) this movie would be stuck somewhere between Mighty Joe Young and Jurassic Park: The Lost World - or - nice ape visuals with vague characters and action sequences. So wrong. I loved almost every minute of this movie. At its heart, I found genuine feeling and was actually touched.

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"It seems self-evident that any work of art is a product of its time. It also seems self-evident that there's no point in remaking a movie unless there was something wrong with the original, or you've found a new way to approach the material. (David Lynch's rework of ""The Fly"" meets both critieria very well. Ditto for ""The Thing"" which is not so much a remake as a ""make"".) The problem with Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" redo is that there's no way to ""improve"" on one of the greatest films ever made, without changing it beyond recognition.To see the original ""King Kong"" as a technologically dated exercise that would have been ""so much better"" if only it had been made 70 years later, is to miss the way that the medium and the message * were inextricably linked in 1932. For example...The scene in which we hear the unseen Kong tramping through the trees to Max Steiner's music, suddenly appearing in front of the screaming Ann, scares the s*** out of children (and not a few adults). It's one of the great cinematic moments, its effectiveness deriving from its in-your-face crudity. (No offense to Willis O'Brien or the Delgado brothers -- quite the opposite.) The original Kong wasn't a giant gorilla, but a horrifying id-monster portrayed by a frighteningly ugly stop-motion puppet.In converting Kong into a realistic animal, Jackson has, at a single stroke, discarded the horrific and dream-like/nightmare elements that made the original a classic. Realism is not fundamentally frightening or horrific. If you don't understand this, watch ""Nosferatu"" or ""Vampyr"".This realism, in turn, greatly weakens the original's ""beauty and the beast"" conceit. Ann's affectionate response to the big lug relects a late-20th-century view, fostered by NatGeo specials, that gorillas are intelligent, affectionate creatures -- not ugly, brutal, or automatically threatening. Fay Wray's Ann screamed her head off, overwhelmed by fear she would be killed or devoured. Naomi Watts' Ann, though frightened, sees Kong as a misunderstood critter. ""Who could ever learn to love a beast?"" Well, when you love a beast -- he's not a beast any more.This is the film's fundamental error of re-conception -- Kong is no longer a rampaging monster, brought to his knees by Ann's irresistable European blondness. ** He is now a monster only in size, munching on bamboo, rather than Ann. The original Kong was a brutal beast throughout the story, allowing us a moment of cathartic pity when he's killed. The new Kong, sympathetic throughout, doesn't evoke this contrast of emotions. ""It was beauty killed the beast"" no longer makes much sense.In describing the sacrificial maidens as ""brides"" of Kong, the original makes the not-so-subtle suggestion that Kong ""molests"" his victims before killing and eating them. (Kong's ripping off Ann's clothes to sniff them supports this, though Cooper and Schoedsack said they'd put this in because seen wild monkeys smelling human clothes.) But the new version has Ann showing a great deal of affection for Kong -- an affection which, if carried too far, would suggest beastiality, with Ann the perpetrator.Another major failing *** is that ""economy of expression"" are not words in Jackson's vocabulary. He can't resist overdoing /everything/, simply because it's doable. If the original had /one/ disgusting creature, Jackson has three or ten or fifty. The scene in which Kong is gassed and Ann bids him ""farewell"" is ludicrously drawn-out and overdone, the restored ""spider pit"" sequence is -- like my movie reviews -- numbingly overlong **** -- and then there's the allosaur battle. I won't describe it, because I don't want to spoil your incredulous laughter at its utter preposterousness. It was at this point that whatever sympathy I had for the remake vanished.The original was a model of terseness, starting slowly, but never stopping once it got up to speed. ***** The remake is not only overlong, but overwrought. Individual scenes and sequences run on for two or three times any reasonable length, to the point where the audience (this viewer, anyway) screams ""Get on with it!"".Jackson's pacing isn't so hot, either. Cooper knew when to pause briefly, then pick up again. The first hour of Jackson's version (which is actually quite good) shows that he (mostly) understands ""structure"" and ""pace"", but the rest of the film is a hotch-potch of action scenes, without any sense of development or ""build"".It's understandable that Jackson didn't want to exactly repeat the original, but too many iconic scenes have been lost, which seems inexcusable in a three-hour film: Kong smelling Ann's clothes; Kong choosing the wrong woman from the hotel, then throwing her to the street; Kong destroying the elevated train (Jackson's destruction of a street car doesn't come close to Cooper's ""German expressionist"" treatment). On the other hand, he exactly reproduces the few seconds of Fay Wray and Bruce Cabot running through the jungle, a delightful moment for those familiar with the original. Would that there had been more of this.There is /one/ sequence that shows how good this film might have been. The initial encounter with the natives and Ann's subsequent capture is much superior to the original - far more atmospheric, better staged, and more exciting. Nothing else in the remake attains this level.The BD was my second viewing of this film (the first having been on DVD). It clarified why I was offended. Jackson has so altered the original -- and not to much of a good end (other than getting rid of most of the silly dialog) -- that you sit there going ""No, no, no, no, no. This is /dumb/."" ""King Kong"" is less obnoxious the second time around, simply out of familiarity. That doesn't mean it's a good film, or that Jackson made the right dramatic or aesthetic choices. He didn't.The original remains exciting (and silly). The remake is something worse than a bad film -- it's a pointless, overlong bore.----------""King Kong"" is nothing if not a great BD demo disk. Much of the film is just plain beautiful (though I do miss the Dor&eacute; skies of the B&W; original), and is, technically, one of the most-startling films you'll ever see. Kong really looks like a living animal, and all but a handful of the CGI effects (such as the failure of the rowboats to look as if they're actually making contact with the water) are seamless. One Amazon reviewer's claim that you can see the green screen in some shots (I assume he means a green nimbus around the foreground objects) is absurd.The BD, unlike the DVD, has virtually no supplemental material, other than a running commentary. Jackson states that the commentary will try to steer clear of material presented in the supplements -- of which there are none. If you have one of the multi-disk DVD editions, you might want to hang onto it.Science note... Neither the original nor Jackson's remake (the latter especially) pay any attention to the fact that a small island cannot support large a variety of creatures -- big ones, especially -- that need food to survive. The apatosaurs, in particular, would strip the island of its treetop vegatation in just a few months. (This has been observed in elephants.)Another science note... Someone complained that Kong moves as if he were weightless. This is a common problem in CGI animation (see ""Shreck"" and ""Spider-Man""), but it isn't true here. The real problem is that Kong makes impossible leaps. The reason is that mass scales as the cube of body size, but stregth scales only as the square. If a normal-size gorilla can't leap several times the length of its body, I guar-on-tee one the size of Kong won't be able to do it, either.Writer's note... Does it ever occur to directors to have someone vet their script for errors? One of the American producers follows Universal (the studio) with a plural verb, rather than a singular, in the ungrammatical British fashion. And the Army officer, griping about Kong's invasion of the ""sacred"" New York, calls him a ""mutant monkey"". Though the word dates to the turn of the 20th century, it was not in common use in 1932.* Yes, yes, yes... Marshal McLuhan actually said ""The medium is the massage.""** I was going to say Caucasian, but Caucasians are dark-haired.*** How often does one encounter a film which can be described principally in terms of all the things wrong with it?**** It has been reported that this scene, in which the sailors who fall from the log are eaten by creatures in the pit, so revolted some viewers that they walked out. Cooper and Schoedsack said the scene was removed because it brought the film to a dead stop. Jackson doesn't seem to be aware that a long, poorly paced scene can have the same effect.***** There is probably no other movie in which most of the film is a continuous ""chase"" sequence, with barely a moment's rest. (""Speed"", perhaps.)"	2.0	more is less... much less	2009-08-29	5	4	1

""The Eighth Wonder of the World.""Pros: I could watch the crew's adventures on Skull Island over and over again. It is some of the best fantasy filmmaking to date. The indigenous islanders were authentic and creepy, their fortress was a place I would love to explore, and the island action left me wanting more, more and more.Cons: Can you say hokey? King Kong contains some of the most unbelievable and silly scenes to make it to film in the last 60 years. The ship's crew running under the legs of dinosaurs (...for what seemed like hours)? Come on Peter Jackson, this scene was one of the most laughable scenes I have ever watched. Drop the LoTR's yes-men that are telling you all of your ideas rock, and get some filmmaking help that shoots it to you straight. There are too many hokey scenes for me to remember: Kong ripping Ann Darrow from her restraints without Ann's arms being severly broken, no hint of how Kong was transported back to New York, the vine scene, the flying away hanging from a giant bat scene, the scene in which Kong was chasing the taxi, etc. Hokey. Horrible.More cons? Time wasted on Ann's relationship with her aged friend and co-cast member, time wasted on covering interaction (while they travelled to Skull Island) between the ship's crew that neither made you care, or had any impact on the plot. And my last con: by the time they finally got back to New York...bam! the movie was over. The ending was dull and lifeless. Kong atop the Empire State Building swatting at a few uselss planes? Common! He took several hundred bullet wounds on Skull Island and you're telling me a couple of hits from a plane did him in?

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1SCZ4PNKDT6AY	"W. J. Pedreira ""P"""	Peter Jackson's loving and overbloated tribute to one of the greatest films of all time.  I was eagerly anticipating the release of this film.  I really liked parts of it.  Most of the scenes with Kong are amazing.  So lifelife and so much emotion from the character.  Attention to detail (you can see every hair on the gorilla, the lighting on Kong during the Tyrannasaurus batte in the vines)is on the spot.I only wish the actors were as animated.  Jack Black is all wrong for Carl Denham.  Too young and too demented looking, not a very good actor either.  Thought that Jason Alexander or Nathan Lane would have made a better Denham. They have the ability to play a lovable con man and are so much more theatrical.  Adrien Brody as a playwright?  Why change him from a sailor to a playwright?  Makes no impact on the story whatsoever.  He seems to know from the start that she only has eyes for someone else (big & furry).The movie could have been trimmed down.  Shorten the boat trip to 15 minutes.  Lose the scene where Driscoll mistily watches his play and moons over Ann Darrow.A little more realistic outcomes would make it a better flick too.  Kong battles 3 T-Rexes, swapping Ann from hand to foot rather violently.  She falls very far from on top of a dinosaur's head, mind you, and is unscathed. Not a scratch on her.  Clothing looked pretty good too.  On top of the Empire State building Ann is clad in a little white slip of a dress and doesn't seem to be cold at all - in the winter time.  Maybe it's that big fur coat that keeps her warm?Anyway, loved Kong. Could watch his scenes over and over.  Best special effects I have ever seen in a film.  I'm a stickler for them. So disappointed in most flicks of late.  Dark, fast monsters that you can't even see.  Usually apppear at night or during a rainstorm.  Not Kong - resplendant in the brilliant sunlight.

This set goes into exauhstive detail on the making of the film and even goes into the details of Jackson's Pre Lord of The Rings attempt to remake King Kong (that never saw the light of the day). it's all just tremendously engrossing. Theres also a very funny little short film that was made by the cast and crew (as a special birthday gift to Peter Jackson) entitled ""The Gift"".So in summary: If you are a fan of King Kong and liked Peter Jackson's remake I can reccomend getting this 3 disc set for the bonus features alone and the extended cut only as a curiosity. I own this set along with the theatrical version (along with the original 1933 version) and I am happy to have all three."	4.0	The 3 disc extended cut - Get it for the features	2013-04-29	0	0	0
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A303AR58MOOYAV	"Woofboy ""Woofboy"""	"When I heard that Peter Jackson was remaking King Kong, I seriously had doubts that the movie would be any good.  Jackson had all sorts of success from Lord of the Rings, but I wasn't sure if he could come up with great movies like that consistently, and especially with a classic story like Kong!  It turns out that Peter Jackson can in fact come up with great movies consistently, and this is because of his ability as not only as a great director, but also as a great storyteller...Kong is about a Vaudeville actor in New York named Ann Darrow who is found by a movie producer that needs a leading lady in a movie.  Everyone is loaded up onto a boat, and a voyage is made to an mythical island known only as Skull Island.  Once there, the boats crew and it's passengers land on the island, and quickly realize that the ruins of and ancient civilization are still occupied by savage natives.  The inhabitants of this island capture Ann Darrow and make here a sacrifice to Kong.  The ships crew returns to the island in a rescue mission and witnesses a giant creature taking Ann into the jungle.  While searching for her, they encounter dinosaurs, giant insects, vampire bats, and all other sorts of creatures that should have been extinct like the giant ape that took the girl.  Kong turns out to be a giant silverback gorilla and is captured and is taken back to New York City where he wrecks havoc, which ends tragically.Sounds like the same old Kong story, but what sets it apart was how well the story was put together and the little details that were added to make the movie so much more realistic and emotional.  For example, I'll point this out with the Kong/Ann Darrow interactions.  Instead of Kong just creepily taking Ann Darrow and instantly ""falling in love"" with her and her having reciprical feelings instantly, this is slowly built up.  At first Kong seems to be nothing more than an alpha-male silverback gorilla who wants respect from his captive.  From the bones in his first lair, it didn't look like he took rejection very well.  Eventually, Ann gets the ape to get out of his Alpha-male mode by going into here vaudeville act which sparks his interest.  He liked dancing, he turned his nose up at the computer generated juggling, and really liked it when Ann fell over.  This made it so Kong was willing to risk everything for Ann, saving her several times from dinosaurs and other baddies.  Still more amazing detail in the dinosaur fight scenes too.  Kong kills a T-rex and after it's dead turns into a little curious monkey and starts playing with the lizards mouth (although I believe this particular detail was in the original as well).  Kong and Ann end up on the top of the gorilla shaped mountain in a cave occupied by vampire bats and the bones of rest of the Kong family. Here, Ann tells Kong that his island is beautiful by pointing and putting her hand to her heart.  Later in the movie, back in New York, while pearched on top of the Empire State building, Kong points to the rising sun over the New York skyline and starts pointing and putting his hand over his heart.  This is minutes before Kong's tragic ending, but this one detail, the fact that Kong was not just a big stupid monkey, but an intelligent ape that understood was what pushed to movie to a new height for me.  I can't remember the last time I cried in a movie, but as soon as Kong did this, it brought a tear to my eye thinking about what was about to happen.  Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and the other directors/writers that worked on this movie are genius.The special effects were superb.  In the first few wide shots of New York I was sort of skeptical of the CGI created city because it looked rather fake to me, but I only had that thought once in the beginning of the movie.  After that, the amount of realism was great.  Andy Sirkis did an amazing job as Kong, as well as playing another role in the movie as Lumpy the cook.  It wasn't quite as unique as Smegil from Lord of the Rings, but for being a completely computer generated gorilla, Kong was amazingly realistic in his appearance as well as behavior.  The Empire State Building scenes were great too.  Someone that I was with got vertigo from these scenes.Besides the long legnth of the movie which takes up quite a bit of time to watch, King Kong was flawless.  It is the only movie all year long that I can honestly give 5 stars.  In my opinion, it's academy award material..."	5.0	Peter Jackson is a genius storyteller!	2005-12-15	7	4	3
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A62VD2R3NGUMM	W. Reimers	Because I was thinking the same thing, no, not another King Kong movie!!  However, I finally saw it, or most of it, on HBO last week and I was thrilled.  It really IS good.  I liked it so much I want to have the disc to watch it quality video, as compared to cable.  I also want my wife to watch it.  The only problem with this movie is that it is long, and you really should have uninterrupted time to enjoy it.  The romance of this movie really comes to life, and you will be heartbroken for poor Kong long before his final demise.  Don't let Jack Black scare you away.  He plays the role of a real jerk, and is perfect for it.	5.0	I know what you are thinking ...	2007-02-27	3	2	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1Q15TP2FXYYMF	"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo"""	This was an awesome movie but the only real bad thing i have to say about it is that it dragged on for way too long but that is not to take anything away from the film itself.I'm not sure of the characters names so bear with me as i try and explain the plot. Naomi Watts who plays an actress desperate to make it big and she comes across a director (played by Jack Black) who is determined to hit the big time but in an unorthodox way. He wants to make a trip to an uncharted island where there are myths of dinosaurs and other undescovered creatures little do they know they are about to come across the biggest myth of all.The crew that go to the island during the film come across King Kong and basically the relationship between Kong and Naomi Watts character is a connection of loneliness. Kong is lonely because well he's just a giant ape and Watt's character is lonely because she is an actress.Enough of that before i give the movie away but this is packed with amazing action and as you have probably already seen amazing special effects. The actions and facial expressions of kong are very much like that of a real silverback gorilla.Top movie and i highly recommend.	5.0	A Giant Of A Movie	2006-06-08	4	0	4

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	"Peter Jackson's King Kong is about a film producer/director named Carl Denham and his crew's adventure on a mysterious island. They travel to Skull Island to shoot a new film, but when they find out a legendary beast and dangerous natives live on the island, their quest and curiosity puts them against Kong, the natives, and his dinosaur enemies, and while the crew attempt to catch the legendary creature, Kong's attention is captivated by a beautiful woman named Ann Darrow, which allows for the explorers to capture him and bring him to New York, where Kong's future involves commercial exploitation.My fave scene from the film is *SPOILERS* where Kong is fighting the dinosaurs, and he rips one of their heads in two, and the jaw dangles. *END OF SPOILERS*. It's just so random that Kong makes it's jaw dangle, that it's hilarious! If you love special effects, you MUST see this film! The stampede sequence alone will leave your jaw dropping, and Kong looks excellent! The ending left much to be desired, but it's still a good ending. After seeing this for the first time, I wish I saw it in theatres!King Kong is the best remake I've ever seen thus far (and I am not a fan of remakes), and one of the best films of 2005. The three hour length of the film flew by, I didn't even notice how long the film is. My eyes were glued to the screen. I think this is Peter Jackson's best film thus far, I'm not a fan of the LotR trilogy, but I've seen most of his other films, and this tops them all. If you're looking for action, adventure, or an excellent love story, you'll definitely do yourself a favor by checking out ""King Kong""."	5.0	"Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" - One of the best films of 2005!"	2006-03-29	3	2	1

B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	A1T3BZEL9IONRG	zoey1383	I was really looking forword to this movie.  All the things I heard about it on tv and read about it made it sound like it was going to be one of those epic remakes with some great computer generated stunts and other eye candy effects.  Plus a great story line that kept the movie moving.  Boy was I disappionted. I hope to save you, rent it first.  If you like and think its worth the money then buy it.  But I didn't find it worth the three hours of my time to watch it.	1.0	3 hours too long	2006-04-10	14	4	10
B00005JO20	King Kong (Widescreen Edition)	AE9GUE3HHOX3U	zooni	This is an epic movie, from finish to start.  It's almost sensory overload but total quality filmaking.  The acting and special effects are top notch, Naomi Watts is awesome (she's one of my fave actresses).  She plays second fidle to King Kong but she's not just a prop in the movie.  I love Adrian Brody as well, he adds to the movie for the hero factor.  It's a sad ending, I really don't like the fact King Kong dies at the end but hey if you don't like a sad ending, watch Mighty Joe Young, he lives at the end.	5.0	Jungle Love	2013-07-24	0	0	0
