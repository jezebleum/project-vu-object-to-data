6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3HS5U2UUSQP0N	"&#34; Anti Microchip &#34; ""Jesus Christ can ..."	With all the newer versions of this movie from the likes of Jim Carrey, and various others it's hard to convince people the old tried and true is the best. Yes this film is in black and white, and yes the transfer quality (probably due to the age of the original) is not quality by modern standards. However, this film actually can't rely on special effects and the actors actually have to act. Both of these are rare by modern standards.I also have to admit I like the direction of the older versions of this film. There are no hammy cheese ball moments just for the sake of having them. I actually felt that Alastair Sim was confronted with his nefarious lifes work, and that he was forced to himself for who he was. The message being that it's not too late to change. Faced with his own mortality the main character finally saw that he couldn't take his money with him, that his exsistance was shallow, and that he was responsible for his own unhappiness. In the end he changed. In this I actually feel this film captures the meaning of the original better than any other I've seen (which I admit I haven't seen them all).So give it try. Put away the modern computerized versions and give real acting a chance.	4.0	A classic christmas film	2010-11-08	4	1	3
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1166FE81ADOUR	50s sci-fi Fan	"The most remarkable thing about ""A Christmas Carol"" is the way the intrisic morality of the story keeps it evergreen.The film versions seems to refect the values of their time: the 1935 version on the double DVD seems somewhat stale reminder of the remote British Empire, while the 1951 Alastair Sim interpretation has much of the uplifiting cheer of the many English comedies in austere post-war Britain.The evergreen aspects of the film are also found from the 1978 Rich Little send-up of the famous and infamous of his day and the Christmas Eve 2010 ""Dr. Who"" version with Dr. Who playing the spirit of Christmas Past may become a cult film.Time will tell which Christmas Carol is the most enduring. The Alastair Sim offering, apart from the family feel good aire, has a touch of ""Wall Street"" about it as an 18th. century Gordon Gekko greed-is-good charater drives Scrooge's business partners to the wall. Scrooge and Marley coldly demand 51% of the firm to save it from bankrupcy.Sim is well able to use those trademark doe eyes to show an inner cruelty and meanace in a Scrooge on the verge of his lifetime downward spiral into bitter cynicism...an alienation from humanity sealed by the loss of his beloved sister; dying in childbirth as his own mother died giving her birth.Yet this is a story of redemption and Scrooge finds a grace denied Marley. Sim's portrayal of Scrooge makes believable that even the deadest heart may be brought to life.The restored version is well served by low-key black and white, but I didn't go much for the colorized version...the color seemed, to me, to destroy this very mood and a be a pointless gimmick to show how clever the computer technicians were. The main value the included 1935 version was to show the viality of the Sim film.A good DVD to collect."	5.0	A Christmas Phenomenon	2010-12-20	0	0	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AVBYL0BIAZ8IB	Aaron J. Palmer	"This version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is one of my all time favorite movies.  There are countless adaptations of Dickens' novel, but this one is still my favorite.  First, though it is not the most literally faithful adaptation of the novel, I think it comes closest to expressing Dickens' original themes, especially the idea of imaginative sympathy.  Second, no other actor has come close to topping Alastair Sim's portrayal of Scrooge.  George C. Scott, Albert Finney, and Patrick Stewart perform the role admirably in their versions, but Alastair Sim makes you believe in this character more than any of the others.  In the beginning, he is exactly as Dickens' described him--cold, heartless, and very much alone.  Scrooge's transformation is handled with grace and emotion.  The music perfectly complements the emotional beats.This DVD release is particular is quite a good one.  It contains the original black and white version, and the picture quality is as good as one could expect for a movie that is now more than 50 years old.  There are no special features to speak of, but this is a fine, basic DVD transfer."	5.0	Classic	2007-03-09	1	1	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2PS1KAU6MGELR	A Customer	Alas, for Jacob Marley's ghost when he responds with this line after Scrooge has told him: &quot;But you were always a good man of business.&quot;  This English version of *A Christmas Carol*, which has the film title of &quot;Scrooge,&quot; has always been the definitve version of the story for me.  The sets, the costumes, the exterior shots, and the actors and actresses all have what seems to me to be a distinctive &quot;English&quot; look to them.  Even Tiny Tim's teeth and Alastair Sim's teeth have an English trademark look to them.  This DVD version of this classic film presents an excellent opportunity for the film fan to judge the effect of colorizing on a film.  The DVD presents the original black and white version on one side of the disk, and the colorized version on the other side.  I first saw the film in black and white...and have always thought of it in that fashion.  In that aspect, the black and white presentation offers some interesting aesthetic and dramaticeffects which can be compared with the effects which the colorized version produces.  To my sense perceptions, the black and white version increases the &quot;coldness&quot; of the feel of the film...of the snow...and the huddling of people to keep warm...and it seems to increase the perception of Scrooge as a cold person.  Even in scenes where there should be a sense of warmth, such as when Scrooge is in his room huddled in his chair ready to eat some &quot;hot&quot; soup, the effect is still one of coldness.  The black and white aspect of sets and people seems to heighten the dramatic impact, making for a solemn, lonely, spiritless feel to the characters and events...which is certainly in keeping with the intent (until the transformation).  Alastair Sim's acting is so profoundly good that he does transform the tone of the black and white into a warmth of reclaimed humanity.  When he goes in humility and some fear to his nephew's house, not knowing how he will be received, and asks forgiveness for his foolishness, the black and white aspect cannot dull the warmth and humanity.  But, that having been said, I must also say that the moment I turned the disk over and began the film in the colorized version, I knew I was experiencing...and was going to experience...a different set of sensory impules...and different resulting feelings and aesthetic impressions.  For the opening sequence is of a book being opened...in the colorized version, the book's cover is colored...but it is tastefully done...and the pages are a warm ivory color.  The effect to me was enormously pleasing...then when the actual characters appear... the colorizing adds to the facial expressions...one now notices arched eyebrows, grimaces, smiles...there is a real humanity that is brought out by the color.  People's personalities are not &quot;washed out&quot; by the black and white...the distinctiveness of individual personality seems more alive with the color. This colorized version is done well...the color is tastefully done...the inside of Scrooge's house becomes more distinctive, and one notices objects that tend to go unnoticed in the black and white version.  The brown colored bannisters of the stairway are one example...as well as the statue at the bottom of the stairs.  The wooden surfaces glow with a warm brown... and Scrooge's (Alastair Sim's) eyes are an interesting, mesmerizing ice-blue color.  Formerly I would have said, as something of a film purist, that the black and white version of the film would be the one which I would watch...and show to others.  But now, I have become a real fan of the colorized version...maybe it is the novelty because I have not seen the colorized version as many times as I have seen the black and white version...but I firmly suspect that it is something deeper and more aesthetically and psychologically compelling in relation to the use of color... at least with this film (I once saw a horrible, inept, attempt at colorizing &quot;Miracle on 34th street&quot;...but I do not fault this present attempt).  I found nothing wrong with the sound on this disk...  The most haunting moments in this film, for me, are at the beginning when Tiny Tim is looking in the shop window...and the mechanical clown is laughing...Tim laughs too, for he thinks it is in amusement...but then Tim sees someone buy the boat which he obviously wanted...the look of loss and hurt on the young actor's face is unforgettable...and yet the heartless mechanical clown continues to rock back and forth with laughter...now, as if mocking Tim...Tim looks at the clown... and still in his good-hearted spirit manages a smile and a laugh, too.  My god...what an incredible piece of filmed humanity...and feeling.  There are other incredibly moving moments in this filmed version.  For me, it will always be the best.	5.0	&quot;Business?!!

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3P01JK5ZY6DID	"A. Guyton ""eluraluna"""	"I know most folks just love Alastair Sim's Scrooge, but good grief. He completely misses the character that Dickens wrote. Sim makes him a whiney, spineless insect, who keeps complaining instead of learning. And what's with ""Alice""? The whole point in Dickens is that the girl who has the strength to leave him- and thus turn her back on a life of wealth in favor of the possibility that money isn't everything- goes on and has a life with a wonderful family and happiness, not that she becomes some martyr-esque thing in the poorhouses of London. And what's with the whole series of Scrooge in business? There is so much in the original novelette, why add so much unnecessary evil? And the scene with Fan's death? Isn't it enough that Fred is his nephew- shouldn't the bond of blood be enough to remind us of the responsibilities of family (and its rewards) without making Scrooge a complete deadbeat? Besides, Sim's reaction to the scene is downright melodramatic, making him seem even whinier.Being a great fan of the book, I find this version badly acted, badly adapted, and in bad taste. There are worse versions. But this one misses the spirit of the Dickens characters, and the real messages Dickens was trying to communicate- messages that are still relevant, and were relevant in 1951 as well: the importance of family, the need for social responsibility and sensibility, the joys of the season, and interconnectedness of humankind."	2.0	Sorry, but I am a fan of Dickens' Scrooge... the character.	2003-01-25	28	4	24

Alistair Sim should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of Scrooge. If you can keep a dry eye when Scrooge revisits his dying sister's bedside--or when he asks his nephew's bride to ""please forgive an old man..."" than you might be as cold as old Scrooge was himself!  And the scene on Christmas morning is glorious--you will find yourself mimicking the dialogue to your family!"	5.0	Fantastic	2002-12-04	5	5	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A7FDKB776PE2B	Alan Beumann	Ever since I can remember, Christmas hasn't been Christmas without at least one viewing of this film.  Even waaaay back to the days before VCRs and 300 cable channels, living in a small Arkansas town, my brother and I would scour the TV guide that came in the Sunday paper to see if it was coming on one of the three channels we got.  (How did we survive?)I also have the 2002 disc, and comparing them on my setup it's obvious that alot of care has gone into the restoration efforts.  However (here comes the nit-pick)...watch the scene where the door to Scrooge's sitting room flies open in advance of Marley's entrance.  Scrooge leaps up from his chair and cowers against the wall...his mouth is opening BUT YOU CAN'T HEAR HIM UTTER HIS CRY OF FEAR!  This, to me, is shoddy audio engineering...since of course it's loud and clear on the 2002 version.  Someone apparently dropped the audio out when the transfer was being done.  Yes, I know this is a very, very minor point, but it's still a point.  So I actually give the disc creators 4 stars.  If they were as dedicated to the full restoration of this film as the packaging would have us believe, they wouldn't have missed something so trivial.	4.0	YOU CAN'T TOP ALISTAIR SIM'S SCROOGE.	2008-11-21	3	3	0

Albert Finney was good in an overblown movie.  Mickey Mouse and Scrooge McDuck, Muppets, and even Gene Lockhart (whose daughter, June, played one of Cratchit's children).But nothing stands up to this movie.  The added story elements (in Christmas Past) are all in the right vein, and the story builds to a wonderful climax.  I cannot see other movies without thinking of scene after scene from this version.  Alastair Sim IS Scrooge.  And yes, his giddiness after being saved from Christmas Yet-to-come is exhilirating. There are no weak links in this movie.  Mrs. Dilber's astonished ""For me?"" when Scrooge gives her money is just one example of the detail this movie has.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2HK26U37YRKF2	Alan of Essex	With all of the limitations of the day, compared with those available to the film-makers of today, there might be a tendency to avoid a mere black-and-white offering.Let me say this, Charles Dickens is unrivaled as a Master of the English language and his ability to bring you into his story is almost magical. Alastair Sim made this story-on-film his own, by the sheer artistry, skill and professionalism for which he will always be remembered.Any film, black and white or otherwise, that combines for us the talents of these two people cannot be less than five-star.Buy this film, enjoy it every year, just like &#34;It's a Wonderful life&#34;, it is an essential part of a Christmas family celebration.	5.0	Real actors don't need colour!	2012-12-10	1	1	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3NGZK9QTV7RLZ	Alexander Koutroubas	"There is one rather strange anomaly with this transfer, motion suddenly ""jumps,"" as if a frame or two is missing, though the soundtrack continues apace and there are no missing seconds from the timecode if you engage ""Display"" on your BD player (I mention this only for readers who may think it's a fault with the BD itself rather than the transfer). A good example of this (just one of several) on A Christmas Carol is near the end of the film, at circa 1:18:17 and again at 1:18:22, when Scrooge is at the window saying ""What a beautiful morning"" and obviously lurches. I guess it might be a missing frame, but one would expect the sound to skip there, which it doesn't. Another moment is at 1:22:18 where one would think the piano playing in the parlor would be slightly interrupted if it's missing frames we're dealing with.

On the plus side, doubling the size of this definitive edition accommodates some welcome extras, including informative interviews and commentaries and the 1935 ""Scrooge,"" which is of historic interest for the performance of Sir Seymour Hicks, who debuted on the London stage as early as the 1880s.  As for the ""uncolorized"" 1951 version, those who share my conviction that this is the most truly ""Dickensian"" of all films will rejoice in the superlative restoration in this package.  Visual nuances like pictures on walls - and their equally significant absence - are suddenly apparent, and the inimitable characterization of Alastair Sim is vividly confirmed.

There is also much bonus material, including a biography video of Dickens and an older version of ""A Christmas Carol"" from the 1930's.  The only problem with this set is the uneven restoration of both the black and white and colorized films. One moment the picture will be clear and the next it will be fuzzy.  At least that's the way it appears on my TV set when played on my good quality DVD player.  This 1951 film is a great classic but I have seen better, more consistent restoration of older films.  The movie was very enjoyable in both black and white and colorized versions, but more could have been done with making the movie look new again, considering what is available for restoration with today's technology.I read somewhere that Dickens' own granddaughter recommended this film as the finest movie version.

Some may help to explain certain situations, such as how Scrooge and his father came to be estranged and why Scrooge holds a grudge against Fred.  But others seem unnecessary such as the subplot concerning the hostile takeover of Fezziwig's.  Nevertheless this film is a definite fan favorite and is very well produced.  The roles of Jacob Marley, Bob Cratchit, Mrs. Dilber and of course Alastair Sim as Scrooge are especially well-acted.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1YN1UJNSMH2E5	Amazon Customer	I recall other movie versions of A Christmas Carol, and some plays I have seen, that portray Scrooge as a colorful but essentially harmless curmudgeon.  When I saw Alastair Sim play the part for the first time I understood  that Scrooge is no cute old man.  He is terrifying, a monster, a villain, a force for evil.  When Dickens explains that the blind man's dog drags him away from Scrooge, you have trouble picturing this image, until you see Sim in the role.  This version is simply masterful.  The added material (not in the novella) is consistent with the original story and gives insight into Scrooge's character. The acting throughout is strong but never over the top.  For example Brian Worth is convincing as Fred in his jovial nature and patience with his uncle.  Certainly Kathleen Harrison gives a masterful performance as Mrs. Dilber, with her ghoulish attempt to benefit from Scrooge's death and her colorful response to Scrooge's conversion.  This movie, like the novella, works because it captures the extremity of despair in the poverty of Victorian England and the brutal inhumanity of the main character and then effectively transforms both to joy and optimism, somehow believably, through the miracle of Christmas.  The transformation is convincing and the reborn Scrooge, as portrayed by Sim, is as convincing as a benevolent patriarch as he was as a heartless scoundrel.  The dark scenes at the beginning and middle of this film can be hard to watch for the faint hearted.  Nevertheless the genius of the film is that the impact of the end of the film is stronger because of the sadness and despair shown earlier in the film.  If one softened the despair the ending would be much less effective.  There may be other decent versions of this story, but I plan to stick with this one for Christmases in the foreseeable future.	5.0	No cute old man	2013-12-22	2	2	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3BI7U1IZ7RAKU	Amazon Customer	"I have been watching this movie since I was a child in the 60s. Never have I ever seen such a magnificent job of restoration of a classic film. Not only is the picture unbelievable the audio is perfectly restored as well. Watching this in Blu-ray is like watching it through a new set of eyes. I watched it on a 50 inch Pioneer Elite plasma screen with an LG 390 player. I just received it today the 23rd of December, I paid extra to have it shipped overnight. No Christmas in the past 30 plus years will be Christmas without having watched this film. The restoration is so clear that I have seen detail in this version I have never noticed before. For instance, if you carefully watch the scene after the last ghost has departed and Scrooge has awakened and is conversing with his char woman, just after he says "" I feel as giddy as a drunken Man"", he steps toward his dressing mirror. You can see a man's face reflected in the mirror and slowly peek out of the shadows. Most likely a stage hand or lighting grip who got in the way and had to duck back into the curtains. They kept the scene intact, how could they possibly improve upon that take. Back then they probably figured no one would ever notice, they didn't fathom the development of Blur-Ray. I have never been able to see such detail before. This restoration is simply amazing and well worth the money. Merry Christmas!"	5.0	Amazingly beautiful!	2009-12-23	3	2	1

Frankly, some of the supporting cast can be a bit wooden, but Sim's snarly miser is pitch-perfect.Not only does he nail the mean Scrooge--which most decent actors in the part have managed well enough--but he makes the joyful Scrooge, the redeemed Scrooge, the Scrooge ecstatic at the chance to right wrongs he believed beyond hope, live as vividly as the caricature of the stingy old grumpus.  Of all the myriad film and stage versions, this is certainly not the one that hews closest to the original text, but it is the one the gets the trickiest and most important aspect of the story right.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AXOZ5BWOEDL76	Andrew C. Miller	A Christmas Carol [Blu-ray] [1951] [Region A] [US Import] Alastair Sim's tour-de-force performance as the ultimate miser, Ebenezer Scrooge, has almost single-handedly made this beloved version of Charles Dickens' story into one of the best-loved Christmas films of all time. Some of Britain's best filmmakers united behind Sim, who was joined by a delightful cast of accomplished and acclaimed English actors; creating what many today believe to be the best and most faithful production of Dickens' immortal tale.Cranky and curmudgeonly Scrooge learns the error of his unkind ways and is taught the true meaning of the holidays when he is visited by the ghost of his late business partner and the spirits of Christmas past, present and future.This Blu-ray edition has been digitally restored from a new 1080p, 24fps high definition transfer master produced from the 35mm negative and fine grain.Cast: Alastair Sim, Kathleen Harrison, Mervyn Johns, Michael Hordern, Hermione Baddeley, John Charlesworth, Glyn Dearman, George Cole, Rona Anderson, Patrick Macnee, Carol Marsh, Francis de Wolff and Miles MallesonDirector: Brian Desmond HurstProducer: Brian Desmond HurstScreenplay: Noel LangleyComposer: Richard AddinsellCinematography: C.M. Pennington-RichardsResolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 1.37:1Audio: English: 5.1 Surround Sound and 1.0 LPCM Mono AudioSubtitles: English and SpanishRegion: Region A/1Number of discs: 2Running Time: 86 minutesStudio: VCI EntertainmentAndrew&#8217;s Blu-ray Review &#8211; Over the course of film history, few literary characters have been resurrected more often than Charles Dickens' legendary miser and Christmas killjoy, Ebenezer Scrooge. Several esteemed actors, from Reginald Owen and Albert Finney to George C. Scott and Michael Caine, have barked at Bob Cratchit, growled &#34;humbug,&#34; and giddily danced a jig - all with a fair degree of relish. Yet one Scrooge consistently stands apart from the pack. Alastair Sim never achieved much renown in America, but in Britain he was a pretty big deal, a deft character actor with a basset hound face, a mellifluous voice, and a gallery of bemused expressions. Alastair Sim enlivened many a dreary feature, and if a vote were ever taken to crown the quintessential Scrooge, he would surely win. His take on the crusty curmudgeon who's transformed by three ghosts into a benevolent softie one cold Christmas Eve in Victorian London remains iconic, and the version of 'A Christmas Carol' in which he appears is required viewing for countless families each holiday season.Americans especially revere Dickens' time-honoured tale, but it's no surprise the most engaging adaptation of 'A Christmas Carol' comes from its native England. There's just something about this 1951 version that screams authenticity. Yes, liberties were taken with the original novel, but the mood, atmosphere, and characterizations remain a cut above other films. Noel Langley, one of the writers of 'The Wizard of Oz,' fashions a tight screenplay, and director Brian Desmond Hurst combines whimsy and melancholy with a hint of creepiness that honours the yarn's ghost story roots. The black-and-white photography enhances the darker elements of the story, adding welcome tension, and the production design exudes a distinctly British look and feel that help immerse us in mid-19th century London.A wealthy yet bitter man who would rather count his money than his blessings, Ebenezer Scrooge retires to his stark, run-down flat on Christmas Eve, seven years to the day after his unscrupulous business partner, Jacob Marley [Michael Hordern], passed away. A paranormal disturbance, however, in the form of Marley's chain-laden ghost, interrupts his tranquil evening. The celestial Marley warns Scrooge that unless he alters his selfish and greedy ways, he is doomed to endure a similar restless, tortured afterlife. The only way Scrooge can possibly prevent such a horrible fate is to meet with three spirits, who will try to humanize the irascible miser by revisiting his troubled past, looking at his unhappy present, and pondering his uncertain future.All the character actors who portray the supporting parts are perfectly cast, right down to arguably the least annoying and saccharine Tiny Tim [Glyn Dearman] in any version of 'A Christmas Carol.' Yet despite their excellent work, they can't compete with Alastair Sim. His Scrooge resonates so strongly because he's always disarmingly real. A palpable sadness and air of regret seem to swirl just beneath the surface of his scowls and sneers, so we sense his vulnerability and root for him much sooner, and his ultimate transformation seems more believable because, deep down, it seems to be something Scrooge sincerely craves.Brian Desmond Hurst's film employs some rudimentary special effects and adopts a darker tone than most, but relies on good old-fashioned storytelling and top-flight acting to put over this beloved yuletide tale. If you crave flash, music, Muppets, or 3D, there are plenty of other adaptations of 'A Christmas Carol' to tickle your fancy, but if you like your Dickens neat, with no frills or embellishments and lots of heart and substance, then this 1951 production is the one for you...and will be for many Christmases to come. God bless it, everyone!Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; At first glance, the 1080p image transfer for this 60th Anniversary Diamond Edition of 'A Christmas Carol' doesn't look much different than the one on the 2009 Blu-ray, but upon closer inspection I'd have to say it makes a few subtle improvements. Clarity is ever-so-slightly enhanced and contrast appears a bit more pronounced, lending the image more vibrancy. Black levels are superb, with marvellous shadow delineation emphasizing the film noir feel of many scenes. The snowy whites also hold up well, maintaining their texture in varying degrees of light. Not surprisingly, grain is fairly pronounced, but seems similar to the previous version; some scenes exhibit more than others, but it never overwhelms the picture. Close-ups are quite nice, often highlighting Alastair Sim's large, expressive eyes, and background elements exude a fair degree of detail. If you're thinking of upgrading your copy of 'A Christmas Carol' based solely on video quality, I'd say it isn't worth it. The enhancements aren't notable enough to merit the expense. But when coupled with the new audio and supplements (both described below), trading in your old copy for this new edition makes good sense.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; VCI Entertainment puts out some great flicks on home video, but the company needs some better quality control when it comes to advertising the contents of its discs. Aside from the plethora of new supplements (described below). Unfortunately, the audio options on this Blu-ray are not up to the standards set by the generally excellent image quality. The Two Digital mixes are included, the English: 5.1 Surround Sound and the 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio. Both choices sadly leave quite a bit to be desired. I frankly couldn't stand listening to the 5.1 for very long, as it is saddled with such bad chorusing and reverb that I personally found it unlistenable, that is why I have informed you above that it is best to set your amplifier to Stereo. That same chorusing effect is still apparent, though less bothersome, in the original mono track. The original track, while not egregiously damaged, has noticeable hiss and an overall boxy sound that is evident throughout both dialogue and underscore, though that problem is widely variable. For instance, the opening bass-heavy brass music sounds pretty acceptable, but then the first patch of dialogue has an over- reverbed sound. That use of reverb is similarly variable, and seems to abate once the film moves into its more intimate, interior sections. The 5.1 mix manages a few ambient surround moments, notably some of the music and foley effects during the Spirits' appearances, but there are really no &#34;wow&#34; moments in the surround repurposing.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Introduction By Leonard Maltin [5:06] Leonard Maltin talks about what an impression this film made on him as a kid, and also gives some background on the film. A word of warning, in the menu it says that it is in 5.1 Surround Audio, well do not have your amplifier set this way, you must have it as Stereo, as in the 5.1 Surround Sound Audio, you get a terrible echo sensation and is very off putting.Commentary by Marcus Hearn and George Cole &#8211; Without a doubt, the most disappointing aspect of this disc is the 2005 audio commentary by Marcus Hearn and George Cole, who plays the young Scrooge in the film. One would think Cole would have lots to impart about the film's production and its cast, but amazingly, only about a quarter of the discussion has anything at all to do with 'A Christmas Carol'; the rest focuses on Cole's career before and after the film, other British actors with whom he worked, random thoughts about Alastair Sim, and observations about making films in general. We do learn 'A Christmas Carol' was shot in the summer and many scenes were modelled after illustrations from the original book, and that the movie received mixed reviews upon its initial release. Cole talks about his close personal relationship with Alastair Sim, and how the actor mentored him, and calls director Brian Desmond Hurst &#34;very flamboyant.&#34; More scene specific remarks would have been welcome, as well as biographical information about the cast, and facts about Dickens and the original novel. This very shoddy effort left me wondering... Why bother to have a commentary at all if the participants are going to largely ignore the film they've been enlisted to discuss? No one with any interest in 'A Christmas Carol' should waste their time listening to this rambling, unfocused mess.Dead to Begin With: The Darker Side of a Classic [26:31] British Film Culturalist Sir Christopher Frayling offers an extensive examination of the film and how it ties into the turbulence afflicting post-war Britain at the time of its initial release. He talks about, among other things, the underrated work of director Hurst, the versatility of Sim, the importance of seasoned character actors to make Dickens' novels come alive, the ominous music score, and rudimentary special effects. Frayling believes this is a darker telling of the tale than most adaptations and also more adult and substantive. Clips from other film versions of 'A Christmas Carol' from the silent era onward enhance this absorbing and comprehensive piece that's well worth a look. In fact, this featurette is so good, it begs the question... Why wasn't Frayling asked to do the commentary instead? In 26:31, we learn far more about 'A Christmas Carol' than the commentary tells us in triple the amount of time!Scrooge by Another Name: Distributing 'A Christmas Carol [9:47] Film distributor Richard Gordon reminisces about financing and marketing 'A Christmas Carol,' and how producer George Minter set out to make the definitive version of Dickens' classic. Because the movie ended up darker and more serious than other adaptations, it was more difficult to distribute in the U.S., which sought more family-oriented fare during the holiday season.The Human Blarney Stone: The Life and Films of Brian Desmond Hurst [41:14] Allan Esler Smith, the great-great nephew and biographer of Hurst, chronicles the life and career of the underrated and largely underappreciated director of 'A Christmas Carol' in this reverent documentary. More film clips illustrating Hurst's work would have been nice, along with more personal details, but the piece succeeds in shedding light on a figure who accomplished much more than directing a renowned holiday film.Alastair Sim Version: Too Good to Be Shown Only at Christmas [32:00] Fred Guida, author of 'A Christmas Carol and Its Adaptations,' provides an insightful and absorbing audio lecture accompanied by film clips and stills from a wealth of Dickens movies. Again, much more interesting and informative than the audio commentary, this piece covers the Dickens renaissance that began with David Lean's 'Great Expectations,' adaptations of 'A Christmas Carol' from other countries, the complex character of Scrooge and how this film meticulously reflects it, how the screenplay altered and embellished various scenes from the original novel, the contributions of the fine supporting cast, and quotes both positive and negative reviews of the picture. Fans of this version definitely don't want to miss this enlightening featurette.Scrooge (Silent) [10:17] This surprisingly entertaining - albeit very brief - silent version of 'A Christmas Carol' was produced in 1922, but not shown in the U.S. until 1929. Henry Vernon Esmond portrays Scrooge, and the lively film efficiently hits all of the story's high points. Video quality is pretty good for a 90-year-old antique.Bleak House (Silent) [10:14] Dame Sybil Thorndike stars as Lady Dedlock in this (very) truncated 1922 adaptation of Dickens' novel. The acting and filming styles recall the old melodramas of yore, but this is still a fun curio that's worth checking out.Theatrical Trailers [4:00] Both the Original British and American Trailers are included. Each runs about 2 minutes, and it's interesting to note the differences between them, most notably that the American trailer continually emphasizes the film's festive and joyous aspects, while the British trailer provides a more balanced look at the movie. One thing that I thought was bad is the original British trailer, I feel they should of spent some money in upgrading this, especially as it is such a Classic British Film.Scrooge Revisited &#8211; This short piece looks at some of the actual London locations where 'A Christmas Carol' was shot, and shows how they look today.Campbell Playhouse: A Christmas Carol [59:22] Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, one of America's fondest holiday traditions was the annual Christmas Eve radio broadcast of 'A Christmas Carol,' starring actor Lionel Barrymore as Ebenezer Scrooge. (Barrymore was scheduled to reprise his popular role in MGM's 1938 film version, but an injury forced him to bow out, paving the way for Reginald Owen to portray Scrooge.) Here we have the rare opportunity to enjoy one of Barrymore's signature broadcasts, with a young, pre-'Citizen Kane' Orson Welles as narrator. This very faithful adaptation originally aired on December 24, 1939, and is well-acted, atmospheric, and quite involving. Just listening to the distinctive voices of Barrymore and Welles is a treat!Finally, when I first heard about the re-release of 'A Christmas Carol' a mere two years after its first Blu-ray go-around, but I'm pleased to report this 60th Anniversary Diamond Edition is a big step up from its 2009 counterpart. Improvements include slightly better video and audio track, and a cavalcade of well-produced, substantive extras. The film itself, of course, remains a timeless classic - endearing, inspiring, festive, and just dark enough to add sufficient impact to its themes of redemption and renewal. There never was and never will be a better Scrooge than Alastair Sim and this excellent production showcases his iconic performance to perfection. So toss that old Blu-ray aside and pick up this much-improved anniversary edition that's a fitting tribute to one of the world's finest holiday movies. I have of course found this the ultimate version and I am now so proud to add this to my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!Andrew C.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2SWW3OWEGLN2O	Andrew Kear	Every Christmas holiday a whole slew of Christmas Carol films come out with varying degrees of quality. They go back to the cruder days of film, up to modern versions implementing special effects. The film that achieves that right balance between good special effects and effective atmosphere is the 1951 version of a Christmas Carol. The film creates  a realistic portrayal of England in Dicken's time. The film makers portray the streets as rather dark and lonely. The only life seems to be in the window of a toy store where 19th century toys are displayed  in their glory. It seems to be Tiny Tims favorite window. Alastair Sim plays Scrooge to the extremes. Scrooge here is seen as a greedy and cynical. When he goes to his front door is greeted by a knob in the shape of Bob Marly's face.  He merely dismisses  it as a result being fatigued.No complex CGI was needed, just basic overlapping film. The lack of technical finesse actually makes it more scary. This whole film shows the effectiveness of old world cinema craftsmanship. In many ways this film could be considered a horror movie. The ghosts are faint, but their screams and echoes  that rumble through the house are unforgettable.What sets this movie s part from the other Christmas films is the authentic view of Victoian England, and it is not a romanticized version. It is especially creepy how the ghosts roam the dark corridors of the house. Marely`s ghost is especially disturbing, his voice during normal conversation is agreeable, but during distress he gives out a moan that will forever live in the spiritual world.Even if most of this film was done on a soundstage, it is so effective in creating industrial English that you barely notice. Alastair Sim shows his versatility as actor by giving a brilliant transformation from Scrooge to a man filled with the spirit of Christmas	5.0	The Best Scrooge Movie	2011-12-24	0	0	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AB4F6UHL20U95	Anne Rice	For me, this is the ultimate A Christmas Carol.  For long years, before and after video recording, I was desperate each Christmas season to catch this on television, and of course I came to add  video tapes, and lazer disks of this to my subsequent collections.  But this new Blu Ray DVD is simply beyond anything I ever imagined.  The clarity of the picture and sound, the gorgeous contrast, the wealth of new visible and audible detail in every scene is overwhelming.  This is a magnficent film.  Those unfamiliar with it will come to love it, as they treasure Alastair Sim's remarkable portrayal of Scrooge. And there is not a wasted face or voice in the rest of the film.  All Dickens' characters --- from Tiny Tim to Old Fezziwig to Mrs. Dilber  --- are brought to life with perfection.  ---Also  worth noting: one of the  things that distinguishes this version is a plausible and compelling backstory for Scrooge which is not in the original novel by Dickens.  These  sensitive and subtle additional scenes --  filling out Scrooge's early life --- resonate beautifully with the original material.  They only add, never detract. George Cole, who portrays the younger Scrooge looks credibly enough like Alastair Sim to make the material all the more effective.  The music in this film is tender, beautiful and haunting, especially the Barbara Allen theme connecting Scrooge's sister Fan with Scrooge's  later, post transformation, visit to his neglected nephew and his lovely wife.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  If you love Dickens you must have this. If you love British film, you must have this.  And it will make a fabulous Christmas present for those who have not yet discovered it, or who long to see it again.  We'll be playing Scrooge  every Christmas season in my house as we have done for years, only with renewed enthusiasm and enjoyment, thanks to this stunning restoration.  Also recommended: David Lean's Great Expectatons and Oliver Twist. Perhaps we'll see Blu Rays of those soon, but until then the latest versions are well worth it to experience Dickens on the screen.	5.0	Magnificent new version of the greatest classic.	2009-11-27	6	3	3

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB	"ANT ""azraelart"""	"There have been many versions of Charles Dicken's classic Yuletide novel, ""A Christmas Carol,"" but none so beautifully acted and with such amazing cinematography as the Alastair Sim offering.  Although little known in this day and age, he was nevertheless one of the better actors of his time.  His classical roots and depth of range make him one of the most versatile actors to be found in film of the time period.The story is one you probably already know, but few really capture the translation from book to film quite so accurately as this version.  Also, as much as I admire the efforts of other wonderful actors (Patrick Stewart, Michael Caine, etc.), I truly believe Alastair Sim captures best the complete scope of Scrooge.  He perfectly conveys the inner being of Scrooge from early on as the ""squeezing, wrenching, grasping, clutching, covetous old sinner"" to the reformed father figure who was, ""as good a master and as good a man as the good old city or any other good old city ever knew.""  From facial expressions, to body motions, to inflexions and vocal tricks, he is unsurpassed as the best Scrooge ever.The supporting cast, while again not well-known in the Hollywood circles (remember, though, this film was made in the UK), shines as brightly as Sim in their respective roles.  Look for Patrick Macnee of ""The Avengers"" fame as the young Jacob Marley, one of the few other recognizable names in the States.  (I would have to imagine that in the UK and possibly in Europe, many more of the supporting actors and actresses are more famous, so I do not mean to slight them in any way, merely that they are not as well-known here in the States).I can say with certainty that you need not rent this one first to preview its quality.  I would highly recommend to any fan of Dickens, A Christmas Carol, British cinema, holiday classics, or just good family-safe films, to pick up this DVD and add it to your collection.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3MOJIDU8VRZGS	Anthony King	"Although the title is wrong. This movie is actually called ""Scrooge"" and NOT A Christmas Carol. This 1951 version starring Alastair Sim in the title role, is my favorite version of all time. Much as Sean Connery is the only Bond, Alastair is the only Scrooge for me.I have collected many versions of this movie from the early VHS days to this new Blue Ray version. I have to say I was very impressed by the print and quality. The Sound is also very good. I have watched a 16mm print of this movie years ago and what always impressed me about that print was the depth and atmosphere created by film and the focus grain being visible. I also noticed on the Blue Ray the same focus grain, which to me just enhances the experience of this classic.I would recommend this Movie on Blue ray to any potential buyer. As a life long fan of this movie I got just what I wanted, the ultimate version for all time.Buy it you won't be disappointed.I have enjoyed reviewing this release and will review more movies if Amazon send me free copies....."	5.0	Scrooge - Blue Ray - Alastair Sim	2010-01-30	2	2	0

This is less. We have here, three black and white versions, one on blu-ray, two on dvd including a 16.9 version. I do believe the 16.9 version has been previously released. Looking at the cover, one might have expected there to be at least one colourised version. The quality of the picture on blu-ray is just fair, the 5.1 sound quite awful. This really is of little value if you have a recent dvd version. I purchased this because I have previously lent out my dvd's, never to be seen again.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AXSH6O4OP5L4M	"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen"""	"Every year I watch the 20 or so movies I associate with Christmas.  Though not all are actually about the holiday or its origin, they all have something to do with the feelings and meaning attached to it.One of the most important stories about Christmas, and the one that is most often credited with shaping it for modern society is Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol.""  There are several versions of it, all to a greater or lesser degree faithful to the original tale, and I enjoy many of them, each for what it has to offer.One of the earlier versions of ""A Christmas Carol,"" though by no means the first, is one of my favorites by Alistair Sim.  It presents the usual costume and pageantry of the 19th century venue of the original story, and because it is in the black and white filmation of its own era (1951), captures the essence of early modern dramatic cinema as well: the careful attention to light and dark, to textures and to the meaning of objects in space, the novel camera angles, all of which capture the mystical character of the story and the dark emotional elements of its message of damnation and salvation, the whole point of the story. All of these cinematic aspects effectively create a delightful ""event"" for the viewer.Alistair Sim was a marvelous choice for the role.  He manages to capture the growth and redemption of the character and so expertly walks the thin line between loathsome and pitiable that we are fully able and willing to see ourselves in him--which is again what the author intended.  His shear exuberance and physical joy is wonderful to behold, and the effect of its unexpectedness on others who know him well is delightful.  I look forward every year to the shriek of his housekeeper as she throws her apron over her face and races for the stairs, fleeing undoubtedly for her life.  In fact all of the auxiliary characters are wonderfully portrayed.  One of my favorite scenes is that in which the rag man receives stolen goods from the scullery maid, the housekeeper and the undertaker.  Those of you who remember the series Maude will find in this film a very young and beautiful Mrs. Naugatuck, Herminone Baddley, as Mrs. Cratchet, and those who enjoyed the old series The Avengers will also see a very young Patrick MacNee.  In all the film is a delight, and I watch it every year.For fun examples of later remakes, I suggest:  The Albert Finney musical versionScrooge, the Muppet Theater musical/animation versionThe Muppet Christmas Carol - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition, and the superb dramatic version starring George C.

Scott version at all. My favorite is the 1970 version starring Albert Finney as a musical. But Alastair Sim as the sinister old Scrooge in this 1951 version is a must for any classic movie buff.I chose this double movie offer, both b/w and color, because of the price. I don't like color remakes of classics and have never owned one before, but I watched the color version first. It was done very well and added much to the picture.  The reason I didn't give this review a ""5"" is because the audio was a little off. At times, it was tinny and sounded like they were speaking in a tunnel, but it got better as the movie progressed. Max Fleisher's cartoon ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"" (1944?) is also included and while wonderful and nostalgic, the audio was dreadful and mismatched to the characters speech. I still enjoyed it.I have the VHS of both the 1970 and 1951 versions, although nothing to play it on! If you receive this DVD and it's defective, I would return it.

His partner now seven years dead comes back to warn Ebenezer of his afterlife fate if he does not change his ways. To assist in this task are three spirits, Christmas past (his past), Christmas present, and Christmas of things to come. Can or will Ebenezer change his ways? Why should he?There are many versions of this tale floating around out there including study books and animated movies. Of all these versions, a few stand out.Made in the era of black and white, one cannot help but shun any attempt to colorize it. The Alastair Sim version is a product of its day and he does a very good job of portraying Ebenezer Scrooge. He comes across as mean in his speech of ""Are there no work houses?"" and stingy, displayed during his meal, upon hearing that more bread will cost 8 pence extra he says, ""No more bread.""On Christmas morning he goes overboard with the maniacal laughter. This is probably emphasized to show his change of heart and to allow him to scare the maid. However it does distract from the story. The story is modified a bit but unless you have been reading the book you will not notice this. To tie his childhood memories of his sister to his present day nephew, they play ""Barbra Allen"" in the back ground (nice touch.)All in all this will make a nice addition to you Christmas collection.There are many versions of this tale floating around out there including study books and animated movies. Of all these versions, a few stand out.Well with all the media adaptations, we finally have Blu-ray. From history, I find that a good remaster and a 46"" screen work well enough. However, because I have a Blu-ray player I chose Blu-ray when ever available at any cost. I am not so sure the film is really cleaned up or remastered. However, it is quite sharp black & white. The film is quite sparse of DVD extras. You will find the Commentary by Marcus Hern and George Cole (Young Ebenezer Scrooge) under the setup and not the extras.

As with VCI's BR release of GENEVIEVE, all moving objects in A CHRISTMAS CAROL had a jerky movement to them as though the print was missing every second and third frames.  Reminded me of a very bad silent stop-motion film.  I suspect VCI must be using some new type of coding, but until I'm sure, no more VCI blu-rays until I'm sure thie problem has been corrected.  Again, I've only seen this VCI blu-ray problem on Samsung machines.  Don't know if they'd play any better on other players.  Last year's VCI CHRISTMAS CAROL shows no problem at all.  I wonder if it could relate to the higher TV refresh rates of today.  Darn shame.

There have been many attempts at making this story into a movie, but none have succeeded like this version.  Sim breathes life into the character of Ebeneezer Scrooge, the kind of life that made you boo and hiss at all the arch villains of the old silver screen.  Even more impressive is Sim's portrayal of the &#34;redeemed&#34; Scrooge, who, after being visited by the Spirits of Christmas, decides to be more giving ang forgiving toward his fellow man.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1N2D7LLBAY25B	"Black Cat de La Bear ""see that dark shape o'r..."	This is the magical and wonderful 1950's version of the story and it is the best.  It is the scariest and the most fun to watch by far. It adhears to the story, but has extra parts too and I like that if they explain something relevent and enrich the characters or plot.  I am only thirty-four but still like this version better than the more modern ones. I do not like Kelsie Grammer's cheesy musical version at all.  I make it a tradition to watch This Alastair Sim verision presented by Patrick McNee(Tiny Tim) on UPN every 5th of December.  However they didn't show the colorized version this year, but the B&W is shown on AMC. I Think that it was originally shown in Cinimascope but is not availible in that aspect ratio on DVD.  This is great for kids and adults alike as with all of the Christmas Carole shows which relate to everyone.	5.0	how could anyone NOT like this	2004-12-13	3	1	2

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3GKMK6KQH3Y1H	B. Niedt	"There must be dozens of versions of this classic Dickens tale in existence, from Michael Caine and the Muppets to a TV version with Marlo Thomas (?) in the Scrooge role, not to mention animated versions starring everyone from Mister Magoo to Mickey Mouse.  (My personal favorite is the TV version starring George C. Scott.)  But this is considered the definitive version, the 1951 British film with Alistair Sim in the title role.  (For some reason, it was originally released as ""Scrooge"" but has come to be known, at least here in the States, under the original story's title, ""A Christmas Carol"").  And indeed, it seems that Sim's portrayal as the redeemed miser is the standard against which all subsequent performances have been measured.  It is still considered the most ""authentic"" version of the story on film, even though, like most other versions, it still takes some liberties with the story (like changing Scrooge's fiancee's name from Belle to Alice, for some reason).  The cast may be largely unfamiliar to U.S. audiences, except perhaps for the wonderful Hermoine Badderley (Mrs. Cratchit), and Patrick Macnee (John Steed of ""The Avengers"") in a small role.  But as one would expect from a British production, the performances are uniformly fine.  It's still an inspiring movie, and essential for anyone who wants classic holiday films on DVD.This two-disc package contains the usual extras (a rather dry commentary track, bios of the stars, etc.). There is also a colorized version of the film (for those of you who prefer that god-awfully fake process to the original black-and-white) introduced by cast member Macnee, and an earlier 1935 film version starring Sir Seymour Hicks (which isn't bad, but makes you appreciate the Sim version all the more).  Also included is an interview with George Cole, who played young nephew Fred in the 1951 version (and still looks rather dapper today), and a short piece demonstrating the restoration of the film."	4.0	Classic Movie, So-so Extras	2007-10-04	1	0	1

I did not see this version first but it quickly moved to the top of the list. As so many other reviews have said so well, Sim is masterful. My reason for adding comments is to point out what a superb job Noel Langley did with the screenplay. MANY scenes are NOT from the book, yet unlike other screenplays taking immense liberties with a source, it WORKS. Mr. Jorking, the Christmas Day encounter with Mrs. Dilber, the last interview with Marley before he dies, the confrontation at the start between Scrooge and the debtor... all creations!

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AD2DDHLD6FRFM	Brad Baker	"VCI Home is releasing a brand new DVD of the 1951 classic ""A Christmas Carol"", a remake of the 1938 film.  Ebenezer Scrooge learns the true meaning of Christmas and reforms after being visited on Christmas Eve by four Ghosts.  Scrooge is a cruel miser.  The spirits show him how his behavior has degenerated over the years, and how his heart has grown cold. The apparitions try to melt his steely soul; they help him learn the true meaning of Christmas. Alastair Sim's performance alone makes this a great movie. Really none can compare with Sim's portrayal of Scrooge. The lusty joy he displays after his ""rebirth"" is a marvel to behold. The solitary character of Ebeneezer Scrooge is carefully drawn here. It's a crystal-clear portrait of his lonely, selfish life. He comes home, shelters himself from the winter cold, locks himself away in his home, and counts his money. He attends only to his pitiable self. Sims, as Scrooge, time-travels back to his own past: witnessing how he lost young Alice, his sweetheart. The gentle creature Alice decides not to marry Scrooge, for she learns money means more to him than her. Scrooge can barely watch as the event from his past is re-lived. It is heartrending. She tells him: ""There's more in life than money"". ""A Christmas Carol""s supporting cast is superb. Hermione Baddeley plays Mrs. Cratchit. The British actress enjoyed a lengthy career in American movies and television, and at Disney Studios.  She was remarkable in 1964's ""Mary Poppins"". Veteran Ernest Thesiger plays the undertaker. Although he made sixty films in a fifty year career, he will always be remembered for his plumb role in the 1935 ""Bride of Frankenstein"".  Rotund Peter Bull has a small part as a businessman. He appeared in, among others, the 1964 classic ""Dr. Strangelove"". ""A Christmas Carol"" was produced by Renown Pictures, a generally low-budget studio that released the old English Mother Riley comedies. They are infamous for ""Mother Riley Meets the Vampire(1952)"" starring Bela Lugosi.  Strange for Christmas, Dickens' book is really a ghost story. Spooking lighting and nimble camerawork provide a few shudders, even today. When Marley's ghost throws open the window to reveal a strange world of suffering specters to Scrooge's eyes, a truly haunting effect is achieved. The two-disc set has many extras, including the original black-and-white version,  a colorized version, a bonus movie(""Scrooge"" from 1935), audio commentary by Marcus Hearn, and three featurettes:  ""Spirit of Christmas Past"", with actor Gearge Cole, ""Richard Gordon Remembers Renown Pictures"", and ""Charles Dickens, His Life and Times"". You also get two trailers, before-and-after Restoration Comparison, cast bios, and a photo gallery.  This DVD, released by VCI as a ""special deluxe edition"", actually replaces a few earlier versions of ""A Christmas Carol"". Previously, the movie was sold as a double-sided disc, color on one, black-and-white on the other. Then VCI released a new version, with each color and black-and-white version on their own discs, sold seperately. This new transfer is the result of different original 35 MM artifacts. The quality is good. Blacks are solid, but white levels seem too dark. The sound is thin, but the dialogue is OK. Not bad for a 50-year-old public domain film. The 1951 ""Christmas Carol"" is surely a classic for all-time. Dickens' message is clear. So true in the 19th century, and so very true today.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AYQP8XMHTG2YR	Brandon J. Smith	"I don't think there's any question as to whether this movie deserves a high star rating. After all, this is THE classic rendition of A Christmas Carol, featuring Alastair Sim as the definitive Scrooge. A perennially aired film in the holiday season, the only question is: Is it worth owning? While one can only answer that for oneself, I can say this: If your answer is yes, this is the edition worth owning.A great dvd package begins with a great movie, then ads special features worth viewing, and then tops it off with smart packaging. This ""ultimate collector's edition"" does all three perfectly. First of all, this is a two-disc set, giving the viewer the option to view the film in any of a number of forms: restored 4x3, restored 16x9 for widescreen viewing, the colorized version, or the 1935 version of the tale (""Scrooge,"" starring Sir Seymour Hicks). The special features include commentary, a featurette on Dickens, and a before and after restoration comparison, to name a few.The packaging is expertly done, as well, with a nice plastic case within a cardboard slip-cover, so you know the discs are well protected (unlike some multi-disc packages that feature overlapping disc-holders, which drive me batty).The picture looks fantastic, and the sound is crisp and clear. The one thing I would fault this dvd for is the look of the subtitles. Perhaps it was only due to my dvd player, but, when testing them out, they were a strange red that came out fuzzy and hard to read (like when a television is getting bad reception), even given the black-and-white background. Overall, though, this is an outstanding restoration and repackaging of the classic film."	5.0	The Classic Film Wonderfully Restored	2007-09-22	2	2	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2JGZACQ7YB7R8	Brian D Jackson	While many have tried, no-one has captured the essence of Dickens so fully as in this early 50's version that to many defines once-and-for-all the characters of A Christmas Carol, and Sim's Scrooge is the centerpiece -- a man utterly without a heart, whose transformation by the spirits of Christmas is so believeable, so transparent as to be the standard by which all subsequent Scrooges must be judged.  True to Dickens while flexible for the sake of film-making with a mythically pastoral England and a very good supporting cast, including The Best Marley's Ghost (my opinion) and a wonderfully entertaining Mrs. Dilber, the housekeeper, this one is the very best film version available and with the improved sound and brighter images in this anniversary edition, this is the one to have -- unless you insist on the over-the-top visuals of the &quot;colorized&quot; edition.	5.0	Peerless	2003-01-06	5	5	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	"When I think of my childhood memories of the Christmas holidays one of the first things that come to mind is Alastair Sim and ""A Christmas Carol."" It was a family ritual and as rituals go, it wasn't really Christmas until the family gathered around the television to watch it. It was a terrifying experience for me back then. The sound of those ponderous chains clanking on the wooden staircase as the ghost of Jacob Marley headed towards the upstairs bedroom of Ebenezer Scrooge would send me running from the room. I don't think any film ever frightened me as much as this one did.What could be more disturbing than the ghostly apparition of poor, desolute Jacob bound for eternity, his punishment for the life he so selfishly wasted while among the living. Having learned the truth too late to save himself, he must now wander the world forever unable to intervene for good in the affairs of men.Ebenezers' only hope of reclaiming his humanity and saving himself from a similiar fate is to encounter three more spirits. Traveling into the past, present and future with his disembodied hosts he comes to understand how the choices he has made and will continue to make in life affects not only his destiny but the destiny of those around him.Ultimately Ebenezer returns a 'Man of Wisdom' and like a holy man in estatic trance rejoices in the received knowledge dancing about and singing, ""I don't know anything, I never did know anything. But know I know I don't know anything!""Make no mistake, the '51 Alastair Sim production is the definitive version of ""A Christmas Carol"" so don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1OV5Z33TMMUWH	Brian	I didnt need to read 600 reviews to know I would like this movie, as Ive watched it many times all of my life. But I was interested in what I would get if I ordered this particular Blu-Ray DVD release, which did not seem to be posted in any of the other recent reviews. Ive had [standard-def] a combo B&W/Colorized version that Ive watched every year for several years. But since it was somewhat grainy I thought the Blu-Ray seemed like a good idea. When I finally got it from Marketplace I watched it last night. Tho there are several pictures on the front and back of the dust-jacket of color scenes, the Blu-Ray is 'not' colorized as Id assumed it would be. Also the Blu-Ray is in 4:3 ratio, not widescreen; tho the Bonus disc (2-disc version) has wide-screen B&W standard-definition (pretty much the same as the old one Ive had for years). Tho there is some mention in the Extras of the 60th Anniversary edition, the dust-jacket says nothing about that, but the Extras described on the one on Amazon that 'does' say 60th Anniv seem to be the same ones on the one I received. There are a few worthwhile Extras about the history of the movie,this is about all Ive gained in this purchase. I know nothing about the technical aspects of making the video, but it seems if they can show it in wide-screen in Standard Definition, they could also show it in wide-screen in High Definition.	4.0	A bit disappointed in this release	2012-12-27	2	1	1

The sound has been changed to 5.1 digital surround, and there's even a widescreen version for 16:9 televisions.The special features include an earlier version of Christmas Carol (not as good as this one), as well as several featurettes on the movie, interviews with the stars, a feature on Alistair Sim, and others.You can tell the distributor put a lot of effort into this restoration and it shows.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2CZPM110DW516	"Brian W. Fairbanks ""Brian W. Fairbanks"""	Charles Dickens' timeless tale of Ebenezer Scrooge and his redemption on Christmas Eve has been endlessly adapted but never more effectively than in this 1951 production in which the great Alastair Sim lays claim to the miserly Scrooge as decisively as Boris Karloff did the role of the Frankenstein monster. Aside from Sim, what makes this version so special is director Brian Desmond Hurst's ability to convey both the grim aspects of the tale as well as the joy. Until the climax, this is, after all, a dark tale of one man's journey from bitterness and greed to a truimphant rebirth as a man of love and compassion.Perfectly cast, with Mervyn Johns splendid as Bob Cratchit and Ernest Thesiger (Dr. Pretorious of &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;) delightfully morbid as an undertaker as cadaverous as his clients, no other version succeeds as well as this one. And in black-and-white, it's as glorious as the first snowfall of winter.	5.0	The perfect Scrooge	2003-12-20	4	3	1

Many consider it the best short story (70 pages) ever written. There have been more film versions of A Christmas Carol than any other story, the latest has Micheal Moore as Scrooge. This version in B&W; is by far the best. Other reviews praise the style and narrative of this version, and miss the fact that this is the story word for word as Dickens wrote it. Dickens like Shakespeare is best in his own words. Alastair Sim heads a great cast, Even death is the best one ever done. I have watched this movie on TV, DVD, and VCR, every Christmas Eve since the late 50's when it first came out on TV.

Because I can't help it---it really is THE BEST!!  One reviewer said Sim's acting was &quot;over-the-top&quot; and so &quot;hammy&quot; that it made him &quot;squirm.&quot;  I know we are all entitled to our opinions, but I can't let that comment pass without saying this:  Most versions, such as Patrick Stewart's, leave me thinking as I watch. &quot;this is only a movie.&quot;  But Alastair Sim's &quot;over-the-top&quot; acting makes me feel that I am actually peeking in on the real life of a man in 19th century England.  A man who has truly been given the opportunity to see himself as he is, and who after being shown this, although reluctantly, still allows the experience to gender true repentance within him.  And the absolute JOY that comes with his heartfelt repentance is tangible to the viewer!  Perhaps that's why that one reviewer felt like squirming.  This is the giddy happiness that one would truly feel upon being given that &quot;new lease on life&quot; that true repentance brings.  Sim captures it so BELIEVABLY that you can easily forget it's a movie.  From the moment his maid asks him if he's himself today and he answers distractedly, &quot;I don't think so.  I hope not!&quot; to the moment he feels that he must stand on his head, to the moment he laughs at Mrs. Dilber's, &quot;to keep me mouth shut?&quot;, to the moment he decides to send a huge turkey to the Cratchitt's and scurries around giddily looking for a label, &quot;Label, label, label, label,&quot; Sim's performance is a masterpiece of REALITY!!  I admit his acting IS &quot;over-the-top&quot;---in believability!  Although the whole movie is well done and the supporting actors are superb as well, still the whole movie takes us to the jewel of all scenes---Christmas morning.  I've seen 9 or 10 versions---and this one is NOT over-rated!  However, almost any movie may seem so if a person is expecting too much.  Lots of hype does damage to the way in which we see something, if we are expecting TOO MUCH from it.  But even having said that, I still say---the 1951 Scrooge with Alastair Sim is the best SCROOGE out there and ONE of the best FILMS of all time!	5.0	Seeing's Believing!!	2002-02-15	3	3	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AI3CT82VXVSFR	"C. Glen Williams ""Filmie"""	The Disc Itself:VCI Entertainment has a reputation as a cut-rate house, dealing primarily in public domain works, which made me wonder about picking up a blu-ray from them. I was pleasantly surprised -- the film is crystal clear, rock steady, and if there are any splices they weren't where I noticed them. This film has been beautifully restored and upgraded in image quality, and I hope we get to see more blu-rays of these classic films with this much attention paid to the transfer.The Movie:One of the best-known, definitely one of the most influential, and considered to be the best adaptation of A Christmas Carol ever committed to film. Alastair Sim's interpretation of Scrooge is lower-key and more realistic than a lot of the cinematic Scrooges have been, and this adaptation dares to touch on elements of the book that are usually skipped over. Also of particular note, where most modern adaptations focus on the Cratchit family's place in Scrooge's life, this adaptation treats them as a part of the whole. Where other adaptations spend almost the entirety of Christmas Present dwelling on Tiny Tim, this movie spends more time on Scrooge's past and on the present of other people around him. Finally, the Christmas Future segment is far ahead of its time. Anybody interested in the genres of horror and/or weird fiction would do well to study this segment and the chilling atmosphere it creates with little in the way of modern special effects.	5.0	Beautiful HD, Fantastic Film	2010-12-26	2	2	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1PCESNDC808ZM	Charles Griffin	"...And that's Alastair Sim's definitive performance as Ebenezer Scrooge. His transformation from pathetic wretch to hysterical exuberance is beyond words. I'm not sure any actor will be able to duplicate such a performance. Other actors (like George C. Scott and Michael Caine) have been able to successfully provide their own interpretations however.That said, I cannot bring myself to rate the 1951 version of Scrooge: A Christmas Carol as high as other versions. Though it's one of the shortest renditions at less than 90 minutes, it seems like one of the longest. Part of the reason why is that it spends so much time visiting Ebenezer Scrooge's past. Not only does the film touch on aspects that the other films do (the break-up with his girlfriend, etc), but they also cover his sister's death while giving birth, his first meeting with Jacob Marley, his and Marley's takeover of the business (I don't care what anyone says, no child watching this ""family"" film will be interested in watching business transactions like the one depicted in this scene - neither will some adults), and they even show Marley on his deathbed. I haven't counted, but this film must devote at least 30 minutes to Scrooge's past, which doesn't leave much room to cover his present and future. This is a problem, because they spend more time on how Scrooge became a bitter old miser and less time on his emotional transformation toward good-heartedness...thank goodness they had Sim to pick up the slack.As much as it pains me to say I also have a problem with how dated the film seems to be. This movie looks more like it's from the 30's or 40's instead of 1951. I don't know if it's due to budget constraints or if they just haven't taken good care of the original film. It just looks old and washed out...and I love films from the 50's many of my favorites are from that era.There's one more thing. It's not a big deal, but have you noticed the young actor playing Tiny Tim? I mean, he has to be at least 15 years old! I might be wrong, but I don't think ""Tiny"" Tim was in his mid-teens! The sight of Bob Cratchet carrying around this adolescent on one of his shoulders is hilariously absurd.For years, the 1951 production of A Christmas Carol has been considered by many to be the best interpretation of the Dickens' classic, thanks primarily to Alastair Sim's brilliant portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge. To that, I say ""Bah, humbug!""  The best treatment of this tale not only needs a great performance from its lead actor, but from the entire cast. The film should also be told with just the right atmosphere and pacing. The 1951 version meets none of these criteria. When regarding the classic story of A Christmas Carol, we don't have to settle for a film that rides on the coattails of its lead actor's performance! For my money, the 1984 production of A Christmas Carol with George C. Scott has always been the best...and after viewing the 1999 Patrick Stewart film, it still is!"	3.0	It's Got One Thing Going For It...	2004-01-05	32	7	25

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2Z7SBMEY87OJ0	Charlie	"Just a quick note about this new Blu-ray release of ""A Christmas Carol"".  There are a couple reviews here (especially the one from Peter Prainito) that express disappointment over flaws in the picture.  Admittedly there are a few small glitches -- some apparent missing frames that make tiny jumps (my wife didn't notice them) and a very brief, odd waver in the background in one scene.HOWEVER, lets have a little perspective.  The picture quality is remarkable -- very sharp with good contrast and deep blacks -- and it's such a VAST improvement over the DVD versions that those small issues are easy to forgive.  Remember, this film is in the public domain (meaning anyone can legally sell whatever terrible copy they have) and that this is not a release from a major studio -- VCI is a small company that specializes in public domain movies on DVD.In short, A Christmas Carol has NEVER looked this good, and this is one of the best upgrades from  DVD to Blu-ray that I've seen.  (BTW, the picture is much better than the sound.  There's no upgrade at all over the DVD audio. It's acceptable, but nothing special)If you're a fan of this movie, don't worry about the nit-picking reviews -- it's not flawless, but this is easily the best copy of this film that has ever been released.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2YNQ54WC7SRV5	C. Hochscheid	"...Alastair Sim's performance in Dickens' holiday classic results in THE definitive filming of the story, breathing life into the familiar plot while earnestly hewing to the author's vision.On Christmas Eve, miserly, callous Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his former partner and by a series of other supernatural agents, who try to bring him to a realization of his own mortality and the emptiness of his cramped existence. The heavy-handed political subtext--poverty and ignorance are the evils that Scrooge nurses through his reliance on the ""sufficiency"" of workhouses and orphanages to care for the poor--is handled with skill, and even in its most obviously manipulative moments is true to Dickens' intentions. But Sim's amazing embodiment of the character is outstanding, coursing through the range of human experience toward a giddy, heartfelt redemption that is truly earned. The result is a fable that is as irresistible as it is corny, as compelling as it is predetermined; in short, a classic.The script is almost entirely taken verbatim from the original text; Hurst's otherwise unexceptional direction succeeds largely by peopling the film with superb British character actors (e.g. Bull, Hordern, Baddeley, Marsh, Patrick Macnee as the young Marley, and Elsa Lanchester in an uncredited cameo) and letting them have fun with Dickens' prose. Most versions of the story, particularly a 1984 TV film with George C. Scott, gloss over Scrooge's loss of self-control, without which his redemption becomes impossible.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2112A5O4073WT	C. M. Kimball	As a kid, one of the defining moments of Christmas afternoons was sitting back to watch A Christmas Carol, starring Alastair Sim.  Since then, other versions have come and (thankfully) gone, but Alastair Sim remains as the quintessential Scrooge for all seasons. Whatever you do, maintain the spirit of the film by ordering your copy in the original black and white: the scene with the shadow of the rising window in Scrooge's bedchamber - to cite only one instance - is impossible to render in a colorized version, which, in general, destroys the somber mood necessary to the story. Sim is brilliant. While George C. Scott is good, the level of emotional involvement is not up to Sim's performance.	5.0	A Holiday Tradition	2003-12-18	4	3	1
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3HRTSBFHCCOJK	CMOS	"I find it amazing how many people rip on a DVD or Blu-Ray purchase because there ""weren't enough extra scenes"" or some other nit-pick. While a valid area for review, the main point of your review should be about the MOVIE. Particularly old movies which don't have 5 different versions floating around on DVD like all of today's movies, where one might be tempted to compare the ""modern features"" or extras between them.Anyway, this is far and away the best rendition of ""A Christmas Carol"" ever filmed IMHO. While the style and method of acting is not familiar to today's younger generations it is nonetheless extremely compelling and entertaining both in its humor and its more somber themes. Even the special effects, for such an old movie, don't really distract you any from the story. They fit right in mostly. I have never tired of watching this version of a Christmas Carol, and I doubt if I ever will.Beautifully done during an era of film-making that should never be forgotten. Most kids today don't even know what constitutes a ""good movie"". By many parents' standards you'd think if ""it's good enough for them to stare at it uninterrupted for 2 hours"" then it must be ""good enough"". Not so! Movies like this, like North by Northwest, and many other old classics put today's ""movie stories"" to shame. Do them a favor and make them sit through this old BW some time! They might not appreciate it right away but eventually if ""subjected"" to movies from this era enough, they'll start to ""Get it"". :-)"	5.0	There is None Better.	2008-12-20	4	4	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A23UB49EG29MVT	Commenter77	One can see the progress of the popularity of the classic old story as the remakes go through the years.  This one is up in production values and talent from the 30's versions.  I don't know if there were any in between; it doesn't appear so.  Dickens certainly got his point across with this story, and it seems more sharply drawn with each remake. Indeed, this version is the most intense and effective Scrooge to the date of its release. Scrooge didn't set out to become grossly insensitive. He became embittered by one of life's injustices and turned in on himself and everyone else out. Anyone can do that by varying degrees. It was clearer to me with this current viewing that, though Scrooge readily agreed with justice's claims upon himself as he was shown the man he had become, he could not envision being able to be forgiven or to change, though he earnestly desired it.  What a priceless gift to be forgiven when desiring to change, and then with that, finding the ability to change come alive from within.	4.0	"Not a Trite ""Morality Tale"""	2012-12-09	0	0	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	ATYKXNLVOZN02	Constant Viewer	The 1951 British film of Dickens' *A Christmas Carol* is perhaps the only screen retelling of this story that stands outside notions of time or space.  As powerful as we may reckon George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge in a later TV-movie, that film bears the imprint of its own time, as does the musical *Scrooge* with Albert Finney and the apalling musical version starring Kelsey Grammer that was unleashed on us some years ago. The 1951 film does not bear the imprint of either its time or place of origin. It is plainly a British film of a story by an English author, but in its vision and quiet authority it lends weight to the saying that film, like music, is a universal language.I can't recall when I first saw this film.  It was surely on TV, probably when I was an adolescent, but I must have been in high school before I took notice of it as something special. Now I can't imagine the holidays without it.  It isn't Christmas until I have seen this film 3 or 4 times (starting on Thanksgiving evening).This is the film that most intimately and commandingly traces Scrooge's descent from a lonely yet idealistic youth to aging miser. The first scene from his past, a visit to his boyhood school, forecasts his later isolation as we see him seemingly forgotten by his family, doomed to spend the holidays alone until his adored sister comes to fetch him.  The sister even drops a hint that Scrooge's father might have undergone a change of heart similar to that Scrooge himself experiences.There are two minor flaws in this masterful and touching film. One, I confess, always irritates me:  the Cratchit kids are supposed to be Cockneys, but all six of them babble in flawless Oxbridge.  At least central casting didn't insist on straightening Tiny Tim's front teeth.The second flaw involves a charlady who appears for the only time in the film's most powerful scene: Scrooge's housekeeper, an undertaker and the charlady meet at a junkman's shop to sell items purloined from the home of an unnamed man who has just died.  (The viewer knows the dead man is Scrooge, who watches the ghoulish display with the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come, but is unaware that these are reactions to his own death.) The housekeeper and undertaker appear earlier--the housekeeper comes to Scrooge's office to tell him Marley is dying, and when Scrooge visits Marley's deathbed, housekeeper and undertaker wait at the head of the stairs. Their appearance in the junkshop scene symmetrically echoes their presence at Marley's deathbed--but we have not seen the charlady before, and I have long suspected that an earlier scene involving her must still be someplace on the cutting room floor.Unsurpassed in its penetrating views of human nature, pain, love and joy, this film deserves a place in everyone's collection and a role in everyone's holiday enjoyment. It has to be kept in mind that this film was made in 1951, and even transfer to DVD format cannot overcome some of the FX scars that still existed at that time.  The most obvious is the arrival of young Scrooge's sister in his schoolroom; as she rushes toward her brother, she runs right through the phantom of the older Scrooge, and the traces of double-filming are evident to an extent that would never pass today.  The same kind of problems plague sequences in which Scrooge is seen supposedly flying through the air with the spirits of Christmas Past and Christmas Present.But such problems pale beside the eloquence, for example, of Tiny Tim's vigil at a toy store window while Mrs Cratchit buys the family's Christmas goose.  Delighted by the display of playthings, he is drawn first to the mechanical image of a laughing clown, and then to a model steamship.  As the model ship is taken from the window and sold, Tim is downcast. The shot cuts back to the laughing clown, whose grimace and merriment now seem to mock the child.  Not a word is spoken, but the scene encapsulates as fully as ten minutes' worth of dialogue the message Charles Dickens spent most of his life trying to convey to his contemporaries.	5.0	Independent of time and space	2004-08-26	9	8	1

Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer"""	"Aside from the excellent Jim Backus renditionMr. Magoo's Christmas Carolwhich really clearly carries to chidlrne the tale (and its Christian moral against greedy capitalism which brings us only poverty and eternal punishment in the afterlife for those of us who deny our brothers and sisters and children nourishment and warmth: ""I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat . . ."") without the trauma of ghosts and shape shifting doorknobs (as animated and thus acceptable), this is the best and the only Christmas Carol for adults and children.""Mankind was my business!""Several Hollywood attempts have been made and all fail miserably, includingScroogeandScrooged. This is the greatest. Otherwise, gather your children on your lap before the fireplace and read the book together, most favorably atA Christmas Carol (Dover Thrift Editions)although illustrated editions also exist.A secret to share with those who know: while we reviewers believe we will earn extra credit for praising this version highly, the best of all time is hidden here on the second disk: a 1935 B&W; version with a far better Scrooge, an infinitely better Cratchitt (whose poverty demands not wattles but skeletal thinness, long stork legs and deep humanity and heart) and an excellent and superior ghost of Christmas Present. All it lacks are the special effects but so what? It makes up for this with talent. It is also the better adaptation for including the coal bit of business in the office of Scrooge and Marley when we fist meet Cratchitt - this scene defines both Cratchitt and Scrooge and is painfully left out of the version here at hand. And MArley's great and telling line: ""Mankind was my business!"" is followed by ""Charity, forebearance . . .""I cannot bore you with all of the product details so well enumerated and commentated in so many other reviews and upon this product page (including the correct comment: ""What were the thinking in the eighties!"" regarding the unfortunate, misbegotten yet eminently avoidable colorized version, which I actually do not find as objectionable as some and in fact quite evocative, especially as it was made with a subdued palette and from an unrestored version, and thus the grotesque over acting of Marley's Ghost recalls more the agonized anguished of the damned who must see the evil they have brought without the power to redeem it, and not just carpet chewing by a hammish actor over-emoting, as the restored version appears.)I cannot begin to describe to you how excellent and true this film really is, which works so well on so many levels. This two disk set (quite generous for a film so brief) contains a wealth of EXTRAS which truly fulfill the substance of its advertised status as ""Ultimate Collector's Edition.""Notice there are three versions given here, with the colorized version with the elderly Patrick McNee's (who plays the young and slender Marley) warm and hospitable introduction on the second disk with the superior if crudely editted 1935 version mentioned above, and the restored 4x3 and the restored 16x9 on the other disk.I am grateful for the Spanish subtitles to share with my Spanish reading friends, and the English subtitles for my own at times hard ears. Subtitles nevertheless are always optional. The audio commentary also is optional, but may be slightly welcome upon a second viewing, and is not necessarily entirely as droning, annoying and arguable as much of these commentaries, including anything by John Carpenter, or the outrageous Cowie Criterion commentary to that greatest film of all time:Grand Illusion - Criterion Collection.I did discover nevertheless the commentary on this collector's edition of Christmas Carol disappointing, as we hear an alleged expert in cine but meek interviewer trying valiantly to drag some memory at all out of the unprepared actor who had played the young Scrooge some fifty years earlier and therefore now hitting eighty years old could not remember very many details at all.But enough of my own babbling on like an unwelcome noisy neighbor in a multiplex movie theatre, liable to receive a bucket of buttered popcorn upon my head. Let's watch this great movie in love and again! And do try the 1935 version, and of course the great Magoo!Mankind IS our business.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1GNU389TJISGB	Daniel Barron	The movie itself is excellent, my favorite Carol, and a yearly tradition for me. I read the book during early December and then watch this at midnight in the dark on Christmas Eve. Woo! :^) I enjoy some other versions (specifically, Scott, Stewart, and McGoo :), but this one feels the most authentic as you watch it, IMHO. People say it's the 'closest to the book' but in reality it has more scenes that are not in the book than most versions. But those scenes are so well realized, and so true to the &#34;spirit&#34; (you'll pardon the expression) of Dickens' original, that they make for the best overall version, IMHO. Not just the best Carol, but one of the best book adaptations of all time, and quite an excellent film in its own right.The quality of the transfer is excellent. It's crisper and clearer, and with a higher contrast than many a version I've seen on TV and video tape. Details pop out. Easily the best I've seen. If this movie is a favorite you should get this version, rather than struggle through the TV or YouTube versions each year.That said, the extras on the DVD are just OK. The commentary with George Cole, who plays the young Scrooge in the movie, is moderately interesting, but not well-prepared and more about Cole, his career, and his relationship with Sim, than the film. Would have liked to have heard more about the movie itself, but as I said, it was moderately interesting. There is an interview with Cole that covers much of the same ground, and is therefore a bit redundant. An audio-only interview with the producer of the film which I did not find so interesting, a photo gallery which is mostly (but not only) stills from the movie, and text bios of the main actors and the director.There are two extra versions of the movie. There is a 16x9 version they made basically by cropping off the top and bottom of the restored version and magnifying what's left. Can't imagine why *anyone* would want to look at that. I saw several scenes where characters were reacting to something that was in the frame, but now is not. Complete waste of time. There is a colorized version. I personally don't care for colorized movies, but I could see why some would *if it was done well* but this is not. It's clearly some old colorized version from the public domain. It is NOT a colorized version of the crisp, restored version of the movie; it's an old, fuzzy print, and colorized badly. If VCI had used its improved version and colorized it well, it would be much more worthwhile (though, again, I personally would still watch the B&W; version).There is a copy of the 1935 version starting Seymour Hicks, a good version I enjoy mind watching, but unfortunately it's a bad print. Again, would not mind seeing VCI take a crack at restoring it, if that's even possible.To sum up, I'm glad I bought this, even at a too-high price of $39.99, but only for the excellent restored, 4x3 version of the Sim film. The rest of it seems to have been added only to boost the price tag. What would have been great is just the restored 4x3 version, with the commentary, interviews, and bios, on one disk, for $19.99. That said, I'm still glad to have the restored film and since I will likely watch it every year for decades, I'm not too bothered by the price I paid.	4.0	Movie is excellent, extras so-so	2013-12-29	1	1	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	This 1951 adaptation of A Christmas Carol, starring Alastair Sim as Ebenezer Scrooge, is hailed by many as the best adaptation of Charles Dickens' timeless Christmas story.  Certainly, it is a very good movie more than capable of bringing a tear to your eye as you witness Scrooge's rebirth as a man who vows to keep the Christmas spirit in his heart every day of the year, but I must admit being rather bothered by the way this presentation oftentimes wanders far afield of the original storyline.  The film does tell the story in all of its larger facets in the proper way, but it often takes its own path toward the predetermined destination.  This is noticeable very early on, as some of my favorite lines from the story are paraphrased and expressed in different terms than what I was expecting.  Such a reworking of the dialogue becomes a trademark of this production, but this in and of itself is something of a quibbling matter.  What strikes me as much more serious, however, is the fact that this film presents scenes that do not exist in Dickens' story and to some degree rewrites what actually was written.  All of these innovations, which I see as quite needless, take something away from the full effect of this powerful story upon me.It is interesting to watch the manner in which these filmmakers of mid-century presented the four spirits that visit Scrooge in the early hours of Christmas morning.  Jacob Marley and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are basically shown as mere reflections of sorts, very lightly translucent beings, and I must say this works fine, especially since this is a film of the heart in which special effects are largely incidental.  I would have liked to see Marley's mouth drop open dramatically once he removed the sling from his head, but there were many little things such as this I looked for in vain in this particular adaptation.  Of much more consequence, though, are the changes and additions to the script one finds here.  As the film progresses, Dickens' story is at times drastically rewritten.  We are shown the death scene of Scrooge's beloved sister, non-Christmas scenes featuring the avaricious young duo of Scrooge and Marley (with the young Marley played by Patrick MacNee of future Avengers fame) making their way up in business, and other scenes Dickens never described directly.  Most galling of all, at least to me, is the view we have of Scrooge's one-time fianc&eacute;'s life as a mature woman; it could not be more different than the life Dickens describes to us.The looks at Christmases past seem to take undue time here, leaving the visions of present and future Christmas days too little time to achieve their utmost effect.  Even Tiny Tim is in a sense given the short shrift.  The film makes up for its shortcomings to some degree at the end, but even Christmas morning is marred by the insertion of a servant you won't find in Dickens' original story.  Alastair Sim makes a memorable Ebenezer Scrooge, but his performance falls far short of George C. Scott's later portrayal of Scrooge as Dickens envisioned him.  This 1951 version of A Christmas Carol is a notably good retelling of the Christmas classic, but I much prefer adaptations that present the story as it was written.	4.0	A good film marred by deviations from the original story	2003-12-20	5	2	3

This tale is the most retold, in part or in whole, of any piece of literature outside of the Bible and Shakespeare.  It has appeared in at least 25 film/animated versions, has been adapted to countless TV shows, and has been referenced even more than that.Alastair Sim's Scrooge is among the very best portrayals, and the film on the whole is the best film version I've seen.  I am reviewing the other versions individually, so I won't rehash them here, but this one is the best and my favorite film version.Give me this one along with Patrick Stewart's solo performance and I'd be a very happy camper.I've even grown fond of the errors in the film, like the stage hand that appears in the mirror reflection on Christmas morning.A tremendous cast and a wonderful atmospheric quality make this film so memorable and re-watchable.	5.0	Still the best of the best	2003-10-31	41	37	4

I had no choice but to purchase a copy of the best rendition of Dicken's beloved story. Alistair Sim's portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge is the prototype against whom all others must be compared to, and they all fall short of the mark. Sim manages to embody the spirit of the character, not merely play the part. The supporting cast is no less inspired, especially Michael Horndern as Marley's Ghost- he conveys the torment of a tortured soul like no other. If you find yourself trying to describe this wonderful movie to someone who's never seen it because you can't find it airing during the Christmas season, you owe it to yourself to buy it now.

The undertaker at the top of the stairs, Scrooge falling onto his grave stone, and his dying sister crying out that he take care of his nephew (Which he missed).

While the other variations are excellent in their own right (e.g., Reginald Owen's opening scene with his nephew or George C Scott's Ghost of Christmas Present), none compare to the transformation energetically espoused by Sim!  One of the best scenes is happy-go-lucky Sim boyishly chasing his maid to give her a Christmas present!For those who have read the book, the Sim's version is great, especially his time with the Ghost of Christmas Present and all the places they visit, seeing Christmas cheer and happiness across the globe (which is usually not in other versions).B&W; or color - the Sim's version is a keeper for the lovers and collectors of this timeless tale.	4.0	Oldie but a Goodie	2007-01-11	2	2	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3MAZM138KFVOW	D. Blackdeer	"""Scrooge"" is a movie adaptation of Charles Dickens' 1843 classic story of an old cold-hearted man who repents his callous philosophy on Christmas Day after being visited by four specters.  This version of many is arguably the toughest to succeed: the production and its cast flesh out Dickens' relatively short novel to a moving story about an old miser's spiritual resurrection.  Actor Alastair Sim is the centerpiece as Scrooge and his performance probably still remains on top of most others' portrayals.  His capture of Scrooge's remorse feels authentic and he does a masterful job in expressing the character's joy on Christmas Day.  This 1951 adaptation is interesting in that Scrooge's past is greatly expanded, it lends greater insight into his hard-hearted development as a businessman, and his resentment of the nephew whose birth contributed to the death of his sister.  Another addition is that his housekeeper, Ms. Dilber (Kathleen Harrison), plays a more visible role in the story, which amplifies Scrooge's personality change on Christmas Day.  The best part is Scrooge's reconciliation with his abused clerk, Bob Cratchet (Mervyn Johns), which so far has not been surpassed by later actors attempting to portray this scene.  While this is less loyal to Dickens' writing, it remains very effective in understanding Scrooge.Its comparison with the 1984 production starring George C. Scott and the 1999 version with Patrick Stewart is open to opinion.  The later productions enjoy beautiful movie sets and their portrayals of the specters are excellent.  The 1984 version boasts the scariest Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and features Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas Present, Anthony Walters who is almost perfect as Tiny Tim, and Nigel Davenport in a cameo as Scrooge's father.  The 1999 version is commendable for being the most loyal to Dickens' original story, and Joel Grey makes an excellent appearance as the Ghost of Christmas Past.  George C. Scott and Patrick Stewart are admirable in their respective roles, and both are excellent in portraying miserable old Scrooges, but they fall short of Sim's portrayal on Christmas Day.Another worthy mention is the 1970 musical version with Albert Finney as Scrooge.  A comparison is unfair since the story is adapted for musical performances.  Finney makes a good Scrooge, Kenneth Moore is excellent as the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Sir Alec Guinness stars as Jacob Marley's ghost.  This film features a unique sequence when Scrooge gets a taste of his future if he doesn't mend his ways, revealing the chain he's forged as told by Jacob Marley.An interesting follow up performance was given by Alastair Sim as Scrooge's voice in a Chuck Jones' animated film in 1971.  The feature is nicely animated and worth watching, but it's currently out of print and used VHS copies are expensive to purchase."	5.0	Scrooge 1951	2006-12-16	1	1	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1Q0DWEWELHG2	dbphoenix	As usual with films that are in the public domain, trying to figure out which one to buy can sometimes be a trial.There are two companies putting this one out: United Home and VCI.  VCI put out the 50th anniversary edition as well as the colorized version (which - now don't get confused - includes the black and white version).  United Home puts out the black and white version.  However, the packaging for the United Home and VCI versions are identical.  And the 50th anniversary edition is no longer available.So.  Given that the quality of whatever is shown on TV every year gets worse and worse, I took a shot at the VCI colorized/B&W; edition since they had also put together the 50th anniversary edition (shows a certain fondness for the film).  And since I had the opportunity to watch this film on TV on Christmas Eve, I'm in a position to make an almost side by side comparison.The result is that I am impressed with what VCI was able to do with this material.  I have no idea what their source material was.  And it doesn't look or sound as though they went through the whole restoration process.  However, the improvement in sound and picture is remarkable, maybe not 5s, but at least 3.5 to 4 on the sound, and at least 4 on the picture.  And given the price, this is far more than one might expect.They don't show these old films so much these days at Christmas time: Miracle on 34th Street, Pocketful of Miracles, White Christmas, Holiday Inn, and so on.  And when they do show them, they often use ratty old tapes or film stock.Therefore, buy these DVDs now in preparation for next year, if available, and see them when and as often as you like.  DVDs do get withdrawn from circulation, and you'll be sorry if you let the opportunity to pick up this version of A Christmas Carol go by.	4.0	Which one do I buy?	2002-12-27	18	16	2

(I've enjoyed seeing her in many different shows including MARY POPPINS and LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE).Also, this version of Dickens's ""immortal classic"" boasts more Christian themes than any of the others (including Albert Finney's).

Assuming that it was a result of the film being shot in the UK in 1951.  This Blu Ray transfer has changed that.  The black and white quality is excellent.  Yes, there is some grain, but that is expected when doing a transfer form the original 35mm negative.  Bottom line... short of a 4K transfer, this is as good as it gets.The package itself comes with the DVD version as well, which... for me... is unnecessary.  I will always watch the much cleaner Blu-Ray version.  The DVD version has a 4x3 transfer which is OK, and a 16x9 transfer, which is terrible... cutting off important parts of the frame, and making the entire film more blurry.Both the DVD and Blu Ray have the 2005 commentary for this film, which includes an expert discussing the production of this film, along with commentary from one of the original actors.If you are a fan of this film, and classic films in general, this is THE version to buy...	5.0	Great Blu Ray Transfer, A Must Own	2011-01-12	2	2	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1YW55S4UO3FVS	Denny from the Block	A fine film and a nice restoration, although even considering the era, the special effects were a bit cheesy. The Ghost of Christmas Past is just a guy with a black sheet over his head. Surely they could have done better with that costume. You could even see right through the sheet at one point. As for the package, I started watching the 16:9 version but, as I guessed, it was a zoomed version of the original 4:3 ratio, so tops of heads were constantly cut off. It drove me crazy and I ended up switching to the 4:3 version.	3.0	Christmas classic	2008-01-07	4	0	4
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AS1XVJZUDMJ6N	Deprima	This is one of my favorite movies for the holiday season. A few years back it was remastered and it looks unbelievable! They also added the colorized version in the set. This is great for all the children who tend not to like B&W movies. Last year when the blu-ray was announced, I was sure they would do the same thing, but they didn't. The blu-ray is B&W only. I realize that there are those of us who would prefer that nothing be done to make B&W movies into color! However, as I've said, some people really like it AND, You get BOTH B&W and Color. You don't have to watch the color one if you don't want to. I for one, will not be replacing my DVD until they offer me both B&W and Color versions! Why should I, my kids will only watch the color one. I do wish they'd get around to though, I'd love to see it on Blu-ray.	3.0	Color or Not	2011-09-13	57	18	39

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1622GN7F0NI0P	"Diana L. Blackwell ""Diana Blackwell"""	Despite some tinkering with the storyline, this is the best-ever film adaptation of Dickens's classic tale about a hard-hearted old miser who rediscovers his capacity for love and kindness one Christmas Eve when ghosts force him to re-examine his life.The poignant ghost of Christmas past dredges up Scrooge's memories, good and bad, reminding him of his early idealism and the bad choices that destroyed it. The jolly ghost of Christmas present shows Scrooge a vision of joy and abundance and the goodwill in most people's hearts--and ends with a chilling reminder of need in the midst of plenty. The terrifying ghost of Christmas yet to come forces Scrooge to confront his own mortality and to see the meaninglessness of his selfish life in the starkest possible terms. Sobbing with penitence, Scrooge vows to change his ways, and when he awakens on Christmas morning his joy produces film's most delirious fit of glee.The film is perfectly true to the spirit and even the language of the original book, and drives its moral home with powerful, unforgettable performances. Alistair Sim is magnificent as Scrooge.	5.0	Brilliant!	2003-12-29	5	4	1
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AAW91AYYHWCTW	Diane Kuhl	To fans of this movie it is no secret that this version of the often told tale is the best.  Why would you want the Blu-ray version?  The restoration is the best ever, and the extras add more enjoyment.  I first saw this version of Dickens story on television in the early seventies.  I fell in love with the performances and was always disappointed in the visual and when it was colorized...  Well that was too much.  I bought the dvd version when it came out and while it was ok it lacked the sheen that I saw in the film version.  With the Blu-ray the sheen is back.  As usual in 1080P the film grain is visible.  On the big screen you can enjoy a very filmic display.  I loved it and found it the most satisfying version to date.	4.0	The Best Version of this Classic	2009-12-09	2	0	2

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A22W47386ONRVP	Dibbs Martin	I purchased this blu-ray after last Xmas, so this is the first chance I have had to watch it. The video remastering is excellent and drastically reduces the artifacts that were previously visible in many of the special effects (I notice that they did not remove the brief accidental &#34;crew&#34; shot in the mirror in one scene, however). The special features are also very interesting, although skewed toward an American audience. It also appears that the subtitle text was provided by an American (or a very young...post decimalization... British person) since there are a number of mistakes, particularly regarding British idioms.  Incidentally, the use of the expression, &#34;Bob's your uncle,&#34; is an anachronism. It was not coined until the late 1800s, about 50 years after Dicken's wrote &#34;A Christmas Carol.&#34;My only complaint is that there are several seconds of audio dropout in the 5.1 soundtrack (not in the stereo track). This happens at the beginning of the scene where a revitalized Scrooge visits his nephew's house. I don't know if this is common to all copies or just peculiar to mine.	5.0	Audio dropout on Blu-Ray?	2013-12-24	0	0	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1FED7QM8Y48M2	Donald Maloney	I refer to the entire cast and crew as having made this magnificentversion as indeed a 'Labor of Love'. They all obviously cared deeplyabout bringing the best of Dickens to the big-screen and succeeded. Theoutdoor London 'sets' where several outdoor scenes of the offices ofMarley and Scrooge are shot are now long gone, real buildings from theVictorian era that survived the 'Blitz' of WW II. And the indoor setswere so well done, the flavor of the period well done.Alastair Sim as Scrooge is marvelous, a wonderful turn by this fineactor. But he is never better then when he awakens on Christmas Morning.Dancing, singing, doing gymnastics! The pure joy on his face when heinquires of Mrs. Dilber the housekeeper, played by Kathleen Harrison,'what day is today'? And she responds 'Christmas Day' and his elationthat he hasn't missed Christmas. Or the following scenes with thehousekeeper.  She thinks him quite mad! And why not? Hadn't he already,in his sleeping gown, done a hand-stand on a chair, and she, screaming,running out of his chambers with her apron over her face. When hecatches her up on the stairs and presses a golden coin in her hand shepulls away at first, wondering what he wants from her. His face showsher that all is well, a wonderful bit of acting in these two scenes bySim and Harrison.Wonderful acting throughout, good sets, well shot and lit, a memorable'Scrooge'/'A Christmas Carol'. I have the VHS version but now watch theLD. Avoid the colorized version, my opinion. The colors just never lookright. Besides, the sets and lighting were done for B & W. Also, the LDhas far superior contrast then VHS could ever offer. Those who don'thave LD, I'm certain the DVD will be a joy. Regardless, buy a copy, evenif only VHS. Remember that the Christmas season really only begins onChristmas Eve and runs to January 6. Plenty of time to buy and watchthis during the holidays. But see Leonard Maltin. Watch it anytime!One last thing, note the production error in the Christmas Morning scenewhen Sim as Scrooge is dancing merrily about his bedchamber. Fewreviewers ever mention this.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ	"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!"""	"Gene Shalit said, ""There have been at least eight movie versions [of A Christmas Carol] . . . but the single enduring version is the 1951 film starring Alastair Sim as Ebenezer Scrooge . . . an incomparable Christmas present.""  If this is your favorite version of A Christmas Carol, you should definitely buy this collector's edition.If you haven't seen this version, let me characterize it for you.  The film story closely follows the Dickens original with its emphasis on how Ebenezer Scrooge went from being a caring person who wanted to do good for others to someone who only cared about money, until four spirits (his dead partner, Jacob Marley; Christmas past; Christmas current; and Christmas future) visit him and scare Scrooge into reforming which he does on Christmas day.  The acting is often overdone, featuring overreactions of the sort that were popular in vaudeville and silent pictures.  Many of the actors seem miscast because they are quite plump and prosperous looking, even though they are supposed to be quite poor (this is especially true of Mervyn Johns who plays bob Cratchit, Scrooge's browbeaten, underpaid clerk.).  Naturally spirits require special effects and those are pretty primitive due to the year of the film.So why do people like it?  For me, the acting by Alastair Sim as old Scrooge, Patrick MacNee as young Jacob Marley, and Glyn Dearman as Tiny Tim were not only first-rate, they moved me in many ways.  Dickens's concept for the story is also pure genius.  There is also some wonderful signing of Christmas carols to get you in the mood.  It was nice to see such a good performance . . . especially if I didn't look too closely at the actors who didn't please me.As I watched the original version, I found myself thinking about the choices made by the producer, director, and scriptwriters for about the first 20 minutes.  But midway through the appearance of Jacob Marley in Scrooge's house, I found myself forgetting that I was watching a movie and just enjoyed the story from there.The experience reminded me of watching old black-and-white films on the tiny screen of the Brattle Theater near Harvard Square.  It was a good feeling.Next, I looked at the expanded black-and-white version that includes the ability to fill a wide screen.  This looked better, but I didn't like it as well.  It didn't take me back into the world of how movies were made in 1951 as successfully.Finally, I watched the colorized version . . . and hated it as I do almost all colorized black-and-white movies.  But what can you do?  Some people only want to watch color movies.After that, I watched the 1935 version of the movie and found the quality to be so poor that it annoyed me.  I gave up after about 15 minutes, thinking that I'll pick up there some other time.  The 1935 version has several good qualities:  the casting seems generally better, the contrasts between rich and poor are better developed, the sense of being in Dickens' London is stronger.Watching the 1935 version made me quite appreciative of the good work done by VCI Entertainment.  The images are clear, the lighting is consistent, the sound is understandable, and you don't feel like you are watching celluloid that's about to break.For those who love all the details, you'll enjoy the various special features which include:Before and after restoration comparisonPhoto and press book galleryCast biosOriginal trailersCommentaries by Marcus Hearn and George Cole about ""Spirit of Christmas Past,"" Alastair Sim, and George Minter (executive producer)Toss away your ""Bah, humbugs"" and get in the Christmas Spirit!"	5.0	More than Four Ways to Enjoy A Christmas Carol	2007-09-27	3	3	0

I've given the movie 5 stars, which is usually reserved for perfection, although this movie isn't ""perfect"" according to a few other reviews.  However, the movie transcends any mistakes it may have by the sheer force of Alastair Sim's performance.  He is/was a genius.  I don't think there will be another actor that can match his portrayal of Scrooge.This year, I've had a difficult time getting into the Christmas spirit.  The holidays are usually more stressful to me than a joy.  Last night I watched this movie on television, and my ""humbug"" attitude flew out the window.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2TXR85WQLE32N	D. S. Thurlow	"1951's British version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is perhaps the standard movie edition of the popular Charles Dickens classic.  Delivered in crisp black and white, with its focus on the original story and not on special effects, it delivers the haunting message of Dickens' novella in a way that the many subsequent versions do not.Alistair Sims is superb as Scrooge, easily and believably making the transition from grasping miser to a reformed man of Christmas spirit.  We see Ebenezer rise from neglected schoolboy to poor but generous clerk to rich and ambitious businessman to stingy miser before confronting the three Christmas Spirits who change his life.  His transformation is delivered with obvious physical joy, as he capers like a schoolboy and humbles himself to visit his disowned nephew.Brian Hurst's direction is direct and brisk, as an excellent cast steps through the story in just 86 minutes, without missing a single key element.  The Bob Crachitt family is especially well-cast, their sequences together fairly hum with genuine family feeling.Unlike many of the later versions, this production makes the point that Ebenezer Scrooge must be frightened into good sense by the three ghosts, not entertained by them.  At the same time, the ghosts are presented as the ultimately humane spirits they must be to give Scrooge hope for redemption.This movie is highly recommended to fans of a great Christmas classic and those looking for a Christmas movie that imparts a real message."	5.0	THE Standard...	2007-04-21	0	0	0

Although the George C. Scott attempt was very good, nothing can touch this one.  It not only captures the very essence of the story with expert structure, pacing, characterization, set design and costume -- but spirit as well.  Once you have seen the eccentric Alistair Sim in his tour de force portrayal of  Scrooge, it is very hard, if not impossible, to imagine the irascible Ebinezer in anyone else's skin.

Sim is incredibly funny, and the cast is incredible. But he seems to be more generous in this version than in any other version. He becomes exhilerated come Christmas morning after the 4 ghosts give Scrooge a visit. They take him through time, and everything fits. I especially like the ghost of Christmas Future. He is the most haunting and scary. He doesn't talk and has no face and show Scrooge of his death soon if he doesn't bring his act together. After waking up from his dream, he evn raises the salary of his maid. Plus, he gives his employee Christmas day off, unlike any other version. Tiny Tim and his family, Scrooge's nephew and niece, and Marley also all add a great touch in this film highly thought of by me.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2D3E7IXS000CV	"Duncan Mason ""ash"""	This film has been a part of my life since my earliest Christmas memories. My dad made it part of every Christmas morning when we were kids - after presents were opened of course. Forty years ago we watched in between watching the NASA moon mission. This black and white digital restoration is so much more satisfying than the colorized version previously available (though it can be found on the second disk). Watching it as a child I remember darkness all around the edges of the screen (which I must admit increased the spooky factor) but this version offers every single detail of the alternately lush and bleak production: the textures of the clothing, the details in the toyshop window, even a glimpse of the face of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1CTC1Y3HZWJCQ	"D. W. Davis ""YA Author"""	Still my favorite theatrical treatment of the Dicken's classic.  The colorized version included in the set was okay, though I thought some of the color choices seemed a bit off, particularly making the Ghost of Christmas Present's cloak red instead of green.Also, think the inclusion of the 1935 version from the London Studio is a good idea (though I already own it on a separate DVD)for those who may not realize for how long or how often this story had been interpretted on film.	5.0	Alistair Sim's A Christmas Carol	2010-12-28	0	0	0

All it really adds is ... colors that are pale and out of place, as with all colorized versions of any movies. The old B&W scenes add a touch of old London in the 19th century to the whole movie watching experience.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A26ZT7JP0WANNF	dxdefino@ssu.edu	Alastair Sim is the definitive characterization of the immortal Scrooge.  His performance is genuinely three dimensional showing the multiple aspects of the changing Scrooge.  This version also gives the very best description  of his past, laying a foundation for his actions.  I would however  recommened the colorized version.  It enhances the quality of the film and  makes some scenes (such as the wondering spirits) much clearer. My  apologies to the purists, but I like color.

What I received in my order from Amazon was totally unexpected. For the price I was expecting a washed out, grainy copy of my beloved childhood memory; but better than nothing. The set included two disks; one with the original b/w version re-mastered in different formats and the other with a colorized version (sacrilege!) and an earlier 1922 version which is a real gem. The video and audio quality in all four is excellent. The set arrived just in time for Christmas eve and viewing it after so many years flooded back those childhood memories of many Chrismases past.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A9L6L5H9BPEBO	Edwin C. Pauzer	"Spring and autumn are my favorite seasons, and I am in my glory as I have already swung back into golf action, but Christmas is a year-round preparation. Homage to Christmas stores must be observed, and bounties must be accumulated to ensure the next one is more festive than the last.But waiting for good Christmas stories to come to TV are as elusive as a hole-in-one. With not one showing of the 1951 production of Dickens' ""Christmas Carol,"" this past Christmas season I had had enough, and determined to remedy the situation. I bought this on DVD in its pure black and white version and one that has been colorized. I will be introducing this story to my great niece and great nephews as they plan their destruction of my home next Christmas.There are several productions of ""A Christmas Carol"" besides the 1951 version, one before and several since, but none of them shine for sheer acting, drama, and direction as this one does. It is the classic of classics. Use of an old ballad, ""Barbara Allen"" only adds to the emotion and enchantment of the story.For those who know nothing about a Christmas Carol, there is a miserly fellow named Ebenezer Scrooge (Alastair Sim) who has achieved wealth and power through cynicism of the human character while losing any empathy and warmth he may have had earlier in life in his climb toward success.It is Christmas Eve and his sleep becomes a nightmare with visits from the Ghosts of the Christmas Past, Present, and Future.  He gets to cower in front of his dead partner who warns him to change his ways. He gets to see the suffering of his faithful and timid employee, Bob Cratchit (Mervyn Johns). Finally, he gets to see the future and what people thought of him. What effect will the dreams have on a man so disposed to contempt for the poor and wretched? In order to find out, you will have to watch this movie. The book is also available.A phenomenal cast rounds out the story that is said to be the truest to the masterpiece novella. The acting has the power to bring tears to your eyes as you empathize with their misery and joy. Alastair Sim's performance makes him an acting icon. It is so moving, that this ""Christmas Carol"" is not only considered to be the best version, but the very best of Christmas stories and the Christmas spirit.Don't miss the story, or the spirit."	5.0	The True Spirit of Christmas	2010-04-22	5	4	1

Of them all, this is my favorite.  The fact that it also features John Steed (Patrick Macnee) is a huge plus.  In this one, I appreciate the attempt to maintain most of the classic story by Dickens.  But, there are some additions and some notable omissions in this version too.  Still, it's the best of the lot.  In particular, I love the duplicitous charwoman played to perfection by Kathleen Harrison.  (Although I still can't understand what she thought she had to gain by throwing her apron over her head to escape the clutches of the reformed Scrooge.)In this version there's definitely more grave than gravy to be had.	5.0	"""I'll retire to bedlam."""	2013-12-19	2	2	0

For example, the home of the impoverished Bob Cratchitt is more luxurious than that of most viewers', and, miserable sort though Scrooge was, he did NOT put Fezziwig out of business. With this said, I must admit the film is generally quite delightful.Sim &quot;fleshes out&quot; the character of Scrooge (who, in this version, happily is allowed to be a redeemed miser - there is none of the &quot;psychology&quot; that would flavour some later remakes), making all aspects of the narrative highly believable. Excellent acting and a general period flavour are a delectable and enduring combination, and one even a purist finds quite addictive.	4.0	Wonderful acting - themes come through	2000-12-05	6	2	4

This is not just the best telling of Dickens tale, but a classic film for all time, all seasons. Alistair Sim is incomprable as Scrooge. All the actors are wonderful, they so perfectly convey the feeling of 19th century London. Look for Patrick McNee, who later gained fame as ""John Steed"" in the wonderful ""Avengers"", as the young Jacob Marley, and Hermione Baddely, who was an accomplished stage actress and favorite of Tennessee Williams, she also later played ""Mrs. Naugatuct"",the tipsy housekeeper, on t.v.'s ""Maude"", as Mrs. Bob Cratchet. The only reason to see any of the other versions is to reinforce just how superior this one is, though the Reginald Owen and George C. Scott versions are respectable. I found the Patrick Stewart version abominable, as expected. This is too good a film to be watched only once a year, it will transport you so realisticly to Olde London. And the storys lessons of forgiveness and remorse are just as meaningful now as then. Oh, not to ruin the illusion, but in the scene when Scrooge awakens Christmas Day, after having had his ""epiphany"", watch as he's looking in the mirror, as he tells his housekeeper about his ordeal. You will see, reflected in the mirror, the reflection of a modern-day (circa 1950) person, more than likely one of the crew. Don't know if this bit of trivia is common knowledge, but I find it interesting. Also, though Simm is only known by most for his role as Scrooge, check out his very funny ""St. Trinians"" films, where he plays headmaster at a boys school. A wonderful, different look at this great actor. This heartwarming film will be THE Christmas classic for all time.POSTSCRIPT!!!I just noticed I reviewed the ""colorized"" version. DANGER!! DANGER!!

The 1901 version can be found elsewhere.  I have been looking for the 1914 version for years, but it has been held captive by BFI.

"Like most Americans of a similar age I grew up watching this movie on TV during the Christmas season along with all the other Christmas movies and TV specials, but as a boy I wasn't especially impressed with it.  It was in black and white; the film was noticeably dirty and scratched; there wasn't much singing, and worst of all, it wasn't a cartoon!  However, in a one-TV house you watched what your parents wanted to watch, or you did without so I remember watching parts of this version many times over the years though never all the way through until I received this DVD.  Though it wasn't my cup of tea at the time, even as a child I recognized the power of Alistair Sim's definitive performance, one of the best of his distinguished career (though personally I still prefer his dual parts tour-de-force in The Belles Of St. Trinian's which I believe is also long over due for a film restoration and a 2-disk Ultimate Collector's Edition treatment.  HINT!  HINT!  Oh, HINT!)The first thing you will notice is the extraordinary beauty of the film restoration; it literally looks brand new!  You have a choice of two aspect ratios: ""full screen"" and ""widescreen"", though the ""widescreen"" in this case didn't add back too much missing material at the edges.  (It is intended more for widescreen TVs, but it makes it easier to read subtitles if you use them.)  Seeing the movie from start to finish also convinced me, if I had any doubts left, that this is the one and only film version.  Other than giving Yet Another distinguished actor the chance to sink his teeth into this magnificent role, why bother to remake it?The extras are primarily of interest to film buffs.  The audio commentary is mostly George Cole (Young Scrooge) reminiscing with Marcus Hearn about his own long and distinguished career; on more than one occasion Marcus asks George a specific question about the film that George has no knowledge or recollection of, which leads to an embarrassing pause before Marcus prods George into talking about something he is more familiar with -- his friendships with Sim and several of the other performers.The unrestored (1989) colorized version is worth watching if only to remind yourself why colorization wasn't such a hot idea after all, but you will want to watch the bookend spoken pieces by Patrick Macnee, of ""The Avengers"" fame, who speaks of his love for this story and this version of it while utterly failing to mention his minor part in it (Young Marley) as his screen debut.  The unrestored (1935) version of ""Scrooge"" included on the same disk will mostly have you questioning the sanity of those movie reviewers who compared it FAVORABLY with the Sim version when the latter first came out.Finally, it might be worthwhile to reflect upon just exactly what was the ""sin"" of Scrooge and Marley?  It wasn't being moneylenders, that most useful of professions to the non-wealthy of any time period, providing them the opportunity to purchase big ticket items, like a house, with the opportunity to enjoy them while they are still paying for them.  Nor was it turning an honest profit.  Friendly old Fezziwig is favorably compared with Scrooge in many ways, but in the end Fezziwig let down the employees he cared for by failing to maintain a business profitable enough to continue to employ them.  It was rather their all consuming, blasphemously worshipful lust for money, and, particularly in Scrooge's case, the unnecessary cruelty and heartlessness with which he conducted business and lived his life, making everyone around him (and arguably even himself) miserable.""A Christmas Carol"" has long proven a stumbling block to devout Christians because of its seeming endorsement of being saved by good works, but IMHO that is because they mistake Marley's and Scrooge's true spiritual condition.  If you consider Marley and Scrooge as being (extremely) backslidden Christians rather than as being unsaved non-Christians, the theology of the story now makes perfect sense.  While it is impossible for anyone to ""earn"" his salvation by ""good"" works, it being a free gift from God, it is also impossible for a Christian once truly saved to ever ""lose"" his salvation by ""bad"" works.  However, such a Christian can forfeit any and all rewards for good service above and beyond simple salvation by ""bad"" behavior, which would appear to describe Marley's condition, and ""bad"" behavior can eventually lead to God deciding that the best thing to do is to shorten this life so you'll do less damage, which appears to be what Scrooge is being warned about.  Christians were specifically and repeatedly commanded by Jesus to behave so much better towards others as to call attention to the reason for it -- their religious faith.  Christians whose behavior is actually worse than that of the average non-Christian are ""asking for it"" and certainly cannot count on a divine visitation of the sort that 2-by-4-ed Ebenezer Scrooge back upon the straight and narrow."	4.0	"The Definitive Scrooge in the Definitive Adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"""	2007-10-14	6	1	5
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2Z1K2I2EYSKFA	FrontPage	At the bottom of this review, there is a tiny bit of trivia, and I hope you'll like what I discovered. It's just some trivial tidbit stuff, that's all... So now, the review:If you are changing to the DVD format from VHS, throw away your OLDER VHS tape and purchase this! The much older VHS tapes hadn't been remastered from the original print, which was discovered in England. The picture quality is so much better than those older 3rd- and fourth- generation tapes and broadcasts we've seen where everything seems like &quot;Scrooge&quot; was filmed in a fog. The contrast in the DVD is sharp and brilliant. The darks are deep yet the whites aren't at all washed out. Trust me, purchase the remastered version (I'm sure they also have released a remastered version in VHS, but I have converted to DVD).The DVD has something for everyone, God bless us all. I watched the colorized version, but it seems... colorized. It simply doesn't have that warm, saturated, natural tone of movies filmed with color stock. Some may feel that younger people might in some way enjoy the colorized movie better, but try showing it to them in B&amp;W first. Give them the chance to see the original which has stood the test of time, and for good reason. I still admire any DVD producer that takes advantage of the versatility of the options that can be pressed into the DVD format, and VCI Entertainment gave the consumer the choice. The black &amp; white version is on one side, and just flip the double- sided disc over for the color version.There are added features including a Max Fleischer cartoon of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. Although it was filmed in Technicolor, there was a very noticable color shift that occured in the original print. The audio wasn't that great, either. And honestly, it's not nearly as enjoyable as the animated puppet version that we used to see on CBS television with the Charlie Brown cartoon.Also included is an introduction by Patrick Macnee, who you remember as John Steed in the TV series &quot;The Avengers.&quot; I didn't understand at first why he was introducing the movie until I found that he played a bit part in &quot;Scrooge (Macnee failed during his introduction to say whom he played).&quot; So, I'll tell you:  Look for him as the young Jacob Marley, early in the film, when Scrooge (Alastair Sim) is guided by the Spirit of Christmas Past (Michael Dolan). There is a 4- page color pamphlet included. One page shows a repro of an cute, yet quirky little original movie poster. Another has chapter stop and movie info. The inside pages are devoted to other DVD movie titles.Okay, now the tidbit! What people liked about &quot;Scrooge&quot; is that the characters produced some more spontaneously funny moments that break the otherwise dark and gloomy tone of the story. Those of you who have watched &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; have probably noted the similarities that I will describe! There are two characters in the &quot;Scrooge&quot; movie that I could have sworn mimicked two other characters in a different flick. The maid, Mrs. Dilber (Kathleen Harrison) in &quot;Scrooge&quot; seemed so much like the maid, Minnie (Una O'Connor) in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein.&quot; Watch the similarities in how the characters play off each other in the different movies (Mrs. Dilber with Mr. Stretch, the undertaker [Ernest Thesiger] in &quot;Scrooge;&quot; Minnie with Dr. Pretorius [also played by Thesiger!]) I actually just discovered that Thesiger played in both movies! Maybe the producer and/or director of &quot;Scrooge&quot; tapped some ideas from the light moments between Mrs. Dilber and Mr. Stretch from the Frankenstein flick, but it worked. (I love that name, &quot;Stretch!&quot;) Enjoy.	5.0	B&amp;W &amp; Color in this DVD, a must for the family film library	2003-09-29	20	18	2
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3QMCBIX8X4IQH	fussmucker	I think this version of Dickens' classic is by far the best ever made, and there have been quite a few.  Alistair Sim was to Scrooge what Yul Brynner was to the King of Siam...imitated but never equalled.  I have been watching this film since I was a boy and have never tired of it.  The enhanced video is superb, something we never saw on broadcast TV.  I have a copy on VHS tape which I never looked at, having instead watched it on broadcast TV during the holidays and I'm sure the video quality is nowhere nearly as good as this.  Also, I was pleased to see that the film had not been colorized...some films are just best left alone in that regard...If Ted Turner ever gets his hands on it, that's the end of that!  I work evenings and play around on my computer until very late when I get home.  When I found the film on Amazon, on BLU-RAY DVD no less, I couldn't believe my good fortune and wasted no time in ordering it at some unholy hour when others were asleep.  Incidentally, I was surprised at how quickly it was delivered, two, perhaps three days...GREAT JOB AMAZON!	5.0	A Timeless Classic Made Even Better	2013-01-14	3	1	2
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AQS2OPXU1L0B2	GABRIELE GILBERT	The classic version of a christmas carol also known as scrooge(originally titled).Alastair sims portrayal of scrooge is without a doubt the best of all,an outstanding 1951 gem which knocks out all others before and after.This is vci's third time to rerelease the 1951 classic.now on disc one we have two versions,one being full screen which shows it has been restored and cleaned up than the previous two releaseS.the scratches and sometimes frame skipping and even soundtrack has been cleaned up.Now on the other hand the widescreen version is a dissapointment it is the full frame with black bars on the top and bottom thus giving you less of a picture,when you compare both features you will notice the difference.Now on disc two is even more of a let down.disc two contains the color version and the 1935 version of a christmas carol.the color version is the same one used in the previous editions from vci so there is no restoration on the color version and even has the introduction from patrick mcnee from the first editions from vci.the 1935 version is the short version and not a good copy at all.But what you do get is the full frame restoration of the 1951 classic on the first disc which is the reason to upgrade this gem and the george cole interview is also an added attraction as well as other features.So it has its good and bad,i prefer this upgrade over my two old releases i have.This still deserves a 5 star thus giving us more on this classic in a 2 disc set.	5.0	THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION OF A CHRISTMAS CAROL THE GOOD AND THE BAD	2007-10-30	4	4	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A12GPIUFLWEWCS	Gamin' Gran	Since I was a child, I've watched this rendition of Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol, which is actually entitled Scrooge. As a child, it frightened me more than any horror movie (but I watched horror movies in the 50's and 60's.) When I had children of my own, I shared this version, and others, with them, pointing out that Alistair Sim's portrayal of Scrooge was by far the most superior, in that his metamorphosis is entirely believable! In addition to Sim's incomparable performance as Scrooge, this version also boasted, in my opinion, the best Tiny Tim (Glyn Dearman) and Robert Crachit (Mervyn Johns), and a very young Patrick MacNee who would reappear years later as the cerebral half of The Avengers! I would whole-heartedly recommend this film to anyone who truly prizes the real meaning of Christmas. While I personally would not share this with very young children, I have viewed it with own children and grandchildren when they were 8+ years of age.	5.0	Best Christmas Film Ever!	2010-01-03	1	1	0

This &quot;50th Anniversary Edition&quot; claims to be made from the original film, and certainly it seems to be of higher quality than the other versions I've seen on tape or DVD.The &quot;extras&quot; on this disc are not much.  But then, I didn't want the extras, I just wanted a clearer version of this classic movie.  This edition delivers that.There is one thing that I don't know if was due to my DVD player, or the DVD itself.  It seems that if you start up the DVD, it will keep playing the movie (over and over again) until you stop it.

Scott version.  Each has its charms and idiosynchrasis.The Ghost of Jacob Marley in the 1951 edition is superbly done with many of the original Dicken's lines used or paraphrased.  However the 1984 Ghost was even better, particularly, in my opinion, when he says&quot; Man of the worldly mind do you beleive in me or not?&quot;The character of Scrooge himself is portrayed admirably by both Sim and Scott although Scott plays him more arrogantly it seems and therefore more lifelike.  I love his &quot;arguing&quot; with the spirits who &quot;sometimes even (I) forget the rules, after all I don't come around that often.&quot; ( Ghost of Christmas Present)The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is done the best in the 1951 edition.  Note if you look carefuly at the scene with Scrooge at the window of the Crathcits you can actually see the face of the actor behind the black guaze.The Ghost in the 1984 was perhaps more frightening but that screeching sound he made when he moved and the lightning flashed when the scene changed were annoying.	5.0	A Holiday Tradition	2002-12-13	14	10	4

Sims acting is superb, the  dialogue is &quot; Dickens &quot;and each character is potrayed by people  who love theather.  These actors are exceptional.  Scrooge's maid, shown  announcing Marley's death, selling Scrooge's belongings and recieving a  gift from Scrooge, shows a range that not many actors are asked to today.  When Scrooge realizes that &quot;The spirits have done it all in one  night&quot; and he starts dancing, you can not help but to get happy as  well.

Every character, no matter how small, is played by an English character  actor.  It's hard to imagine how the acting could be improved upon--it's  that good.

Perkins ""wide reader"""	"SPOILERS FOLLOWFor years, I resisted and criticized this 1951 film of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol.""  In my opinion, the movie was a vastly overrated piece of fluff from another era.  I've been watching this film particularly closely this holiday season, and my opinion is definitely changing.  Starring Alastair Sim, Mervyn Johns, and Hermione Baddeley, this is a very creative adaptation.The screenplay by Noel Langley(who handled the same duties in a co-writing capacity with Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf for ""The Wizard of Oz"") is extremely faithful to Charles Dickens while throwing in audacious bursts of originality.  For instance, (SPOILER) I love the expanded roles for both Fezziwig and Jacob Marley.  This is both logical from a storytelling point of view, and a realistic expansion for the characters considering their respective significant impacts on Scrooge's life.Mr. Sim offers a surprisingly understated performance as Ebenezer Scrooge, doing as much with body language as with declarations.  Look at his hand subtly shake with anger and frazzled nerves as he dismisses his nephew Fred from his office.  He intuits that Scrooge may not only be angered by the nephew's invitation, but that it threatens to uncover repressed emotions.Mervyn Johns walks a fine line to give a very credible performance as Bob Cratchit.  He is ultimately extremely good, reading mostly oppposite Sim and Hermione Baddeley, although the ingenious screenplay somewhat expands his role as well.  As solid as the performances are, the expanded screenplay truly vaults this film into the masterpiece category.  I'll give few details truly away in this review, but the screenplay may even represent an improvement over Dickens' plotting for this novel.In closing, I'll say that I grew up adoring the 1984 George C. Scott portrayal of Scrooge, and I still do.  But, my perspective is permanently changing as it relates to this acclaimed 1951 film.  I regard the two films now collectively as being equally definitive, their respective Scrooges products of twin masters who each inherently understand the character.  This movie was and is legendary because every ounce of its runtime expresses creativity at a very high level.  Highly recommended."	5.0	I recant my initial position:  Alastair Sim is exceptional, and audacious creativity puts this over the top	2011-12-16	2	2	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AFT8AGQQRQ52V	Grumpy Young Doc	This version of Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is absolutely superior to all other attempts. Due courtesy to George C. Scott and Mickey Mouse, to name but two renditions that come up lame compared to this classic- but what arrogance to think their slick and silly remakes could stand in for this calssic? The bummer for us all, and I truly mean a real bummer- this wonderful 1951 Alastair Sim version was shot in black and white. Worse, it was shot in BAD black and white. I heard it was actually made for English TV. Adding insult to our cinematic injury, the surviving print doesn't seem to be very good either. Perhaps it was a second or third generation copy that survived from that time? Given all that, however, this version is so spectacular, so real, and so emotionally and spiritually true and authentic, that it still gets aired regularly each Christmas season. It is still thrilling to behold, even in its blurry splendor! Again, compared with this, all other versions are poor shadows. They can even seem annoying! Watching Alastair Sim's Scrooge in the years 2001+ will just have to be one of those profound disappointments of history-- like finding a newly discovered Shakespeare play with some of the pages missing. If this had been a pristine, crystal clear color print, no one would even dare to remake the story. As it is, we can only tsk-tsk at the wannabes, and marvel at the artistic magic that manages to filter through from 1951's bad print to us all in the present day.	5.0	A Low-Tech Masterpiece; Wish The Surviving Print Was Better!	2001-12-31	6	1	5

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A32O5FZH994CNY	"G. Ware Cornell Jr. ""anotherlawyer"""	"If Bill Murray was movie history's worst Scrooge, and he was, then Alastair Sim was its greatest. The problem with Ebenezer Scrooge is that he is such a great character that actors envitably want to put their interpretation to the fore and leave the Dickensonian essence quietly alone within the pages of A Christmas Carol.Scrooge is a redemptive character not because he was visited by three ghosts and scared straight, but rather because he was a lost soul who found his way home. He was at rock bottom good, but had grown up in a world where kindness and virtue were chump values. Ebenezer's raw ambitition caused him to bury his essential nature deep within him, and he came to believe he was just as the world saw him.Scrooge is a very much the kind of businessman dominates the contemporary Western world...an early day Gordon Gecko. Dickens has plans for him however, and he is made to see who he was, and what he has become.Sim's genius lies in his ability to transform his character. The scene at the offices where the 19th century equivalent of the United Way is illustrative. Told of the needs of the poor, Scrooge asks, ""Why? Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?"" Scrooge supports these institutions through his taxes, and sees no need of doing anything more. What he wants is clear, ""I want to be left alone.""Because Alastair Sim plays Charles Dickens' Scrooge and not his own and because Brian Desmond Hurst the director saw the bitter social commentary that lay within this fable, this remains the most satisfying film of the classic.Now a few words about the DVD. It comes in several formats...a restored B&W; version, a 16:9 B&W; version, and a colorized version. A bonus of a 1935 version staring Seymour Hicks is included, but not the only other comparably great Scrooge, Reginald Owen from the 1938 edition. The colorized version takes away from Hurst initially dark vision, and is a distraction. The film was originally shot in a 1.33:1 aspect ration, and the 16:9 widescreen would seem ill adapted to it. However it proves to be little distraction on a widescreen monitor."	5.0	The quintessential Scrooge	2007-11-19	2	2	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1S1JC7LTBZAH2	Hal Jordan	"Many people believe this Alastair Sim version of A Christmas Carol is the best film adaptation of Dickens's story.  ""Too good to be shown only at Christmas"" is film critic Leonard Maltin's much-quoted judgment.  Released in Britain in 1951 under the title ""Scrooge,"" the film offers fine performances by Sim and a number of other first-rate British actors of the time. The most recognizable of these other actors to modern American audiences is probably Peter Bull, who went to play many film roles, including that of the Russian ambassador in Dr. Strangelove.  Bull narrates the film and has a small role as a business colleague of Scrooge's.  The production values -- including the special effects involving Jacob Marley's ghost and the spirits -- are fine, especially for a 1951 film.  Overall, though, I still think the television version starring George C. Scott is the definitive filming of this story.  That version benefits from being in color, with better effects, and a terrific performance by Scott. Interestingly, Clive Donner, who was the editor on this film, directed the Scott version.This Blu-ray edition is an improvement on the versions previously available and is certainly much better than the prints typically shown on television.  I found it crisp and clean, although a few times some of the faces were a bit washed out -- a fairly common occurrence, I think, in Blu-ray versions of older black and white films.  In addition, there were several times where there was bit of blurring when one of the actors moved rapidly.  I don't know whether this was a fault of the transfer or of my Blu-ray player, although I can't recall experiencing it with other films I've viewed on this player.  Leonard Maltin provides an interesting introduction, which puts the film in historical context and offers brief comparisons to other versions.  A British cultural historian offers commentary on various aspects of the film, and an American film distributor discusses attempts to distribute the film in the United States.  Apparently, the film was considered too dark to be promoted as a family film and ended up receiving only a limited release in the United States.If you haven't seen this film, you definitely should.  If you are familiar with it, but don't own a copy, this is the version to buy."	4.0	Best available version of this classic film	2013-12-13	0	0	0

This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I'm going to relate.""And so begins A CHRISTMAS CAROL, an atmospheric tale of morality and ghosts. It's a bit weird viewing this film when it's not even Christmas yet; it seems near sacrilegious somehow. But there's no denying its quality and longevity. It's a movie for the ages and the definitive version of Charles Dicken's enduring holiday fable. Wait - I wasn't the first to say this? Cor!Nevertheless, bulgy-eyed and crooked-of-teeth Scottish actor Alistair Sim, with this celebrated performance, attains cinematic immortality even as he exiles onto a lower tier all other portrayals of Ebenezer Scrooge. Other adaptations boast the likes of George C. Scott, Patrick Stewart, Albert Finney, Michael Caine, and even Bill Murray. Sim leaves them in his dust, their heads hanging low. Sim invests his character with such an aura of petty vitriol and resolute bitterness. Scrooge's treatment of his fellow men couldn't be more coldhearted and dismissive. That we speedily come to long for such a soured man to discover penitence and thus regain his soul is a nod to Sim's acting.Assuming that everyone knows the story, this then is the briefest of recaps: Old miserly sinner Ebenezer Scrooge starts out by gruffly proclaiming ""And Christmas, sir, is a humbug!"" But, after four unsettling haunts are visited upon him - in which moments he is shown the horrific tapestry that was/is/and will be his life - he remorsefully declares, ""I'm not the man I was."" And then, in an exhibition of spontaneous glee, he stands on his head. As an astounded little boy, I had marked that scene as the clear turning point which indicated that the codgery reprobate had indeed reformed. The transformation of Ebenezer from despicable humbug to merry Uncle Scrooge is a startling thing, and Sim pulls it off with aplomb.Suffice to say, this 1951 version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL (a film that's sometimes called SCROOGE), along with other classic holiday fare such asIt's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition),Miracle on 34th Street (Special Edition), andHoliday Inn (Special Edition), is a must-see in my household come each December. But Alistair Sim is not the sole reason to see this piece of celluloid; his is not the only brilliance manifested here. The rest of the cast perform remarkably. Pile on to the superlative acting the wonderful adaptation with its delicious supernatural elements, the moody, nerve-jangling score, the elegant, beautifully remastered black and white cinematography (delightfully evoking Victorian England), and the excellent pacing of the film...and, well, all these factors combine to make this picture an essential and unforgettable movie experience.Let's get into the bonus stuff. A CHRISTMAS CAROL: THE ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITION is a lush and handsome 2-disc dvd product. Disc 1 offers restored B & W versions of this film in two specs (in the original 4 x 3 and also in 16 x 9, enhanced for widescreen monitors), along with film commentary by Marcus Hearn and actor George Cole, who both provide insights and reminiscences. Extras feature subtitle options in English or Spanish, audio options including an English narrative for the blind (very cool, and also applies to Disc 2), and cast bios.Going to Disc 2, we can opt for the same A CHRISTMAS CAROL, but in color, or the solid 1935 version with Seymour Hicks as Scrooge. Further extras include trailers for SCROOGE and A CHRISTMAS CAROL (both the same movies). Video featurettes are ""Spirit of Christmas Past"" - 15 minutes of Marcus Hearn interviewing actor George Cole, who played Scrooge as a young man in the 1951 version; ""Richard Gordon Remembers George Minter and Renown Pictures"" - a 20 minute interview with Richard Gordon, who helped to fund and distribute the film; ""Charles Dickens - His Life and Times""; ""Before and After Restoration""; and a photo gallery. But, while I dug the various permutations in format of the 1951 film (the original, the widescreen, the colored) and even thought the 1935 movie interesting, I couldn't get into the featurettes, finding the interviews a bit too stodgy and dry. Doubtless, others will find them interesting enough.Alistair Sim was a great character actor who made other noteworthy films. It's just that he was so good in A CHRISTMAS CAROL that this role now overshadows his other works. But if you liked what you saw here and are curious to see more of Alistair Sim, I definitely recommend the excellent wartime thrillerGreen for Danger - Criterion Collection, Hitchcock'sStage Fright, and the comedy The Belles Of St. Trinian's (wherein Sim is part time in drag)."	5.0	"""I must stand on my head...

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1HD5KASZ7F36S	History Man	"There are two superb film adaptations of this Dickens classic; this one and the 1984 TV film starring George C. Scott.  Both do justice to the original novella far beyond any other dramatizations.  However, it is this 1951 British version that got there first and no doubt inspired the 1984 remake.  Both Alastair Sim and Scott breath life into the character of Scrooge and make him a three-dimensional personality whose life and fate take on far greater meaning than they do in the hands of other actors who have taken on this role.  Sim, of course, became the definitive Scrooge by first taking the character seriously and by portraying Scrooge as more than a simplistic cardboard cutout.  For those of us who were raised on this version of the film, Sim will always ""be"" Scrooge.  That does not detract from Scott's performance at all and he was quoted as saying he knew from the start that he could never hope to match Sim's effort. Nonetheless, he succeeded in carving out his own highly credible, compelling portrait of Scrooge which stands beside that of Sim's, like two magnificent paintings sharing the same wall.  Both films should be enjoyed and appreciated as the fine, individual achievements that they are and both will stand as ""definitive"" for a very, very long time.  We are the richer for having such a marvelous choice."	5.0	Still the Standard	2002-11-25	234	217	17

The set comes wrapped in a lovely cardboard slipcover, lavishly decorated with screenshots from the film, and adorned with sparkly, three dimensional snowflakes.  Inside is a clear, double keepcase that opens to reveal a festive winter scene behind the discs.Disc 1 includes two versions of the film: the standard 4x3 version, and a 16x9 version for widescreen TVs.  Both have been painstakingly restored by Point 360, so they look and sound spectacular...for a movie that was made in 1951.  There's also a full-length commentary with Marcus Hearn and George Cole (who played the young Ebenezer Scrooge); as well as brief, written biographies of Alastair Sim; Kathleen Harrison; Jack Warner; Brian Desmond Hurst; Mervyn Johns; and Hermione Baddeley.Disc 2 contains the very undesirable (and ugly) computer colorized version, with an introduction by Patrick MacNee (the young Jacob Marley), which includes the option of a descriptive audio track for the blind.  But wait!  There's MORE!  VCI has also thrown in, at no extra charge, the 1935 adaptation of Scrooge, directed by Henry Edwards and starring Sir Seymour Hicks.  Plus, you get a veritable cornucopia of special features, such as: two movie trailers; a photo gallery with a TON of Christmas Carol pictures; a before and after restoration comparison; an interview with George Cole (which is mostly redundant if you've listened to the commentary on disc 1); a six-minute biography of Charles Dickens; and an interview with Richard Gordon (who helped get A Christmas Carol distributed in the United States), where you'll learn all about producer George Minter and his Renown Pictures.I think what really makes the 1951 version of A Christmas Carol stand out as the best is the powerful and moving way in which Alastair Sim portrays Scrooge's joyous transformation from a coldhearted miser to a cheerful giver.  It should serve as a reminder to all of us to be kind and generous to one another, not just at Christmastime, but all the time.  It should also serve as a reminder to always brush your teeth after consuming those holiday goodies, or else you might wind up with teeth like Mr. Scrooge's.  Also, please do not allow your children to hold and caress a raw, unfrozen turkey carcass, as the Cratchit children do in this film, or else they might wind up contracting salmonella...or worse, campylobacter!Now nip along smartly and place your order while the pudding is still singing in the copper, `cause this merry DVD set is as good as gold and better!

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A367HVAVZJJSB1	Irish Critic	"Over the decades there have been many screen adaptations of this timeless classic by Charles Dickens. The story is sometimes acted out with levity, as in ""Black Adder's Christmas Carol"" and Michael Caine's excellent 1992 production ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"", et al. When reviewing Alastair Sim's 1951 film I feel it's more appropriate to restrict my comparisons to the other 'serious' adaptations as well as to the original novel.The 1984 George C. Scott production boasts some excellent acting but leaves out much of the storyline. The exact reverse is true of the 1999 Patrick Stuart version, where more of the original story is retained but Stuart is unconvincing as Scrooge. Overall, this 1951 Alastair Sim adaptation is the best I've seen yet - especially since it was 'colourised' in 1979. In fact, this DVD boxed-set contains both! It also includes a pretty dated 1936 effort called ""Scrooge"", starring Seymour Hicks. Cinema made enormous strides in those 15 years and Hicks's treatment can't hold a candle to Sim's 1951 classic.There's one aspect of the Alastair Sim version that's worthy of mention. Scenes and dialogue not found in the original text are inserted in order to ""flesh out"" the story. In some cases, this can actually enhance the viewing experience (and I say that as something of a literary purist). For example, there's a scene where Scrooge & Marley - both aged thirty-something - offer to pay their employer's debts from personal savings. This is in exchange for an option to buy up 51% of the company's shares. Dickens's novel contained no such narrative, yet the scene helps to paint a picture of the partners' gradual descent from the benignity of honest ambition into the malignancy of personal greed.But often with a classic novel, when you add something to it you take away. This is especially true of the farcical scene where Jacob Marley appears to be repenting on his death-bed. The fact that Marley died unrepentant is crucial to the storyline! A poor piece of directing in my view.Overall, I still highly recommend this video. Were it not for the Marley death-bed anomaly I'd have awarded it the full 5 stars."	4.0	Overall my favourite screen adaptation	2008-11-03	1	1	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3IHWMYPB2V55N	Jack	I love this movie in its original black and white.  My opinion, without doubt, the best of all the filmed CHRISTMAS CAROLS.  Alastair Sim is the Scrooge for the ages.  So the question is, does colorization make this film better or improve it in any way? The answer is no.  It can't be improved because it's already perfect. But colorization certainly does add an element of fun in watching it after repeated b&w; viewings.  And if colorization gets younger viewers to watch this wonderful movie, than it's more than a gimmick.  It's a tool to encourage those not familiar with the film classics to give them a look.As far as the actual colorization goes, I really don't see much improvement in the process in all the years it's been around.  Having said that, this film sort of lends itself to the process however because of the locale and nature of the storytelling so the faded, less than crisp colors don't detract from the picture and can almost seem like they might belong.  More important than the colorization, is the added feature in this package of the widescreen presentation of the black and white version which looks terrific!So if you are a fan of the movie and would like to see what it looks like colorized (and I admit I always do like to see the colorization of the classics just for the fun of it) or even if you would like to see the b&w; version in widescreem (I'm really not sure how they achieved this cause it wasn't filmed in widescreen but looks here like it really was:  no distortion or zoom-like cutoffs at all!) or if you are a collector of anything A CHRISTMAS CAROL, then I happily recommend this version to you.  Happy Holidays!PS:  For us collectors of A CHRISTMAS CAROL, this packaging is pretty nifty, too!	5.0	Color, black and white, black and blue...great in any format!	2009-11-09	1	1	0

We bought this to replace our original video VHS tape, which we had watched for so many years as a Christmas tradition. We had worn that one out & it broke! We could not believe the difference in the sharpness & brightness - how amazing and beautiful the colors appeared, compared to our other version.  WHAT A TREAT! It was great to view all the background interviews & information too. We always anticipate seeing this wonderful old film every Christmas: (the 1951 version with Alastair Sim - the other versions are not as true to the original Dicken's novel). We almost don't want to wait another whole year to see it again now that we have such a wonderful, quality version.The first time I saw this movie was when I was very young & it scared me a lot because of some of the content - but as I grew older & viewed it over again each year, I began to see it with ""new"" eyes. Now I am blessed again each year & reminded of the deeper message in it about the true Christmas Spirit - and what mine should be. As the Spirit of Christmas present states in the film - ""The Christ child does not live in our hearts but one day a year, but 365.""  Like New Year's resolution's - I don't always retain or do what I resolve to do. However, I was able to find a very unique plaque that I keep on my living room wall - in full view, all year long - that say's ""God Bless Us Everyone""  I love it!

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A331X75VH4ZBY3	J. Alec West	"Let me preface this article with a comment. Of all the versions of ""Scrooge"" I've seen, my favorite is the 1951 version starring Alastair Sim in the title role.  And regardless of what I'm about to say, I'll continue to watch AND enjoy the film for many years to come. However, this favoritism is qualified. The film is not without error. One of the prominent errors was a production error occurring near the end of the film. On Christmas morning, one of the first things Scrooge does is look into his wall mirror. And in that mirror you can see Scrooge's reflection, a reflection of the curtains behind him, and (grin) the reflection of either a stagehand or cameraman peeking out from behind one of those curtains.But, as embarassing as that error may have been, it isn't the worst error made in the film.To someone who has only seen the film, the error may not be readily apparent. But if you, like me, first read Dickens' novel, ""A Christmas Carol,"" upon which the film is based, you'll be left scratching your head.In the novel, the death of Scrooge's mother is only implied. And there is no hint as to the circumstances surrounding her death. And in the novel, the death of Scrooge's sister, Fan, is mentioned as being when she was an adult. But again, there is no hint as to the circumstances surrounding her death. The novel leads us to believe, therefore, that the distancing between Scrooge's father and Scrooge (and between Scrooge and his nephew, Fred) is merely because both were miserly unfeeling men. But in the screenplay written by Noel Langley, he introduces ""death during childbirth"" as the reason behind the deaths of both Scrooge's mother and Fan ... and uses this fact as the reason for Scrooge's father distancing himself from Scrooge and, later, for Scrooge distancing himself from Fred (Fan's child).The problem?In the novel, Dickens refers to Fan as being much younger than Ebenezer. Ebenezer being older than Fan is also implied (but never spoken of) in the film. But, if Fan was younger than Ebenezer and if their mother died during Ebenezer's birth, Fan couldn't exist. Their mother would have already been dead and buried by the time Fan should have been born.Langley made other revisions to Dickens' novel but this is the only one that backfired into a character error. But, it was an avoidable error if only Langley had used a different cause of death (and not been specific about the dates). While death during childbirth was common in Dickens' time, it was not as common as death by consumption (now referred to as tuberculosis). Dickens' own younger sister died from the disease. Her name was Fan."	4.0	Bah Humbug!  Taking Issue With a Classic Film	2005-11-02	34	13	21

While it may be true that the picture quality of this edition is superior to previous VCI releases, Morningstar Entertainment's 2005 ""Emerald Edition"" (A Christmas Carol) can justifiably boast of the best picture and sound quality of any edition of this extraordinary film.As at least one other reviewer has already observed, the print of the 1935 version included as an extra on this so-called ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" has been slashed from its original 78 minutes to an anemic 60---that's a reduction I hardly believe any true collector would find value in.The saving grace of this edition is an audio commentary provided by the venerable George Cole, which is enough to make it worthy of rental, but not of purchase, and which earns it a two-star rating, rather than the one-star rating I'd otherwise have given it.If you love this film, and consider it a part of your personal Christmas traditions as I do, pass on this edition, and choose either the aforementioned Emerald Edition or the 2001 50th Anniversary Edition instead."	2.0	A disappointing edition of the ultimate holiday film	2008-12-06	11	10	1

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AQ01Q3070LT29	James McDonald	"The 1951 British film stars Alastair Sim as ""Scrooge"".  Sometimes a black & white film is really good for effect.  But the print of the film is so bad, it might be best to see a computer-colorized version.  I originally saw this version of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" in its black & white form and it scared the dickens out of me.  So this review is for the colorized version.  Excellent performance as ""Jacob the Ghost"" from Michael Hordern.  Patrick Macnee plays ""Young Jacob Marley"".  Hermione Baddeley (Mary Poppins [1964] and the CBS tv series ""Maude"" in 1974-77]) plays ""Mrs. Cratchit"".  I can't say this is the best version and probably young children will not like this one.The computer-colorized version is a process that was used in the 1980's to add some color to an original black & white film.  it may not be a true color of a dress worn, but it does give the movie more depth and brings out many things you did not see in the original b&w; version.  This computer-colorized version is more rich in color than previous processes.At end of film, it says ""The End"" ""Scrooge"".  ""Scrooge"" was the original title of this British film.  The British also did this version of ""Scrooge"" in 1935 with Sir Seymour Hicks and in 1970 with Albert Finney as ""Scrooge""."	4.0	"Alastair Sim plays ""Scrooge"", Hermione Baddeley"	2003-12-20	3	0	3

We recently watched all nine versions we have accumulated through the past 20+ years. These include the ones with Seymour Hicks in 1935, to Patrick Stewart in 1999.  This 1951 production, starring Alistair Sim, is the best.  What we like about it most is how Scrooge is depicted after he's visited by the three Christmas spirits.  He is totally transformed.  He shows unbridled joy in being released from bondage to greed and contempt for his fellow man.  This depiction is unmatched by the other versions.  The colorized form of the movie is outstanding and adds a good bit to the story-telling.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A13ZAVU55QK5DW	Jason Knapp	This is easily the best movie adaptation of Dickens' little novel.Alastair Sim doesn't make his Scrooge into an object of curiosity or amusement. His character has soured on life's promises of affection and he uses that insight to help us believe in the character's journey from a sensitive young man to a bitter old one.Sure, it's great fun to take in how eloquently he voices his cynicism. But this Scrooge has real depth and that's what turns him from a cardboard character into a representative for anyone whose dreams have ever been dashed by a cold and heartless world. As the spirits take him back over that road to disillusionment, we see - as does Scrooge - how much he sacrificed when he gave up his hope in humanity.Sim makes that journey believable and meaningful; he breathes real life into the character so that we can't help but feel his pain and see in him some of our own. His transformation is measured, convincing and, finally, deeply moving.A great supporting cast rounds out the movie. Most notably, Kathleen Harrison, Scooge's charwoman, balances comic delivery with the emotion that let's us see how the coldness of one man hardens those around him. And, conversely, his conversion spreads warmth and light through her as well.Yes, the movie takes some liberties with the novel, but that's to be expected when you transplant a story from one medium and era to others. And this restoration is good, so good that the few shots that seem beyond repair stick out a bit painfully.Watch it and have a good cry. Hope, redemption and the persistent possibility of a little bit of good in everybody: isn't that what Christmas is all about?	5.0	Now It Smells Like Christmas	2008-01-27	2	2	0

Alastair Sim provides the best acting of Scrooge period.  Unlike other actors, Sim showed the most dramatic change as miserly Scrooge became the &quot;as good a man the ever town knew&quot;.  Another good thing is that this version provides a clever way of showing how the young Scrooge changed into his miserly condition.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2K4HN6EECBNR3	"Jean Baldridge  Yates ""jean, jewelry designer..."	I first saw this movie, starring the incredible Alistair Sim as Scrooge(the real title of the film), at school back in the fifties. We were ushered into the school gym and the projector was run for all of the children in my rather small school. I was entranced with the story. We owned a copy of the book at home, with the original illustrations, and it is remarkable either way. When you have Charles Dickens as the author, chances are you are going to get a classic tale which is honestly great.I find this movie, which I have viewed countless times, honestly great as well. I believe that it is all too true that people need to be taught at times how to behave toward other people: when Scrooge gets a second chance to become a good man and live the spirt of Christmas every day of the year after his visitations (from Jacob Marley, and the three spirits: Past, Present, and Future) it is incredibly affecting.I particularly found the visitation of Christmas Past interesting to watch, as an adult. I suppose I understand now why Scrooge became the man he became. No excuses, but it is a realization I didn't have when I first watched this film growing up. It is an excellent explanation of why a person would become cold and bitter and unfeeling.Alistair Sim's face is an extraordinary one. He sort of looks like a beagle. But when he is angry or mean, he is fearful looking. There are many things in this movie which are genuinely fearful, or sad, or moving.That is part of what makes it a great classic.True emotions evoked by fantastic directing (Brian Desmond Hurst) and perfect acting (not just by Sim, but also by Mervyn Johns as Bob Crachit, the epitome of a loving devoted father who must work for Scrooge to support his family, which includes, of course, Tiny Tim) make for a film which is worth watching any time of the year, by anyone.I recommend giving this to the person(s) you most love, and watching it together!I love seeing Scrooge go off in the snow at the end with a running, cheerful Tiny Tim, now healed because Scrooge has changed and is helping the Cratchits. It isn't silly, it is lovely. A great, uplifting scene!It is a true delight to have a great movie come so exquisitely and beautifully packaged just in time for the Holidays! It has everything you could want and more!Deck the Halls!	5.0	A Perfect Gift for the Member of Your Family Who Can't Get Enough Christmas!	2007-09-29	19	17	2
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"Let me make this clear: there is but one worthy film adaptation of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol,"" and that's the black-and-white version starring Alastair Sim as Ebeneezer Scrooge. Accept no imitations!The Sim version brings Dickens to life like no other. Scrooge's transformation from miserly old curmudgeon to joy-filled philanthropist is handled expertly. And much of Dickens' story is left intact or transformed in a way that is true to the original. The journey through Scrooge's lonely past is heart-wrenching and sad, laying the groundwork for his decisions to harden his heart to love and his fellows' welfare. The scene at the Old Joe's shop, where three characters trade in goods stolen from the dead, is wonderfully rendered and appalling. Though not in the original, the scene with Scrooge's charwoman, in which she fears for her personal safety in the presence of her transformed employer, ties up a loose end in the story and is a masterpiece of comic art.This is truly a wonderful adaptation. The emotions are right on the surface, and there is no post-modern self-referential nonsense to get in the way of the message. Dickens' dialog is showcased extensively. Even the very dated video double-exposure techniques seem to fit. ""A Christmas Carol"" is a masterwork that can be watched over and over. And its message (""The welfare of mankind was your business!"") can stand to be heard over and over as well!"	5.0	No other version comes close	2006-12-31	2	2	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y	Jeffrey A. Thompson	"This is the best movie version of ""A Christmas Carol"" period. Alastair Sim is fantastic. The whole scene where he wakes up on Christmas day as a transformed man is an amazing piece of acting. The rest of the cast is very good. The sets and costumes are very good. Scrooge's house is perfect. The writers and director took some liberties with the script, but the movie definitely remains true to the spirit of the book. The George C. Scott version is very good, but I think Sim's performance puts this one ahead by a long stretch.The extra features are good, but not great. I haven't tried the interviews yet so I might change my mind. The bio of Alistair Sim is very standard fare. The 1935 version is very dark and grainy version and it is a version that I don't like. The colorized version is a bad colorized version with the great Patrick Mac Nee giving the introduction. However, Mac Nee is very good in the introduction. The restoration of the black and white film is very good. Some frames seem a little fuzzy, but the fuzziness only lasts for a split second and the bad frames are very rare. For the most part the movie is clear and crisp. They have two aspect ratios: I tried the 4:3 and it worked well. I tried the audio for the blind and it was pretty good.In summary, I don't know if this is the ""Ultimate"" collector's edition, but it is worth every penny. The extras are good for the most part; however, the collection really delivers on the restored b&w; version."	5.0	Good restoration	2009-12-28	0	0	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1COZKITI0UYWX	Jerry C. Stanaway	"This is my favorite film version of the Dickens classic. My only complaint about this DVD release is that an edited version of the 1935 version, ""Scrooge"", starring Seymour Hicks is included as an extra, rather than the full version of that film. For some reason an edited version of the 1935 film has circulated in the U.S. for years. The full and uncut version was released on DVD in 2002 by Image Entertainment. One of the scenes cut from the film was near the beginning when two men approached Scrooge for a donation to the poor, and Scrooge asked them about prisons and workhouses. When Scrooge was told many would rather die than go there,he said they should do it to decrease the surplus population. The ghost of Christmas Present later repeats these words to Scrooge. In the cut version the ghost quotes something Scrooge said only in the uncut version! People whose opinion of the Seymour Hicks Scrooge movie is based on seeing the edited version should watch the whole film!Anyway, anyone really interested in the Seymour Hicks version should buy the complete version released by Image Entertainment. The complete film would have made a nice extra for this otherwise wonderful edition of the Alastair Sim ""A Christmas Carol."""	4.0	A Christmas Carol-Ultimate Collector's Edition	2009-12-15	2	1	1

Alastair Sim is superb in creating the character of Scrooge.The other remakes, and even the original, do not portray Scrooge as well as the '51 classic.

Much of the film does look and sound better, but several scenes have obviously been pasted together from varying sources of quality.  The result is a mish-mash that ruined the experience of watching the film.The restoration was a sloppy job that is obviously a result of sheer laziness on the part of the restorer.  Why, for instance, did they not fix the out of sync audio during the ""rag shop"" scene?  Was anyone making aesthetic choices for why you would insert one angle with bad source quality in one scene and then abruptly paste in the higher quality in the reverse angle?  It's very jarring.  It would have been better to keep a lower quality for the whole sequence so we wouldn't be shocked by the inconsistent quality.Even some frames have been dropped, which throw off the timing of crucial scenes, such as Scrooge's heartwarming asking of forgiveness at his nephew's party.  This final scene is probably the emotional high point of the film, and the scene is so chopped up with varying levels of footage and dropped frames that it ruins the drama.For those missing bits, why didn't they just use video from their last release of Christmas Carol on DVD?  This footage would be better than the badly out of sync, wrong frame rate video we see here. I realize they are not Criterion and the price of the DVD is very reasonable.  But at what cost?  It would be much better for everyone if they had done the restoration job right and charged more.For now, I'm going back to my old copy.  Even it's musty patina is better than this Scrooged-up one.PS; Never mind the absurd notion of cropping a classic into 16:9 for quasi-widescreen!  That's an abomination.  And colorization?

Even after more than 50 years, it still makes us want to watch it again (and maybe again).Alistar Sim has top billing here, and deservedly so.  He, more than anything else, makes this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" the best of all versions.  Michael Hordern, as Marley's ghost, also does a great job (an eerie job ... where he goes overboard ... but it works), and he (Hordern) does equally well in the flash-back scene of Marley's death (this deathbed scene was an ""adaptation"" that had not actually been written by Charles Dickens).  Alistar Sim ... rarely out performed by any co-star ... is most believable in this deathbed scene .The lady playing Mrs. Dilber (Kathleen Harrison ... a very busy actress in her day) is absolutely great ... her form in the ragman's shop being delightfully decadent.  The actor who plays the Ghost of Christmas Past (Michael Dolan) is perfect for the part, I thought.  Tiny Tim here (Glyn Dearman) is the best I've seen (of all Tiny Tims) ... maybe a tad too big for the part ... but very sincere and naive and innocent.  Mervyn Johns as Bob Cratchit is very effective ... though perhaps a bit chubby for this role ... I mean ... at 15 shillings a week, with a family of six to feed ... it hardly seems likely.  And the actor who plays Mr. Fezziwig (Roddy Hughes) does a very nice job.Mrs. Cratchit is played by Hermione Baddeley who also played Ellen (""It's Mrs. Banks ... she's  ome"") in ""Mary Poppins"".I am guessing the director should be given a lot of credit for this excellent quality, as all the actors and actresses seem to nail their parts down perfectly ... with there being very little if any over-acting.The background music is OK, but it occasionally is too loud (and perhaps a bit out of place) and the ""special effects"" of the turning hour glass (to signify passing time) does not quite cut the mustard either.  But this movie was premiered in 1951 ... not a terribly long time ago ... but perhaps long enough so that we should let them slide on these two points."	5.0	Excellent Version Of This Dickens Story	2004-12-22	2	1	1

It's almost sacrilegious to tamper with Dicken's timeless Christmas story, as the Reginald Owens version of the movie did, and if they had wanted to shoot the 1951 version in color, they would have done so.  Of all the versions of ""A Christmas Carol"", this is the only one to do the book justice.  Alastair Sim is the perfect Scrooge, just as Dickens wrote him.  The black/white version shows us, far more than the god-awful washed-out colorization, the dank and dark atmosphere lit only by the good-will of the season.  Scrooge's regeneration at the end of the film (""Will you forgive a pig-headed old man..."") would melt a heart of adamant.  I watch this movie every Christmas season.

Scott version to the Jim Carrey version.  I like this one alot because it has a few more scenes in the movie that are not in the others.  Alastair Sim's Ebenezer Scrooge is a great version because he portrays Scrooge not as ""snarly or vindictive"" but rather as cold as ice.  This Scrooge just doesn't care about anything other than how to get more money.  He doesn't yell, make mean faces or any of that, he just has a blank look about him like his empathy is gone.  The scenes with Marley are great because in this version, Jacob Marley is in scenes when ""The Ghost of Christmas Past"" shows Scrooge his life.  Marley sits with Scrooge with smiles as they do a ""hostile takeover"" of a brokerage.  Then the next scene shows Marley on his deathbed trying to warn Scrooge to change his ways.  This makes this movie even more interesting.  Great acting and scenery.  It is in black and white and that is okay since it was made back in 1951.  There is a 1930's version on this DVD as well that is quite good.  Great scenery, acting, and plot make this a must have to fans of Dickens classic tale.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A168VXSISJWQN9	"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover"""	This is undoubtedly the best version of Dickens' story and has been a staple in my house for as long as I remember. Alastair Sim was the definitive Scrooge and I haven't seen another portrayal that comes close. The only downside is the casting of the Cratchit family, other than Bob. The studio saw fit to give them upper-class British accents, and Tiny Tim, instead of being a withered little cockney boy on the point of death, is a strapping young fellow with gleaming hair and teeth and an accent which is more suited for Eton and Oxford than Camden Town. That apart, the other cast members are wonderful and Kathleen Harrison, given an expanded role as Scrooge's housekeeper, makes an excellent foil for the converted miser. The screenplay captures the spirit of the book without trying to be too literal and the special effects are excellent for the time. It's a Christmas tradition, and nothing more needs to be said.This release has some very good features, including both the B&W; and Colorized versions and unlike some others I think the color is well and sympathetically added and loses nothing compared to the B&W; original. It's the release everyone who loves the story, and this movie, should have.	5.0	Christmas present	2011-01-10	0	0	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A10ODC971MDHV8	John Farr	"Based on Charles Dickens's most widely read and enduring story, this definitive 1951 British version, better known as ""Scrooge,"" outdoes all others for atmosphere and, of course, characterization. The incomparable Alastair Sim, a gifted actor who seamlessly inhabits his role, makes you believe he is Scrooge. Skillfully directed by Brian Desmond-Hurst, ""Carol"" is tight at roughly eighty-five minutes, yet remains extremely moving, with Sim's droopy eyes projecting all of Scrooge's terror, shame, and regret. By contrast, his outright giddiness at the film's conclusion will leave you feeling just the same way--very much in the holiday spirit."	5.0	A Christmas Carol (1951)	2007-06-25	1	1	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2MFNDNS1L7D16	JOHN GODFREY	simply because of the excellent Scrooge played by Alister Sim.Scrooge has to carry the film obviously. The 1938 Hollywood version, is in some ways, better such as its supporting cast &  greater expositon of the story. Reginold Owens as Scrooge is fine, but it was a part built for John Barrymore. Who could fill those shoes? Unfortunately he was falling down drunk. He was injured & could not do it.The 1951 version is simply the best because if you don't have the best Scrooge you can't have the best Christmas Carol. It is regrettably short, but stll the best.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2TDK8D4HEMUYW	"John ""MovieAddict"""	Few characters are a true part of culture. Various creatures come and go, but only a few really stick around for eternity.Ebenezer Scrooge is one of those rare characters such as George Bailey or The Terminator who are quoted or imitated or just remembered in everyday progression. How many times have you heard the word &quot;Humbug&quot; used to describe disgust or lack of enthusiasm?Every Christmas, there is a handful of films I watch. The most famous holiday tale of all time, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; is always a first priority. I also enjoy watching Clark Griswald blunder about in &quot;Christmas Vacation,&quot; those nasty little critters wreak havoc in &quot;Gremlins,&quot; the bitter TV manager in &quot;Scrooged&quot; get taken back in time by three unconventional ghosts, Kevin McCallister defend his house in &quot;Home Alone,&quot; and Ebenezer Scrooge say &quot;Humbug.&quot;&quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; is, and shall remain, the better of the two. But &quot;Scrooge&quot; is a close second for the most likable and good-hearted holiday film. It's the best Charles Dickens book adaptation, and having read Dickens' work, it stays very true to the original.The story has been done with muppets and cartoon characters and even Bill Murray (a fine modern reworking, too), but this is and will remain the best version simply because everything about it is extraordinary. I think that many of the &quot;great movies&quot; are those that grow finer with age, and &quot;Scrooge&quot; gets only better and better every time I see it.Any filmgoer or classical literature fan is familiar with the story. Ebenezer Scrooge (Alastair Sim at his cranky best) is an old man living in London, England, thriving off the fortunes of his business but not able to enjoy the splendor of his wealth due to pure greed that exists within his soul.Scrooge is the dreaded town miser, the guy everybody moves out of the way for so they don't have to suffer the humiliation of being glared at by him. He walks through the streets of London with a scowl on his face and a look of extreme hatred. Nobody likes Scrooge, and Scrooge likes nobody, so it's a win-win situation.One Christmas Eve, after commanding family man Bob Cratchit (Mervyn Johns) to come to work the following morning, he retreats to his dark manor and is visited by four ghostly figures: his old friend and business partner, Jacob Marley (Michael Hordern) is the first, warning Scrooge that he will be visited by three more fellow unearthly beings. Scrooge is indeed visited by the various ghosts, first by The Ghost of Christmas Past (Michael Dolan), who takes Ebenezer Scrooge back in time to the point in his life when money meant nothing to him and happiness and love was everywhere.Then The Ghost of Christmas Present (Francis De Wolff) appears, showing Scrooge how other less fortunate beings such as Bob Cratchit are enjoying their Christmas, despite the fact that there is much sorrow and misery surrounding them. (Joy comes from the inside, remember?) Bob's son, Tiny Tim (another cultural icon), is a crippled boy who manages to look past the problems of life and appreciate the fine things. &quot;God bless us, every one,&quot; he says. It's the best line in the movie because it means so much.The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (C. Konarski) is the last of the spirits, giving Ebenezer a horrifying view into the future and the fate of his demise. This is Scrooge's ultimate wake up call, and the morning after (Christmas Day), Scrooge finally learns how to appreciate the fineness and pure joy of life. For greed, despite Gordon Gekko's prophecy, is not good.Alastair Sim isn't just good as Scrooge, he completely embodies him. He's grumpy and frumpy and in a split second manages to turn Scrooge into a likable character towards the end -- a character no longer driven by hatred and malice but rather by love and kindness.This is a universal theme as old as the days -- money isn't true happiness -- and &quot;Scrooge&quot; is the most clear and evident and believable example of this. It's a true classic story in the sense of the meaning, and not only does it deserve to be remembered as a fine story, the film itself deserved to be remembered as the classic it is.Over the years, Dickens' tale has been giving some acceptable and mediocre film treatments, and &quot;Scrooge&quot; is without a doubt the best of the best. From acting to set design, I can't imagine that, if Dickens were alive today, he'd find a single thing wrong with the adaptation of his beloved novel.Some movies are just fun, while other movies actually conceal important messages. &quot;Scrooge&quot; is, without a doubt, one of the most important and moralistic films ever made. Dickens' tale is one of the most black-and-white examples of greed vs. happiness, and the screen treatment is extraordinary: a story of learning to appreciate life instead of humbugging it. After all, nobody likes a humbugger.	5.0	The best adaptation of Dickens' wonderful classic...	2003-12-22	3	3	0

This company has been releasing classic films for several years now.  Their work has always been of top quality,  But this newly remastered classic of Alastair Sim's A Christmas Carol.  VCI has poured a lot of time and effort in restoring this film.  The film's transfer was digitally remastered from the original 35mm film elements and the soundtrack has been polished and cleaned up as well.  I have never seen this film look so crystal clear and brand spanking new.  The versions that have been previously released on video and for the small screen were real grainy and at times a tad blurry with a hissy and crackling soundtrack.  But not anymore thanks to the folks at VCI!This two disc set comes with a plethora of extras such as a computerized color version of the film (which looks pretty blah), the 1935 version of the film titled ""Scrooge"" (it's pretty sappy but entertaining), a 16 x 9 version of the film along with the standard one.  The soundtrack is also availible in the original mono and 5.1 Dobly Digital audio tracks.  A very informative commentary track featuring actor George Cole who has many interesting stories about the film and the actors. Several featurettes round out the extras along with two trailers for the film (England and North American).

This is not an endorsement of the colorization ....]The character of Scrooge, in the context of Dickens's classic but strangely little-heeded tale, has been a little easy for actors who enjoy current fashion to ""use."" Alastair Sim genuinely creates Dickens's character, his performance here is masterful and a delight, and brings forth the complete character of Scrooge, and not merely a caricature. I live in New England, and I have been working in a bank for seven years, but I watch this, and I wonder that the people around me (who would be horrified by the suggestion, I am sure) don't take the message ... there are many here who, though they have been ""taught to"" despise Scrooge, actually emulate his methods, and if they saw the character without the cultural baggage of the name ""Scrooge,"" would say, ""Why? What's wrong with him? He's just doing good business ....""Scrooge's repentance and rebirth on Christmas morning, are made perfectly convincing by Alastair Sim here. All through the movie, you had really believed he was the hardened old miser who had buried deep any vestige of humane compassion; and you really believe that he has cast off those shackles on Christmas morning, and that his spirit is singing -- and you really believe that he is going to do otherwise, now, and for the good of others.Rightly appreciated in all its depth and ramifications, this book is one of the most marvelous literary products of nineteenth-century England.

I consider it the best one and missed it so I bought the DVD. The quality is excellent.

"If you're going to buy one Christmas movie this year, make it A Christmas Carol Ultimate Collector's Edition.It doesn't get much better than this. VCI Entertainment gave us a present worth opening year 'round: a loving restoration of Alastair Sim as ""Scrooge."" This is the Real Deal; the restoration used the talented folks at Point 360 -- and it shows.  Both film and sound quality rate a solid 5. For the first time in 50 years, one is able to experience this film as it must have been in first release: richly textured and luminous.  (Minter's British winter looks warm.)  Alastair Sim is the quintessential Ebenezer Scrooge.  He's a miser and a lot cruel; and nobody's going to change him. And then, one Christmas Eve, he has four very rare visitors... Sim's Scrooge believes the story; so we believe.  His transformation is truly joyous, if inexplicable to the rest of his world. ""Scrooge"" is perfectly cast down to the smallest roles. Things to watch for: the blind man's dog, Marley's SHRIEK, the rich men who refuse to attend a certain funeral unless luncheon is served, the Crachits (of course), and the wonderfully incongruous, laughing Jumeau in the toy store window.  ""Scrooge"" is a joy to watch. It just is. ""God Bless Us. Every One!""VCI's intent is obvious: the company wants everybody to enjoy this movie and it provides 3 formats in order to do it! Along with 4x3, a ""colorized"" version and an enhanced widescreen 16x9 version are included. (The ""enhanced"" version appears to cut off the tops of certain visuals, like the toy store window display. The ""colorized"" version is done in soft, matte colors and isn't bad as far as these things go... The Original 4x3 theatrical version is by far the best!)  ""Scrooge"" is the first movie I own to have an audio track for the Blind. However, it isn't Closed Captioned. VCI blundered making the subtitles red.  For those of us with Aphasia and other learning disabilities, red is difficult to process if not impossible to read. For a company that obviously wants its product to be accessible, the red subtitles are a mystery.Disc 1:Original 4x3 (original theatrical ratio)Film Quality 4.5-5  (On a scale of 1 to 5)Sound Quality 5Subtitles - in RED - English & SpanishCommentary Track with Marcus Hern & George ColeEnglish with Narrative for the Blind16x9 Version for Widescreen TVs, with access the above featuresDisc 2""colorized"" version1935 ""Scrooge""Extras:TrailersSpirit of Christmas PastRichard Gordon remembers George Minter and  Renown PicturesCharles Dickens, His Life and TimesBefore & After RestorationPhoto Gallery"	5.0	"The Best Version of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" Just Got Better"	2007-09-25	8	8	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3P98J5DZ00A75	"Ken Roberts ""social historian"""	This is the version that so many feel is the definitive Christmas Carol. It really is an excellent version. Alastair Sim plays Ebenezer Scrooge like no one else can. The believability factor here for both, the 'old mean Scrooge' and the 'newly transformed Scrooge' is very high, with the transformation itself coming about slowly.  And that's what I like about this version. Scrooge doesn't suddenly become happy and giddy from the first of the three spirits, as in the Reginald Owen version. It takes Sim's old Ebenezer fully until the last spirit to convince him that he truly was a &quot;squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!&quot;Victorian London is well represented here, its sinister darkness, dreariness, and hopelessness surrounding the viewer in glorious black and white to further the mood of the dirty old town.This version has my favorite Jacob Marley (listen to the way he mourns and moans. Sends chills!). And Mrs. Dilber is hilarious at the end when Scrooge gives her a Christmas gift of money.I collect the different versions of this movie that are available, and this one is my second favorite, with the George C. Scott version ranking number one and the Patrick Stewart version, with the best Cratchit family I have yet to see captured on film,  coming in at number three. All have a bit to add to the story (including the Reginald Owen version) that the others may not have. All, pretty much, follow Dickens' original story (although, I must say, the George C. Scott version is truest to the book in the dialogue). Jacob Marley and Scrooge from Alastair Sim, the Cratchit's and the whole 'present' scene from Patrick Stewart, the dialogue and the sets from George C. Scott. My advice? By them all! Really! If you trust my opinion (and you have no copies of any version yet), purchase them in the order that I have placed them. You won't be sorry.	5.0	A Great Version	2001-12-04	18	15	3

I have not watched any of these extras and do not know if I even will or care to - I did not purchase this set for the extras, but for the film itself. VCI has done an exemplary job in restoring the original film.

Take nothing away from the distinguished artists who have also portrayed the character; Alistaire Sim is both the most dispicable and most reformed of any that I have seen.  The colorized version is wonderful, as well as the adpated version for the wide screen.  I also appreciated the inclusion of the 1939 version.  It is a paltry movie compared to Sim's powerful portrayal, but worthy of note as, I believe, the original.The biggest advantage of this edition is the digital restoration of the original black and white film.

Alastair Sim defines Ebenezer Scrooge. Nobody else has done it better.Nobody else ever will.The story needs no recounting (but I will anyway). Nasty old Scrooge treats all the world like dirt until he's visited by the enchained ghost of his dead business partner, Jacob Marley, whose face first appears in the midst of Scrooge's demonic doorknocker. Marley warns Scrooge to mend his ways or suffer the same miserable eternal fate. Scrooge ""Bah! Humbug!""s him, but is then visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future who review his life with him.This film version is faithful to Dickens and includes Scrooge's warm relationship with his sister (who dies in childbirth) and his ill-fated engagement. Though Scrooge is a miserable misanthrope, these episodes gain him some of the viewer's empathy. Scrooge thus appears less evil than merely lonely, a man who won't care because care causes pain. And he constantly looks like he's going to plotz.Sim is wonderful in this role. His bulging eyes give him a fearsome look, and his consistent tactlessness grates on everyone he meets---""Are there no jails? Are there no workhouses? Let them die, then, and decrease the surplus population.""Sim really excels, though, when his Scrooge wakes up happy on Christmas morning. His manic, childlike joy in everything is infectious---""I'm going to stand on my head, yes I will! I don't deserve to be so happy! Oh, I can't help it!""The viewer can't help being happy right along with him."	5.0	"""God bless us, every one!"""	2009-12-20	3	3	0

This great British movie has been a classic holiday staple of television for decades but often appears so grainy as to be wearing on the eyes.  The remastered version here is so crystal clear it almost is shocking to those of us used to the eroded copies commonly televised.  Both the original B&W; and colorized versions are here but the B&W; is far preferable as it captures the mood much better.  As with all such collectors' editions there are a wealth of extras to supply background information that may be of interest to the film buffs but nothing can add much to finally having a quality version of the film.Ah, yes - the film!!  It's a general rule that movies can never do justice to a great book but every rule has an exception and this superb version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is one of them.  The script, acting, and direction are all superb in this wonderful adaptation of the Dickens' classic about greed, redemption, and the Christmas spirit.  Alastair Sim gives an unforgettable performance as the curmudgeonly Scrooge who is given the chance to change his eternal fate by the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future.  No other film version of this holiday tale has ever approached the warmth and depth of this one.This version of ""A Christmas Carol"" stands among the greatest of Christmas films ever made and now the beauty of it has been made accessible for generations to come.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1LED4YL3KFLUX	"Larry Burdge ""jlburdge"""	Great B&W, very good colorized.  Though, as I am over 60 years old, I am partial to the old B&W version. Black and White always seems to add to a movie without taking away any of the quality of the story. Not usually so with a remake in color, though I understand why many of today's croud prefer it.  It's like pumping in laughfter (not necessary) trying to add to a movie and usually ends up with a negative result.  A good movie needs only a great story and good actors , a great movie needs only a good story with exceptionaly great actors. As it should be.	4.0	a christms carol ultimate collector' edition	2010-01-27	0	0	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"The 1951 version of ""A Christmas Carol"" comes down to the performance of Alastair Sim (To set the record straight, this film was released as ""Scrooge"" in the United Kingdom and as ""A Christmas Carol"" in the United States). Other versions have better known supporting casts and are in color, but this one has Alastair Sim. This British actor did other films: ""The Belles of St. Trinian's,"" ""The Millionairess,"" and ""The Ruling Class."" But you probably do not remember noticing him. There have been lots of great Scrooges, from George C. Scott and Mr. MaGoo to Scrooge McDuck and Patrick Stewart, from all of them had other roles. George C. Scott will always be Patton and Patrick Stewart will never stop being Jean-Luc Picard, no matter how many times he plays Professor X. But Alastair Sim was ""only"" Ebenezer Scrooge.This is not to diminish the rest of the cast. Michael Hordern is the match of Alec Guiness as Jacob Marley and his ghost, Hermione Baddeley is as fine a Mrs. Cratchit as we have seen, Francis De Wolff is a boisterous Ghost of Christmas Present, and Glyn Dearman is a perfect Tiny Tim. But we keep coming back to the point that Alastair Sim is Scrooge. This film is only 85 minutes long, but it covers the entire classical story by Charles Dickens. Screenwriter Noel Langley sticks close to the original (he would adapt ""The Pickwick Papers"" the following year), but tampering with this one is not advised. Director Brian Desmond Hurst's film is in black & white, but that hardly seems important (and colorization is a clear cut case of heresy) given C. Pennington-Richards's beautiful cinematography and Ralph Brinton's gorgeous art direction recreating old London town.But we keep coming back to Sim in a performance that sometimes has you wondering why anybody ever dared to essay the role again. Whether he is playing the heartless boss of Bob Crachit, the stingy miser who wants the poor to hurry up and die, the terrified old man confronting the ghost of his dead partner, the remorseful old man looking back at the happy days of his youth, the sobered figure looking at his own grave, and the giddy soul who keeps Christmas in his heart all the rest of the days of his life. You can enjoy many different versions of ""A Christmas Carol,"" but this one remains extra special, and we all know who gets the credit."	5.0	Alastair Sim as the quintessential Ebenezer Scrooge	2005-12-25	1	1	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2OWAOLWANDH2I	Leslie Jane Ludgate	"I've watched the 1951 version of ""A Christmas Carol"" every year of my life - it has always meant 'Christmas' to me. Now it's better than ever. The b&w; print is absolutely pristine, as clean as if it were made yesterday. Even the colorized version (I'm not a fan of colorizing) looks good. Nice to have a choice of full-screen or letterbox, as well.If you've been settling for lesser adaptations of this classic story, do yourself and your family a favor and try the Alastair Sim version. The characterizations are perfect - Sim is a perfect Scrooge, and the other actors did beautiful jobs as well, particularly Kathleen Harrison as Mrs. Dilber and Mervyn Johns as Bob Cratchit.The special features aren't all that great, however, so only four stars out of five. One of the extras is quite fun to watch, though: the 1935 Seymour Hicks version of 'Scrooge'. Although grainy, jerky, and unimaginative in terms of dealing with the ghosts (Marley isn't there at all, you have to imagine him!) it's lovely to see one of the very early movie versions of the story, filmed not quite a hundred years after the original was written."	4.0	Better then ever	2008-01-11	0	0	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2RHV42BTJSVON	"Liolania ""In2Jesus"""	"""A Christmas Carol"" is one of those stories that everyone knows, even if they have never read the book. It is doubtful they have not seen some version of this story; whether on Tv or a movie.  I have seen just about every film version ranging from ""A Muppets Christmas Carol"" to the newer televised musical version with Kelsey Grammar.  Some version are too sentimental, and some take a great deal of liberties, but after having read the book the 1951 version with Alastair Sim as Scrooge, keeps to the spirit and feel of the book most closely.On this DVD is THREE different version of the 1951 film.  One is the normal full screen, the other is meant for wide screen, and the third is color (which I was disappointed that it was not as beautifully restored as the B&W; version).  Either way you watch the movie it is a feast to the eyes, and all the performances are so wonderful, even if you hate old movies, you should love this!  On top of these versions of the 1951 version, included is also the 1935 film ""Scrooge"".  This is an enjoyable film, but there is no restoration on it so it is very dark.The extras are so plentiful compared to older DVD versions of this film I do not think that you would be wrong to buy a new one, if the newly restored film doesn't attract you.  These include a nice comparison between the restored and non-restored film, ""Spirit of Christmas Past"" which looks back on Alastair Sim's career and life, beautifully done cast bios, subtitles in spanish and english, and even a biography of Charles Dickens!  It is near impossible to become bored with this DVD collection.This is my new favorite version of ""A Christmas Carol"" because of its beauty, great acting, and faithfulness to the book.  So, I hope that you enjoy this movie, and it moves you into the Christmas spirit!God Bless & *Enjoy* ~Amy"	5.0	Undoubtedly the most consistent adaptation...	2007-09-28	3	2	1

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A25KKXUQQ0OLWB	"Lynn Ellingwood ""The ESOL Teacher"""	This is the masterpiece Christmas Carol.  I had never heard about this movie when I was younger, but in high school it began being shown on public television every year in a horribly scratched 16mm version around 11:30 at night.  I wonder how many others found out about the film the same way.  It was especially scary because the picture and sound was so bad it made the ghosts seem even more ominous and terrifying.  My brother and I loved it.  We owned the VHS version and the other DVD version.  This christmas, he bought several copies so each member of the family had his/her own and a friend gave him a copy for himself!  Now that's a Christmas classic!  I was glad to that the film has been given the royal treatment and I will no longer have to endure bad pictures and bad sound.  In fact, the movie is pristine!  The old 1935 British version is included here too.  It is not nearly as good but has some good performances in it and isn't as slick as the MGM version that followed.  I'm so pleased I got this DVD.

Sitting in the darkened sunroom with my grinning but enthralled older brothers, wanting to look and afraid to look -- trying to hide my terror of the three spirits.  That was over 50 years ago, and I've not seen an adaptation that is better.  The black & white ambience, the haunting oboe melodies in the background, shifting from plaintive to ominous to threatening...and the performances, oh, the performances!  We watched and chanted the lines every year -- an Old English Christmas version of Rocky Horror.  We saw new things and deciphered the meaning of unfamiliar sayings -- Bob's yer uncle!  As new children came along, rules about the proper age for viewing were set, broken, and reinforced when at least one small sprite begged to stay, but later ran from the room in tears.  When it was released on VHS, we all gave one another copies.  We still watch it every year when family gathers -- whether all together or apart in different locations.  It is the ultimate Christmas Carol, and a wonderful family ritual.	5.0	An Annual Celebration	2009-12-03	0	0	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A96VY2TCAHE4G	Mannie Liscum	"There are numerous issues and re-issues of the 1951 version of  ""A Christmas Carol"" so why purchase this 2007 VCI release?  To say that this film version of Dickens' story is a classic would be an understatement.  Hailed by most critics as the best of all the versions made over the past 70-odd years, this review need not dwell on whether or not this is a movie worthy of watching; many other reviewers here have said as much.  What has typically not been done in reviews posted here is to give potential purchasers an in-depth analysis of what makes this release a most have (or not) for first time watchers, someone looking for a great Christmas gift, or simply a fan who wants ""The Ultimate Collector's Edition (as this release is advertised).  This review will attempt to cover, not the film itself in much detail - although some aspects will be discussed.  Instead it will focus mainly on the extras and production value present on this release compared to other releases.  Importantly this review WILL NOT simply provide a litany list of 'extras' present on the discs (you can get that at IMDB), but rather will review the content of the extras.  So read on and decide for yourself whether VCI's ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is all it's advertised!In a comparative sense it is probably most critical to compare this 2007 (two-disc) VCI release of ""A Christmas Carol"" to VCI's 2004 (one-disc) release of the same movie.  Let's start with a list of features/extras on the 2004 release:- Remastered original B/W version of the 1951 film- Extras: colorized version of the 1951 film- Max Fliesher's Technicolor cartoon Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer (1948, 8 min) [good quality]- Selectable subtitles/narration (English, Spainish, narrative for the blind in English) - Introduction to both B/W and color versions (same intro, narrated by Patrick MacNee, in both cases); Cast & Production Notes (really just cast bios)- Comes with a nice interactive menu- Nice if simple clamshell packaging with 'movie board' insert.Here's what you get with the 2-disc 2007 VCI ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" with commentary on the 'value' of the features/extras:Disc 1 contains- 4x3 and 16x9 [enhanced for widescreen TVs] B/W (original) version of 1951 film with selectable subtitles (English, Spainish) - buyers should be aware that original release was full screen thus 16x9 version is cropped on top and bottom to make widescreen (essentially vertical version of Pan-Scan to convert WS to FS); The picture quality of the remastered version is splendid.  Improved over 2004 version.  Very few flaws still visible.  Tones are crisp and contrast great.- Audio options (2 channel, 5.1 channel Surround, narration for blind in English - same narration as on 2004 VCI version) - Surround sound - very nice for most part, although tends to 'amplify' noise - audio apparently harder to clean up than the picture. Yet did nice job enhancing certain parts, e.g., when Scrooge gets to his front door (when he sees the first ghost of Marley) we here the wind blow from front left (channel) to rear right; when Scrooge is shown his tombstone by ghost of Christmas future, the music is nice in surround, Scrooge's voice only comes through center front channel - very well done.- Cast bios - much expanded over 2004 version- Audio Commentary by Marcus Hearne (British film/music documentarian) and George Cole (played young Ebenezer Scrooge in the 1951 version) - some interesting insights are provided by Cole about the actors and making of the movie. Hearnes' historical knowledge also provides interesting material and context for Cole's personal recollectionsDisc 2 contains- ""Scrooge"" 1935 version (directed by Henry Edwards, starring Sir Seymour Hicks as Scrooge) - picture is very dark and grainy; this is true of both outside and inside shots.  Nice extra to have but quality not very good.- Colorized version of 1951 movie (same as on 2004 VCI release) with selectable subtitles/narrative (English, Spainish, narrative for blind in English)- Two trailers, one titled ""Scrooge"" and one titled ""A Christmas Carol"" - ""Scrooge"" is very dark in theme and picture tones, music is ""Scrooge theme"" from 1951 movie, whereas ""A Christmas Carol"" is happier and lighter in both theme and picture tone, upbeat Christmas music accompanies- ""The Spirit of Christmas Past"" - Marcus Hearne interviews George Cole about Alastair Sim.  Interview done against blackscreen such resulting in sharp visual contrasts (when Hearne is seen asking questions, he too in against blackscreen), with pictures and clips of Sim interwoven into the interview dialog.  Much of interview not directly about Sim, but rather (appropriately) also about Cole's career (especially when co-staring with Sim in other projects).  Fairly dry interviewer and interviewee, but informative.  [total run time just less than 15 min]- ""Richard Gordon Remembers George Minter & Renown Pictures"" - Gordon helped raise money for making ""A Christmas Carol"" and distributed it in US.  This feature is done entirely as an audio interview of Gordon by Tom Weaver (author and film historian], laid over still photos and film clips of elements being discussed in interview.  Much of the interview is centered on story of how Gordon and Minter formed working relationship (via Renown Pictures).  Gordon tells several stories: Minter's rise as producer/presenter of films; how ""Scrooge"" as made in UK was re-titled ""A Christmas Carol"" for release in US; how picture released in US was not initially hailed, was actually not seen as 'family' movie but more equated to 'horror' movie; how when ""A Christmas Carol"" hit US TV it became a cult hit, but in UK was hit from initial release (Sim was very popular actor in UK at time); tells of other films in which Minter collaborated before and after ""Scrooge"" with considerable discussion of other Minter films (e.g., ""Svengali"" and work with ""Old Mother Riley"" films that were popular in UK). [total run time ~20 min]- ""Charles Dickens, His Life and Times"" - Audio biography accompanied by illustrations and photos.  Discusses Dickens' unpbringing, early relationships, early struggles and later prolific writing career (critically acclaimed), his marriage (to Catherine Hogarth) and affair with Ellen Ternan, and his poor health later in life.- ""Before and After Restoration"" - Not really a 'before and after' comparision as advertised on the clamshell.  Rather a few scenes are shown in split screen comparison but most thus is a discussion of the technical aspects of the restoration process. Like to be of most interest to those with technical savvy [~ 2 min in length].  If the viewer wants a fair comparison of the picture restoration of this 2007 version watch it in comparison to VCI's 2004 release (or previous prior releases).- Photo gallery - stills from the movie, as well as production stills and actor/actress publicity shots.  All images shown in ""Ken Burns effect"" (moving and zooming). Edge of screen is surrounded by a 'snowy' matte.  No audio tracks accompany this extra.All in all this is an excellent 2-disc set sure to be a hit with all fans of the movie.  If you're new to the film version of Dickens' classic pick up THIS release, it's worth the $.  5 solid stars (for movie and extras)."	5.0	Crisp and clean restoration of the classic, plus loads of interesting extras	2007-11-11	51	49	2

Sim is the perfect actor for Scrooge. I even like the liberties the producer did with the story, with that delightful scene with Mrs. Dilbert where she thinks Scrooge has gone stark raving mad!I loved the DVD version which has the original B&W; version. (It has the colorized version, too, but I ignored that.) And to my surprise, it has Art Fleischer's cartoon ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" as a bonus. Two classics for the price of one!

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A18S2VGUH9SCV5	Margaux Paschke	I think everyone can agree that this movie is the ultimate classic Christmas tale.  It's been so many years since I saw this version that I forgot how great a movie it is and worth annual viewings (why don't they run this on tv anymore?).  This is a 2 dvd set edition - the movie and extras.  The movie speaks for itself and the quality is there.  It's all about the extras and plenty of remarkable extras have been provided here: the audio commentary (how did they get this? I wouldn't think they did this at the time so this must have been added much later) is a great addition as is the actor's reminiscence of that time.  Those two were the most compelling for me but there are plenty of others to enjoy.  The only minus with this movie is that it's greatness is NOT appreciated by my kids (not spooky enough and too much talking about life stuff) but maybe one day they will grow to apreciate it.  This movie is a must for the holiday season and I strongly recommend this one as it really is the ultimate collector's edition!	5.0	a true classic	2007-10-11	2	1	1

You've never seen A Christmas Carol until you see this new Blu Ray. I was shocked and beside myself at how well this new restoration turned out. The detail is unreal, especially for a film that has always looked so bad. It's not flawless mind you, with the ocassional nick and scratch, but overall this is a beautiful transfer and worth every penny for an upgrade. The sound is quite nice as well.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2KI1SGCZT2OEI	"Mark E. Stenroos ""Sibelius fan"""	"I received my copy of the 60th Anniversary set today via Amazon (and kudos to Amazon, which refunded me a total of $7 from the pre-order price I had paid back on Oct 2, charging me a mere $10.99 for this 2-disc set, ie: at their Nov 2 price).I haven't watched the entire movie, but spot checks of the film on the BluRay disc reveal the best-ever VCI transfer. It's even better than the BluRay version that was released in 2009. Also, it seems to me like the picture contains more along the edges than it has before. I'm wondering if VCI has been clipping the left & right sides of the film image all these years due to deterioration, but were somehow able to restore those edges with the new computer software they said they used on the film this time around. I did notice that a restoration credit is given to a firm called ""Blair & Associates"" that isn't VCI, with a copyright date of 2011. Perhaps they finally decided to send the thing out of house and get it done right.I can't imagine why VCI isn't hawking this version more aggressively, because it does seem to fulfill - finally - the promises VCI has made over the years about just how painstaking their restoration efforts have been. Those promises have always led to a bit of disappointment in the past. Not this time.Also, the soundtrack is absolutely quiet, at least when played in the original mono. I haven't tried the 5.1 surround sound yet, and I don't know that I will. I'm something of a purist in this matter.I watched the Leonard Maltin intro, and it was very good and professional, supplying info I didn't know (such as the fact that Glynis Johns is the daughter of Mervyn Johns, who plays Bob Cratchet).I have only ONE very small complaint, and it seems almost ridiculous to point out, but the subtitles come up a second or so before the lines are actually delivered on the screen. They're not synced precisely to the beginning of each new phrase in the dialogue. That's really not a problem as I never watch the entire film with subtitles. At least these subtitles are in white, rather than the hard-to-read red of the Ultimate DVD Edition. And, the point size of the subtitles is a bit smaller than it was on the 2009 BluRay version.The set also includes a hardcopy ""Abridged American Pressbook"" that I assume represents what was sent out to American film houses when the film was released in 1951. It's a very nice touch, and something that I haven't seen in earlier releases. The little booklet is a 3-page gate fold that unfolds into a two-sided promo kit that pictures the posters and lobby posters that were available to promote the film. I especially love the tie-in promotion to the Classics Illustrated ""Volume 53,"" ""A Christmas Carol."" Fascinating stuff!I did not know that the film was retitled from ""Scrooge"" to ""A Christmas Carol"" for its initial US release. Hey, I'm learning all the time!I watched a couple of the bonus features on Saturday, and they are well done and supply interesting information.Edited 12/7/11: I watched this BD in its entirety last night, and it is just amazing how clean and, well, wonderful it all is. The picture is rock steady, except when there are fades moving from one scene to another, ie: movement that appeared from Day One on this film and was usual for films made in this period. What you won't see is the picture nervously moving off its axis. It is as solid as if it were done digitally. The detail and depth to the picture is the best I have ever seen on this film. And, yes, that reaction shot from Fred's wife that was missing from the UCE has been restored. Less than a second and a half of film, but oh so meaningful.The sound is also remarkable. What's nice is that almost all of the old-movie static has been effectively removed, so the voices and the film score register beautifully. I first watched with the original mono track playing, and it is very fulsome and vivid. I later went back and watched the entire movie in surround sound. Funny, but the surround process seems to be less-clean than the mono track! The movie sounds its age more in surround than in mono. That said, the orchestral score registers more effectively in surround, and that's important, as the musical score for this film is one of its glories. And, yes, I noticed that total sound drop out in the scene where Scrooge visits Fred for Xmas dinner in the surround track. The drop out lasts about 4 seconds. Very unfortunate.Still, definitely worth getting."	5.0	It Looks Like VCI FINALLY Got It Right - And For Cheap!	2011-11-05	57	54	3

When I read the reviews for the $9.96 version, it had exactly the same reviews as the $19 version.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	ARXU3FESTWMJJ	"Mary Jo Sminkey ""15 years of Amazon Reviews!"""	"A Christmas Carol became a huge hit almost as soon as Dickens wrote it and has remained a classic ever since. Is there any movie that has been remade so many times and in so many ways? From more recent versions with George C Scott, or even more recent with Patrick Stewart to children's version with the Muppets or even Mr. Magoo to musicals to other derivative versions like Scrooged and American Christmas Carol, few stories are as enduring as that of the curmudgeonly Scrooge and his ghostly visitations. This surely is one of the best of the traditional movie versions. Alastair Sim is absolutely believable as Scrooge, from beginning to the very end, hitting all the right emotional notes along the way. Getting to play the restored B&W; version on my large widescreen TV is truly a delight, one can really get immersed in the story and the wonderful acting without grainy old images and crackling sound track getting in the way. Being able to listen to an audio commentary on a 50+ year old movie was certainly extraordinary! I've always been a fan of commentaries and it's amazing the recollections that they provided us with. An additional track for the blind is certainly an interesting, and I'm sure for visually impaired people, a very welcome addition.Going to the second disk, we have the often lamented colorized version. While like most I do prefer the original B&W; I do often enjoy watching colorized movies once in awhile. My grandfather often colorized photos and many of my favorite photos of my mother are ones that he colored and watching old colorized movies somewhat reminds me of them. The additional features and interviews on this disk have some interest....the before & after on the restoration is kind of neat. I think I will enjoy the interviews more in the future, they became a little much after already being through the audio commentary on the movie. Getting another edition of ""Christmas Carol"" was a neat bonus, but would have been much nicer if that movie had been restored as well.Overall, this is a truly wonderful movie, well worth the purchase price, and full of wonderful features and bonuses that will surely be enjoyed for years to come."	5.0	If only all the great classic movies could come in editions like this!	2007-09-28	2	2	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2OM316GK7MPHT	"Matthew Kapsiotis ""mk915"""	"In this 1951 version of ""A Christmas Carol"", Scrooge is portrayed by the very brilliant British actor Alastair Sim.Sim brings the character of Scrooge to life by providing viewers with an honest performance of how a person so rich, cheap, and grumpy can transform into a cheerful, giving, and overall caring individual.  Also, Sim's facial expressions of disbelief and impatience are extremely funny and offer a humorous side to a rather serious and interesting story.  Furthermore, Sim's ability to practically become the character of Scrooge by digging into Scrooge's emotions is what really makes his performance stand out.Overall, this film is fantastic and has always been one of my favorite Christmas movies to watch.  The DVD is so clear and you must watch this movie in black and white.  The color version is very artificial and takes away from the dark scenes such as Marley's appearance before Scrooge.Don't hesitate to buy the DVD if you're thinking about it.  It's great and well worth preserving in your movie collection.Note: This DVD is a one disc and double sided.  One side is the color version, and the other the black and white version."	5.0	The Best Version of the Classic, Period!	2004-11-21	6	5	1

No offense, to Hollywood, but that makes a difference for this story.  Secondly, what makes Sims such a great Scrooge is he plays a believable ""Redeemed Scrooge"".  This is really the most difficult part of the character.  It's easy to play the mean scrooge.  Sims, however, really comes across as believably transformed.  And not just a buffoon, like most other actors who have portrayed the character."	5.0	Best Version of the Dickens Classic	2006-12-03	4	4	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2ZJF4SKBVIW45	"M. Bentt ""Bookish Baba"""	Viewing this particular version is a tradition in our family--my earliest memories include watching this at my grandparents' home in the 'big city' (they had a tv--we lived on a farm &amp; had no tv). One of the interesting things is that my grandparents were Ukrainian immigrants who did indeed prosper in Canada, but never forgot their humble beginnings.  Their home was always filled with scents of good food, laughter, song, and lively conversation. Christmas was a very important time for family &amp; friends, and they did indeed 'keep Christmas well', one of the lessons I have since learned. This film has not lost its relevance in this 21st century world. While the special effects in the 1951 version may seem very simple to many, relative to the period, the film was well-done.  &quot;God bless us, everyone&quot;.	5.0	Highly entertaining	2004-12-10	5	4	1

The picture has no scratches or dirt, but there are few bright white spots in the film, but its 56 years old. The sound is awesome. Sure the 5.1 surround doesn't really work with all the talking, but once the orchestra kicks in, its like they are playing in your house.If you own a previous copy, its worth the upgrade for the sound and picture alone, but the special features are not the best and the commentary will make you fall asleep.	4.0	A Classic	2007-10-26	6	6	0

Alistair Sim IS Scrooge -- everyone else can just give it up at this point. His Scrooge is miserly and misanthropic, of course, but he also lets you see that he has come to his soul affliction by bad judgment and poor circumstance, not a lack of heart. You feel that his pain and loneliness are real and, therefore, rejoice that much more at his redemption. As the reviews have said, this movie is light on special effects but rich in spirit. In fact, the scene of Scrooge awakening on Christmas morning (especially his bit with Mrs. Dilber) may be some of the finest acting ever captured on film.

The entreaty to love each other and to give freely without selfish expectations are universal truths invoking God's own spirit as He gave His Son for us all, (John 3:16).  This movie version of Dickens classic tale of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge stays extremely close to the original.  The acting is unsurpassed, and Alistair Simms shines as Scrooge.  His performance is more convincing than any I have ever seen, and his giddy transformation at the end of the film had me laughing for joy along with him.  The supporting cast is equally wonderful.  I especially loved this film's treatment of the character of Tiny Tim.  The boy is cheerful and sweet without being overly dramatic or syrupy.  His gentle spirit is truly endearing.  I also loved the depiction of the Ghost of Christmas Present.  His jollity is contageous, yet the scene depicting the miserable children, (Want and Ignorance), who cling to the spirit, is heartrenching and emotionally jarring.Please give this wonderfully unforgettable film a chance.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2CWIYIETNBAK3	Michael Birman	There have been many Christmas carols released over the years, including one filmed in 1936 by MGM and starring Reginald Owen. That film, though servicable as a reasonably faithful adaptation of Dicken's immortal story, is merely a pale reflection of the emotional depth and stylistic power provided by this brilliant version starring the great English actor, Alastair Sim. Director Brian Desmond Hurst creates an intense, emotionally driven, noirish atmosphere in which Scrooge is confronted by several shocks from his past (the death of his sister, the loss of his only love, his troubled view of his nephew, his complicity in the demise of his first employer's, Mr. Fezziwig's, business). These shocks allow Scrooge's conversion to a kinder, gentler Scrooge to acquire a much greater resonance: it is true redemption. It simply makes more sense when the raw human clay is a real man and not 2-dimensional cardboard.Given Scrooge's loveless past, we begin to understand Scrooge as a character. Sympathy replaces the simplistic hatred of a caricature that too many retellings of this story evoke. Sim's performance is simply stunning. No performance of Scrooge duplicates the sheer emotional range provided by Sim. The rest of the cast is equally superb. This is a quintessentially English story and it merits an English production. All aspects of this production, from script to set design, acting to direction, are at the highest levels of excellence. You owe it to yourself to see this splendid, unforgettable production. And see it in its atmospheric, beautifully filmed black and white version:  the way it was filmed, the way it was meant to be seen. Highest possible recommendation.Mike Birman	5.0	The definitive Christmas Carol	2007-09-17	4	1	3

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1LQTE5YWH7EVZ	"Michael Fiore ""Discover"""	"First off, I am a great fan of all Charles Dickens works but I'm particularly fond of ""A Christmas Carol"". I probably own just about every filmed version of this classic that one can obtain. Of all the versions,(and there are many) this one starring Alastair Sim is far and away the best I've ever seen. Sim's performance is incomparable and brilliant! So much so, that it will be difficult to watch the other films after you've seen this one. (That's saying a lot. The one starring George C. Scott was quite good.)This release includes the magnificently restored B&W; original version, a colorized version of the original, and as a bonus, an earlier B&W; film version starring Seymour Hicks!(...gasp...I can hardly go on...). It also includes some other bonus material I've not seen in any edition such as the ""Richard Gordon Remembers Minter and Renown Pictures"". I'll not restate the all the bonus description here but I will say that while it's not a lavish production, it IS truly fascinating as well as informative.If you are not a fan, why not buy this release and get the most for your money?If you are a fan, it is an ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE. There is so much in this release to appreciate I can't possibly put it into this review. Unless a better edition is released, this is truly the ultimate edition.Alright...alright...I'll say it...""God bless us, everyone...""--May Christmas always be in your heart.***********UPDATE**********After reading other reviewer comments, I felt an update was in order.My favorite scene in the entire film begins with no dialogue at all. It's when Scrooge arrives at his nephew Fred's house for Christmas dinner after his transformation. He's ashamed and perhaps a little fearful of how he'll be received, so he pauses at the drawing room doors, unable to open them, and looks back over his shoulder as if for approval. The maid who is watching, gently smiles and nods, offering Scrooge the encouragement he needs to go in. An awful lot of humanity passes between the two, yet not a word. Scrooge goes in and after some initial shock is gaily greeted by his nephew Fred.It is here that a reviewer has noted that a reaction shot of Fred's wife has been deleted. This is true. In the old version, Fred opens his mouth in astonishment and then exclaims, ""Uncle Ebenezer!"", as he hops up and goes to greet him. During his exclamation, the camera is actually on Fred's wife for 1 1/2 seconds. She says nothing, but has a look of bewilderment on her face. In the restored version, Fred's exclamation begins as soon as Fred opens his mouth, making the audio very slightly out of sync with the picture so they could cut the 1 1/2 second shot of Fred's wife and not lose the audio. However, just after that, Fred turns to his wife and says, ""My dear, look who it is!"". At this point in the old version, we see the exact same 1 1/2 second shot of Fred's wife repeated. We also see this shot in the restored version as well. So, the old version shows the same 1 1/2 second shot two times, while the restored version shows it only once.Minor, but do I wish VCI hadn't done this? --- YES!Another reviewer noted that there's an audio dropout of Scrooge's fearful scream when the door flies open when Marley's ghost appears. This is also true. Although, I suspect that this is not an artifact of burning the discs. I think it's a deletion.Again, minor --- but I can't even begin to imagine why.The overall restoration, in my humble opinion, outweighs these very minor ""edits?"". Fortunately, they're not numerous and are not major enough to ruin the film. Honestly, though, editing should be left to the directors. When ""RESTORERS"" make edits they go beyond their purview as restorers of the film. The color version, which is included, has not undergone the same processing so you still have the unrestored original film version to watch. You could even turn down the color on your TV and watch it in B&W; if you feel you must.I gave the FILM 5 stars and that certainly still stands. I suppose I'd give the restoration 4 1/2 stars.---May the Christmas Spirit be always in your heart!"	5.0	Cheers for Charles and Alastair!!!	2008-05-14	4	4	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A13N1OT1727RK5	Michael	"There is a reason why this version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL is considered by almost everyone to be the definitive version. It is not because of great special effects or production values (at least, not if we are to judge by the crew member whom we glimpse briefly in the mirror in Scrooge's bedroom near the end). It is not because it is the most faithful adaptation of Dickens, nor because of any visual splendor, nor because it is the most ""fun"" version for a family curl up with on Christmas Eve. It is because of Alastair Sim's magnificent, endearing portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge. Sim makes Scrooge a three-dimensional person, not a cardboard cutout. He imbues the character with depth and richness, from his bitterness towards the world to his horror upon meeting the ghosts to his giddy euphoria on Christmas day. Sim was primarily a comic actor, and it shows; he makes Scrooge hilariously funny at times (such as, ironically, during Marley's death scene). Scrooge's transformation at the end is utterly believable because Sim throughout the film lets us see glimpses of the goodness and good humor that have been buried in Scrooge's heart for so many years by bitter experience and which are just waiting to come out. That scene where Scrooge joyfully scampers about the room after awakening from his dream is absolutely cathartic in Sim's hands.All right, maybe I have slighted the other components of the film. It presents the true, bleak Dickensian vision of Victorian London; it is as far from a ""picture postcard"" CHRISTMAS CAROL as you can get. It is amazingly economical, compressing the story into barely 90 minutes and presenting it in a bare, brisk, unsentimental fashion, almost like a gritty documentary. There is real horror and dread in this movie (one example: when Scrooge ascends the staircase in his house) and I can just imagine how frightening these moments must have been on the big screen. All the embellishments to the Dickens story are entirely apt. And it boasts a fine musical score by Richard Addinsell, which is now available on CD. Treat yourself this Christmas to the definitive version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL (and in the original black and white, please; this is one of those movies that color absolutely ruins)."	5.0	Alastair Sim is Simply the BEST	2004-12-20	4	3	1

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2GKMCO8QDOELK	Modemac	When one talks about the great classic horror films, the names&quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Dracula&quot; often pop up, or even &quot;Robert Mitchum.&quot;  But the classic 1951 A CHRTISTMAS CAROL, starring the unforgettable Alastair Sim, can be seen as one of the great horror films of the silver screen.  It has all the elements of a good scare story: it's actually about three spirits who frighten Ebenezer Scrooge out of his suicidal lifestyle, to bring him back into the world of the living.  This particular film takes the story seriously, so that we don't see any songs or comedy sidekicks or anything of that sort.  The film itself is framed in the style of the classic horror movies and German expressionist films, with masterful use of shadows and music to build up suspense.For example, look at the scene where Scrooge comes home and sees Jacob Marley's image on his door knocker.  He enters his home, when he thinks that someone is following him...and in the space of a few seconds, he becomes concerned, the nervous, then frightened, as he rushes up the stairs.  The music at this moment is an ominious bass, which combines with the eerie shadows of the stairwell and banister to give this scene a &quot;feel&quot; that moves the audience and makes them uneasy...in precisely the same style as the great horror films.  Likewise with the next scene, where Scrooge hears someone dragging chains up the stairs, and he becomes more apprehensive - until suddenly the door to his room is hurled open, and he cries out in fear.  Even though we, the viewers, are so used to horror film stereotypes that we know the door is going to open, we are *still* caught off-guard by Scrooge's sudden panic.There are tortured spirits, cinematic horror tricks of darkness and lighting (most notably when the Ghost of Christmas Future takes Scrooge to the site of his own grave), and a lingering feeling of sadness...most of all because we are seeing the life of a lonely man who is too afraid of the world to come out and let himself feel for others, even to the point of losing the woman he loves.  But in the end, the spirits work their miracle, and Scrooge is returned to the land of the living.  We feel this movie in our hearts...but also in our nerves, as this CHRISTMAS CAROL uses the techniques of the horror film to affect us.This is one reason why the 1951 version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL is still the greatest CHRISTMAS CAROL of all: it is a true horror movie.	5.0	One of the great horror movies	2001-09-25	8	3	5

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2UQIIJ2CD8REE	Monty Moonlight	"In 19th century London, cold-hearted miser Ebenezer Scrooge gets a Christmas Eve visit from the ghost of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley. Marley's visit heralds three more, the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, all to come that night in turn. The goal of the spirits is to reform Scrooge in order to save him from Marley's fate: an afterlife of unrest bearing heavy chains of remorse. They seek to accomplish this by showing Scrooge select moments from his life and the lives of those he affects, as have been, are, and will be, from Christmases long past to those yet to come. Scrooge witnesses how his lonely boyhood changed to happiness, but soon turned cold with growing greed, anger, loss, and distrust. He sees the plight of London's poor and destitute and how he ever turned a bind eye to them, and witnesses the love he lost in his pursuit of an idle fortune. Nothing, however, is as disturbing as those images of Christmases yet to come. Can these emotional visions work their magic in time to save Ebenezer Scrooge's soul?Presented in this new, 2-disc DVD set is probably the world's favorite version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" the 1951 British film (known as ""Scrooge"" in England) starring the magnificent Alastair Sim. As a great fan of the various film versions of ""A Christmas Carol,"" from those starring human actors to ones featuring the likes of Yosemite Sam, Kermit the Frog, and Mickey Mouse, I have to confess that this is probably the best, and it had been years since I'd seen it! Most versions of Charles Dickens' classic Christmas tale have something special that sets them apart and makes them worthy of the holiday film lover's home library, and I think one of the best aspects of this version is the depth the film takes us into Scrooge's past, something barely touched upon in the 1935 version included as a bonus in this set. Adding to the touchingly real and thorough look into Scrooge's history is the excellent casting of George Cole as the young incarnation of Ebenezer. He bears a fine resemblance to Alastair Sim, and both are wonderful in the role. It makes the flashbacks all the more believable. The rest of the ensemble cast is also excellent, featuring great British character actors like Hermione Baddeley and Mervyn Johns, who play the struggling Cratchits, and Michael Hordern, who plays Jacob Marley. Directed beautifully by Brian Desmond Hurst, the excellent restoration job done for this release makes it look better than ever in glorious black and white! Of course, you also can watch the unrestored, colorized version if you have a mind to, and there's even a mock widescreen version of the restored film included for folks who want the picture to fill up their modern, wide-style screens.As for the bonuses, Disc One includes the aforementioned regular and enhanced widescreen versions of the newly restored, black and white film, along with text cast bios, English and Spanish subtitle options, an optional narrative track for the blind, and an audio commentary by Marcus Hearn and actor George Cole. The audio commentary may seem a bit dry to American ears and the film isn't discussed all that much (more attention is focused on the careers of George Cole, Alastair Sim, and other cast members), but it's a welcome extra nonetheless. Disc Two features the colorized version of the film, which is unrestored and seems to be taken from a TV airing, including opening and closing host segments (which are rather nice, picture quality aside) by ""Avengers"" star Patrick MacNee (who has a small role in the film as young Jacob Marley). Now, most of us film buffs don't think much of colorization, however, I can see a bit of nostalgia to it now, being amongst the many who grew up during the period when TV presentations of holiday classics often were shown that way. Also on Disc Two are the audio options from the first disc (minus the commentary) and some other fine extras as well! We receive the original British and American theatrical trailers, a brief look at the restoration process for the black and white version of the film, a Photo and Press Book gallery (which runs on its own, something I rather appreciate, though some accompanying music would have been nice), a fine and rapid yet thorough look at the life and times of Charles Dickens, an interview with George Cole on the subject of Alastair Sim titled ""Spirit of Christmas Past,"" an audio interview with Richard Gordon on the subject of Renown Pictures and ""Scrooge"" producer George Minter, and, most delightfully, the 1935 Seymour Hicks version of ""Scrooge."" The only disappointment here is that the bonus film of Seymour Hicks' ""Scrooge,"" an excellent film in its own right, is not complete. I noticed one of its sweetest moments, the scene at the end where Ebenezer joins the Cratchits in church, was not there. This left me wondering what else might have been cut out, if anything, and deciding I would definitely be keeping my bargain bin edition of that film.Nevertheless, this 2-disc release from VCI, complete with lovely, opening flap slipcover, is the finest presentation of Alastair Sim's ""A Christmas Carol"" to date, and if you love this film and holiday films in general, you owe it to yourself to get it right away!"	5.0	A Perennial Holiday Favorite!

The print on it is faded and the color process is a bit fake looking. I can only hope that this new 2 disc edition from the same company is much better!....I would think so after 20 years.The film itself is considered a classic by many, but this particular version is dated and stagey! It's slow moving with Alastair Sim being the only shinning light! I never saw this version as a kid and I think that is why I'm a bit critical of it. I have no fond memories of this movie, although I love the story! For those of you who love this version, please enjoy it as much as you like! I won't be spending my holidays watching this film version ever again! My DVD version(the single disc VCI edition from 89') has a washed out transfer, bad coloring and not much in the way of extras, including a vintage cartoon version of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.

Alistair Sim is not a cartoon or caricature but a chillingly realistic Scrooge in his &quot;before&quot; incarnation, and his transformation is more profound and complete, into his wonderfully warm and touchingly humorous &quot;after&quot; character.  Avoid the colorized version -- the gloomy mood is best captured in black and white.	5.0	The definitive &quot;Christmas Carol&quot;	2002-12-26	5	5	0

We see him again when he shows up at Fred's home. In a version he hosted on TV, he talks about the movie. Look for it on broadcast TV during the Christmas Season. Even though in the version I am reviewing includes a colorized version, thanks to Ted Turner, who ruined other Black and White classics,that is not how true movie buffs like myself perfer to watch it.	5.0	Patrick MacNee	2009-12-04	1	1	0

It's a classic film, telling a classic story, and the adaptation is brilliant and near flawless. Alastair Sim gives an amazing performance, and all the other actors are gems, especially Kathleen Harrison as Mrs. Dilber, and Mervyn Johns as Bob Crachit. Michael Hordern is a superb Marley's Ghost, wailing and screaming enough to terrify Scrooge to shivering. The music is also an enormous asset, written by Richard Addinsell, and perfect for the film. See the film in black and white, turn on the original mono sound, and set it to the original 4x3 aspect ratio. Don't watch the widescreen version which crops the top and bottom of the original frame.

It seems like they show it less and less every year, and I have been disappointed with the previous year, as they didn't show it at all.  I love the black and white version, and there's also a colorized version, very well done, I might add.  They have an old old version of a Christmas Carol on this DVD, and that was an added plus.  It starred Sir Seymour Hicks, and I think it was about 1932.  Alastair Sim played a wonderful Scrooge, and I think he's the best by far.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1K4AVQIU704DY	"Nancy Sherburne ""a Phil Ochs fan"""	When I and my fraternal twin sister were young children, I remember staying up to watch this version and the one starring Reginald Owen. I could be wrong, but I think the Sim version was shown first, then Owen's, then Sim's again. They were both part of my growing-up years and I still enjoy them. When my sister gave this one to me for Christmas in the colorized version I wasted no time in putting it on. To watch again Ebeneezer refusing to allow his clerk to put more coal on the fire, or to exchange Christmas greetings with his nephew brougth back all the memories of this timeless classic. To hear again the loud shrieks of the ghost of Jacob Marley to prove to Ebeneezer he was not a figment of the man's imagination was very effective. To watch the crowds of other unhappy spirits and listen to their wailings was more sad than frightening. Each spirit visited Ebeneezer to show him the folly of his miserly ways and in the end he was a changed man. It was so heart-warming to see him giving his housekeeper a guinea for a Christmas present and a hug to boot. To watch Tiny Tim walk again (something omitted from the Owen's version) was a miracle. I feel those who have not seen any of the versions of Dickens' classic which I myself have never read are missing out on a lot, including a look at how old England celebrated Christmas. Now that I have it on DVD the magic can unfold at any time I feel like watching it, and hope it is added to many others' DVD libraries.	5.0	Not Just Another Version	2009-12-26	0	0	0

No matter how many filmed treatments of Dickens' classic there are, it seems none begin to do justice to the images formed in one's mind by the book's grim depictions of Victorian-era England.  The first thing one realizes in this particular version is director Brian Desmond-Hurst's ""time-marches-on"" approach (not to mention his total lack of pretentiousness--a factor which has ultimately felled all other treatments); as well as the screenplay frittering away no time whatsoever in getting to Scrooge's visits with the ghosts.  The penetration into the miser's past is the focal point of the film, and Sim's performance has a through-and-through logic that makes his exuberance on Christmas morning that much more palpable.  There's a mechanical nature to the character's near-recitation of his familiar lines at the start, but his sheer vulnerability (something distinctly lacking in, say, George C. Scott's portrayal) from then onward gives it perfect sense.  Sim is every inch the visual equal to his radio-Scrooge counterpart, Basil Rathbone.Other factors contribute towards making the film the complete triumph it is: things like the visit from the ghost of Christmas Present, and the scene in the future depicting Tiny Tim's death, which for once is truly heart-wrenching.It looks like the real thing; it sounds like the real thing; Lord knows it feels like it.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AIWDGRTLV7IQF	Patrick McCormack	This is one of the sharpest performances of a Christmas Carol you can own. The best of british actors bring the performance into England, into a Dickensian world. This, and the black and white version, give this movie an exotic flavor, a performance that is Christmas in a foreign land -- at least for this American reviewer.The package includes a colorized version, and the colorization is not bad. My kid liked the colorized version. But the black and white filmversion has more character.This is the version I grew up with. I have since seen a dozen versions, from a play at the Guthrie to Scrooged, from George C. Scott to Marlo Thomas, including the classic cartoon with Jim Backus... this performance takes the story seriously, is scary in the scary parts, and imparts a sense of joy at the conversion of Scrooge that resonates deeply, is believable, and makes me want to watch this movie again, next year, and the year after. I would put this next to A Christmas Story and It's A Wonderful Life on my shelf of Christmas films.By the way, this review also appears as an anonymous kid's review, for some reason.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3Q9GRG1WRVDH1	Patrick The Unsaved	The 1951 version of A Christmas Carol starring Alastair Sim as the skin flint Scrooge is hands down the greatest version ever brought to the screen, and I shall not dispute that, but the Blu Ray transfer is one of the grainiest, crappiest, worst transfers I have ever seen and a complete waste of money.  I find it very hard to believe that the producers of the Blu Ray version actually took the time to digitally enhance the original film as they claim.  My standard DVD version is a much better copy then this one would ever hope to be.  If you love this film as much as I do, then do yourself a favor and buy the standard DVD version instead, but do not waste your money on this extremely bad Blu Ray transfer.	3.0	Great film, but horrible Blu Ray transfer!	2010-12-19	8	2	6

Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol starting Alastair Sim is probably the best version that was ever produced.  Each  scene is brought to life by the actors that portray each character.  I have  watch this movie each Christmas Eve for the last 20+ years.  Now I have my  own copy so I can watch this movie any time.  This movie is a must for each  VCR or DVD Library.

There are moments when the audio is so bad, it sounds like it was re-recorded through a tin-can telephone! Fortunately (!?) the overall quality of the transfer is so slipshod that it is not consistent, so there are many scenes where the audio and video get as good as ""acceptable.""Generally, I make it a point to only purchase DVDs of old movies that clearly stipulate that they were remastered or newly transferred.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3AT23Y9QQ6JT5	"Paul J. Tomlin ""Music History Buff"""	The transfer of this classic to Blu-ray in not up to snuff.  When we buy blu-ray releases, regardless of how old the movie is, we expect them ready to be viewed in pristine Hi Def condition on the TV sets that we have purchased for that purpose.  This transfer is not.The picture is not awful, but neither, is it the quality expected in a blu-ray release.  It is sharper than on other releases.  The soundtrack on previous releases has sounded muddy with an echo.  Using the 5.1 option with surround sound system the sound seems improved without sounding as much like it was recorded at the bottom of an oil drum.The biggest problems are that the picture or action jumps and jerks in quite a few places throughout as though, as another reviewer mentioned, frames were omitted in the transfer.  Also, in a few spots there are bends or waves in the picture distorting the action.  When the viewer is really involved in the movie, these anomalies are a huge distraction and detract from the enjoyment of the story. Expectations run high with blu-ray, but these flaws are unexpected and a disappointment.	2.0	Poor Transfer	2009-12-27	6	4	2

The DVD cover lists it as &#34;Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, but the film was and is titled, SCROOGE.  I bought it from Amazon in a fit of nostalgia.  I'd seen it in its original 1951 release and my memory never let go of it.  Despite the fact that the film techniques of the time were crude compared to those we so blithely expect today, the film hold its wonder.  Alastair Sim outshines all the other (and some of them big names) actors who have taken on this role.  You simply cannot take your eyes from him.  And there isn't a false note among any of the supporting cast.  I would wish that everyone would get on to Amazon now and have this in home for a family viewing feast next Christmas - or at any other time of the year for that matter.  I stop now because there's no end to the raves I could on giving this extraordinary Amazon product!P the G.	5.0	A dickens of a film!	2013-01-07	0	0	0

The movie speaks for itself, but what this Ultimate Collector's Edition offers in terms of extras makes this worth every penny you spend on it, regardless of how many times you've seen the film. Rarely is a ""collector's edition"" of a film that's 50+ years old packed with this many great bonus features. The original trailers are always nice to have, and the before and after comparison of the film's restoration is truly telling. The colorized version is wonderful, and our children were delighted with it. We also get a poignant look back in time with the lives and careers of Alastair Sim, Charles Dickens, and George Minter remembered by those who worked with them and knew them well. Not to mention the audio commentary that's a perfect bonus for those who love this film. Overall, you can't go wrong with this Ultimate Collector's Edition two disc set.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A16IM9MYTHCKYQ	Penumbra	"Although this 1951 classic film takes some liberties with the Dicken's novel, it remains the film most faithful to the original story.  Some of the sets and costumes were directly inspired by the memorable illustrations in the first edition of the book.  Alastair Sim is very convincing as the miserly Scrooge who, after a terrifying night of ghostly visits,  is transformed into a man who knows how to keep Christmas in his heart.There have been many DVD editions of this holiday favorite in recent years, several of them from VCI Entertainment.  In this package, VCI has included some things featured on previous releases (commentary, Dickens biography, etc.), but the real star of this set is the beautifully restored version of the black and white film.  According to a short feature on the restoration of the film, VCI has  finally been able to obtain film elements from the original master.  Apparently they didn't have access to a complete master, so they used several of the best prints they could gather and digitally read them to determine which frames were the best available.  The rest was cleaned up by hand.  It sounds like a labor of love, and the result is visible on the screen. The restored print is available in 4x3 and 16x9 in 1:37:1 format. (According to the Amazon product description page, the aspect ratio is given as 1:87 and elsewhere as 1:33, the DVD box says 1:37.)  There are a few seconds of less than pristine audio, but overall this is a gorgeous effort.A nice touch I've never seen on a DVD before is an optional audio track for the blind, in which a narrator describes the action on the screen pausing for dialog from the actors.  A wandering commentary track with Marcus Heard and George Cole (young Scrooge) is included.  Much of the commentary is reprised in a feature interview by Heard in which Cole reminisces about Alastair Sim, ""Spirit of Christmas Past.""  The audio is in English only.  Subtitles are in English or Spanish.The second disc offers the original 1935 Seymour Hicks' film version of the story.  A colorized version of the 1951 film is also included on Disc 2; the brief introduction by Patrick McNee (young Marley) has been seen before on previous releases of the colorized version.  There are also theatrical trailers from the UK release (""Scrooge"") and the US release (""A Christmas Carol"").VCI has given us a beautiful package here.  They've done a great job with the restoration of a film treasure.  Many viewers will never have seen such a good print of this holiday favorite before.  The bonus features are a nice inclusion, but the restoration is the real reason to get this edition.  Highly recommended!"	5.0	Meticulous restoration of a holiday classic	2007-10-07	86	82	4

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2TYAL88IXRSEV	Peter Prainito	"Let me start by offering my sincerest apologies for having to be the first reviewer to rate the newly restored Blu-ray release of the classic 1951 ""A Christmas Carol""  less than the 5 stars everyone else has given it. This English movie version of the beloved Dickens tale has rightfully earned the respect and admiration that it gets. There has never been a better acted or more moving film adaptation than this one...hands down!Like so many other people who own some prior version of this classic, I was thrilled to learn that it was re-mastered on Blu-ray. I relied on these 6 favorable Amazon reviews to gain the confidence I needed to take a chance on purchasing this film, since it was hailed as looking and sounding better than it ever has. Despite some reviewers claiming that it was not without flaws, I took that chance. Well folks, when it comes to re-mastering older films it's a gamble. In my opinion, I felt I lost this bet. Yes, the film does seem brighter and in better focus. However I was not expecting to see the picture bending in certain frames or going in and out of focus between scene changes. I also did not expect to hear the obvious audio splices and drop-out like it did a few times. I'm not sure (or confident) that the re-mastering was made from the best possible sources; but if it was, then the sources have deteriorated horribly over time.I wasn't expecting miracles (perhaps this is the best that this movie can be made to look), but can only give this Blu-ray release a lukewarm recommendation. I still adore this movie and always will, flaws and all. Happy Holidays to you all!UPDATE: In response to a commentator of my review, I watched my older DVD version (also produced by VCI Home Video) and found that many of the defects that I mentioned were in the Blu-ray were non-existent in my older DVD. Notably, I'm referring to the bending and splices in the video and the audio drop-outs. Amazing! The Blu-ray improved the sharpness of the video but introduced defects at the same time. Clearly, the best sources were NOT used in the remastering."	3.0	I Don't Understand The Raves Over this Blu-ray....	2009-11-14	88	78	10

About seven years ago, I really watched it and fell in love.  Alastair Sim is untouchable as Scrooge (although, Sir Michael Caine and Kermit the Frog manage a very close second!).  I was very excited to watch this with my family over the holidays, but no joke, my mum's bag was stolen--which contained this DVD that I bought her three years ago (she had an old VHS version that was so worn out it pretty much skipped the entire time)--and we were both devastated!!  I had to buy this again, because my mum was super upset about losing it, and I've been dying to give it to her in person!  Also, I introduced my daughter to it last year (she was barely 7 months old), and she didn't cry--so I'll take that as a sign she's going to like it! ;)	5.0	A Third-Generation Family Tradition	2014-02-11	0	0	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3OWKT7JZV8NT9	Philip D. Parshall	I love Alistair Sim's characterization of Ebenezer Scrooge; I think he nails the multi dimensional Scrooge in a way no other actor has. But I find myself watching this version less and less every year. I think I'm a product of the computer age when special effects are more visually realistic and fascinating! Let's face it, the story 'A Christmas Carol' requires a certain amount of special effects and as much as I love the 1951 version, it's special effects with the hourglass, etc. are suboptimal (though probably amazing by 1951 standards). My ultimate version would be to take Sim as Scrooge and the characters from the 1951 version and drop them into the visually perfect Patrick Stewart movie along with assorted street sequences from the Shrewsbury location shoots from the George C. Scott version. Anyone agree with me?	5.0	The Best Scrooge!!	2007-11-28	3	1	2

Dickens did not write Scrooge, he wrote A Christmas Carol.  Two, Skip All Past 1951.  There is NO Modern A Christmas Carol Classic.  All the Modern Ones, past 1951 are just some actor (or would be Actor) self-indulgence with extra Dull and boring.  The Cartoons are better.Alastair Sim gives a great performance and understated.  Second, I would pick, A Christmas Carol (1938).Now having said everything, that I have, The Emerald Edition by Morningstar (UPC of 063634023586).  Amazon Emerald Edition $18.99.  VCI HOME VIDEO Format: BLU-RAY/DVD COMBO Release Date: 09 Nov 2010 Amazon A Christmas Carol (Blu-ray / DVD Combo) (1951) $49.95.  After Searching around today, while writing this review.  I came upon these reviews away from amazon on Blu Ray forums.  &#34;I noticed in a few places what looked like ghosting or maybe an interlace issue. I thought, can't be, it's 1080P/24. My PS3 is outputting 1080P/24&#34;, &#34;whatever you do, stay far, FAR away from the green covered Emerald Edition Blu-ray&#34;, Okay, &#34;there is some shimmering and frame skips&#34;.

Many of those actors went on to great careers in the movies, T.V. or in plays (Michael Hordern, Patrick Macnee, Hermione Baddeley, Mervyn Johns etc.)It was pretty obvious that this entire production was a labor of love from start to finish and it did justice to Dickens in a way that not other version of Scrooge ever has.	5.0	Outstanding, The Only Scrooge For Me	2013-11-12	0	0	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1SVXJZ3386U2D	Randy Keehn	After the Gosepl of Luke, the best Christmas story I've come upon is Charles Dickens's &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.  I have to admit that I've never actually read the book but I feel as if I know it for all the movie and TV versions of it that I have seen.  By far the best one the Alastair Sim version which is titled &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; but also shows up occassionally as &quot;Scrooge&quot; (the opening credits show &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and the closing credits show &quot;Scrooge&quot;).I am probably a bit biased in my preference for this version because it was the first one I saw.  As a young boy, I was very much impressed by the story and especially by Alastair Sim's portrayal of Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Sim doesn't have to yell or boil over to convey the right image.  His sneering looks of disdain and rude rebuttals are enough to give you the measure of the man.  Likewise, after his visit with the three Christmas spirits, his metamorphasis as a redeemed believer is a joy to watch.  The way his joy bubbles over in his giddy behavior is most memorable.  The other actors, mostly unknown names to American movies audiences, all fit their roles very well.The special effects are about what you could expect from a 1951 English movie.  However, that is just as well because the story, not the visual effects, are what we are focussed on.  After all, the beauty of Dickens's story doesn't require any glitz.  I feel that this version does the best job of delivering story that to the audience.  If you haven't seen it before, you really need to.  Don't be put off by the black and white film, enjoy the story as it was meant to be presented.	5.0	THE Christmas Movie	2003-12-26	2	1	1

Throughout this version Sim manages to bring forth a much more human and sympathetic Scrooge.  From Scrooge's nervous attempts at humor while dealing with the ghost of his former partner Jacob Marley, to his uncontrollable sobbing and eventual mirth and shear joy upon his realization that he hasn't missed Christmas and still possesses the ability to make amends, Sim does a powerful job.  His intonations, gestures and facial expressions go so much deeper than simply exploding in various fits of rage.  Marley, though reprehensible, is shown as a remorseful soul, but when Scrooge just doesn't seem to grasp the message, Marley lets loose with perhaps the most haunting wail I have ever heard.  Scrooge's visit to Fred's Christmas party is also one of the most touching scenes I've ever witnessed on screen.  This version remains my favorite.  Merry Christmas, and God bless us, everyone!	5.0	As hoped for	2013-12-19	2	2	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A16FSLD5GQ600M	Raymond J. Pelissier	"Renown Pictures LTD from England: 'SCROOGE': I've submitted a review of this film a couple years ago in which I entitled it 'The Ultimate Scrooge'. A number of reviewers found it very helpful.  This production (in England called 'Scrooge', and in the release in the USA called 'A Christmas Carol'), was produced and released in 1951. It has to be at the  top of the list of seasonal movies right up there with 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'Miracle on 34th Street', 'A Christmas Story' and other memorable movies of various genres. I won't mention the actors that were in the film  other than the lead Alistair Sim, but what I found, after browsing Wikipedia, was the history of those actors; many of them lived long lives and appeared in both  motion pictures and TV.  If you haven't seen it, either the original B&W or the 1989 colorized version, you don't know what you're missing.  Again- this film should be seasonal viewing for EVERYONE!  It is timeless, as is the message of Christmas. And I just recently received (from Amazon via my brother-in-law) the 2-volume DVD set (B&W and color) of this film.  The colorized version is very well done.  Again- this movie ought to be seen by everyone, any time- not just the Christmas Season.  As the 'Ghost of Christmas Present' says in the movie:  ""The Child born in Bethlehem does not live in the hearts of men one day a year, but all 365 days"" (or something like that).  Take it to 'heart'?"	5.0	The 'best of the best'.	2008-01-02	0	0	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AE45DLBXKY798	RB	Loved this remastered version of the movie! It's definitely clearer, and it almost seems to be in 3D. The soundtrack is much more distinct as well. This is the best of all the versions of this story, and to have it in a clearer format makes quite a difference! The interview with the young Scrooge character is interesting at points, but can be laborious...after all, the gentleman is well into his 80s and sounds tired of talking occassionally. The free version of the 1938 version is strange and nothing like any other version I've seen; it has a few moments that are pretty affecting, but on the whole, it's just weird. I think the remastered version is well worth the money! I can't watch it without crying every time--the performances are just that good.	5.0	The best Christmas Carol version by far	2012-01-16	0	0	0

I am very glad I am old enough to not expect every movie to be in color.  To me, besides the wonderful acting and, of course, the timeless story, the  black and whiteness actually adds to the picture, to the dreariness of Scrooge's life before that fateful night.  The merry parts, yet, are no less merry for it being in B&W.;No, I have not seen every single version of ""Christmas Carol,"" nor have I wanted to.  This version is the one, to me.

Scott 1984 version of this story, this one always seemed like ancient history to me, having been made 19 years before I was born.  I finally broke down and bought it, thinking I may have been wrong, what with all the people saying it is the ""standard.""  Sadly, I was right all along, at least as far as my tastes and sensibilities go.  This is a classic for the geezers to watch and think of their childhood fondly and more power to them!  Also, as much as I hate black and white films, the colorized version seems worse to me.  They colorized Marley's clothing!  He's a ghost, for heaven's sake!  Don't they know ghosts are whitish-grey, even in color movies?!As for me, I'm going to keep watching the George C. Scott version and the equally good Patrick Stewart version.  George C. Scott will always be Scrooge in my mind's eye, but the casting in the 1999 Patrick Stewart version is superior to all that I have seen.  As opposed to this one, which has Bob Cratchit as portly and the gentlemen who come to his office asking for donations, which are described as ""portly"" in the book, as thin!  Did they actually read the book, other than for dialogue?If you like black and white christmas movies, stick to ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" since it hasn't been re-done over a dozen times."	2.0	"Underwhelming - The ""standard"" for geezers, maybe"	2005-12-06	61	5	56

I can see textures in clothing I've never seen before, as well as detail in shadows that were lacking in previous releases. The sound is 100% improved (even the Dolby Surround is effective). While there is some footage that is a bit degraded it quite minimal and accounts for only a minute or two of the entire film.Overall, a great restoration job!	5.0	True restoration	2008-11-23	12	11	1

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2YZTFJ04M8ELD	R. Kramp	"This version of ""A Christmas Carol"" certainly captures the true essence of the Charles Dickens novel. It's a good story of redemption - my favorite Dickens story. It depicts very well the horror of poverty and emptiness of wealth. The story is still relevant today, if not more so. It also certainly makes a person think.Many people would be something like Scrooge, not just among the rich. There would also be some people not keeping Christmas not because they don't want to, but due to being loners.Even in those days there was mention of the surplus population. I guess one could say that also makes the story more relevant today.The movie didn't have journeys in the present, showing various groups celebrating Christmas, as in the book. An exception is with miners. It's probably because of time limitations.Charles Dickens believed strongly in the supernatural. I think his depictions of it, including other realms like the astral, are quite accurate. This includes what one sews in the physical, one reaps in the afterlife.This movie has been colorized. There has been dislike and controversy about it. I don't see what's wrong with that, using broadmindedness and not being conservative about it. It's an improvement on the old movie. (Just not of silent movies.) That's like an improvement on e.g. the 3 original Star Wars movies. That's also much like with the modern animated version of ""A Christmas Carol"" (2009). I prefer to watch the colorized versions of these movies. It also looked like this movie was originally filmed in color. It's good that this DVD also contains that version. Then, the individual viewers can decide for themselves which they want to watch. Others usually don't contain the colorized versions, and should. That's movies like Julius Caesar (1953), Casablanca (1942), etc.We should strive to be more like Scrooge at the end of the movie, with the Christmas spirit, and not be so money-orientated. We can then be more in the kind of world we'd want to live in - the microcosm affecting the macrocosm."	3.0	Good portrayal.	2009-12-05	4	3	1

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	For the umpteenth time VCI has re-released A Christmas Carol in a,now called,Diamond Edition.They have even enlisted the talent of movie critic Leonard Maltin to introduce the film to give them more street cred and added some extras like silent versions of the film and a new 5.1 Dolby surround sound along with the original mono,and on and on.The print that many others have raved about DOES look excellent,to a point.I actually kind of re-discovered the film all over again,that is how good the picture looked.I even saw for the first time the legendary man in the mirror.If you aren't aware of the story,a stage hand is visible in mirror Sims looks into Christmas morning.Here's the nitty-gritty.Let's start by saying that the menu is not user friendly at all.There is no option to skip Maltin's intro,you have to push forward for that.If you go into the options menu there is a list for the commentary,the different sound options,etc.If you hit one,for example the commentary,there is no way to stop it but to come back there and hit something else like a sound option!The film is shown in a boxed form.There are two black bars running horizontally top and bottom(like widescreen),then there are two vertical bars on either side of the picture,so the film is seen in its original a/r,not an entire full screen format(i.e. fitted to your TV screen).This is alright per se',but I will now list the defects that occur and leave the speculation as to what causes them(either poor film elements,the digital process or a manufacturers defect)to YOU.Throughout the film there are periodic white flashes along the side black bars,at one point on the far right side of the frame a distortion bar appears running vertically from top to bottom of the film,there are constant slight jumps in the film,the scene where Marley's ghost throws open Ebeneezers' door to enter,the door blurs as it opens and Ebeneezer blurs as he quickly steps-back,and finally comes the scene where two women and an undertaker are trying to sell off dead Scrooge's belongings.At one point as the second woman speaks her dialogue it cuts out completely,as her mouth continues to move,then cuts back in as her dialogue quickly catches back up to her mouth.A strange glitch.What is even stranger is that I thought I would watch the movie with the commentary on at that point,and from what I heard there is NO cut out of dialogue at that exact moment,during the commentary.Now,go figure that one out!I can only ask VCI one thing,where is the quality control here? Does anyone there actually watch the finished product or is it just rush it out and cash in?And speaking of VCI,this is the second product of theirs in the last month I have reviewed and the other didn't fair well either because of VCI's cheap packaging which compromised the integrity of the discs inside.If you have seen Maltin's intro you will have noticed(coincidence?)two figurines to his left.They were Laurel and Hardy and the set of their films VCI released so terribly,is what I refer to.So my final thoughts are these.VCI,after repeated releases,have finally released a half way decent print of this film but,as you have read,it is terribly fraught with glitches and defects throughout.My advice is to hold out and hope either 1)VCI gets their quality control act together and releases a much more professional and consumer friendly DVD product or 2)someone else comes along and beats them to the punch.Either way give this one a big pass.	1.0	Diamond edition?It's more like Cubic Zirconia!	2011-12-07	23	14	9

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3PF7P29C1JWCD	"Robert J.

As others have noted, I used to scour the TV guide every week from Thanksgiving on to find a time to enjoy this film.The best element of this film, which is shared by the Teledrama with George C Scott is the serious nature of the pre repentant Scrooge.The Muscial Scrooge with Albert Finney makes him a comic character. This is shared by a great version with George Bacchus as the voice in Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol.In this sense, I prefer the George C Scott version, filmed during the Wall Street era of the 80's, where Scrooge is well groomed, intelligent, and flawed. He is the consumate conservative businessman of both Dickens time, and our own.I enjoy and own both versions.	5.0	One of my favorites.	2007-12-16	0	0	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A4UGMKUSX9XHI	Robert Stone	"This has always been my favorite version of this classic story, with apologies to George C. Scott, Jim Carey, Patrick Stewart, and even Scrooge McDuck. All the other versions are fine pieces of work as well (I enjoy all of them) but somehow this version always seemed the best to me - in large part due to it being in black and white and the very stark, cold look the director imbued the film with. Alastair Sim does an absolutely terrific job in bringing the viewer into his character; he plays the role in such a way that even in the very early scenes he elicits just a trace of sympathy (perhaps pity?) from the audience which allows one to immerse oneself in his adventure to a great extent. Now this classic comes to Blu-Ray.The quality of the Blu-Ray is certainly not what some who have reviewed it were expecting and though I respect those opinions I suspect this is more a matter of source material rather than a poorly implemented transfer. This movie was shot in a very dark, high-contrast way which I am certain was intentional and is quite appropriate as this adds to the foreboding mood. The dark sets clearly required the director to ""push"" film technology to the limit which resulted in much more film grain than is seen in most features. This film grain is clearly visible on this Blu-Ray and this is not a look familiar in other discs. The lack of perfect definition does not seem to be an artifact of a poor transfer but a limitation in the 35 mm negative which was reportedly used to produce this disc. The only alternative is to digitally remove the film grain with DNR (digital noise reduction), and I am VERY happy they did not do that!I do not have a DVD version with which to compare but there are several scenes which looked totally different from what I have seen in the past on television. The best example was the scene when Scrooge has arrived home and is locking his doors (he double or triple locks both his front door and his bedroom door!) - during this fairly extensive scene I vividly recall wondering what was going on in the past since in versions shown on TV there is sometimes almost nothing visible except for Scrooge's almost ghostly face along with the candle he is carrying. In the Blu-Ray, by contrast (pun intended), the scene is full of interest with the bannister and stairs and shadows from windows in a fan-shaped pattern on the floor. Much later, after Scrooge's ""awakening"" (literally and figuratively), the snow-filled scenes on Christmas morning also look better than ever with a vibrancy which I have not seen on past views. I got the feeling watching this disc that this level of definition has not been seen since this was in the theaters in 1951.I have read a couple criticisms of this disc including an automatically-running advertisement for other releases by the same company which follows the words ""Don't touch the remote"" or some such as soon as the disc is inserted. Some noted that they were forced to watch this presentation as their remotes would not forward past it. I found that at least on my Sony Blu-Ray player I could simply select menu and was able to immediately play the feature. I also read about some subtle video anomalies at certain points in the film on the informational site blu-ray.com (this is not a sales site). I actually checked out the spots they referred to and to say the least the anomalies are very subtle, I would never have noticed them without the heads-up. They may be more visible on a PS3 (as the author of that review noted).In summary, I am very pleased with this purchase and recommend this film without reservation."	5.0	The definitive Scrooge comes to Blu-Ray	2010-11-21	10	9	1

This version has the most complete story of how Scrooge came to become a mean old miser.  There is plenty of detail in his journey back in time with the Ghost of Christmas Past.  I think the most enjoyable part of the movie is Scrooge's behavior on Christmas morning.  It is a brilliant piece of acting.

Scott, and Albert Finney to Henry Winkler and even good ol' Bill Murray, to name just a few.  But while so many variations of A Christmas Carol has been seen, only one can truly be experienced, and that is this version starring Alastair Sim.  Alastair portrays Scrooge like no other as, or perhaps ever will.  Christmas cannot be complete without this classic.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3TOQAMJURAYFC	Roland Dark	Simply the definitive version of Charles Dickens' beloved classic &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.  Alastair Sim delivers a delicious, flawless, once in lifetime performance as that pitiful old piker, Ebenezer Scrooge, injecting the vital element of dimensionality into the character, an element scarcely seen in other versions.  The primary motivation for Scrooge's unsavory demeanor is not something as superficial as the thirst for wealth.  No, Scrooge's hatred is the result of something deeper, more intrinsic, more human.  Sim masterfully establishes this fact with acute understanding of the character.  Everything from the manner in which he walks to the way he forms his words is given the proper nuance, yielding an entirely convincing and empathic performance.  I have often thought Alastair must have been temporarily possessed by Dickens' mind to have pulled it off!If Alastair's performance were all there was to offer, it would be enough to make this an instant classic.  But this version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is blessed with superb performances from the entire cast.  Everyone from the Ghost of Jacob Marley to Tiny Tim seem to have been personally handpicked by Dickens' himself!  The period detail is flavorful, the score fitting.  With all due respect to Charles, even the liberties taken with the story are an improvement on the book!  Charles Dickens would be proud!&quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and its message are something we all can believe in and enjoy, regardless of religion. It is truly a tale that should not be enjoyed one day of the year, but all 365!Oh...  I almost forgot!  &quot;Bah, humbug!&quot;... &quot;God bless us, everyone.&quot;  Couldn't resist!	5.0	Definitive Film Version of Charles Dickens' Timeless Classic	2002-03-01	7	7	0

No one else even comes close to Alastair Sim as Scrooge. He will always BE Scrooge for me!  I make it a point to watch this version every year -- Christmas just wouldn't be complete without it -- and I'm going to order this DVD for Christmas 2006.No matter how many times I've seen this movie (and it's a lot of times, b/c this movie and I were born in the same year!), I always get teary-eyed at the end when Tiny Tim runs up to Scrooge and you hear the narrator speak the closing lines.  It may be terribly sentimental of me, but I really have a soft spot for this movie.I agree with some of the other reviewers who said ""A Christmas Carol"" is one of the greatest and most important stories ever written. It has probably been remade more than any other fictional story. I doubt that Charles Dickens ever would have believed that this little book would become such an important fixture of the Christmas season!  Even if this had been the only book he had ever written, he could be proud of the legacy he has left to the world.If there is possibly anyone out there who has never seen Alastair Sim's Scrooge, you have GOT to see this movie!

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1LHAXBM5GBJS2	Scooter McGavin	Certainly we have all seen A Christmas Carol before is some form or another, whether it be a faithful version of the Charles Dickens classic or a more modern telling of the story by the Muppets or like Bill Murray in Scrooged.  So reviewing the film is kind of silly, you know what you are getting in that respect.  What is important to know about this DVD set is what you will be getting with the greatest Christmas fable and how you are getting it.In this 1951 Alastair Sim version, you get three different versions of the film on the two disk Ultimate Collector's Edition; there is the remastered black and white version (which has an accompanying audio commentary by Marcus Hearn and George Cole) in both full screen and widescreen as well as the colorized version in the widescreen format.  It is wise to stick with the black and white (which is digitally restored as seen in a special feature) because the color looks like your basic looks like they painted each frame type of colorized version of the film.  Then as an added bonus, they also threw in the 1935 version of Scrooge.Also included on the DVD's are interviews with George Cole about Alastair Sim as well as one with Richard Gordon about George Minter and Renown Pictures, both lasting over ten minutes.  There is also a short on Charles Dickens himself as well as Cast Bios, Photo and Press Book Gallery as well as trailers for both the 1935 film and the 1951 version.  In the end, the film is a timeless classic that any family can watch together during the holiday season.	5.0	A Must Have Holiday Treat	2007-10-05	3	2	1
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AR1T36GLLAFFX	Scott FS	I'm a big fan of 'A Christmas Carol', and I've seen most of the film versions many times.  I like George C. Scott's portrayal of Scrooge a lot.  That 1998 production has a much better look than the 1951 Alistair Sim's version.  The colors are rich and vibrant, the special effects superior, and the secondary characters are well acted.  Patrick Stewart's is also a good film.Then why do I prefer this version better?  Somehow, it seems truer to the time when Dickens wrote the story.  It was filmed in a post-war Britian that was still very much recovering from the tremendous economic dislocations that World War II brought.  The actors seemed more in tune somehow with the bleak late 19th century that was Dicken's time.  In the Scott version, everyone looked, well, too well-fed. And too warm.  Seriously.You can feel the chill of Scrooge's bed chambers when Alistair Sim plays the tightwad.  You identify with Scrooge saving his coal, and tightening his collar. You can understand the real thrill that would accompany the dividing up of his few goods after Scrooge died.  The cemetary that the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come takes Scrooge to seems more cold, dark, and lonely.And Sims inhabits the role better than Scott.  Hard to say that, since Scott was one of the finest actors in the twentieth century, but Scott just doesn't have the absolute glee that Sims has when he discovers he has survived to see another Christmas Day.  Sim literally dances with joy!  The transformation is convincing, and the range Sim shows it superb.  The contrition Sims shows when confronted with his life seems genuine. And I liked the nephew and his family a lot better in the Sims version.  They seemed more authentic and truer to Victorian England.Please, please, please stay away from the colorized version.  It's OK, but the film was made in B&W; and it should be seen as filmed.  BTW, this film is actually titled 'Scrooge'.Very highly recommended. A must-see at Christmas.	5.0	Beats Scott's Version by a Whisker	2004-12-24	13	11	2
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A20JPNZTRS8LFS	Scott Schiller	"I just received this DVD and am impressed with the quality of this version. The source is from the original British print (""Scrooge"") and for a film 50+ yrs. old is in very nice shape. There are a few speckles and a scratch or two on the original source film, but I am very pleased overall. The opening and closing by Patrick Macnee is nice but dated, he states that this 1951 movie is only 38 yrs old. My biggest complaint is that the DVD option screens are difficult to read as the green lettering is hard to read on the backgrounds. Also the white type used in the CAST/ PRODUCTION NOTES section is tiny and hard to read as well. The Max Fleischer cartoon is OK, but not great- scratches, sound dropoffs. Max Fleischer's Superman cartoons are much better. Overall, I'm very happy with this DVD.

Allistair Sim is the best Scrooge ever. His portrayal is the standard to which all that follow try to match up too and often fall short. The black and white version is the best. It gives it a feel of a ghost story. This is a timeless classic for the whole family to see. It just wouldnt be christmas with out it.	5.0	THE DEFINITIVE CHRISTMAS CLASSIC	2010-09-23	3	2	1
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1P8D7UI9OMUDR	Sebastian	I always loved this story and this '51 version is definitely the best. And this latest edition is the best presention of that version. The restoration is excellent. There are three versions. Two with different diffentions. It is like I was watching it for the first time. The third one is in color. I like the b/w versions better but still interesting to see it in color again. Again with the new restoration like seeing it for the first time. The fourth and last version is the '35 version. Not even a comparision to the '51 version but interesting to watch as well, just around one hour in length. It has not aged well but still worth at least one viewing. I watched all four versions the first weekend I received it from Amazon. A lot of extras; all interesting. You have to see one of the '51 versions with George Cole commentary. He plays the young Scoorge and was close to  Alastair Sims in real life, very interesting. This and the Wizard of OZ I never get tired of viewing.

For my family and me this is the quintessential Christmas Carol.  Sim delivers a moving portrait of Scrooge, his laughter becomes contagious, his despotism convincing.  For me, there is no other version that will match this.  All of the characters from Bob and Mrs. Cratchet, ""and all the assorted little Cratchets"" deliver a convincing and moving performance.One thing to remember is that all the accents in this film are British.  Isn't that the way it should be?  Many remakes simply don't have the authenticity.  This is a family keepsake."	5.0	Review from Downingtown, PA	2004-12-08	6	4	2

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2TOU0N8XE68W4	Simon Davis	This superb movie is a Christmas Eve tradition in my home. It is the definitive Christmas movie guaranteed to warm your heart and restore all the wonderful Christmas feeling in you.Alistair Sim is of course superb as Scrooge, the famous old miser created by Charles Dickens, who has his faith in people and life in general restored one Christmas Eve when he is visited by three spirits. What is so wonderful about this story, and indeed also as a result of Sim's superb performance, is that Scrooge ultimately comes across as a tragic figure who you can't help feeling for totally by movie end. The scenes from his past are in particular very moving and indeed tragic and go a long way to explaining why Scrooge has ended up bitter with the world in generalAll the performances are top rate and the production itself is lavish and very authentic bringing alive a Victorian Christmas in London complete with snow, children singing carols, gas lamps etc all those things you see on traditional Christmas Cards nowadays.While there have been many other superb versions of this great story, this version is by far and away the best of the lot. If you buy one film for your collection this year make sure it is the Alistair Sim version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; you will never regret purchasing it and year after year it will fill you and your home with Christmas spirit and good cheer	5.0	A Christmas classic not to be missed	2002-03-05	8	7	1

I believe that this dvd version is the best for its interpretation of Scrooge's encounter with the Ghost of Jacob Marley. To quote the book: ""There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate.""  All the other versions try to ease the impact on the audience of Jacob Marley's horrible life after death. In so doing cause the audience to miss a important part of the story.  This rendering enables a better understanding Jacob Marley's death and suffering in a such way that the audience comes away with a much better impression of the good that occurs to Scrooge."	5.0	A Christmas Carol (Ultimate Collector's Edition)(B/W & Color) by Alastair Sim	2009-02-04	1	1	0

This has the film in it's original black & white print, well restored and preserved thank god! As well as the film colourised, which i think in this instance is done well.The DVD extras here are very good. The interview with actor George Cole is good to hear as he reminisces about working with Alistair Sim, and the film's director Brian Hurst.I believe that Alistair Sim's Scrooge is the best characterization of Scrooge ever put on film. I feel the same way about the whole film in fact.Some of Alistair's best scenes are at the end of the film, when he is ecstatically happy.George Cole here plays Ebenezer Scrooge as a younger man, and he really is just a faint glimmer - if that, of his famous television character in later years of Arthur Daley in 'Minder'.The 2nd disc has the much earlier 1935 Seymour Hicks version of Scrooge, which I must admit I haven't watched yet due to being very busy - but i look forward to it.The feature commentary with Marcus Hearn and George Cole is very informative and interesting as well.	5.0	Why wouldn't you?	2010-07-27	2	1	1

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	AJXSPUA2QU3UC	S. Rozell	"Originally review 2009: When I ordered this, I was under the impression that because it was older and well-reviewed on Amazon, it had to be better than other versions. My assumption was incorrect.The first downside of the video is the sound: ""Tinny"" and stereotypical for the day. If you are someone that loves how sound amplifies the images, then this lacking in that regard. George C Scott's version has much more haunting music.The second bummer in this version is the lousy depiction of the 1st 2 ""visitors."" Marley is nearly hysterical in his attempt to be scary. As I showed this to 5th graders who have listened to the actual novel, I felt embarrassed as I watched Marley's humorously pained expressions. The ghost of Christmas past leaves no impression on the viewer despite the length of its visit (this leads to my 3rd point).The Third weakness is the overemphasis on the 1st ghost: 45 minutes!! Much of the background from the intro (1st Stave) is covered under the 1st ghost and it felt like a violation to someone who has read the novel 8+ times. The 2nd Spirit is a solid character, but he is only in the show for less than 10 minutes! I could hardly believe the cameo role this spirit played. They did not even visit the nephew, the men in the lighthouse or at sea which was are important sections in understanding the breadth of the ""present"" in the novel.The last weakness is the main characters and in the development of some of the supporting cast. Alastair Sim is dry like Dickens' Scrooge, but there's not much more about him that is interesting. Scott and Patrick Stewart had depth in addition to the austerity. Another bothersome character is Scrooge's niece as she puts her face next to his in the finale. The problem is, she was hardly developed and yet her acceptance of him seemed like the climax to the plot in and of itself.Overall, this is not a 4 1/2 star movie. It may deserve 3 stars as it is old, but I wanted to make sure that there was some balance to those who gave it high regard for a reason that was not apparent to myself.Added 2011: I'm wondering if what I received was actually a shortened version of what others, some of whom attacked the original review, hailed as the classic. The sound quality was awful and the movie seemed cut. It could very well be that my review is of a different, less than ""Ultimate,"" version of the older releases?"	2.0	Maybe this is a changed version?	2009-12-18	20	5	15

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2IG2FG7L85RMU	Stanley H. Nemeth	"Dickens, particularly because of ""A Christmas Carol,"" has sometimes been categorized as an unbearably sentimental religious radical. What is remarkable about this superb British film is its skillful avoidance of any easy sentimentality. Happily then, in this hard-headed version, we don't see, for instance, what sometimes happens in other, treacly adaptations, the enlightened Scrooge himself late in the film bringing a turkey or goose to Tiny Tim's Christmas dinner. It's sufficient that Scrooge orders its delivery from a street urchin for a price. Further, we are shown in depth the psychological background which helped create Ebenezer Scrooge, a dreadfully narrow man of business who could be considered, perhaps, the original MBA, or Gordon Gekko of his era.The DVD Collectors' Edition has been justly praised for including 4 versions of the film, 2 in noble black and white, and the other 2 in meretricious color. Thus, there's something here for everyone's taste, no matter how fine or misguided. The edition also features a winning interview with the excellent comic actor George Cole, who discusses his work with Alastair Sim, the marvelous Scrooge, and makes one hunger for remastered versions of the St. Trinians films as well as the oddly neglected, riotously funny, ""Green Man.""And now to Sim, the principal delight of this version. With his bulging eyes, toothy grimaces of fright, and plummy voice, he surpasses all other screen portrayers so far of this initially nasty convert. I suspect if Dickens had been lucky enough to see Sim's performance, he would have raved along with the rest of us."	5.0	A  Review  NOT From The Vine Program	2007-10-27	5	4	1

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2VP7JOT3K7PFM	"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie"""	"+++++Many people know this story written in 1843 by Charles Dickens (1812-1870).  Old Ebenezer Scrooge, the meanest miser in London, overworks and underpays his clerk, Bob Cratchit, whose small son, Tiny Tim, is crippled and may soon die.  On Christmas Eve, Scrooge has a vivid nightmare.  He is visited by three ghosts who change his life forever.This 1951 movie (originally filmed in black and white) that's about 88 minutes long is entitled (as the movie's opening credits indicate and despite what the DVD package states) ""Scrooge in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.""Of all similar movies made, this one stays closest to Dickens' original story.  You can see this right at the beginning of the movie where we are shown a cover page from a manuscript that's written in Old English font.  On this page it says: ""Stave I: Marley's Ghost.""  Dickens divided his ""Carol"" into musical staves rather than chapters.  Then the narrator utters one of the most famous sentences in English literature: ""Old Marley was as dead as a doornail.""  The story then unfolds from this point on.What really makes this story come alive (and makes the movie a classic) is Alastair Sim's performance as Scrooge (not to mention the fine supporting performances).  It seems that Sim's Scrooge is not so much haunted by actual ghosts as tormented by inner demons; the ghosts are ""analysts"" who force him to confront his traumatic self.  Once this confrontation is complete, we see Scrooge's monumental transformation into joy.  (It's this transformation that Sim the actor does so well.)  The emotional impact of his delirium of joy is actually cathartic for the movie viewer as well, filling the viewer with good feelings.It should be mentioned that it's important to view this movie in black and white because this seems to aid the powerful emotional impact of Scrooge's (as played by Sim) transformation into joy.  For some reason, this impact is lost when the movie is in color.The strong background music for this movie seems to add to each scene.  As well, the sets are visually stunning.  They spread before us a vivid picture of nineteenth century London.One of my favorite scenes in the movie occurs after Scrooge's transformation.  He visits his nephew Fred's home where a party is underway.  This scene also has great emotional impact on the movie viewer.  We also get to see Scrooge's (as well as Sim's) polka dancing talent.In conclusion, be sure to see this magical movie.  By doing so, the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Christmas Yet To Come will cast their powerful spell on you also!!+++++"	5.0	This Movie is No HUMBUG!!	2003-12-03	11	10	1

After years of frustration, here is a terrific transfer with picture and sound better than I suspect many people saw and heard when this film was first seen in theaters. I'm glad I bought this Blu-Ray disk even though I already had last year's Blu-Ray transfer. This has gorgeous grays, solid blacks, fantastic detail and (finally!) crisp audio.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2W6NTOQG5JEGV	Stryker	Every year, for several years, this has been the one Christmas movie that I never fail to watch during the holidays (at least once).  This is the best adaptation of A Christmas Carol that I have ever seen.  Alastair Sim provides an excellent portrayal of Scrooge.  The black &amp; white filming adds to the whole &quot;Classic&quot; feel of the movie (avoid any colorizations). Buy it on DVD to ensure many, many years of quality viewing.The only downfall to the DVD (unless I'm missing something) is that the listed &quot;Special Features&quot; don't seem to be there.  There is no introduction by Patrick Macnee or Bonus Technicolor cartoon feature.  The Cast Bios consist of Alastair Sim only.  Don't worry about that small lack of quality.  The movie is worth owning if your a Scrooge fan.  Buy it. You will not be disappointed.	5.0	The Best of the Bunch	2003-01-05	1	0	1
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A36ER94271DHJZ	"stryper ""stryper"""	"Apparently, either I got a bad copy of this DVD, or people are not noticing how unevenly, ""Restored"", this new DVD is (and I know my DVD is okay, because I bought one for a friend, and his is the same quality as mine).The worst part of this new DVD's picture, is that it's not consistent, in that it goes from phenomenally amazing, to bargain basement DVD quality, on and off, throughout the entire film.It almost looks like they only had so much money to fix the print with (a print that was hodge-podge together from several sources, according to the manufacturer) and so, left the clean up only about 85% finished, which wouldn't have been half as bad if entire scenes where left unrestored, but instead what we get, are cuts in the same scene, that go from pristine to a jittery, computerized mess (like when you try and download a video, using a 14k dial up modem, on a 366MMX computer, with a 2mb video card) all within the span of a few seconds.Every time this happens, it jolts you out of the movie, and has you only thinking about the bad 3 seconds that just appeared in the print (it's kind of like listening to a record, for those of you who know, and have listened to one, that has a couple of scratches on it, and how it interrupts the flow of the music when the loud, ""POP"", sounds).Also of considerable note, is the fact that the 1935 version of, ""Scrooge"", staring Seymour Hicks, not only looks as if there was 72 years of accumulated filth left on the negative, causing the movie to have a very dark veil over the whole print, making it almost unwatchable, but is NOT, as the package says, the ""Complete Classic Feature Film"", as the complete film runs 78 minutes, where as this version runs only 60 minutes, which means that there are 18 minutes of cut scenes, most of which are needed for the viewer to appreciate just how good this version really is, being a very close second, to the Alistair Sims classic (in my humble opinion).Lucky for me, I found a $3.99 copy of the Hicks, ""Scrooge"", at Wal-Mart last year, with a substantially better picture quality, and at the full 78 minute running time.I also still have the original VCI DVD of, ""A Christmas Carol"", which, although not as sharp as most of the new DVD's picture quality, it is at the very least, consistent throughout.Let's hope that in 2 or 3 years, when VCI puts out their, UBUR, ""A Christmas Carol"", they finally get the restoration right :)"	2.0	RESTORED...???	2007-12-06	16	12	4

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2ZHH7AK83JB5G	"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling"""	Alastair Sim is the reason to watch this 1951 version of Charles Dicken's Victorian Christmas classic as he really brings the old miser, Scrooge, to life in a believable manner.  The film is quite faithful to Dicken's original story and it expands on some themes from Scrooge's past that are just hinted at in the book.  We even get to see Marley as a young man at his first meeting with his future business partner in the Christmas past  sequence as well as getting some insight in to why Scrooge resents his nephew when he had been so fond of his sister.  The film is presented on a two disc set with plenty of interesting extras and the viewer has the choice of watching the rather cheap looking colorized version (I started watching that first which was probably a mistake) or the well restored black and white original.  Why then do I not give it five stars?  Though this version is very worthy I can think of three other available CHRISTMAS CAROL versions I prefer.  My favorite is the one starring George C. Scott, my next is the often overlooked version of the musical SCROOGE starring Albert Finney and the third, believe it or not, is the excellent Mr. Magoo cartoon which was my first ever introduction to THE CHRISTMAS CAROL and I still enjoy that too little seen classic with my family every holiday season.	4.0	Alastair Sim's Performance As Scrooge Is The Reason To Watch!	2007-09-29	1	1	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A303U1MOXG5R1F	Sylviastel	This diamond edition features an introduction by Leonard Maltin, a noted Hollywood film historian and contributor to Entertainment Tonight, before the actual film. The film is black and white. Even without color, the film is quite in tradition of Dickens in London of the 1840s. It's grim, depressing, and dark but it's supposed to be.Ebenezer Scrooge played brilliantly by the late great character actor, comedian, and genius performer, Alastair Sim, is in the title role. Every Scrooge since then has been compared to him and it's easy to see why. He's Oscar winning gold in his performance perhaps one of the finest roles in film history for an actor. The cast of characters included Mervyn Johns who played Bob Cratchit; Hermione Baddeley who played his wife; Kathleen Harrison as his housekeeper; Michael Hordern played the older Jacob Marley; Patrick Macnee played the younger Marley; George Cole played the younger Scrooge; Hattie Jacques even has a small part.The film's cast and the director, Alan Desmond Hurst, are brilliant in displaying the harshness of Scrooge's time. This DVD pays homage in showing a documentary about the late Irish film director and his contributions to the film industry by his executor and nephew Allan Esler Smith.There is another documentary about Christmas Carol and it's endless adaptations. This DVD also features the original American and British cinema trailers. They even include silent films such as the 1922 Scrooge and the 1922 Bleak House (another of Dickens' novels).If you love the Scrooge film, you will love this wonderful DVD and will make a perfect gift for anybody this time of year.	5.0	Excellent Ebenezer & Extras!	2011-12-21	5	5	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A126KQL50VSVPE	"S. Young ""Cat Lover"""	Of ALL of the multitudes of versions of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; this has always, ALWAYS been my favorite. There is simply nothing lacking in this portrayal. The modernized versions may please some crowds but it seems to me that everyone I talk to in my own circle of friends seem to agree that this version has all of the elements of emotional extremes....One can feel the genuine terror of Scrooge during his late night visits and the horror of the future he sees, yet oddly enough there are those very special moments that &#34;peek out&#34; through his facial expressions - a softening of the eyes, a slight tear or gentle furrough of the brow...a wave of tenderness in his face as he recalls the kindness of his former employer or the love he bore for his frail and kind-hearted sister.This version of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; is unique in that it reveals the characters as I would envision the actual author of the book had intended rather than the typical Hollywood versions which always seem to overplay the characters and cheapen the characters. This version brings out the depth of character of virtually all of the characters in the film, and the actor who played Tiny Tim was a winning pick for a little tot so full of pure innocence!	5.0	Oh, What a Fine, Moving Classic!	2013-04-09	1	1	0
6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A3FDBBQ0NK2SSO	"takingadayoff ""takingadayoff"""	If the Alistair Sim version of A Christmas Carol is your favorite, then this DVD set is for you. They've cleaned up the version you've seen a million times and it looks fresh and sparkly. You'll see details you never noticed before. You'll hear dialogue you missed before. They even have a short feature demonstrating and explaining the clean-up process.In addition, there's a colorized version of the same film that looks fabulous. Colorizing has come a long way in the past few years. There's also an earlier British production of A Christmas Carol (or Scrooge, as it is titled in Britain) which runs less than an hour in its entirety. It's interesting as a curiosity only - the short length means they left out a lot of the story and if you didn't already know the story, you would be rather lost.There are lots of other extra commentaries and an interview with George Cole, who plays the young Ebenezer Scrooge to Alistair Sim's older Scrooge. You may remember George Cole as Henry Root, or as the banker in the Royal Command Performance of Good Neighbors. And Patrick Macnee does an uninspired introduction to the movie. He played a small role as young Jacob Marley in the film.So, if you love this version of A Christmas Carol, you will really appreciate this remastered edition. Personally, I prefer the later version with George C. Scott as Scrooge.	4.0	Curses, Scrooged Again	2007-10-06	3	3	0

You just feel like you've been transported back in time. But the big reason for the success of this version is the portrayal of Scrooge, played by Alastair Sim. He is as unreasonable man as there can be, but is completely transformed once visited by the four spirits. Those visits really paint a picture of how a kind, young Scrooge became such a hardened soul through loss of loved ones and loss of love, accompanied by greed. A must see for everyone, this &#34;Christmas Carol&#34; is the only version you ever need to see.	5.0	Best Christmas Movie	2014-01-18	0	0	0

Choose the original mono for sound.Second, the aspect ratios available have problems. The film was originally released in a 1.43:1 aspect ratio. The 4:3 setting is intended for 4:3 television screens and contains the picture in its original aspect ratio. (My widescreen TV does not allow a 4:3 setting for watching blu-rays). The setting for 16:9 televisions crops the picture on the top and bottom to fit the entire screen.The blu-ray also does not have the pop up menus that one can normally turn on during the film.On a positive note, the picture quality is very good, has red subtitles, and optional DVS for visually impaired.	3.0	Great film but the Blu-Ray has some flaws	2009-12-13	5	3	2

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A1ST9PG26FSN2H	Thomas Paul	"A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is the perfect Christmas story. The 1951 version of the story starring Alastair Sim as the miserly Scrooge is the perfect version of the book. And now thanks to advanced restoration technology, we have the perfect version of the movie.This has always been a Christmas favorite in our house. Every year as my wife and I help Santa put the presents under the tree, we watch the ghosts show the miserly Scrooge his past and how he has allowed the evils of the world to turn his heart, the present and how the joys of Christmas are for all people no matter how poor, and the future and how what we leave behind depends on how we lived. Alastair Sim is perfect in the role showing us that Scrooge isn't evil but rather that Scrooge hates all men, no less himself, because of the suffering and death he has endured. When Scrooge changes, and no actor does a better job of changing from ""bad Scrooge"" to ""good Scrooge"", we cheer that the good man who was always in him has been allowed to burst free.This DVD has been restored using the original masters of the film and advanced computer technology. Nearly perfect, it makes the earlier versions look muddy which we can see in the short comparison of the two provided as an extra. The extras themselves are worth the price. An audio commentary is provided by Robert Cole who played the young Scrooge in the film. Cole actually lived with Sim when Cole was an up and coming actor and has many stories to share. Richard Gordon (who provided the funding for the film) relates the interesting story of how the movie was created in the short about George Minter and Renown Pictures. The package also includes as a bonus, the colorized (but not restored) version of the movie (which I will never watch) and the 1935 movie, ""Scrooge"" starring Sir Seymour Hicks in what is a fairly good version of the book.There are a few Christmas movies that must be watched each year and this version of A Christmas Carol is absolutely one of them. And now that it is available in restored form it is even more of a must-see version. No movie version is closer to the work of Charles Dickens and no team of actors does a better job of bringing Victorian England to life on the screen. This is not to be missed.

Alastair Sim shows the true depth of emotion that Dickens intended for his most famous character.  The conversion from a bitter old miser to the kindest gentleman the old city ever saw has been lost with most other actors but Sim captures the transition materfully.  The black and white adds to the mood and the dialogue is not covered over by digital gadgets.  It is the only version of this classic tale that I have ever felt the need to expose my daughter to and it instantly became her favorite version of the story too........and she otherwise hates Dickens!

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2JP0URFHXP6DO	Tim Janson	It's quite fun to read the reviews of the different versions of this film and see how opinions view on which is the best.  My own person list of the best versions would go like this:1) Alastair Sim version2) George C. Scott version3) patrick Stewart Version4) Reginald Owen Version5) Albert Finney Musical Version6) Seymour Hicks version.Note I do not include the novelty versions such as Scrooged, Muppets, or any animated version.Each and every version has taken poetic license with the Dickens material and either added scenes or deleted scenes from the original version.  The Sim version is no different.  Scenes such as Scrooge visiting Marley on his death bed and showing in a flashback how Scrooge & Marley first came to control their company were not in Dickens' original story.  I don't have much of a problem with that as it is merely to beef up the background and doesn't change the story,On the other hand, in the Reginald Owen version, Scrooge actually fires Bob Cratchit for ruining his hat after knocking it off Scrooges head by a snowball!!!  Now THAT is a major change and one reason why I rate the Owen version so low.The Sim version benefits from a great English cast including Michael Hordern as Marley's ghost, kathleen Harrison as Mrs. Dilber, and the incomparable Ernest Thesiger as the undertaker.  If you're looking for pure Dicken's there's nothing closer to the book and more instilled with Dickens pure spirit than the scene in Old Joe's parlor as the maid, laundress, and undertaker come to sell off the goods taken from the dead Ebenezer Scrooge.But at the end of the day this version is the best because Sim was simply the best SCrooge.  He did not go over the top like Finney and Stewart, nor underplay the role like Owen did.  He comes as close to my vision of Scrooge as any actor to play the role.One note..another reviewer said Pactick Macnee (of Avengers fame) played Tiny Tim.  That was incorrect. Macnee actually played the young Jacob Marley in the scene where he and SCrooge first meet.I'll watch any version of this film because I love it but this IS the BEST!	5.0	STILL THE BEST VERSION	2004-12-14	7	5	2

This movie to me is a classic which should be watched every Christmas. The sets superbly capture the atmosphere of the time and the actors all seem to be expertly cast for their roles. Just an enjoyable film which should be in every movie buffs movie library.

Those DVDs boast crisp images, tight focus and depth. Details are delightfully visible, gray tones have a broad variation, the focus is sharp and the whites have no ghost like haloes.This copy of A Christmas Carol is one shaky, blurry scene after another, where no part of the scene seems to be in focus. Notice, for example that it is hard to see the numbers on the grandfather clock when the camera views it directly. There are scratches and frame slips that are obviously just worn film that could have been restored but wasn't. Worst of all are video lines visible whenever a white face turns quickly.Even the Patrick Macnee intro is blurry and off color, with Macnee's face redder than Rudolph's nose in the cartoon.Of the over 170 reviews of this film, only two or three suggest what they viewed was a sharp clear image. I wish I felt that way about the copy I have. Could they be watching a different version or edition?What a shame this important film isn't available in a format worthy of its original grandeur and excellent acting.	2.0	Bad Image	2006-12-18	11	9	2

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A36AS0J5HF0IP7	Virginia Opera Fan	"I admire this film for its atmospheric evocation of Victorian London, but there have always been elements in the adaptation that have struck a discordant note. First, as excellent as Sim is as Scrooge, he strikes me as too hale and hearty for Dickens' creation of frozen old features, shriveled cheek, stiffened gait, and pointed nose. Even so, the performance is a classic. For that matter, Mr. and Mrs. Cratchit don't appear to have suffered much at the table from their ""15 bob"" weekly salary.I've loved the story ever since it was read, en famille, as part of the Christmas rituals of my childhood. I have always been puzzled why the screen writer (or the producer) decided to insert the novelty of Scrooge's mother having died at his birth as the reason for his being sent away to school. The novella only tells us that he is neglected. Furthermore, Dickens describes the sister Fan as ""much younger"" than Ebenezer. I suppose this could be explained by her being a half sister, but Ebenezer contradicts that notion that their ""dear Mama"" must have looked much like Fan at the time of her death. The substitution of Alice for Belle as Scrooge's fiancee does little enough harm. Omitting the novella's scene of Belle/Alice's domestic happiness on the Christmas Eve of Marley's death, in favor of Alice's 'Christmas present' nursing in a bedlam-like hospital, fails to drive home the point of the happiness Scrooge threw away years before. Scrooge's emotions at seeing Belle's daughter and his realization that ""such another creature, quite as graceful and full of promise, might have called him father, and been a springtime in the haggard winter of his life"" is a key element in his emotional reclamation.The screenwriter tends to beat us over the head concerning Scrooge's sharp business practices. The early scene between Scrooge and the debtor Wilkins has no parallel in the novella. The scene between the young Scrooge and Marley as clerks is not Dickens, nor is the board meeting where the two partners rescue the Amalgamated Mercantile from the embezzlement of a fellow director by buying the company. The  scene between the dying Marley and Scrooge, where the former has a deathbed conversion regarding his life, is similarly an invention of the screenwriter.Kathleen Harrison's popular (at the time) cockney schtick probably accounts for the expansion of Mrs. Dilber's role from her only appearance in the novella's rag and bone shop, where she vends Scrooge's stolen bed curtains, to the messenger of Marley's approaching demise and witness of Scrooge's regeneration after the supernatural visits. Tiny Tim is given clairvoyant powers in an invented scene in which he declares the anonymous turkey a gift from Scrooge.Scrooge's penitent Christmas Day encounter with the two gentlemen collecting for charity, whom he essentially threw out of his office on Christmas Eve, is omitted. The omission damages the overall conclusion. Scrooge is newly charitable toward his employee, Cratchit. He has returned to the family fold in reconciling with his nephew, Fred. The deleted scene shows us his intent to make amends to his fellow man as a whole.As others have noted, the blu-ray disc is sharper in image than the standard DVD but shows scratches, occlusions, and audio drop outs that don't disfigure the older version.My grousing about the screenplay aside, I do think this is a classic. However, to get the full measure of Dickens' humanity, generosity, and skill as a story teller in a concentrated timespan, you have to read his novella."	4.0	Atmospheric, but not exactly faithful to the novella	2011-12-12	0	0	0

Certainly the truest and most emotionally stirring adaptation of Dickens' classic to this day, and most certainly to come. How do I know this? Well, in the words of Tiny Tim, ""I just think it"". The aged condition of the film and the fact that it was shot in black and white lend a certain authenticity to it, as if it were actually filmed in the story's time period. Alastair Sim was born to play Scrooge. Even some of the finest actors can't (and won't) ever approach the level he set. He was the ""model Scrooge"". Sim was as equally convincing as a heartless miser as he was a man enlightened, redeemed and reborn. Other fine actors could play one or the other but not both, at least, not convincingly. Sim is also supported by a very strong cast and crew. This classic version has Heart; It has Spirit like no other; It has believability; It has purpose. Just the sight of a poor little boy (Tiny Tim) peering through a toy shop window and managing a smile even though he knows he'll never have any of the toys he sees will be indelibly etched into your conscience. The music during that scene will stay with you for many seasons to come. Somebody did a commendable job restoring this treasure. Even the standard DVD (also restored and included) looks and sounds far better than any prior home video release, but it's still not perfect. Nevertheless, great strides in its restoration were made and I highly recommend it. But as far as the story goes, watch it alone the first time, without interruption, and if you find yourself touched and perhaps rubbing a tear from your eye at the end when you hear the words, ""Can you forgive a pig-headed old fool..."", ahhh, you're there.

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A19HGJQ8MG4CZ7	William H. Burke, Jr.	I just can't imagine how you could make this great movie any better, except perhaps the Ghost of Christmas Past beingplayed by Ann Rutherford (who played it in the Reginald Owen version of this movie). Alastair Sim, of course, does a superbjob playing Scrooge, he's so believable in this from the start to the finish. But the guy (Michael Hordern) who plays Marley'sghost does an unbelievable job. I think this movie has to be played by English actors, you get the real feeling of CharlesDickens' London in the 1830's. Christmas would not be complete for me without seeing this show at least once. It's rarelyon the networks on Christmas eve any more, so that's why I purchased this DVD, so I can view whether it's on TV or not.	5.0	The great movie version of the Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens	2013-01-23	2	2	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A347MRCA48RV4J	wiser consumer	I've owned a version of this movie for many years, beginning with the purchase of a VHS copy from the University of Washington in Seattle sometime in the 70s. But as I progressed to DVD versions, it wasn't until I got a colorized copy that some scenes made sense. For instance, the scene where Tiny Tim is looking through the front window of a toy shop -- there had always been toys I could make neither head nor tail of. Another was the scene where the Ghost of Christmas Past transported Scrooge into the snow covered fields of his youth. In that scene both Scrooge and the ghost were filmed to appear transparent and, so, were difficult to make out in black and white.So the colorized version was a big improvement in so far as the ability to quickly identify the objects in each scene. Has this much improved black and white version eliminated the problem? It's difficult to say since I already know what the objects are. Do I believe the artistic intent of a movie is ruined by colorizing? No, that choice may have been dictated by the money available to make the film.I have many older movies in black and white, which I have no desire to see in color. But in this case, I believe it adds to the movie -- it's not a horror film best seen in black and white only.	5.0	Excellent black and white version but the colorized is good too.	2012-01-06	0	0	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A287PZ38OLCOYI	Wm. J. Chesterfield	I've seen at least six other versions of A Christmas Carol over the years, and though I've heard many times of the classic version starring Alastair Sim and how it is the best of all, I'd never seen the film until today.  I'm sorry to say how badly disappointed I was.  It's not that the Sim version is at all a bad film, but I cannot understand how anyone could consider this to be the best version of Dickens' story.  The book differs greatly from Dickens' book and is replete with apocryphal scenes and dialogue that have no basis in the book whatsoever.  This would be fine, as all versions do this to some extent, but here I find the added material to contribute little to the story, and this is unfortunate when other parts of the original story are given such scant treatment by this film.  For instance, at least 8 minutes of this movie are dedicated to a scene (not in the book) in which Scrooge learns of Marley's imminent death and visits visits his partner on his death-bed, but the scene in which the reformed Scrooge meets the charity workers had had spurned the day before and offers them a hefty sum is not in this movie at all.  Also, the story is uneven; the Ghost of Christmas Past seems to have about twice as much screen time as the Ghosts of the Present and Future combined!  I strongly recommend the George C. Scott version of A Christmas Carol over this one.  The acting, dialog, and music of that version make it the best by far in my opinion, and it is much more faithful to Dickens' book than the Sim version.	2.0	A Sorely Disappointed Dickensian	2004-12-05	28	7	21

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A256K5OWFX1K71	Wordsmith	There are many versions of this classic Dickens tale, but none better than this one. Alistair Sim's is the definitive portrayal of Scrooge, a far more complex and three dimensional character than most of us would think. The DVD offers a nice extras package that gives the viewer much insight into how the struggles of life in post-war England helped shape this version into something a bit darker - and yet ultimately more hopeful - than any other. A total winner on all levels.	5.0	The best version by far	2013-01-26	0	0	0

6302595916	A Christmas Carol (Colorized) [VHS]	A2B8GXSCB1R05T	Zack Davisson	Somehow, across the years, the story of Ebenezer Scrooge and his three ghosts has been transformed from it's spooky roots to light-hearted family fare.  Scrooge is not so much evil, as grumpy.  The ghost's tend to amuse rather than frighten.This black-and-white version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; maintains the horror roots of the story.  Jacob Marley is one of the most frightening ghosts to haunt the silver screen.  He grows intolerant of the idea that Scrooge is not frightened, and howls his rage and frustration.  The Ghost of Christmas Past is an impersonal specter, cold and distant.  Present is jolly and yet quick to anger.  Future is the grim shade that he is supposed to be.The back story of Scrooge is told in greater detail here than in any other version.  He resents Fred, not because of his Christmas cheer but because his birth caused the death of Scrooge's beloved sister.  He not only remembers the good times at Fezzywig's, he remembers putting Fezzywig out of business later in life.  Alastair Sim brings this character to fullness more than any other actor.  The Christmas morning scene is  a delight, and worth the wait.As a bonus, the Fleischer &quot;Rudolph the Rednose Reindeer&quot; is included on this disk.  This is clearly Santa Claus by the people who gave us the first animated Superman.  The animation is fluid and dynamic.  One of the best extras on any DVD.	5.0	A haunting ghost story	2001-12-06	108	102	6
