In shock, I asked the receptionist what swearing was doing in a children's movie.  She shrugged and said, ""It's pretty mild swearing, isn't it?""  I've heard some oxymorons in my life (ex. military intelligence), but that one took the cake!If you can get past the variety of black and blue words, then there's the ""lamp"" which the boy refers to as ""electric sex.""  Again - in a children's movie?I'm just glad I never intentionally set aside time to waste on this movie.  It's a cute enough idea; I even enjoyed the ""narration"" feel of having an adult male do voice-overs of thoughts and memories as if the story is told in retrospect.  But it's not a movie I would ever want in my home, let alone have my children watch elsewhere!"	1.0	Not a children's movie	2012-12-20	18	5	13
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3HS5U2UUSQP0N	"&#34; Anti Microchip &#34; ""Jesus Christ can ..."	"The Movie ""A Christmas Story"" came out in the early 1980's and has remained a prominent Christmas classic to present time. The imagery is of Christmas in Indiana in what appears to be the 1950's or early 60's.  This is really the story of a whimsical boy (Ralphie) who will stop at no lengths to seduce his parents into buying him the Red Rider B.B. gun his boyhood passion craves.  There are many twists and turns throughout the movie; everything from the ""electric sex"" like lamp that suddenly breaks, to  a youth defining confrontation with a school yard bully. A simpler time in America History when people enjoyed Christmas, said ""Merry Christmas"", and could possibly even leave their door unlocked. This is a movie every family should watch over and over again during the Christmas season. A rare treasure by modern day standards.Merry Christmas, and God Bless you... :)"	5.0	Classic Christmas Movie!!! Must see...	2007-12-18	3	3	0
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"Jean Shepherd's 'A Christmas Story' deserves to be the classic it is.  It is a likable reminiscence of a Christmas past when the author's near self, Ralphie, yearns to get an airrifle for Christmas.  He makes every hint possible, but is always rebuffed with the counsel, ""You'll shoot your eye out.""  In the midst of his unfulfilled desire, is the usual hijinx with his school teacher and the pursuit of the neighborhood bullies.Much of the movie is episodic with fun scenes that thread loosely with the main plot.  There's the ""mouth washed out with soap"" anecdotes that are worthy as well as his father's (Darren McGavin) anxious pursuit to win prizes (like a guache stockinged leg lamp) and his fight against the faltering furnace.  Narrated by Shepherd, himself, the memoir is a fun and funny trek through holidays past.  Some of the best scenes include his inner imaginative takes on life, like his soap blindness scene and his teacher's transformation into the wicked witch of school themes.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A22AD8M2SSOFHJ	"A. C. Ege/Acedoh ""acedoh"""	"A Christmas without A Christmas Story is unheard of around these parts.  I have been watching this classic since I was a child.  From the first time on VHS to DVD and now Blu-ray.  This story is probably one of the best Christmas tales to come around the past 25 years.  So how does this HD version stack up against all the others?  Very well if you must know.For all of you familiar and unfamiliar with the story it takes place in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1940's.  An America many people seem to remember fondly.  The story centers around a boy named Ralphy and his Christmas wish to have a Red Rider BB gun.  Of course the adults all seem to feel the gun is unsafe and you the repeated phrase, ""You'll shoot your eye out.""  Although this is really just a small part of the story.Ralphy is like many boys of his age then and now.  On the cusp of adolescence while still having his childish tendencies.  During the movie you get to know his friends and all the people around him.  Every time I watch this movie I realize how much things are the same when it comes to Christmas in middle class America.  This story seems to tell it better and more realistically than most movies made.Now if you have not bought this movie on DVD it is a great value.  The picture is only mildly improved from it's DVD version.  Sometimes you will be wondering if it's really in HD.  Although despite that this is a great movie.  Christmas or not it is a classic.  The Blu-ray version comes with some extras like a anniversary follow up with a few of the child actors.  Although that is not entirely exciting the movie is."	5.0	A Christmas Classic Brought to you in Glorious HD	2007-12-25	2	1	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	"The film begins in winter, children await Christmas. The cars suggest the 1930s. Kids view a department store window. Ralphie sees the one toy he wants: a Red Ryder BB gun. People listen to ""The Lone Ranger"". Mother knows there is danger with such a toy. [Ralphie's fantasies reflect the cowboy movies of the 1930s.] Remember those snow suits? Would they act up in class? Would they stick out their tongue? What do they want for Christmas? What did his Dad win? How do the piggies eat? What an artistic lamp? They don't make them like that anymore! Remember 15 minute radio programs? Remember tires that often went flat? Getting your mouth washed out with soap? [Was 'Lava' worse than 'Lifebuoy'?] ""A crummy commercial!""Ralph's father fights with the furnace. His Mom has an accident with that lamp. Ralphie learns about peaceful coexistence in the alley. Can he ask Santa for that BB gun? We see an elaborate Christmas parade from that era. Santa Claus warns him about that BB gun. Christmas arrives, Santa left a load of toys. Aunt Clara sent a special gift for Ralphie. Isn't it cute? ""What's that behind the desk?"" Ralphie learns that a BB gun is dangerous when not properly supervised. [A metal backing ricochets towards the shooter.] An open door is dangerous when there are hungry dogs outside. Where can they find a restaurant on Christmas Day? They'll always remember that day.Jean Parker Shephard had a late-night radio show from the late 1950s to the late 1970s. He would reminisce about the days of yesteryear, as in this film. He wrote books during this era. The fact that he lost an eye in childhood was a secret. You can surmise the cause. Any gun is a danger when mishandled by an inexperienced child. BB air guns were originally designed as a toy or tool for adults or responsible children. If you remember another version you'll know they were more explicit about the damage to the eyeglasses. This film shows how commercials to children are used to control buying by adults."	5.0	Nostalgic Christmas Comedy	2009-01-30	0	0	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1U1V1JT09MAN7	ALEXANDER KENNETH KUHNS	I'm not a person who likes low-brow humor, nor am I easily amused, so this movie is one helluva an achievement: every time I see it, no matter how many times I see it, it makes me laugh.  Even having grown up in the 80s in New Jersey(rather than the 40s in Indiana), I find it easy to identify with Ralphie's obsession with the BB Gun and his mother-related dilemma (&quot;You'll shoot your eye out!&quot;).  I have noticed a disturbing trend in the reviews of people who don't like this movie, however.  Generally, they complain about the violence and the profanity.  I just have one question for these people: have you been under a rock the past twenty years?  You want violence and profanity, try Zeena and South Park, respectively (both shows marketed to kids).  In closing, Grinches, I say to you now a) Get a life and b) Ohh, Fudge.	5.0	The Christmas Story - A Classic	2000-12-25	5	5	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	ADH8OLVJKT05Z	Amazon Customer	"This movie is an annual Christmas ""Event"" in my household, second to none.  Of course other annual Christmas movie traditons in our home include the classic ""Charlie Brown Christmas"", and one dear to my heart, ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"".  However, those hold mainly nostalgic value for me -- I enjoy them immensely of course -- but none can compete with ""A Christmas Story"" for pure entertainment value!I first saw this as a pre-teen, along with my family.  It was an instant classic for us, and we watched it every year.  I of course continued this tradition into adulthood - introducing it to my husband and then my kids (the younger two don't quite get it yet, but my almost 10 year old loves it!).This movie has all the great nostalgic touches -- the perfect example of a 40's-era midwest American family, complete with many highlights of that golden age (which I admittedly only know through stories of my parents, but they are touching nonetheless).More than the touches of yester-year warmth, however, the absolute hilarity of this Christmas movie is simply unparallelled.  Several holiday movies since then have tried to match its comic value, and none have come close.I love funny movies -- but real, truly laugh-out-loud ones are as rare as a snowstorm in Texas.  This one is the real deal.If you haven't seen it, please -- run, don't walk to your nearest movie rental store and GET IT. The childhood antics and dreams of Ralphie will win your heart forever, and several lines and scenes from the movie will stay with you always.Watching it every single year since the mid-eighties has not diminished my fresh enjoyment of it one iota.""You'll shoot your eye out kid....HO!! HO!! HO!!"" (for those of you who have seen it, imagine the Santa Mall scene with the boot on the last ""HO"").

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1EQZQ5BY3TXPG	"Amazon Customer ""NoirDame.com"""	"This poignant yet non-saccachrine story is one tradition shared by at least 1/6th of all Americans, which is apparently how many tuned in to see this movie being played 24 hours a day on cable channel TNT last Christmas.It is hard to believe that, like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" this film didn't automatically hit a home run at the box office, but after twenty years, it's met the test of time, picking up new fans each generation. So many of the actors turn in understated, wry performances, including the children, who don't resort to ""the cutesys"" in order to keep audience interest high, and come off as true to life, rather than ""movie"" kids. While everyone who ever dreamt of a special toy for Christmas can relate to Ralphie, adults will love Ralphie's parents, played by Melinda Dillon and Darren McGann, and to a lesser extent, the teacher. Along with Ralphie's fun fantasies and excitement over his decoder ring, there's magic in small moments - the mother tastes Lifebuoy, the father flipping a forlorn piece of turkey, and of course, the moment when the grownups have their ""battle on Cleveland Street"".  The overall message is one of gruff love and wonder in the face of life's little disappointments.As for the two DVDs and the special features, this is one set that was made primarily for a family audience, and may disappoint more seasoned DVD viewers. One of the disc easter eggs is a tacky and unfunny advertisement for a Leg Lamp as seen in the picture - ironically, considering the Little Orphan Annie/Ovaltine decoder ring incident in this film. The commentary track is in a polite, measured tone by Peter Billingsley (Ralphie) and director Bob Clark, who delicately refers to Jean Shepherd's difficult reputation, mentioning that Steven Spielberg asked him, ""How did you deal with him?"" after meeting Shepherd. Clark also notes that he asked Shepherd to leave the set after a few weeks, but never bad-mouths him, instead reminiscing about the first time he heard Shepherd on the radio, driving to a date in Florida, and deciding at once that he would make a film of Shepherd's stories.Jean Shepherd's original radio monologues are on here, but the interface, shaped like a classic radio, is a little confusing. Using the left/right keys will switch between the two stories on the radio, but using the up key is the only way to exit; my DVD player did not allow me to redirect to the main or sub-menu.While the Double Dog Dare trivia challenge is cute, the featurette, interviewing most of the child actors and Clark, is broken up by several script pages filled with silly rhymes. One of these ""pages"" would have been enough. ""Scut Farkus"" actually steals the show here, upbeat, energetic and mock-hostile, telling the tale of a Christmas bulb he'd prefer to forget. Fortunately, ""Flick"" does not detail some of the poor choices he recently made employment-wise."	4.0	Christmas classic; special features are more fun for kids	2003-12-19	3	3	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A4F2LRIG0GIMZ	Amber Faulk	I love christmas and nothing is better than snow, presents and spending time with loved ones. But the one thing I anticipate the most is seeing the movie &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; on TV, a charming tale of a 9 year old boy named Ralphie, his wacky friends and family, and his quest for the ultimate christmas gift, a red rider bee bee gun. I first saw the movie when I was 13, in a couch bus coming back from New York City in the middle of December. It immediately stole my heart. I loved when TNT ran &quot;24 hours of A Christmas Story&quot; on Christmas Eve. Me and my younger cousins continued to watch it on Christmas days as we opened Christmas, trying to uncover the perfect present, just like Ralphie. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the holidays and who's young at heart.

My whole family was disappointed and perplexed. First, it was not funny. At all. Second, none of the characters had any redeeming qualities. You did not ""feel' for any of them. Third, the movie jerks about from vignette to vignette with little flow, rhyme or reason. It's a pile of cliches: Ralphie takes on the bully (boy that looked real) (not!), the famous tongue-on-the-flagpole scene (cliche) is dragged out for 10 minutes.....All of the  over-30-year-old figures are bad people or twisted - the visiting Santa scene was particualrly disturbing - what was the point of that scene?  The whole idea of ""let's remember Christmas through the selfish, fantasized eyes of a kid"" can work, but not here. It'a a downer, the whole film. There is nothing uplifting. There is nothing cute. There is nothing warm. There are no - zero - redeeming qualities.It is also disturbing to me that the Wireless and Signals Catalogs ( in theory from Public TV) have been flogging the ""Major Award""  (ie the plastic woman's-leg-in-fishnet-stocking-lamp) as a souvenier from this ""Christmas Classic"". Ugh!Nothing cute. Nothing funny. Nothing uplifting or even sardonic  ""this was the Christmas we learned about Chinese Turkey"" - wow - hilarious.Why am I droning on like this? Because I paid $16 for this ""christmas classic"" to be sent to me RIGHT AWAY.Do not waste your money on this film until you see it on TV or through a friend or rental.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A17V1PTBVSAXP2	A mom from North Carolina	I have to agree whole heartedly with Jamie. This is the worst Christmas Movie I have seen.  The profanity ruins it.  It's a 1940's film with 1990's movie profanity.  If you have children under the age of 10, you  need to be aware.  The father is mean.  The are two prolonged scenes where  a bully makes another boy put his tongue on a metal pole and another where  Ralphie fights with him.  And to top it off the Santa and his elves are  mean.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A393JO1BOVEZA8	Anthony R. Pecchia	If you're like me, you've been looking at &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; dvds every year and wondering, &quot;Why no features?&quot;  Well finally for the 20th anniversary our wish has come true, kind of.If you've never seen this movie before, (considering TNT plays it 24 hours straight every Xmas, I find that hard to believe) this is a true classic.  This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family, kids and adults.  We've all gone through what Ralphie goes through for that perfect present.  Plus there's a lot of heart in this movie.  Even technically though it's a period piece, in a way it's timeless.  But enough about the movie, let's talk extras, one by one.1) Widescreen and fullscreen on the same disc- I honestly don't undertstand this tactic.  If you have widescreen, why would you want the other?2) Commentary by Bob Clark and Peter Billingsley- Very nice, although I think it would have been better with the other 'kids' reminiscing as well.  You can tell everyone had fun making this film, although at the time no one knew of the future it held.  (Side note: On the package Melinda Dillon is listed for the commentary.  Incorrect, she is nowhere to be found on the extras.  Too bad)3) Radio readings ny Jean Shepherd- A nice addition, but some visuals other than a picture of a radio would have been better.4) Documentary- It's great to see some of the other 'kids' today.  Flick, Schwartz, and Scutt Farkas join Bob Clark and Peter Billingsley in talking about making this film.  But at just 17 minutes, I would hardly call it a documentary.  Since they did this featurette, why couldn't they join in the commentary?  They all have good things to say about being in the film.5) Leg Lamp and Red Ryder gun featurettes- Here's where things start to go downhill.  While the piece on the gun was interesting, the lamp was way over the top.  Yes, the leg lamp was funny, but you don't need to treat it like it's the History Channel.6) 'Interactive' Trivia- 'Interactive' is their word, not mine.  They ask you questions, you answer them, with no big payoff.7) Decoder ring- Just a simple match-the-quote-to-the-scene deal, with some corny jokes from the actors thrown in.8) Easter eggs- Just 2, real easy to find and definitely not worth the effort.  It's the kind of egg where you think: That's the best they could come up with?Don't get me wrong, I don't wish to sound all negative.  It's truly a great holiday movie.  I just think the extras could have been better.  With all the junk movies that come out loaded with tons of stuff, it's frustrating to see wonderful films like this one get either nothing or stupid stuff.  We want extras that enhance watching the film, not a bunch of flotsam just so you can call them 'extras'.	4.0	Great movie!, ok dvd.	2003-10-09	14	14	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3H3QQECWEAUPT	A. Peters	This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  One of the reasons that I like it is that it is so funny.  And it is always interesting to watch a movie or read a book that involves a child's point of view.  The whole movie is great, but my two favorite scenes are the scene with the lamp and the bunny costume.  I can understand why Ralph would not want to wear something like that.  And I hate the color Pink!  The scenes between the mother and father are priceless.  I would recommend this film to anyone.  Kids will love it, and it will bring back fun memories for the adults.	5.0	A Delightful Christmas Classic!	2012-11-27	0	0	0

It's a true American classic in every sense of the word. Young Ralphie Parker wants a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas. Everyone tells him that he'll shoot his eye out. Ralphie tries everything he can to get that gun. On Christmas, Ralphie gets his wish. The people that warned him about it were also right. The film has the most believeable family. How many parents were like this?. I know of many. Peter Billingsley gives a wonderful performance as Ralphie that is cemented in stone as a film classic.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1HEP6XJZAAXRU	Beagle	Like many others, I was disappointed by the 20th anniversary edition's lack of a true widescreen version of the movie. What we got was a matted version of the pan-and-scan. This means it takes out even more of the movie than the pan-and-scan. Ridiculous.If you care about getting the true theatrical version, wait until someone on here buys this edition and confirms whether or not the widescreen is what is promised. If it isn't, save your money and get a used copy.I'll give it three stars. Five for the movie, minus two for the potential rip-off of consumers.	3.0	Will the true widescreen please stand up?	2008-10-26	7	5	2

The infamous &quot;leg lamp&quot;. &quot;You'll put your eye out&quot;. The kid that falls in the snow and (pre-Clapper days, no doubt) can't get up. I can't help myself in spots; I laugh in spite of my firmly-held belief that this is a mindless movie that seems to fall off just before rolling the final credits, as if the writer forgot to put in an ending.But since I'm in the minority in my household (EVERYONE loves it), I'll give it four stars for the leg lamp alone.

There were lots of other items and actions that I could relate to. However my wife likes the watering method used by Melinda Dillon (mother) around the trophy.

Ralphie is a young boy whose obssession is for a Red Ryder beebee gun with a compass in the stock for christmas. However, everyone seems to oppose his wish, even though he leaves not too subtle hints. After all, he's likely to shoot his eye out!

From the Major Award to the Scott Farkas affair, these are the times of childhood the way we used to know it when we were kids, when times-- and the things kids wanted were simpler but no less sought after. Does Ralphie get his beebee gun? Will he have to wear that godawful rabbit suit that he got from his benighted aunt?

Thankfully ""Christmas Vacation"" is a PRIME members selection since we loaned out our DVD to friends and ended up downloading it as well from Amazon.  The picture quality on the downloads is generally good & audio quality is quite good as well.  As with most downloads though, occasionally the video would get pixelized & almost come to a complete stop but it would only be for a couple of seconds.

I have seen the movie so many times, mostly during the holidays, that I wonder if I will ever grow tired of it.The movie takes the viewer back to a simple time in the 40's when things didn't seem to be so quite as complicated as the modern day world.  After all, nine-year old Ralphie Parker, played by Peter Billingsley, only asks for ONE thing for Christmas.  This past Christmas I was presented with a Christmas list from one of my children that contained more than 20 items!!  Ralphie simply wants a Red Ryder BB gun and to him that is the ultimate Christmas gift.  However, he receives opposition from his teacher, mother and even jolly old Santa himself.  They all tell him the same thing . . .&quot;You'll shoot your eye out!&quot;Ralphie's adventures win my heart everytime.  His wonderful imagination in the Ovaltine decoding and the way he still appears so innocent after occassional bad words slip out while the soap goes in.The family appears to be a little dysfunctional which gives the viewer a reality perspective when compared to shows like &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot;.  Darren McGavin plays Ralphie's dad and his &quot;Tim the Tool Man&quot; escapades are all hilarious.This movie gives me a warm fuzzy feeling no matter how many times I watch it and it deserves five stars.	5.0	How Many Times Will be Too Many?	2004-04-25	2	2	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3JBURL139G1Q9	"B. Pomeroy ""bpomeroy54"""	"""A Christmas Story"" belongs right up there with ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" (choose your favorite version) in the canon of great, indispensable Christmas movies.  Though set in the 1940s, its story is timeless, taking us back to when we were kids and so desperately wanted that one special gift under the tree on Christmas morning.  The movie brilliantly captures the obsession of young Ralphie and his quest for a Red Ryder BB gun, relaying perfectly the magic and thrill of Christmas through a child's eyes.Intermingled with this are wonderful, hilarious snippets of the absurdities of everyday life, from poor Flick getting his tongue frozen to a flagpost, to the perpetually smoking coal furnace, to Ralphie getting his mouth washed out with soap for saying ""fudge"" (though we all know the word he *really* said), to the family's hapless introduction to ""Chinese turkey.""But what sets ""A Christmas Story"" apart from most other holiday movies it its honesty.  Instead of preaching to us about ""the true meaning of Christmas"" or making us feel guilty about commercialism, the movie acknowledges what we all know but are often afraid to say -- it's all about the toys!This is one of those rare movies that I can watch again and again.  In fact, Christmas isn't complete without at least one viewing.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3MQQS40FK2QAQ	"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle"""	"There is a moment in A CHRISTMAS STORY that you don't hear much about in movie reviews, but it's one of the many scenes that demonstrate how funny the film really is. Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) had just uttered the ""F--- word"". Mother (Melinda Dillon) literally does the one thing every mother threatens to do when a child uses such language. Now, she demands to know where Ralphie heard that word. We hear Ralphie's narration explain where he heard it. My own father completely came apart with laughter at that explanation. I had never heard the man laugh so hard in my life. I laughed out loud, too. And every time I see the movie it always gets a laugh out of me and my friends.That's one of the laughs to come out of A CHRISTMAS STORY. For my father, it reminded him of the time when he was just 9 years old. He grew up in Southern California in the 1940's and recognized a lot of the elements depicted in the movie. He owned a Daisy Red Rider air rifle. And yes, his mother uttered the phrase, ""you'll shoot your eye out"". Ralphie and his brother Randy (Ian Patrilla), listen to ""Little Orphan Annie"" on the radio, sponsored by Ovaltine. Ralphie orders and receives a decoder pin. And my father told me all of that was true for him at that time. If I remember correctly, he said the teacher in A CHRISTMAS STORY dressed exactly like his grade-school teachers did. Attention to detail was clearly paid in making this movie.There are other really funny scenes in A CHRISTMAS STORY. The Old Man (Darren McGavin) wins a contest and it's a lamp in the shape of a leg. He puts it right in the front window. Mother tries to be polite. This is all the setup. The payoff is in what happens to the lamp: she accidentally breaks it, and confesses her actual opinion on that lamp. When the old man tries to put it back together, watch her in the background. Another great scene is what happens when Ralphie tries to plead with Santa after his mother and teacher told him the same thing. This is one really terrifying Santa Clause, and what he does to Ralphie is funny and not surprising. And finally, there are the fantasies Ralphie has about defending the family home, getting special recognition after his teacher reads his theme, and what would happen if he was struck blind.A CHRISTMAS STORY got very good reviews in the winter of 1983, and did okay at the box office. After it came out on video it became a big sensation. Then, TNT began doing A CHRISTMAS STORY marathons every Christmas Eve. Like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and A CHRISTMAS CAROL, it has become an annual ritual for families to watch every year. It deserves to be called an American classic today. Peter Billingsley is now in his forties and a highly regarded film producer (he has worked with Vince Vaughn and Jon Favrau for the past ten years.) And yet, nearly thirty years after A CHRISTMAS STORY came out, people talk to him about it. Before he did this movie I knew him as ""Messy Marvin"" in the Hershey chocolate syrup commercials. They were really funny. He didn't really act in anything memorable afterwards, but he demonstrated acting talent in this movie."	5.0	One of the funniest films I've ever seen	2012-01-15	2	2	0
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2SJXL2GTQ2PKV	Brad	This is not only the best Christmas movie ever, it's one of the best movies ever! How can anyone hate this movie? Who hasn't spent countless hours trying devise a plan to get the one present you want? Who's mother wasn't always worried about you putting your eye out? Who hasn't heard their father curse a blue streak while fixing a car or something that doesn't want to be fixed? Who hasn't been filled with dread by the neighborhood bully, secretly wishing to beat him to a bloody pulp? Who hasn't seen a kid have to test out the 'tongue on a fronzen pole' theory? This movie has it all. Every time I watch this movie ( too many times to count ) I'm 8 years old again. What other movie can completely take you into the movie like this one?

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2CZPM110DW516	"Brian W. Fairbanks ""Brian W. Fairbanks"""	"Post holiday depression, the syndrome in which we overdose on Christmas cheer only to feel deflated when the tinsel is taken down and the tree is tossed to the curb, was considerably lessened for Cleveland, Ohio residents following yuletide 1982. Santa may have returned to the North Pole, but in the heart of the city, Christmas was extended as Hollywood came to town to make a modestly budgeted comedy titled ""A Christmas Story.""As exciting as it was to have a movie made in one's own backyard, there was little to suggest this film would attract much attention beyond the city limits. The film's biggest star, Darren McGavin, was a superb actor but not a box-office name.  His star shone brightest on television where he memorably played the hard-boiled private investigator of NBC's 1968-69 series ""The Outsider"" and ghoul hunting newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak of ABC's ""The Night Stalker"" (1974-75). The director, Bob Clark, won admirers for his 1975 holiday themed thriller ""Black Christmas,"" but probably lost most of them after he directed ""Porky's,"" the teenage sex comedy that was a big hit with youthful audiences but widely reviled by almost everyone else.Perhaps because it so superbly applied a modern sensibility to the innocence associated with an earlier era, ""A Christmas Story"" transcended its generic title and its distributor's indifference to become a modern classic following its release to television and home video.  Based on the wryly autobiographical work of humorist Jean Shepherd, ""A Christmas Story"" is set in the radio days of the Forties before television dulled our imaginations. Young Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) hears a commercial for a Red Ryder BB gun and becomes obsessed with receiving one for Christmas.  But whenever he expresses his wish to his mother, father, teacher, playmates, even Santa Claus, he hears the same dream crushing pronouncement: ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid.""""A Christmas Story"" succeeds because it's sweet but never cloying.  It's grounded in reality yet avoids the cynicism that film-makers usually favor when attempting to avoid sentimentality.  Despite scenes reminiscent of one of Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post covers, the film never idealizes childhood or Christmas, and yet it positively glows with nostalgia.  The cast, especially McGavin, is superb, and so is the direction.  This film just may have benefitted from Clark's work on ""Porky's.""  If the characters in that sleazy teen comedy were thoroughly despicable, they may have at least helped Clark reign in Billingsley who may have otherwise overdone the cute aspects of his character.  Instead, the pint-sized protagonist is wholly believable. There hasn't been a Christmas film of this quality since the 1951 Alastair Sim version of ""Scrooge,"" and ""A Christmas Story"" can stand alongside the very best of them."	5.0	Sweet but never cloying Christmas classic	2003-12-20	1	1	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"Adapted from humorist Jean Shepherd's hilarious memoir (In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash), A Christmas Story has climbed the ranks of the annual holiday must see films to claim its spot among the hallowed elite. If you've ever tried to lick a frozen telephone pole, or found yourself in a ridiculous outfit on Christmas morning, then A Christmas Story is one comedy that you won't want to miss...The story focuses on one central character - 5th grader Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his all-encompassing quest to receive a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle for Christmas (you could put an eye out with one of those things, you know?) Thwarting Ralphie at every turn are his mother (Melinda Dillon) and father (Darren McGavin) who seem absolutely oblivious to their young child's aims.Unable to come right out and say what he wants, Ralphie drops subtle hints around the house (such as placing clipped-out magazine ads for the gun in his parents' nightstand reading material). When prodded for his true Christmas wish, Ralphie blurts out that he wants a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB gun, but his mother's only reply is, ""You don't want one of those. You'll shoot your eye out!""A Christmas Story is filled with memorable scenes and highlights that have helped built a cult following around the life of a young boy obsessed with Christmas and surrounding by eccentric family members. When Ralphie's father beams with pride at his ability to win a newspaper contest, his proudly displays his prize in the front window of the family home - his prize being a lamp with a woman's long, stocking-covering leg as its own leg to stand on. Embarrassed, Ralphie's mother ""accidentally"" breaks it, sparking a war of words with her husband. Meanwhile, Ralphie dreams of saving the whole family with his Red-Ryder BB gun, and thus earning their undying gratitude.One of the best sequences in the film involves a family trip to the local department store, where Ralphie and his little brother Randy meet with the store Santa Clause near closing time. Following a long, extended wait to reach the front of the line to see Santa, Ralphie is so brimming with anticipation to tell Santa what he wants that he can't speak. So, Santa convinces Ralphie that he wants a football. But before Santa's helper can push Ralphie down the North Pole slide, Ralphie blurts out his true wish, only to hear Santa's reply, ""You'll shoot your eye out with that, kid!""One of the best Christmas comedies ever made (few come close to Christmas Vacation), A Christmas Story is a memorable holiday classic that the whole family can enjoy. In much the same way as It's A Wonderful Life, the film has only grown in popularity in the years since its release. The timeless nature of its subject matter lends itself well to annual holiday viewing, and it remains one of the few ""must see"" films of the season...The DVD Report"	4.0	A true holiday classic...	2005-04-19	3	3	0

Where the film endeavors to elicit humor--such as in the final Chinese restaurant scene--I find myself shaking my head, considering and reconsidering precisely whence I'm supposed to derive the giggles.

If you watch it at Christmas it will seem all the more appropriate. Kids of all ages like it. Guys probably may be more empathetic since after all most of us had a Christmas or birthday were we wanted a BB gun. It is a early 1940s period piece that will appeal very strongly to those that grew up in the 40s or 50s. The author reflects back on the Christmas he wanted an Official Red Ryder BB gun.Scenes of his family life are likely to make us cry with laughter because they strike a cord of truth of our own life experiences. Ever seen a kid get his tongue stuck on a cold object? You or friend beat up by a bully? Father cursing a flaky piece of equipment? Pets eat your Christmas dinner? Someone won a goofy prize but they displayed it like a special award from the President? You get the idea. The DVD is a good transfer and includes trailer, languages, et cetera.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2E3F04ZK7FG66	calvinnme	"This odd little film has become the parallel-universe ""It's A Wonderful Life"" of our time. It brings up memories that many people can identify with - wanting - with all your heart - a toy that will ""shoot your eye out"", facing up to the school bully and then getting punished for being violent rather than being commended for courage, and for those of you up north, sticking your tongue on a frozen pole and getting stuck to it. This actually happened to my brother-in-law as a kid.However, Ralphie, the protagonist in our film, has a completely dysfunctional family. To be specific, he has a completely dysfunctional father. In the narration Ralphie never even calls him ""dad"" - he's just ""the old man"". ""The old man"" cares about nothing more than he cares for the tackiest of lamps that he received as an award that is made out of a mannequin's leg that he displays in a position of prominence in the living room. Ralphie's father is no George Bailey. If he got to see the world as it was if he never existed, no doubt the only noticeable difference would be that the tacky lamp would belong to someone else and Ralphie and his mother would be better off. The narration is wonderful as you see everything from a child's perspective, and if you remember your childhood at all, you can probably remember reasoning things out as Ralphie does. In Ralphie's world adults - including his parents - are the arbitrary givers of reward and punishment who all seem to be in odd and unreasoned alignment. These adults are mazes to be solved, not givers of lessons to be learned. However, as an adult, you'll see the humor in the situations too.

The movie itself is a classic in the US (though not so in Australia where I live) and will have you laughing all the way through.The Additional Features are pretty good - there's a 20th Anniversary doco with most of the boys (no Randy!) and Bob Clark that's quite good. The trivia is great (a little too easy for die hard fans) but the doco on a company that makes leg lamps is a little disappointing. All in all its a great addition to an awesome film!	5.0	What a Classic!!	2006-01-29	2	2	0

I've seen it at least 10 times within the last two months on DVD, and I'll probably see it again another 20 on TBS today. The movie itself is pretty humorous. It reminds me of when I was a child in elementary and how fun that day was. The acting was so phenomonal to me, because all the parts were played well. My favorite part was when the Ralphie says in a very fast pace that he wasnts a Red Rider BB Gun to the Macy's mall santa, only to get the common response ""You'll shoot your eye out kid..."". Then he kicks Ralphie down the slide. This DVD is very fun to watch. This movie came out in 1983, and it's actually older tha I am. It includes a trailer, comentary, and interviews with the characters. Like I said before, I've seen it many times, and it never gets old at all.

And I've loved it each time. With a wonderful somewhat laconic voiceover narrative by author Jean Shepherd (upon whose stories the movie is based) and terrific performances by Darren McGavin, young Peter Billingsley and Melinda Dillon, this is an immensely funny and even touching movie--with well-realized, wildly imaginative scenes (school bullies, getting a kid to eat, the father's love for an outrageously ugly leg-lamp won in a contest). There is something in which to take new delight with every viewing. Instead of the usual sappy, saccharine stuff that gets aired during the Christmas season, here's a movie with zest and bite. This is a film that uses its source material wonderfully well and succeeds in every way. Celebrate the season with glee and take in A Christmas Story.My highest recommendation.	5.0	Delightful!	2002-12-03	7	7	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2FS38D943KX12	chefdevergue	"I would generally rather have my teeth pulled than sit through the generally loathsome Christmas movie fare that is available these days.  Only a few movies are exceptions to this, and ""A Christmas Story"" is near the top of that list.It doesn't matter that the story is set in late 1945 --- if you remember your own childhood (or have kids in the right age) you will be able to relate to the trials & tribulations of Ralphie and his peers.  This movie is remarkably free of sappy nostalgia --- thank fortune --- and instead focuses on the ordeals of childhood with all of Shepard's mordant wit wonderfully intact.  The narrative & dialogue is exquisite and always has me laughing, even after repeated viewings.From a historical perspective, I enjoy the fact that this is one of very very few films available today that deals with post-war 1940's USA.  I cannot think of many films (""Best Years of Our Lives"" --- any others?) that cover that particular time period, which seems to have disappeared from our collective memory for some reason.Really, this is as good as it gets; a reminiscence of childhood without sentiment or nostalgia, and gobs of humor.

Every thing fit together so well: The kid trying to convince his parents he needed the Red Ryder rifle to defend them against the bad guys, the bursting with pride father (Darren McGavin in his best role) over luckily (?) winning the table lamp he put in the window so the neighbors could see, the quiet mother who was so ashamed to have anyone see the lamp and who accidentally - of course - broke the lamp, the younger brother who had to take the double dare to touch the frozen light pole with his tongue.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AVSHGTFRZB37L	C. Murphy	Let's face it.  99% of the people who have seen this movie never saw it in theater.  Their first experience, like mine, was either on video or a TV broadcast just before Christmas.Perhaps whoever put out this DVD wanted some quick money, and therefore avoided the widescreen format.  As for me, I love the fullscreen effect since it adds to the nostalgia of the film.  It reminds me of seeing the movie as a kid for the first time on TV at Christmas time.As for the film itself, this movie is quite easily the best Christmas movie ever made.  The comments that it portrays a dysfuncitional family couldn't be farther from the truth.  Besides telling a funny story, this movie portrays not only how most families are, but how they should be.We have two young brothers who constantly fight the way brothers do, but never in a way to say they hate each other.We have a mother constantly making sure her kids are safe and happy.  Note the scenes where she brings Randy milk when he's crying, or how she diverts attention away from Ralphie after &quot;the fight.&quot;As a couple, the parents argue the same way all parents do.  How would your wife react to a giant leg-shaped lamp?!  Sure they argue at times, but aside from sharing every meal together as a family, we see Ralphie's parents at the end of the movie holding each other by Christmas tree light, watching the snow fall at night.Then there's Ralphie's Dad.  Sure he &quot;works in profanity the way other artists work in oil...,&quot; but no one can deny the love he shows Ralphie Christmas morning.  Throughout the movie Raphie tries to sell his mother into buying him a BB gun only to find out it was his Father who knew all along.  When the Father is watching his overjoyed child unwrap and prepare his new treasure, I still smile everytime.  In fact, the only travesty about this movie is that the Father didn't receive an Academy Award for Best Actor in this scene.Overall this movie couldn't be better.  In a world filled with politically correct super fuzzy Christmas movies, it's great to sit down and watch a classic Christmas movie.	5.0	Who cares about widescreen?!	2003-04-28	4	3	1

I've seen the movie probably a half dozen times before I found out that my parents had never seen the movie before. I bought it on DVD  several years ago and made them watch it.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A23UB49EG29MVT	Commenter77	I had heard about this movie years ago and always dismissed it.  I mean, a kid wanting a BB gun for Christmas?  I just credited the enthusiasts as having very different tastes in Christmas movies.  But, thought I'd  check it out on TCM one year and was truly amazed.  One does need a break from the sentimental and musical ones now and again.As soon as I saw Ralphie's imaginary scene with Mom and Dad and little Randy huddled under the kitchen table, while he, dressed to the cowboy nines, ran off the ruffians, I was hooked.  It's just one funny scene after another, with hilarious sides running through, like Dad and the Bumpus dogs and his bouts with the furnace.  Ah, Mom was a good one, covering for the guys, but strict when it counts!  Yes.  Get the soap!  Of course, she really missed it on old Aunt so-and-so's Christmas gift - big time there.  Dad could be a bit scatty, but boy, did he come through.  And it was the best-wrapped gift, no doubt store done.  A class act there.  But the all-in-all for me was the absolutely side-splitting visit to that unbelievably grinched Santa, not to mention his imps - I mean, elves.  His Ho-Ho-Ho drew convulsive heaves, near tears, along with Ralphie's dazed expression, ending with a boot in the face down the slide.  Oh my gosh - hysterical.  And with all of that, it recalls oh-so-true-to-life common events and has a touching side as well.  Loaded with ho-ho's with absolutely NO ho-hums.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A39LRLKACX89IP	Courtland J. Carpenter	A Christmas Story is a neo-classic tale, of a young boys quest for a Red Rider BB-gun, that truly rings in the holiday spirit. For me it almost happened the same way, except the gun was a toy called the &quot;Johnny Seven&quot;, that boasted bullets, grenades, and missile launchers.  Seen through the eyes of Ralphy, the Christmas story details perfectly, a kids eye view of what it is to fantasize, and lobby your parents for your favorite Christmas present.What was so amazing about the movie was how so many of those things happened to my family during one Christmas or another.  Even the ruined dinner, causing them to go to the Chinese restaurant happened. Not by invading dogs, but by an overcooked bird. I think back then, Chinese restaurants were about the only places open on Christmas.Ralphie's adventures at school were typical as well, bullies, toadies, and the faceless mass of victims, were the order of the time. I used to get hit by bullies on the way home with these wooden rulers most school kids carried.  My dad gave me a heavy brass one, that helped me win a few battles, but I was forbidden to take it to school later. You see it fell off my desk a few times, startled the teacher, and most of my classmates.Seeing Santa at the large department store, was always a big deal.  We once waited for hours at the new outdoor mall for a Santa, who was to come in by helicopter.  In the end, he didn't come, and the merchants tried to console us with discount coupons.  The times I made it onto to Santa's lap, I was always convinced I'd get whatever I asked for, even though it didn't always turn out that way.The rest of the family in this movie was just as genuine; every dad has his quirks, and his talents.  Every mom her ways of working the system to come out in her favor, at least most of the time. Behind the scenes, parents do some amazing things on Christmas. While I thought it was Santa at the time, it still amazes me to this day, how my dad built that fancy Lincoln Log Cabin. I was never able to come even close to duplicating it, once I took it apart.One of the main things that keep this movie genuine, is that it's an ordinary family, and a personal Christmas.  Not everyone goes to bother the relatives during the holidays, at least not for an extended visit.  We have a normal, intimate, family ceremony of opening the gifts, and then enjoying the presents.  Like the classic gift scene in this movie, my dad had hidden from sight my &quot;Johnny Seven&quot;, ultimate toy weapon, and only after I had looked disappointed enough, told me where to look. When this movie played for the first time in the 80's, those great times as a kid, all came back to me with some degree of fondness.As for this particular DVD incarnation.  I love it when they give you both the Wide screen, and Full screen versions.  In the not so distant future we may all be getting HDTV screens, with wide, motion picture, aspect ratio's. Some of the full screen only DVDs I have today, may end up with black bars on sides, (on the new wider TVs) due to how they are produced. If I have a choice, I buy the wide screen, and live with the letterbox.  Its great when the producer gives you both, without charging you like your buying two movies.	5.0	Christmas Classic that brings back your childhood experience	2003-12-10	1	0	1

Bad picture quality, very few extras, and, of course, the biggest rip-off of all, it's in full-screen instead of wide-screen.  Wasn't widescreen one of the main selling points for the DVD format?  Of course it was! This particular DVD was only put out to cash in on the popularity of the movie without taking the time, care, and money to take full advantage of the format. Why buy this on DVD when you can get the same type of picture aspect-ratio and picture quality on tape? It'd definitely be cheaper!!	2.0	Yet another DVD rip-off.	2002-12-17	7	5	2

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1KYGSKDT6DKSV	C. Salaun	Now I have to stick up for Jamie a bit.  She was honest that she did not like the movie but her family did, and she said you love it or hate it.  I love it.My main problem is these parents writing reviews because it has &quot;violence and profanity&quot;.  First of all, they were looking for offensive material in this movie; no cussing of any kind was in this movie except for the one time Ralphie says the &quot;F&quot; word, which is extended by him into the word fudge in front of his father.  You actually cannot even hear the complete word.  The idea is you know what he said and his mother (which I'm sure some of the mothers with their reviews felt was also wrong) promptly washes out his mouth with soap.  Also, with the mother who felt that this is a bad movie with the gun violence these days, the movie was made in 1983 and guns don't kill people, people kill people.  You can smother someone with a pillow and it doesn't mean it's the pillow's fault.To everyone this is a very cute movie that will make a good portion of you laugh and smile.  Obviously from the other comments the DVD quality is poor but the VHS is just fine.  Not everyone will like this movie, but I hope you do not look at it to raise your children.  That is your job alone to teach your children cussing is bad, guns are not toys, and fighting is wrong, but sometimes you don't have a choice.  That is what this movie was stating.  Ralphie got in a fight because he really had no other choice so he fought to win.  His father yells in the movie and you are to take it as cussing, but you can never understand what he says.  The Santa and the elves seem mean because that is how Ralphie pictures them, as big, mean, scary people.  You have to admit they tend to scare children in real life.  Some parents just need to grow up and realize it's not everyone else's job to raise their children.	5.0	Some parents need to grow up.	2000-11-23	3	2	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A28WJUJF6D2ULA	Dai-keag-ity	A Christmas Story is the sort of movie you'll love to see again and again. It's not just funny, it's also the sort of quaint re-visitation into America's sentimental past that is a delight. Centering on one boy's Christmas, circa 1947 in small-town Indiana, and his great wish that he receive a Red Ryder BB gun (with which he is solemnly cautioned he will shoot his eye out) there isn't a boring stretch in the entire run-time. There are also too many great scenes in A Christmas Story to begin to list here, and besides, I suspect anyone who reads this review has probably seen the film enough times to know them all by heart.

That kid and everyone around him: his parents, his teachers, the kids at his school, all interact together in a dysfunctional circus that would make a great Jerry Springer show if it were more exciting.  There are a few highlights, both in humor and in drama, but they're not enough to overcome the general tone of whiny obsessiveness on the part of the characters.	3.0	Ugh, what a depressing movie.	2002-12-11	22	4	18

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1V0I04ZW7RLPY	Dandy II	A Christmas Story is about a young boy named Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his dream of owning a Red Rider BB gun.  Ralphie decides to ask for his dream prize for Christmas only to hear his mother, teacher, and even Santa Claus give him the typical adult response, &quot;you'll shoot your eye out&quot;.  The movie focuses on Ralpie's life and his endless scemes to win his coveted prize.  The setting takes place in the early 1940s in a middle class, midwestern small town.  The movie does a wonderful job of telling the story from a child's point of view all the way down to his daydreaming and scemes.  The subplots like the &quot;Scott Fargus Affair&quot;, and the &quot;major award&quot; that Ralpie's father (Darren McGavin) wins in a silly crossword puzzle contest only add to the humor and charm of this holiday classic.  Melinda Dillon plays Ralpie's stay-at-home mother, and Ian Petrella plays Ralphie's irritating baby brother.If you are looking for a funny and charming trip down memory lane then this movie is a  must see.  It will take you back to the innocence of your childhood when you and all of your friends still believed in Santa Claus and the true magic of Christmas.  This movie was written primarily for adult viewers because of the nostalgic feel, but can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  For the past several years, the TNT network has run this movie 24 hours nonstop on Christmas eve and Christmas day.  However, I would strongly suggest buying it and putting right next to the other Christmas classics in your collection.	5.0	&quot;A charming Christmas classic that will warm your heart&quot;	2003-08-29	1	0	1

And couldn't the producers come up with any extra features?  The DVD itself gets 3 stars, but the movie deserves 5.These gripes notwithstanding, this movie is a modern-day Christmas classic.  It captures the joy and fear and exhilaration and disillusionment of what it was like growing up in an America of a by-gone era.  The late Jean Shepherd is from my parents' generation, but I can still relate completely to Ralphie, Randy and all their friends  -- bullies at school --  Not getting what you really want for Christmas -- having your mouth washed out with soap and fantasizing about the day when they'd all be sorry...  It's all there!Darren McGavin is great as the blustery but sentimental dad and Melinda Dillon as the mom who is wiser than her kids give her credit for.  The movie is touching and hilarious at the same time.  It's so hard being a kid sometimes!This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and still laugh.	5.0	This modern Christmas classic deserves better treatment	2002-12-16	32	30	2

Ralphie is a boy whose hoping for the ultimate gift-a red ryder bb gun.  The whole month he tries to  persuade his parents to get it for him, while at the same time dealing with  his annoying little brother, avoiding the town bully, and constantly  dreaming of owning the red ryder.  Though this movie has little swearing,  the storyline and screenplay, along with the outrageous humoor make this a  very good movie.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2Q4HOS712BBK	Dave	Listen up people  I am from HESSVILLE (HAMMOND) Indiana which is the same place where A Christmas Story takes place.its in the northwest part of indiana about 20 minutes from chicago and right next to Gary.  now i wasnt around in the forties but i do know the area very well since i have lived here all of my life.  and the way the movie is set up, its exactly the same then, than it is now.even the telephone pole where Flick gets his tounge stuck to is in the exact same spot as it is in the movie and you can even see 165th street when the fire department is getting his tongue off.  the school Warren G Harding Elementary is the same, same name, same exact red building.  But there are 2 things That I dont like about the movie and being from the same town in where this movie took place in, i feel that my opinion is valed, so if your not from around here then there are a few things that you should know and next time you watch this movie, keep them in mind.  First, in the movie the narrator calls the town HOHMAN, Indiana, there is no such place as Hohman its really called Hammond,Indiana, Hohman is the the name of the main street in downtown Hammond and Its called Hohman Avenue, now i dont know why Jean Shepard did this And if he wanted to be really specific he would have called the town HESSVILLE which is the part of Hammond this story really takes place in. So the City is Hammond but Hessville is the part of Hammond where this movie is supposed to take place.  Now in the movie Ralphie grew up on the LEFT side of Cleveland Street but in all actuallity he lived on the RIGHT side of Cleveland Street further down by (now known as FLICKS TAP which is a bar on Kennedy Ave. that FLICK himself built) see the movie is about Jean Shepard when he was a little kid but he gave some of the characters different names, and changed te name of the city, except for Flick and a few of his other friends, those are real people.  now i thought the movie was great and everything else was perfect i think that jean shepard was a brilliant man (thats why we just built this recreation center and named it after him) I just wish he would have did the littles things that would, for me, make the movie even better. so IF YOUR ever in the area you should stop by theres alot of history here.  thanks for your time	5.0	THIS MOVIE TAKES PLACE WHERE I LIVE	2003-04-08	5	3	2

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3TA10P5W5YOQ0	David B. Jones	"Hey all!  This 1983 film, which takes place in the 1940's, is great!  It is about a kid named Ralphie who wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas, but he is told by his parents, his teacher (whom he does a paper about what he wants for Christmas), and a department store Santa, who KICKS him in the face and knocks him down a slide, ""You'll shoot your eye out!""!  This movie is also narrated by Jean Shepherd(who wrote a novel which the movie is based on, titled ""In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash), who also does the voice of Ralphie as an old man.  This hilarious movie is a GREAT Christmas classic, and is fun for all ages.  Unfortunately, the DVD isn't so great.  The picture is grainy and looks old, it isn't avaliable in widescreen, and the only special feature is the theatrical trailer.  This does not ruin this great classic, but unless you are interested in adding to your DVD collection, you should save a few dollars and get the VHS.  Thank you for your time, and Merry Christmas!"	5.0	A Great Christmas Classic	2002-07-31	23	18	5
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	"This is the story of a particular Christmas in the 1940s when little Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wanted a genuine Red Ryder BB gun and was terrified that no one would get one for him.  This film has become a beloved holiday classic, but somehow I seem to be immune to its charms.  It's not a bad movie, but it seems more like a better-than-average TV movie than a Christmas perennial that actually won two Genies (Canadians Oscars) for direction and screenplay.  However, I'll grant that the scene with the department store Santa is a classic.I guess I have to put this on the same list as ""Vertigo,"" ""E.T.,"" and ""Blow Up""--movies beloved by so many that just don't do it for me./"	3.0	"Holiday cheer from the director of ""Porky's"""	2004-12-29	11	1	10
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AHIK7BUXFRMT8	David Bower	"For some reason unknown we had never seen this movie before last night. Well last night we watched it and were totally drawn into its charm. In 1940 I was about the same age as the hero of our story and shared the same longings for a Red Ryder BB Gun. It would be difficult to exaggerate the significance that BB gun had in the life of a boy of that age at that time in history.The movie does a grand job of picturing the life of a boy in that era; the radio programs, the special rings, decoders and other secret devices that were available for the boy who wanted to be a part of something special and most of all the prized BB gun. These things made life worth living for the boy of that time. The serious turn that life would take on December 7th of the next year was still future and unknown; life at this time was good.In the evenings the family would gather around the radio and listen to favorite shows; there were a number of mystery shows that would come on in the evenings and we would always turn off all of the lights in the house and the glow of the dial on the Philco radio would be the only light. Some of the feelings of this mood are caught in the movie.The movie faithfully captures pictures of products that were popular during that time in the kitchen and laundry. The major children's movies of the time, ""Snow White"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" are portrayed in the Christmas parade scene. Both of these movies were major accomplishments that still have a huge following today.The movie does a good job of placing the viewer in the mind of the young boy in 1940 with his dreams and fantasies about what might be awaiting him in life. This movie is a fairly authentic trip down memory lane for those of us who lived our lives at that time and a glimpse of life from a boy's perspective in 1940 for those who were to be born later.I recommend the movie highly for the entire family; we're adding it to our annual Christmas collection along with other Christmas classics.PS For the record I got my Red Ryder BB gun but can't remember for sure if I slept with it."	5.0	A Charming and Delightful Story of Christmas in 1940	2011-12-11	5	4	1
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1YCDZ4K4G0CN3	David Carlin	I think people are just associating with their 80's era childhood while watching this movie.  I think the movie was just average.I just watched this for the 1st time because there was so many comments that this was a holiday classic.  I grew up in the 80's and missed it entirely.  The movie was just ok for me.  A few comical moments, but I don't think I would watch it again.For genuine Christmas Video Movie Classics, I recommend the Alastair Sim version of Scrooge done in the 1950's & A Wonderful Life	2.0	Average Holiday Movie	2007-12-22	15	0	15

His overprotective mom (Dillon), his foul mouthed father (McGavin), and many adults will say the same warning &#34;you will shoot your eye out&#34; to him. Ralphie had many hilarious situations to get his wish granted.

Others have expressed the same joy I get from this movie every year. What bugs me is the FACT this is NOT the true aspect ratio. As others have noted the double-disc WIDSCREEN version is cropped pan & scan version of the movie. Case in point, near the begining of the movie when the kids are at &quot;Higbee's&quot; you can see the so-called widscreen edition is cropped from the pan & scan. If you have this edition, compare the sides with the red and black hats on the store displays and the tops of the heads on the cutomers looking in. Shame on &quot;Warner Brothers&quot; for doing this diservice to their customers and having the AUDACITY to put on the package that the widescreen edition &quot;preserves the theatrical aspect ratio of it's original theatrical exhibition&quot; -- BUNK!. Thank God I still have my laserdisc in the proper aspect ratio. If you are a true cinefile, DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION! Save your $$$ and watch it on TNT or TBS!

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3GQKB1KF0CRPE	"Deborah MacGillivray ""Author,"""	The best Christmas tale ever - evident by Ted Turner running it for 24 hours straight the last two Christmases.But don't let that stop you.  To see the real story of the Christmas story you need to see this on DVD and all its Red Rider Beebee gun glory.The cast is superb, the tale one all babyboomers will feel is a lot like their childhood.  It is fond remembrances, without the overly cutsie pie touches.  The kids are real, the emotions are real and funny and the late Jean Sheppard's wit ( and narration) shine in this perfect tale of a boy and his desire for a Red Rider Beebee gun and the lengths he will go to to 'help' Santa remember.I love books, and often when one is made into a movie, I prefer the book.  To Kill a Mockingbird is one that I loved in both book form and movie form, and this is the other.  Based on several of Sheppard's books, this is a true gem.Every family should have this.	5.0	Only the Grinch would not love this movie!!	2002-04-05	8	7	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	"""A Christmas Story"" is one of those classics that you feel, needs to be watched every Holiday season.  I can remember watching this film a jillion times as a child and now having the opportunity to share the film with my kids.Despite being a low-budget film at that time, what made this film become a classic is that, it's a Christmas story of an American family in the 1940's.  Ralphie is a child who listens to Orphan Annie on the radio, reads comic books and wants a Red Ryder Air Gun for Christmas.But of course, how can he convince his parents to buy him one when his mother thinks he'll shoot his eye out.  So, you get to see how Ralphie tries to get the gun by trying to get a good grade on his school report, to planting an ad in his mother's favorite magazine and even going to the mall and talking to Santa.But the magical part of this film are its characters.  Every character from Ralphie's family to his friends, everything comes together quite well.  From his father who wins an award which is a leg (in fishnet stockings) lamp, his friends being bullied by Scotty Farkus, his brother who is overly dressed in his snowsuit, his friend sticking his tongue on a pole to see if it would get stuck and much more.So, back in 2003, this film received a 20th Anniversary DVD treatment and in 2006, was followed up by its first Blu-ray release.  Then sure enough, with the 25th Anniversary Ultimate Edition which had a special bundled edition in which people could own a miniature version of the leg lamp (ala string leg lamp lights for the Christmas tree) and the film on Blu-ray or get a version without the lamps.There is no difference with the 2008 Blu-ray version versus the 2006 version.VIDEO:The video is featured in 1080p High Definition/169, 1:85:1.  The Blu-ray is marginally better than the DVD version.  But you can notice the quality of it's clearness via Blu-ray.  You'll have parts on the film which look soft and nicks and scratches from the film.  But I compared my old VHS version to the Blu-ray and oh my, the Blu-ray is light years ahead of it in quality.  For an older film, having been remastered already, I don't really think we are going to get anything better than what we have on Blu-ray.  But it still looks good.AUDIO:The audio is Dolby Digital 1.0 in English and French.  I doubt we will see a TrueHD for this and since it's mostly dialogue and because of its time setting and how old this film is, I suppose I'm not too bothered by this.  It's one of those films that I'm not begging for surround sound.  So, I'm actually OK with it being 1.0.SPECIAL FEATURES:I've owned the first DVD version which had nothing in terms of special features, I didn't own the 20th Anniversary but as for this Blu-ray it includes:* Commentary by Peter Billingsley and Director/Co-Writer Bob Clark - This commentary was actually quite fun to listen to.  You get a lot of Billingsley asking questions to Bob Clark about certain scenes, working with different individuals and also talking about the film and its reception from viewers in the last 20 years.  His relationship with working with Jean Shepard and much more.  There are some times where they are watching the film and don't say anything but I think both were pretty much rewatching the film for its entirety probably in a long time.  One scene I wondered about was the parade which featured Mickey Mouse.  I always wondered how Mickey could show up on an MGM film and sure enough Clark explains how Disney allowed it.* 20th Anniversary Documentary ""Another Christmas Story"" - This documentary features Bob Clark, Peter Billingsley and the guys who play his two buddies and the guy who plays Farkus.  Each talking about their experiences, the pole and tongue scene and how people react to them to this day and how people have memorized the lines.  And learning how a lot of detergent was used to re-create some of those snow scenes.* Daisy Red Ryder - This was an interesting featurette on the actual Daisy Red Ryder Air Rifle.  How it was created for the film and the actual company who produces air guns.* Get a Leg Up - This one is a infomercial like featurette of the leg lamp.  Nothing major.* Script Pages - This features the script of actual scenes that were cut.  Clark talks about several scenes that they didn't use in the film.  I wish they still had that and offered the videos as a deleted scene (especially the Ralphie/Flash Gordon scenes) but you can read the script of what was cut.* Trailer - And looking at the trailer, it looks so old in terms of picture quality after watching it on Blu-ray.For me, ""A CHRISTMAS STORY"" is like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and even ""Home Alone"".  Films that are Christmas classics that you just want to watch with the family during the holidays.""A CHRISTMAS STORY"" has been a part of so many families holiday's within the last 20 years and remains one of the classics next to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" (and other classics) shown every year and watched by many.  It's a true-to-heart tale and the way it's written, it's not fluffy, it's the life of a young boy who wants a Christmas present but his parents are not exactly ""Brady Bunch"", magical parents.  Blue collar father with a temper, mother who does her best to take care of the kids and a time in the 1940's of decoder rings and Ovaltine.If you own the 20th Anniversary DVD, really...you don't need to buy this.  But if you are like me and you own the first DVD version with no special features or the VHS version, then yeah, moving up to Blu-ray is a great decision.  It's marginally better in picture quality than the DVD and you get all the special features as well.Overall, it's a Christmas classic worth owning."	5.0	A Blu-ray released marginally better than the 20th Anniversary DVD but if you don't own this yet, buy this classic!	2008-12-13	5	4	1
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3P4S2XYTZ880I	dennis	I grew up  in the era this film is set. Ralphie could have been me, and Darren Mc Gavin, he Father, could have been mine. He was a Ford man, and would defend his choice of car like Mc Gavin loved his Oldsmobile's.  His salty language was used around the house, much to my mothers' distressed and when I let one epitaph lose, I was given the lifebuoy soap treatment. And she wondered where I had heard it?  My mom didn't want me to get a Red Ryder BB gun, and used the same dialog &#34;you'll shoot your eye out&#34;.  I had a younger brother who wouldn't eat his vegetables, and would stick them anywhere except his mouth.  My Dad was an expert at fixing things, and somehow thought swearing helped. One of my  friends actually was talked into sticky his tongue on a pole in winter. Our Christmas tree had those 7 watt bulbs that could burn down a tree if the extension plug didn't burst into a &#34;blue ozone&#34; before. The film is set in a northern city like where I grew up.  We would go to downtown and look into the Christmas displays. It was one of our rituals that have been lost. And since most of us did not get toys, except for Christmas, it was more special than today. Like most grandparents of my generation, we have spoiled them, and Christmas just isn't like it was in my time as a child.	5.0	This film is my favorite Christmas flic	2013-12-22	2	1	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3FGW4W4S95095	D. Ferrigno	This movie was made for my generation yet somehow I had not seen it until today, thirty years after its release.  It is very much hyped as one of the best Christmas films of all time and amazingly funny.  The reality is that it neither pans out as humorous nor truly a Christmas film.  The acting is fine and the story is reasonably written but it is devoid of the sort of moments and laughs that make a supposedly memorable film memorable.  It is not a not-my-taste issue but simply, not a particularly good movie.  It is quite simply boring.  If not for the few elements of nostalgia, it would be of absolutely no value whatsoever.  It would seem that this is yet another example of the simpleness of people who prefer to mindlessly adhere to hype rather than make independent evaluations as if somehow dissenting would be a source of personal embarrassment.  Furthermore, for a so-called wholesome family film, there is a fair amount of profanity in it to which I would choose not to expose young children.	2.0	Barely about Christmas, barely worth seeing.	2013-12-22	6	1	5

Basically, it looks almost the same as the DVD, which is pretty good for an older movie. If you already own any of the DVD versions, there is little need to upgrade to the Blu-ray version. If don't have own a copy, them the Blu-ray version should be in your collection if you're a fan of the movie. There's also an ""Ultimate Collectors Edition"" just released, but it doesn't include any new scenes or extras on the disk. It includes a metal tin, some other goodies, and costs about $15 more. The movie gets 5 stars for being a Christmas classic. The Blu-ray disk get 4 stars for being nothing special."	4.0	A Christmas Story [Blu-ray]	2008-12-14	6	6	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AFP8RT4RPTSPH	"D. Irving ""Over the Top Ragamuffin"""	"I've owned the previous barebones single disc DVD as well as the pretty impressive 2-disc widescreen version. So this purchase was a no brainer for me. There is always a question of improvement in picture/sound quality when upgrading from standard def to high def, particularly with a film over 20 years old. I'll just get it out of the way right off the top. The 1080p video is just beautiful. Is this as good a transfer as ""Batman Begins?"" Well, d'uh! NO. Is it better than the previous DVDs of ""A Christmas Story?"" Heck, yeah! Detail is rich and there is hardly any compression artifacts or video noise whatsoever. One could almost count the individual fibres of the fur on Santa's suit. Film grain is present, but it should be since this is, um, a film. I did detect what appeared to be mosquito noise in the moonlight reflected on Ralphie's face as he happily falls asleep on Christmas night, but that's the only nit I can find to pick at. But all in all this is a pretty great video transfer.The Dolby Digital Plus 1.0 mono track is fine, I guess. I really can't comment too much, being more of a videophile than an audiophile. But I'm sure it's a sonic improvement over the pedestrian Dolby Digital track from the standard def packages...Warner Bros has ported over all the supplementals from the previous 2 disc version - even the two easter eggs, allbeit not hidden on this version but as part of the special features lineup. The supplementals were just fine on the last DVD and they fit in nicely here. Of special note, the supplementals are presented in 480p widescreen, taking full advantage of your widescreen tv's full 16:9 frame. This is a good thing.~RANT~ WB and other studios used to present the special features of their DVDs in full 16:9 anamorphic glory, but have stopped this practice on their more recent home video offerings. Even if the feature was filmed in widescreen - a logical candidate for 16:9 treatment, no? - they are now too often reformatted to 4:3. Some of WBs HD-DVDs port over these unenhanced widescreen features which will be displayed on HDTVs STILL unenhanced...! Makes me crazy! WB and all other studios - I'm not asking for full 1080p, but please fill my screen. It's asinine to present a widescreen image in 4:3 letterbox! Oy... ~END OF RANT~All that to say this: The supplementals on ""A Christmas Story"" remain untouched and fill my 16:9 screen. And I'm happy.In summation, this is a fine HD-DVD package and it should bring much joy  to you for years to come. If you're on the fence, do yourself a favor and buy this HD-DVD. Enthusiastically recommended."	5.0	Classic Christmas in HD	2006-12-19	2	2	0

Stokes	"So many people cited this as their very favorite Christmas movie, and I'd never seen it, so  I figured I should watch it.Basically, it's about a boy in the 1940s who wants a BB gun for Christmas. It's set in the 1940s. Rather than a single, linear story, it's a series of scenes about their life in the 1940s. Did I mention that it's set in the 1940s? Argh. Obviously, the filmmakers spent a lot of time and money getting the setting just right, because they beat the audience over the head with it every chance they got. Drove me up a wall, in case you didn't notice.It's also got the first-person voice-overs from grown-up Ralphie. If you watched The Wonder Years, it's like that. A grown-up navel-gazing about his childhood. It's almost as entertaining as listening to someone tell you about their dreams.There were some amusing scenes, of course, and I even laughed aloud several times. And I really enjoyed the end. It was such a nice parent moment--that no matter how disappointing his own life was, he could still give that joy to his son.  Aww[...]I'd guess it would be a more appealing movie if I had an idealized view of childhood or of the 1940s (it was set in the 1940s, by the way). Unfortunately, I have neither. Or if I liked Hollywood's version of a ""cute kid."" I have kids. Three of them. They're cute--or were, when they were younger. I tend to find Hollywood's version of cute obnoxious and whiny.On the other hand, I can't agree with the (very few) negative reviews--almost all of which complained about either vulgarity or *gasp* a gun! for Christmas! *ack!*--either. It was the 1940s. Kids had guns. They had BB guns in the 1960s, too--well, the boys did, at least--I had to borrow my little brother's. And it's pretty obvious that vulgarity doesn't bother me--I giveBlazing Saddles5 stars.I'm glad I finally saw it, but I don't think I'll be watching it again."	3.0	don't understand the hype	2008-11-22	10	1	9
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is a warm holiday movie filled with memorable moments and genuinely funny circumstances set in a time that has ceased to exist in America. It's a simple child's tale of the all-American Christmas, capturing a picture-perfect portrait of holiday warmth and zest through its delectable combination of laughter and touching moments. Most importantly, the film recalls the pleasures of childhood during the Christmas season, and that can provide as much joy as any other film.The story is based on a segment of Jean Sheperd's novel &quot;In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash,&quot; a personal memoir of his experiences. It helps that Sheperd collaborated in the creation of the screenplay, as well as lending his narration as the adult voice of Ralphie Parker (played by Peter Billingsley), who wants nothing more than to wake up on Christmas morning and find a &quot;genuine Red Ryder 200-Shot Carbine Action Air Rifle&quot; under the tree. Ralphie doesn't merely want this gift, but yearns for it with every fiber of his childhood being. His convictions that an English paper on what he wants for Christmas, as well as putting in his request to Santa Claus, stand as his assurance that he cannot fail in his quest.Of course, there are obstacles, made whimsical and witty by director Bob Clark's wonderful knack for situational humor. His mother's words, &quot;You'll shoot your eye out,&quot; seem to echo from the mouths of everyone around, including his would-be alibi, Santa Claus, who is seen in a most frightening light by the children who line up to sit on his lap. Even Ms. Shields, his teacher, is a dead end, granting him a C+ on his &quot;All I Want For Christmas&quot; theme paper with a small note toting Mrs. Parker's infamous warning.The film is a very warm and inviting Christmas story, capturing the holiday season of yesteryear in an authentic and gleeful manner. Set in Indiana in the 1940's, Clark captures small vignettes of the time period through Ralphie's life experiences, from his eager anticipation of a secret decoder machine sent by the radio show he listens to every night at 6:45, to his punishment for using foul language by keeping a bar of Lifebuoy soap in his mouth for a prolonged period of time (&quot;Over the years, I got to be quite a connoisseur pf soap...&quot;).What helps the movie in the long run are its characters, who never overstay their welcome or lose the appeal they possess. Ralphie's parents, known only to us as Mom and the Old Man, are the perfect parents: his mother, played with supreme charm by Melinda Dillon, is a warm and caring woman, as shown in her methods of getting younger brother Randy to eat by referring to him as &quot;Mommy's little piggy,&quot; and in her protective yet nurturing nature in regards to her children. His father, a stern yet gentle man, is the ideal working-class family man who sits at the table, reads his paper, but still exudes a great deal of caring for his family. Darren McGavin's performance as Mr. Parker deserves high praise, especially in his childlike glee over winning a table lamp in the shape of a woman's leg.Billingsley is the most notable of these actors, instilling Ralphie with all the emotions and thoughts a normal child experiences. His run-ins with neighborhood bully Scut Farcus provides a truly satisfying scene of turning the tables, while his daydreams of getting an A+ on his English paper and his going blind from &quot;soap poisoning&quot; are filled wit merriment and humor.I think what &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; captures most effectively is the unbearable countdown to Christmas Day, which, for a child, can be the most excruciating twenty-four days of the year. Here is a movie that is guaranteed to bring back wonderful memories of childhood, with something that everyone from all generations can relate to, whether it be the joys of the long-awaited Christmas morning, or the shared pleasure of reliving the time and place, and the painstaking accuracy with which it is portrayed.	5.0	Full of warm characters and genuine humor!	2001-12-26	4	4	0

We walked to Central Grade School in several feet of snow in the winter.  There were no school busses to keep us warm and toasty.  Mom packed my lunch and I carried it to school in a tin Superman lunch box, or a brown paper bag from the Kroger store on the corner of the block.  A Christmas gift of a Daisy air rifle was a boy's passage to becoming a responsible young man.  We didn't shoot at one another or damage anybody's property because we knew when we went home that evening the ""Old Man"" would find out from a neighbor.  Then I would certainly get a spanking and would loose my privilege of playing with my shiny new Daisy air rifle.  This time in Americana was the best time for children to learn and live the values which produced the ""Greatest Generation"" who built the American dream.  The neighborhoods were safe for children to play outside and have snowball battles and sled ride down ""Suicide Hill.""  The modern world with both parents working and children being housed in daycare, or raised by a village, has created a tear in the fabric of the family.  I really feel sorry for the children of today because they have not lived ""A Christmas Story.""

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1ZH086GZYL5MZ	Doug DeBolt	"So often Hollywood tends to treat Christmas with such idealism that the holiday movies all begin to look the same. That's why ""A Christmas Story"" stands out so wonderfully. Life is imperfect in Ralphie's (Peter Billingsley) home - which makes him just like the rest of us. His mom is a nag, his dad uses foul language (beautifully gibberished by Darrin McGavin) and his little brother whines and won't eat his dinner. Meanwhile, Ralphie just wants the one thing for Christmas that no one else seems to want him to have - a Red Ryder B-B gun (because ""he'll shoot his eye out...). ""A Chirstmas Story"" is fun throughout, and the characters are people we know and people we just might be. For kids, it's a snapshot into the lives their parents might have lived. And for parents, it's a look back at a simpler time when misbehaving in school meant daring someone to stick their tongue to the flagpole. This is one movie which is a standard in my household and is definitely worth adding to your Christmas movie collection."	4.0	A Christmas worth owning	2002-02-11	1	1	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AMO3NCG95J80Q	"Doug Thompson ""laffnstock"""	I have grown up with this film, along with Willy Wonka and Home Alone.  And when I watch it today, it takes me back to my childhood days.This isn't top-notch DVD quality, but still better than TNT's, despite digital DVD technology.About the movie: some of the same sound effects and accompanied songs are heard at least twice in this film.  If you listen closely, you'll notice the repetition.  And as for the language, FYI, the old man says &quot;cripes&quot; every time (thank goodness).  Of course, who can forget the undecipherable phrases he blurts out  when he attacks the furnace, hehe.  Listen more closely and you can also discover some dub-overs made throughout the film.  Aside from the &quot;B&quot; word used a couple times, this film isn't too bad languagewise, but lots of phrases sound like garbled recordings.  (Example: the old man said &quot;Not A Finger!&quot; because he didn't want the mother to lay her hands on his broken, plastic lamp.)I should be ashamed to say this, but when I was a kid, the Santa portrayed in this movie used to get me excited for Christmas Eve when he would go down the chimney and deliver presents.  Now, I realize that's not what Christmas is about.  It's about celebrating the joy of our Lord, and loving one another.	5.0	Not as realistic as other films, but true Christmas classic	2001-12-05	6	2	4

I seriously considered buying it last year, but I never got around to it, and I am glad I waited.

GUN, IS SOMEWHAT MORE LOFTY!IN A NUTSHELL:RALPHIE IS A BOY ON A MISSION -- A CHRISTMAS MISSIONHere we have the ideal young boys Christmas yarn, adapted from a memoir by humorist Jean Shepherd, who narrates throughout the film.NEVERTHELESS - FOR RALPHIE ITS ALL ABOUT REACHING HIS GOAL:We have a lofty goal - THE RED RYDER BB GUN under the tree! To reach this goal he must overcome the growing din of naysayers including his teacher and mother who insist: ""YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT!!!!!!To reach that goal we have objectives - giving clues to mom and dad, getting Miss Shields [5th grade teacher] to endorse the idea, and going directly to ""THE MAN"" - SANTA, to enlist his support.BUT THERE IS MORE - MUCH MORE!For starters, we have a ten year old's strange fantasies - having ""BLACK BART"" and his gang all ""pushing up daisies"" after a showdown with cowboy Ralphie and ""Old Blue"" [his Red Ryder].We have a dare that goes from bad to worse as it escalates into a ""Triple Dog Dare""! What ensues, is simply something that we suggest you don't try at home. That is, unless you want to get your tongue frozen stuck to a pole?We have Bully's and their henchmen. We have really cool narration. Plus, we have Dad and his major award silliness, when he isn't fighting furnace fires, the Buppases dogs and just plain acting uncool in a perfect dad sort of way.Add to that, we have Chinese turkey and christmas themes, flat-tires, a soap poisoning fantasy, a little boy wearing a little girl's pink bunny outfit and the long awaited ""Little Orphan Annie"" decoder set with a letter countersigned by Annie in real ink! We have a little brother, an epiphany over mom and some typical school chums getting into trouble stuff too.There is very nice mood music mostly by Brass Ensemble, when its Christmas, and more fully orchestrated for ""The Grand Canyon Suite"" and other familiar tunes that are appropriate to the period [late 1940s in Northern urban Indiana]BOTTOM LINE:Super-duper entertainment that you can enjoy with the whole family. It never gets tiring and it actually grows on you over time. I first saw ""A Christmas Story"" at the Vero Beach [FLA] Drive-In in 1983, and I have looked forward to seeing it, dozens of times, since.ABOUT THE DVD:I have never seen the 2-Disk set. The single disk, full-screen version I do have is quite an improvement over the VHS version insofar as picture quality is concerned. There are NO FEATURES, and that is of course sad as this type of nostalgic film with child actors really would benefit from that. All in all, this is a great film to have on DVD as it seems to shout - PLAY ME AGAIN!"	5.0	"AVOIDING THE ""YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT"" NON-SENSE - IS RALPHIES OBJECTIVE!"	2006-01-14	3	3	0
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2BYV7S1QP2YIG	"Dr. Oceanfront ""Oceanfront"""	A Christmas Story tends to touch people's hearts like few films do. I think the reason is many of them are now Baby boomers entering retirement! and this film brings back the nostalgia of their 1950's childhood, and it strikes a nerve. Yet, I think this film was suppose to be written for the 1940's...no matter, it will touch you (but even more if you are over 50).This is Ralphie's story, but Melinda Dillon, playing the typical 1940's stay-at-home mom and Darren McGavin as the grumpy but kindly father made the story work.Here are some scenes most folks over 50 might even remember...though it seems like lifetimes ago:New and beautiful toys displayed in department store windows...in my case Macys. Buying toys by mail order and then the agonizingly long wait for toys ordered via mail and learning too late they are not quite what was expected. The excitement of buying a Christmas tree, the joy of setting it up and how much bigger Christmas trees seemed then. Neighborhood bullies who were not nearly as tough as they seemed. Ralphie wanting a BB gun more than life itself. Mom covering trouble for Ralphie to his dad, and the same mom making him eat soap for uttering words -- learned from Dad. Randy sitting underneath the kitchen sink when depressed. A panicky visit to a tired Santa. An unwanted gift from a well-meaning aunt. The furious unwrapping of gifts on Christmas morning. There is so much more, but my review is getting too long.So, if you are middle age or older and have not seen A Christmas Story (hard to believe), or if you are younger and have not seen it, you really are missing an extraordinary touching, yet funny film.Buy or rent this DVD and It will be the best money you spend this Christmas -- or any Christmas.	5.0	Classic holiday story	2014-03-07	1	1	0

This is the story of Christmas gone wrong in suburban America.  It isn't, however, a pessimistic view of the failure of Christmas, it is a look at the redemption of family love, and the sick wonder of being a child.Welcome to a world of sick lamps that are shaped like legs, of demented Santa-costume wearing mall workers, of a childs dream to own a simple BB gun, of dogs who eat Christmas dinner.  Quite simply, everything that is humorously wrong about Christmas in America can be found in this movie.  It is one of the most hilarious portrayals of Christmas on film, and will have you laughing at every turn.Watch it with the family.

Fifteen minutes before it ended, my father walked in and said that we would get the special edition.That I didn't go postal at losing an hour and a half on something that would shortly be redundant shows how much I love ""A Christmas Story."" This 1983 classic is not just a heartwarming little story about a loving (if bickery) family in the dour America of the late 1940s, but a hysterical comedy about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas.Ralphie Parker's (Peter Billingsley) Christmas wishes are simple: a official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass and a ""thing that tells time."" But his mom says he'll shoot his eye out. So Ralphie begins a quiet crusade to get it as a present -- he writes an essay on it and even asks Santa, only to get the same terrible reply: ""You'll shoot your eye out.""As the days tick down to Christmas -- with no sign of an air rifle -- Ralphie hits other obstacles when he clashes with bullies, says ""the mother of all dirty words,"" and watches his parents battle it out over a tacky ""major award"" (leg lamp). But there are surprises in store for the Parker family on Christmas morning -- and some of them involve smelly bloodhounds.Yes, the plot is pretty simple -- it's the delivery that makes it special. It's narrated by an adult Ralphie who offers his slightly sardonic take on everything (""We plunged into the cornucopia quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice""), mingled with a hint of nostalgia. And it's completely tuned in to how kids think, and how a toy can seem like the most important thing in the world.Fortunately the scriptwriters never condescend to the audience by adding some kind of syrupy message -- after all, real life doesn't work that way. Instead there are all sorts of classic moments -- the leg lamp, Chinese turkey, the terrifying visit to Santa (""HOOOO HOOOO HOOO!""), and Ralphie's fantasies of defending his family with ""Ol' Blue"" against a bunch of inept, unarmed bandits.And Jean Shepherd -- the co-writer and narrator of the movie -- deserves especial credit for bringing this movie to life. He covers the movie with a snowstorm of one-liners and hilarious dialogue: ""Over the years I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap."" ""He looks like a pink nightmare!"" ""Oh FUUUDDDDGGGE!"" and others.Billingsley is a little stiff as Ralphie, but gives the portrayal of this everykid his charming, slightly frenetic best. Melinda Dillon and Darin McGavin are the comic geniuses here, with their slightly kooky but loving parents (one of the highlights is Dillon's ""show me how the piggies eat!"" scene, and McGavin's revolted response), and there's an array of very convincing bullies and classmates too.""A Christmas Story"" didn't get much notice when it came out in 1983. But now it's one of the quintessential holiday movies, and a must-see at Christmastime. HOOOOO HOOOOO HOOOO..."	5.0	You'll shoot your eye out	2007-09-28	24	23	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A19VGM3OM1DK77	ed cohen	"I make it my business to watch ""A Christmas Story"" every holiday season.  A major part of the charm of the film is the fact that it takes place in the 1940's, when charm was still in vogue and simplicity dominated the times.  Ironically, this is unfortunate because if the film translates to today's times, the BB gun would translate into a Macintosh with Windows, 256 MB of Ram, etc.  You get the idea.I thought Darren McGavin stole the show.  My favorite scene involved him and Ralphie changing the tire.  When Ralphie loses the nuts to the hubcaps, he says the ""Queen Mother"" of all curse words; the big one that didn't come out as ""fudge"".  McGavin told him to get into the car.  The camera stays on McGavin and you notice the least bit of a smirk on his face, as if to say ""I know Ralphie's a good kid.  This is just part of his growing up"".On all counts, this is a gem of a picture, with marvelous performances, directing and writing.  Almost every scene is memorable and can be bantered about over the holiday table.  Even if you don't laugh out loud after the 100th viewing, it is still as entertaining and fresh as it is with the 1st."	5.0	"A ""MODERN DAY"" CLASSIC"	2002-11-06	3	3	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO	E. Hornaday	"""A Christmas Story (1983)"" is as perfect a holiday movie as was ever produced in Hollywood. I applaud this Special Edition to be released, which provides the first-ever DVD version of the movie in the widescreen format, with a secondary disc of expected extras. If ever a Christmas movie deserved special treatment, it is this film.The movie is absolutely unique: a non-traditional yule time tale surrounding one special Christmas in the life of 9-year-old Ralphie Parker. Somehow, it manages at the same time to provide not just a laugh-out-loud hysterical glimpse of events, but a loving, tender, almost reverential look at homespun holiday traditions and cherished American values. In doing so, it completely transcends the genre and becomes not just a classic first-rate holiday movie, but a classic first-rate movie. In fact, Siskel and Ebert put it on their 10 best films list of 1983.Based on a segment from the brilliant novel ""In God We Trust,"" by Jean Shepherd (who also helped pen the screenplay and narrates the movie as the adult Ralphie), the story is set in Indiana during the 1940s, but was filmed with a timeless quality evoking the rich images of Norman Rockwell illustrations unexpectedly combined with touches of Tim Burton-like looniness. Well-deserved kudos should go to Director Robert Clark III.Like most kids, Ralphie's world revolves around Christmas and enduring school until the holiday break. This year, Ralph has been waging a campaign to receive the greatest Christmas present in the history of Christmas presents: a Red Ryder BB gun, with a compass in the stock. Unfortunately, his mother believes he is likely to ""shoot his eye out,"" so she is resolutely against the gift.It is against this backdrop that we meet Ralph's family, his mother and father (whose first names we never learn), and younger brother Randy, along with a host of Ralph's friends and his school teacher. We also meet the classic school ground bully, Scut (not Scott) Farcus, who is so vicious that he has yellow eyes (""I swear to God, yellow eyes""), and his little ""toadie"" henchman.Through the Parker family, we are privy to the weeks leading up to Christmas, and the grand day itself. Along the way, we are given so many memorable events that it is impossible to relate them all here. Meatloaf, the purchase of a Christmas tree, a certain curse word, a very ""leggy"" lamp, a tongue frozen to a flag pole, a grumpy Santa, triple-dog dare, Lifebouy soap, a blimp, Chinese turkey, and a movie-long battle between ""The Old Man"" and the furnace are only a few of the unforgettable gems.The talented cast, which includes Peter Billingsley as Ralphie and Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin as his parents, shine as brightly as Christmas stars.If you have never seen this movie, you owe it to yourself and your family to take this opportunity and watch it. The movie has the power to change the way you look at Christmas, and Christmas films forever. For me, it has become a yearly mainstay, as moving and memorable as ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" or any other holiday film. It is my Red Ryder BB gun, ""the best Christmas present I ever received, or would ever receive."""	5.0	Peace. Harmony. Comfort and Joy...Maybe Next Year	2003-08-25	15	12	3
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AHHNKZ27TB1ZY	E.H. Stevens	"First of all, this is, aside from Dickens' classic ""A Christmas Carol,"" the best Christmas movie ever made. If you and your family have still somehow missed seeing this movie, make sure to buy the DVD, or at least tune in Christmas Eve and watch it on TBS. It is the kind of movie that will be immortalized throughout time.The DVD is okay. The interviews are pretty decent on the 2nd disc, and the interactive games are fun. However, the biggest complaint I have is the lack of a remastered audio track. I incorrectly assumed that this would at least be in Dolby Digital 5.1, but then I realized it listed Dolby 2.0 mono. I said ""okay, well at least it's in 2-channel audio."" HA! After popping in the DVD to check it out, the only English track for the movie(without commentary) is in ONE channel audio, through the center speaker! YIKES! I'll keep this DVD for the time being, but I'll sell it or pass it on when I get my hands on a Blue Ray player and (hopefully) a Blue Ray disc with enhanced audio."	4.0	Wonderful Christmas classic, not-so-great DVD	2006-12-15	4	3	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A5BOJX3CM4XV4	"Emmit W. Stewart ""movie fan"""	"I really believe when the history of the movie industry is finally completed, four movies will be tied for best Christmas movie.  They will be; ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Miracle On 34th Street"", ""a Christmas Story"", and 'Home Alone"". Second place will go to one of the many versions of Dicken's ""A Christmas Carol"".  ""Christmas Story"" is my personal favorite of the four.I was somewhat surprised that the story was set in the forties. I had always that it was in the fifties when I was in my preteens.  On looking closer, I see that it could have just as easily been the thirties, forties, fifties, or even the early sixties. The movie is really set at a time outside of history called ""childhood"". The true wonder of this movie is how vividly it brings back memories of early youth, no matter when you were born.Give full credit to Jean Shepherd. The measure of the success of this movie is the faithfulness in which it brings his characters and stories to life.  His narrative in voice over is one of the highlights of the film. The wonderful combination of sentiment and satire sparkles through the show like bubbles in a glass of ginger ale. Not too sweet and just sharp enough.Enough said about the movie itself. It's a classic and you need it in your collection.  You owe it to your family.This version, the twentieth anniversary, double disc special edition is exceptionally good.  After viewing the movie, go back and view it with the commentary by Bob Clarke and Peter Billingsley. That alone is worth the price of the set.  But, that's not all. There's also a whole extra special feature disk with goodies for the whole family. There's the true story of the the Daisy Red Rider BB gun, a featurette showing the making of the movie and.. Wonder of Wonders... a trip to the Factory that makes the Glorious LAMP. There are also some nice interactive games for the kids, but the biggest treat on the second disk is the audio readings by Jean Shepherd of two of the stories from which the movies were made. I don't care if you did just see the movie. He will hold you spellbound in front of the image of an old radio.  He is that good!I wish that I had more stars to give this set.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	There must be at least a hundred films and TV specials that deal with Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, etc. All of them range from the greatest to the worst, and A Christmas Story is one of the greatest. A majority of this country's population have seen this film, and I'm sure all of them now love it right after they've watched it (well, ALMOST all of them, now that I've seen the current reviews here on Amazon). I should be included on the list of those who love it. I mean, this is a definite classic. It's both hilarious and touching at the same time. Along with It's a Wonderful Life and Home Alone, every single minute of this film is almost flawless. It's also one of those films in which you can memorize much of the dialogue, not to mention the many sight gags (tongue on frozen pole, anyone?). I think my favorite scenes are the ones involving soap and lamps . . . I won't give out any spoilers for those who haven't seen it yet. Speaking of which, if you haven't seen this Christmas classic just yet, give it a shot, especially on Christmas Eve. You'll quickly understand why it's considered one of the greatest Christmas films of all time.Grade: A	5.0	Always funny, always touching, and NEVER overrated!	2009-12-21	0	0	0

Schmidt	"Revised 12/09:  The 2003 ""Anniversay"" edition of the DVD is now out of print, making this the only deluxe version of the movie available at the current time.  A year ago, there were two identical Christmas Story DVD sets on the market at the same time, and this was the more expensive of the two.  Seeing as how this is no longer and issue, I'm upping the score for this item from three stars to five.Original review:Don't get me wrong - I love ""A Christmas Story,"" and I would give the film a 5-star review.  The issue here is that the 2008 DVD release is EXACTLY the same as the 2003 version (aside from some slightly different artwork on the slipcover and case).  There are no new special features, and the print quality is the same as before.  There is absolutely no need for the studio to release this needless double dip DVD.  If you don't already own the 2003 version, then this is a must have DVD; if you do, there's no need to buy the new version, unless you go for the Ultimate Collector's Edition, which has some neat extras (which admittedly aren't worth the price if you already own the film on DVD).

Don't get me wrong, the VHS was good, but DVD's are always much more clear, and you can get really neat special features on them.When 9-year old Ralphie Parker starts obsessing about a Red Ryder 200 shot range model air rifle around Christmas time, he will come up with any scheme to get his parents to know that he wants that for Christmas. In the way of doing, he must dogde getting in trouble with his parents for saying terrible words, beating up school bullies, and complaining. He must somehow get his teacher to sympathise with his plot too, with a theme for homework, and maybe a little bribe here and there. All these things may lead to Mayhem, but they sure do make a funny story when it comes to getting gifts. Will Ralphie prevail with his dream gift or will Santa smash his hopes? Only Christmas will decide that.I thought the acting was great, especilly with Ralphies little brother Randy, always being a pushover. I recommend this movie to anyone, but I also recommend the book, &quot;In God We Trust, All others pay cash&quot; by Jean Shepard.

Every Christmas this film always played non-stop on the TNT network that should probably will ruin its welcome. But it doesn't. I just gave it four stars because I don't this isn't all perfect. But Jean Shepard delightfully narrates the story during the 40's and it's about a boy named Ralphie(Peter Billingsley) who desperatly wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas. Chaos ensues for poor Ralphie because everyone bawks and says ""You'll shoot your eye out!."" I like the characters very much including Ralphie's dad who loves his prize from a radio contest: a sexy leg lamp. One of my favorite scenes is during Ralphie and his brother visit a department store Santa and bawks the same mantra: ""You'll shoot your eye out"" and hits Ralphie's head and says, ""Ho, Ho, Ho."" But there's one scene that everyone remembers when Ralphie's friend is ""double-dogged dared"" to stick his tongue to a frozen pole at school. He does and it's hilarious! This film is sweet in alot of ways, it gives us a sense of realiom as well as warm humanity. Billingsley is great by the way who presents us with fun skill. So everyone drink egg nog, open your presents and watch this hoilday classic with your family on Christmas day."	4.0	"""You'll shoot your eye out!"""	2003-12-21	1	1	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2Z1K2I2EYSKFA	FrontPage	"I see that readers are steadily panning the Christmas Story special edition DVD because they feel that the matted film version is somehow cutting them short on their movie, but I have learned plenty on spherical (matted) films, widescreen, letterboxing and even the dreadful ""Super 35.""Many of the movies filmed now are being shot with film that is actually in NTSC television aspect ratio (1.33- 1.37:1), even though the movie in the theatrical release is either ""widescreen"" 1.85:1 and even letterboxed (2.35:1).Christmas Story was filmed in the spherical format by using matting. The theatrical presentation is identical to the presentation on the DVD @ 1.85:1 when matted. But the reason the producers enjoy this deceptive format is so that the transfer to the old TV format won't lose vital subject content since the movie isn't cropped but expanded when the mat is removed to allow the film to fill your TV screen.The same deception is evident with films like Kill Bill and many of the movies filmed by directors who swear by the format like James Cameron. Terminator 2 for instance was filmed in Super 35, which uses a matting process that is a hybrid format; this allows the director to frame in letterbox using matting process to maintain the widescreen, and the matting process is removed so that the actual film (shot in TV format) will be transferred to TV without the need of cropping, which streamlines the film to video transfer as a money- and time- saving option.Spherical process is used in such titles as Bull Durham, Terminator, American Pie, Caddyshack I and II, and Glory.Super 35 is used in titles like American Beauty, 8 Mile, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Matrix and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.True letterbox movies use an anamorphic process that compresses the image by using a special lens on the camera to compress the image as it strikes the unexposed film. As the processed film is shown, a special projection lens is needed to draw the image back out, extending the image into widescreen. But if the decision is made to make a film transfer to fill the TV format, over 1/3 of the image would need to be cropped, and the transfer generally would mean using a ""pan and scan"" process to allow the image to be seen.Examples of the process: Star Wars Episode IV (A New Hope), the Die Hard trilogy, Jaws, and Hunt for Red October.Because the anamorphic process used in filming yields true wide screen, you'll see plenty of pan & scan whenever the movie is transferred to full frame; however, with matted and Super 35, you'll actually see more of the top and bottom of a movie filmed with this process. There are sometimes things like microphones that can be seen in the full screen presentation since matting makes it difficult for the director to see such things during filming. Any DVD that has both ""widescreen"" and ""full screen"" videos will give you a great comparison. For those who want to see more detail on the film process and tech specs, try imdb.com, which gives great information on probably any title you are curious about.The film industry has no standardized format, which leads to this unnecessary confusion. And with the new digital medium in home video and movie production, I'm sure the screen aspect ratio information will get even more confusing. But don't send back your DVDs."	5.0	Matted? Cropped?

Watch it every year for Christmas. Maybe its because I have seen it every year since I can remember. Maybe because it seems so close to home. Maybe I wish my family was like that, and it kinda makes you feel what it was like when Christmas actually WAS Christmas. It is not about gifts, ipods, iPads, computers, technology, or any of that garbage that means nothing. Its a story about a family from a kids perspective when all he really wanted was 1 simple gift, and his quest to get there. The writing is great, and its just a fun movie to watch. It has it all.

I  laughed when I was a kid because my parents were just as bad.  I laugh when I'm an adult because...now I'm the dysfunctional parent doing the exact same stuff.  The acting is so good that I sometimes have to remind myself that the kids in the movie haven't died of old age yet because the plot takes place in the 1940s.	5.0	It never gets old!	2013-11-15	1	1	0

The next day I went to work and one of my fellow workers comes up and asks if I saw it. I said &#34;Yeah! It was great! Reminded me of when I was a kid! And the guy who played the father looks just like my Dad!&#34; My friend says &#34;Yeah! Me too! Not that the father looked like my Dad but we had a car just like that. And the town in the film was just like my hometown too.&#34; I said 'Yeah mine too!&#34; We could relate to this film more than probably any other movie ever made. It was like looking at a film of our individual youth histories! He grew up in Pontiac and Flint Michigan with all the car factories and I grew up in Allentown/Bethlehem Pennsylvania with Mack Trucks and Bethlehem Steel! We had a huge store in my town named &#34;Hess's&#34;, five stories tall and half a city block square. Huge. Everybody shopped &#34;Hess's&#34;. It's not there anymore. Sorry to say that. Of course I'm not there anymore either. But it was just like the store in the movie! And the toys were pretty much the same too. I never had a BB gun. An air rifle but no BBs! And my dad worked nights (and days too. he had two jobs!) so I hardly ever saw him growing up. I had a sister, my buddy had two brothers. But the town and the school depicted were just like ours. The film takes place somewhat earlier in time than when he or I were young boys of eight but not by much. We grew up in the 50s. The film takes place either in the late 30s or the early 40s or maybe the later 40s. Can't really tell. My Dad had a 49 Buick Roadmaster! A real tank of a car! Huge. Very simliar to the car in the film. And to top it off Ralphie looks like me when I was eight! Love this movie! But why buy it when TBS runs the film every Christmas for 24 hours? Just had to add it to my collection! Enjoy!	5.0	A Christmas Story to relate to! It's like a real memory for me! Love it!	2013-10-05	0	0	0
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A14OG7ZIKCYINO	G. Lichman	"Anyone who hasn't already seen this movie must.  It has, as it should, earned a place in history next to A Miracle on 34th St. and It's a Wonderful Life as a Christmas Classic movie.  Most people over 30 years old, and few under, will be able to relate to Ralphie, the nine year old boy who tries throughout the entire movie to convince his parents, teacher, and even Santa Claus that he should get a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas.  But Ralphie gets the same response from everyone: ""You'll shoot your eye out.""  Ralphie does not relent in his pursuit of the Red Ryder BB gun, and shows life as a nine year old in other ways: Little Orphan Annie decoder pins, the neighborhood bully, double dog dares, having a little brother, swearing, and the next door neighbor's pack of hound dogs that constantly torment his father.The movie is based on a portion of the book ""In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash"" by Jean Shepherd."	5.0	A Christmas Classic	2007-01-04	1	1	0

I love this movie it's a great holiday classic that I look forward to watching every Christmas and if I simply can't wait that long (which is every year) I just pop in the movie and watch it any time I want.My children each have a copy on VHS and this year we bought it on DVD. They love it as much as I do. And why not? Its a great movie, I know it's not It's a Wonderful Life, or Miracle on 34th ST, but it's a great Christmas movie just the same.I remember watching it as a kid and laughing so hard I nearly fell off my chair. It's a great movie for the whole family to watch together.I love the funny little scenes like the ""Triple Dog Dare"" and when the icecicle knocks Ralphie's glasses off and he thinks he really did shoot his eye out like everone told him he would do. And how about that awful lamp of his dads??The whole movie every one tells Ralphie ""You'll shoot your eye out kid!"" yet he still has his heart set on getting one that he does everything he can to get one. Like some kids, he just had to learn the hard way and gave us a good laugh in the process.I would recomend this movie to anyone that likes a good humerous, yet sweet Christmas movie."	5.0	LOVE IT!!!	2005-12-31	1	1	0

Unlike, ""Stand By Me"", where the narrator feels intergral to the movie, in this case, it seems tacked on, like a TV laugh track.  Considering, what the narrator tells us is essential to following the plot, it's a shame they didn't pick an actor with a better voice.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A127KQT1M7NLY3	Gregory P. Lamanna	"This is an ALL-TIME CLASSIC FAVORITE of mine. Being a film-purist (MA in cinema studies--my shameless plug), I do not say this lightly.10-stars for the movie and 1 star for the DVD. Read on:This is ""liquid literature"", i.e., literature on film. This is one of the few instances in filmdom where voice-overs are not only used properly, but are motivated by the film's style, disposition, and character. Form definately dictated the function of voice-over on this one, as should always be the case. Hearing Jean Shepherd's (author) voice-overs alone justifies the price of this DVD.But ALL aspects are flawlessly executed: writing, director's tone, acting, texture/mood created by lighting, sets, ensemble cast (the children's performances match those achieved by Spielberg in ET), etc ... Darren McGavin sunk personal resources into this project as a ""labor of love,"" and we are blessed, for what a tragedy to filmdom had this film never been realized.However, DVD itself is a disappointment. It is full-screen, not widescreen. I echo the comments made by previous users. This film is worthy of a complete digital remastering, both visually and aurally, and released in widescreen. I'd gladly pay a special price for such a classic edition of this timeless treat. These technical setbacks would not matter on a less-important work. But treating this film as a ""cheapie knockoff for a fast buck"" angers me.C'mon!

No matter how many times this film is shown (and TBS shows it constantly during Christmas), it still resonates and you never get tired of it.  It has a feel of an old time, old Hollywood Christmas story.  There is no foul language (even the old man's obscenities are muffled by the onery furnace), but it isn't an overly sentimental, cheesy film.  Not even close.  It's just an extraordinarily well made film.  All the jokes work, and there isn't a lull in the entire thing.  Every performance is wonderful, from Peter Billingsley to Darren McGavin to Melinda Dillon.  There are so many classic sequences that one has trouble decifering which is the best (mine is ""Chinese turkey"").It's hard to believe that Bob Clark, the man responsible for the raunchy, sleazy Porky's films and the wretched Baby Geniuses film, directed this film, but he did a wonderful job.  It would be a better story if this was the only film he made, but regardless, he deserves every word of praise that comes his way.  And, of course, the source material by Jean Sheperd is so wonderful, which always help immensely.  This is a wonderful film that can be seen at any time...."	5.0	I want Chinese turkey...	2007-11-22	10	10	0

I've seen it a million times and yet it still makes me laugh. Every Christmas I look forward to seeing it on tv.  We've all been there when we were children, wanting that one toy, video game system, CD player, etc.... our main character in this movie is no different.The movie takes place in a small midwestern town in the 1940's.Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants, more than anything, to own an official Red Rider BB gun. Everyone he asks tells him he's gonna shoot his eye out. His parents, his teacher and even Santa Claus himself. What is a kid to do? We also get to see the everyday trials and tribulations Ralphie goes through, an annoying little brother, the bully at school and the everday battles with his mother (Melinda Dillon) and his father (Darren McGavin, who was probably my favorite character in the movie). Alas, our movie has a happy ending and it is a Christmas Ralphie will never forget.This is a great family movie. It's a really great movie for all ages. We can all relate to what Ralphie goes through, we've all been there, and this type of movie can really bring out the kid in all of us. So if you haven't seen A Christmas Story, may I  suggest you check it out and I'm sure it will be a Christmas family tradition for a long time to come.	5.0	A Movie For The Kid In All Of Us!...	2002-06-25	6	3	3

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A23INOBJ1LVGNM	G. Wayne Cochran	"A Christmas Story is one of those movies that was under appreciated when it was first released but has become a holiday classic.Young Ralphie Parker wishes for nothing but a ""Red Ryder carbine-action, two hundred shot Range Model air rifle with a compass in the stock and this thing which tells time"" (a sundial) for Christmas. But it seems that at every turn, adults are standing between Ralphie and his BB gun with the constant admonition of ""you'll shoot your eye out."" A Christmas Story recounts the various misadventures of a young boy on a quest for Santa to bring him the best Christmas present ever, while trying to stay out of trouble, staying out of the way of the neighborhood bully, and avoiding the consequences of ""triple dog dares.""A Christmas Story is narrated by author Jean Shepherd as the adult Ralphie. Shepherd's vivid narration is one of the defining elements of this movie. This movie will entertain the kids and remind adults of their own childhood Christmas stories.A Christmas Story is rated PG for language and some rude humor. Most of the language is self-censored (in scenes where ""the Old Man"" goes into a profanity riddled tirade, the words are all gibberish.) There are only a couple of times that a single obscenity isn't self censored, and even then, it isn't any stronger than anything you would hear on prime-time network television. Overall, A Christmas Story is a great movie to share with the family."	4.0	A Christmas Story: A Christmas Classic	2012-12-01	3	2	1
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A8OU2FHE8QWFS	Gwyneth Calvetti	Some families make a ritual of watching &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; or &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; each holiday season.  Not ours; our top choice is this hilarious view of one Christmas season in Ralphie's life, as seen retrospectively by him as an adult.More a series of picaresques in the life of a little boy who wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas than a full storyline, it takes us on a journey through childhood, going from the little brother who must be allowed to eat like a pig to eat at all, to the town bullies and their continual harrassment, to the father who wins a &quot;valuable prize&quot; one day in a newspaper puzzle contest.  Throughout, Ralphie is plotting ways to still get the gift of his dreams, the Red Ryder--&quot;you'll shoot your eye out&quot;-- BB gun.Part of the charm of this film is the narration of Ralphie as an adult looking back on part of his childhood, but it also has many universal themes that are so common to kids, no matter what era.  The bullies, the longing for a seemingly unattainable thing, the playground dares, the constant daydreaming--all these are presented in an entertaining fashion that still causes us to think, &quot;Yeah, I remember that.&quot;  Our kids are watching this and saying, &quot;That is just like when I...&quot;  This is a wonderful piece of silly escapist nonsense that all members of the family can truly enjoy.	5.0	Christmas mayhem for the whole family!	2000-11-28	1	0	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AXC2AS1I00UWZ	Harv	Just a quick note to &quot;Jamie&quot; who hates this movie--how can you possibly recommend that our children watch and subsequently enjoy the R-rated &quot;Roger and Me&quot; but thoroughly trash this wonderful  movie?  There's only one cuss word uttered throughout the entire course of  this film, and what person on this planet hasn't been moved to utter  something very similar when faced with the same type of utter  disappointment that Ralphie was? CHILL OUT!Now, on to the main  attraction: this is one gem of a Christmas-time, family-oriented movie!  Perfectly cast and acted, beautifully filmed and expertly representing the  1940's of the Midwest, Jean Shepherd's wonderfully comedic remembrances of  his early Christmas experiences really come to life on the big screen.  Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon are absolutely perfectly cast as the  typical 40's Mom and Dad.  They're spousal jousting is hilarious and a  wonder to behold, yet may ring very true with our own memories of dear old  Mom and Dad, while Peter Billingsly and Ian Petrella fit together really  nicely as the combative/frustrated/competitive siblings.  It's all here,  told in funny, touching and often hilarious ways; the &quot;I dare  you&quot; friends, the despair of having the write a &quot;theme&quot; in  class, the scarey walk home as you watch for and hopefully miss an  encounter with the neighborhood bully, the wonder and excitement of  listening with rapt attention to the radio programs of the day, and of  course, the tremendous build-up and anxious waiting for &quot;The Day&quot;  to arrive!  This fine film will conjure up those wonderful memories of  Christmas when we were kids, no matter what the generation or the decade.  The cheerful, hopeful glee that all children have when it comes to  Christmas-time is so beautifully and hilariously represented here that you  will still be enjoying your favorite moments long after the final credits  have run.  Watch it with your kids later this year as Christmas 2000 draws  near, and as with so many other families, you'll have a new family  tradition by next Christmas--watching this glorious film once again!	5.0	AN ABSOLUTE GEM, DESPITE CLAIMS TO THE CONTRARY!	2000-06-30	32	29	3
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2BEFSFOTSH0WZ	Hazel Carty	There is the Christmas depicted in those gorgeously photographed magazines and books.  And there is the Christmas depicted in A Christmas Story.  This is the Christmas that went awry that will always live in your heart as the one with the grin attached.  The life we really lived not the one we saw in the magazine.  You'll love it, you'll watch it every year. The cast is perfect, the story is real. The subplots of the bully, the bb gun, the contest, the Mom and getting Christmas pulled together are beautifully interwoven.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1VOTPR9VIUCX6	Heather	I have always liked this film since I saw it when I was in 6th grade....almost 10 years ago.  It's funny.  It relies on actual dialogue and not special effects...so it's obviously for children and adults old and mature enough to have an attention span that doesn't need computer generated effects to keep them from wandering off.  It doesn't glorify owning a gun (gosh, it isn't a semi-automatic weapon, Ralphy is NOT a gang banger!)  He's just a little boy who wants a BB gun. It doesn't promote violence, it promotes children standing up to a bully, and finally, all children who can speak cohearantly KNOW what naughty words are, and that's why they put that in the film.  If people today just aren't teaching their children about life, BB-guns, and that swears are bad...it isn't this movie's fault :) and they could just stick to the cartoon version of the Grinch :)  This film, however, is fun, cute, and you can watch it over and over and over again without getting sick of it :)  It's why TBS has a 24 hour marathon of it ever christmas eve!  It's rewatchability :)	5.0	Gotta love it	2001-12-24	2	2	0
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A26HFSVLAGULIM	"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi"""	"FOR RALPHIE ITS ALL ABOUT REACHING HIS GOAL WITHOUT THE USUAL ""YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT NON-SENSE!IN A NUTSHELL:Here we have the ideal young boys Christmas yarn, adapted from a memoir by humorist Jean Shepherd, who narrates throughout the film.FOR RALPHIE ITS ALL ABOUT REACHING HIS GOAL:We have a lofty goal - THE RED RYDER BB GUN under the tree! To reach this goal he must overcome the growing din of naysayers including his teacher and mother who insist: ""YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT!!!!!!To reach that goal we have objectives - giving clues to mom and dad, getting Miss Shields [5th grade teacher] to endorse the idea, and going directly to ""THE MAN"" - SANTA, to enlist his support.BUT THERE IS MORE - MUCH MORE!For starters, we have a ten year old's strange fantasies - having ""BLACK BART"" and his gang all ""pushing up daisies"" after a showdown with cowboy Ralphie and ""Old Blue"" [his Red Ryder].We have a dare that goes from bad to worse as it escalates into a ""Triple Dog Dare""! What ensues, is simply something that we suggest you don't try at home. That is, unless you want to get your tongue frozen stuck to a pole?We have Bully's and their henchmen. We have really cool narration. Plus, we have Dad and his major award silliness, when he isn't fighting furnace fires, the Buppases dogs and just plain acting uncool in a perfect dad sort of way.Add to that, we have Chinese turkey and christmas themes, flat-tires, a soap poisoning fantasy, a little boy wearing a little girl's pink bunny outfit and the long awaited ""Little Orphan Annie"" decoder set with a letter countersigned by Annie in real ink! We have a little brother, an epiphany over mom and some typical school chums getting into trouble stuff too.There is very nice mood music mostly by Brass Ensemble, when its Christmas, and more fully orchestrated for ""The Grand Canyon Suite"" and other familiar tunes that are appropriate to the period [late 1940s in Northern urban Indiana]BOTTOM LINE:Super-duper entertainment that you can enjoy with the whole family. It never gets tiring and it actually grows on you over time. I first saw ""A Christmas Story"" at the Vero Beach [FLA] Drive-In in 1983, and I have looked forward to seeing it, dozens of times, since.ABOUT THE DVD:I have never seen the 2-Disk set. The single disk, full-screen version I do have is quite an improvement over the VHS version insofar as picture quality is concerned. There are NO FEATURES, and that is of course sad as this type of nostalgic film with child actors really would benefit from that. All in all, this is a great film to have on DVD as it seems to shout - PLAY ME AGAIN!"	5.0	RALPHIE IS A BOY ON A MISSION ---- A CHRISTMAS MISSION !!	2005-11-26	2	2	0

Ith thtuck!', or try to sing a Christmas carol with a heavy Chinese accent, she wouldn't understand the reference! She thought my fanatic insistance that everyone on earth had seen the movie and loved it was a mild exaggeration - until we went to the store to rent the movie, and the clerk kept saying to her as he scanned the barcode: ""C'mon you must have seen it on TV?--At least once?""So don't imagine your duty is finished once you've seen the movie and enjoyed it.

If you're looking for a change for the little ones - try Tim Allen's &quot;The Santa  Clause&quot;.  While I can see the point of the reviewer from Chicago - I think there are better choices FOR KIDS than this one - so don't get taken in by the big blue eyes.  It's not a kids' movie.  It's not just &quot;the F word&quot; - which doesn't get spoken (then I had to exlain why &quot;fudge&quot; was a bad word in this case...).  But not only is that scene bad enough, it is followed by the mom washing out Ralph's mouth and his ratting on his friend and then Mom calls the friend's mom.... it was not fun to dance around with my 6.5yr old who kept asking what Ralph really said. Fine - children will get exposed to all the horrible things in this movie in the reality of life - but c'mon - in a Christmas movie??  From an ADULT stand point - it was a nice movie, but not one I'd put on the list with It's a Wonderful Life.  Beating up the bully and horrible visits to Santa don't bring the Christmas spirit to my heart.	1.0	Not for kids says this mom.	2000-12-25	67	16	51

I bought a video copy when it came out on VHS; and I bought the DVD version when it came out a few years ago. This current DVD edition is the best yet. Compared to the orginal DVD, which I looked at for the sake of comparison, this 2003 edition has a much clearer image, better color, and a more balanced contrast. Although I have not been able to find any statement verifying my conclusion, I feel strongly the film has been digitally remastered for this special edition.

I grew up in Indiana just a little later than Shepherd and, while he was in Hammond (Hohman in the film), I was in Bloomington, but it still feels right.  Everyone wanted a Red Ryder bb gun and everyone's parent responded by saying ""You'll shoot your eye out.""  Everyone knew the consequences of putting your tongue on a frozen pump handle (or flag pole).  And lots of us had neighbors like the Bumpuses and their variety of hounds.  Look, if you want a look at Indiana life from a kid's view at that time in history, you won't find a better source."	5.0	It's midwestern life from 1940s!	2005-01-08	5	4	1
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1PH54ZAE7CVZ5	Hoosier	"I really like this movie.  It reminds me of Christmas when I was a kid around the age of 8.  Although I wasn't living during the time period of the movie, my parents were alive during that time and insisted on playing this movie every Christmas from 1983 forward.  I enjoy it now, as an adult because, when I watch it, I can hear my dad laughing at some of the scenarios presented in the film.  It was this movie that inspired my normally quiet father to regale us all with stories of his youth.  No matter how many times I see it, I find myself tearing up when his father tells him to look behind the desk for the hidden christmas present!I also enjoyed it because it was supposed to take place somewhere in my homestate of Indiana (proving that it is possible to get a solid english language education elsewhere in the state).With a little help from IMDB and in direct response to the previous ""writer"" from Hammond:To find an American city resembling an Indiana town of the 1940s, director Bob Clark sent his location scouts to twenty cities before selecting Cleveland, Ohio, as the site for filming.Ralph's school exteriors were filmed at Victoria School in St. Catharine's, Ontario, Canada.The film's setting is a town in Indiana, but was actually filmed in Cleveland, Ohio. The street the ""Parker's"" live in is called ""Cleveland Street"".The movie was based on a city in Indiana named Hammond. References were made throughout the film to support this claim. Examples: Harding school (on 165th St.) where Flick stuck his tongue to the flagpole (The flag pole that Flick got his tongue (notice the spelling!)stuck to was a theatrical prop), Goldblatt's department store, the mention of Griffith (a city that borders Hammond), Cleveland Ave and other streets that are located in Hammond. Although the movie was not filmed in Hammond the houses and look of the film is very authentic. Jean Shepherd (Writer) grew up in Hammond.Parts of the movie, including the Christmas tree shopping scene, were filmed in Toronto, Ontario. One of Toronto's trademark red trolleys can be seen driving by the shot of the outside of the tree lot.The Department Store featured in the Santa scene is really Higbee's in Downtown Cleveland. There were no Higbee's in Hammond.Enjoy the film!  I just watched it in Blu-ray format and it is amazingly clear!  There is also some nice footage of what the main characters look like as adults and the impact that being in this film has had on their lives."	3.0	Not filmed in Hammond, Indiana.	2006-12-21	7	2	5

The translation in spanish is so perfect that it helps me put some of the description in a proper context when I see it in english.The setting, the acting, the production and the story is mastefully orchestrated creating indeleble scenes that will always live in our memories. My son and I have always a good time remembering the scenes and the expressions from this movie, that I sure it will stregthen your codes and memories with your loved ones as well.I will have to say that the story is a bit acid and some of the parental punishments that I lived such as ""washing your mouth with soap"" are seldom seen today,  proper appreciation might can be expected with more age, yet I have seen that kids also enjoy this trip down a nostalgic era that neither them or I lived. When we showed it to my dad, his eyes glowed when he saw the ""Red Ryder rifle"".When I was a kid the ""Wizard of Oz"" was the movie per exellance- now kids do not even know that exists- so when our heroe sees his mother and school teacher turn (in his imagination) to the wicked-witch-of-the-west we can appreciate how well this scene fits in the overall setting of the movie.I will give anything away, for many reviewers have done that and each of us have a favorite scene. We can all relate to our little hero on his plight to make ask Santa the red ryder bb gun rifle, though I think many of us never lived to have a the store santa stepping on our face to slide us off down the north pole tobogan. I would say this is the perfect classic for parents who will also understand perfectly the oddities and affection mom and dad display through out the movie.If your kids are too small I am not sure it will be appreciated, this is a tale told by the narrator (who is remebering his childhood) in a very erudite manner, which is also part of what makes it enjoyable since it constrast with the simplicity of the kid, we can appreciate that but a small kid...I have laughed very much reading other reviewers comments that this forum has indeed made the movie more enjoyable, specially the comments made to that reviewer who only gave it a 1 star!!"	5.0	Warning: This movie can create serious viewing dependency	2007-08-09	4	4	0

The ensuing shenanigans with Ralphie at home and at school serves as a reminder of how endearing family can be during the holidays, no matter how weird the parts of the family are.What About It: No Christmas movie list is ever complete without this movie. Although it is realistically a generational movie for the children of the baby boomers, its charm carries on through the generations.Who doesn't remember a gift you really wanted that no one wanted to buy for you, or motherly love that turned you into a turtle on its back in the snow, or those weird footsy pajamas or ugly sweater that a relative gave you that your parents forced you to wear? Do you remember when your dad first heard you curse? How many kids wondered about their tongue sticking to a pole, just because no one had ever tried it? I remember all of that, and this movie serves as a reminder as to why I can laugh at the humiliation  and anger I had in those days.But it's a nice group of holiday memories, and through the casting and directing of this movie,we are brought into a wonderful film of nostalgia that the whole family can enjoy.	5.0	A Worthless Review on a Movie Everyone Should Already Have	2009-12-16	0	0	0

I've never seen A Christmas Story on TV or in stores in the UK. I doubt many people outside of the US know who Jean Shepherd is, or of his popular Ralphie Parker character. In fact, most people in general won't know that this movie is actually the fourth of (currently) seven featuring Ralphie.Adapted from the book In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, a collection of mostly Christmas-themed short stories, it remind me a lot of Christmas Vacation (adapted by John Hughes from his own Christmas '59 short story) in that it seems semi-autobiographic. But the adaptation of several stories gives the movie a sketchy feel, with a few that failed to resonate with me.The main story has little Ralphie Parker (brilliantly played by Peter Billingsly), a kid with imagination and cynicism beyond his years, beg his parents, and Santa, for a BB gun while dealing with a series of eccentric events in 1940s Indiana. It made me laugh quite a lot, but mainly in the second half. The cosy Xmas atmosphere is lovely, and there's not a shred of anything unwholesome. But I just can't see myself making this an annual tradition.I am sure many will disagree, but it does make me curious about checking out the other Ralphie Parker movies.The Blu-ray features a fine 1.78:1 1080p picture which accurately exhibits the film's retro color pallet and style. The sound is non-HD Dolby Mono, but it too matches the period setting. There are plenty of decent extras too. This Collector's Edition comes in a big tin box with a string of Xmas lights inside. The DVD counterpart contained an apron, cookie cutters, and a 50-page recipe book. I would much rather have had that than Xmas lights.	4.0	Not part of my annual line-up	2012-12-02	1	1	0

It is to me one of the best Christmas stories of the 20th century, rivaling ""White Christmas"", ""The Miracle on 34th Street"" and even ""It's a Wonderful Life"". It is in a class all to itself and is worth watching over and over."	5.0	Classic Christmas Tale	2012-10-27	1	0	1
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3IXZJ1L73DYTA	Jack E. Levic	"I've heard so much about A CHRISTMAS STORY through the years that I knew it was time to see this film. I've seen the Christmas items--the Leg Lamp and Ralphie dressed as a bunny so now it was time to see what it all meant.A plus to me was having Darren McGavin as the father. McGavin has been a favorite actor of mine since the KOLCHAK TV series.A CHRISTMAS STORY seemed to be off to a slow start author Jean Shepherd's narration was a bit annoying at first. It reminded me of THE WALTONS. But quickly, the pieces fell into place and it was evident as to what a delightful heartwarming film this is and why it should be an annual Christmas tradition for anyone.The Parker family is a quirky but loveable bunch. Darren McGavin stars as the father or ""the old man"" as he is affectionately called. Melinda Dillon is the mother. The old man seems quite a bit older than mother. Ralphie is the older son and Randy is the ""baby"" of the family.This Christmas season, Ralphie is obsessed with getting a Red Ryder B.B. gun from Santa and it is his goal to make it happen. The constant ""You'll shoot your eye out"" doesn't deter him in his quest.Here is a very sweet return to a kinder and gentler time when Christmas was a magical event filled with Santa Claus and holiday cheer. We didn't take ourselves so seriously in the 1940's. Adults who grew up in the 40's - 60's might relate to these special Christmases involving Santa at the Department Store and finding the ""perfect"" live Christmas tree.""The old man"" comes across as a bit of a curmudgeon but underneath he is a softie who loves his wife and sons. It was an era when the man had to seem tough and he ruled the house, or so he thought. Mother was the glue that held everyone together and she could soothe both husband and sons. The Parkers were a more realistic version of the perfect family.Ian Petrella as Randy, the younger brother, is a real scene stealer as the kid who idolizes his older brother. As the ""baby"", he is bundled up to look like the Stay Puft Marshmallow man barely able to move or keep up with his brother and friends on their way to school. Every day, they are chased by the local bullies and every day they take the same route to school to pass the bullies. Yep, there were bullies even back then.This film is filled with so many memorable moments. How about the leg lamp or the tongue frozen to a pole? What about a ruined Christmas dinner being saved by a meal in a Chinese restaurant. Maybe the Chinese staff trying to sing FLA LA LA LA LA becoming fra ra ra ra ra would be politically incorrect today but there is a sweetness to the scene. The staff is trying its best to make a happy and memorable Christmas for the disappointed family and guess what, they save Christmas for the Parker Family.A CHRISTMAS STORY is so sweet and so gentle on so many levels. If only, we could take a step back into time when Christmas had a meaning and families were together."	5.0	DELIGHTFUL AND NOSTALGIC LOOK AT CHRISTMAS PAST	2012-11-27	1	0	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2FNW654OSB917	Jamie	I've seen this movie every Christmas at my relative's house. I can honestly say I hate it. I've been searching for reasons why people actually think of this is as a classic up there with It's A Wonderful Life and A  Charlie Brown Christmas. Pretty much the same excuse of every person who  has seen this is that it reminds them of their childhood. I cannot contend  that. However, I think the movie is actually pretty mean-spirited and after  awhile pretty bland. In one sequence we have Ralphie uttering the F word  and then beating up this one kid to a bloody pulp (with his mittens!) Then  you have the scene where that one kid gets stuck to the pole with his  tounge. They seriously should have gotten Roald Dahl to direct this movie!  Not much of an ending either. He does get the BB gun however. Stick with  It's a Wonderful Life for your Christmas viewing pleasures.	2.0	Either you love or you hate it.	1999-12-18	62	7	55

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1VXX2DEWQ7KFD	"J. Cipale-Messerer ""Classics Queen"""	"It's not Christmas without watching Ralphie Parker dreaming of the Red Rider BB gun! In the 2nd one, the boys are all teenagers, planning on getting their drivers' licenses & with their eyes on 'cars' (aka junk mobiles that need a lot of work, but they're cheap to buy). Ralphie (yes, he is still called that at times!) also has a major crush on the star quarterback's girlfiend (watch out, here come the dream sequences). In order to earn money (not going to say why; don't want to give it all away), Ralph & Co. get jobs at--where else--HIGBY'S DEPARTMENT STORE! Yes, the same place where Santa pushed Ralphie down the slide with his boot & yes, at some point, the guys become Santa's elves. Fun movie to watch (the Old Man is still dealing with the blasted furnace) & has a great surprise ending, but as usual, the original is better than the first. For those who want more of 'Ralphie,' there is a summer vacation version with Charles Grodin as 'The Old Man' & Mary Steenburgen as he mother. The movie is ""My Summer Story."" It's set after the original 'A Christmas Story' & can be a fun diversion. I recommend this double edition set, plus ""My Summer Story."" For all Peter Billingsley fans, he is also a producer & director as well as an actor now. He played the elf checking on how many Etch-A-Sketch toys that Buddy made in ""Elf."" He is also the airline ticket agent at the who tells Vince Vaughn's & Reese Witherspoon's characters that their flight to Australia/New Zealand is grounded (& there are no other flights available) in ""Four Christmases.""

Told from the point of view of young boy Ralphie, the story covers his desperate longing for the mother of all Xmas gifts, the Red Rider carbine action single shot air rifle.As with any special edition DVD, there are a ton of extras.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3GGLOA55N0W2G	Jeff & Helen	This DVD will be a Christmas classic for years to come. It depicts the 1940's to perfection, right down to the porridge served up by Mom. This is a timeless depiction of a kid's ultimately fulfilled wish for that special  gift at Christmas. His parents, brother and other characters are hilarious.  Several of the scenes such as the unplanned Christmas dinner at the Chinese  restaurant are belly aching, tear producing fun. The final scene with the  lighted tree and heavy snow falling with a period Christmas carol in the  background is how we fondly remember Christmas at home.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3SJSNS9LW981O	Jeffrey J. Messenger	"Ralphie... a man before his time. A victim of BB gun ""gun control."" Harrassed by bullies, disillusioned by Little Orphan Annie products... Ralphie is maturing despite himself.The funniest scenes involve the stuffed stiff little brother, whose winter garb made him ""look like a tick about to pop.""  I thought my mother was the only over-protective winter alarmist!!Even small, unimportant moments make me laugh... such as when a ""Wizard of Oz"" style witch garbed woman is working the crowd lined up to see Santa starts bothering poor Ralphie, and calls him a ""tasty little morsel."" Ralphie, obsessed with soliciting the big red guy for his Holy Grail of Christmas Presents, responds...""Uh... leave me alone... I'm, uh... THINKING.""Ralphie articulates what all kids feel, he daydreams almost as much as I used to.Some forgivable weaknesses in this film is an over-used soundtrack, ""cluing us in"" as to when we're supposed to laugh... it's repetative music just gets in the way of the humor!Another forgivable flaw is how the movie is actually a series of events, loosely strung together by it's ""anecdote master"" writer. Still, that's how real life is... not every daily occurance is tied in to the next.The odd style profanity depictions of the father also takes some getting used to... ""glabber-puss, humbuckle dash-heimer!!""  We're supposed to imagine the actual terms... which are more commonly heard on television these days than in the movies in the 80s.Ralphie represents the childhood experiences most of us have had... whenever they grew up. It's timeless nostalgia!The DVD extra features serve us well enough, considering the fact that this movie was considered a theatrical ""flop"" of the mid 80s. It's been a mega-force Holiday tradition in the years proceeding!Jeff Messenger, author of the novel ""the Shroud of Torrington."""	5.0	Poor, poor Ralphie!!	2005-12-30	5	3	2

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3EO7N1F1NPF64	Jennifer Stevens	"There are very few movies which I can honestly say qualify as my ""favorites."" Even fewer among Christmas-themed movies. But ""A Christmas Story"" is certainly one of them.Why? Because I laughed as much watching it the 23rd time as I did the first. Because I can watch it every year and never get sick of it. Because I enjoy it as much now as I did as a kid (although for different reasons).The genius of this movie is its simple, heartfelt story and loveable characters. Every character seems to remind you of people you really know. You can relate to them and the story they're living. Who doesn't remember wishing and begging for that one must-have present?! And how exciting it was to open it up and see that you *actually* got it?!Who doesn't have parents who do things that are more-than-slightly embarrassing? Or whom you admired and feared at the same time as a kid? Or have a pesky brother, sister, cousin, or would-be friend who just wouldn't leave you alone? Or ever get pushed around by the school bully? (Unless you were the school bully, that is.)This movie is superb in that it appeals to all audiences. There is no violence, no blood-and-guts, no tragedy or trauma. There isn't even foul language -- although you'd think so with all the huffing-and-puffing the Old Man does. If you listen carefully, you'll notice that not one swear word is used in this movie -- only words that *sound* like swear words. Example: When the Old Man gets mad at Mother for ""accidentally"" breaking his Major Award and then ""using up all the glue"" -- he shouts ""Nottafingga!!"" Not really a word, is it?! But it sure sounded pretty bad!Over the years I have grown fond of the movie's characters, and I look forward to watching it every year and ""visiting"" with Ralphie, Randy, Mother, the Old Man -- even nasty Scut Farcus!! I think it would be difficult for you not the feel the same way about this movie."	5.0	One of the only movies I own -- with good reason!	2001-11-25	0	0	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3MQ672FYFNM7B	JGC	"""A Christmas Story"" is colorful, theatrical, musical, family-centric and meaningful and incredibly funny. This has always been my very favorite Christmas movie. As you may know there are about a zillion different ""A Christmas Story"" movie releases so although this review is about the movie, I will also be detailing the 2-disc DVD set that came out in 2003.I have fond memories of seeing ""A Christmas Story"" when it was still in the movies as a very young child. But this is the type of movie that everyone will love, it's not a movie just for children. The entire family will appreciate it.The story centers around Ralph Parker (Peter Billingsley) who longs for nothing more than a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas. Ralph will stop at noting to get his Christmas-fix. Although the children in the movie were all very talented and funny, I think I liked the parents the most.The father is played by the late and much-loved Darren McGavin and the mom is portrayed by Melinda Dillon. I love the parents because everyone has parents like them. Mr. Parker always came home angry at the world, but just as angry and caustic as he was, that's how kind and loving Mrs. Parker was. I also loved the character of Randy (Ian Petrella) because he had to be at least 8 or 9, yet he was still being treated like a 2-year-old. That's classic and so hysterical.The coup de grce has gotta be when Ralph goes buck-wild on Scut Farkus (Zack Ward). He just snapped and manages to get on top of the resident bully and just starts pummeling him with b-slaps, causing Farkus to start crying. I also love the part when Ralphie is forced to wear that hideous pink rabbit costume that his aunt sent him for Christmas. Because what child cannot relate to something similar happening; although I am sure nothing is as ludicruis as Ralph's bunny suit.Although the movie is shown during a 24-hour marathon every year I cannot think of a single reason why everyone should not own it. But, there are so many different releases, so it may be a little confusing to know which to choose. I prefer the 2-disc 2003 special edition set. Because it didn't cost much (that's most important and yes these are used but I couldn't care less) and because the packaging is great, it's looks like a Christmas gift (see the scans that I took the time to label and post) and it includes lots of bonuses and interviews. The 2003 2-disc set includes ""A Christmas Story"" in both pan and scan and letterbox, and the movie is remastered; making it appear just as fantastic as it sounds.If you're like me you will watch ""A Christmas Story"" over and over again during Christmastime because it's the perfect movie to welcome in the most joyous time of the year.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3UZZNTNMNE4NJ	jk	"I give this movie a 5 star rating, simply because I love hearing Ralphie imagining his dreams of what he wants for Christmas, as well as a boy just growing up, doing things I feel little boys anticipated during this time period. One of my favorite parts is where he finally receives his Ovaltine de-coder in the mail... things like this actually did happen back then! Ralphie's father is somewhat self-centered, but when Ralphie gets his BB gun, you really understand how he did care about others, rather than just himself. There's a few language issues, which I wish substitutes could have been used to get the message across - so, I recommend parents viewing the movie first to make sure it's appropriate for your child. I feel many people enjoy this movie, and it just gets better over the years I've watched it... noticing things I missed before. To me, it's a bit exaggerated on some things that make for a good laugh, and the family seems a little ""different"" - but, all in all- it's probably more like the old days than not! Check it out - hopefully, you can write a better review than me!"	5.0	Just a good classic!	2013-12-17	1	1	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AEE42UT3ERITN	"J. Nowicki ""The Boss and  Mrs. B."""	What do the following have in common?A boy named Ralphie and the phrase 'You'll poke your eye out'!A Red Ryder BB Gun and a sexy, black-mesh leg that's a lamp!A Christmas Story Movie Official Table Leg LampA bar soap wielding mother and an expletive shouting father.A pepto-bismol pink Easter bunny suit and a boy who eats like a piggy.You're right! They all add up to A Christmas Story!It is about Ralphie, wonderfully played by Peter Billingsley, who longs for a Red Ryder BB Gun!He repeatedly hears 'You'll poke your eye out' every time he mentions the gun.Darrin McGavin is terrific as the contest entering father who is ecstatic when he finally wins.His prize, a leg-shaped animated lamp complete with a black mesh stocking!In his eyes the leg of lamp (I coudn't resist) is absolutely beautiful and,much to the dismay of his wife, he proudly displays it for all to see in their front window.The lamp is a major source of contention between them as each one attempts to move it.His language when anything goes wrong - from the exploding furnace to the sparking wiringto the neighbors free roaming dogs has reprecussions when, in frustration, Ralphie repeats them.Enter Mom with the soap! Don't worry you won't hear the actual words being said but you will getthe gist of it - or should that be drift, as this is a winter story.Little brother, Randy, is a picky eater and is only successfully coaxed to eat by his mother, played perfectlyby Melinda Dillon, when she has him pretend to eat like his favorite storybook animal, a pig.With his face firmly in the plate he eats like one much to the disgust of his father!Although based on the Red Ryder BB gun, there are many other storylines highlighted in this wonderful movie.There are bullies, school friends, Christmas tree lots, Santa coming to town and the hilarious Christmas giftof a  pink Easter Bunny outfit poor Ralphie has to try on. You will enjoy this movie!It takes place at a time when I was growing up and many of the scenes recall my childhood.To those of us who grew up in the forties and early fifties it brings back fond memories of our past Christmases.We had real trees adorned with tinsel and glowing with big colorful bulbs, no themed trees with just whitelights, our trees glowed with a rainbow of colors. We had favorite radio shows, wore galoshes and hadbackyards with snow covered sheds just like the ones in Ralphie's backyard.All of those are in this film, and as such, A Christmas Story has a wonderful familiarity about it.You can almost smell the heavy scent of pine mixed with the delicious aroma of a roasting turkey.This movie is a classic and will, once again, be eagerly watched by our family.Ah! Memories are made of this!~ Mrs. B. (The Boss agrees!)	5.0	Memories Are Made Of This!	2006-11-16	7	6	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A10ODC971MDHV8	John Farr	"Based on a Jean Shepherd short story, Bob Clark's irresistible, often hilarious 40's-era holiday tale benefits from an immense heart, rich period detail, and quirky comic characters. In certain scenes--such as Ralphie's nightmarish encounter with a department-store Santa and his parents' squabbling over an indecent lamp--Bob Clark moves beyond nostalgia to lampoon the absurdity of the adult world. With note-perfect performances from the whole cast, Clark's ""Christmas Story"" is a latter-day holiday gem brightly wrapped with big laughs."	5.0	A Christmas Story	2007-07-06	1	1	0

Last year I believe a cable station had A Christmas Story Marathon. They just ran the movie over & over & over. The dvd version with commentary might be interesting. Indeed you can have this on in the background while you wrap presents, cook, address cards etc. pausing everytime the wicked witch or Santa Claus  says to Ralphie, ""You'll shoot your eye out."" Lots of touchstones of the time: a ditsy stay at home mom, radio shows, getting your mouth washed out with soap, hunting for the perfect Christmas tree. Darren McGavin is not exactly Ward Cleaver as the gruff, profane, childish but lovable old man. If this movie wasn't already a Christmas classic it could be a cult film."	5.0	A demented Leave it to Beaver...on steroids.	2006-12-21	2	2	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3OH101U0CPUC7	Joseph Boone	"Nine-year-old Ralphie wants nothing in life more than a Red Rider BB gun.  He plots and schemes but no matter where he turns, he is thwarted by the mantra that all adults seem destined to utter, ""You'll shoot your eye out.""  This is a simple story of one family at Christmas time and follows Ralphie as he goes to school, deals with his parents, and keeps fighting to get his BB gun.This movie was virtually invisible when it was originally released, but has since become a holiday classic.  All of us can relate to Ralphie's quest on some level, and many can probably empathize with the parents as well.  The cast was virtually perfect from top to bottom and Peter Billingsley's wide eyed innocence is particularly effective.  The other standout is Darren McGavin with a wonderful performance as the dad that is understated at some times and wildly exaggerated at others... but always striking the right note at just the right time.  The only sour note is kid brother Randy who simply whines and cries throughout the entire movie and adds nothing funny or interesting.A Christmas Story deserves to be enjoyed each year during the Christmas season.  It's a timeless story and captures a little slice of Americana in a unique and charming way.  It is shown regularly on TV, but is much more enjoyable when watched uninterrupted and unedited from the DVD."	4.0	A Christmas Classic	2007-12-14	1	1	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AVR3F6VQYIMZW	Joseph Tidline	"I remember the first time I saw A Christmas Story. It was the holiday season of 1985 and I saw it on cable. Little did I know then how much of a lasting effect this film would have on me. From that point on I have watched A Christmas Story every holiday season. It has become a holiday tradition in my household and we watch it every year at least once. I have seen it countless times and still never tire of watching it. In fact I find myself saying many of the lines along with the film. A Christmas Story has become a christmas classic and it is a well deserved title. This movie makes me laugh and in a few scenes makes me cry but I never grow tired of watching this great film. And in the future I look forward to showing this film to my own kids so they too can experience this classic holiday film. ANd I was ecstatic when they finally released a 2 disc version of this film packed with extras. I used to own the orignal one disc release and it was bare bones with nothing on the disc but the film itself and it was in fullscreen. So finally this film has gotten the proper presentation it so deserves. I hope that this film becomes a part of your holiday tradition as it has been a part of mine for all these years.""You'll shoot your eye out!"""	5.0	A Christmas tradition for over 20 years	2005-09-17	9	8	1

Yeah, we identify with all the stuff in this movie, but so what?  The truth is that none of this movie is remotely funny.  It's not one of those ""so stupid it's funny"" movies.  It's just a movie that's so stupid you'll wonder what you're torturing yourself with it.  I cannot say anything good about this movie.  It's...just...bad!  Over acted.  Over played.  Overly stupid.

Simply told, well acted, written to express the life moments that are relevant in every child's life; we have all had an &#34;Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle!&#34; that we, as a child, obsessed over. While that is the main thread of the movie, it's in the side stories of the relationships with parents, teachers, siblings, bullies and friends that makes this such a memorable and universal tale.	5.0	One of the most awesome stories of life...	2013-10-27	0	0	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1457U3OWNOJTB	Julie Bristol-Evans (bristol-evans@iname.com)	I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and I knew immediately that I wanted to own it on video.  It has so many things that make it a great movie. There is the main character, Ralphie, with his  boyhood dreams of getting the &quot;bad guys&quot; with a Red Ryder BB gun;  the mom who has the right mix of zaniness and motherly compassion; and  Darren McGaven is great as the dad with all kinds of eccentricities, but in  the end comes through for Ralphie.  The family is great, and the little  vignettes are hilarious.  I especially liked how they went to a Chinese  restaurant for Christmas dinner, and the rules of how to dare a friend to  stick his tongue to a frozen flag pole. This movie has so much charm,  humor, and innocent sweetness that it has become one of our family  traditions, along with Charlie Brown, the Grinch, and George Bailey.	5.0	A little boy's Christmas fantasy comes true.	1998-12-15	0	0	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2F75U0YYXFO91	"Justin R. Cicconi ""MST junkie"""	This movie is grossly overrated by the public and critics alike. It concerns a whiny little kid in the 40's or 50's who wants a bb gun for christmas. The protagonist the kid is a simpering and annoying brat and the rest of the charactars are equally displeasing. People have said it reminds them of their childhoods which is okay with me but I cetainly do not consider this movie a classic by any means. From the profanity, and the beating of a child, (over the phone,thankfully) to the nasty depiction of Santa, the flagpole kid and the protagonist beating up another child this film is a lame, unfunny excuse for a christmas film. Avoid. Recommondations instead: Miracle on 34th street, It's a wonderful life, a christmas carol, a muppet christmas movie, the garfield or charlie brown christmas specials a flintstone christmas carol, the santa clause, prancer, and just about any other christmas movie.	1.0	Egad!

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AFJAAPYUZZ9TS	"Kat B. ""mystery addict"""	This is a fantastic Christmas movie. I think anyone of any age would enjoy this film. It's based on a story by Jean Shepard, who was a fantastic humorist in numerous forms. Everything I've ever seen or heard that was based on his writings has been thoroughly enjoyable. His writings, and this film in particular, give insight into a time when many of us weren't yet born. And a sweet time it was. :)	5.0	Doesn't everybody know this one?	2014-01-27	0	0	0

My sister and I were born and raised in Hammond, Indiana (Shepherd's hometown which he calls ""Hohman"" in the story), and though it wasn't filmed there, Shepherd captures the essence of the scruffy old steel town.  But more than that, it's a great piece of nostalgia.  My dad loves it because it reminds him of his own childhood in the 1930's--grumpy father, sooty furnace and all.  Everyone will love it because it is a funny take on the American Christmas hullaballoo.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AEGLF0F0I36QW	kcstrawberryblonde	"Loved it! My favorite Christmas movie.Hilarious from beginning to end.Happy,upbeat feeling throughout.A lot of vintage things.If you're a baby boomer you might relate to the Christmas tree that's a real cedar tree,the long strands of silver tinsel that used to come in rectangular boxes,and the big Christmas lights.That and the father's ongoing war with his coal furnace.I strongly recommend ""A Christmas Story"" for anyone of any faith,or none,and anyone of any age.It's rated PG.When Ralphie says ""The mother of all dirty words"" you don't technically hear him say it.It's great fun about a real family. The whole movie is syrup-free.There's no pushing any religion,no trying to sell the idea that everyone else has a Hallmark Christmas, no rubbing peoples' noses in it if they don't have a perfect family and house,OR if they aren't getting engaged to a prince or princess on Christmas.It does,however have snow,Christmas lights,vintage toys,and much about what it's like being a child at Christmas.If you were lucky enough to have had some good winter holidays,as a child,this movie takes you right back and puts you in the situation again.It all comes back to you.If your childhood holidays left you with not-good memories then,as the saying goes,""It's never too late to have a happy childhood.""This movie will finally put you in the situation of having a happy childhood at Christmastime.I think you'll like it."	5.0	Hilarious,happy,realistic.No sappiness here.	2012-11-03	2	1	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1HJLC3H2TNODQ	Keith	This is quite possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen.  My holiday season officially begins the first time I watch &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;.  The movie features wondefully comedic writing, especially in  the very effective narrative framework as Peter Billingsley's character  &quot;Ralphie&quot;, now grown, describes the events and characters leading  up to the Christmas he receives his first Red Ryder BB Gun, the highlight  of his young life.  Darren McGavin is hilarious as Ralphie's dad, and  everytime I see &quot;Kenny&quot; on &quot;South Park&quot; I think of the  little brother all bundled up in his snowsuit and parka trying to keep up  with the big boys.  It's a wonderful family movie.  Anyone who watches it  can see a piece of their own childhood in the film--the Bumpas' dogs, the  bully Scott Farkas, the admonition that a toy will &quot;shoot your eye  out.&quot;  It's beautiful.  Watch, rent, buy this movie.  You won't regret  it.  And don't take any triple dog dares involving flag poles!	5.0	&quot;A Christmas Story&quot;	1999-11-30	18	17	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A4BZYE4N90ECU	"Kenton Fan ""mike_weir"""	Hands down, the best of em all.  Though the film, according to director Bob Clark, is set in 1940, it might as well be &quot;any year&quot; since this film captures the magic, anticipation, elation, and madness that Xmas creates in the heart of a child to a tee regardless of the decade.  Everyone can remember the quest for that one special toy...the plotting, the planning, the wishing, the whining, the begging,...did I mention the WHINING?  Its all here but wrapped in a film with just the perfect blend of heart and hilarity.If you haven't seen it, where have you been?!  TNT has the run the film continuously for 24 hours on Xmas eve for the last two Christmas seasons!I loved this DVD set, it was great seeing Peter Billingsly all grown up (though he is not near as animated as he was 20 years ago :) and it was fun listening to the commentary.  My only critisism would be that there were not enough &quot;inside&quot; shot by shot anecdotes.  But Bob Clark didn't seem to recall enough and Peter Billingsly was a kid when he shot the film.  But no matter, this DVD is a must have next Xmas season.	5.0	The Greatest Christmas Movie Ever!	2003-12-30	7	6	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2113JMF0FI5YL	Kevin Freeman	"Well, I saw this movie some time ago when it was still in the theaters.  The other kids I watched it with agreed with me at the time that the movie was kind of weird and we shouldn't have let our parents choose the flick we saw at the cineplex.So now Christmas Story has some nostalgia/retro thing going on, and we get all these rave reviews.  Here's why I don't quite understand:First we've got that godawful ""Kevin Arnold"" voiceover from the main character.  Somebody write Hollywood and tell them to give that ""storytelling"" technique a rest.  Most of the other characters are ""broadly"" played, so we're never sure if we're watching a slice of life movie or a farce.BB guns are beloved by many kids of my generation, but we all knew they could hurt us (and others), and the anxieties about bodily harm were real and not something you would generally try to play for laughs.  ""Put your eye out"".  What a knee-slapper!Moving right along, we get the ""creep out"" extended joke about the ""fishnet thigh"" lamp.  This tasteless item is now available by mail order, in case you want one of these hideous things in your home.  Meanwhile, some kid gets his tongue stuck while licking a pole in freezing weather, Ralphie has to wear bunny pajamas, and visitors to Santa leave via a giant slide (what were the writers smoking?).  Towards the end, there's something about dogs getting in the kitchen and ruining the turkey, so the family goes out for Christmas dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where the staff removes the cooked goose's head because the father says ""it's smiling at us"".My guess is that a number of parents rent this movie over the holidays on account of the word-of-mouth marketing by its little cult following.  When they realize how strange and humorless the film is, they just keep quiet.  There are probably very few ""repeat"" renters, but every Xmas season, a few people take the same chance.  This might be why the film remains popular as a ""holiday classic""."	2.0	I just don't get it	2004-12-23	52	4	48

And unlike most movies you see over and over as a kid, I found myself loving this movie the older I got. It's a testament to all involved with this movie that I, and everyone I've talked to, feel this way. My holidays aren't complete without revisiting Ralphie and his slightly eccentric family. I still die laughing when Ralphie's oblivious mother asks where he learned to curse, and calls up his friends house instigating a beating. And when the &quot;leg lamp&quot; arrives marked fraa-gee-lay(it's french), and Ralphie's mother does everything to avoid putting it up.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A27H9DOUGY9FOS	"K. Harris ""Film aficionado"""	"I recently had the inauspicious pleasure of viewing ""The Polar Express"" for the first time, and it made me think about some of my favorite holiday films.  ""Express"" has been championed from its inception as an INSTANT CHRISTMAS CLASSIC.  Well, I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  The film, for all its technical merit, goes through the motions rather routinely serving up obvious heapings of message after heartwarming message.  It lacks a subtlety and restraint that I, for one, would have appreciated.  (And I apologize if you loved ""Express"" as most do, it's just not for me.)  But the bigger question for me was--""Can a film be an instant classic?""  To my mind, the answer is no--a classic evolves.The phenomena of a regular film evolving into a classic is rather indefinable, but very exciting in hindsight.  A premiere example is ""A Christmas Story.""  Released in 1983, ""Story"" dropped into theaters with little fanfare and even smaller box office success.  A wistful and nostalgic look at the childhood of humorist Jean Shepherd, the film recounts, in hilarious detail, one child's quest for the ultimate Christmas gift.  As a metaphor for happiness itself, a Red Ryder BB Gun is all Ralphie desires for the upcoming holiday.  Using fantasy sequences and over-the-top comic portrayals, this film still manages to be grounded in reality.  For the film understands how kids think, how parents react, and has such warmth and joy at its foundation.  The small town Americana of a bygone era is lovingly recreated, and the film hearkens back to an innocent time where the worst that could happen was a run-in with a town bully or perhaps ""shooting your eye out"" with a new BB gun.The screenplay is so rich and funny, I know people who can quote whole passages from this film.  And there's lots of great material to work with!  The performances are spot on.  Peter Billingsly is fantastic as Ralphie--and even today, he is identified with this iconic role.  Melinda Dillon is perfect as the sweet, put-upon mother.  But who can forget Darrin McGavin, in an uncharacteristic comedic performance, as Ralphie's dad?  It is a perfectly nuanced performance--gruff and hard on the exterior, but succumbing to a childlike wonderment of his own at winning a ""major prize.""""A Christmas Story"" is sweet without being cloying, carries a message without being obvious, and is suitable for the whole family without ""dumbing itself down"" for children.  And for these reasons, people started discovering ""Story"" through the years--on cable, on VHS, and now on DVD.  One Cable TV station has even broadcast it for 24 hours straight on Christmas Eve for the last several years.  If this isn't a testament to ""A Christmas Story""'s enduring appeal, I don't know what is.  Now a bona fide Christmas Classic--no one had to proclaim it or convince people of its merit.  People have decided for themselves.  And for anyone who thought I lacked Christmas spirit for daring to question ""The Polar Express""--here it is.  I reserved it for a movie that has earned my love and respect, not one that demanded it.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3AP6H48QHX8BR	"Kimberly M. ""Kimberly"""	"I LOVE this Christmas movie and in my opinon it's probably one of the best movies ever made in the United States. Based upon the life and real-true story of Jean Shepard the movie takes place when a young boy Ralphie wants a coveted Red Ryder B.B. gun but his mother tells him ""no you'll shoot your eye out."" So, all his Christmas hopes are dashed... but, not giving up Ralphie deals with some hillarous incidents in dealings with bullies, teachers, and even a store Santa to get the toy of his dreams.This will remain to be a classic in American homes for generations to come. Kids will love the movie for they can relate to that ""gotta have toy"" feeling and adults will remember what it was like- to be a child around Christmas or what their FAVORITE Christmas was like.Written very well this smart witted comedy gets laughs no matter how many times you watch it. Jean Sheppard's voiceovers as the Older Ralphie fit in perfectly with the younger Ralphie's antics.This movie will bring a smile to any kid or adults face and is the perfect Christmas present or DVD to watch around Christmas.

Any time I break down and finally buy a DVD of a favorite film which seems to refuse to break into special edition form, within 12 months, it happens.  I did this with Holy Grail, Evil Dead 2, and Wallace and Gromit.As I view it now, I find this edition to be very viewable.  It looks better than it does on TV every year.  It is clear and I see no compression artifacts.  Sound is fine, although monaural.  I would like to see it widescreen, fully restored, with commentary or retrospective interviews.  It surprises me to know that the original laserdisc presentation was, in widescreen (1.66:1).  Why they didn't carry this over to the DVD is beyond me.As others have written, I give this movie 5 stars and the presentation drags it, kicking and screaming, to 3.

A christmas story is about, surprise, surprise, a christmas for your all-american family. One of the members of the family, a golden-haired  little boy named Ralphie, wishes for a &quot;Red Ryder BB gun&quot; for  christmas, more than anything. But, to his dismay, he is told again and  again by all the adults in his life that he can't have one, 'cause he'll  &quot;shoot his eye out&quot;.This movie is about what Ralphie does in  an attempt to get his coveted gun... and the results are hilarious! Thrown  into the mix for good measure is a crush on a school teacher, a  tounge-stuck-to-a-frozen-pole, and numerous attacks by the thuggish town  bully. I finished this movie feeling like a nine-year-old again.	5.0	Downright funny	2000-01-19	2	2	0
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1U6B2LDK3BUVU	"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are..."	There are some strengths to this movie.  The marriage we get to witness is a terrific one.  The father and mother love each other and the children.  It is not a wealthy family.  It is an average family.  I can't believe that one of the reviewers on this site complained that the family was grimy.  That is one of the few strengths of this film, that the family is ordinary rather than wealthy and proper.My favorite moment of the movie is when Santa Claus gives the little boy a kick.  It's the only real laugh in the film.As for the rest of it, it's a children's film, and if you like that sort of thing, you will like this.The bullying that takes place in the movie is disturbing.  I don't see any humor in it.  Bullying is no joke.  I was glad to see that the little boy gave the bully hell, eventually.  But it really isn't the kind of subject to make light of, and this movie does make light of it.  Oh well, haha, a neighborhood bully is tormenting the kids again, no big deal.To sum up, I like the love in this ordinary family, and for a kids movie it isn't too bad.	2.0	Nice kick, Santa	2005-06-25	21	3	18

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2MNB77YGJ3CN0	L. Mountford	Think back to those Christmases from your childhood ... Isn't there one that stands out in your memory as the &quot;Christmas to end all Christmases&quot;?  You wanted a particular toy more than anything, more than life itself.  You did everything in your power to ensure its delivery, behaving in your most responsible mature way, making sure Santa knew about it (you had your doubts about Santa, but you wanted to hedge your bets).Such is the premise for &quot;A Christmas Story.&quot;  Peter Billingsley as Ralphie gives a sterling performance, a perfect combination of childhood naivete' and more mature observation.  Darrin McGavin is wonderful as Ralphie's dad, &quot;the old man,&quot; exuding boyish joy while at the same time trying to act like a &quot;father.&quot;  The only casting choice that I questioned was Melinda Dillon as Ralphie's mother -- she does a fine job, though, and in the end is a nice match for Darrin McGavin.The story is narrated by Jean Shepherd himself, in a sort of midwest-accented Tom Bodette or Garrison Keillor style.  It works beautifully, lending a sort of sepia-toned nostalgic tone to the story.If you're looking for a replacement (or addition) to &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; this is a good candidate.  It's funnier (the Bumpus's worthless pack of bloodhounds almost steal the show a couple of times), and (I feel) more realistic -- something the entire family can enjoy!	5.0	My favorite Christmas movie . . .	2001-12-06	3	3	0
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2NLIB986TEESZ	L. M Young	I grew up 20 years later than Ralphie and Randy, yet still remember all those wonderful things at Christmastime: a big department store with Santaland and an expanded toy department, a downtown Christmas parade, going out to get the tree from a tree lot, Bing Crosby playing on the phonograph, plus Dad being gruff and a bit contentious, Mom a worrier but understanding just when you needed her. Oh, I had TV instead of radio, our furnace was oil instead of coal, and the toys and cars were a bit different, but A Christmas Story wrapped up all my memories in a hilarious package. The new DVD is terrific: a great picture in widescreen, Jean Shepherd reading the original stories that inspired situations in the film, seeing Peter Billingsly and the other kids twenty years later.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"How do movies become classics?  I am clueless to answer.  I do not remember seeing ""A Christmas Story"" advertised in 1983.  This movie did very poorly in theaters.  Perhaps this low-budget film suffered from lack of support.  The movie does not compare with typical Christmas movie releases that emphasize mega-budgets and big-name stars.  Maybe we were all looking in the wrong place for entertainment.The movie is based on the late Jean Shepherd's book, ""In God We Trust, All Other's Pay Cash.""  Jean Shepherd also narrates this marvelous movie, as well as appearing in the film.  Jean's narration is wonderful and really helps to make this movie successful.  The story is inspired by real life events (even if they did not happen to Jean, they happened to others - trust me on this).  Jean managed to capture the feel of Christmas in the Midwest in the post-World War II era.  Actually, the Midwest had this feel into the 1950's and 1960's.  I recall myself asking for a BB gun in the 1960's and the answer was - yep, you guessed it - you'll shoot your eye out!The Midwest has always been a peculiar place when compared with the coasts.  While the Midwest is just as advanced as either coast, it somehow feels more nostalgic and archaic.  In some small towns, like the fictional Hohman, Indiana, entering town feels like stepping back several decades.  The display windows of stores were a big deal in past decades, from coast to coast.  Toy trains were often a feature of window displays.  The display in Higbee's (which was a real chain of stores in Ohio) was a classic store display.  I admit that I fail to recall the kind of store Santa that Higbee's had.  The Santa's that I visited in the past had fancy chairs, but they were on the ground.The bully was nicely played in this movie.  As Jean Shepherd noted after the incident between Ralphie and Farkus, once you stood up to the bullies they often stopped bothering you.  I guess it was only fun being a bully when the smaller kids ran away.Ralphie and the broken glasses is also classic.  Glasses were expensive and parent continually advised their children to take care of them.  Ralphie had to think fast after accidentally crunching his glasses.  If Ralphie had revealed that he stepped on his glasses after they fell off because of a ricocheting BB, his parents would like have confiscated his BB gun until he turned 50, or maybe older.The list of events in this movie that defines an era is lengthy.  As I noted before, while the specific incidents may not have been true, they were inspired by actual events.  Jean Shepherd did a phenomenal job of capturing the essence of a region and an era.  Jean clearly loved his childhood in the Midwest, his parents and had a strong nostalgia for an era that is rapidly fading into the distant past.Does the movie have a ""message,"" which one reviewer suggested the movie does not?  This movie has lots of messages.  Note Ralphies' reaction to his Little Orphan Annie decoder; Message:  It's a crummy commercial.  Ralphies' first experience with his Red Ryder BB gun; Message:  Your parent's may actually know what they are talking about and you should take greater care in following their advice.  Ralphie and the bullies; Message:  Sometimes you need to stop letting bullies push you around.  Okay, enough messages.  This movie is filled with messages.  If you failed to find one, you were looking somewhere else - like your navel, or a picture book.Though there is minimal significance to awards for a movie like this, this movie obtained nominations for thirteen awards of various types, and it won two.  Good job!""A Christmas Story"" may only be a great family Christmas movie for a while.  That ""while"" may only be as long as there are enough of us that remember the 1940's, the 1950's and the early 1960's.  Until then, I plan to watch this movie again and again.Enjoy!"	5.0	A Modern Family Christmas Classic	2006-12-26	16	16	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	ATHTCOG6BB6WK	L. Williams	This story of Ralphie and his longing for a specific Christmas present is one of the best movies ever in my book. I've watched it so many times by now that several lines from the movie have become a part of the fabric of every day events. For instance, I think of Ralphie if I'm waiting in a long line that is backed up to Terre Haute, and of course any time I see Santa at a shopping center I'm reminded of Ho-Ho-Ho.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3U7X9WM653YPS	"Mama Kimmberli ""Mama Kimmberli"""	The people that have rated this movie less than 5 stars apparently take themselves too seriously and/or live in an idealistic fantasy world.  Face it people, Ralphie IS an everyday kid who swears and wants a gun and fantasizes about misadventures with bad guys and fights with his little brother.  And THAT'S what makes this movie so doggone special!!!I love the whole thing.  I think it's genious.  I think that Peter Billingsley plays the part of Ralphie to perfection.  He is believeable as the slightly nerdy, slightly average boy who enrolls in the Little Orphan Annie Secret Society decades before that would have been considered majorly &quot;uncool&quot;.  And when the family fights over who's gonna be Santa, rips into the Christmas presents in their jammies and then share wine while looking at the tattered wrapping paper...well, it takes me back to my OWN childhood, which I feel blessed was very special and endearing (yet far from perfect).  However, I'm a student nurse and fairly well-adjusted, so I'd like to think that my parents did a dandy job.  And when Ralphie's dad surprises him with the gun....that scene is priceless because COUNTLESS other children have been suprised by their fun-loving dads and the magic of Santa, too.  And it takes THEM back.A Christmas Story is a wonderful film for the WHOLE family.  People, life is NOT perfect.  Get over yourselves.  Have fun and grab yourselves a heavily spiked egg nog before laughing yourself silly...especially if this is the first time you've seen this Christmas gem that will forever be my favorite holiday film.	5.0	Get a grip..this movie is GREAT!!!	2003-11-14	6	4	2

I've watched this movie over and over and over again...every year at Christmas and it never gets old. As a matter of fact, when watching it again this year at Christmas (2009), I spotted something that I've never noticed before. Seems to be that way ever year, which helps to keep it fresh and entertaining. Movie is not a small child movie, but definitely made for teens and adults. Highly recommend purchasing it.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A28NDN4NOBKNHM	Maria Williams	Despite the controversy over Jamie's provocative negative review, I happen to agree with him/her. While some parts of the movie were humorous I must admit, the movie as a whole was dark and mean. Swearing is glorified, as well as the violence. I watched through this movie before allowing my kids to see it, and I decided this was not a movie to let them see at their age. This movie does have it's followers, but you must see that this film is not one that young children should be seeing. Santa Claus is also portrayed as sinister, which kids will not understand and could be potentially traumatizing. I'm afraid to say that I did not like this movie. I do not believe that it should be considered a classic like Miracle on 34th Street. If anything, it should be a time waster for older, more mature teens. I'm sorry if I offended loyal fans of this movie, but that's what I think.	2.0	Not a good movie to let the kids watch...	2000-12-05	41	5	36

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	It's 1940's Indiana, and all Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB Gun.  He knows he needs to drop subtle hints to his parents (Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon).  But when his mother expresses concern that it might not be safe, he has to develop some back up plans.Meanwhile, there is plenty else going on in the family.  Ralphie has to face the neighborhood bully to defend his brother Randy (Ian Petrella).  His father wins a hideous lamp.  And Ralphie finally gets his Little Orphan Annie decoder.  But through it all, Ralphie plots and schemes to get his BB gun.  Will it be under the tree Christmas morning?This movie is based on a collection of short stories, and it shows.  While the multiple stories weave in and out of each other much like real life, they never truly form a cohesive whole.  And ultimately, that's my problem with the film.  It felt uneven to me.  There were several laughs along the way, and the acting was good.  But the movie seemed to be wandering with little focus, and that proved to be too much of a distraction.I'm sure if I had grown up with this film, I'd feel differently about it because this isn't a bad film.  But it isn't one that I will add to my Christmas traditions.	3.0	Watch Ralphie Shoot His Eye Out	2008-01-09	2	1	1

I prefer the widescreen myself (though you can watch the full screen version just to see the trampoline that Black Bart uses to jump the fence and mount his horse as he flees the imagined wrath of Ralphie's blue-steel beauty - the trampoline isn't visible in the WS version).This CE also contains a set of Leg Lamp lights to hang on your Xmas tree.Highly recommended."	5.0	The BEST Christmas Movie, EVER!!!	2013-03-11	0	0	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3CCWXKOGPQE58	"Mary M. ""Grandma"""	"My family and I have watched this movie every Christmas. The film and story is beautiful. The story of young Ralphie during 1940's Christmas. To be played in a 24 hour marathon on TBS is a little excessive but it gives us a chance to watch the movie as a backdrop to Christmas parties. The dvd has some nice editions to it. The special features are fun.My 83 year old father remembers a lot of this movies references; i.e. the Red Ryder BB gun (his mother wouldn't let him have one for the same reasons as Ralphie), the Lone Ranger, Little Orphan Annie radio show, and Ovaltine.I like this movie because it's a family theme story. Ralphie and his family's ups and downs during Christmas kind of reminds of my family. Ralphie's friends are familiar to the kids I knew at that age. The triple-dog dares were big at my mom's age, grandparents and myself. The ""profanity"" is both funny and reminder to all the names my sister and I said (""ass-tronaut,"" ""h e double hockey sticks"" and of course ""fudge"").This is a true classic Christmas movie that will always be a tradition to be watched in my family."	5.0	Christmas Tradition	2013-01-04	1	1	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3G7BIWDMF9KDH	Matthew Patton	I went to see this movie because CROSS CREEK, which was supposed to be the big holiday movie of 1983, was sold out.  I finally ran into CROSS CREEK on television a few years ago.  The photography was very nice.Actually, the  photography in this film is quite nice as well.  But the reason I remember  the film is the way that it takes the basic stuff of childhood (the  viciousness of your best friends, the intrinsic annoying-ness of you  siblings, the trench warfare that parents and chilren and husbands and  wives wage on a daily basis) and tweaks it just enough to make it funny.  There isn't a plot as such--little Ralphie Parker dreams of getting a Red  Ryder BB-gun for Christmas, and this is the thread on which Bob Clark (who  also directed) and Jean Shepherd (on whose novel IN GOD WE TRUST--ALL  OTHERS PAY CASH the film is based) string a series of vignettes about  Ralphie's friends and family, from poor Flick getting his tongue stuck to a  frozen pole to Mom &quot;accidentally&quot; breaking the woman's-leg lamp  that Dad won in a contents and insists on displaying in the front window.  The film is also helped by the pitch-perfect casting; Darren McGavin as The  Old Man, all raging, frustrated id, Melinda Dillon as Mother, a sweet,  rational woman in general, but given to moments of eccentric outrage, and  Peter Billingsly as Ralphie--a marvelous combination of unaffected  youthfulness and shrewd comic timing (you can believe that this kid would  grow up to be somebody smart like Jean Shepherd).And best of all,  despite the wonderful period details in the sets and costumes, this isn't a  nostalgic film; the script and the performances always cut the sugar with  plenty of vinegar--which makes the whole thing that much tastier . . .	5.0	Too funny to be nostalgic	1999-12-25	7	6	1
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A17TPT3FWAE5T1	"Matthew Spady ""800rsd"""	This movie remains so fresh with each viewing, it is easy to forget that it is almost twenty years old.  Told from Ralphie's viewpoint, these are the Christmas reminiscences of an adult whose pre-teen Christmas wish is a BB-gun that adults discouraged with the phrase &quot;You'll shoot your eye out.&quot;In his quest to convince his parents that he is old enough to have a BB-gun, young Ralphie hatches several plots, including writing the best &quot;What I Want for Christmas&quot; essay in his class, being leaving BB-gun ads in conspicuous places, and, as a last resort, asking Santa Claus. (Parents with young sons, beware: you may want to delay purchasing this film until you are ready to deal with a similar request.)Told in episodic fashion, there are many vignettes which stand out: Ralphie wearing Aunt Martha's Christmas present, visiting Santa Claus and helping his father change a flat-tire come to mind immediately.  Exaggerated acting, distorted camera angles, and day-dream sequences all enhance the child's viewpoint, but do not detract from the film's excellent portrayal of 1950's small-town Christmas ritual.Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin have a tongue-in-cheek style as Ralphie's parents.  Peter Billingsley has just the right pre-teen balance between adorable and obnoxious, and Ian Petrella is downright irritating as baby brother Randy.  Among the smaller roles, Zack Ward is perfect as the clay-footed bully and Tedde Moore excellent as Ralphie's kind, but practical teacher.  (Jean Shepherd, the author and narrator of the film makes a cameo appearance standing in line, waiting for Santa.)This is one to enjoy each Christmas.	5.0	Excellent, funny, well-done film	2001-12-11	63	54	9
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A30HZ6S9V8D18X	Matthew T Scott	I saw this as a teenager in the theaters on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised; it has become a family tradition ever since we got it on video many years later.  Based on the works of Jean Shepard, it is very faithful to the source material (he even narrates) - even if some of the stories are not originally related to Christmas (the Bumpkiss hounds actually eat the Easter ham in Shepard's book) but as a whole the collected stories are believable, poignant, and funny.Of course, EVERYONE has seen this by now, so you know what I'm talking about.  If you're one of the 15 or so people in America who haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and correct that as soon as you can.  Also, look into getting your hands on Jean Shepard's books as well - also highly enjoyable and recommended.	4.0	An absolute classic	2014-01-03	0	0	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2HETON1ZLNW1A	mattyp4	"I won't even bother reviewing the film itself: it's a modern classic & everyone who is reading this has probably seen it a few dozen times.  What I will review are the extras to this 20th anniversary 2-disc special edition.You'd think after twenty years the producers would have a boat-load of extras to offer.  If not that then a large assortment of cast & crew members onhand to create an interesting retrospective documentary.What we get instead is a 20 minute reflection by a few of the cast members (the now grown up actors who portrayed Ralphie, Schwartz, Flick, & Scott Farkus, as well as director Bob ""Porky's"" Clark) called Another Christmas Story that seemed to have been thrown together in one afternoon.  Where's Melinda Dillon?  Where's Darren McGavin?  And where's the kid who played Randy (who, might I add, looks NOTHING like he did in 1983.  I saw a photo of him somewhere & he looks disheveled & totally washed up).  This ""reflection"" just features the five guys rattling off a few ordinary memories of their experience (They didn't think it was going to be a huge success [who ever does?]; The kids played pranks while they stayed in a hotel; etc.  Wow.  The insights are killing me).  It's not really informative.  Nor is it fun to watch.Although I want to point out that Scottie Schwartz- porn star extraordinaire- looks creepily the same as he did in 1983.  He's just pudgier & has a goatee.  And Zack ""Scott Farkus"" Ward (who you'll recognize from TV's recent Titus) is incredibly obnoxious.  He's constantly hamming it up, which seems to be encouraged by the not-at-all-funny Pop-Up Video style production features.  Yeech.The PG-commentary (by actor Peter Billingsley & director/writer Bob Clark) fares a little better.  Not the best commentary ever recorded, but it gives the film a fresh viewing (I must have seen the film like, 700 times).The rest of this special edition's features go way downhill:  There's the Triple Dog Dare trivia game (which features the above mentioned interview participants reading the questions... clearly taped right after giving the interview); Radio readings by author Jean Sheppard, which are interesting, but a tad on the long [read: tedious] side; a stupid decoder game (does anyone really needs this?); etc.  It's your typical DVD special edition filler [...].The most annoying extra (besides Zack Ward's testimonials) is the featurette on the company that makes the leg lamps.  The ""correspondent"" (I forget his name) gives his worst Daily Show knock-off in what is perhaps the most embarrassing and unfunny segment my eyeballs have witnessed.  This has to be seen to be believed.  Though you'll want your 3 minutes back immediately after viewing it.I still recommend getting this DVD over the other standard version.  The packaging is nice.  The film is naturally classic.  The commentary is vaguely interesting.  But the extras are weak... really weak... and had so much potential."	4.0	Warner Home Video Gave Us Some Coal In Our Stockings...	2003-12-24	17	14	3

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AZWX8YF8K2DB	"""maxnikka"""	"I just compared the letterboxed laserdisc version of this film to the dvd full screen version of this film. The laserdisc version does nothing more than add black bars to the top and bottom of what you see on the dvd version. In other words...the top and bottom parts of the film are cut out on the laserdisc version. I noticed this with the dvd letterbox and full screen laserdisc version of ""When Harry Met Sally."" It appears you are actually not missing any part of the picture on this dvd version of this movie. I just completed a side-by-side comparison ofboth versions and this is what I ended up with. So...go ahead and buy this version and you'll be just fine. You needn't worry about missing any part of the film as far as the original theatrical aspect of this film is concerned.  A handful of film directors do this (James Cameron has done this with ""The Abyss"") because they are aware the film will eventually end up on television, so they will shoot the film as if shooting for a television release.  When the film is first released in theaters they simply add black bars to the top and bottom of the film to make it appear widescreen.  When it plays on tv the black bars are simply removed and you get the full screen version with none of the picture removed thus eliminating the necessity for pan-and-scanning; you actually get more picture information then the theatrical release."	5.0	It appears film aspect of this dvd is fine.	2002-03-03	4	3	1

And being from a child's point of view, why it is precious!  It never failed, whatever I wanted my parents, teachers, etc, etc, etc thought  it was unnecessary or just plain out dangerous.The first time I saw this  movie, I was skeptical.  My mother told me I'd love it and anytime she  tells me that, I usually squirm away in horror.  But she was right!  This  movie makes me belly laugh about so many things!  And Flick... What a  dunderhead!  Who'd put his tongue on a frozen flagpole!I love the  whole movie down to the Bumpass's dogs and the stolen Turkey episode to the  &quot;Butterfinger&quot; to the gruesome Santa!

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"The 1983 film, ""A Christmas Story"", quickly became a holiday classic as viewers fell in love with its witty prose as narrated by Jean Shepherd (1921-1999), who wrote the novel upon which the film is based: ""In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash"".The film begins weeks before Christmas in the city of Terre Haute, Indiana circa 1934.  A young Ralph 'Ralphie' Parker (Peter Billingsley) stares through the glass of a storefront window at the local department store to see what he wants most for Christmas, a Red Rider Be-Be Gun, and ponders the quandary of how to convince his parents to buy him one.  He leaves various clues in the house for his parents to find about how wonderful and necessary the be-be gun is, but when his mother (Melinda Dillon, who received Oscas nominations for her roles in the 1977 film ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and the 1981 film ""Absence of Malice"") asks him what he wants for Christmas during breakfast one morning, Ralphie excitedly blurts out, ""I want an official, Red Ryder, Carbine-action, 200-Shot, Range Model, Air Rifle"".  His mother responds, ""No, that's too dangerous. You'll shoot your eye out.""  Ralphie is crushed at hearing the common adult ""prejudice"" against the be-be gun, but decides upon finding another tactical means of persuasion.At school, Ralphie's teacher, Miss Shields, (Tedde Moore) assigns his class to write a Christmas theme. Most of the students are not happy with the assignment, but Ralphie sees this as another golden opportunity to bolster the superiority of the Red Rider be-be gun as the ideal Christmas gift.  He writes what he believes will be regarded a masterpiece, but when Miss Shields returns his theme, Ralphie is shocked to see a grade of ""C+"". To add insult to injury, Miss Shields writes in red ink, ""You'll shoot your eye out!""  For Ralphie, the universe is coming apart at the seams and it leads to one of the film's many subplots: a fight with the bully Scut Farcus (Zach Ward).  Throughout the first half of the film, Ralphie, his younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella) and his two friends Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R.D. Robb) are terrorized by Scut Farcus and his toady Grover Dill (Yano Anaya).  Upon receiving a C+ for his prized theme, Ralphie's rage empowers him to mercilessly beat upon the unexpecting Scut Farcus and to express his Red Rider frustration in a torrent of obscenities (don't worry, they're unintelligible).  Fearing a severe punishment from his father (Darren McGavin, well-known for his characterization of Carl Kolchak in the 1972 TV-series ""The Night Stalker""), Ralphie & Randy tearfully wait for their father to return home from work; but their mother plays down the fight in a conversation with him to Ralphie's relief.Ralphie's father is a fascinating character in the film with several great subplots: his unintelligible expressions of frustration with the neighbor's uncontrolled pack of dogs and struggles with their failing furnace, and his winning of a ""major prize"".  Ralphie's mother isn't too thrilled with her husband's ""major prize"" since it is a tall plastic lamp in the shape of a woman's leg wearing a black-lace stocking that he proudly displays in front of their livingroom window; but a mysterious and unexplained accident changes the sitation.Other subplots in the film include Ralphie's ""Little Orphan Annie Secret Society Decoder Ring"", Ralphie assiting his father change a flat tire with unforeseen consequences, Schwartz challenging Flick to stick his tongue to a frozen flagpole to see whether it will get stuck, the discovery of Chinese turkey and the frequent overheating of inadequate electrical fuses and outlets in the Parker's home.Jean Shepherd's narration throughout the film binds all of the many subplots into a coherent whole that continues to delight viewers of all ages to its timeless humor and realism.  Though the film itself gets 5 stars, DVD quality is far less than it what it could have been, as other reveiwers have remarked.  The DVD is full-screen instead of widescreen and there is little bonus material offered.  I highly recommend to Warner Studios that this film be digitally remastered in widescreen format and include additional bonus material, such as a biography of Jean Shepherd.Though the DVD quality is low for ""A Christmas Story"", the film itself is well worth the purchase of the full-screen DVD.  This is a film that can be enjoyed at any time of the year, but especially during the holidays.  Watch and see whether Ralphie will ever get his beloved, official, Red Ryder, Carbine-action, 200-Shot, Range Model, Air Rifle!"	5.0	"""You'll shoot your eye out!

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	Twenty years after its initial release, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; remains one of the most heartwarming, human and enjoyable Yuletide tales ever.  The casting of Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin was truly inspired and are at the heart of this classic.  Billingsley's unabashed imagination, his wide-eyed awe of all that goes on around him, his desire to get that beebee gun, and his joyous love of life is one of the best children's performances on celluloid.  Melinda Dillon's Mom is a joy to behold---witness how she gets little Randy to eat his mashed potatoes and meatloaf--what a marvelous performance she gives--her love and admiration for her husband and children is evidenced in so many sublte ways and Dillon captures and embodies the wonder of motherhood.  McGavin, needless to say, is awesome.  Childlike, foul-mouthed, but the biggest kid in the movie.  This movie alone shows what an underappreciated and fine actor Mr. McGavin is.Christmas' true meaning and its simplicity and joy have not been captured any more effectively in this Christmas gem.Have yourself a merry little Christmas and watch this one every year!	5.0	A CHRISTMAS NECESSITY	2003-12-14	3	3	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1VBCBCIAZISRE	Michael R. Monteleone	I'm no movie critic, so my review won't be profound nor long. This movie is truly wonderful in its truth and simplicity.  I am a fifty-one year old man who grew up geographically, culturally, and time-period wise, parallel  with Ralphie, the central character and 1st person narrator of the movie.  And, I remember well what it was like to be nine years old then and there.  The pain, the fears, the frustrations, the unknowingness, the dreams and  hopes are all so real yet so incredibly funny.  Anyone who has livied  within a large family will recognize the Xmas scenes where the neighborhood  dogs enter the house and carry away the Xmas turkey and how the family is  forced to have Xmas dinner in a Chinese restaurant with the restaurant  staff attempting to sing Xmas carols with their delightfully funny Chinese  accent.  Culturally, in the midwest in the late forties and early fifties,  only a Chinese restaurant could be found open in a small midwest town on  Xmas Day.I recommend this movie to anyone who ever was a young boy or  who knows a young boy.  It is delightful!	4.0	Christmas, in the wonderful mind of a nine year old.	1999-12-04	1	1	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A4QC76NMWE5OC	"Michael Taylor ""Michael Taylor"""	"A few days before Christmas I watched ""A Christmas Story"" for about the 15th time as my wife and I have made this a yearly ritual.  The funny scenes are numerous and still tickled my ribs, particularly:1.  Ralphie dressed as a deranged Easter bunny or a pink nightmare as defined by his father.2.  Flick getting his tongue stuck to a frozen flag pole.3.  The duck getting its head chopped off at the Chinese restuarant.4.  The Bumpus' dogs destroying the much coveted Christmas turkey dinner which led to the Chinese restuarant scene.5.  Ralphie's mother getting the younger brother to eat his mashed potatoes by getting him to pretend he was a pig at an eating trough.6.  Ralphie beating the living daylights out of the bully Scott Farcus (sic?).7.  The impatient Santa Claus and elves at the department store who terrorized the kids.8.  Ralphie's dad's winning the tacky leg lamp.The movie is a great story about Christmas time in the Midwest in a simpler era (I guess the 1950s or so) and the small town values that many today yearn for.  The movie still entertains and teaches good values without demeaning the true meaning of Christmas without being politically correct (i.e. - singing Christmas carols about Jesus Christ during an opening scene, closing the movie with Ralphie's parents snuggling up on a couch on Christmas night to the tune of Silent Night).The only reason I did not give the movie 5 stars was the cussing (of which there was too much for my taste).  I believe the cursing could have either been totally deleted or muffled so the audience could not discern what was being said (as in the father battling the broken furnace scene - wish there could have been more of that).  I understand it is now possible to have your dvd or video doctored to where the cussing can be deleted and we may indeed do that.  I realize this sounds prudish to some, but we do have children.Complaint aside, I do recommend the movie as a Christmas classic.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AT0BNK1OXS649	Michelle Bowden	I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it.  It's one of the first videos I ever bought.  This movie has captured how it feels to be a kid--dealing with bullies, friends' dares, little brothers, Christmas anticipation, teachers, broken glasses, disappointments, and fear of your dad when you're in trouble.  Some things never change, I guess.  I love Ralph's daydreams, his whiny little brother Randy who won't eat unless he can be a pig, and the pink bunny pajamas from Ralph's aunt Clara who &quot;had for years not only perpetually labored under the delusion that [Ralph is] 4 years old, but also a girl.&quot;Oh Fudge, wash my mouth out with soap (but please don't use LifeBouy)!  There are a few bad words in the movie, but not many.  It's limited to a couple of S.O.B.'s and a couple of smart-a**es.  Most of the bad language in the movie is simulated.  Because Ralphie's father swears all the time, Ralphie learns to swear.  I think that is a good lesson for everyone.  And who has not at least wanted to beat up a bully?As a mother, I can understand the &quot;irrational prejudice against Red Ryder and his Peacemaker&quot;.  What I can't understand is the few people with irrational prejudice against this movie.  It's just as cute as can be.  See it with your family.  I think just about everyone will enjoy it.	5.0	Be A Kid Again!	2000-12-11	5	5	0

I used all those soaps mentioned & had a couple put into my mouth as well. Grandma didn't mess around.The kicker scene is Santa saying, ""you'll shoot your eye out kid"", & pushing an open mouthed, shocked & shattered Ralph down the slide with his foot. Ralph thought that only Santa would understand & could help him get his Red Ryder BB gun.Watching this movie, it's like I'm being hugged by my grandmother & what I wouldn't give to have that happen right now.I don't know how popular this movie is with the younger generations, but this movie resonates to my core."	5.0	Can't you see I'm busy?

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1Y78WGTPIN9YV	"Michelle ""Navy Gunner"""	"My family and I have watched this movie every Christmas.  The film and story is beautiful.  The story of young Ralphie during 1940's Christmas.  To be played in a 24 hour marathon on TBS is a little excessive but it gives us a chance to watch the movie as a backdrop to Christmas parties.  The dvd has some nice editions to it.  The special features are fun.My 83 year old grandfather remembers a lot of this movies references; i.e. the Red Ryder BB gun (his mother wouldn't let him have one for the same reasons as Ralphie), the Lone Ranger, Little Orphan Annie radio show, and Ovaltine.I like this movie because it's a family theme story.  Ralphie and his family's ups and downs during Christmas kind of reminds of my family.  Ralphie's friends are familiar to the kids I knew at that age.  The triple-dog dares were big at my mom's age, grandparents and myself.  The ""profanity"" is both funny and reminder to all the names my sister and I said (""ass-tronaut,"" ""h e double hockey sticks"" and of course ""fudge"").This is a true classic Christmas movie that will always be a tradition to be watched in my family."	5.0	A Christmas Tradition	2012-12-18	1	1	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"""You'll shoot your eye out, kid.""With those six simple words not only were dreams of an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle altered forever, so were the normal holiday movie traditions of Americans across the country. As popular as this feature is today, this did not take hold until quite recently. When A Christmas Story opened in theaters back in 1983, the studio that produced the film had no confidence in it, thus launching the film in only 886 theaters. By the end of its run, the film pulled in a disappointing $19 million and its television rights had been sold off quickly without a second thought. It wasn't until the TNT television network began to offer numerous viewings of the classic holiday comedy over the festive season did the film begin to finally be accepted by the masses. Now A Christmas Story has joined the ranks of such other yuletide treasures as It's a Wonderful Life and A Charlie Brown Christmas as a true staple of this special time of year.The story fellows the adventures of a young boy set against the Christmas holiday in the 1940's as he dreams of the perfect holiday gift. Ralphie Parker is like any other typical young boy in the 1940's but there is something that does set him apart from the rest of the pack. His aspirations for an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle, the one item that he believes to be the perfect Christmas present. Unfortunately for young Ralphie, he faces stern opposition from his mother who believes the toy will ""shoot his eye out"". He receives no help from his father who is too busy holding off the Bumbus hounds or shouting at the furnace, so Ralphie seeks to find higher help for his cause, the big man himself: Santa Claus. But even this last splint of hope is dashed to pieces with those devastating words coming from the ""jolly"" fat man himself, ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid."" All hope seems lost for poor Ralphie but if only he knew what Christmas Day would bring! The plot for A Christmas Story is one of the most wonderful concepts ever attempted in a holiday feature film and what makes it so memorable is the fact that many elements, no matter how elaborated, can be related by one family or another in some point in their lives.The biggest highlight of the comedy has to be how each character is cast perfectly. Peter Billingsley, who takes on the role of Ralph Parker, showcases a delightful performance despite his relatively young age. Many of the funniest moments of the feature come from his reactions alone to certain situations. Melinda Dillion gives a wonderful if not eerily familiar performance of Ralphie's typical 1940's mother. She works perfectly opposite Darren McGavin especially over the battle of the broken leg lamp. McGavin more then likely outshines them all with his over-the-top performance as Ralphie's Old Man. His shoutings of ""Don't anybody move!"" and ""Notafinga!"" will likely stand the test of theatrical comedic time but it is his overall good fatherly nature that makes every audience member feel as if they are witness a part of their own familiar past. Though he is not remembered by his name, Jeff Gillen does a hilarious take on the mall-Santa, stingy elfs and all. And Jean Shepard, who wrote the book on which this film is based on, gives a perfect off-beat narration of the film with perfect tones and comments for each situation as it happens in the feature. The narration works almost as well alone as the actions performed in A Christmas Story.Overall, Can the Christmas season be fully complete without at least one viewing of A Christmas Story? You can try but all bets are that even the ""Grinchiest"" person can't escape the irresistible personality of this yuletide comedy. There are so many wonderful things going for this film that it is hard to pick out the flaws. If anything, the last portion of A Christmas Story tends to drag a little bit near the end unlike earlier parts where actions were performed in a much quicker pace. In a way like Christmas Vacation, many of the elements within A Christmas Story connect with someone at one point or another based on their own Christmas experiences with their family. Though some would not like to admit some of the more embarrassing memories (aka looking like a pink nightmare on Christmas morning), we can all relate to young Ralphie's blight of getting the perfect Christmas gift when we were his age. But in the end, we realize that family, no matter how embarrassing or bumbling they may be, is what is the most important during the holidays. That is one memory that we should always keep close to our hearts no matter what time of the year."	4.0	The Moose Hole - The Perfect 'Christmas Story' for Everyone	2003-12-28	15	13	2

With Amazon, I was able to share it with my family as well.

Yes, I know it's not A Wonderful Life but I think that is the reason why I can relate to this movie.  The family in this movie is so typical of a family in the 1940's and the moral of this story is....Mom is alway's right.  Ralphie's mom won't let him get a BB gun because she says ""you'll put your eye out"".  The whole movie is based on Ralphie trying to convince his parents, his teacher and even Santa that he does deserve a BB gun.  There are many memorable scenes to this movie but my favorite is when Ralphie says the ""F"" word.  It is hilarious because his parents, just like parents today do not realize how much of what they say is absorbed and repeated by their children.  I thought that this scene along with others just made this the funniest Christmas movie."	5.0	My Favorite All-Time Christmas Movie	2005-12-27	2	2	0
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2JDWQN4JT6H09	Miz Brody	"Despite this shortcoming, if one can call a lack of special effects a shortcoming, this classic (adult) story from Jean Shepherd rings bells long gone rusted in the nostalgic heart. If you have a heart for the old days of the forties and fifties, this film will entrance you from the moment you hear Shepherd's voice-over narration. It's a timeless tale of simple lives at Christmas time and a family that could live on any block on Main Street, USA, only funnier.Don't be fooled by the ""kiddie"" appearance of the cover. This is definitely a story for grown ups. Today's children would not be able to relate to it, which is a shame.Bringing you back to the innocence of BB-guns and practical jokes and schoolyard bullies, this warm tale of Christmas past will make you long for the days when everyone wasn't so politically-sensitive and folks took responsibility for their own actions.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3IMNZSYDOTTU6	"M. Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife"""	A CHRISTMAS STORY is a timeless holiday movie classic, right next to THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS (cartoon version, movie version still good). This splendid holiday tale is about nine-year-old Ralphie's wish to get a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas. The little subplots: one involving the tongue stuck to the frozen pole scene; the bullies Scott Farkus and his sniveling assitant; and Ralphie's dreams of the teacher loving all his work...it's all crucial to how great this movie really is. Jean Shepherd's commentary during parts of the movie also adds to the comic splendor you'll laugh with. All the actors in this movie are terrific, especially Darren McGavin, Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon, and the teacher and Ralphie's brother. They show 24-hour marathons of this movie on TNT every Christmas Eve/Christmas Day...and it's easy to love this timeless classic again and again.You and your family will love this splendid tale, and may it bring warmest wishes for your holiday seasons to come!

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1QMY6L01RPEQ0	M. Lovasco	If you're looking for a timeless and hysterical holiday flick, do yourself a favor, BUY THIS MOVIE!!  I remember growing up watching this movie during the holidays when it first reached TV in 1985.  I was five years old then and every year since have watched this movie at least once or twice during the season.  Not until two years ago, when Jean Shephed, the writer of this movie and voice of grown up Ralphie, died suddenly did I really appreciate the satyrical and amusing dialogue of the script.  Some of the most memorable quotes and funniest scenes of any holiday movie came from this flick (and I don't mean Scotty Schwartz).  &quot;You'll shoot your eye out&quot;, is the most well known line, but many are much funnier.  &quot;They looked at me as if I had lobsters crawling out of my ears&quot;, &quot;My father worked in profanity as other artists might work in oils or clay, a true master&quot;, and &quot;Football?  What's a football??  My mind had gone blank!!&quot; are just a few of the hilarious quotes and scenes in this great Christmas masterpiece.  Since Christmas is that day in which the entire kid year revolves, this would make a great present under the tree, or an even better early Christmas Eve surprise to watch with your family.  My fiance and I watch this movie every year and laugh out loud every time.  This is the best Christmas movie or program that exists.  A Charlie Brown Christmas, Rudolph, and Garfield come close, but nothing beats Ralphie's Christmas adventure in his quest for a Red Ryder 200-shot Range Model Air Rifle!  Don't shoot your eye out!

Every year, this movie gets better and better. How can you not like it?  Told from the point of view of Ralphie, this film looks at  Christmas from a child's perspective. It shows just how strange the world  can be sometimes, and just how difficult it can be to grow up.  Parents,  bullies, and various other situations pop up during Ralphie's quest for a  BB gun for Christmas. It really makes you remember how Christmas was when  you were a kid,and despite all the quirks and discrepancies, how wonderful  it is to have a family around during that time of year.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2UQIIJ2CD8REE	Monty Moonlight	"Based on the highly nostalgic ""Ralphie"" stories of master humorist Jean Shepherd, ""A Christmas Story"" takes us to Holman, Indiana in the year 1940 to tell the tale of one little boy's seemingly hopeless quest to get a Red Ryder B.B. gun for Christmas. Young Ralph Parker plots tirelessly against the persistent warnings from mother, teacher, and even a nasty store Santa Claus that he'll surely just shoot his eye out! It's not a complicated plot and is full of episodic little incidents, but every moment is thoroughly enjoyable. The combination of nostalgic, relatable situations and characters and a perfectly selected cast of talents (including Kolchak the Nightstaker himself, Darren McGavin, as the Old Man), not to mention Jean Shepherd's pure brilliance (including his genius as a narrator, which he does for all the Ralphie films), make this film a true cinematic treasure. If the fact that it is one of MY favorite movies of all time isn't enough to convince you to check this one out, how about this: It is so beloved that, for years, it has been run in a 24 hour loop on cable on Christmas Eve/Day to consistently be viewed by millions of joyful fans. This low-budget (you could hardly tell), 1983 masterpiece has become a true classic and genuine phenomenon resulting in a flood of merchandise in recent years (yes, I have the action figures) as well as making the Parker family home a legitimate tourist attraction.Here, it is made available on Blu-Ray for the second time with a small assortment of extras ported over from its initial Blu-Ray release, as well as the same transfer which many were not pleased with. Personally, as someone who only owned the original DVD release before this, I'm just thrilled to have it in widescreen finally. Though, I'm disappointed to find that not all the bonus features from the previous, 20th Anniversary Blu-Ray are included on this one, especially the Jean Shepherd audio material. What we do have here is a ""documentary"" that is quite enjoyable, though it is no ""making-of"" by any means. It is really just a collection of ""looking back"" interviews with the child stars and late director Bob Clark. Also, we get an excellent audio commentary with Bob Clark and star Peter Billingsley (Ralphie). Funnily enough, just like many of the film's fans, they are not sure what year the film is set in themselves, even though you can find the year ""1940"" very clearly visible if you look in the right place (on Ralphie's decoder pin that he receives in the mail). Other bonus features include the theatrical trailer, a brief featurette on Red Ryder B.B. guns, some script pages of two deleted fantasy sequences, and a commercial for leg lamp replicas you can actually purchase. There's also a cheesy featurette called ""Get a Leg Up"", which is essentially an infomercial for the leg lamps being sold by the aforementioned commercial. I wouldn't mind getting one of these leg lamp replicas myself, but I could do without TWO commercials for them on this disc. Overall, some of the bonus features are very good, but there is a lot of missed opportunity, and why drop bonuses from the previous edition? That's a practice I'll never understand! I say get this if you don't own the movie yet, or if you only own fullscreen versions. This Blu-Ray is okay, but the movie itself is a must own. I do wish I'd gotten the previous Blu-Ray release though (with the red cover). I bought this one (white cover) somewhat blindly, because I found it at a great price and had promised myself I would finally upgrade this year from the fullscreen DVD.Now, before I end this, I want to recommend all those who find they love this film to look into the other 5 Ralphie films. Yes, 5! In fact, 3 of them predate ""A Christmas Story"". First, there was ""The Phantom of the Open Hearth"", which told of teenage Ralphie's prom experience, not to mention giving us the first screen depiction of the leg lamp story. That was in 1976. Then, in 1978, ""The Great American 4th of July and Other Disasters"", which is a true favorite of mine and stars a young Matt Damon as Ralph, again a teenager in a real Ralphie-style 4th of July must-view celebration. The blind date bit is priceless! Then, in 1983, there was ""The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski"" (okay, admittedly, not sure if this one came out before or after A Christmas Story). Again, we see Ralph as a teen in this one, when he finds his first love in the Polish girl who moves in next door after the hillbilly Bumpuses move out. Technically, this is Ralphie's Thanksgiving story, and it's very fun and funny . All three of those were television films made for PBS's American Playhouse, as was the next Ralphie film, showing a bit of influence from ""A Christmas Story"" this time, as here Ralph is a little younger. The film is 1988's ""Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss"", and it tells about Ralph's first job, the family's lost dog, and the big, annual, family road trip. Finally, we have the most direct sequel to ""A Christmas Story"", the big screen release from Christmas Story director Bob Clark, ""My Summer Story"", which is set the summer after Ralphie received his Red Ryder blue-steel beauty. This little noticed 1994 film, like all the others, stars a mostly different cast (Charles Grodin is the Old Man here, and Mary Steenburgen is Mom, with Kieran Culkin as Ralph), and tells the tales of Ralph's summer quest for the ultimate fighting top, mom's gravy boat incident, fishing with the Old Man, and a trip to the World's Fair. ""My Summer Story"" is also sometimes called ""It Runs in the Family"", but it's not the only film that has used that title. Bottom line, if you love ""A Christmas Story"" for all of it's great qualities beyond the Christmas stuff, then you will likely enjoy all the other Ralphie films too. All are fine films with great, nostalgic stories and casts, and all are narrated by the late, great Jean Shepherd. I recommend them all! Though, you'll have to be net savvy to get the PBS films. My Summer Story, happily, IS available on DVD, and Ollie Hopnoodle's did get a VHS release. Incidentally, I first saw all these films on the Disney Channel back when that channel was seriously good. Some of you may remember that as well. Happy hunting!Update: You may or may not have heard about the soon to be release ""A Christmas Story 2"", coming direct to DVD. It's toting itself as the ""Official"" sequel to ""A Christmas Story"", as if this one was not. Well, you can watch the trailer online already, and it is really... something. Amazingly, they have done a great job capturing the look of the first (better than My Summer Story did, sadly). Tragically, the acting and lines do not impress (and why does Ralph look like a dummy this time around?). Of course, it looks like they are just trying to do a lot of copying and referencing to the first, too. Okay, sure, this was a bad idea from the start. Shepherd and Clark are deceased (who in the world is narrating this, I wonder?), and the cast is all new, and the writing is clearly contrived, direct to video sequel kinda stuff. Still, when I see the production values and the way they managed to capture the look of ""A Christmas Story"" in the trailer, I do wish they had somehow found a great writer and great actors for it. Oh well. We shall see how it goes. I mean, how can I NOT see it?"	5.0	One of my favorite movies of all-time! Not just among Christmas movies!	2011-11-10	10	10	0

If you grew up in the 50's or 60's this film will really bring back memories of being a kid at Christmas time, but anyone should be able to relate to this film. I avoided this film for a few years because TNT played this film continually for 24 hours every Christmas. I finally was ready for a viewing and what better day to do it?The film is a timeless classic brimming with the excitement of the holiday. The narrative only enhances the dialogue going on in our own minds. This was Christmas in a simpler time, when the emphasis wasn't on over spending, but the thought of family and that one special item for Christmas morning could make all the difference.The two disc set is very nice with full and widescreen versions of the film included, There is also a fair amount of extras including commentary, trivia game, ""making of"" feature-ette with on screen comments by the director, Billingsley and three other child actors from the film. There are spots on Daisy rifles and the famous leg lamp and a few other interesting tidbits to toggle through. While most of the extras are fun, none of them are essential or give any real insight on this excellent low budget film.

The story and filmography will make you think that this was a classic you grew up with as a kid.  However, unless you were a kid in 1990 - you're wrong.  It was released in 1983.As far as the DVD is concerned - there is nothing to get excited about.  Aside from the theatrical trailer, there are no special features on this disk.  In fact, it's only available full-screen format and the audio isn't even stereo.If you're looking for a high-quality holiday movie that the entire family can enjoy - you just found it.	5.0	Destined to be a christmas classic	2002-10-09	0	0	0

The movie follows Ralphie, his friends, and family through hilarious adventures, most of them revolving around the bb gun.Laughs abound in this movie and you can't help but cheer for Ralphie when he finally receives his coveted Christmas gift.Every Christmas I watch this movie and still cannot get enough of it. Although I own it both on VHS and DVD, I can't help but watch the 24-hour marathon on TNT on Christmas Eve.This is one movie that is a classic and will be loved for many generations to come!

At the time I was wondering how there could have been a Christmas film that I had never seen before, not realising that it had been out for a short while at that time.I laughed throughout the movie as nostalgia shook my memory. I remember being told that if I had a bb gun I would shoot my eye out. I remember my mother washing my mouth out with soap, and when Ralphie's mother asked where he had heard ""that"" word his answer is Schwartz but he knew that it was his dad which has actually taught him the word. It reminded me of my youth as these things actually happened to me and others that I knew so to me the movie portrays a normal family for that generation. Oh to be able to go back to that time for just a few minutes.If you're looking to buy A Christmas Story then by all means go ahead.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	ADM42VSJD4A5E	"namepeace ""namepeace"""	This movie captures the entire Christmas spirit in a comedic slice-of-life, almost Seinfeld-esque fashion.  The dynamics of Ralph's family are universally understood, and the genuine nature of the story shone through the Christmas themes.  The performances were dead-on perfect, including Darrin McGavin as the cantankerous Old Man and Peter Billingsley as the fearless hero Ralphie.  The misadventures of this clan (changing the flat tire, the Bumpus hounds, the parental struggle over the lamp, the &quot;summit&quot; with Santa, Christmas dinner) are a scream.  And best of all, it captures the highs and lows of the best holiday around.  This is one of the best comedies ever and a holiday staple.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is the brilliant spoof and satire of 'traditional' family life, set during the depression. From the narrative rose-colored memories of his own childhood, Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) reflects on the year when he desired nothing more than to own his own shot gun. Mom (Melinda Dillon), of course, is dead set against the purchase. Dad (Darrin McGavin) might be a bit more receptive to the idea, having just won a company sponsored contest in which the grand prize is a fish-netted stocking lamp. A slew of calamities ensue that perfectly and poignantly capture all of the clich? and kitsch of the period. Who can forget the incident at school where Schwartz?s (R.D. Robb) tongue gets glued to an ice cold metal pole on a dare, or the hilarious Christmas dinner scene at a Chinese restaurant? When Mr. Parker declares that he can?t eat the goose he?s been served because ?it?s staring at me? a diligent waiter produces a cleaver and promptly decapitates the bird right in front of the whole family.  Mmmm, yummy!  Truly, this is one funny film!Warner gives us an average effort in their DVD remastering of this film. Previously, ?A Christmas Story? had been made available in a full frame only edition with no extras. This time around we are given an anamorphic widescreen transfer but contrast levels continue to be too low and the colors, somewhat muted. Certain scenes are incredibly soft while others suffer from considerable film grain. Pixelization, aliasing and edge enhancement exist throughout. The audio is mono and nicely balanced. Disappointing - nevertheless.The author of the book - Jean Shepherd, reads his story as part of the extra features that also include a new documentary on the making of the film and some hidden easter eggs (how ironic - easter eggs for Christmas!) as well as the theatrical trailer and a generally benign trivia game.	3.0	MEDIOCRE TRANSFER FOR THIS CHRISTMAS CLASSIC!	2003-10-07	2	1	1

If you wanna see the funniest movie ever made, you gotta get this one, because you will truly laugh your pants off.	5.0	Simply Hilarious	2004-04-16	4	2	2
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A295OPF6HX7XFP	Oldest & Wisest	"A CHRISTMAS STORY is the only classic Christmas movie to be made since SCROOGE in 1970 and it deserves five stars or more for its humor, honest sentiment, satire and brilliant recreation of a past era in American history.However, this ""special"" edition does not do it justice.  It is nice to have it finally available on DVD in a widescreen version (although there is doubt as to whether this is actually the original widescreen aspect), but the extras are sorely lacking.This certainly did not require a 2-disc version.  What do you get on the extra disc?  A promised ""documentary"" which is really an 18 minute featurette, two five minute ""documentaries"" on BB guns and leg lamps.  Two silly games which shouldn't take the dullest more than 10 minutes to complete.  And a couple of audio readings by Jean Shepherd of his classic monologues.On the movie disc you get the movie in both wide and fullscreen versions (though actually as I stated earlier you may actually be getting less of a picture on the widescreen than on the fullscreen version!) with a not very informative commentary by Peter Billingsley and director Bob Clark.  (Melinda Dillon is promised on the DVD cover, but she appears not at all.)I regret now selling my widescreen laserdisc version.  Not only was I fairly confident that it was the original projection aspect, but it had a great Norman Rockwell style painting on the cover depicting all the characters, not the bland color picture of Billingsley you get on the DVD."	3.0	Great Movie But Not A Very Special Edition	2003-10-11	6	0	6
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AH19S28453C3G	Ole Hoss	I'll never forget the first time I saw A Christmas Story.  It was in Columbus, Ohio, see?  I'm out there with my buddy to celebrate Thanksgiving with his mother.  This had become something of an annual tradition over the  preceeding years, and consisted of he and I chowing down on her wonderful cooking ( done in the biggest microwave cooker I've ever seen) and then taking her to see the movie of her choice.As might be imagined neither of us were too thrilled at the prospect of watching a cute bright eyed kid in a Christmas adventure, but, well, It was Momma's choice so we had to go without complaint, and, anyway, Darren McGavin was in it, so it couldn't be ALL bad.The opening credits rolled and the action started.  We heard the narrator describe the bacchanilia of greed, a voice that had come to us from over the airwaves of Fun City to the wilderness of northwestern New Jersey.  A voice that had spoken to us of Concrete Mexicans and other glories of slob culture.  It was SHEPHERD!  I had read the book!  Seldom have I enjoyed a movie so much.	5.0	Flick Lives!

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1IBWBU8OORAHI	Orion Christian Williams	I purchased this movie for my family to watch at Christmas time.  We had been amassing a good sized HD-DVD collection and we enjoyed this movie and didn't own it yet, so I purchased the High Def version.  Unfortunately, the graininess of the movie doesn't lend itself to HD so well.  I can rate the movie 5 stars, but the high def part is what this review is about.  IMAX blue planet is the only high def movie I've seen that looks worse.  Time of original release doesn't seem to be a factor in Picture Quality though, as Casablanca is one of the clearest pictures I have seen from a high definition movie.	3.0	Classic Christmas movie, less than classic picture quality.	2008-02-15	2	2	0

This past season it was revealed to me that my wife had never seen it and I was incredulous. I instantly opened Amazon Instant Video on my PlayStation 3. Given the option to rent or buy this classic, I didn't hesitate to purchase the rights to view this video from then on for years to come. It turns out that it might be more of a man's idea of traditional Christmas fare, as my wife was less than enthusiastic after experiencing the narrators recalling of a crude and boyish Christmas. My kids loved it and my wife offers no objections to bar A Christmas Story from becoming a family tradition.	5.0	Who doesn't love this movie.	2013-01-05	0	0	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2XU08B1X6MUOA	Peter Alachi	"In the nostalgic days of yesteryear, there existed a child named Ralphie in all of us. Narrated brilliantly by Jean Shepherd and based on his childhood memoirs, In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, A Christmas Story (1983) has truly become a splendid holiday favorite classic rivaling in its popularity Frank Capra's masterwork ""It's a Wonderful Life"".Set in the 1940's, director Bob Clark managed to capture the essence of childhood Christmas through the eyes of Ralphie, an unwittingly comical child whose imaginative character is both endearing and enduring. The plot revolves around Ralphie's aching desire for a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle for Christmas, and his mom's opposition to it because she's afraid he'll shoot his eye out. We're amused by dad's on-going fight with the basement's smoke-belching furnace, and the old man's almost incessant child-like awe and obsession of a tacky woman's leg lamp he had won in a contest. Amid all of this, we meet Ralphie's whiny little brother, Randy, his silly school friends, the street bullies, and the surreal department store Santa.Aside from ""you'll shoot your eye out"", the film is filled with memorable lines including Ralphie's major swear words ""Oh, fudge - only I didn't say fudge"", and ""Ovaltine? A crummy commercial? Son of a b..."" and his disappointment when he got his school paper back after he was expecting an A+, ""a C+? Oh no, it can't be!""The film appeals to all ages, but adults may find it especially amusing since it lets us look back and laugh at our own childhood."	5.0	"""Hey kid, you'll shoot your eye out!"""	2002-01-24	1	1	0

Much to the shagrin of the adults around him who constantly remind him he'll &quot;shoot his eye out&quot;. Peter Billingsley performs his heart out as we see him lay the child-like ground work to get his dream gun while having to put up with school yard bullies, a crotchity old father and the shame of all shames: having to wear a pink bunny suit on Christmas! More than just children will love this movie as I myself 'feel like a kid again' every year watching this great classic.	5.0	Christmas Wouldn't Be Complete Without It	2001-07-20	0	0	0

I don't give a darn about what some of them have done in the past... Here is my review of this Christmas Classic...Little Ralphie Parker wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas and his Mother to the Teacher tell him that he would shoot his eye out... It was funny to hear the kid talk about Grizzley bears and shooting the bad guys in his daydreams...I thought that it was good to see Peter Billingsly as he is now... Even his fellow actor that dared Flick to stick his tongue to the pole still looked the same too... The one who played Farkus was just having a ball in the interview! I could see that he and his fellow co stars had a great time doing the film...I even thought that it was great to see how that outrageous &quot;leg lamp was made... and even watching the film about how the BB gun was made.... As to the others that were not there, maybe &quot;Randy&quot; wasn't interested and The old man and the mom could not be added to the DVD to to space... DVDs are always improving... There is always a next time...I thought that the film looked sharp and crisp.. The commentary was really cool, and I thought that the 20th Anniversery release of this film was better then expected... I hope that some of you will give this new release a chance and Just injoy it... I know I will...&quot;You'll Shoot your Eye out Kid!&quot;	5.0	My review.... My Honest unbiesed review....

A Christmas Story is more than funny, however, it is also touching, a true slice of post-WWII America, and a touchstone for the season.Ralphie, a lad in late 40's Cleveland, goes through all the kid rituals of the season, fantasizing about getting a Red Ryder BB gun.  His mom (Melinda Dillon) and dad (brilliantly played by Darren McGavin) may have other ideas.  Can Santa or his grade school teacher intervene?  Will the local bully meddle?  Will he die of Lifeboy poisoning before the holiday?The film has great timing more than anything else, and the fade-outs to kid fantasies are hysterical.If you haven't seen Story yet, order and watch- it will be a seasonal regular.  If you know the film, it is time to upgrade to DVD and get a copy in your library.	5.0	It was an Instant Classic	2005-11-21	10	9	1

I should have remembered that using the PS3 with Amazon Instant video is unbearable. Netflix and all the others work fine with the PS3 but Amazon is not usable. You have to have a very patient group to sit and wait through the countless pauses due to bandwidth  issues and buffering.We have 12 Mbs DSL and have no trouble streaming except with Amazon via PS3. All other streaming works fine with the PS3.Also, the optimize option Amazon presents with the first sign of bandwidth issues does not make a difference.And yes, we have deleted and re-installed the app, etc.Sorry Amazon, you really need to fix this problem, as I am starting to look at other options.	1.0	Amazon Video streaming on the PS3 is unwatchable	2012-12-27	7	0	7
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AF8C86SGYLH81	"PR GUY ""PR Guy"""	This holiday flick definitely ranks in the Top Ten Christmas films of all time, but it caters to a unique audience.  The sense of humor is succinct (not subtle) and the acting definitely outlines the minds and thoughts of many during the Christmas season.  Any film that portrays the thoughts of youngsters when Santa Claus was real...when white Christmas's meant s-o-o-o much...and the excitement of opening presents early on Christmas morn, will love this film.  I believe the best acting performance is turned in by Melinda Dillion (Mom).  She is the most believable.  Child star Peter Billingsley is cute as a blonde, blue-eyed youngster, but he has very few lines and has ample cameo shots (without dialogue).  Veteran actor Darren McGavin is silly and boisterous...but Melinda wins the show.  A must during the Christmas season, this film is funny and will warm your heart.  I'm surprised I waited so long to watch this gem. However, I wouldn't show this film to children.  The angry father (profanity) and the bullish thugs at school may frighten the very young.

I did snicker at two lines in the movie, and it was interesting to go back to the times when kids sat around the radio with decoder pins as their form of entertainment.  But those three times I just mentioned, well that took up about 1 minute of the whole movie.  The rest was depressing and torturous.  I agree with the person who said they should have made it that he wanted the BB gun for his birthday, this way you could leave out the whole Christmas aspect, since the whole tone clashed with the spirit of Christmas anyway.  If you want to see a movie that is a bit twisted/cynical, yet has the redeeming powers of Christmas, get Chevy Chase Christmas Vacation.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A22WGRMMHUXZSI	Rafi Guroian	I bought this DVD version hoping that the transfer would be of a somewhat higher quality than the former MGM DVD release.  Unfortunately, it looks like they may have simply taken the pan and scan version that Turner owns  (the Turner logo is prominently featured) and runs each year on TBS, and  simply cleaned the video and sound up a bit.The video quality is fairly  clean (no obvious scratches, dirt, hair lines, etc) and the sound is clear,  but at times sounds like a slightly warped record (wavy notes).In the  area of supplements, the DVD comes only with alternate languages,  subtitles, and the theatrical trailer.This transfer is obviously not  taken from the original print, and it's a shame, because it deserves it.  The title, however, is worth the money regardless.  The price is fair, and  if a souped-up version is released in the future, it won't be for a year or  two.  In the meantime, given its price point, it's a good buy for those who  love the movie.	3.0	Not up to potential, but still great	1999-10-18	4	4	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"One memorable Christmas in the life of a nine-year-old in 1940's Indiana makes for a memorable movie and reflections on the innocence of youth in ""A Christmas Story,"" directed by Bob Clark and starring young Peter Billingsley, Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon.  What is happiness?  To young Ralphie Parker (Billingsley), it's simple; it's getting the best Christmas present a boy could ask for, namely a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot carbine action air rifle BB gun.  But it's getting close to the big day, and his hopes are fading fast; there's an obstacle between him and the coveted weaponry:  Mom (Dillon).  And the answer is ""No.""  But why!?  ""You'll shoot your eye out.""  Reasoning and wisdom to which there is simply no argument.  But, as Yogi once said, ""It ain't over till it's over,"" and a determined Ralphie refuses to give in or give up on his quest for the ultimate gift.  And as the story unfolds we get a glimpse, through Ralphie's eyes, of the way life was in another time and another place; an era long since gone, but never forgotten.  Based on a portion of the Novel ""In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash,"" by Jean Shepherd, with a screenplay by Shepherd, Leigh Brown and Bob Clark, Shepherd narrates (as the adult Ralphie), with reminiscences that are poignant and delightful; about Dad (McGavin), an Oldsmobile man, turkey lover and fabled ""furnace fighter,"" who in the heat of battle could weave a tapestry of profanity that as far as anyone knows is still hanging in the air somewhere over Lake Michigan; Mom, a woman who hadn't had a hot meal in years, thanks to tending to the needs of her family first; younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella); friends Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R.D. Robb) who share Ralphie's myriad adventures and set the protocol of the ""dare,"" from the singular all the way up to the coup de grace, the ""triple dog dare,"" employed during a contest to determine, once and for all, if one's tongue will in fact stick to a frozen metal flag pole; the endearing Miss Shields (Tedde Moore), the teacher who makes them write a THEME; and last, but not least, the yellow-eyed neighborhood bully, Scott Farcus (Zack Ward) and his toadie, Grover Dill (Yano Anaya), who give new meaning to the phrase, ""Say Uncle!""  There are humorous anecdotes about flights of fancy and lessons in life, like how to change a tire in record time and how to barter for the right Christmas tree (from Dad), and tricks used to get your younger brother to eat his food instead of just playing with it, as well as alternative uses for soap (from Mom).  We also discover how Ralphie learned a valuable lesson about how the journey is often the best part of the goal finally realized (courtesy of a ""Little Orphan Annie"" secret decoder ring), and the real meaning of a ""Major Award.""  McGavin is perfectly cast as Ralphie's dad, ""The Old Man,"" as he is referred to affectionately, and he gives just the right touch to all of the small ironies of life that seem to surround him, while Dillon gives a winning performance as his mom, whose TLC nurtured the warm memories from which this story was born.  But the most exemplary performance given here is by Peter Billingsley, who forever after will remain Ralphie Parker in the memories of anyone who sees this film.  There is an engaging naturalness about him that makes an instant connection with the audience, for he personifies the child in all of us, and it's a character you'll remember for as long as you retain any memories of your own childhood.  And therein lies the real charm of this movie; because everyone was once a child, and for better or worse, will carry memories akin to Ralphie Parker's (or Jean Shepherd's) forever.  A heartwarming, funny film, ""A Christmas Story"" is a true classic that can be enjoyed again and again and will most likely become an annual event once you've experienced it.  In the tradition of ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" and ""A Christmas Carol,"" this is a movie that can add so much to the festivities, no matter how you celebrate your holidays."	5.0	One You'll Remember	2000-12-13	13	11	2

This is an American film classic.  It certainly is not a perfect film, but it is endearing.  The settings are great, and it truly feels like you are transported back in time.  The acting is first rate all the way around.  The whole story revolves around little Ralphie's quest for a Red Rider BB Gun on Christmas.  Along the way we experience the Bully, the Leg, the tongue frozen to the poll, a scary Santa, the furnace, and the ultimate bad word among many warm humorous moments.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AY7YN8E6NFY94	"Richard C. Geschke ""In search of History!!"""	"As I've grown in maturity, my tastes have changed in many respects.  For most of my adult life my favorite Christmas story has been Charles Dickens classic scenario ""A Christmas Carol"" written in 1843 and which still remains as one of my favorite Christmas classics.  In fact the movie rendition by Alastair Sim is indeed a Christmas ritual to be seen by all.  With the last 20 years I've changed my mind as to the ultimate ""Christmas Story"".Up front, I must confess that this classic movie was indeed shot and is deeply ensconced into the very fabric of Cleveland culture.  The very house in the movie scenes is now a museum on the near west side of Cleveland.  The very mention of ""The Higbee Company"" issues the very essence of ""A Christmas Story"".  When these scenes were shot in January of 1983, I remember the cold sweeping winds coming off Lake Erie putting Northeast Ohio in a deep freeze.The story itself remains a classic in American culture.  Set in the fictional city of Hohman, Indiana all the dreams and culture of pre-World War II America presents itself.  In fact from a historical point of view the Depression was in fact over and America, not at war, was in the beginnings of unprecedented prosperity.  The actual beginning of life in America as it should be.  In fact Ralphie experienced life on the upswing.The fact of this pre-adolescent receiving a treasured Christmas present shows the rise of the middle class which has gone unabated since.  The Christmas morning scene in which the ""Old Man"" stated that he got a BB gun at Ralphie's age shows the end of the depression and the start of the ""good times"".  However as we watch this movie we can see that discipline 7 decades ago was very real.  Life was indeed more structured and disciplined.  The family not only ate their evening meals together, they also ate their breakfasts as a family unit.  Expectations were tempered and hoped for.  Life was easier but held more accountable.  Life was simple and fraught with troubles but in the end, life had meaning and purpose.This story shows us a piece of Americana never to be seen again.  Family life as shown in this movie no longer exists which to me represents the sad passing of an institution which is in desperate need in our 21st century way of life.  It's really no wonder why this story runs a 24 hour Christmas marathon each year.  This is the big screen equivalent of a Norman Rockwell painting representing what American life was."	5.0	"This Story Is Indeed Deserving of a ""Major Award""!!"	2009-11-08	3	2	1
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3KVV8JFC2G6WA	Richard C. Wedemeyer	This is a favorite at our house every holiday season. My wife LOVES this movie. It is the story as seen and narrated through the eyes of a young boy who deperately wants a BB gun for Christmas. He has a very traditonal, if not stereotypical, middle class family. He faces bullies and his family dynamics in a comical, yet sensitive way. Not really necessary to get the Blu-Ray when upconversion to 1080 would be just fine. No significant improvements were made in producing the Blu-Ray. Not even the added features were very good, useful, or entertaining. You do get to see the actors twenty years later, and a bit of commentary on the making of the movie is mildly interesting.	4.0	Great Movie	2012-10-07	3	2	1

Not to mention Amazon!  It's all about reliving those golden years of childhood, with the highs and lows that often followed one another quite closely.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2A4GFZMA7K7IS	R. MCCOSKER	First, shame on the outfit responsible for this DVD for not putting it out in its original theatrical widescreen ratio and otherwise providing those extras that give DVD the potential to be so superior to VHS (or regular broadcast television, for that matter). Presented in a decent DVD format, I'd've rated this 4 stars.Now, to the movie itself. It's very good, something of a minor classic, enjoyable on several different levels, and bears repeated viewings. The raves that dominate among the customer reviews here tend to go too far, but still this is a wonderful little movie, brimming with wit, insight, rich characterization and period detail.That said, some warning is needed beyond the PG rating -- many parents are apt not to take the PG seriously here, especially with the wholesome, somewhat saccharine photo montage bedecking its box.This is actually something of a dark comedy, with a mildly cynical view of childhood, a gently subversive attitude toward adult authority, and a jaundiced, almost paranoid, take on commercialism. There are moments of deceit, cruelty, intimidation, and (well-deserved) violence, all played for laughs. (There are heartwarming moments as well, applaudably noncloying.) Parents of young children take note.This is no FATHER KNOWS BEST or LEAVE IT TO BEAVER: There's no wise parent or pat ending here to iron out the wrinkles in the children's lives. What you get is a wry look at the (more or less) real life of a little middle-class boy, once upon a time in the Midwest.	3.0	Don't judge this DVD by its box	2002-02-26	3	2	1

It's not a classic in that it's a movie your grandparents really admire...but you have no use for.  Another word for CHRISTMAS STORY would be ""timeless.""  I have seen this movie nearly every year since it first came out on the big screen 20 years ago.  I enjoy it EVERY TIME.  All the classic comic moments remain hilarious even now.Tongue stuck to flagpole.  The bully with the yellow eyes...and his comeuppance.  The sexy lamp.  The frightening Santa.  It's all there.  Saying ""oh fudge!"" The movie had a beautiful feel of nostalgia when it came out, and it has the same feel today.  I think for many viewers, this movie has come to define what small town, depression era America was like.  Innocent in all the best ways.Oh, did I mention the dog and turkey scene?  Or the ""how to the piggies eat"" scene?Anyway, this is the one movie about Christmas that everyone has seen.  I can mention it to people who think high-art is THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS and they recall CHRISTMAS STORY with fondness.  I can mention it to people who normally only see films with sub-titles, and they ""ooooh"" with misty eyes at their favorite memories.Truly, there isn't a single scene in the movie that's stinker.  It's one of the leanest, meanest movies you'll ever see.  The fat was trimmed very well indeed.Peter Billingsley as Ralphie is perfect in the role.  This kid is almost as big an icon of Christmas entertainment as the Grinch!  Darren McGavin, a favorite of mine, is just terrific as the crusty father with the flair for expletives.  The list could go on.  Not a single role is miscast or forgettable.If by some chance you haven't seen it and can't decide whether you should or not...just go ahead and buy it.  Once you've seen the movie...it'll become a part of YOUR Christmas tradition too!(One very tiny note of warning: the movie doesn't deal with the religious aspects of Christmas one little bit.  It is a totally secular holiday, if this film is to be believed.  If you want a show that remembers the Christ in Christmas...then the Charlie Brown Christmas special needs to be under your tree this year.)"	5.0	The One we watch EVERY year!	2003-12-16	3	2	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2NOZB6VZCTOI4	Robert I. Hedges	&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is one of the true classics of American Cinema. I am admittedly not very big on most Christmas themed movies (too commercial), but I make a big exception here. Adapted from Jean Shepherd's wry book &quot;In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash&quot; and set in the American midwest of the 1940s, the movie follows young Ralphie, perfectly portrayed by Peter Billingsley, his family and friends during a youthful Christmas season.During the course of the film we get to see typical childhood problems through the eyes of Ralphie. The problems include dealing with a neighborhood bully, enduring hideous Christmas presents (most notably the pink bunny suit, which is not to be missed), and the dreaded 'triple dog dare.' A brilliant cast is directed by veteran director Bob Clark. The parents in this film embody the no-nonsense, yet loving, parents of period America, in this case played to perfection by Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin. The highlight of the movie for me is EASILY the delivery of the dad's 'major award,' and his wife's acute embarrassment when it is placed in the living room window. (That's all I am going to say about the matter: if you haven't seen the movie, this scene alone is worth the asking price.)The recurring theme through the movie is the angst induced by being repeatedly told that the one gift that Ralphie truly wants, a Daisy Red Ryder BB Gun ('with a compass in the stock and a thing that tells time') is off limits with the sentence &quot;You'll shoot your eye out.&quot; (Even the deranged department store Santa gives this same warning in another masterstroke.) In the end Dad turns out to be way more of a softy than we would have ever taken him for, and Ralphie has the best Christmas ever, despite the 'Bumpus hounds' devouring their Christmas dinner.For the 2 CD set, you get the movie (of course) and some truly wonderful extras, most notably a documentary &quot;Another Christmas Story&quot; which interviews Clark, Billingsley (who looks exactly the same as an adult), and many other cast members about the making of the film. Also included is a fun trivia game (I got one question wrong), and the mini documentaries &quot;A History of the Daisy Red Ryder,&quot; and &quot;Get a Leg Up,&quot; which irrevocably demonstrates that humor is alive and well in America.This is a classic!

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A24ZSL01CO4BBG	"Robert M. Collette ""rcollette"""	And so it happens that the media moguls have conspired once again to recreate yet another of our national traditions:  the annual reprise of a motion picture that has been blessed and certified by the entertainment  industry as a &quot;classic.&quot;  Only rather than let the test of time  determine what films are worthy of this especial classification, it is  instead forced down our throats with unrelenting promotional hype and  non-stop broadcasting, as is frequently done with &quot;A Christmas  Story&quot; on any of several Ted Turner-infected stations.  But this time,  the moguls got it right.&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is fast becoming a  Christmas tradition, where families gather around the television to enjoy  the warm sentiments and precise humor that decorate this film much as they  would gather around the Christmas tree to open presents.  And the reason is  simple.  &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; brings us back in touch with our  youth and the time of our life when we could daydream, feel carefree and  unbridled.  I have never seen another film that so perfectly captures the  unassuming, innocent imagination of a child and portray it on screen.  Who  cannot relate to little Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his desire for a  Red Rider BB gun?  We all felt the same way at one time or another for the  toy we had our own hearts set on, and the bitter disappointment when our  mother gave us her own rendition of &quot;You'll shot your eye  out.&quot;Jean Shepherd's heartwarming tale is filled with hysterical  anecdotes and memorable characters like the father (Darren McGavin) and his  &quot;tapestry of obscenities that, as far as we know, is still floating in  space over Lake Michigan.&quot;  Don't worry, his &quot;obscenities&quot;  are mumbled and indiscernible.  And the scene with Ralphie and Santa Claus  in the shopping mall is so side-splittingly funny that I would urge you  refrain from drinking beverages while watching it.  One slightly  disappointing observation was the lack of anything religious or suggestive  of Christmas' true meaning anywhere in the film.  But if we should ever  need a quick reminder, we can always look to Linus in &quot;A Charlie Brown  Christmas.&quot;	4.0	A Christmas Tradition	2000-06-20	1	1	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3NPJDKRCSPX9V	Robert Robey	A Christmas Story is a lovely movie sure to boost up one's holiday spirit. It's an excellent movie for families to watch together in their living rooms on Christmas Day. Children are sure to enjoy it along with their parents.The movie takes place during the holiday season of the 1940s and is about a nine-year-old child named, &quot;Ralph Parker&quot; who longs for a Red Rider BB Gun to have for a Christmas present. However, there is one obstacle he would have to face in order to receive this gift: His mother doesn't approve of BB guns! But Ralph is determined to get past that obstacle by persuading Santa to give him the BB Gun for Christmas.A Christmas Story is the movie I would definitely recommend for people to watch whenever the holiday season comes.	5.0	Wonderful for children and adults alike!	2001-12-27	1	1	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1AF01UOQ5935I	RobS	it's nice to see this classic in semi-HD. From what I've read, the original film was a lower budget movie, and therefore the original picture picture quality was never going to allow a great transfer to BlueRay. I wasn't expecting a super great version and can't compare the PQ to the non-HD DVD version, but was pleasantly surpriced it was very good. The extras are nothing to write home about, but if you're a big fan of the movie and don't currently own it on DVD, it's a great disc to have for the holidays.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2E7E9EWADK4S6	"Rosemary Thornton ""Niece of Murder Victim, Ad..."	I agree with a prior poster who said &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; may be the funniest movie they've ever seen.Our fam watches this each year at Christmas and we laugh until we turn colors and roll off the couch. Few  movies have the capacity to make me laugh hysterically, but this is one of  them.The father's mumbled obscenities as he descends into the basement  to make non-stop adjustments to the coal furnace damper is a classic. That  alone is worth the price of the movie. McGavin (the Dad) must have  practiced that bit for months. That man has a gift.And when Ralphie says  &quot;the *f* word&quot; - his mother demands to know where he learned such  vile language. The answer he wants to say is - &quot;from Dad,&quot; but  instead, he gives up a friend as the culprit and the scene that follows is  so very funny.Anyone who ever grew up with parents will love this  movie. It is satire at its best but on the cutting edge of truth.This  Christmas, I gave &quot;The Christmas STory&quot; away as a gift to several  friends and family. It is a classic unlike any other.	5.0	This movie is for everyone who ever celebrated Christmas!	2000-04-29	1	1	0

We purchased several of them for some of our friends about our age (60's) who had never seen this movie, and all of them liked it as well.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2T7PPMDKPPZYY	"""samroot"""	&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is a 1983 movie that has become a Christmas classic. This wonderful movie that takes place in the 1940's is about 9 year Ralphie, played by Peter Billingsley, and his dream of receiving a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot Carbine Action Air Riffle for Christmas.  Of course his mother, played by Melinda Dillon, is against Ralphie getting a bb gun for fear that 'he'll shoot his eye out'.  Ralphie's father otherwise known as The Old Man, played by Darren McGavin, is a gruff, childlike man who you'll find very entertaining.This movie is funny and very entertaining.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1K94LXX833JTT	Sanpete	"Amazon has combined the reviews for the Blu-ray and standard DVD versions of this set, which aren't exactly the same in their features.  This review is for the Blu-ray version.  My review of the standard DVD version is here too, so be sure you're reading the one you're interested in.The movie is excellent, a Christmas classic (see below).  Should you upgrade to the new Ultimate edition if you already have the 2006 Blu-ray edition?  That depends on how much you like memorabilia.  The new edition is a repackaging of the 2006 edition, with a couple new non-DVD extras:-- a collectible retro Christmas cookie tin (the container for the set)-- a strand of leg-lamp Christmas lights (Blu-ray exclusive)Those look like fun, if you're into that kind of stuff.  Amazon has a photo of the tin and a second photo that shows the tin and the leg-lamp lights.  (The announcement for this set said that the items from the standard DVD set (here) would be included in this one, but that isn't correct.)The Blu-ray DVD won't be remastered from the previous one.  The video quality of the 2006 release was only fair for hi-def, soft with fairly good color, with fair mono sound.The 2006 Blu-ray didn't include everything that was on the HD or the 2-disc SD set.  Here's what's actually included:-- audio commentary by director/co-writer Bob Clark and star Peter Billingsley (Ralphie)-- Another Christmas Story featurette, includes interviews with Clark and a few members of the cast-- Get a Leg Up featurette, about the making and ongoing sale of the (in)famous leg lamp-- A History of the Daisy Red Ryder featurette, on the object of great desire's actual history-- original theatrical trailerThe features from earlier editions that aren't included are trivia and decoder games, readings (audio only) from Jean Shepherd, and an ad for the real leg lamp.Now, about the really good stuff, the movie.  A Christmas Story is that odd film that appeals to a cross-section of viewers who often can't agree on what to watch.  Fans of sweet Christmas cheer are happily joined by people with a more jaundiced eye to the holiday.  To be sure, the movie leans more to the sweet than the sour, but it has enough edge and good-natured twistedness to please some of our darker Christmas angels too.  It conveys a genuinely warm nostalgia and some sharp, sometimes pretense-deflating observations about human nature.The story is set at some indefinite time around 1940 in an Indiana town approaching the holidays.  Young Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants only one thing for Christmas, the Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action 200-Shot Lightning Loader Range Model Air Rifle with a compass in the stock.  (That is, a BB gun, a very particular one.)  He plans carefully well in advance how to lay the groundwork for this while avoiding the dreaded rebuff, but almost everyone says it anyway: ""You'll put your eye out!""  The relentless struggle for the one true gift develops alongside several other small stories and amusing details, a tongue-on-frozen-pole triple-dog dare, facing the local bully, the notorious leg lamp, the Santa slide, Peking Duck for Christmas, and several others, each memorable in itself.The actors aren't very well known, but they're all just right.  There is narration throughout, representing an older Ralphie, done by the originator of the story, Jean Shepard, also just right.This movie, made in 1983, has gradually become a favorite Christmas classic, now shown in an annual 24-hour Christmas marathon on cable, which attracts a huge number of viewers.  If you've never seen it, give it a try, even if you have a little Scrooge in you, and you'll probably enjoy it."	5.0	Ultimate Collector's Edition mainly for collectors and those who don't have the movie on DVD/Blu-ray yet	2008-07-16	128	116	12

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB	"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First"""	&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; has been a part of my holiday tradition for the last ten years. This movie puts me in the Christmas spirit year-round! All Ralphie Parker wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB Gun. Ah, if life were that simple. His 1940's Midwest family is humorously dysfunctional: his father stumbles around yelling garbled curses at the malfunctioning furnace and worshipping &quot;The Leg Lamp,&quot; his little brother Randy is an annoying nuisance whose sole ability seems to be whining, and all the grownups in his life don't take him seriously. Throw in some school bullies, a wild imagination, and plenty of Christmas spirit, and you end up with the wonderful mix that is &quot;A Christmas Story.&quot; Every year my family will gather around the TV, with a fire in the fireplace and glasses of eggnog. We usually watch this at least three times a year: after Thanksgiving, on Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day. There is something magical about returning to the trials and tribulations of childhood, of the yearning and pleading and begging after that one Christmas gift that you HAVE to have, the sacred ritual of visiting Santa Claus at the mall, choosing that perfect Christmas tree (even if it ends up looking like Charlie Brown's), that first magical snowfall, the whole family decorating the tree, waiting for Santa and finally running down the stairs about as quietly as an elephant on Christmas morning in the quest to be the first to unwrap the presents in a frenzy of knotted ribbons and flying wrapping paper (hopefully NOT finding a pink bunny costume like poor Ralphie). This is a gentle, heartwarming, humorous tale of Christmas. It is rated PG due to minor swear words (and a narrowly averted major swear word)... and an imaginary shootout with BB guns. But it is a movie for kids and parents alike that celebrates family and the wondrous holiday known as Christmas. Happy Holidays!	5.0	Hey kid, you'll shoot your eye out!	2001-11-08	7	7	0
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AEM0D3OFOR9RQ	Sara	Lighten up the holiday season with this hilarious and heartwarming holiday classic. An almost magical story based on narrator Jean Sheapard's childhood adventures, this one is a classic in my family and should definately be one in yours. If you don't know the fear of a triple dog dare or the embarrassment of a young boy in a bunny suit you are MISSING OUT! It just isn't the holiday season without this movie. This film features great performances from Peter Billingsly as young cynic Ralphie, who only wants one thing for Christmas: A Red Rider BB Gun and Melinda Dillon as the American mom not to mention the father and Ralphie's hysterical little brother (&quot;Show Mommy how the piggies eat!&quot;). It also makes great use of the 'Peter and the Wolf' symphony. The film just stands out as a holiday classic because it's nostalgic air is so realisticly dreamy. There are charming and understanding moments (when the Mom sticks the soap in her mouth comes to mind) and all of Ralphie's daydreams are whimsical childhood fantasies. So this holiday season get in the spirit and habit of watching this flick.	5.0	The Christmas noose beginning to tighten?	2001-12-20	2	1	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2UGVZFKH8O5X4	Sean Parauka	"In 1983, the greatest Christmas movie of all-time was released: ""A Christmas Story"". This movie is my personal all-time favorite Christmas movie. When the Christmas season is coming, I can't stop watching the movie from November 30 - December 31. It's the only Christmas movie I can't get sick of. The cast, the story and the comedy is OUTSTANDING!!The movie starts out in a small Indiana town in the 1930's. Here we meet Ralphie Parker (Billingsley), a nine-year-old who is desperate to get his hands on the perfect Christmas gift: An official Red Rider Carbon-Action 200-shot loader range model air rifle. As badly as he wants this gift more than anything, his mom, teacher, and a mall Santa Claus say ""You'll shoot your eye out!"" That doesn't stop Ralphie from making his dream come true.As Christmas comes closer and closer, a bunch of mishaps happen between his friends, and his family. His friend Schwartz talked his other friend Flick into sticking his tounge to a flag pole, and his tounge got stuck. Then Ralphie beats up a school buly named Scut. His father (McGavin) wins a lamp that is in the form of a leg that he loves and nobody else does, including his warmhearted mother (Dillon). The really goofy side to his family is his cry-baby little brother Randy. He won't eat! He's always complaining and crying and his laugh is SO FUNNY! He's a typical six-year-old rugrat.Will Raplhie let a teacher, a mall Santa and even his own mother stop him from making his Christmas dream come true? You'll see. The movie really gets you into the holiday season. It's an EXCELLENT family movie. Everyone I know loves this movie. It's addicting! Your Christmas collection is not complete if you don't have this movie on your shelf. Even the T.V. station TNT does a 24-Hour marathon of ""A Christmas Story"" EVERY YEAR!

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A36LUH6P1IDL25	Sharon L Kerns	Brings me back to when I was a kid.  So much In the movie reminds me of my childhood.  From the bully with the yellow eyes and being chased down the alley, the Palmolive soap to wash your mouth out (which we got frequently), the snow suit where the little brother couldn't put his arms down (my sister had that red snow suit and the same problem, she walked to school with her arms in the air. Ha! She did look like she was going to pop), the dad who cussed at the furnace (how well I remember that), laying in all that Christmas wrap at the end of the frenzied unwrapping and hearing Dad say to Mama: &#34;My, gosh, would you look at all that mess!&#34;  I remember the meatloaf, mashed potatoes, the aroma of Mama's cooking drifting outside from time to time, and hearing the dogs barking away.  It kind of saddens me to watch it, not because it isn't a wonderful movie, but because I miss some of my growing up years, and this movie takes me back in time to the good and not so good parts of it.  Oh, and last but not least, the 'Red Ryder BB Gun', my brother had to have one, and the words of my Mama: &#34;You'll shoot your eye out!&#34;  Thanks for the memories Christmas Story, when I miss the days back when, I turn this on and for a brief moment am transported back to when things weren't so bad, or perhaps didn't seem to be..

Its not hard...This movie was shot in 1 37 1 which equals to (fullscreen). The theatre version was matted, meaning they cut off the top and bottom which is intended...The tv (fullscreen) version is the original 1 37 1..So when you buy the widescreen version its the matted version, exactly the one saw in theatres...So for all you ppl who think this was a widescreen movie cut into fullscreen then cut again to widescreen are wrong wrong wrong!!! come on ppl!!!...Read the technical stuff about the movie before you make a bad review....Home Alone, Christmas Vacation and this movie all were shot in 1 37 1 then matted for theatres, so if you buy a widescreen matted version its the theatre version!!!

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2B7BUH8834Y6M	"Shelley Gammon ""Geek"""	A friend of mine forced me to watch this film... the premise sounded stupid and I HATE sappy, stupid movies.  I was totally floored.  This is one of the funniest family films I have ever seen. This is not a modern-day  slapstick no-brainer comedy, but a reminiscent look into the simpler 1940s  when kids sat in front of the radio all night and dreamed of being  cowboys.Ralphie's (Peter Billingsley)  fantasy is to hold the Daisy  Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle in his hot little hands Christmas morning and his  life begins revolving around this fantasy as the holiday approaches. He  practices using the rifle with his hands, writes a school essay about it  and pesters everyone from his parents to Santa Claus to make sure it's  delivered under the chimney no later than December 24.Don't be misled by  the director (famous for &quot;Porky's&quot;), this is a family film. There  is one expletive used, which quite frankly could have been snipped in my  opinion, but the overall feel of this film is one of innocence, adventure  and fond Christmas memories.  I watch this film every year and laugh myself  sick everytime I do.  Remembering the way we used to think and perceive  things as a child is what this movie is about, and how in many ways, much  of what we thought makes a lot more sense than how we think now.Darren  McGavin's performance provides some of the most hilarious laughs... he's  constantly shifting from being a grumpy old man to a little kid in his  emotional rollercoaster ride of mid-life crisis and fatherhood in the  1940s.I can't recommend this film enough. My only regret is the lack of  extras on the DVD. How about an interview w/ the cast, especially now that  the kids have grown? How about out-takes? It's a sad shame that so often  film makers put their movies on DVD while paying no attention to what the  medium demands in relationship to content.	5.0	an instant classic, hilarious and sweet	2000-07-29	7	6	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A6PHQJZNGC370	S. Henderson	There's not much to add to all the fine reviews extolling the sheer perfection of this Jean Shepherd fantasy.  Someday the distributors will release a WIDESCREEN version with some extras that we've come to expect from DVD releases: background on the creators, outtakes &amp; deleted scenes, etc., but for now we have to be satisfied with the bare bones version here.  I have no complaints about the film itself --- it is flawless.  Those grumps who want to stand out by seeing this movie as the exact opposite of its intention (not for kids? COME ON, GROW UP!) will not enjoy anything remotely clever on the level of CHRISTMAS STORY but, so what, the world is full of people who only think ADULTHOOD=MATURITY.  This movie will be enjoyed by all ages for years to come...let's hope Warner Bros. is listening and they put together a definitive edition---I'd buy it in a second!	5.0	#1 XMAS CLASSIC	2001-12-27	0	0	0

For those of you who can't read, Amazon has even included pretty pictures and a video showing this.I pre-ordered mine back in August, and it was delivered the day of release.  The green tin can was in perfect condition, as well were the lights.  I was honestly expecting a rip-off strand of lights, something only 3-4' long, but this strand is appx 6'.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A26G3P11S7S61T	"""showbiz919"""	"Now before I even begin to review this movie, I would just like to clarify my title.  I call ""A Christmas Story"" the 2nd greatest Christmas movie of all time because in my opinion ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is the greatest Christmas movie of all time.Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's start the review!  This is a movie that unlike others, actually captures the true spirit of Christmas in every way possible.  Peter Billingsley stars as Ralphie, a young boy that cannot get his mind off of an official Red Ryder bb gun.  Right from the beginning of the film Ralphie is trying to hint to his parents what he wants for Christmas.  What makes this film really stand out is how it is told through the eyes and mind of a child.  You'll notice right off the bat, that the film does have a narrator, an older Ralphie.  But unlike other films, the narrator fits perfectly into the Christmas formula.Darren McGavin stars as Raplhie's strict and serious father.  This strictness however passes off as some of the best humor in the film.  You even feel like you're watching ""Married with Children"" at times because like Al Bundy, you just want great things to happen to McGavin.  But I will not give away plot details (even though everyone reading this has probably seen this movie over 20 times).As the story progresses the film continues and Ralphie is realizing how hard it is to try to convince his parents, teacher, and even Santa Clause, what a perfect gift the Red Ryder bb gun would make.  Each of these figures continues to haunt Ralphie with the classic saying, ""You'll shoot you're eye out kid!"".I honestly can't review this movie to make it sound even half as great as it truly is, so go watch this movie or even buy it because it can be wacthed hundreds of times without getting the least bit dull.  But don't watch it during summer becuase it will depress you and make you think of Christmas.  So grab some egg nog, sit by the tree and watch ""A Christmas Story""!!!!!"	5.0	The 2nd Greatest Christmas Movie of All Time!	2002-12-22	0	0	0
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2L9RSH5C5QSCX	S. H. Towsley	There are extremely popular films that I have resisted watching for one reason or another.  I see them on the video store shelves and I just resolve not to participate in whatever phenomenon made them into hits.  I don't apologize for that, since there must be people who do the same thing with just about every movie in America -- nothing gets 100% acceptance, right?  Right.Now I'm going to tell you  -- Go, and get A CHRISTMAS STORY, and see it.  It doesn't matter who or where you are, or how picky you may be, or what your preferences of films may be, or what you think about it, or how antisocial or contrary you may normally consider yourself to be.I don't care if your intellectual taste is high or low, smart or dumb, tasteful or kitschy, mainstream, radical or eclectic.  I don't care how you were brought up, or where, when, or in what race or creed.Go and get A CHRISTMAS STORY and see it.  See this movie.  Trust me, or don't trust me.  Just do it anyway.  You're welcome.A CHRISTMAS STORY is not only a universal delight, in terms of story, perfect casting, inspired directing and undeniable humanity.  It is the quintessential American movie about the Christmas experience and family life, like it or lump it, shop or don't shop, frown or smile, rich or poor, traditional or oddball.If you don't see this movie about a kid named Ralphie and his brother and his perfectly rendered mom and dad, you will eventually pass away and be the poorer for not ever having warmed your heart over the hearthfires of this very moving, perfect little American masterpiece.I'm not sure but what you don't have to have sampled this movie treat at least once in order to get into heaven.	5.0	See A CHRISTMAS STORY even if you NEVER see a movie -- any movie.	2006-12-07	7	7	0

With it's classic one liner's and moments of comical relief, all mixed in with a christmas wish for a red ryder bb gun, What better a movie to watch every holiday season. When you have TBS playing it all day on their 24 hour marathon on Christmas Eve and Christmas day, It is really hard to miss when you're flipping the channels. When the film came out, it did not do very well at the box office. Over the years it would gain more acclaim as one of the most beloved Christmas movies of all time. Now that they released a crappy sequel with Home Alone's Marv as the old man, I feel sad that Hollywood had to take the glory of the original and nibble some of it away as they do with a lot of classic Christmas film's these days. Example: Home Alone 3+4. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch the original because really there is no other Christmas film That holds the bar higher than this one. Except maybe It's a Wonderful life directed by Frank Capra. I have not seen it but have heard great reviews. Well, hope you guys are doing just fine and great.

A holiday classic that me and my parents watch every Christmas day, sort of a tradition for us. Even if you don't celebrate Christmas, you could love this film because it's hilarious and is a good example of how every kid/young teen is around the holidays: Anxious about whether or not they'll get everything they want, constantly pushing their parents to get that one gift they really want, finding ways to push them by putting little clues in their magazines, books, etc. And other than that, it's just a humorously crafted movie.The movie is about a boy named Ralphie who has longed for a Red Rider Air Rifle, but his parents won't give it to him and instead screw him over with the ""you'll shoot your eye out."" Along with finally beating up the neighborhood bully and finding out little Orphan Annie's ""secret message"" is, his dad buys it for him in the end and hides it under the tree. Of course, it doesn't stop there.

I attended a school just like the one 9 year old Ralphie attends, walking through snow to get there. There is a strong thread of truth that goes through all aspects of the movie and the characterization of Ralphie's parents, both tough and very loving, is especially enchanting.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2CX1YWW3K32P4	Steve Blevins	"Two Decembers ago, my colleagues and I were discussing Christmas movies over lunch. They were dumbstruck to learn that I had never seen ""A Christmas Story."" One offered to buy me the video. Then last month, a friend mentioned that a cable station would be showing back-to-back episodes on Christmas eve. So I watched it.It was the worst Christmas movie I had ever laid eyes on. Why would anyone desecrate Christmas with a tale of a vulgar father, a pathetic mother, and ordinary children, all living in a dilapidated home in a bedraggled neighborhood, overrun by obnoxious kids, and highlighted by an insipid teacher, a callow Santa Claus, and truculent elves?For the humor, of course! But the movie is humorless, the cast awful, and the story painfully long and pointless.The sine qua non of Christmas movies has always been a central message --some nugget of hope, or redemption, or love -- conveyed either seriously or humorously. This movie, having none of these, illustrates the extent to which postmodern cynicism has swallowed a beloved film genre. Good Christmas movies have universal appeal. Can anyone imagine this movie being seen outside the U.S.? I can't, unless there's a place where train wrecks are ""cute"" and reminisced upon with wistful nostalgia.SteveP.S. After posting the above review, I received a barrage of criticism. One thoughtful critic argued, correctly, that my review lacked specificity and perspective. And so I submit this addendum:My disappointment with the movie centers on four themes: the behavior of most characters, the absence of redemption, the absence of universality, and the absence of a transcendent message.Regarding the characters, I was especially disturbed by the parents. We are told that the father curses incessantly (though we do not hear his invectives). His fascination with the ugly lamp is bizarre and sophomoric; his rawness, disconcerting. He is not alcoholic or physically abusive, but these are the only elements missing from a caricature too often seen. The mother's obsequious relationship with her husband, which renders her unable, or unwilling, to express her distaste for the ""award"", presumably out of fear of verbal reprisal, is unnerving. (I can already hear the chorus of detractors saying her restraint stems from affection).Of course, each of us brings to a movie his personal experience. I have practiced medicine for thirteen years, and I cannot count the times I've encountered women who became withdrawn and depressed after years of quiet deference to overbearing men. Just the hint of such a relationship makes me recoil.By contrast, the children are endearing. But this is less a credit to the movie than a tribute to the general sweetness of youth. The children are not selfish, as some have suggested. (A child's wish for a gift and his joy in receiving it are natural. Having owned a BB gun myself, the experience is familiar). But as one reviewer states, every character above the age of 30 is scary. Two hours spent in a town overpopulated with beastly elves, bullies, and parents, is two hours lost.Second, I was saddened by the lack of redemption. Ask yourself this: Is any character improved by his experience? Imagine a Scrooge unchanged by his momentous journey. Imagine a Lear unenlightened by his travails. The hallmark of a great Christmas story --- of any great story --- is the transformative experience. From this emanates the hope and magic of Christmas.Third, the movie lacks universality. No one understood universality better than Shakespeare. His comedies are as funny today (in Indiana and India) as they were centuries ago. We relate to the plight of kings and paupers, without ourselves being kings or paupers, because their sufferings, joys, and longings, are our own, no matter the century or country. ""A Christmas Story,"" by contrast, is parochial. The vignettes are amusing only to those with similar experiences. Parochialism is not, of itself, detrimental, but it does preclude the designation, ""classic.""Finally, I was distraught by the absence of a transcendent message. One detractor explains that several messages are evident: listen to your parents, stand up to bullies, don't trust commercials, etc. But these are practical lessons, not universal themes rising to such heights as George Bailey, the Ghost of Christmas Past, or even Linus, have taken us.So my detractors close in for the kill: Isn't ""realism"" better than the canned moralizing of standard classics?If what we seek is realism, why not call this movie ""A Birthday Story"" instead of ""A Christmas Story?"" Had Ralphie requested a BB Gun for his birthday, his creators would have been spared the Christmas burden, the expectation of something ennobling --- hope, love, kindness, forgiveness, sympathy --- something that surmounts the mundane and takes us, if only briefly, to a finer place. In my humble view, Hammond, Indiana, is not such a place."	1.0	The worst Christmas movie ever	2006-12-25	77	23	54

I watched it for years before I learned about the writer/narrator Jean Shepherd, who was a remarkable talk radio host in the 50's-70's and spun stories about his youth and daily observations on life and distilled a lot of that into this masterpiece.  This movie is just as rich and charming, great family viewing and like a great cartoon, plenty of subtlety for the grown ups to laugh over.	5.0	A classic	2013-01-24	0	0	0
6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AP1PNZJXO9BS5	steve	I have read Roger Ebert's film reviews for decades and have found that my preferences follow his closely.  If Roger gives it a high rating I usually do too.  This is true for most films on his Great Movies list.  I watched &#34;A Christmas Story&#34; for the first time this week and really enjoyed it.  Being a child of the early 50's I can relate to Ralphie, in fact, he could easily have been one of my pals . . . I take it from his review that Roger felt the same way.  I will be watching it again--it's nostalgic and funny.  I don't know if the current generation of young people will &#34;get it&#34; when watching the movie but as a window on the 50's it speaks volumes.  In this regard it is like the movie Sandlot.	4.0	Good movie	2012-12-27	1	1	0

Over the years I have seen it a number of times and the film has clearly grown on me.  It shows the personal reflections of a young boy dealing with the mundane things young boys face.  Some of the scenes show just how ridiculous events and people (both young and old) can be.  The film has sparked a cult following that has grown to proportions that the famous leg lamp is now manufactured and available for anyone who has the desire (?) for such a thing.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	Bob Clark's &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is a cinematic slice of Americana. It chronicles an era long since gone when a BB gun was the dream present of every young child and when saying the wrong word would set up a meeting between your mouth and a bar of soap.Young Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) longs for a Daisy Red Ryder 200-shot Carbine Action BB Gun and makes no secret that he wants one for Christmas. However, everyone in his northern Indiana town warns him that he will shoot his eye out if his wish is granted. Ralphie stubbornly refuses to waver and hopes against hope that his wish will be granted while navigating around the other problems in his life - a school bully, a brother who has outgrown his snowsuit, an aunt who thinks he's a girl, a hazardous visit to Santa Claus at the department store, a tongue stuck on a frozen lamp post, and a decoder ring that decodes an uninspiring message.There really is nothing that distinguishes &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; from your run-of-the-mill seasonal made-for-television Christmas production. The feeling of nostalgia that the film generates basically is its only notable aspect. The jokes are routine and the characters are the typical generic stock figures you would find in any modern Christmas tale. Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon are amusing as Ralphie's parents and Billingsley has a short of charm as young Ralphie, but the performances aren't special enough to elevate the material. &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; does a wonderful job of recreating a certain place and time. However, it does not accomplish much more than that. In the realm of big-screen Christmas features, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; places somewhere in the middle of the pack.	2.0	&quot;Oh, I hate the smell of tapioca.&quot;	2004-07-04	78	3	75

I remember seeing it for the first time when I was in junior high school and the other kids were saying ""You'll shoot your eye out."" Over the years, I've watched it as my life has changed. But A Christmas Story has always retained its charm.I think that A Christmas Story is not so much about Christmas as it usually works out for most of us. Like most ""holiday classics,"" it's about the Christmas that we always hope that we will have. For those who first watched the film in the 1980s, it evoked nostalgia for a seemingly-simpler time. A Christmas Story celebrates family, friendship, decency, triumph over adversity, and not taking oneself too seriously. It probably goes without saying that this is a ""sweet"" movie.The only things that I dislike about this film are the sequences in which Ralphie fantasizes.

The movie was OK, but not likely to become an annual event for me.	3.0	A Holiday Classic????	2012-11-24	0	0	0

Both are a lot better than the VHS version. For under $10, its a no brainer to get this though.	5.0	Can't tell much difference from DVD version, but a steal for under $10 Blu-ray	2013-12-01	0	0	0

But then again, I read those reviews and they said that the main character, Ralphie, was a whiney little brat and that the father was evil and blah blah. These people are reading way too much into this wonderful movie. I pity the people who have a joyous Christmas where everything goes perfectly and they all sing carols and drink eggnog. I mean, wheres the fun in that? This movie embodies almost every family in one way or so and I always look forward to the 24 hours marathon of it on Christmas day. I will show this movie to my future children and hope they show it to their children and so on and so forth. Heck, I don't even wait 'till Christmas to watch it! It's a year 'round favorite.

THere are some traditions that stand the test of time, and watching this movie every single Christmas season is one of them. Even ELF, one of my other favorite Christmas films, did not get played this year, but A CHRISTMAS STORY got played all day long in the background while doing our holiday, family stuff.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3KYA26RJGRAWE	"T. A. Ashley ""Lover of all things gadgety"""	What can I say?  I just love this movie.  It is far and away my favorite holiday film.  Of course, I was a fan of Ralphie, Flick, Schwartz and the gang long before the film was released; as a teenager, I happened upon the writings of Jean Shepherd and have been hooked ever since.I've owned this movie in VHS format, the older DVD, now this wide-screen adaptation.  I'm certain if/when it comes out in HD-DVD or Blu-Ray, I'll probably get that too.  It's simply a slice of nostalgic Americana that I can watch over and over.Too much has been made over the latter-year antics of some of the child actors as they became adults.  Tragically, many make poor decisions in life and have to live with the repercussions.  This shouldn't detract from this movie's charm.  The kids are, in a sense, locked in time and forever young in this movie, and that's how I prefer to view them.The commentary reel had some great behind the scenes tidbits, and it was great hearing this group of talented people reminisce on scene after scene as it played out.  I would have loved to have seen some actual outtakes and deleted scenes, and perhaps in a future incarnation of this movie, they'll dig into the archives and include these.  I'd also like to see them do a true re-master of the film and restore the quality and vibrancy to the scenes. This is something of a national treasure, and it deserves to be preserved for generations to come.Bottom line: if you enjoy Christmas nostalgia, the humor of the late Jean Shepherd, or just want to be a kid again for a couple of hours, you just can't beat this film.  Whether it's December or July, it's a cool bit of entertainment for the whole family.  Now where's my Ovaltine and trusty Red Ryder carbine action BB gun...	5.0	Best...movie...ever!	2007-07-21	4	4	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1HNYZ2GVJQ02G	TD	As old a movie the Christmas Story may be, it will continue to have its twenty-four hour special every Christmas Eve because it's such a great movie. Not only is it hilarious, but it's also a great movie for the whole family to relax, lay around a warm fire, make some popcorn and all watch together. If you're looking for a funny, real-life, all together classic movie, The Christmas Story is the way to go.A Christmas Story was a hit when it first came out in 1983. Melinda Dillion, Darren McGavin, Peter Billingsley, and Ian Petrella are the four main characters in the movie. Peter, being Ralphie Parker, was the main one that the movie was basically all about. Ian was his little brother, Randy Parker, who followed him around all the time, and the other two were his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Parker. All the characters in the movie, evenif they weren't one of the four that I mentioned all added a little something to the flick.&quot;You'll shoot your eye out!&quot; That's all anyone ever said to poor Ralphie when he told them he wanted a Red Rider BB gun for Christmas. He didn't want a football. He didn't want a G.I. Joe. He didn't want that stupid, pink bunny suit he got from his aunt. All Ralphie wanted was his BB gun. The mother, being the cautious, old fashioned woman she is, wouldn't think twice about the BB gun, but the father on the other hand had a different point of view. Finally the big Christmas day arrives and the family opens up all the presents. No gun. The father asks Ralphie if he see's the hidden present that Ralphie must have missed. Could it be a football? Could it be a G.I. Joe? Could it be the gun? the Christmas dinner is a disaster, but Christmas as a whole was the best Christmas ever.The Christmas Story is a great movie to watch, even if it's not around Christmas time. It's so funny and fun to watch that there's no way anyone could possibly NOT like it. It's got great characters, an awesome theme, and a lot of humor.All in all, The Christmas Story is a must see. It's a Christmas tradition, and if you haven't seen it by now, make sure you tune your tv's to the Christmas Story on Christmas Eve all day and night long. The Christmas Story has beenone of my all time favorite movies since I was little, and it will continue to be, because no matter how long it's been around, this is a movie that will never grow old.	5.0	A Christmas Story	2003-12-03	2	2	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F	"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard"""	"""A Christmas Story"" was originally released to theatres during the Holidays of 1983, and the film was met with only modest success. Not a critical hit either upon its release, the movie has now become the most touching and heartfelt Christmas motion picture of all-time thanks to numerous showings on cable stations such as TBS, TNT, and pay channels like HBO. At one time the movie was so popular the film was actually shown in a continuous 24 hour marathon. Given a modest budget, ""A Christmas Story"" tells the simple story of a young boy named Ralphie who wants only one thing for Christmas: a bee bee gun. The film is set around the 1930's or 1940's and features an excellent cast of adult actors, but it's the young child stars that steals the film, most notably Peter Billingsley who plays Ralphie. What person wouldn't love Ralphie, what with his cute smile and big round glasses. The DVD has many bonus features, but it is the informative commentary that features Billingsley and director Bob Clark that is the crowning jewel. They both offer insight into the making of the film. One neat tidbit from the commentary is when Clark states that Jack Nicholson was his original choice to play the dad. Upon viewing this treasure ""A Christmas Story"" will become a part of your Holiday viewing pleasure for years to come."	5.0	"""A True Classic"""	2010-01-22	0	0	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	ASQTU5QZ8AYNA	"T. Harmer ""mad_movie_fan"""	"A Christmas Story is one of my favorite movies to watch on Christmas, I really can't see getting through Christmas without watching the Marathan that TNT shows every year, which is a good thing. It's hard to believe it's been 20 years since it's release, how fast time goes by. It's a film with with a very special meaning to it, it made me feel when I was a child excited and thrilled to wake up Christmas Morning and find my favorite Christmas present. Even though the DVD looks great, I wouldn't buy this movie, simply because of the fact that the only time I watch is during Christmas, it's one of the films I think that's better left that way, watch only one time a year, but that's not to say it's not worth your money, because it is, I'm sure of it. If you've watched this film as much as I have, you begin to appreciate it's plot and happy ending, you feel happy & emotional for Ralpy and you begin to think of yourself & your own family, and when you've watched it as many times as I have, you understand why it's a classic and why you cannot go through one Christmas without seeing it. Ya know Christmas can be the most dreadful time of the year for many people, because of the shopping, travel, and money you have to spend, but the one thing keeps it positive for me is watching ""A Christmas Story"" on Christmas Eve with the tree light blinking, the presents under the tree, just lying in the recliner all night long, eating lasagna & meatball sandwiches (that's what's cooked up every XMAS at my house), and enjoying a 24 hour marathon of my favorite christmas movie. It really don't get any better than that for me. :-)MMF"	5.0	An Epic Classic on XMAS	2003-12-17	3	1	2

So I didn't see it.  I've heard of bad marketing moves, but I still couldn't understand that one.Years later, I kept hearing what a wonderfully funny holiday movie this was and checked it out.  Now it's a holiday tradition to see it every Christmas.  It's that good.  I admire it for capturing the 1940's look while at the same time tapping into the universal thoughts and feelings of &quot;Kid-dom.&quot;It's Christmas Eve, I've just watched it, and I laughed out loud all over again.(My only problem with the Special Edition is that I would've loved to have heard from Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon.

The main focus of the movie is what I just explained to you above, but their is much more to this charming movie.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	ABLBRUT8DALNN	Todd Smith	How many times do you watch it on Christmas? This movie certainly is a classic. I'm a sucker for flashback films told by a narrator and this is perhaps a primary example of these films. For those of you living under a rock and unfamiliar with this film, it's about a little boy named Ralphie and what he wants for Christmas. The cast is fantastic and it's hilarious without being raunchy. This is how comedies used to be and some would argue should be. No doubt this film is great, but what most people don't know is that there is actually a sequel, with the same narrator, made 11 years later. My Summer Story follows Ralphie and his family the following summer and while the cast is different, the story is equally as good. I'd suggest you check out both films and be careful not to shoot your eye out kid!	4.0	The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078	2013-02-23	0	0	0

There was only one thing that I was disappointed about was not getting the leg lamp lights with it. I wanted all of it (the apron, cookbook, cookie cutters, dvd) including the lights. The only way to get that with this anniversary set is to buy the blu-ray version but all you get in it are the lights.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1CAA94EOP0J2S	Travis J Smith	This movie is the story of a little kid who sets his eyes on one special Christmas gift: a Red Rider BB Gun. It details the days leading up to Christmas day as he tries to convince everyone else that he won't 'shoot his eye out'.It is a funny, wonderful movie. This is one of those movies you can watch over and over and over again - you'll laugh as hard the 100th time you see it as you did the 1st time. It is timeless - I remember watching it as a kid, thinking it was made in the 60s. It is good for the entire family from kids to adults. Even though it comes on TV multiple times a season, it's worth buying the DVD to watch it whenever you want. An amusing fact is that the director, Bob Clark, also is responsible for movies like 'Rhinestone' and 'Porkys'.Like another reviewer, I was disappointed a bit in the lack of special features on the DVD (I think the studios do this with all DVDs on purpose so they repackage movies as special editions every few years).	5.0	Timeless Classic	2002-10-24	3	3	0

His all American face and calm demeanor is hard to forget on a 10 year old.Wasn't until years later I accidentally tuned in to this movie on tv.  I recognized his face and the whole atmosphere of the movie drew me in.Two of the BEST scenes is when he finally reaches Santa and gets tongue tied. Before sliding down the exit, he crawls back up the ramp to express to Santa that he wants the Red Rider BB gun...followed by a big grin to boot!  His expression of ""Santa screwed me!"" when he replies, ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid."" is hysterical!Then the Chinese restaurant scene of the help slowly singing, ""T'is the season to be ""ja-ree"". fa-ra-ra, ra-ra, ra-ra ra-ra"".

That's Right, He wants so bad, But His Parents, Teacher, and Good 'ol St. Nick Himself warns Ralphie Not to get it in this little slice of Americana directed by Bob Clark(Porky's). There are so many memorable scenes but my favorites were Ralphie's little brother gets his tongue stuck on the flagpole; Ralphie gets into a fight the School Bully Scott Farkus, and my best scene was Ralphie and Randy goes upstairs to meet Santa Hhimself-They started at the front of the line-But the line Began in THE other direction.The sore was about to close, and Santa was in a big hurry-Thanks to his Angry Elves(C'mon Kid-Hurry UP!) When Ralphie's mind went blank, Santa asked how about a nice football? Then Ralphie was pusheddown to the slide, and fell down into a pile of shaving cream.

It wasn't until the movie started airing on televsion and cable that people found out how great a movie A CHRISTMAS STORY is. Since then, the movie has become a piece of our American heritage, a part of the pop culture paradigm, and (like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE) a Christmas classic.The film revolves around nine-year-old Ralphie whose only wish for Christmas is to own a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot Carbine Action BB gun. However, everyone from his mother to his teacher to Santa Claus himself tells him it's too dangerous and that ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid."" Along the way, Ralphie and his friends and family get involved in all sorts of comic mishaps. However, in the end everything turns out alright and everyone has a merry Christmas.The movie is full of hilarious heartfelt nostalgia. Anyone who has ever been part of a family or from a rural (in mindset) town will enjoy watching this film again and again. Recommended for viewing at least once a year.

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2X4PCABYYDD94	tychoryan	Regardless of how it gets played on endless repeat on Christmas day, I still can't comprehend when people tell me they hate this movie. HOW CAN ANYONE DISLIKE THIS FILM? In my opinion, A Christmas Story perfectly captures the perspective of Christmas from the average child with hilarious results. And the &#34;true stories&#34; from the screenwriter's childhood have become classic gags. The leg lamp, the evil mall Santa, getting caught saying the F word by parents, the Bumpus' dogs, and sticking your toungue to a frozen pole are such classic material that I still laugh each time I see them to this day.On the video quality front, the BluRay is just okay. It's certainly the best this film has ever looked on home video, but you won't find anything crazy-go-nuts in terms of visual quality. Luckily, the disc is cheap enough to be worth the money if you dont already have it on DVD.	4.0	My favorite Christmas movie has an okay Blu-Ray	2012-12-11	2	0	2

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2DJFYBB2L5VSN	UniversityDoc	My spouse loves this film and so do I. The film is set during the World War II. It is about a little boy named Ralphie and is quest for the &#34;greatest Christmas gift of all time: the Red Ryder BB gun&#34; and how he goes about trying to get it for Christmas. It is funny, heartwarming and just plain Christmas. The only part I dodn't care for are Ralphi's daydreams. Hence, the four stars. Other that that, this is a great film to watch any time of year, with or without your family, especially if you need a pick me up. This is an excellent film at Christmas time and I have no hesitation recommending it.

In this story, Ralphie, who is 9 years old, must convince his parents and teacher what the perfect gift for christmas is. At first, he hesitates, and when he asks, its always the same answer: ""Oh, no. you'll shoot you're eye out!"" Raphie stops at nothing to get what he wants. He would not even listen to the teacher when she gave him a C on his ""what i want for christmas"" paper and told him it's a bad idea. He didnt even listen to who he thought was the real santa.The funniest scenes in this movie are :1. when ralphie and his friends get chased by 2 bullies2. when his father gets a lamp shaped like a leg and ralphie's mother ""accidentally"" breaks it,3. when the dogs next door take the dinner turkey4. when raphie find out what the little orphan annie code was only a commercial for ovaltine5. when ralphie gets soap put in his mouth when he says the F-dash-dash-dash word(it is censored by fudge)6. when santa pushes him down the slide of doom.My whole family always said, ""it isnt Christmas without watching this movie"".

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A2KZDYSKJ62FQN	"Vickie R. Terhune ""James"""	To get into the holiday spirit this year, I wanted to find a VHS copy of this movie (VHS would've suited me fine), but I was a bit miffed when I couldn't find a copy at Wal-Mart.  But then my mom went shopping (at Wal-Mart) last Saturday (Nov. 29) and, to my slight surprise, came home with--&quot;consider this your final Christmas present&quot;--a copy of this Special Edition DVD.  (For a long time, as sort of a Christmas tradition, my family and I relied on our television-broadcast-VHS-taped version of the movie, with dated commercials, poor picture and all.)  Though I initially wasn't intrigued by the re-release of this movie, since &quot;Santa&quot; gave &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; to me early, I thought, Cool, with a shrug.I have a 27-inch TV (fairly cheap, no-frills Sylvania model, with its picture settings unchanged, conveying overall-acceptable visuals), which uses composite video (unfortunately, that's all the set has).  Since the DVD offers both full-frame and widescreen, I chose full-frame.  Video-wise, the new digital transfer of the movie to DVD is very good.  Audio-wise, I was disappointed that the transfer offers only Dolby Digital mono (1-channel), which played mainly through my center speaker (Yamaha NSA-C143).  There is a running audio commentary from director Bob Clark and Peter Billingsley (&quot;Ralphie&quot;), which I didn't listen to.  Also, there are multi-lingual subtitles and a French soundtrack, for viewers who like those sort of things.Overall-quality-wise, I feel that &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; recieved a decent restoration treatment for DVD.  (The next time I watch the movie, I'll switch to widescreen, the aspect ratio of 1.85:1--and I may listen to the audio commentary, though I'll probably leave the subtitles off.)After I watched the movie disc, I switched to the other DVD.  I then realized why this &quot;Special Edition&quot; wasn't priced much higher than the earlier single-DVD release (about $19 compared to $15 or so)--the &quot;20th Anniversary Extras&quot; disc isn't overly-loaded with material and what's available is somewhat silly and non-essential.  I was assuming there would be a &quot;making-of&quot; featurette with behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with all of the cast members, not just a few (including the director).  But what is included in the second disc, while it technically is bonus material, could've been better.  The longest piece &quot;Another Christmas Story&quot; is only about eighteen minutes long; and I wasn't too thrilled about the trivia games; and the &quot;Get A Leg Up&quot; making of the infamous leg lamp was pretty dumb; and although its historical documentary was interesting, I never desired to have a Red Ryder BB gun when I was a child; and there are a couple other things that may intrigue some people but didn't me.Yet, I'm glad to finally have this movie, despite the fact that I didn't plan to add &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; to my DVD collection.  But since I didn't buy this &quot;Special Edition&quot; re-release, I won't complain about it--because you shouldn't overly criticise a gift DVD for its negative attributes.  From a &quot;Special Edition&quot; dual-disc set I guess I expected more--but at least the re-release is a good-looking version of a classic holiday motion picture.All in all, for the movie itself, the new version of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is pretty much worth the price.  I do recommend it.	4.0	This re-release isn't bad , though it could've been better	2003-12-02	2	0	2

The story of Ralphie, the boy who only wants an official Red Ryder BB gun, but everyone in the world is trying to cut down his dreams. Every charecter in this movie is hillarious, right down to Santa and his elves. ""You'll shoot your eye out kid. Ok, lets get him out of here..oh HOH! HOH! HO-O-O-OH!"""	5.0	A FOOTBALL?

All the &quot;cursing&quot; done by the dad is gibberish meant to represent  profanity, but it's not real.  That's why it's funny.  And then there's the  tire-changing incident, which is a humorous send-up of profanity in the  home.  Lighten up, folks.  This movie rocks.	5.0	Great Christmas movie	2000-01-05	1	1	0

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	AKP8KN7O8XIH1	W. Gervasi	This movie is a true classic.  The characters are eternally memorable from the dazed lead character Ralphie to the bully Farkus, from smart a$$ed friend Flick to the witchy school marm (can you imagine giving an a homework assignment during Christmas season?), and of course anyone who has raised kids can appreciate the bedraggled parents of Ralphie and his kid brother Randy who desperately attempt to survive the holiday season.There are classic memorable scenes as well, including dinner in a Chinese restaurant with waiters attempting to sing Christmas carols in broken English.  I can no longer hear &#34;ho ho ho!&#34; without hearing in my head the way that the Santa in A Christmas Story says it.This movie is a must-see in my house every year.

My family said people like it because it reminds people who were kids in the 50's and 60's of their childhoods.  I personally found it depressing because of the appearing parental apathy and the insensitive way in which the children were treated.  I laughed at a couple of parts, but overall I will not watch this movie again and prefer something that promotes love and cheer.	1.0	I know this is a classic but...	2012-12-09	15	2	13

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A295P2KZIWUAWI	"W. Langan ""take403"""	"Jean Shepherd's classic A Christmas Story was not a big hit when it was released to theatres in 1983 (in fact, I don't remember any advertisement of it that Christmas).  However, thanks to Jean Shepherd's narration and story telling and Peter Billingsley's performance of the shy and scheming Ralphie, who wants a Red Ryder BB gun more than anything else in the world, it's become a cult classic (shown ad nauseum on a certain Cable TV station).  When my father 1st saw it on video, he was amazed at how much the father (sometimes grumpy, sometimes flamboyant, but always respected- or else) reminded him of himself (what real life father couldn't relate to a man whose obscenities flew over Lake Erie for years?).  The mother is a lot like my own, except for the ""Pretend you're a piggie and this is your trough!"" scene which my mother certainly wouldn't have tolerated!  Ralphie, of course, reminds me of myself.  Although I never asked for a Red Ryder, there were plenty of other presents Santa had to bring or it just wasn't Christmas!  Scut Farkus is pretty real, too, as the menacing bully, as well as the no-nonsense teacher (""Those of you who put Flick up to this know who you are and I'm sure you feel terrible!"") and the Bumpus neighbors' annoying dogs (one gets their tail caught in the door but they get their revenge!).  Ralphie's kid brother is realistically whiney: ""I can't move!""  Then there's Ralphie's buddies, the conniving Schwartz and the hapless Flick, whose double dog dare acceptance gets him in big trouble!  The fantasy sequences are quite amusing!  Which brings me back to the BB gun- Ralphie makes his request known to his mother and his teacher (""You'll shoot your eye out!"") and finally hopes Santa can bail him out, despite an attitude bigger than his belly and 2 ornery elves helping not so jolly Santa at Higbee's department store!As for the extras, there's a commentary on the movie with the producer and Peter Billingsley (5 stars, you learn that Jean Shepherd has a cameo in the movie).  There's an advertisement for the Red Ryder BB Gun (3 stars).  There's a corny advertisement for the leg lamp (1 star, see it only once if you must).  There's a Where Are They Now? sequence featuring Schwartz, Scut Farkus, Flick and Ralphie (5 stars, the childhood actors still look like they did as kids; since Jean Shepherd and Ralphie's father passed away, they're not featured).  Also, there are 2 short stories as read by Jean Shepherd (4 stars, if you can sit through them, but don't hit the buttons on your remote control while the story is being read or you'll go right back to the beginning of the story)."	5.0	"""Ok, Black Bart, now you'll get yours!"""	2003-12-21	3	2	1

6301966554	A Christmas Story [VHS]	A1XG1UX06Z5QBM	"W. Stephens ""Seasoned Bookman"""	For those of us who grew up in the forties and fifties Christmas Story is a wonderful opportunity to travel back to the tinsel-ridden, overloaded-electrical-socket, turkey-roasting Christmases of our youth. Nor will anyone who ever owned a Red Rider BB gun ever forget what a wonderful, liberating tool they were, capable of protecting backyard campers throughout the deepest, darkest nights, and whiling away whatever idle hour might unexpectedly turn up. People who grew up with televisions in the corner of their living room (or worse! in their own bedroom!) will never be able to truly appreciate what the miracle of radio drama meant to us kids in the days before glowing phosphors dominated the world of entertainment. But if they're the slightest bit interested in what it was like to grow up in that ancient time, they could have no better guide to that experience in this film: the costumes, the cars, the family seated around the radio, the teetering Christmas tree, the trip downtown to the big department store, it's all here for you, the good and bad of growing up back then. An indispensable shot of Christmas memories for us oldsters, a massive dose of charm for those too young to remember, &#34;A Christmas Story&#34; has become an iconic part of the Christmas season for all ages.	5.0	A Christmas Time Machine	2013-11-02	1	1	0

If you're like me, you can relate to Ralphie and always wanting that bb gun when you were little.

I  love it's more down-to-earth look at the yuletide season, showing the  shortcomings as well as the virtues. And what better viewpoint to see it  from than that of a ten-year-old with high hopes?Sure it's set in the  late 40's, but it does have many elements of timelessness. Things like  taking stupid dares at recess. Facing down the overbearing schoolyard  bully. Those endless hints about what you want for XMas- just to be  somewhat discouraged by your parent's less-than-enthusiastic reaction.  Formulating a foolproof plan to get exactly what you want on that magical  day. That god-awful get-up that your distant (But apparently not distant  enough) aunt sent you that your folks make you put on so they can take  Holiday pictures. Learning the art of cussin' from your dad's mad tirades  of indignation. It's those little moments in the film and in life that most  of us recall from our childhood days in mid-December.Christmas time has  never been this brutal.. or this funny.
