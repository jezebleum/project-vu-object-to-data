079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A155X6KYOPQEZ5	"#1 Cardinal Fan ""Afe"""	Uncle Eddy and Clark W. Griswald are back in National Lampoom's Christmas Vacation. I personally think this one is the best of all the Lampoom's movies. Clark and his family are preparing for a great Christmas together with their parents when Uncle Eddy and his family unexpectantly arrive. From their everything goes downhill for Clark. (again) Hilarious movie, but does unfortunately have some language to it. (I won't write any examples) But overall this movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen. I highly recommend it for any National Lampoom fan!	5.0	Hilarious Movie!	2008-06-17	0	0	0

It is a yearly family tradition to watch it. There is side splitting laughter accompanied by lots of holiday traditions with a twist. Chevy Chase as well as all the other actors turn in all star performances.	5.0	Christmas Vacation a Must For Serious Lovers of Holiday Movies	2013-11-08	2	1	1

I have always enjoyed the Vacation series and this is one of my favorites. I am glad it has staying power and is aired regularly and available for streaming even today. The film is not a side splitter but offers some light hearted laughs and is very relatable for adults with in-laws, children and annoying neighbors.	5.0	A classic (sorry Baby Boomers).

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A22AD8M2SSOFHJ	"A. C. Ege/Acedoh ""acedoh"""	Now I doubt many of you who read this review have not seen this movie.  I also would think many of you who have watched it probably have it on DVD.  So let me save some people from having to read on.  If you have this movie on DVD should you buy it? Probably not for $20 but if you have yet to get this movie the Blu-ray option is an excellent choice.The story features all the favorite actors like Chevy Chase, Beverly DiAngelo and Randy Quaid.  Clark Griswald played by Chevy Chase just wants to have a normal traditional Christmas.  Of course when it's a National Lampoons Christmas everything is far from ordinary.  The comedy in this movie is non-stop.  From the crazy antics of Clark to Randy Quaids outstanding outlandish performance as the red neck with his crazy family.Now as many have rated the Blu-ray version I am here to say it really looks decent.  Not excellent.  The picture is clear and much improved from the DVD version.  The sound is decent and played thru all my five speakers.  Like I said earlier if you already have this on DVD your best bet is to stick with it.  Otherwise this is a great addition to anyones Christmas collection.	5.0	A Humorous Christmas Story	2007-12-25	1	1	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is one of my favorite holiday films. Clark, Ellen, Rusty, Audrey, and Cousin Eddie are back but this is nothing like the disapointing sequel, European Vacation (that movie was awful), this time the Griswold's decide to stay home and celebrate Christmas the good old fashioned-way. Both of their parents arrive and unexpected guest causes mayhem for The Griswold's, yikes! Cousin Eddie, played geniusly by Randy Quaid. The last hour of the film is non-stop laughs. The perfect holiday movie, I highly recommend the yultide gathering of mishaps and complete fun.	5.0	"""Oh dear, did I break wind?"""	2006-06-26	1	1	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3Q77CS1DEQLMG	Alessandro Bruno	I appreciate all the National lampoon films; however, Christmas Vacation is in a class by itself.  I think it's Chevy Chase's best film (and I like Chevy Chase).  Like other veryu effective comedies, this one has hidden or subtle jokes that make it easy to watch over and over.  Apart from the big laughs that come at the expense of Clarke's brother in law, the tree falling into the neighbor's house and the black-out that results from Clarke's ambitious tree lighting set-up, I find the best moments when Clakrke loses his temper after discovering that his bonus has been revoked from the chain saw home improvements scene - would make Bob Vila proud - to the danny kaye exclamation.  The funniest, however, is when he re-arranges rudolph the reindeer after he can't get the lights on.  It's funny because it's very real.  how many of us - even as children - have gotten angry at inanimate objects for our mistakes?  remeber being frustrated at a mecano set or the lego piece that just would not fit?Unfortunately, nothing has surpassed this christmas comedy, and I can only think of one funnier movie: Dumb and Dumber.	5.0	Fixed the stairpost!	2001-12-02	2	1	1
079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1TUZL12O7X1A9	Alexander G.	Quite simply put this is one of the MUST WATCH Christmas movies. If you have any sort of DVD/blu-ray collection, this is one of those MUST HAVES for your collection.Its a movie you can watch all year round! Kids to Adults will love this movie. They honestly just don't make comedies like this anymore. Its wholesome yet has plenty of &#34;adult&#34; humor in it to appeal to the masses.Christmas Vacation runs the gammet of emotions. Laughter to crying. There are even a few tense.. **Scary** moments. Like when the door bell rings and the family is at the door. Most of us can attest to the horrors of having family over for Christmas. And that first nock at the door or doorbell ring send a horrific chill through your spine. And though many of us dread certain family members, we forge ahead in the spirit of the season and tolerate the often UN-tolerable in our family.This movie is A+ in my book.	5.0	Hilarious!	2013-08-22	0	0	0

This is a VERY funny 80s-tastic movie that will make you feel much better about any holiday troubles that you may be having. I imagine that the writers wrote the initial story line and then sat around and said, &#34;Well, what else could go wrong? Let's add that in. Now let's one-up that.&#34; *writers laugh*Good for a holiday laugh, although it does have some swearing so I would not recommend it for young children.	5.0	Classic Chevy Chase	2013-12-17	1	0	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A380S0FSWNY6QK	Amazon Customer	I'm all for silly movies, especially holiday themed ones that are just plain goofy.  But the scene where Clark lies to the sexy mall clerk, saying he's divorced, as he drools over her breasts... then his son walks up as he literally looking up the woman's thigh and picking up on her.  C'mon. That's not funny, that's sad.  And later Clark fantasizes over this same woman (we get the view of him visualizing her showing up) at his new backyard pool and we get to see a very revealing strip tease?  How is this family-friendly comedy? The pool scene really crossed the line. If this were'nt a movie for kids and family I wouldn't care, but how can you target that audience and then show scenes like that? Very poor taste in my opinion.	1.0	Watch out for soft porn.  :o(	2012-12-16	20	2	18

Well, only moments ago I just recieved a confirmation on a SPECIAL EDITION release of ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" which will contain a nice new anamorphic widescreen transfer, as well as commentary by Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, et al.So, at long last a holiday tradition is getting the treatment it deserves.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1853EEJYVWG4E	ATJ	This is one of the few movies that I have laughed uncontrollably at.  The film immediately gives the viewer a taste of what is to come later when the family is first searching for the &quot;Griswold Family Christmas Tree&quot; out in a rural setting.  The family, in their beat up station wagon, gets harassed by a couple of rednecks who end up playing chicken on the road with Clark, the father (Chase).  As the movie progresses towards the final scenes on Christmas Eve and more family members arrive, the scenes become more outrageous, like the issues that rise when both sets of grandparents arrive or the measures Clark takes to decorate the house with Christmas lights. When he finally succeeds in lighting the house, the movie shifts into a different gear when Ellen, Clark's wife's (D'Angelo) cousin Eddie (Quaid) and his family arrives on the scene via a barely running RV with their rottweiler dog that is aptly named for a body condition.  The film is stuck in high gear after this, as scenes become more disastrous and hilarious.  The Christmas Eve dinner features the entire family along with Clark's Aunt Bethany and Uncle Lewis and their senile demeanors.  Random scenes like the dog &quot;yakkin' on a bone&quot; during dinner or Bethany's house cat mistakenly wrapped up as a Christmas present add to the hilarity. The movie ends when Clark finds out that he has been shafted by his boss and Cousin Eddie decides to do something about it.  A great holiday classic with many more random, funny scenes not mentioned in this review.	5.0	One of the greatest comedies ever...	2001-04-28	1	1	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1PASRZ81DY9C	Austin Somlo	Viewed: 11/03, 5/06, 6/11Rate: 85/06: Wildly unusual and perfect for the holiday taste, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a delightfully uproarious comedy picture. Chevy Chase may not have been a good comedian, but this film is where he strikes gold the best. I felt that Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is a more sophisticated work than National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, but the latter works so well enough that it is passed as a genuine Christmas movie in the likes of It's a Wonderful Life. Everything about National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is enriched with familial values. Usually, there would be slew of films being so offensively gross or rancor complemented with ribald humor, but not this one...this is as good as it gets. A lot of wacky, zany moments lurks all over this film. Even though the fact I have seen National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation a zillion times, it never gets old or outdated. It's still one of the best comedies around. There's a great character out of Eddie, played wonderfully by Randy Quaid, who is a gifted comedy actor. Any film that has National Lampoon's in its title is guaranteed to be very bad, but luckily, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is the only one that remains the best of the breed.6/11: When National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation came out in video, it quickly became a mandatory viewing every Christmas season just like how It's a Wonderful Life was. I couldn't forget how so funny the movie was; the wild moments, the zany antics, the sad-but-true incidents, and the hilarious lines. Of all National Lampoon movies, this Christmas one is the only one worth mentioning. Chevy Chase, while a very much an iconic comedy but sometimes funny actor of 80's, delivered the best performance of his career; he just nailed everything just perfect. I could never forget the insane moments: the crash landing into tree lot parking area, the dug out tree, the Jason hockey mask, the sap stickiness, the 25,000 lights plus the drum roll, the slippery surfaced toboggan, the unloading of RV toilet, the 9 lives spent, the burnt tree, the squirrel, the Jelly-of-the-Month club and the aftermath description of the boss, and Ellen's crotch protection. All in all, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a time honored Christmas classic and will always remain the second greatest Christmas picture made.	4.0	An Enduring Holiday Tradition to Watch Since 1989.	2011-06-12	1	1	0

Viewing this film is a great way to relieve tension during the holiday season.  With his usual enthusiasm Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) sets out to have a fun old-fashioned family Christmas in this sequel to the Vacation movies.  Cousin Eddie once again played by Dennis Quaid does his part to help.  Beverly D'Angelo is back as Ellen, Clark's wife, who struggles to make everything work smoothly.  In true National Lampoon style this film is a funny look at family traditions and holiday events.  With a house full of relatives, decorations and animals the Griswolds once again turn the magic of the moment into a hilarious situation.	5.0	Christmas - Griswold style	2004-01-31	0	0	0

I purchased this after not watching it for many, many years and I was so dissappointed in it that I have not watched it since. It was a total waste of time and money for me. It contains foul language which in my opinion ranges from moderate to offensive, with the ""F"" word being used and there are some sexually oriented scenes which in my opinion are innappropriate. There is also a cat that gets electrocuted. I am listing the issues I have with this movies so that anyone else who is considering purchasing it as a family film or anyone who might possibly be offended by its contents will know what they are getting. I wish I had done some reading before I had purchased- it would have saved me some money. Now- with that being said- this is my review and my opinion of the movie.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A11YV6VC51HJTV	"Blake Petit ""Novelist, columnist & reviewer"""	&quot;National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation&quot; is one of those real gems -- you get one every five or ten years, a Christmas movie that defines that moment in time and becomes a holiday favorite like &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; and &quot;A Christms Story&quot; before it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprise their roles from the previous two &quot;Vacation&quot; movies and decide this time to stay home and have an old-fashioned family Christmas. This would not be the Griswold family, of course, if everything didn't go wrong.The only thing disappointing about this DVD set is that Warner Brothers has the nerve to label it a &quot;Special Edition.&quot; While it's certainly a step up from the barebones fullscreen DVD released a couple of years ago, there's still not much here. The only special features are the trailer and a commentary track that doesn't even include Chevy Chase. (C'mon, what's he got to do these days that he's too busy to record a commentary?) This would be an okay DVD release, but it's certainly not &quot;special.&quot; Still, it's likely to be the best we'll get, and since I avoided the previous release, I picked this one up because I do love the movie.	4.0	Great movie, a not-so-special &quot;Special Edition.&quot;	2003-12-23	5	4	1

Chevy Chase is HILARIOUS and his ability to dead-pan is perfect; Julia Louis-Dreyfuss in an early role is a scene-stealer and shows some of the talent that would become evident in her TV career, which has netted her multiple Emmy's and countless accolades. I can't think of one scene that doesn't have me laughing hysterically. It is a true classic.	5.0	A Christmas Classic	2012-12-25	1	0	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2K3RSOH1HM6H7	"Bowman ""9001"""	As I began to write this, mulling over my thoughts, I noticed a recent negative reviewer who has issues with this films vulgarity and (lack of)morality. We are all entitled to our opinions. Personally I find the series &#34;Doc Martin&#34; to be incredibly irritating and if I was a braver man I would write that heretical review and incur the ensuing tidal wave of fan wrath.I decided to go back to the beginning of December and look over what has been said since. In the last 10 days there have been 82 new reviews, 2 upset with video resolution and/or packaging, and 3 unhappy with the actual content of this movie, and 1 person who is on the fence. That is a 96.0 % approval rating. (3/76 = 0.039 X 100 = 3.94 % disapproval)For me a good story speaks to its generation. A great story speaks to many generations. Look at the 1946 Christmas classic &#34;It's a wonderful Life&#34; and how it has become such a yearly tradition. And for so many of us &#34;National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation&#34; has become one of our traditions.I saw this movie back when it was first released in 1989 not realizing then that it would become such a cultural &#34;fix&#34; that I would need to revisit it each yuletide. On the surface it's a side-splittingly hilarious film. Underneath lays a creative, sarcastic and poignant poke at the (sometimes unwanted) chaos, commercialization and socialization that the holidays can demand.Next year will be this movies 25th anniversary. I will be back again (in tears of laughter) viewing it all the while wondering, why was the sequel so awful, and wishfully thinking that it's not too late to make another?	5.0	"""I'll be outside for the season"""	2013-12-10	1	1	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3P99SK4SPH3KO	Bradford LeHew	"In my opinion, this is the very best of the ""Vacation"" movies from National Lampoon.  Of course, Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as the Griswolds and Randy Quaid is the incorrigible and disgusting Eddie.  This film is a must have in any collection.  You don't see movies where you can laugh out loud throughout the entire thing.  This one is like that.  The Griswolds play host to both sets of inlaws and various other relatives, including a surprise appearance by white-trash paragons Eddie, Katherine, their kids (who are also different in every movie) and their lovely dog, Snots.  Who wouldn't expect everything to go wrong at the Griswold family Christmas?  The only things you don't expect in this mock-up of holiday cheer are the things that happen.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A36AH31X84FIC8	Brent Hilton	from the title you can see i'm alittle disappointed with thisdvd, the problem is that warners did not put enough effort intothis release. so the only thing special about this dvd is the nicely done widescreen transfer of this film, what it lacked was blooper reels, deleted scenes, that's why i rated it four stars & the fact that the sound mix was alittle weak on this dvd , the vhs tape of this film was better , i do wish in the future that warners would make an excellent 5.1. sound mix to update the old pro logic mix not saying it's bad, but it does need to be a little louder . i had to turn the volume to understand what the actors were saying. but besides those things i love this film it's a classic.Highly Recommended.	4.0	Special not sure about that.	2004-12-06	2	1	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"Hands down, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is the best Christmas comedy ever filmed. I make it habit to watch this movie about ten million times between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. Even after seeing the film so many times that I can recite it word-for-word, Christmas Vacation remains as hilarious and entertaining as the previous holiday season. More than just a seasonal film, it's one of those rare comedies that it near perfect from beginning to end.Following the ongoing exploits of Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) and the Griswold family, this particular rendition of the classic Vacation movies is arguably the best. As in the previous films, Clark's goal is to create the perfect vacation for his family. Only this time, instead of hitting the road for Wally World, the Griswolds stay at home in suburban Chicago.Julia Louis-Dreyfus (mere months away from signing on to play Elaine on Seinfeld) makes several appearances as Clark's annoying, yuppie neighbor Margot - a character accompanied by her equally yuppie partner, Todd (Nicholas Guest). Randy Quaid makes a return appearance as Cousin Eddie (playing the same role from the original Vacation film). As Clark's less-cultured relative, Eddie is a man whose ""heart is bigger than his brain"". Beverly D'Angelo also returns in her previous role as Clark's wife, Ellen.When Clark vows to create ""the most fun-filled old-fashioned family Christmas ever,"" things naturally go awry. With the Griswold family and their in-laws living under one roof, the relatives constantly get on each other's nerves. Clark sets out to decorate the house for Christmas, and his quest culminates in a 25,000 light extravaganza that cover every square inch of the house. In the process, he nearly breaks his neck several times and knocks out Todd and Margot's window with a flying lance of roof gutter ice.The laughs multiply several times over when Cousin Eddie arrives uninvited and parks the family RV in the Griswold driveway. He brings his wife Catherine, their two kids Ruby Sue and Rocky, and their lovely dog ""Snots"". The crescendo of disaster steadily increases as Christmas Day approaches with the agony compounded by Clark's failure to receive his annual Christmas bonus. Clark's big Christmas surprise for the family is that he's putting in a pool, but in order to start work as soon as the ground thawed out, he had to put down a hefty deposit which his check won't cover without the Christmas bonus.After a Christmas Eve in which the turkey explodes, Aunt Bethany's cat electrocutes itself, Uncle Lewis burns down the tree, and a squirrel gets loose in the house, a late night knock on the door gives Clark hope. A deliveryman hands him an envelope which fell between the seats - the fabled Christmas bonus.But when the bonus turns out to be a membership in the Jelly-Of-The-Month Club instead of the cash he expected, Clark goes nuts. He extensively curses his boss, Frank Shirley, and tells the family that a nice Christmas gift would be Shirley wrapped in big red bow. Wanting to do something nice for Clark, Cousin Eddie takes the request literally. He kidnaps Mr. Shirley and delivers him to the Griswold house where Mr. Shirley reveals he cut out Christmas bonuses this year. Clark confronts him, and Mr. Shirley agrees that it was the wrong thing to do. He reinstates the bonuses, and tells Clark to add twenty percent. The whole family erupts in celebration, but their Christmas party is soon crashed by a SWAT team which takes the house by siege.Originally released in 1989, Christmas Vacation has surprisingly little content that makes it look ""dated"". As such, it's certain to be a holiday viewing tradition for generations to come...The DVD Report"	5.0	The number one Christmas comedy ever!	2005-04-19	0	0	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A15JDXDBUWBQI3	Carlos Spiceyweiner	My wife and I just received this in the mail on Friday. I have read a lot of reviews about the quality and sound of the movie and my two cents worth is, yes you really cant tell a big difference in the quality but there is a difference. There is a little more depth in the blu-ray than on the regular dvd. I loved all the little trinkets that came with the blu-ray!!!!!! Some people complained that they were crappy and cheap, well what do you expect for something that costs less than $40. If you wanted high dollar memorabilia then maybe you should try an auction instead of a mass produced blu-ray tin!!

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3N95R1VKWROWF	Christopher Schwinger	I already know most will disagree with me, but I write this for those small few who would benefit.  I hoped to find this movie enjoyably funny and whimsical, but the comedy felt so cheap to me.  The script was filled with profanity, and although I recognize Chevy Chase's comedic skill, I must disparage how he uses it in this movie.  I feel good comedy requires more than goofy faces, reckless decisions with physical accidents, extreme blowups and makeups, and wacky characters.  I saw it in the last 12 months and thought back on it this Christmas season (Dec 2013 and Jan 2014), and I realized that my mind has forgotten a lot of its silly incidents because I didn't find them funny when I saw it.  Too much farcical comedy becomes tiring because you can predict that EVERYTHING goes wrong.  (Google defines farce as &#34;typically including crude characterization and ludicrously improbable situations&#34;.)  Another Chevy Chase movie called Funny Farm, from the year before this, 1988, seems a lot more creativity written and creates a lot more human interest, partly because its plot and humor don't depend so heavily on idiotic physical accidents, which is this movie's main source of humor.Besides that everything goes wrong so that there was no sense of surprise for me anymore, Chevy Chase&#8217;s character is too much of an idiot to be a character I could sympathize with, and yet the viewer is supposed to laugh at him while really sympathizing with him.  I could only be mildly amused at how dumb he is, but not really care about him like the sentimental moments in the movie want you to.  He needed to be a bit less of an idiot to make me care enough about him to keep following the movie with interest.And it's not that I don't like a blundering protagonist, but he took it to an extreme.  This movie is like if a Three Stooges short became a long movie and there were no side characters to distract attention from their nonstop physical humor.  (The Three Stooges movies had important side characters, by the way, and I think that was necessary to make their comedy palatable for so many minutes at a time.)  And like the Three Stooges, Chevy Chase's &#34;Clark Griswold&#34; doesn't seem that affected by the consequences of his own dumb actions--at least not long-term.  The Bible has a proverb about a fool repeating his folly like a dog returning to his vomit, and that is not an exaggeration of how I think of the Clark Griswold character!  He never learns to prevent mistakes, just keeps making 'em over and over in slightly different ways.  I think the reason it doesn't work well in this movie, while it works with the Three Stooges, is that you're not supposed to like the Three Stooges in any sentimental way like you're supposed to like Clark Griswold.  And the endpoint for a Three Stooges story is never anything substantial like having a blessed family Christmas.I didn't like the Home Alone movies for the same reason as National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, because of the overreliance on physical disasters to create humor.  But although this was a little funnier to me than Home Alone, I would have kept this one and tried it again at some point if it didn't have so much profanity and occasional sexual humor.  But I'm sure that even if the crud wasn't in it, I still wouldn't find it that funny, because of the overly idiotic character of Clark Griswold.I think the only two times I enjoyed the physical comedy on it (which is the majority of the comedic touches) were when he was going to the extreme in setting up Christmas lights outside his house and when he got stuck in his attic, and I didn't even enjoy it when he fell through his attic's loose floorboard.  I still don't get why it's supposed to be funny when people get physically injured in entertainment, because no one would find it amusing if that actually happened.  It has a little more appeal to me in some cartoons when it's a consequence of stupidity by characters like Donald Duck, Elmer Fudd, or Daffy Duck, none of whom you're supposed to care about usually.  But you ARE supposed to care about Chevy Chase's Clark Griswold character, and a cartoon is nowhere near as long as this movie.  One of the top-ranked Amazon reviews of this movie says it's the best of the 4 National Lampoon's Chevy Chase movies, all of which have the same Clark Griswold character.  If that's true, I can't imagine how much I'd dislike the others!	2.0	Didn't find it very funny - humor overrelies on stupid antics & physical disasters w/ an idiotic protagonist; too much profanity	2014-01-18	0	0	0

This is one of my favourite Christmas movies.It's all about a Father, who wants his family to have the perfect family Christmas - but like everybody, he's not perfect.. and he causes some major problems.It has all you need in a good Seasonal film. Humour, morals (come on, the ending had something) and the ability to make you really excited about Christmas, especially if it's close.I only saw it for the first time last year - but I watch it quite a lot. It's one of those films which are addictive. You watch it once and you watch it again and again and again.It's a real Christmas classic for me.Just a warning though: It's not your average Christmas film. There's some rude words and suggestions in it. Thing is though, I think it's been edited for the UK.. because something that has been described in the movie wasn't on my DVD.10/10 - Great Seasonal Comedy	5.0	Classic Christmas Comedy	2005-05-10	2	1	1

Even my low budget DVD player has the option of forcing a widescreen movie (16:9 aspect) to fit my 4:3 TV screen, so what sense is there in not releasing the DVD in widescreen?Even if the producers felt that this film was not worthy of widescreen, or that some views would have trouble with player options, then at least distribute it as a double-sided (wide/full) DVD.

It's a good family comedy movie that gets everyone in a good mood.  Chevy Chase does an awesome job as the lead character and Randy Quaid as the unwelcome family member is always a great twist.  The Griswalds just want a great all American family Christmas with the entire family present and enjoying each other.

From an unexpected visit from his cousin-in-law Eddie (Randy Quaid in a show-stealing performance) to an overpacked (and over-lit) house, there seems to be problems at every corner for the Griswold clan. If you're looking for a hilarious Christmas movie, this is one of the very best that there is. This ""Special Edition"" is a bit light on bonus features. There is an audio commentary with the cast and crew (no Chevy Chase or Juliette Lewis though) and the original trailer.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	"All too often, I have found the words ""National Lampoon's"" to be synonymous with ""not funny,"" but National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is actually a pretty entertaining film.  Christmas at the Griswold's turns out just like you would expect it to, with Clark (Chevy Chase) trying to persevere in the face of one disaster after another.  With the whole family coming over, he wants everything to be perfect - from the Christmas tree he finds and cuts down (er, digs up) himself to the thousands of lights he staples all over the house.  He's not completely stupid, though - he knows his parents and his wife's parents are going to argue throughout the holidays, that his wife and kids aren't all that excited about sharing Christmas with the rest of the family, and that Aunt Bethany couldn't get back in the loop even if she knew where to find it, but he's determined to make this the best Christmas ever.Of course, there are a few things Clarke wasn't counting on: countless problems getting all the decorations up and working, the unexpected arrival of cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his backwater brood in their junky RV, or the unwelcome visits of the aptly-named Snots the dog and a special Christmas squirrel.  Then, of course, there's the cat-related tragedy, the Christmas bonus bugaboo, and that whole police raid.The filmmakers brought together a really good cast for this film.  Beverly D'Angelo is Clarke's perfectly understanding wife, while Johnny Galecki and a young Juliette Lewis play the long-suffering Griswold kids.  The in-laws include Doris Roberts and E.G. Marshall, while Randy Quaid is perfectly cast as crude cousin Eddie.  You even have Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a neighborly victim of all the Griswold Christmas cheer and yet another SNL alum, Brian Doyle-Murray, as Clarke's boss at work.  With John Hughes, who could almost do no wrong back in the 1980s providing the script, it makes for a pretty simple recipe for comedic success.This movie never managed to make me laugh out loud, but it is consistently amusing and entertaining.  It's not like you could pack any secret laughter bombs the audience would never see coming because the audience knows exactly what kind of slapstick humor to expect.  Still, it's the simple things, such as Aunt Bethany's blessing of Christmas dinner, that prove to be the funniest.  I might also add that the gross-out humor is kept to something of a minimum, thank goodness.  I won't be making this film a part of my annual Christmas tradition by any means, but it's certainly worth one viewing."	4.0	Just your typical Griswold Christmas celebration/disaster	2006-12-22	1	0	1

Chevy Chase was near the end, but still in his &#34;power curve&#34;. Bev DiAngelo is awesome & Juliet Lewis' teenage performance was a window into great things to come. You also get fire, explosions & the humiliation of the two most hellish yuppies ever put on screen. Though I rented it, we will end up buying the DVD!	5.0	2nd favorite Xmas Movie	2012-12-26	1	0	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A22S91YEO8DJBF	David R. Lorenz	Watching this film, myself, as an adult, I was just hysterical with laughter; I loved it!!But, watching it, as a father, well, I'll just say...it's not a family film. I felt on a whole, it's no worse than the &quot;Home Alone&quot; films, with the laugh-out-loud physical humor; on the other hand, there was brief nudity, and strong language (they say the 'F' word once, but still...), I can't comfortably allow my children to enjoy this film, and share the humorous moments (and there were many) with me.In short, I loved it. I appreciate good comedy. But, if you are searching for a wholesome, family Holiday film the whole entire family can enjoy together...well, um keep searching. As an adult, I enjoyed it; as a dad, I have to say it's not entirely approriate for younger viewers.	4.0	(Not A) Family Film	2002-01-13	2	1	1

From the 25,000 lights on the house, an embarrassing cousin, a Christmas tree going up in flames, a squirrel getting lose in the house, plus many more mishaps, it's not that simple.It's been somewhat of a tradition in my entire family to watch this movie every year at Christmas and we've been doing so for as long as I can remember.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1W3DWRDBIGUGD	Deanne Kelley	I first saw this movie in the theatre with my Dad when it was released.  He laughed so hard, I thought he was going to have an asthma attack.  I bought the movie and we watch it every year as a tradition.  I have family members who act like Clark Griswald's relatives, so I can actually relate to the characters in this movie (Scary eh?).There are so many great moments of comedy in this movie, the huge Christmas tree, overcooking the turkey until it explodes, and the Yuppie neighbors that despise Clark with a passion.  Chevy Chase is great as the Dad with the high expectations for a great Christmas and of course, the actual event never quite measures up to his hopes.  And that is what makes it funny. I give this one 5 stars.	5.0	You'll laugh until you cry, best &quot;vacation&quot; movie.	2002-10-30	3	3	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AGKJU4CBYSY1Y	Dennis Laycock	How this DVD qualifies as a &quot;special edition,&quot; I have no idea.  The &quot;special features&quot; include one audio commentary, the theatrical trailer and a non-interactive list of the cast and crew.  That's it.Sure, it's the first widescreen edition of this movie on DVD, but it's matted widescreen, which means that although we are seeing what the director intended us to see, it's also less picture than the fullscreen version.  It was shot in 1:85-1 ratio anyway, so it's not a big deal.The audio commentary is absolutely awful - the worst one I've ever heard.  For one, it's got way too many people on it... six, to be exact.  None of whom are Chevy Chase.  Watching the commentary is like watching the movie with a bunch of old ladies, as the actors constantly interrupt each other, repeat each other, try to remember the names of bit-part actors, start thoughts and don't complete them, and obsess about how they look onscreen.  I truly felt sorry for Johnny Galecki (Rusty Griswold), who's mostly silent except when the women prod him with stupid questions, like did he get to kiss Juliette Lewis (the answer is no).Even the DVD case is generic - the old-style paper case with the black plastic tab to close it.  Everything about this DVD screams &quot;ripoff.&quot;Still, I suppose I'm glad to have it, since it replaces a fuzzy VHS tape that I found in the hallway of the apartment I stayed in during college.  I still laughed out loud at the movie about a dozen times, even though I've seen it at least 50 times.	1.0	Five stars for the movie, -4 for this DVD	2003-12-17	27	13	14

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1U2IMZ2HM6ABF	De witte leeuw.	This is exactly why I do not like Jerry Lewis movies, because he was silly rather than funny.  Most of this particular film was predictable.  The scene where Chevy Chase is frustratingly attempting to get the lights he set up all over the exterior of his house and the wife turning on one light-switch inside, is belabored.  In other words it was repeated far too much.  Rendering his immediate neighbors in total darkness/lightness was again, just plain silly, for that scene's plot was inane and the actors were forced to play the part of stupid people.  No one could possibly be that clueless when it all began.  About two thirds of the way through this movie I turned it off from shear boredom.  I found &#34;Home Alone&#34; (original) far more hilarious.  I suppose this type of movie is why Amazon Prime can offer its viewing for free, i.e. because its just plain stupid, plot-less, and pointless to watch.	2.0	Silly is Not Funny.	2014-01-09	0	0	0

A little concerned, based on some of the reviews, that the video and/or sound quality of this DVD might be substandard, but overall, it's fine.  The video jittered a little on the intro., which is a cartoon, but that quickly resolved and from there on, the video quality is very good; maybe not the best HD Blu-ray, but obviously one.  The soundtrack isn't all that great; 2-channel and sound levels aren't totally consistent (might have to adjust the volume once in a while to hear the voice track), but it's okay overall.  Bottom line, great movie, really good video, acceptable audio.  We'll be watching this one every holiday season.	5.0	Hilarious movie; quality DVD	2013-02-16	1	1	0

While it seems a little tame and not quite as outrageous by today's standards, it has lost nothing in the way of hilarity over the years since it was first released.  There are scenes that will stick with you for years, and bring some good chuckles long after you've seen it.  For me the best example of this is the squirrel in the tree fiasco, with the ensuing freakouts among the family, and Chevy Chase waging war on the little thing.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and watch it again at every opportunity I get.  Many of my friends who don't like slapstick so much also did not like this movie...so be warned, if you don't see the humor in stuff like the 3 Stooges, you may not enjoy this as much as I did.	5.0	a slapstick holiday classic	2005-12-21	5	5	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2ZQD77EEXEPM6	dylan	This is a perfect entry in the vacation series.  It is packed with howls of laughter.  This movie will have you rolling on your floor laughing like you've never laughed before.  But.....just because it's a christmas movie doesn't really mean it's a kids holiday movie.  I don't really know if it's ok for your kids to watch, I mean, i let my kdis watch it and they laughed really hard, but it did have crude humor and some pretty fowl language.  You better watch it first and make a choise.  Anyway, this special edition is quite nice.  With a very entertaining commentary with the griswalds and alot of other special features, it's well worth the price.  Go ahead and get it.  You won't be dissapointed	5.0	HIALRIOUS	2004-02-29	0	0	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1UADLP7K5CFUJ	"e6bwhiz ""e6bwhiz"""	I love this movie and was excited to buy the new Special Edition DVD.  I have been watching it on an original VHS release until then.  It seems to me that to create the widescreen they may have cut some of the movie off the top and bottom.  If you have both, compare for yourself.  One of the scenes that clued me in on it was when they were eating the overcooked turkey.  In the original you can see Clark poring a large amount of gravy on his plate.  In the DVD you can't see it.Another thing I noticed is that during on part of Clark's speedy sled scene in the original, you could clearly see the rope pulling him.  In this DVD it may have been digitally erased, since I couldn't find it.I'm sure there are other things different.  I love the movie, but almost just want to stick with my original VHS release.	3.0	Different From Original?	2005-03-29	4	3	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1H5TB6Z687PZP	ebinrock	Like others here, I really enjoyed Christmas Vacation, and I thought it was very funny.  My favorite scene was when Clark calls his boss every name he can think of when he doesn't get his bonus.  (Who wrote that?)  I agree that this is a pretty basic DVD with hardly any extras.  Instead of production notes, I would like to see deleted scenes and especially bloopers!  However, I do not believe this movie needs to be widescreen, and I am a big fan of widescreen formatted movies.  The fact is, there are two kinds of widescreen: anamorphic, which has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and Academy Flat, which is 1.85:1.  Christmas Vacation is of the latter type.  Academy Flat movies are actually filmed in an aspect ratio very close to television anyway, 1.33:1, and later cropped in the theater during projection.  So a full screen version of an Academy Flat movie is actually showing you more than what was in the theater.  Academy Flat is really not that wide, so you're not adding a lot to the experience when you get a widescreen version.  That's why many Academy Flat DVD's are released full screen.	4.0	Very funny, needs more extras, but widescreen not necessary	2002-10-22	19	13	6

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A29D3LXDSX7AR9	Edward Balen	I own this movie on DVD as part of the Vacation 4-disc set.  I think it's awesome.  It's a roller coaster ride from beginning to end.I love the antics that Chevy Chase pulls off in this film.  Particularly the scene where he's hanging from the gutter, and the block of ice comes flying out the end, which crashes through his neighbor's window.As far as Randy Quaid and his faction of the family is concerned, again awesome antics.  The scene where Snots chases the squirrel around the dining room is pure hilarity.  I laugh just by thinking about it.One of my all time holiday songs appears on the soundtrack of this film.  I'm referring to Mele Kalikimaka, which was recorded by Bing Crosby.If you love holiday classics, love the Griswolds, or are a serious collector like myself, I recommend getting your hands on this movie.

The Christmas Vacation presents all of the kind of things we deal with during the holidays and a bunch we never thought of.  The cast does a great job lead by Chevy Chase.  I look forward to seeing this movie each year, just as I do for Miracle on 34th Street.

So go get that, and spare us your tired diatribes.Now, onto the movie. To me and my family, nothing says &quot;christmas&quot; like Christmas Vacation. In my house, it is NOT the holiday season until we've watched it a couple of times. It's a holiday classic, not to mention a comedy classic. It reminds me a lot of christmas at my house. It's the best christmas movie ever made. Period. END OF SENTENCE!!We all remember the Griswolds, don't we? Well, it's christmastime, and Clark (Chevy Chase) wants nothing more for his family than the best christmas ever. Of course, if your IQ is higher than your shoe size, then you should know it's not exactly smooth sailing. Burnt-out bulbs, oversized trees, and Ellen's wacky Cousin Eddie are just a few of the many mishaps along the way to the 25th. So many memorable scenes, so many memorable lines. (Check out the scene where Clark encounters a VERY attractive saleslady in a department store while shopping for lingerie. Priceless.)All in all, this movie IS christmas in my household, and it should be in yours. Definitely buy this on DVD.

The great thing about DVD's is you can skip those unwanted scenes.  For the most part, though, we really enjoy the movie because it shows the joy in family Christmases together.  It also reminds us that we all have our own *challenges* with family.	4.0	A Modern Christmas Classic	2005-10-13	0	0	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation . . . what can I say? It's a comedy classic! It's yet another film that you can enjoy during the holiday season. It's also the best National Lampoon motion picture that features the Griswolds. It has a cleverly written script, interesting characters, and the true definition of family gatherings (well, maybe not ENTIRELY true, but true nonetheless). But I think the best part of this film is the humor. There are so many sight gags and witty dialogue that anyone can remember off the top of their heads. The most memorable scenes include bringing the humongous Christmas tree into the house, the dry turkey, the squirrel, the awkward talk with a female salesperson, and of course, ""s****er was full!"". While it may not be one of my all-time favorite films, it's still one of the greatest Christmas films of all time. You can watch it along with It's A Wonderful Life, A Christmas Story, Miracle on 34th Street, Elf, Home Alone, A Charlie Brown Christmas, Scrooge, Scrooged, A Garfield Christmas, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, etc etc etc etc etc etc etc.Grade: A"	5.0	Christmas couldn't get any funnier than this!	2009-12-22	0	0	0

Although I don't regret the purchase, I don't notice much of a difference from the upscaled DVD through the Blue Ray Player.  Great movie, but the 3 stars vs higher reflects the fact I was not impressed with the upgrade.  To be fair, it could be the age of the movie and my expectations could have been too high.  Picture is decent...  If you are purchasing for the first time, the blu ray makes sense.

Behn	I'm an infrequent movie watcher, but we decided to watch a movie in the evening on Christmas Day while our granddaughter was over.  It had some funny parts, but there was a little too much Chevy Chase slapstick for my tastes.  As it went along, I did forget at times how dated it was.  I suppose that qualifies it as a timeless classic.  While it's not a &#34;drop everything to see it&#34; movie, I'd recommend it if you're just sitting around looking for some light background entertainment with a nice ending.  I suppose sometime I should watch &#34;It's a Wonderful LIfe&#34; from beginning to end.

Chevy Chase, the consummate family man, tries his darnedest to pull off a good old fashioned family Christmas.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AYWAY5MKLAITN	Film Noir Fedora	Clark W. Griswald finally has all his chips in order. He's got a christmas vacation all planned out and a nice juicy chirstmas bonus coming to him. But things go awry when his cousin comes down to visit, when their tree keeps on having to be replaced, and when the relatives start coming over. It's a classic holdiay bumble comedy that doesn't stop with the slapstick or the unforgetable screwy scenerio's. This is one comedy that's good for the whole family to enjoy. Rnady quiad plays the excelent free-loader who just can't get enough of taking advantage of Clark's hospitality.Deck the halls with laughter with this one as you watch this simple holiday rest spin into an uncontrolabe christmas that no one is going to forget.Enjoy!	5.0	"""Tis the season to be merry."""	2006-04-03	3	2	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1RBHMMBLODH9R	Fogcatcher	"The third and best of the Chevy Chase-National Lampoon series kicks off with Clark Griswold hosting this year's Christmas celebration.  Of course, that means lots of family, welcome or otherwise, showing up at his door.  Randy Quaid, playing cousin Eddie, shows up at Clark's home with his R.V., a total heap.  Clark does his best to have a good time, but nothing goes right.  He's brought to the breaking point with annoying relatives, Chistmas lights that refuse to work, and a bonus that causes him to flip out.Christmas Vacation is a laugh a minute.  You know people liked the movie when they keep repeating some of the one-liners.  Here's some of my favorites:""You couldn't hear a dump truck driving through a nitro-glycerin plant.""""We're going to have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny F-n Kay.""""That there's a quality item.""I watch this movie every year, usually right after Planes, Trains and Automobiles.

The funniest person is the old lady that is very disoriented. I love this movie and the DVD is great too! I love the really long trailors for each &quot;Vacation&quot; movie. You can relate to this movie, with the snotty neighbors, and the forgotten, dusty gift in the attic. And I'm sure some of you out there can relate to the unexpected guest arriving, much to your displeasure. Chevy Chase's car scene in the beginning reminded me so much of my Dad's driving.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1I8F97AHES8YD	George Graham	Perhaps one of the greatest comebacks in comedy history, this third Vacation is just as funny as the first, almost (ALMOST) erasing memory of Vacation 2, European. Anyway, the Griswolds are staying home for the holidays. Clark (Chevy Chase) has cut down a tree too big for the living room; the in-laws are all invited, except Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid)and his clan, but they show up anyway; and John Hughes has delivered another comic delight.As I said earlier, the Vacation series has an odd history. The first was great, an adult family comedy (yep, it's possible). Then the sequel, European Vacation, was released, with a bad joke for every good joke the first one had. Also, Audrey and Rusty were now played by different actors, neither very good (admittedly, the Rusty and Audrey are different in this, too, but they're effective), and poor Eric Idle (and other British actors) who make appearances.Oh yeah, this is a review of Christmas Vacation. Yeah, this movie is equally funny as the first, a bit less adult, but still throwing in plenty of bad taste, all of it side-splitting. There's a electrocuted kitty, a very special Christmas dinner, a flaming tree, and a sled ride with a trash can lid. There's kidnapping and a squirrel attack for good effect, as well. So if you didn't think it was possible to redeem the Vacation movies, here's proof. Merry Christmas, fans... and burn all copies of European Vacation.	4.0	Kids, look, a deer!	2006-01-14	1	1	0

I purchased it based on the numerous positive reviews... what a let down. Even the cable guy is funny next to this. Badly acted, clumsy, badly aged, miserable movie, that's what this is. I smiled once at the end of the movie, but even then, it was just a smile. You see everything coming 10mn before it happens, there is no wit. You are supposed to watch the main character make a stupid face during a minute and find it funny. Pepople here talk about sarcasm... sarcasm? What's sarcastic is that anyone would find this funny. You could show this movie to the public in ""idiocracy"", and yes, they would have a good laugh... Plus it is not something you would want to show young kids in my opinion. My 12 year old daugther said at the end that she hated that movie, it was too negative, boring, and had nothing to do with Christmas.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3S738GO35SH0W	Greg Hughes	Plenty of films have been made about that magical season of miracles - a time when people are pressured into being happy and jolly, the suicide rate goes up, and relatives are forced to pretend they like each other. In a word: Christmas. &quot;National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation&quot; could well be the best (and funniest) film about Christmas ever made.For Clark Griswold, Christmas turns out to be anything but a happy, harmonious affair. Everything goes wrong. The Christmas that Clark envisions becomes a holiday fraught with hilarious mishaps, setbacks and disappointments. Nevertheless, Clark is determined to make this Christmas work.Things don't get any better with the unexpected arrival of cousin Eddie.&quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; is a film packed with moments of sheer laughter at Clark's expense. One scene I always think of is Clark getting ready to carve the turkey, with the relatives sitting around the table looking on. It sounds like a common enough picture. But this film takes it to a whole new dimension.If your Christmas is going badly, this film will certainly put things into perspective. This is as close to reality as a Christmas story can get.	5.0	All is Glum, All is Blight	2001-06-23	2	2	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3LU79BYMWZEW9	Gregor von Kallahann	"Chevy Chase is always, at the very least, interesting to watch.  Since his one-year stint on SNL (and one tends to forget that it was that brief a stay), he seems to pretty much have had a corner on the snarky, self-referential humor market.  Bill Murray and Steve Martin, you could say, were kind of operating in the same universe for a long time, but they've actually been able to move on beyond that, at least a good deal of the time.  Chevy--as good as he can be at what he does--does not seem a likely candidate for an Oscar or for recognition for his efforts at serious literature or drama.And I'm fine with that, but his movies have been so spotty really that I find myself wishing that he had indeed stuck it out a few seasons more at 30 Rockefeller Plaza after all.  He was a solid skit comedian, after all, and a few more seasons of him in that capacity (preserved on DVD for generations yet to come) might have solidified his rep, more so than most of his movies could ever do And let's not even bring up the talk show debacle, except to offer it as proof that a brilliant skit comedian really can't be assumed to be able to do it all.  If anything, we might assert that Chase was a performer whose best work was ""in character,"" but whose characterizations might not be able to sustain a two hour movie.The LAMPOON VACATION series merged at least two of the personae that Chase cultivated on SNL, the bumbling klutz he used in his Jerry Ford take-offs and the sardonic wisea$$ he used on WEEKEND UPDATE.  For good measure, he threw in a riff on your standard sit-com dad, who was not only a bit of a bumbler, but one with a real serious DARK SIDE.  Imagine, Ward Cleaver possessed by Satan.  Or if not quite that, one with very serious ANGER issues.  It's not all that pretty.  And come to think of it, not everyone will find it (him) all that amusing.Behind all the slapstick and broad humor, there's a real bitter streak in this film.  It seems reflective of a real ambivalence towards, if not a downright cynicism about, how Christmas is celebrated in this county--a sentiment that Chase surely shared with writher/producer John Hughes.  Sure there's a (tongue in cheek) taste of CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS optimism here: you know what I mean, the sense that the holidays are worth celebrating despite the commercialism, the family dramas, the overwhelming stress, and all the things that lead to holiday depression.  But there's no ""sincere"" Christmas tree: just ridiculously grandiose ones or makeshift substitutes after the first one is destroyed. And there's no Linus figure gently pointing out the ""true meaning of Christmas.""  There's some lip service to such sentiments at the movie's end, but it's really not to be believed.  Everything suggests that Chevy Chase's Clark Griswold character has only succeeded in fooling himself, perhaps only very briefly, that his disastrous holiday was in fact a successful celebration of the season after all.The movie left me drained.  I was up for a bit of absurdity, a bit of high jinks and, yes, a dollop or two of what might be loosely termed ""social criticism.""  I didn't expect--nor do I ever expect of a post-modern comedy--a somewhat tricked out re-make of A WONDERFUL LIFE.  On the other hand, this one just left me with a bad taste in my mouth."	3.0	Dark Holiday	2010-05-30	11	4	7

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3B08DCVOC1BDI	"""halo1000"""	With the Christmas season approaching, I thought I'd give my review of Christmas Vacation. While some people are watching It's a Wonderful Life, I'm watching the hilarious antics of Clark W. Griswold.If you've seen the other Vacation movies, you know that poor old Clark W. Griswold brings disaster with him wherever he goes. Although, with this go-round, he stays home this time, trying to throw a &quot;Good-old-fashioned-family Christmas&quot;. But, of course, there's disaster at every corner. Clark staples himself to a storm gutter putting up Christmas lights, which cause brownouts. A squirrel lives in his Christmas tree. His cousin's doberman brings down the house. Literally. His snooty neighbors won't cut him any slack. He puts an experimental kitchen lubricant on his pan sled.  And, on top of that, his hilariously goofy cousin (Randy Quaid) shows up without warning.The cast is great. Chevy Chase is, as always, histerical, as is Beverly D'Angelo as his smart-aleck wife. Julia-Louis Dreyfus is great as one of Clark's stuck-up neighbors, but the funniest role has to be Randy Quaid as Clark's redneck cousin, Eddie. Quaid was perfect for that role, as well as the rest of Clark's and Ellen's families. I also like the animated Santa intro to the movie, where Santa visits the Griswold residence. If you think you're having a bad holiday, one viewing of this film will quickly change your mind. If you don't laugh at this movie, I will come over to your house and force you to watch this movie several times over. You have to see Christmas Vacation at least once. How could you not laugh at Clark's antics?	5.0	Impossible not to laugh	2000-12-19	28	23	5
079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3P9D22KDEXVMN	"Happy Chappy ""An Avid Reader."""	Here it is, Christmas time again.  In addition to the egg nog and rest of the season, it is time to watch Christmas Vacation for the umpteenth time.  I actually struggled over how many stars to give this film.  Let's face it, the movie is not Casablanca; however, it is just so hilarious in parts, that I can't help but be entertained.  There are some hilarious moments in this film.  These go hand in hand with some of the more inappropriate and gross jokes and sight gags.  There are also a couple of downright poignant moments like when Clark AKA Sparky is up in the attic watching old home movies.  There have been many pretenders; such as the recently awful Deck the Halls, but for the true Holiday comedy classic, you can't go wrong with Christmas Vacation.	4.0	It's That Time of Year	2007-12-25	0	0	0

It's just not officially Christmas unless I've watched this film.  I'm NOT a big Chevy Chase fan, but he's perfect in this film.  It's impossible to select my favorite scene - the Squirrel?  The unfortunate cat?  The sled?  The turkey?  The pool fantasy?  &quot;Bit of a nip in the air?&quot;  I can't decide.But for me, anyway, my favorite line is easy to pick. Beverly DeAngelo:  &quot;I don't know what to say, dear, except that it's Christmas -- and we're ALL miserable!&quot;  (You have to be there, to understand.)Oh! And be sure to take a close look at what Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid are drinking out of when they drink the eggnog -- a little reward for fans of National Lampoon's Family Vacation.Get this movie, and enjoy!	5.0	A Christmas Comedy Classic!	2002-01-01	1	1	0

This one is full of laughs and VERY funny moments.Instead of traveling(like in every other &quot;Vacation&quot; movie)The Griswalds are going to invite the whole family over and have a &quot;Fun-filled old fashioned family Christmas&quot;.. NOT!! Every thing goes wrong... They get tailed by two thugs while driving out of town to get their christmas tree which is taller than their living room ceiling, Clarke puts in money ahead of time for a swimming pool, Clarke(Chevy Chase) puts 2,500 lights on his roof, and so on.Then the realitives arrive, bearing arguments and family fights. And then Cousin Eddy(Randy Quaid)comes and surprises every one and &quot;shacks up with them.&quot; I don't want to give the whole movie away(especially the GREAT ending..)so I'll stop there.I own this movie and have watched it over 50 times, and I laugh EVERY time! I highly reccommend buying this movie, it's worth the $....(This is definently better than Chase's Fletch or Funny Farm.)	5.0	National Lampoon Makes a  FUNNY &quot;Vacation&quot; movie again!!!!	2001-02-18	0	0	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A319SKSB556033	"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews"""	I'm so glad Warner wised up and re-released this in OAR. It truly is the best Vacation movie and this DVD is miles better than my crappy old pan and scan VHS copy.With a strong John Hughes script, an ace comic performance from Chase and onslaught of jokes and quotable dialogue this is not only best of the &quot;Vacation&quot; series but one of THE Xmas movies. There certain movies that Xmas cannot be without (Scrooged, Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Gremlins are the others) and this is one of them. Xmas Vacaction is definitely the new 'It's A Wonderful Life'.This time the Griswolds are staying at home in the snowy suburbs of Chicago and are preparing for the 'best Xmas ever' as Clark has been dreaming of a 'good ol' fashioned family Xmas all his life'. But it's not that simple. The in-laws hate each other, brother and sister are forced to sleep together, there's no Xmas bonus (not a good one anyway) and Hillbilly cousin Eddie (a classic performance from Randy Quaid) imposes in an impromptu 'surprise' visit. It seems like a disaster waiting to happen but there is no waiting; Just disaster, as everything that can go wrong...does. And them some. But the ever-delusional Chase will not let any little mishaps sway his optimism.The suburban-American Xmas atmosphere is captured perfectly and snow covered scenery gives the impression of a very cosy Xmas. Watch this film during advent, I guarantee it will be to your festive benefit.The new DVD has an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 and has a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack. It's definitely one to get for this time of year.	5.0	Widescreen at last!!!	2003-11-08	6	5	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1D600X7EDGIVD	"Jack Cox ""Reviewer Extraordinare"""	Let me just say, that I like this movie for one reason, because it actually tells the truth, Not all of us are happy on the holidays, and we may not be getting a big bonus, or we could be having a very sick cousin, or everyone really does not want to see each other. This is why this film is funny, it doesn't put itself behind a charade and make itself something it's not it shows people what a terrible christmas would be like, and I think people laugh at this because they know that they could never be in these situations, plus most of the situations Chevy Chase and Company get in simply are a hoot. If you want the &quot;other&quot; true meaning of christmas get this movie.	5.0	A True Definition of Christmas	2002-12-16	0	0	0
079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1UPK9GG149W82	Jack Garvey	I have watched it every Xmas season to lower my false expectations that this season has in our country. This is the Xmas from Hell and yet with Chevy stumbling along in Blind Faith in the Universe, it actually turns out.  When he puts on his hockey mask half way thru the movie and takes out his chain saw to get ..... another tree . . . his interaction with his Yuppie neighbor is priceless ( you will recongnize Elaine from Seinfield).  Great cast and comic timing from the opening scene with the kids to the Buster Keaton ending.  At the conclusion, you can only say: Yeah, my Christmas was pretty smooth last year . . . not matter what drama you had felt had ruined your holidays.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2X3025TZFOQ1O	"Jacob A. ""braintoad"""	Since about 1995, christmas at our house jsut wouldnt be the same if we didn't watch &quot;christmas vacation&quot; and &quot;christmas story&quot; about 80 times between the dvd and when its on tv.  This movie is perfect.  I can't think of a single instance in the film where something could be changed.  Teh best of the vacation movies and one of my all time favorite films, Christmas Vacation shows every family that no matter how bad christmas is at your house it could always be worse. If you like Chevy Chase, in his good days, or any of the other vacation movies then buy this now, don't rent, don't think jsut buy.  Even if its jsut for the sleddign scene this movie is worth 14 bux.  Video quality o nthe dsic is clear and clean, but not mindblowing, it doesn't need to be.  the sound is good, voices are clear, music doesn't drown anyone out. ONce again nothing spectacular but it doesnt need to be.  Extras are slim pickings, but there wouldnt be much to put on here anyways.  Even tho thsi movie will be on tv 3468 times between November 1st and December 25th. It is still worth owning as it can be watched year round.  You won't fee lstoopid watching it at other times in the year.  Christmas in July, anyone?	5.0	A Christmas Tradition	2001-12-10	4	2	2

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A35NBGDTL6F2XJ	James Choma	Man, is this a funny movie.  It has taken the place in our DVD collection along side &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; &quot;A Christmas Story,&quot; and &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas.&quot;  It has all the right elements for the season: humor, a good storyline, and a lot of holiday spirt.  And while I'm not a very big fan of Chevy Chase, he's perfect reprising his role as the befuddled Clark Griswold, trying to keep the relative happy during the holidays.I'm not going to be saying anything new that the 200+ people have already said regarding the storyline of this movie, but I will pull out a few favorite scenes:* Randy Quaid as Eddie emptying out his RV's toilet in the street.  Eddie steals every scene he's in.* Clark meeting Eddie's dog Snots for the first time.* The squirrel attack.* Uncle Louis catching on fireThe list can go on and one, but so do the laughs with this movie.  This is simply just a great holiday film that you can watch anytime the mood strikes.  It touches on all that can (and often does) go wrong during the holidays, but it all comes together with a happy ending.  Highly recommended!	5.0	SQUIRREL!!!	2004-03-01	6	6	0
079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3N17TV4XU3HYJ	James Douglass	Just like every National Lampoon movie, this one does not dissapoint. As a matter of fact, I consider this movie to be a classic no doubt about this. this is something that you can enjoy with your family and your loved ones. Chevey Chase was hilarious. Most of the old people there seem to annoy me. Like the guy that burnt down the tree. And that crazy guy from Independence Day that flew the plane into the alien thing was on it too. I forget his name on the movie but he was funny too. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The best part was when Chevey was going crazy because he didnt get his bonus and he started to flip out on everybody. Then the guy kidnapped the boss and brought him to the house. It was pretty funny. The old lady saying the national anthem during grace was also funny. The ending was straight up hilarious. I can't tell you what happened because you need to get it for yourself to see. This is one of those movies that you must add to your collection.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3MQ8QTNM6SZT7	James E. Robinson	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has become a perennial Christmas classic for its timeless portrayal of a family, brought together to fulfill the oft stated holiday ideal of spending time with family, The movie gains its appeal by so accurately exaggerating (ever so slightly) the dysfunction that comes in assembling so many diverse or even eccentric personalities together over the holiday backdrop in a way that every family can relate to.  Truly, every family has a Cousin Eddie, in-laws who are always critical, parents or grandparents who are supportive yet always did something more or better when they were young.  In essence, the appeal of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is less as a holiday film than it is a comedically brilliant, albeit an accurate portrayal of how families coexist with one another, all in the name of the &#34;family&#34; bond.	5.0	A Christmas Classic	2013-07-19	0	0	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1HJLULWTVRWIE	Jason	Many thoughts come to mind when I think of Christmas... Family, Friends, Presents and so on. The first thing I usually think about when I hear Christmas? National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Some may think A Christmas story, Elf, Miracle on 34th Street among others. None of those touch Christmas Vacation. This movie screams Christmas to me! I absolutely love this movie. There have been years where I have lived this movie. This gift set is the ultimate gift for that person who loves this movie. It comes with a blu-ray edition of the movie. Much better picture but the same features as the DVD.It comes with a packet of instant snow which I am sureI will never open or use. Next is the coasters. Various character coasters that have quotes from the movie are nice and good quality. You have a santa hat with a marty moose emblem on it which is nice quality. You have a I survived a Griswold family christmas which is great I wore it this year with pride haha. You also get a marty moose mug but its a mini replica and can't be used. My only gripe about the whole set I wish it was full size and useable. All in all its a great Christmas movie that you can watch over and over and the gifts you get with this collectors edition is well worth the extra money. Definately buy this and enjoy every Christmas!!	5.0	This is Christmas!	2012-01-03	1	1	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2236W0X2LTB7J	Jayebee	There are a few classic Christmas movies that we must include in our holiday itinerary and this is one of them.  Chevy Chase was in is heyday and his unique humor is contagious and non-stop.  The cast of characters supports the wacky theme and guarantees great belly laughs from the whole family.  I have viewed it, many times and look forward to next year.  If you haven't seen it you must give it a try.	5.0	Classical Classic	2013-12-18	0	0	0

It is one of those films that will never get old no matter how many times you've seen it. I mean how could the sight of cousin Eddie in his bathrobe emptying sewage from his mobile home on a nice winters morning get old? If you haven't seen this one yet I would strongly recommend picking it up. The whole family will love it.	5.0	One of my All-time Favorite Christmas Movies	2007-11-23	1	1	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3SJMW269N75IL	Jaylyn	The last true family man. That is how Clark Griswald is described by his fellow co-worker reguarding using his Christmas bonus to put in an in-ground pool for his family. Needing to place a $7500 deposit to ensure the pool gets put in at the right time the ground is thawing, Clark overextends himself, not having the money in his bank accout to cover the check he wrote, he needs this bonus more than ever. each day the bonus doesn't show up in the mail, Clark's good ol' family fun filled Christmas cheer is being drained.. quickly.. with the help of his family. As having your own parents stay with you during the holidays isn't hard enough, he's forced to share his holiday with his wine guzzling, chain smoking mother in law, uptight father in law, Aunt Bethany who wraps things from around her house to give as presents, not excluding living things, Uncle Lewis whom I thought for the longest time was Maury Povitch. But nothing compares to what rolls in, complete with home to invade and shamelessly impose on this Christmas, Cousin Eddie (played by the hilarious Randy Quaid) and his family. Between squirrels stowing away in the Christmas tree, Juliette Lewis' (Audrey) eye balls being frozen, and Chevy Chase punching a plastic Santa in it's face, it's the little things in this movie that make it an all time classic. I would even watch this if it weren't Christmas time. This is the last of the great 80's comedies.	5.0	Don't Throw Me Down, Clark....	2004-11-28	3	3	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2C5LA07JCDWTN	"J. Brittman ""The Bottom Line"""	Christmas Vacation is the funniest of all three of the Vacation films. The reason is simple: lots of Clark and tons of Cousin Eddie. These two together are the funniest thing going. The dialogue is hilarious:Clark: Can I get you somemore eggnog? Drive you out to the middle of nowhere, leave you for dead?Eddie: No, I'm just fine Clark.OREddie: You surprised Clark?Clark: Surprised, if I woke up tomorrow with my head sewn to the carpet I wouldn't be as surprised as I am now.OREddie: I can't swim, Clark.Clark: I know that Eddie.ORClark: Where's Eddie? He usually eats these G-d damn things?Catherine: Oh not anymore, he found out that squirrel is high in cholesterol.Randy Quaid will never play a better character and aside from Fletch, this is what Chevy Chase's legacy will be. Also the periphery characters are hilarious. Aunt Bethany (Is Rusty Still in the Navy? or Don't throw me down Clark or Is your house on fire, Clark?), Uncle Louis (So what's the matter with you?), Clark's parents (SQUIRREL!!!!!!!!), Ellen's Parents (The little lights aren't twinkling...), and Clark's kids (who are different ages in every film).Christmas Vacation is a true holiday classic for the rest of us who don't lead picture perfect lives and don't pull off every holiday without a glitch.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2WJSVSBXEYEF	Jefferson T. Packer	"For children, the approach of Christmas is a time of breathless anticipation.  For many adults, it is a feeling of slow strangulation.  There is no question that this is an adult Christmas film, best watched after everyone under about age 14 is tucked safely into bed for their long winter's nap.Don't fill your eggnog glasses too full, however; because fifteen minutes into ""Christmas Vacation"" you'll be laughing so hard that you'll be wearing your Old English and J&B; on your reindeer sweater.  Quite simply, this movie is the most side-splittingly funny film ever made about the American tradition of all getting together in one house for Christmas and driving each other nuts.Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) is the focal point of the hilarity, caught as he is in a futile struggle to live up to his own impossible expectations about himself and his role as his extended family's new patriarch and benevolent provider.  The three sets of elderly grandparents who detest each other all add to his feeling of tension and pressure; and the uninvited appearance of cousin Eddy, his family and his snot-soaked dog in a moldering, ancient RV is the final jewel in this crown of comedic genius.Add to this equation the whining teenage daughter, the ever-patient and eternally suffering son, the boss who doesn't even know his name, the Christmas bonus check that still hasn't arrived, and the 25,000 ""Imported Italian Twinkle Lights"" that simply refuse to light, (or twinkle,) and you have in Clark a man who is standing, as he howls at one point, ""on the brink of Hell.""Throughout it all, the exquisite and irreplaceable Beverly D'Angelo breezes around as Clark's beautiful and inhumanly loving and patient wife; proving conclusively that even being married to the perfect woman isn't enough to make a man happy when he expects the superhuman from himself.With these ingredients and these actors alone, we have a potentially good, funny, interesting film.  There is, however, a third element that pushes this movie over the top and into the realm of true, timeless greatness; and that is the sheer love it has for the often burdensome cross of family.I challenge you to watch this and not tear up at some point.  When Clark finds old 8mm film of his childhood Christmases in the '50's; when his father comes out to the laundry room to give him a loving word of advice; when the godd**n lights FINALLY come on.  These are just a few of the moments where I pretend my nose is stuffed up, and keep my face turned so that my tears are invisible.  This film genuinely loves Clark and his all-too-familiar family; and even though each heartwrenching moment is likely to be followed by an exquisite gag that will have you crying and choking at the same time, I challenge you not to love yourself and everyone around you (even your relatives) just a little bit more after watching this classic.Merry Christmas."	5.0	A loving roast of an American tradition	2005-12-19	7	7	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2V3P1XE33NYC3	Jeffrey Leach	"You really take your life in your hands every time you sit down with a Chevy Chase film. Let's face reality here: Chevy Chase is responsible for several of the worst movies ever made. Does it take more than a few minutes of viewing to see the mind numbing folly of ""Nothing But Trouble,"" ""The Three Amigos,"" and ""Spies Like Us""? Chase has sure had his truly embarrassing moments on the big screen. What redeems the guy, at least in my eyes, are several films that play up to the comedian's smart alecky, deadpan delivery. ""Fletch,"" of course, is the gold standard of Chevy Chase films, but other movies showcase his talents just as well. I always thought ""Deal of the Century"" a classic Chase film, as well as ""Foul Play"" (although the latter was more of an ensemble picture). But we need look no further than the four National Lampoon Vacation films to truly judge the merits of this comedian turned actor. Actually, I should say three Vacation films since the second installment, where the Griswold family went on a tour of Europe, ranks as one of the most dreadful stories ever put on film. Of the three successful entries, ""Christmas Vacation"" is the best, perhaps even eclipsing the first movie that started it all.You won't hear the familiar strains of Lindsey Buckingham's ""Holiday Road"" in ""Christmas Vacation,"" and there are no corpses strapped to the top of a station wagon either. Instead, the film invites us into the Griswold home for an old fashioned Christmas celebration the likes of which soon reach catastrophic levels. Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) Griswold, along with their disinterested kids Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Russ (Johnny Galecki), invite the whole family over for a season filled with happiness. Clark's parents Clark Sr. (John Randolph) and Nora (Diane Ladd) show up, as does Ellen's folks Art (E.G. Marshall) and Frances (Doris Roberts). And yes, even Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) makes an appearance to save the day. Of course, along with the family comes the inevitable frustrations and stresses everyone who has ever dealt with a reunion dreads. Clark Griswold refuses, at least initially, to fall into a morass of cynicism and despair amidst the bickering and insults. His invention of a new milk preservative has our hero hoping his Christmas bonus will be extra big this year, big enough so he can install an in ground swimming pool in the backyard. Unfortunately, his boss Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray) is a scrooge with plans to make the company more fiscally conservative.While he waits for the check to arrive at the house, Clark embarks on several hilarious projects that haul in the belly laughs. His attempts to cover every square inch of his house with Christmas lights is a chore requiring several falls off a ladder, pointed verbal repartees with his snotty neighbors Margo and Todd Chester (Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest), and repeated failures to get the strands to light up. The acquisition and installment of the Griswold family Christmas tree is another chore handled in Clark's inimitable style. Imagine the pine they string up in Rockefeller Square every year, subtract roughly five feet from its height, and you have the tree Clark insists on setting up in the house. This thing is so huge that the branches knock out the windows when Griswold cuts the rope holding the branches together. No Yuletide season, however, would be complete without a trip to the slopes for a sledding excursion, an event filled with disastrous implications when Griswold comes up with the bright idea to cover the bottom of his sled with a Teflon based substance. My favorite scenario involves Clark trapped in his attic for a few hours. He spends his time dressed up in women's clothing (to stay warm) watching old home movies of his childhood. His abrupt fall through the trap door had me laughing for hours afterwards.The cast of ""Christmas Vacation"" gels fantastically, far better than any cast in the other three films. Kudos as always go to Randy Quaid as the squirrelly moocher Eddie; a film in this series just wouldn't be the same without this character driving Clark to fits of distraction. Beverly D'Angelo is one of those actresses who get hotter and hotter with age. The linchpin of the film is, as always, Chevy Chase as the disaster prone Clark Griswold. This is a role tailor made for his brand of clumsy, caustic humor. I don't know about you, but Chase's depiction reminds me in many ways of my own father--he won't listen to the advice of anyone else, his ideas are the best ideas, he tosses safety to the wind when working on dangerous projects, etc. But like my Dad--and probably countless other fathers--Clark is sincere and wants his loved ones to have wonderful family memories. The film works so well, I suspect, because most of us instantly recognize his character traits in our own beloved family patriarchs. Especially when Clark can't stand the pressure anymore and launches into one of his over the top tirades, again a trademark of our own fed up fathers.Although the DVD carries the ""Special Edition"" tag, the extras are surprisingly sparse. A trailer and a commentary constitute the sum total of goodies available on the disc. Moreover, the commentary doesn't include Chevy Chase. At least you hear Randy Quaid, Beverly D'Angelo, Johnny Galecki, Miriam Flynn (Eddie's wife Catherine), director Jeremiah Chechik, and producer Marty Simmons, but why no Clark W. Griswold? Perhaps he wanted too much money. His absence is unfortunate and mars what is otherwise a great commentary track. I don't even wait until Christmas to watch this movie; it's fun works year round. If you haven't seen it yet, you ought to immediately. You'll love it."	5.0	The best of the Vacation series	2004-09-07	122	96	26

I am not happy with amazon using USPS for almost 100% of the shipments to me (many purchases!) this holiday season, and it caused  numerous delays-- in receiving packages, in packages getting returned to seller by USPS without my authorization, lack of refunds for those items returned (and still no word on where the heck a number of those packages are, I may add!), and huge inconveniences for me to find the times to pick up all the packages at the post office.  This item should have come before Christmas, based on nearly every single interaction I've ever had with amazon, but it instead arrived nearly ONE WHOLE MONTH after I ordered it. That is NOT ACCEPTABLE.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2G1872LMRKVFK	Jennifer Thompson	"This film marks the return of the famous slap-stick comedy of the Griswold's.  The film takes place during the Christmas holiday season and revolves around the antics of Clark Griswold, played by Chevy Chase and his endeavor to provide his family the ""perfect"" Christmas.  Everyone can relate to the colorful array of characters and the experience of spending the holiday season with relatives.  Randy Quaid, brings to life the character of Eddie, who is Clark's unemployed, mooching cousin and will make anyone appreciate their own unique relative.  The script written by the ever popular, John Hughes, is priceless in its content of tasteless humor.This film deserves a four out of five stars rating.  If it isn't already a part of your family's holiday tradition it's worth considering adopting."	4.0	A Favorite Holiday Tradition	2003-07-31	0	0	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3KNGGHPT859N	"J. Gibson ""Movie Lover"""	There is a sappy irreverence about this Christmas movie.  Sometimes it goes as far to the edge of what will be accepted but at it's core it's about a family that tries real hard to do all the holiday traditions.  Chevy Chase is the hapless dad who would be a nightmare to live next door to at Christmas (probably at Halloween, too)!  The pathetic relatives who come to visit are caricatures to be sure but that's what one expects with a National Lampoon movie isn't it?  So, check your objectivity at the door and just enjoy it.

And I was dissapointed to see that the regular edition DVD didn't have any deleted scenes or anything. But when I discovered that this was releasing I thought it would have all of that plus more! MAN! was a fooled! Believe me! This new special edition DVD makes a deceptive use of the words ""Deluxe"" and ""Anniversary"". Take any other movie that uses thoses words and you usually have some new surprises like deleted scenes, bloopers, behind the scenes, and etc... But not this DVD!!!! They didn't even try! This DVD may look great but it's still the same as the original DVD. Only diiference is you get a big metal box with the DVD, an ornament, coasters, a little bag of fake snow, and a little hat with Marty Moose on it! Well! Woop De Do! I can go just fine with out that stuff any day! I want extra features that are actually part of the DVD!!! So, take my advise and don't by this new DVD! You're better off buying the original DVD!!!!!

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AOXFMZ6611588	JK	"It's not the slapstick pranks, like falling off of the roof while hanging Christmas lights that make this movie (although they're funny); it's the subtle jokes, like Cousin Eddie wearing a black dickey under a white V-neck sweater.  It's these jokes that make National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation not only a pleasure to watch once, but one to watch every Christmas season.  So, if you appreciate a good laugh with a smattering of good will, make Christmas Vacation part of your family tradition.The movie opens with a car-ride sing-a-long while heading into the backcountry to harvest the family Christmas tree.  Mom and Dad sing enthusiastically while the children roll their eyes.  It's the relatable experiences like this one paired with the far-fetched antics of the Griswold family that make this National Lampoon's installment a success.  After marching in waste-high snow for hours, Clark finds their glorious tree only to realize that he has forgotten a saw. Gaffes like this cause Clark's ideal holiday to fall apart.The progressively deeper dong of the family door bell announces the arrival of the extended family- Clark's parents and in-laws.  Their bickering is heard even before the door is opened and stories of bunions and boils spill over into the Griswold household.  Each of these characters adds a little more chaos and humor, but none as much as the surprise guest- Cousin Eddie.Eddie and his rag-tag family pull up in what Clark describes as a ""tenement of wheels.""  Eddie and his RV are a source of some of the best laughs in this film: whether it's Eddie's black dickie worn under a white v-neck sweater or his need to empty the RV's septic tank into the street sewer.  My favorite line from Eddie is when he informs Clark that he can't go sledding because the government had to change the metal plate in his head to a plastic one because every time his wife fired up the microwave, he'd `collapse, wet himself, and forget who he was.'After a visit to the local sledding hill, we follow the Clark as he does last minute Christmas shopping, finishes affixing 150,000 light bulbs to his roof, prepares Christmas dinner, and reads The Night Before Christmas.  All events most Christians can relate to.  Of course, none of these go quite as planned, but that's what creates the humor.Underlying all of the hilarity are some serious themes- Eddie is impoverished and can't buy his kids gifts, Clark has put a deposit down on a swimming pool banking on a Christmas bonus that never comes, and the family seems ready to fall apart.  Maybe the Griswolds aren't so fictitious after all.  These moments don't detract from the humor though.  They simply add that special Christmas spirit and good will we look for at this time of year.So, if you're looking for a movie the whole family can enjoy while running here and there during the hectic Christmas season, try National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  You won't be disappointed."	5.0	A Christmas Classic	2011-10-17	4	4	0

I guess I can't complain to much since I only spent 4 dollars on it but when your told it was in very good condition you would think it would at least play.

The hillbilly relatives, the snooty inlaws, the uninvited guest pets, and most of all, the bickering. This movie is a little to the extreme but not by much. This is what Christmas means to me.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3A48XEYWLWH7T	John IV	Lower key and perhaps more endearing than its predecessors, this third installment of the Vacation saga finds the Clark W. Griswolds hosting their family for some Christmas fun.  Chevy returns as usual as the hapless every-dad family man overseeing his latest `mission' to provide a Christmas that he has never had.  The Audrey and Russ turn-over rate continues, this time with Juliette Lewis and the kid from Rosanne.  Beverly D'Angelo's Ellen returns, displaying her new face lift, can't even smile fully now, which is a pity.  The sight gags remain, but despite the presence of cousin-in-law Randy Quaid, this movie strives for and to some extent succeeds in giving us a more personal, intimate glimpse of Clark and the family dynamics.  I wouldn't consider this a classic, and it doesn't take the crown from the first film, but it does improve on the second's dreadful outing.	3.0	Low key but personable Griswold action.	2003-12-17	2	0	2

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3M60FEGHGRUCA	john thomas	With apologies to Jimmy Stewart and Ralphie Parker, this is my favorite Christmas movie of all time.  If you are reading this because you have never seen &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot;, stop right now and go to the video store and rent it.  Then come back here and order your own copy because you'll want to watch it over and over again each holiday season.The undisputed gem of the National Lampoon 'Vacation' series, the plot can be summed up very simply:  idealistic family man Clark Griswold wants to host the perfect old-fashioned fun family Christmas.  As all of us idealistic family men have discovered, there is no such thing as a perfect holiday, and that just about sums it up.  The appeal of this film is that we can all relate to the disasters that holidays can become, regardless of how well-meaning we are and how hard we work to achieve them.The cast is terrific.  Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen) are back as the Griswolds, with Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki assuming the roles of Audrey and Rusty.  John Randolph and Diane Ladd are Clark's parents, while E.G. Marshall and the ultimate mother-in-law, Doris Roberts are Ellen's parents.  Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss are Todd and Margo, the yuppie neighbors.  William Hickey and Mae Questel (the voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl) nearly steal the show as Uncle Lewis and senile Aunt Bethany.  Randy Quaid does steal the show - his &quot;cousin-in-law&quot; Eddie is one of the all-time great characters in recent comedy history.The self-inflicted situations that befall Clark in his holiday quest are peppered with memorable dialogue and slapstick, yet believable enough to bring flickers of recognition to most viewers.  Witness his mishaps on the roof putting up the lights; getting trapped in the attic; spending his Christmas bonus before he gets it; dealing with his snooty neighbors; and getting hilariously tongue-tied at the lingerie counter and being remarkably eloquent when he gets his &quot;bonus&quot;.  Admit it.  We've all been there.A holiday movie should be one that holds up to repeated viewings, and this one does.  Besides the excellent cast and the familiar situations, there is a great score by Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks), the animated opening credits sequence, and some fine tunes such as &quot;Hey Santa Claus&quot; by the Moonglows!  There are numerous little touches that you might not catch the first several times - check out the shape of the packages in Mr. Shirley's office when Clark gives him his gift, and see what happens to the light bulbs Clark puts in the cart at the Wal-Mart.I suspect, like in our home, &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; has become a sort of institution in many homes each holiday season.  We like to get together with friends to watch it, with everyone dressing as a character from the movie.  We eat green jello with &quot;cat food&quot; in it, stand and join in the Pledge of Allegiance and the Star Spangled Banner, recite the lines along with the characters, and give thanks that our holidays are at least a little better than the Griswolds'.	5.0	It's Christmas, and We're All in Misery . . . .	2000-12-30	154	142	12

This is such a realistic (in a way)  view about the holidays, being a kid, being a grown-up, and just dealing with some of the iirritating, crazy making experiences we have probably all dealt with at one time or another!

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AVE2J7PNE0L9C	J. Parmelee	Let me say this is the first movie from the line of National Lampoon's Vacation movies that I've seen. I saw this with my family the year it was released with my family at the Cinema 12 in Muskegon which is now called the Cinema Carousel and we've watched it every December since. Having said that I watch this movie on my own any month of the year I want to as I now own it for myself. Teenagers will relate to the charachter of Audrey, pre teens will relate to Rusty, and many adults will relate to the stress Clark Griswold has at being such an everyman who tries to keep the family together while having a few disasters commited by him or herself plus the rest of the goofy relatives.Now that I'm old enough to do so I also own the original Vacation which came out the year after I was born as well as European Vacation which came out not so long after but Christmas Vacation was and still is the best of the series. It's good for laughs at Holiday time or any other time of the year. My favorite scene? The squirrel and dog chase. My reason for that is a squirrel got into our house the year before the movie came out and our family's comments at that time were like lines out of the movie. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that young kids or easily offended people should steer clear of it but for those of us who understand the humor and relate to it it's an absolute must have.	5.0	A great holiday classic that you shouldn't let your toddlers see.	2010-12-14	0	0	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3HJN6JVXMG50C	"J. P. Meyers ""Movie Fan"""	After watching this year after year with my brother-in-law, it seemed just perfect that he gave me my own copy of the DVD when I went out to live on my own!  How excited I was to sit down one night with dinner and this movie, to listen to what I thought would be a tremendous commentary on the movie's background, technical features and trivia.Not so.  First off, there were a lot of people talking on the commentary track, so many that I couldn't keep track of who was saying what.  Then, the content was definitely nothing special.  It seemed almost like they didn't know what to say, so they just filled it up with comments about Beverly D'Angelo's hair or other stupid things.  Plus, since this commentary track was obviously added long after the movie was made, most of the people involved had forgotten most of what it was like to make the film.I also think that this film deserved a few better extras than just the commentary track.  Any outtakes or deleted scenes out there?  How about even a few bios of the cast and crew, especially since this was an early film for many actors who went on to bigger and better things?Now, the movie itself . . . a Christmas classic, of course.  My family watches it yearly around Thanksgiving, and my brother-in-law and I actually quote Randy Quaid throughout the year to one another.  We love the humor because, in each one of these characters, we find someone that we know in our own family.Because it is such a beloved family movie of ours, I have to give it at least four stars.  Like many other people here have said . . . if you don't own a copy of the movie yet, go ahead and grab one.  If you do have a copy, you aren't missing much.	4.0	Great Movie -- Sorry DVD	2005-03-13	0	0	0
079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A33UOIP7UFFURZ	J. Preece	I'm only rating the quality of the Blu Ray here (the movie is a true 5-star classic!), as I found the video quality on the Blu Ray to be quite poor.  Very grainy and you can really see a lot of the flaws in the original film recording.  I know the producers can only do so-much to improve upon a movie that was not filmed in Hi-Def, but there are movies from the same era (like Planes, Trains, and Automobiles) that are superior in video and audio quality on Blu Ray.  I think they needed to spend more time remastering the original film for Blu Ray.	3.0	Great movie but far from Hi-Def Quality Video	2013-01-10	0	0	0

I am however very disappointed in the dvd version of this movie.  Fortunately,I only paid seven dollars for the movie or I would be very upset.  The movie seems as if they took a regular vhs copy of the flick and scanned it and burned some copies.  I only had to watch about five minutes of the movie to see that Warner Brothers did nohing to restore this movie to a near perfect condition which dvd users are used to.  Im very disappointd and expected so much more from this movie.	3.0	Terrible DVD	2001-10-27	32	26	6

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AYVQMWDUSGL2C	jude pepper	"i must confess a certain weakness for the so-stupid-it's-funny school of comedy, and the approach has certainly been of some use to the VACATION franchise. but alas, as i hardly need to tell you, there are times when they only get halfway there, if you get my drift. you know a film is in trouble when it comes billed as a comedy and the funniest thing in it - the Griswold station wagon getting pinned under a semi trailer - comes and goes in the first ten minutes.it's hard to say why it didn't work. maybe it's simply an anticlimax for the Griswold family not to be travelling. one particularly stingy piece of salt in the wound is that Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis are hands-down the least appealing set of Griswold kids. come to think of it, casting is a major hindrance. an awful lot of actors who's speciality is obnoxiousness - Doris Roberts, William Hickey, Julia Louis-Dreyfruss, Brian Doyle-Murray, Sam MacMurray - are given entirely too much room swing the muscles in question. there are just too many UNlikable people in this house.it also doesn't help that this one throws the ""gross-out comedy"" element up to eleven, cheifly through Randy Quaid. the Cousin Eddie character was of course designed as low class in the first place, but he officially becomes technically disgusting here, naming his dog after it's sinus condition and gushing enthusiasm for emptying the toilet tank of his RV. ""gross-out comedy"" is one of the all-time champion oxymorons. i'm not keen on it at the best of times, and it certainly has no place amongst the holidays.and don't EVEN get me started on the truly disturbing signature moment, where the Christmas tree electrocutes the cat. in the first VACATION, they could get away with killing the dog because it was an obnoxious, snarling little monster, and it was frankly a relief to be rid of it. this cat, however, is a complete innocent who's major ""sin"" is happening to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. maybe it was just as tasteless to drive off having forgotten to unhook that dog from the back bumper, but at least that was a mercy killing, not a murder.all of which is utterly imcompatible with the flipside of the film. there are attempts at the obligatory Christmas movie ""heart"" as Clark looks forward to his Christmas bonus and Cousin Eddie's family frets about his unemployment. watching the two elements utterly fail to gibe makes you wanna scream ""hey, director, MAKE UP YOUR MIND!!"" obviously the goal here is the sort of sentimental irreverence which A CHRISTMAS STORY manages so artfully. to describe this film as falling short of that standard would be like saying ""being decapitated could ruin your whole day.""eight years or so later, VEGAS VACATION came along.thanks to a number of factors - it being Episode 4, how long it had been, that it's a comedy not a drama - you can debate just how worthy that film was. but VEGAS was distinct blessing in one sense, namely that it enabled the franchise to go out on a higher note than this would've been."	1.0	In This Case Just Stay Home...	2013-07-01	10	2	8

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AI2PF33TWL1FF	"Kevin Jackson ""kopitekev"""	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a movie that never fails to score top marks every time. Even the truly horrible, full screen disc that was released a few years couldnt detract from the movie itself. When a 'Special Edition' was announced earlier this year, I was overjoyed! At last, this classic movie is going to get the teatment it deserves. Two discs, Widescreen, Commentary, trailers, making of, behind the scenes, interviews and deleted footage. But, lo and behold, when the 'Special Edition' arrived at my house, all it contained was the Widescreen version and Commentary. Nothing that would make it a special edition! On both DVD realeases there is a shot of the Griswolds collecting their Christmas tree with the site owner. This scene isn't included even though it was shot! Why include this shot on the packaging if it isn't in the finished movie? And why oh why are there no deleted scenes? If you have the fullscreen edition, it is a worthwhile investment to buy this disc (I can't call it a special edition) if only for the Widescreen element. All in all, Warners still treat this title with the contempt it totally doesnt deserve. And its even in a snap case not the better plastic cases that Warners are supposed to be using now! Hopefully by 2010, we will have disc that we truly can call 'Special Edition'.	5.0	Classic Christmas Movie, Rubbish Special Edition!	2003-10-10	8	8	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AATS9Q7VJ4PFI	Kevin R. Austra	"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION is one of those films that gets better over time.  Way back in December 1989, I approached this movie with some apprehension.  I thoroughly enjoyed the original VACATION film, but the absolutely horrible EUROPEAN VACATION seemed to spell doom for any future movies.  Fortunately for Chevy Chase, the FLETCH movies came along.However, CHRISTMAS VACATION was a pleasant surprise.  Okay, the soundtrack could have been more exiting and the tempo of the film would have been better if raised to the pitch of VACATION, but overall it was not a bad job.Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase reprise their roles for a third time as Ellen and Clark Griswold.  Like their previous adventures, Clark sets out to create the perfect family event.  Unfortunately, his attempt to create a festive holiday environment turn out to be the recipe for near disaster.  Add some colorful relatives and Clark's klutzy accidents and you have CHRISTMAS VACATION.The best selling point of the picture is the potrayal, albeit exaggerated, of what happens when you fill a household with relatives.This DVD rates a spot alongside of other ""new"" classics like HOME ALONE."	4.0	A Must-See Every Holiday Season	2005-11-28	3	2	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3AP6H48QHX8BR	"Kimberly M. ""Kimberly"""	"I heard reviewers- claim that the movie is the best in the vacation series, I can't complain but this movie stands on its own. What are the holidays without caosis??? Every year we continually try to strive for a memorable Christmas.Well Clark GrIswols is no differant- but his good intentions go array in a hillarity of events from a physcotic squrriel to hillibily cousins-in-law to dried up turkeys and police busts. This Christmas IS hillarous. Clark Griswold sets out to make the perfect Christmas only problem is he FORGOT that means you also have to have family involved-dealing with the in-laws, and children is ALWAYS hard.He does his best lighting up the house so litterally it can be seen from outer-space. When Eddie his hillibee family show up things quickly go down hill. They have a disgusting dog, wildly children, and a bunch of character traits Clark can't stand. Making this Christmas HELL. But, even worse is Clark's fear that the pool he has already payed for will ruin him since, he hasn't recieved his bonus yet- making him TOATLLY on edge and unable to deal. But, what Clark dosn't realize is the imperfections in this Christmas are what are turning it into a Christmas no one will ever forget.Christmas Vacation exposes the crazyiness of the holidays and makes you realize that the imperfections in the holidays are what make it enjoyable. At the end when Clark says ""I did it"" you can't help but agree that this Christmas is one that will stay with you a long time. This movie is a great family Christmas flick to watch again and again especially during the holidays. All in all a great addition to your must watch Christmas list!"	4.0	Movie Stands On It's Own	2005-12-28	3	1	2

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2XT5OR3AR1PU2	KRA	"It's funny, some people have reacted very negativly towards this movie, as if it mocks the sacred ritual of a family Christmas. To those folks I first say, get real, then I challenge anyone to claim that they never experienced a Christmas that was at least going in the direction of this already classic tale.In this movie we are back with this Griswold's, this time at home, and Clark plots to create the uiltimate, old fashiond, fun, family Christmas. Need we say more.From a run in with rednecks while they are tree hunting, to Clark's stringing up the outside lights, to a house full of often disinterested in-laws (VERY typical of our parents generation). Clark brings new meaning to the phrase, ""no good dead goes unpunished"".As noted by other reviewers, Randy Quaid is a standout as cousin Eddie, and his powder blue Leisure Suit. However he is almost trumped by the next door yuppie, Margo, played by Julia Dryfuss (Seinfeld's Elaine). Yes, someone played her husband, but Margo truly ruled her all too trendy roost. As a Christmas present to us all Margo has an encounter with a squirel, and then Decks The Hall with her husband, Todd.Is there a lesson here?, yes, think hard and fast before planning your own fun, old fashioned, family Christmas. Although this movie has the true to form, Hollywood Happy Ending, not all fun, old fashioned, family Christmasses end happy.However, most imporatntly, this movie is a comedy, and enjoy it as such. A great feature of Christmas Vacation is that you could watch this movie every night for a week, and still pick out something new. Watch for the scene in the house with the TV broadcasting the Chicago Christmas Parade, and the now legendary scene with Clark shopping at Marshall Feild's.I noticed that you can buy this DVD in a bundle pack with the more recent movie, A Christmas Story. Sorry, but in my opinion, A Christmas Story is the most annoying Christmass movie EVER.A better choice for a Christmas Double feature?, pair this with the true classic, Miracle on 34th Street (see my review), or the campy, often overlooked, Christmas In Connecticut."	5.0	A Modern (and truer) Christmas Tale	2005-11-20	4	3	1

The Santa hat that comes with it comes in a vacuum sealed bag witch is good and bad the bad the white lining has a faint red color in a spot or two but its light and silky to the touch, coasters are great to bring out for the holidays, snow is still in the box and will continue to stay there. The button is a cool little price of memorabilia. So it is worth the low price of this item.	5.0	You don't need me to tell you.	2012-12-20	1	0	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3TDW3TDZKUVJ	Leah-S	I bought the BluRay version & watched it this past Christmas, it works perfectly! I can finally watch this without missing parts & getting frustrated by it skipping.Overall: Awesome! Very fair price, I highly recommend the BluRay version.*IMPORTANT: My low rating (initially 1/5) had NOTHING to do with the movie/storyline itself, but was strictly based on the actual DVD.I bought the Special Edition (2003) DVD several years ago for my mom as a pre-Christmas present; it's one of our all-time favorites to watch around the holidays. Unfortunately, the movie cut out in 2 different places, the first cut is when Clark plugs in the house lights (hilarious!) & the second was near the end, it skipped so far that it jumped to the end credits, we missed a good 5-10 minutes. My family is careful when handling DVDs, so no, this isn't related to scratches or fingerprints; in saying that, I still tried cleaning the DVD anyways with no success.	5.0	AVOID: Special Edition (2003) DVD, it skips.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AIK0KMPBE9DIZ	lemme14	First off, let me tell you that I love this movie.  It is, quite frankly, the best Christmas movie there is.  The comedy is non-stop from beginning to end.  This time of year, we watch it 3 or 4 times before Christmas, including on Christmas Eve.  Having said that, the Blu-Ray version is no better than the standard DVD.  The video is so-so, the audio is terrible (Dolby 2.0), and there are no extras.  Maybe I shouldn't expect more, after all, the movie is from 1989.  However, in releasing a Blu-Ray, I think people do expect better quality.  If you are buying this movie for the first time and can get a good deal on the Blu-Ray, go for it.  If you are thinking of replacing the standard DVD with a Blu-Ray, save your money for something else.	2.0	Blu-Ray.  Really??	2010-12-24	1	1	0

Our family watches every year at Christmas. It's fantastic. Chevy Chase's efforts to put on a family Christmas are hilarious, and the visiting family really make the movie. Lieing around as a family on Christmas Day, and letting all the good food digest, while laughing at other's misfortunes is perhaps not in the spirit of Christmas, but it's how it works at our house. ""Drumroll please..."" and ""Shitter's full!"" are hollered across the loungeroom by all always a couple of seconds before the actors say it on screen.

I especially like when he needs an aspirin after a very long rant, as anyone that has done anything similar will be able to relate to the headaches the ranting causes.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A294PVV990FBTV	LT4CE	"""Christmas Vacation""(CV) is one of our favorite  Christmas movies, along with ""A Christmas Story""(ACS), so I was anxiously looking forward to watching them in HD.  We were terribly disappointed when we saw CV!  Instead of a sharp, vibrant picture as we have seen in other redone oldies, this was grainy and dull (unlike ACS).  After watching it, I put my non HD dvd of CV in the HD player, and saw little difference in picture quality. At times I felt the non HD version had better color!!??ACS was like watching an entirely new movie, however, and I could see many things clearly for the first time in the HD version.I rated CV 2 stars simply because I love the story, but would rate it as zero stars for HD quality!What happened WB?Update: After posting this review, I sent an email to Warner Bros complaining about the quality. I receved a prompt reply with instructions as to how to get a prepaid return envelope to WB so they could replace it. Dubious, I followed the instructions, returned the DVD, and received a new one after a week or so. Yesterday, still dubious, I watched it. OK, now I have a good quality HD version of Christmas Vacation - just what you would expect from an HD-DVD. Thanks WB! I would now rate it as 5 stars."	2.0	Worst Quality HD-DVD so far!	2006-12-28	11	9	2

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AOUGOGKQRNI13	Lydia Habbershaw	"This movie should be mandatory viewing for every household that celebrates any holiday.  It is the perfect example of ""there is no such thing as the perfect holiday"".  Every December 15th I sit down with presents to my left, wrapping paper to my right, and turn on this movie as I start wrapping presents.  When the movie is over, I re-wind and play it again - and again - and again.  I've worn out three VHS tapes, and I'm working on my old DVD version.  I plan to get this new WIDESCREEN version as soon as it hits the shelves.  It keeps the holiday season in perspective for me - that there really is no such thing as a ""perfect"" holiday gathering.Clark W. Griswold wants one thing in life -- The Perfect Christmas.  What he gets is an hilarious mixture of uninvited relatives, feuding in-laws, cheapskate bosses, yuppie-neighbors, rampaging dogs, feisty squirrels, insensitive visitors, a dead cat, and one heck of a wild ride on a bobsled!!!For anyone that has ever wanted to have a perfect holiday, you must see this movie!!!

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A26ZSYRPA1TCI5	Marc Dalesandro	"The best of the Vacation movies, Christmas Vacation ranks right up there with ""The Three Amigos"", ""Caddyshack"", and ""Fletch"" as one of Chevy Chase's best films. Chase can't take all the credit, however, as the fantastic cast (including Randy Quaid and a young Juliette Lewis) works perfectly to produce some incredibly hilarious scenes.One of the true classics of Christmas, this comedy should be essential viewing at each Yuletide season. And, while the DVD extras are sparse, it's the movie itself that really matters. And, in this case, the movie works perfectly.For having almost no flaws, and for providing years of holiday entertainment for the whole family, Christmas Vacation gets five stars!"	5.0	Is this the airport, Clark?	2005-12-23	6	6	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A20YK8VEEOIJQE	"Mark C. Jones ""Be Cool"""	If you like the original Vacation, you'll like Christmas Vacation. The humor is cruder and more exaggerated than in the original. Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) is given a more prominent role and he pretty much takes over the second half of the movie. Chase is great as Clark Griswold. The supporting cast is also excellent.	4.0	Chevy Chase In The Role He Was Born To Play (and perhaps the only role he was born to play)	2014-03-02	0	0	0

Many families are attracted to these films and would rather live without most (or even all) of the bad language.

I wanted a widescreen HD version.  I found this Blu-ray version on Amazon and placed my order.  My two complaints: video quality and ""widescreen"".  The video quality is slightly better than my DVD at best.  The ""widescreen"" was the bigger problem.  I assumed this would be a re-release of the original theatrical widescreen version - it isn't.  They have actually cropped the top and bottom off of the 4:3 DVD version to make it pseudo-widescreen.  My Blu-ray now has less of the original movie than the 4:3 version has - it has been cropped twice.

The movie is a bit dated and it could certainly do without a lot of the suggestive scenes and profanity otherwise it's fun it watch as Clark Griswold leads a train wreck ensemble cast through a series of holiday mishaps whilst hilarity ensues.  I would love to see a remake of this movie someday but it would be hard to find someone with Chevy's sense of comical timing.

Chevy Chase is back once more, and from the previous ones I've seen, it's the most disappointing. There are a few funny moments, but they were predictable. How many times can you watch someone stapling Christmas lights (talk about going overboard with THOSE!) without knowing they're going to attach themselves to the roof, and then fall off the ladder? Having the dreaded family over makes me wish I'm not going anywhere this Christmas! You've got all the worst family members you can possibly imagine ... and then add some! The mum is at her best in this film, and the children are Juliette Lewis is an early role, but still looking &amp; sounding the same, and the guy who later got a fish hook through the neck in I Know What You Did Last Summer. This isn't my fave National Lampoon Movie/Vacation movie. But it's a great movie to watch at this time of year - even though I keep complaining that I'm watching Christmas movies in the middle of November, and I want it to be Christmas NOW!!!	4.0	Another Great Xmas Movie	2003-11-19	10	3	7

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A5EBS3LXG8GB	"Melvin D. Escobar ""Melvin"""	"4.5 stars.  I would have to say that this is my favorite Christmas movie.  My wife and I picked up the DVD Special Edition (which isn't that special, come to think about it -- just one trailer and a commentary track).It's rated PG-13.  I didn't remember anything all that caustic in it, so we let our four year old watch it.  Yikes.  There is a lot of swearing in this movie.  At one point, our daughter looked at us, giggled, and said ""That man said bull sit!""  That's what she really said, but that wasn't what the man said.So, I'm in the dog house tonight because it was my idea to watch it.  Please, avoid this predicament by screening this movie if you aren't sure you want your kids using the words that the actors use.That said, I love the heck out of this movie.  It is well-acted, and well-scripted.  There are a lot of great bits such as the cat under the chair, the sled, the squirrel in the tree, Cousin Eddie and the sewer drain.... the list goes on and on.If you have never seen this movie, I suggest you buy it right now and watch it without delay.  Anyone that has ever attended a family Christmas will find a lot to laugh about.  If you haven't seen it in awhile, same thing.  This is a must-see Christmas movie on par, I think, with ""A Christmas Story."""	4.0	Excellent except for language	2005-12-05	2	2	0

I am this years Santa and if you don't think I see everything, guess again! Oh yes. I see you decorating trees, rushing and scurrying at the mall, knocking other people down to get to that last sale item. Then your anger reaches a fever pitch when you can't remember and can't find where you parked the car. Oh yes. From my green and red condo at the North Pole (which Santa generously let me use until Christmas Eve), I see all. Don't think for one minute naughty or nice doesn't apply right now. Elves are terrible gossips and will advise me up til the last minute.I settled down with some brandy and this ""Christmas Vacation"" DVD. Now, I know there are many Christmas movies out there that are attuned to some type of emotion. Some will make you feel joy and some will amuse and delight you. However, none of them stand up to the hysterical escapade that this movie represents. This is one of Chevy Chase's finest moments in comedy, playing the Christmas foil wrapping to our delight. I never fail to watch this at this time of year. It is essential. Revealing the essence of Christmas with all the absurd elements that truly do make it the unique holiday that it is.Chevy plays Clark Griswold, looking forward to his bonus check and a family reunion, inviting all the relatives to his home. The movie starts out with his car getting trapped underneath a truck and, from there, you know you are in for more disaster.The rapid-fire changing situations hit more often than miss your funny bone. Sometimes, you border on being hysterical with laughter. Yes, it is that funny. So many scenes that are good no matter how much you watch it.Some of my favorites? Chevy at a department store speaking to a hot woman at the lingerie counter. The naughty word play is just too funny, time and time again. (This young lady appears later in a scene whereby Chevy looks out at the imaginary in ground pool he plans to build, sees her, and his eye-bulging look as she whips her bikini at the window). As clever as your Metamorpho is, I don't know if I could come up with this on my best day.Do not forget his aunt's cat chewing on wires, the exploding turkey (with puffs of steam) and the squirrel who wrecks havoc and is the last straw for his tortured yuppie neighbors. There is just so much fun to this movie, and total disaster has never been more uproarious.I cannot tell you of each funny scene, but you must see it because this movie is definitely unique within this genre. So, put it on as you wrap your gifts. Just remember, the cat and jello are off limits!Drive my gift to my front door....Ornamentally yours -- Metamorpho ;)"	5.0	Christmas is my Name, Disaster is my Game....	2008-12-18	2	2	0
079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AMG2LF8MLUDN1	M. Fields	The poor Griswold family just can't seem to get anything quite right.  Full of family problems and egg nog, I must agree with some of my fellow reviewers that this is the best of the Griswold series.  There are some real laugh out loud moments here.  It's a zany romp through one family's Christmas holiday.All Clark Griswold wants is to have a good old fashioned Christmas holiday with the family.  What he gets is a tree that's too big for the house, an over crowded house full of both sets of grandparents, an unwelcome cousin and his family, a big dog, a crazy squirrel, a mean old uncle and his forgetful wife, a dead cat, a trashed house, a kidnapped boss, an invasion by aswat team, and an explosion, just to name a few items.Parents beware, there is a small amount of profanity.  There is no nudity or sexual content.  There is some mild violence.  While I didn't rate this one with 5 stars, I still believe that it is worthy of having a place in your Christmas dvd collection.Enjoy!	4.0	A very Griswold Christmas	2004-11-05	2	2	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"In 1983, theater audiences were treated to the outrageous comedy ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" featuring the fictional Griswold family thanks to the superb writing by John Hughes and direction by Harold Ramis.  In that film, the head of the Griswold household, Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Jr. (Chevy Chase), is determined to take his family on the best vacation ever by driving them from their home in the Chicago suburbs to the fictional amusement theme park in California known as Wally World.  However, things don't quite go the way that Clark had intended along the way.  Two years later, the Griswolds returned to the big screen in the rather disappointing ""National Lampoon's European Vacation"", which was directed by Amy Heckerling and co-written by John Hughes and Robert Klane.  Four years later (1989), under the direction of Jeremiah S. Chechik and solely written by John Hughes, the return of the Griswold family in ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" was again as funny and well-written as their original 1983 film.Similar to the original ""National Lampoon's Vacation"", in ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" Clark Griswold is determined that his family will have a traditional Christmas celebration at their home in the Chicago suburbs and invites his parents and his in-laws.  Clark's wife, Ellen Griswold (Beverly D'Angelo, who was also in the previous two films), does not share his obsessive enthusiasm, but goes along with him, including making a trip to the mountains to chop down their own Christmas tree.  Accompanied by their children, Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki), to the mountains, the trip is hilarious as it doesn't go quite the way that Clark planned.  For outdoor decorations, Clark uses a ridiculous 25,000 lights to transform the Griswold home into what he thinks is the ideal Christmas setting.  Then, unexpectedly and uninvited, good ol' Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid, who was also in the original film) shows up with his peculiar family in their broken-down RV, which he parks in front of Clark's home.  More laughs ensue when Clark's parents, Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Sr. (John Randolph, 1915-2004) and Nora Griswold (Diane Ladd), and his in-laws, Art (E.G. Marshall) and Frances (Doris Roberts, better-known for her portrayal of Marie Barone in the TV sitcom ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", 1996-2005), arrive, as well as the cigar-smoking Uncle Lewis (William Hickey, 1928-1997) and Aunt Bethany (1908-1998).  With an electric-cord-chewing cat, a flaming Christmas tree, a disappointing Christmas bonus, family fighting and a SWAT team, ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is sure to make you laugh and encourage you to plan your own traditional, old-fashioned family Christmas celebration.Other memorable characters in ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" include Cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn, who was in the original film), Cousin Rocky (Cody Burger), Cousin Ruby Sue (Ellen Hamilton Latzen), neighbor Todd Chester (Nicholas Guest), his wife Margo Chester (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Bill (Sam McMurray), Mary (Nicolette Scorsese), Clark's boss Mr. Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray, who played the Kamp Komfort manager in the original film) and his wife Mrs. Helen Shirley (Natalia Nogulich).  Overall, I rate ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone."	5.0	"""I dedicate this house to the Griswold Family Christmas."""	2004-11-15	7	5	2

While some gags are in questionably good taste, they are funny and Chase has a fine cast of supporting players including Randy Quaid as the redneck Eddie; the parents:  John Randolph, Diane Ladd, Doris Roberts and E.G. Marshall; and Julia Louis Dreyfus as the snooty neighbor.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3A1TOAHRR60UE	Michael J. Marshall	A Classic that I grew up with... National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has been on every holiday season since I was about 8 years old; and even today I use it to mark the beginning of the season- It's not Christmas time until Christmas Vacation has been on!My wife, several years younger than I; doesn't give this movie a fair chance and tries to write it off as being somewhat trashy.  It really is not; instead it is real life situations, along with a string of misfortunes, to torment a true family man who wants nothing more than to give his whole family a warm beautiful joyous Christmas.Another plus to this particular title is that you do not need to be a fan / follower of the other National Lampoon's Vacation movies... Not only do the Griswald's not travel anywhere like they do in the others... Someone with no idea who Clark, Ellen, Rusty, or Audrey Griswald are can sit down and fall in love with the family right away.  And- while this movie did sneak out just before the 80's ended (1989), it does have a much more modern look than the other Vacation movies, and the casting of the kids was spot-on; as I always related well to the Russ of this movie, but did not to the others.Anyways...  Watch it, watch it a few times this holiday season.  If by some chance you have a wife or girlfriend who doesn't know the film, 'tis the season to be Merry!Side Note--- My name is Michael, but thanks to this movie my Dad has often called me &#34;Russ&#34; shouting out things like &#34;Settle down Russ&#34; though-out the years; in reference to this movie.If you watch this movie and are disappointed, well, I wouldn't be more surprised than.... &#34;if I woke up tomorrow morning with my head sewn to the carpet&#34;.	5.0	"Classic Status Attained - It's Not Christmas Without ""Christmas Vacation"""	2013-11-19	0	0	0

Even my wife likes this movie, and she is usually not into these types of movies at all.For those who have been under some rock, this movie features the continuing store of Clark W. Griswald and his crazy family adventures.  Chevy Chase still headlines, as does the same actress that played his wife in Vacation and European Vacation, but once again the kids were flipped out with new talent (probably because the old ones got too old).  The movie follows Clark as he tries to make the perfect family Christmas.  Loads of great, funny scenes.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	ANWKY1WS0Z9M0	Mike H	My review focuses primarily on the Bluray disc specifically. The movie is a 5/5 but the Bluray loses a star for not being superior in anyway to a DVD.THE GOOD: Overall, this is a modern Christmas classic and one of Chevy Chase's best. The film still holds up over 20 years later and is still heavily enjoyable.THE BAD: However unless the DVD looked downright dreadful, the Bluray isn't very impressive. It doesn't seem like a newer digital transfer, as the video looks like something you'd see on regular TV, It's certainly no better than a DVD. If you already own the DVD version of this film, it's doubtful that the Bluray's video quality is anything better than what you already have (assuming your DVD player is capable of up scaling to 1080).The special features are pretty much non-existent, sans a commentary track and a theatrical trailer.Ultimately: If you have the DVD, but were thinking on upgrading to the Bluray, don't. If you don't have either, and the DVD is cheaper (and your DVD player can up-convert to 1080) then you might as well just get the DVD. The Bluray isn't any better or worse.	4.0	Christmas Classic, but BluRay isn't perfect	2012-12-16	3	3	0
079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR	"Mike London ""MAC"""	"First off, let's get the technical Blu-Ray stuff out of the way.  Warner Brothers have released some truly lackluster editions of the ""Vacation"" series, and unfortunately ""Christmas Vacation"" is no exception.  The ""Ultimate Edition"" Blu-Ray copy released in 2009  featuring the newer, green jewel case is the exact same copy (with only the blue color case changed) that Warner Bros. released in 2006.The picture quality never really becomes alive like you would expect from a Blu-ray, and is rather drab to say the last.  The 1.85:1 non-anamorphic print is about the same as the Special Edition, and there isn't the same amount of crispness and clarity that should be present for a high definition transfer.  Several sequences suffer from some rather dark video, and the audio is the Dolby Digital 2.0 Stero track from the original DVD releases.  Subtitles and mono tracks are available in French and Spanish.Special features include a full length audio commentary by Jeremiah Chechik (director), Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold), Miriam Flynn (Cousin Katherine), Johnny Galecki (Rusty Griswold), Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie), and producer Matty Simmons.  Notably absence is Chevy Chase.  The commentary isn't that revelatory but is passable as far as commentaries go.  For all the complainining about Chase not being on the commentary, this group commentary is miles [infinitely] better than the ""European Vacation"" commentary, which ONLY featured Chase.  Matty does reveal the studio nearly cut the fried cat scene, and only due to postive reaction from test audiences were they able to keep that in the movie.That leaves us with the physical merchandise: four coasters, ""I Survived A Griswold Family Christmas"" pin, a Santa hat, a small bag of snow powder ????, and a cheap plastic replica of the moose mug Clark and Eddie drink eggnog from.  Personally I wouldn't recommend getting the more expensive Blu-Ray versions of this movie - just pick up the cheaper editions.  You're pretty much getting the same product minus the physical merchandise.  Then again, who WOULDN'T WANT a small bag of fake snow powder and a cheap plastic Marty Moose mug?  That being said, let's move onward to the review.""I don't know what to say, except it's Christmas and we're all in misery."" No words were more aptly spoken.  After the rather disappointing misfire of ""European Vacation"", John Hughes and Chevy Chase return Clark W. Griswold to his former glory.  Hilarious, extremely relatable, and just as good as the original ""Vacation"", ""Christmas Vacation"" is one of those instant secular Christmas classics that become a tradition for so many families, just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""A Christmas Story"" (a movie that personally I abhor).The movie features classic performances from Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, the in-laws, and the two Griswold children.  Brian Doyle-Murry (Bill Murray's older brother) also returns to the franchise as Frank Shirely, Clark W. Griswold's boss.  He appeared in ""Vacation"" in a brief scene as a Kamp Komfort clerk.  Doris Roberts (who plays Marie Barone on my all time favorite sitcom, ""Everybody Loves Raymond"") plays Frances, Ellen's mother.  Also a pre-Seinfield Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, along with Nicholas Guest, plays a rather yuppy, above it all couple by the names of Margo and Todd Chester who operate as a foil to Clark's outlandish behaviors.  They find Christmas cliche and are not observant of any holiday traditions.  Naturally they find it difficult living by the Grisworlds, and throughout the course of the film encounter several obstacles and even extensive property damage.Like the original ""Vacation"", why ""Christmas Vacation"" has become such an endurable holiday favorite is its relatability.  John Hughes was truly an absolutely hysterical guy, but he crafted his films and scripts in such a way that people from various walks of life can watch his films and instantly identify with the mad-cap hysterics taking place on screen.  Yet both the aforementioned Vacation movies transcend mere slapstick into something deeper.  Also notable is this is the only vacation movie that is set in Chicago wholly, as the Griswolds not traveling but rather staying home for Christmas.Like ""Vacation"", ""Christmas Vacation"" shows Clark W. Griswold as an over-idealistic sentamentalist who just wants to give his family the best Christmas vacation ever, despite his zany, over the top antics and the ""threshold of hell"" that so frequently occurs.  We've all been in family gatherings that have gone ary.  Everything that goes wrong pretty much does, from a fried pussy cat, a burning Christmas tree, overbearing relatives, malfunctioning decorations, and bad relations with your neighbors.  Yet despite all his difficulties, ultimately Clark W. Griswold prevails in treating his family to a great Christmas vacation.The real strength of both ""Vacation"" and ""Christmas Vacation"" is that, at its heart, we see the Clark truly wanting the best for his family, and though the Griswolds are long suffering, ultimately they know the meaning of family unity and togetherness.  Hughes is a sentimentalist, and as both this film and ""Home Alone"" show, like Dickens' Ebeneezer Scrooge, he knows Christmas and keeps it well.As this is more of an adult comedy under the National Lampoon moniker, ""Christmas Vacation"" does feature some racier elements.  While there is no nudity like the first two films, there are numerous profanities scattered throughout, including the infamous ""We're gonna press on, and we're gonna have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny f---ing Kaye!""  Audrey also tells her mother she has nightmares about what Rusty does alone in his bed at night when she is not lying in bed next to him (referring to masturbation).  When Eddie arrives, he talks to Clark about how big the dog's testicles are, and says he has some ""Mississippi Leg Hound"".  Eddie tells Clark that if the dog begins humping his leg, he should allow the dog to continue until climax and then clean off his jeans from the dog's . . . sex cells.Also continuing a character thread from the first film, we see that Clark not only flirts with a store clerk he meets early on in the film, but has an elaborate fantasy regarding the clerk Mary naked in a swimming pool midway through.  The film shows Mary getting out of the pool in a head and neck shot, but before her breasts are seen Ruby Sue, Eddie's daughter, comes in and interrupts Clark's fantasy.  There is also an extended shot of Eddie dropping raw sewage into Clark's sceptic system.The film opens with Clark, with family in tow, going out to pick out a Christmas tree.  One notable mention is this opening sequence mark's the film's ONLY reference to Jesus Christ, the true reason for the season.  There are no nativity scenes or other religious referneces, etc, which is somewhat strange given the overtly religious nature of the origin for Christmas.  Even Kevin McCallister in ""Home Alone"" (another John Hughes movie, made a year after ""Christmas Vacation"") hides in a nativity scene and goes to church.  Clark and his family memorably have an almost horrible wreck with some rednecks and gets lodged under a semi, before taking out a the Christmas lot sign.  Given Clark's driving record, he most have some truly expensive auto-insurance policies.  Upon arrival, they wander off into the woods, where Clark finds an enormous tree which he is adamant is the Griswold Family Christmas Tree!  Bringing no saw, Clark uproots the tree and drives the tree home, roots and all, strapped to his family truckster from the first film.The first half of the film sets up Clark and Ellen preparing for Christmas and the arrival of the in-laws.  So many of us can relate to those awkward family gatherings, and the Griswolds are no exceptions.  Roger Ebert in his review from 1989 critized the movie for the way Hughes handles the inlaws, saying they functioned more as a homogenous unit and serve as a backdrop to Chevy Chase's antics, much like the majority of the dwarves blending seamlessly into the background in Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"".  The in-laws never really distinguish themselves or make themselves notable in the script.I disagree rather strongly with this assessment.  While the main focus is indeed on Chase, there are many moments involving the in-laws that are not only quite funny but often quite realistic.  Hughes writes with an economy befitting an hour and a half comedy; he gets every bit that he can from both sets of grandparents and Uncle Lewis and Aunt Bethany (played by Mae Questral in her last film appearance, and the voice of Betty Boop).  Alas, as I have grown older I can truly relate to the rather sad state elderly people get into when they begin to experience dementia, Alzheimer's, and senility.Although the script is already crowded with these extra characters, one notable omission is the lack of any children, aunts and uncles.  As far as we know, Beverly and Clark were only children and Rusty and Audrey have no first cousins.  I think there could have been some memorable interactions had Hughes brought in some first cousins.Thoughout the first half, the in-laws arrive, Clark gets locked in the attic (and watches some old home movies, before being quite abruptly interrupted in a very funny, very painful moment), and struggles with the art of exterior illumination.  He meets an attractive sales clerk at the mall and tries to make himself visible to his boss in a good way, all the while failing miserably.  Another memorable line is when the parents arrive, Clark says ""Well I'm gonna park the cars and get the luggage, and well, I'll be outside for the season.""  I've known a few times when people (my father in particular) escape into other areas (outside, other parts of the house), to escape the chaos of the Christmas gatherings.In a memorable ensemble scene when Clark and Ellen finally get the thousands upon thousands of Christmas lights finally working, Clark hugs each family member and then moves on to Cousin Eddie, hoping the Christmas lights ""adds"" to Eddie and Katherine's festive cheer and enjoyment of the holiday season.  He then promptly realises that Eddie and Katherine are standing in his front yard and goes into shock.Randy Quaid deftly plays Cousin Eddie, the ultimate trailer-trash cousin.  Like Chevy Chase to Clark W. Griswold, Randy Quaid was tailor made for this role.  Having been out of work for seven years (he's holding out for a management position, Katherine informs Ellen), they have lost their farm from the first movie and are now living in an RV.  Katherine and Eddie had four children (and she was pregnant with a fifth) in the first movie.  Hughes promptly dispenses with the extra children and there are only two children present, Rocky and Ruby Sue, as Eddie explains the older ones are working in a carnival.  I also love when Clark says he and Ellen will be Eddie's children some Christmas presents (as Eddie doesn't have any presents for his children due to financial hardships), and Eddie says he wants Clark to buy himself a really nice present for being so generous.  Cracks me up!  The sled sequence is also quite funny.Cousin Eddie promptly interjects life into the second half of the movie.  While the first half leading up to Cousin Eddie's arrival are quite funny, Randy Quaid almost steals the show.  He just nails his performance wonderfully.  Redneck, broke, and just overall idiotic, Randy was born to play this role.  I've always been rather creeped out when Eddie tells Rusty ""Come on, let's go find your sister.""  Given that we know he french kisses his daughter from the first movie, the whole exchange just has a very creepy undercurrent.The squirrel scene is quite funny too.  Watching the movie on TV can lead to interesting cuts.  One of my favorites is when Clark's father is talking to Clark, and he asks his dad how his dad managed to make it through the holidays.  His father's answer: ""I had a lot of help from Jack Daniels"", at which they both laugh.  I've seen several cuts where they simply elimiate that last part ""from Jack Daniels"", completely ruining the joke.  Clark's reading of the ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" (barely begun and unfinished as the performance is) is another great moment.The main driving plot device that sets up the climax of the film is Clark has put down money for a new swimming pool but does not have the money to pay for the pool.  He is relying on his bonus to cover the costs.  As he has worked for his company for seventeen years and every one of those years he has gotten a bonus ensures that he has certainity [is certain] he will likewise get a bonus this year.  Ultimately we discover there is no forth-coming monetary bonus and is instead enrolled in a Jelly of the Month Club, which Eddie promptly points out is a gift that keeps giving the whole year through.Clark then memorably goes into probably the best single moment in the entire Vacation franchise, railing against his boss and how he wants him brought to Clark's house so he can tell his boss how worthless he is.  In a nod to the original, still unseen ending to ""Vacation"", where Clark kidnaps Roy Wally at his house, Cousin Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss Frank Shirley and brings him to Clark's residence.  A swat team promptly goes into rescue Frank Shirley and just like ""Vacation"", Shirley decides not to press charges and reinstates Clark's bonus, as well as the other employees' bonus.  In the end, Clark looks at the camera and says ""I did it"", showing he was successful in his aims at having a great Christmas after allOverall, a fantastic Christmas movie.  For those concerned with the profanity then watch the movie on one of the regular cable TV channels.  This is Hughes at his best.  If I had to choose between this and ""Vacation"", I'd give a (very, very) slight edge to ""Vacation"", but both are easily the best the Vacation franchise have to offer!"	5.0	"Clark: ""I dedicate this house to the Griswold Family Christmas.""

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A10MH3OBX7DBEY	M. J KILLEEN	One of Chevy's best -- and my personal favorite of the Vacation series. Clark Griswold is at his most well-intentioned but dim-witted best in this one. This movie has lots of strong gags throughout. Just when you think the story is about to lose steam, Randy Quaid shows up -- and the comedy goes to a whole new level. (My favorite scene is still the &quot;sled&quot; ride into traffic). Top notch supporting work from Beverly D'Angelo, and especially William Hickey and Mae Questel (as the great-grandparents).This DVD was made back in the days when &quot;extras&quot; meant trailers, and maybe some production notes. This is also a full-screen prsentation which is bad news for those of us who care about such things. Hopefully a &quot;Special Edition&quot; of this Christmas classic will be released with commentary from the stars, a widescreen picture and any out-takes that might possibly exist.	4.0	My favorite Xmas movie -- deserves a better DVD	2001-12-09	48	38	10

Subsequent to the release of this film, houses soon began Christmas-light makeovers, which I think really adds to the atmosphere of the season! Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are superb in this John Hughes classic Christmas comedy - as is Randy Quaid. Clark W Griswold Jnr is anxious to have the 'perfect' old fashioned, fun, family Chritmas. But, as usual, nothing goes according to plan: Getting stuck under a truck in the opening minutes... becoming psychotic over the failing of the thousands of lights he's added to the building... ruining the Christmas of Tod and Margo (their yuppie, bourgesois next door neighbours)...Eddie (Quaid) kidnapping Clark's boss because Clark didn't recieve his bonus cheque, needed to pay for a swimming pool...a storm sewer exploding (and the poor cat!)...the tree getting burnt...etc...Leading to the house teetering on 'the threshold of Hell'! There are many great moments in this movie. My personal favourite is when he takes Eddie and the kids sledging: a silicone-based kitchen lubricant Clark's company invented is smeared onto his sledge, propelling him like a rocket! The scenery is so Christmassy here. I have a selection of Christmas movies I stack around the video at this time of year. Christmas Vacation takes prime position. I have seen it *so* many times yet I am still not bored with it. Note: There is mild bad language in the PG version, but for those with younger children, some versions have worse. I really don't know why Hughes had to do this; this film could be accessible to all, as with Miracle On 34th Street (Hughes' remake). As is usual with John Hughes, those typical huge mansions (as with Home Alone, Ferris Bueller and Uncle Buck) feature. The photography is very Christmassy and it just might get you in the mood... The DVD has the trailer (including the other Vacation trailers), different language options, production notes etc... I am glad to have found a site that sells those reindeer egg nog glasses too!	5.0	A Christmas Classic!	2002-11-23	6	3	3

This is Chevy at his best. But the icing on the cake is Randy Quaids genius interpretation of that embarrassing relative we want to disclaim.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AP50P603W4BA7	"Ms. H. Sinton ""dragondrums"""	Festive mayhem in this comedy about the Griswald family Christmas. Clark Griswald (Chevy Chase) is determined his family are going to enjoy a traditional family Christmas whether they want to or not. In true 'National Lampoon' style, all does not go to plan with the usual hilarious results.From choosing the tree (which would fit better in Trafalgar Square!) to covering the entire house in fairy lights, and subsequently blowing the whole neighbourhoods lights, Clark manages to cause mayhem with whatever he touches.Things go from bad to worse when his uninvited slob of a cousin (Randy Quaid) arrives with his hillbilly family and mangy dog.This is great fun for all ages and a 'must watch' during the Christmas holidays.	5.0	Christmas comedy	2005-02-19	0	0	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A3EPHBMU07LZ50	Mysterious Reviewer	Watching this movie has become a family Christmas tradition as we always watch this movie. Every year like clockwork. We've even been known to watch it in July when it's so hot all we want to do is think about Christmas and cooler weather ahead.The characters are so true-to-life (albeit not exactly like everyone in your family) they will remind you of your crazy aunt and your nutty uncle. It will also bring home the reminder of neighbors who somehow try to out do one another in celebrating the Christmas spirit.The only drawback to this movie is some adult scenes and language that is better suited for mature audiences. I would not recommend watching this movie with young children but older teens would probably understand the adult humor.Highly recommend.	5.0	It wouldn't be Christmas without watching this movie	2010-12-10	0	0	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1D663YD036KNH	paperbackriter	Hands down the funniest Christmas movie of all-time! You've just got to pity poor Clark Griswald (Chevy Chase) who tries his darndest to host a &quot;fun-filled family Christmas&quot; only to be victimized by every disaster imaginable. Of course, it's all done for laughs and quite frankly, nearly every scene in &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; rates very high on the Laugh-O-Meter! This film makes light of the commercialism of Christmas -- be it the search for the perfect tree, waiting for that big year-end bonus at work, or the stress of shopping -- and twists it into a brilliant satire to which everyone can relate. But most of all, this is a movie about family, or more specifically, the family members we only see on &quot;special&quot; occasions. And my goodness, what a motley bunch the Griswalds are! In fact, Randy Quaid as the pea-brained, red-neck Cousin Eddie nearly steals the movie. Quaid doesn't merely light up the screen, he practically BLOWS it up every single second he is on camera. Everything about Eddie-- from his sauve selection of leisure suits to his filthy &quot;tenament on wheels&quot;-- is funny beyond imagination. The dialogue between Clark (the straight man) and Eddie is pure comic genius. Eddie, however, is merely a fool among many in &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot;. Everyone can relate to the fighting in-laws, the cheapskate boss, and the senile Aunt Bethany and Uncle Louis as they all wreak havoc on what should be the best time of the year. Plain and simple, &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; is such a hoot because we all share a bit of Clark Griswald's romantic vision of a perfect holiday. And most of us, not unlike Clark, experience a complete meltdown once the shopping begins and the relatives arrive. Around our home, we watch this movie at least 5 times every year during the Holiday Season. &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; is the perfect cure for the Holiday Blues. An absolute comedy classic!	5.0	Even Scrooge Would Love This Movie!	2000-12-01	10	9	1

Because of the nature of today's businesses, workers who had once taken perks for granted, must now realize what once was isn't anymore.  On the other hand, businesses must realize workers do expect the past to be an indicator of the future.  What is great about this movie is how it can poke fun at both sides of the issue.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2TYAL88IXRSEV	Peter Prainito	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has become a holiday tradition in my home. As many times as I've seen this movie I still laugh. There's good old cousin Eddie and his clan, the in-laws, the house covered with lights, (that don't light), an exploding turkey, and of course the squirrel. Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid play off each other perfectly. Then there's the long-suffering ever-faithful Beverly D'Angelo, who relates as Chevy's wife identically as Marge Simpson relates to Homer. The only advantage to owning this movie on DVD is the durability factor. As other reviewer's have mentioned, the DVD picture quality is poor. Besides a grainy picture, the DVD contains no extras, unless you consider a movie trailer to be a special feature. I certainly do not consider a movie trailer a big deal. There will most likely be a &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; released some day that will boast a better picture and added features; seems to be a trend with some of these DVD's.

If is funny and mostly family friendly. There are few curse words here and there, but noting unruly. It is a journey of a man and his pursuit of the perfect christmas, which well all know isn't possible. But what is does show is that the &#34;perfect&#34; Christmas is not a checklist of performed task and activities, but an ideal accomplished by spending time with family and appreciating the chaos that comes along with it.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	The third installment of the Vacation series finds the Griswold family traversing the perils of the Christmas holiday season.  This is Chevy Chase's best performance as Clark Griswold.  He perfectly mixes the goofiness of the character with a touch of sentimentality that all successful Christmas movies have.  Clark wants to have the perfect family Christmas and of course his carefully detailed plans go awry.  There are some hysterical scenes involving hanging Christmas lights on the house and shopping in a downtown Chicago department store.  The cast are all funny and the film is worth watching for Mr. Chase alone.	4.0	Chevy Shines Brightly	2012-10-24	1	0	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1IXF2UBA3EH6F	P. McDonald	I hadn't seen this movie in years and remembered it as much more funny compared to now. Then again the first time I saw it was as a young adult and about the time it was originally released. Chevy Chase was not too far removed from his SNL days (relatively) and still fairly popular. Now I guess with time I found the movie just silly and not particularly funny or entertaining. Lots of campy humor, too many close-ups of Chevy Chase's goofy wide-eyed look that became more irritating than funny, and several instances of foul language and sexual innuendo which I found uncomfortable to sit through with my 12 going on 13-year old son. There are some genuinely funny scenes, but by the end I was quite disappointed. I also suggest parents of early teen and younger kids may want to screen this PG-13 film first as the rating recommends before deciding to share it with the younger ones.	2.0	Family classic?	2012-12-02	3	0	3

What he wishes for his family, is that they have a good time.  And, what happens is one misadventure after another, all humorous.  He is able to  bring chaos with his adventures.. His wife, played by Bervely D'Angelo is loving and his children are used to him.Instead of the Griswolds going on vacation, their relatives come to visit them. What a crew,the in-laws hate each other, the crazy cousin is really crazy and has no money. The aunt and uncle have dementia and the aunt wraps the cat as a gift. Griswold covers the house with100,000 lights, and can't figure out how to turn it on. The neighbors are really going to move after this week, one thing after another occurs to them. The Griswolds try to provide a nice Christmas and all the relatives want one, but things just happen, continuously.This is a funny series, and most families seem to enjoy the absurdities of life with the Griswolds.

I then watch the DVD version and it looked faded unlike the blu-ray just watch the scene when they find a Christmas tree at the beginning of the movie the spot light on the tree from heaven is so clear and bright it like they just made the movie.Also on the DVD you see black spots from old film at times through out the movie with the blu-ray you get none of that.If this is you favorite Christmas movie like it is for me then blu-ray is a must. If you are buying for extras then you are going to be disappointed. They did get a handful of stars to talk about the movie.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI	"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan"""	"Arguably, this is the funniest of the Vacation movies. The true test of a good comedy is being able to still howl over the film years later, and ""Christmas Vacation"" more than does that for me. But this one works in reverse: Instead of the disaster-prone Griswolds travelling abroad to places like Europe or Wally World, they're anchored to the homefront as the calendar ticks off the days to Christmas. Chevy Chase is clearly in his element here reprising his role as well-intended but hopelessly klutzy matriarch Clark, who naturally, goes overboard with creating ""the perfect Christmas"". The reliably good Beverly D'Angelo is here too as Clark's supportive wife who gets her buttons pushed by annoying relatives & whining children as well as her doltish husband.The late John Hughes crams the script full of holiday satire & references, punched up with the trademark ""Lampoon"" slapstick & lowbrow humor. Granted, sometimes the humor tanks, but it's a nobler effort than the previous uneven ""European Vacation"". This one just defies you not to laugh your head off as the Griswolds' efforts to have ""the best Christmas"" turns into one long train wreck, which can tickle the funny bone of any ""Scrooge"".Look for familiar faces Juliette Lewis & Johnny Galecki (the latter currently on the hit sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory"") as the Griswold kids; a pre-Seinfeld Julia Louise-Dreyfuss as one-half of snobby yuppie neighbors suffering at the hands of Clark; and Doris Roberts, Diane Ladd & William Hickey as some of the troublesome relatives come to visit. But it's actually Randy Quaid's reprisal of goofy, freeloading hick cousin Eddie that steals every scene he's in.If you want a serious rendition of a Holiday classic, watch ""It's a Wonderful Life""; if you want to laugh hard & often, then definitely watch this one!"	5.0	The Griswolds lampoon the holidays	2009-12-02	3	3	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AHYR89427W6FS	"Raoul ""Paul"""	This will one day be a classic.  At least for me, it has made me laugh.  It has a bit of everything about the Christmas Holidays, in particular, the insanity of shopping.  Family is great and this movie shows that at this time of the year, we need to take the good with the bad (cousin Eddie).  I already had the movie but wanted to upgrade to blu-ray (the price was right) and give the other copy to my son, who happens to have the same warped sense of humor as his old man.  A fun family movie except near the end the big kahuna, the word Ralphie( A Christmas Story) escapes Clark Griswald mouth when he loses it.  Delivery was as promised.  The only negative I found is, with both copies, something was/is not right with the sound - I need to turn up my system to the top to hear.  Only DVD that I need to do that with.  Why???

It's made of styrofoam- easy to break and we threw it away. Oh, and also that on both DVD's on the back there is a shot of the Griswalds with their tree by there owner. In the movie, it dosent include that.So I will write a positive review when something SPECIAL of the movie will come out.	1.0	Un-Special Edition	2005-04-03	16	7	9

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"The Griswold family is set to celebrate the holidays like never before, in ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"" directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik and written by John Hughes.  Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) has decided to  have a traditional, old-fashioned family Christmas, and has invited his  parents and in-laws to stay with them through the season.  He has a  surprise he wants to share with everyone this year; with his Christmas  bonus from work, he's putting in a pool, to which he's already committed  the down-payment money (so the bonus had better come through, big time, or  he's ""in it up to here"").  To kick off the season, he takes Ellen (Beverly  D'Angelo) and the kids, Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki)  to the mountains to find the perfect ""Griswold family Christmas tree.  And  it's only the first of one hilarious scene after another, as we follow  Clark and clan through one long laugh-fest, filled with surprises and fun.  Chase is at his best here, in the most enduring (and endearing) character  he's ever done; Clark the Everyman, who only wants the best things for his  family and himself, but whose plans more often than not go awry, doomed to  fall just short of realization.  When he decorates the outside of the  house, he uses 25,000 twinkle lights; they use enough juice to black-out an  entire neighborhood, and they do (once he can get them to work).  Then when  cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn) show up  unexpectedly in the ""RV"" they now call home, Eddie asks Clark if he's  surprised to see him.  Surprised?  Eddie is the last person on earth Clark  expected, or wanted, to see.  ""Eddie,"" he tells him, ""I couldn't be more  surprised if I woke up tomorrow morning with my head sewn to the carpet.""  Another memorable scene involves a wild squirrel who came in with the  Christmas tree and proceeds to make his appearance during dinner, only to  provoke a wild romp upstairs and down as they all pursue (and in some cases  try to elude) the deadly invader.  A terrific cast was assembled for  this movie, but Quaid is the stand-out, and he perfects the Eddie character  in this one; forever the lamebrain with the big heart, and the one who  takes the situation in hand when Clark's bonus turns out to be an  enrollment in a jelly-of-the-month club.  Clark's parents are played by  Diane Ladd (Nora) and John Randolph (Clark, Sr.), and Ellen's by Doris  Roberts (Frances) and E.G. Marshall (Art).  Other notable performances are  turned in by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Margo) and Nicholas Guest (Todd), as  Clark's yuppie next door neighbors, and also by William Hickey (Uncle  Lewis) and Mae Questel (Aunt Bethany).  Rounding out the supporting cast  are Nicolette Scorsese (Mary), Cody Burger (Rocky), Ellen Hamilton Latzen  (Ruby Sue) and Brian Doyle-Murray (Frank Shirley).  ""National Lampoon's  Christmas Vacation"" is timeless comedy, a must for every video collection.  It can be watched over and over again, and the humor stays fresh while the  laughs get even bigger.  There's a little bit of every family in here, and  this movie may be just the tonic you'll need some day to get you through  your own ""special"" holiday season."	5.0	&quot;And To All A...Cousin Eddie?&quot;	2000-06-02	16	14	2
079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2GM9DYHD8O7UK	R. Hansen	This holiday classic just gets funnier every year. Full of classic lines & great sight gags along with one of Chevy Chase's funniest performances this has become a Christmas standard. The many hilarious scenes include Clark W.Griswold JR. stapling Christmas lights to his roof(and himself) and Clark blousing err browsing while shopping. The scene where Clark goes sledding always gets lots of laughs(it's classic Chevy Chase)! The music is good too as many Christmas favorites old & new fill the great soundtrack. This is simply a very funny Christmas comedy for those looking to laugh around the holiday season.	5.0	CHRISTMAS WITH THE GRISWOLDS	2007-08-22	2	2	0

It is an ode to your over-lit neighbors, your Scrooge-like bosses, your lovable in-laws, and all the expectations and experiences that make the Holiday Season so unpredictable &#8212; especially if you're a Griswald!  The sight gags are great, the Family rivals the Adams' in its diversity, but the outcome is what we all hope for at Christmas &#8212; Happiness!  If this movie doesn't hit home in one regard or another, then you are not married.  And after seeing this film, you may want to think about it a bit more!  This is a nicely done family film, with Chevy reliving the past while stuck in the attic, determinbed to make Christmas as unforgettable as possible.  It is required viewing; along with &#34;A Christmas Story&#34;, &#34;White Christmas&#34;, your favorite &#34;Scrooge&#34;, and &#34;A Miracle on 34th Street&#34; (both of them).  It covers all the bases, and really hits a Home Run!	5.0	"""Ode to Joy!"""	2013-12-27	0	0	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	"Saturday Night Live alumnis Chevy Chase in his 20th film released in 1989,stars in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation;the third installment in the franchises' long and still continuing history.Chase on SNL is not much different from Chase on the big screen,as he displays an alarming lack of range relying mostly on his constant mugging and less than stellar one liners.In fact he was better in his element on TV and(providentially)his career has waned into almost oblivion on the big screen since the early 90s.The film really can be pared down into about four distinctive ""plotlines"".Find a Christmas tree,insert gags,take tree home.Get out Christmas Lights,insert gags,turn on said lights.Irritating relatives arrive,insert gags,relatives are ok in the end.And finally,want raise,insert gags,finally get raise.Picture ends with a slow pull back shot of Chase looking vacantly into the night sky and proclaiming""I did it""....cue in music.Simple is the word and the mostly moronic humour is the byword throughout.Admittedly most of the Lampoon films were made with the cheap laughs in mind and nothing more.They don't pretend to be anything higher than what they are and you gets what you sees.The pacing here is also one of stops and starts.Just as it starts to get a head of steam on it it slows down for a shopping trip or a conversation with a relative.Technically the film has been remastered very well and is shown in its' original theatrical ratio.The special features,if you can call them that(especially for a so-called""special edition""),consist of the trailer and some pretty lame commentary by members of the cast(Chase not included).The DVD case itself is also very cheap...no expense spared here;no expense at all!If you are into the National Lampoon flicks,especially those with Chase then this film is up your alley.If Chase looking at a buxom girl and saying""I was just blousing,er browsing"" is your idea of comedy,that is of the very simple,low and frat house type of ""humour"" it really is,then this is for you; no doubt.For those expecting more,it warrants a big pass."	2.0	Chase mugs his way through another Vacation movie.	2009-11-14	23	4	19

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A38G64S5VMRI1P	Robert Graves	"If this film is not already a Christmas classic, it will certainly be in that group a few years down the road. Aside from the &quot;Vacation&quot; series, this movie stands on its own legs as a hilarious look into the life of Clark W. Griswold, trying to give his family the great American Christmas.There are very few slow moments in the film, which contributes to the fact that you can watch it over and over and over again, not getting sick of it (remember - a classic). It is also filled with countless memorable moments and one-liners, almost on par with &quot;Caddyshack.&quot;This film succeeds on two levels of comedy. The first is that it manages to place its characters in funny *situations* as opposed to simply having them try to speak funny lines. This is the mark of a lasting movie. The second level of success is in the humor itself (the dialogue, the one-liners, etc.). It has what it takes to be a classic.As for the special edition, it's worth it because of the commentary, which includes Randy Quaid (Eddie), Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen), Johnny Galecki (Russ), Miriam Flynn (Catherine), Director Jermemiah Chechik and Producer Matty Simmons. They get off to a rough, slow start, but if you hang in there they eventually get it going. But where's Clark? I was very surprised that Chevy Chase didn't make an appearance on the DVD anywhere, and during the commentary the others spoke about him as though he were deceased. I wonder if there was a little falling out...?The transfer to DVD is wonderful. The picture quality is great, unlike other recent releases like the special edition of ""A Christmas Story"" which contains no film restoration whatsoever.All in all, this is one that you buy. You'll throw it in again and again starting around mid-November, and it will soon become part of your Christmas tradition."	5.0	Why haven't you bought this yet?	2003-12-15	1	1	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AW3FTPCBPVQNB	Robert J. Schneider	It's amazing that Chevy Chase wasn't maimed or killed during the making of this movie. I know, there were plenty of stunt players who fell off the roof, crashed through the attic, were flung about into brick walls, etc.---but still! Chevy, who had a well-publicized stint in the Betty Ford Clinic for addiction to painkillers (due to extreme back pain caused by, of all things, his numerous falls on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the 1970's while spoofing then-President Gerald Ford---how ironic is that???), certainly took on a certain level of risk in reprising his role as the perpetually clumsy, but good-intentioned, WASP patriarch Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Jr. in this, the third installment of the VACATION series by Chase's old comedy troupe, National Lampoon.Having not seen (as of yet, believe it or not) either VACATION or EUROPEAN VACATION, I was a bit unfamiliar with the main characters; however, CHRISTMAS VACATION got me to know them real fast. I have to admit, I have not been a Chevy Chase fan since the '70's, during and immediately after his SNL days. (Let's face facts, the show made him an instant star, but he was never really one of the funniest members of the Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time Players.) However, I believe that he gives a truly inspired comedic performance in CHRISTMAS VACATION. I'm not even referring to the copious physical comedy he displays. I'm actually talking about his comedic acting! I love the manic energy with which Chase infuses his role, and the crazed look in his eye when his character is pushed over the edge. Beverly D'Angelo, as patient but frequently unamused wife Ellen, provides a good low-key foil for his over-the-top antics. She's well-cast and, I must say, beautiful.As far as acting talent goes, this film has no shortage in this department. A pre-stardom Juliette Lewis is welcome as Griswold daughter Audrey, and a very young Johnny Galecki is engaging as her kid brother Russell (three years before he was cast as Darlene's lazy boyfriend David on the hit TV show &quot;Roseanne&quot;). We also get memorable performances from E.G. Marshall, Doris Roberts, an unrecognizable Dianne Ladd, and a hysterically funny William Hickey. Rounding out the mix is Randy Quaid as filthy slob Cousin Eddie (who parks his trailer in the driveway), Nicholas Guest and Julia-Louis Dreyfus as the bland and stuck-up neighbors next door, and Brian Doyle-Murray who serves up good moments as Clark's old crabby boss.The problem with CHRISTMAS VACATION is that, while it does contain some very funny scenes with lots of great, memorable one-liners, it is marred by inferior direction on the part of first-time director Jeremiah Chechik. He tends to interlace the fast-paced physical scenes with long, slow ones that grind the movie to a dead halt every time. While I didn't expect the level of non-stop, lightning-paced zaniness a la AIRPLANE!, these extended slow breaks (that usually focus on a character staring dreamily into the sky) are awkwardly placed and paced, and thereby create an uneven viewing experience. However, John Hughes' smart and wickedly funny script pretty much saves the day. I wouldn't add this to the list of perennial must-see Christmas films (such as A CHRISTMAS STORY or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE), but CHRISTMAS VACATION does offer a lot of fun for the whole family (except for kids under the age of 10, as the language is well-seasoned with four-letter words). If it does nothing else, this film should make you feel a lot better about your Christmas!MODERATELY RECOMMENDED	3.0	The Griswold Family's Christmas From Hell	2004-04-15	4	0	4

The Blu-ray looked in parts like somebody had taken a hi-res camcorder into a movie and tried to hold it as steady as possible.  Other parts weren't as shaky, but the image quality was no better than DVD.  I'd say I'm disappointed, but my expectations weren't Avatar-level graphics.

Now, this many years later, in speaking with my sister about some ""relatives"" that she was having some concerns over, I snidely commented that her story reminded me of the Chevy Chase Movie, Christmas Vacation.  She either didn't remember this movie or actually had never seen it before so I immediately went to Amazon.com (which always has the best prices)and ordered one for her.It arrived within a few days and the next phone call I received was the sound of my sister laughing hysterically as she thanked me for the great gift.

This is Chevy at his best and a great story. There are times when Randy Quaid almost steals the show.One of the things that makes Chevy / Clark so endearing is his innocence.

The one thing I would change would be the scene where the girl from the store, Mary, dives into Clark's imaginary pool.

Maybe I watched the TV edited version or something like that cause I didn't remember half the stuff in this movie. Yes it's very funny, but you ought to watch it first before you decide if you'd like your kids to. There's a lot of language and content that not so great for kids. By today's ratings I think this would be an R based on the language alone.	2.0	Was not the family movie that I thought it was	2012-12-19	3	2	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1VZAEQZ4IA48A	S. Brown	Every year our family watches an old VCR tape of this movie for Christmas.  So decided that this year I'd update it with a new DVD.  Unfortunately, the sound was out of sinc with the movement of the lips.  Kind of like one of the old Saturday Night Live skits they did about the old Roman warrior movies.  Amazon made good and sent a new one.  Unfortunately, this new one did the same thing.  When I talked to a representative from Amazon they said they would pull the stock from the shelves and review the other ones to see whether they had gotten a bad batch.  Their advice was to wait a couple of weeks before trying again.  I'm thinking I'll get it somewhere else.	1.0	Bad Crop of DVD's for this movie	2010-01-17	8	2	6
079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A17B5QYQXKTNR	scarlet	Some of the scenes from this movie have become traditional laughs for my family.  Love the Yuppie couple next door that are too &#34;sophisticated&#34; for Christmas, and I love the overall theme of the movie that Christmas is for going all-out for your family.  There are all the favorite characters from the &#34;Vacation&#34; movie - cousin Eddie and his family; the sexy blond model; plus some new characters - the inlaws.  If you haven't seen the movie be warned that there's a cat that gets electrocuted by chewing on Christmas lights, but it's done in a funny way, but some cat-lovers may not like it.  Anyway, I'm a cat lover and it doesn't really bother me because the whole movie is done in a positive way, looking at all the craziness and disasters that can happen at Christmas, including having to put up with visiting in-laws, and there's going to be something in this movie that makes you say - &#34;that happened to us one year!&#34;  For us, it was the overcooked turkey - we had one almost as bad as the Griswold's turkey!  The Griswold kids are actually very loving and supportive of their parents while still being typical kids, bored one minute and excited the next, and Ellen is great as usual.  The last scenes about the &#34;kidnapping&#34; of Clark's boss are absolutely hysterical and the best part, in my opinion.  Good movie.	5.0	Christmas laughs	2012-11-24	0	0	0

You'll love it!The version I have has a special feature where you can watch the original version, or a version that has commentary from the actors during the movie, which is also hilarious!*Of course this is a full blown comedy mind you, so if you're looking for that ""It's a wonderful life"" message, stick with It's a Wonderful Life.

Finally it arrives! But wait, what's this??It's a &quot;Matted Widescreen&quot;. What's a &quot;Matted&quot; Widescreen?Why that's the pan-and-scan version with the top and bottomscut off. So instead of losing 30% of the movie's scenes watchingthe pan-and-scan version, you can now lose more than 50% ofthe movie!!

This movie is a Christmas comedy classic. Anyone who is a fan of Saturday Night Live will find this movie hilarious. Chevy Chase is brilliant. If the Holliday's get you down, then watch this movie.

Chevy Chase returns as Clark Griswald and gives his funniest performance yet.  Beverly D'Angelo is also back as Ellen, and not to mention Randy Quaid has also returned to play good old Uncle Eddy.  This movie will have you laughing the whole time.  The DVD could have a better selection of extra's but trust me, the movie is satisfying enough.What makes this movie different from the rest of the Vacation movies is the fact that the Griswalds don't actually take a vacation.  Instead they stay home and invite the in-laws to join them for the holidays.  One of the greatest moments in the movie would have to be when Eddy kidnaps Clark's boss to fufill Clark's Christmas wish.Forget &quot;The Santa Clause&quot;, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, and &quot;A Miracle on 34th Street&quot;.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A26G3P11S7S61T	"""showbiz919"""	"This is by far the best Christmas movie of all time.  What makes it even better for me is I only view this movie once a year on Christmas Eve.  Now it is hard to do, but it makes it about fifty times better.  The movie stars Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold, a father and husband who wants the best for his family but always manages to lure disasters upon them, not to mention himself.Even from the opening scene in the film, Clark nearly creates an early death for the family.  Beverly D' Angelo returns as Clark's uptight wife Hellen.  Now one thing that you should know about Clark is that he always gives 110% with everything he does.  His Christmas tree is about 15 feet tall, and his Christmas lights cause an energy loss throughout the entire city of Chicago.Unlike the other Vacation films, the Griswolds stay home for Christmas and invite just about every relative they have to celebrate the holiday with them.  Even the ones they don't invite show up.  This would be none other than Clark's budweiser-filled Uncle Eddie along with his wife Katherine and two children.  Not to mention a doberman pincher that won't stop destroying the house.""Christmas Vacation"" is a movie that will be sure to attract laughs and will have you wishing it were Christmas everyday of the year!"	5.0	The Greatest Christmas Movie of All Time!	2002-12-22	3	2	1

What intrigued me more was the fact that this film,  like ""Joon"",  wasn't my kind of film.  The direction was fabulous.  The writing is insanely good.  All roads in this film lead to fun.  The cinematography doesn't take from the comedic skill in this film.  I adore E.G. Marshall,  his comedic/horror acting was/is grand in ""Creepshow"".  You'll also love the teaming of Diane Ladd and Doris Roberts.  Although they don't interact much, they feed off of each other to a great effect.  Chevy Chase is a comedic lovers dream.  Even Beverly D'Angelo is cast well here to compliment Chase.  The irritating and grotesque Randy Quaid is likeable,  yet leavable.  This film has it all for the funny lover.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AGRR05FH945HR	Steven Cain	Mary being the lingerie saleswoman dressed in red... In the Lampoon tradition of Christie Brinkley, the divine Nicolette Scorsese provided Chevy's Fantasy Babe interest in this excellent movie. The scene in which Randy Quaid's beer swilling Cousin Eddie transitions into Nicolette, standing on a diving board and teasing Clark, as she peels off a hot red swimsuit is just one of a thousand laughs in this utter classic.With a cast like this you can't really go wrong, and Brian Doyle Murray (Bill Murray's older brother) plays his Scrooge role flawlessly.Hard to pick out my favorite crazy scene, although the sequence in which Clark goes on an unwitting death ride in a super slippy saucer sled (hey, how about that alliteration?) is certainly a major thigh slapper.The Special Features are rather limited, and for some reason Chevy is absent from the track Commentary, which is entertainingly handled by Bev and Randy etc.Definitely a classic.	5.0	Mary Christmas	2006-01-01	2	2	0

The memorable one-liners that you find yourself repeating are still funny today.The commentary reel was great, although I noticed once you turned it on, you couldn't turn it off until you ejected the DVD.  This is likely just a programming error, and not exactly end-of-the-world stuff.  Like others, I think it would have been much better had Mr. Chase decided to sign on and provide his take on the movie; nevertheless, the cast that did show up did an admirable job setting up the scenes and giving some juicy ""you wouldn't believe this but..."" background stories.The DVD itself looks good on my hi-def widescreen, although this is another film that could benefit from some TLC in the restoration department.Overall, you can't go wrong with this purchase if you enjoy holiday hijinks and laugh-a-minute one-liners that the Vacation series brings."	5.0	Still pretty ho-ho-hilareous!	2007-07-21	4	3	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1G7YSG5MOEOXE	TD	I try to watch this movie every year around Christmas time.  It's full of family humor and enough off-color material to satisfy.  The off color material is cloaked in adult nuance, so the kids can see this mostly.  The Eddie character is hilarious.  This is one of those movies you see more each time you watch it.  I give it a &#34;B&#34; but it's a strong B and doesn't get old quickly.  While third in the franchise, it recovers nicely from the missed opportunity of European Vacation.  The first one was almost a new genre, but is a little bit old these days being from the 1980s.  They are all still funny.  There was a final one that may or may not have been put out by the same people called Eddie's Island or something close - avoid that one.	4.0	Perenial Favorite	2013-12-17	0	0	0

It's Chevy Chase at his best as an uptight yuppie trying to carve out the best Christmas he can for his family.  What lies in the way, though, is the family.  Both sets of in-laws descend upon the house to the delight of no one.  Followed by lovely, lovely old Aunt Bethany with her dementia shows up with a live Christmas present.  And! no holiday would be complete without that deadbeat relative that shows up for the free food.  Cousin Eddy adds to the hilarity that is probably one of the worst family gatherings of all time.If you haven't seen this movie, crawl out from under your rock and do so!	5.0	Review Needed?	2011-08-02	2	2	0

This movie definitly lives up to the quality of Vacation as it is completely hysterical! There are so many memorable lines in this movie youll be reciting them casually to friends and family. You gotta feel bad for Clark, why cant he ever have little fun with his family. The movie pinpoints just how stereotypical Christmas can be, and then shows how it can be if everything goes wrong. Great cast and Chevy Chase leads the group in a wonderful movie thatll have you rolling out of your seat.

That copy is the copy that I have watched every year (yes I still have VHS). But I saw this year that this was out on Blu-ray so I wanted to get it because it was time to replace the VHS copy. This copy of the movie doesn't look any better than my on VHS which when you think about it is terrible. Anyone who has bought a vintage film on Blu-ray with the remaster done from the original film knows how amazing they can look. This looks like the Blu-ray was made right from the VHS copy! If you see a copy of it you will see right in the very first shot on the title screen that the stutters (jsut a little) just like old VHS tapes did. If you want the movie because you don't have it then you have no choice but if you already have a decent copy don't waste your money.	4.0	Great movie - terrible transfer	2011-12-30	3	2	1

Chevy Chase and Beverly D'angelo reprise their rolls as the Griswolds in this third ""vacation movie.  Also back is Randy Quaid as hick cousin Eddie.Clark Griswold just wants to give his family a great old fashioned Christmas but typically goes over the top on everything.  This movie demonstrates all the bad things about Christmas...dealing with family, shopping, decorating, etc...It all makes for one funny, but even a bit touching knowing how much Clark loves his family and does give them that great Christmas in the end.EVerything works here.  Great character actors including E.G. marshall, and Diane ladd in roles as two of the Griswolds parents.The Special edition is nothing to write home about.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	"I've long been a fan of the ""Vacation"" films, as well as National Lampoon movies in general.  ""Christmas Vacation"" is the third-best Lampoon movie and the second-best of the ""Vacation"" series.  Chevy Chase returns as Clark Griswold Jr., who is this time set on making this year's Christmas one to remember.  He did it.Chase is at best and funniest.  Beverly D'Angelo returns as Ellen Griswold, with the Griswold kids now portrayed by Johnny Galecki and a young Juliette Lewis.  Diane Ladd, John Randolph, E.G. Marshall, and Doris Roberts are the grandparents.  Randy Quaid is hilarious in his return as Cousin Eddy.  Brian Doyle-Murray is, as always, great, as Clark's angry, cold-hearted boss.  Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis-Dreyfus play Clark's rich, stuck-up neighbors.The soundtrack is actually very good.  It's filled with some great Christmas tunes, along with a good score by the amazing Angelo Badalamenti.John Hughes' script is terrific.  We can believe what the Griswold family is going through because we've gone through it too.  But Hughes' script isn't all laugh-out-loud comedy; at it's heart, it's a message about a caring father who tries to make the best Christmas for his family.  There's one scene where Clark can't get the Christmas lights to work, and all the family members say comforting things to him; I thought it was actually a pretty moving scene.""Christmas Vacation"" is great, hilarious Christmas fun.  If you're looking for a new movie this Christmas season, give this one a shot."	4.0	"The third-best Lampoon movie and the second-best ""Vacation"" film"	2005-11-26	0	0	0

We love this movie and watch it over and over during the Christmas season.  As a matter of fact my wife and I swear that our Christmas this year mirrored Griswolds.  We cut down our tree from the same location that we have for the last few years and for some reason the week before Christmas you could not even breathe on it without it loosing needles, so we had to go out and get a new tree, the hooter/hotter happened and we both just started laughing, the list could go on and on but at least we enjoyed our Christmas together watching this movie about 7 different times.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A1CAA94EOP0J2S	Travis J Smith	I bet your Christmas plans never quite work out right. The Griswalds'plans never work out either. Clark wants an old-fashioned familyChristmas. Somewhere between Cousin Eddie showing up and the treecatching fire, everything goes wrong. The Griswalds are just as funnyas they are in the other National Lampoon vacation movies (skip VegasVacation). The best character of all has to be Randy Quaid's 'Cousin Eddie'.He and Chevy Chase are at their best in this movie. This movie ishilarious from start to finish.This is one of the funniest Christmas movies ever made; actually, it'sprobably one of the funniest movies ever made, period. I watch it atleast once or twice a year, and so does everyone else in my family.Christmas isn't Christmas at my house if nobody quotes Clark or Eddieat least once. Everyone has at least one favorite line. If you'restarting your collection of Christmas movies, make this one of yourfirst buys.	5.0	The Quotable Griswalds	2002-10-23	0	0	0

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AXYUXJEC25ZQE	Trevor Thurlow (Ontario, Canada)	"Ever since it came out in  the late-1980's, ""Christmas Vacation"" has been an annual viewing tradition for millions of people. The movie is up there with ""Miracle On 34th Street"", ""It's A Wonderful Life"", the Santa Clause Trilogy and ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" (although on the language front, Vacation is nowhere as clean as those other classics).Unfortunately, Warner's has not done a good job with the Blu-Ray.  I also own the film on DVD, so I'm able to compare the two, and I would have to say that the DVD provides your best bang for your buck.  On my 40"" 1080p TV the upressed DVD looks equal to the Blu-Ray (the Blu-Ray has a bit that, for the most part, is right around the 10.0 to 15.0Mbps, with the occasional section between 20.0 and 25.0Mbps).  Warner's did not put any effort into this Blu-Ray.  I've never seen this movie on VHS, but others have told me that when they compared the VHS and DVD versions, they didn't find any real difference in terms of the master used.  So it could be possible that this is a transfer that was made in the 1980's and was intended for airing on the old analog MUSE HDTV system that was in use in some parts of the world in the  1980's and 1990's.Audio wise, again the Blu-Ray features the DVD's same Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround track at a whopping 192kbps.  The special features are also the same: theatrical trailer and cast audio commentary.If you are looking for a copy of this video, just get the Standard Definition DVD version and just allow your DVD/Blu-Ray player to upconvert the video to High Definition."	1.0	Christmas Classic Gets Poor Blu-Ray Transfer	2013-11-16	7	7	0

The Blu Ray upgrade in picture quality is worth it.But, skip the Ultimate Collector's Edition and just stick with the single disk purchase. The extra items such as the coasters, the fake snow, the santa hat and the moose cup are all low quality crap. The Marty Moose mug, which could have been THE item to have in this set is so small you could barely stick your pinky finger in the opening. the tin package for the set is nice but only takes up space on the shelf unless you can find another holiday use for it.	4.0	A+ Xmas Classic but don't pay for the extras	2009-12-06	4	3	1

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A9PKYI8B9V9VB	"V. Vanderbent ""always curious"""	"This is one of the strangest comedies I have ever wasted my time on. Chevy Chase is a great comedian when he's given the chance. This script by John Hughes was either manipulated by a dozen or so movie execs or he just lost it. What's missing you might ask? Let's start with continuity. We're just limping along from one supposedly funny situation to another. But unless you never saw comedy before, you've all seen it - there's nothing really new that 'Christmas Holiday' puts on the table - not even the (according to the cover) ""exploding turkey"" (it actually implodes, but who thought that viewers might not notice the difference?). Second, they actually waste footage by repeating jokes. Yes, they extend the ""turning on the xmas lights"" situation twice. Give me a break!The main problem is that the viewer is expected to have watched the previous National Lampoon movies with Chevy and his gang so as to be familiar with all the inside jokes. Guess what, I haven't, and that's (partially) why this movie falls so hard and so flat on its face as a comedy. Is it then a drama perhaps? A little supposed kidnapping, a SWAT team on the front yard, a feisty squirrel being chased by a dog through the house (probably the only funny scene in the whole movie - though it's been done before, so again nothing new here). You be the judge if you really have nothing better to do on that lazy Sunday afternoon.There are a few tender moments, such as when Chevy talks about christmas to his young niece in the kitchen. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Look for something like ""Elf"" instead, a thousand times better than this."	2.0	Two stars for tender moments	2006-01-15	15	0	15

The movie is f'in hillarious, my mom will tell you that it's the best of the whole VACATION series, well if it isn't it certainly is a close two. Packed to the rim with hillarious one liners all around, this movie is always a blast. Hell, I even know a family that doesn't celebrate Christmas, and THEY watch this one every year.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A254Z4O7ORVL6U	wellwellwell	"In my opinion, `National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' is in fact the best of the four Vacation movies.  The slapstick usage is hilarious; and a certain step up from the original and 'NL's European Vacation'.  The Griswolds are a fun-loving, ill-fated bunch that deliver the laughs like no other [movie] family out there.  This is certainly one that the whole family can enjoy; year after year after year for that matter.  `Christmas Vacation' is no doubt a timeless classic.  And in the third of four Vacation flicks, they deliver with greater triumph.  Even so, I did find a few weak things within the film's success.This is one of the funniest, and best, Christmas comedy movies available; though (in my opinion) not one of Chevy Chase's best performances.  I think he is so much better in both `Fletch' and `Fletch Lives'.  As he does in all the vacation movies, Chase (as Clark Griswold) seems to not be phased at all by the endless bad things that happen to him and his family.  It's hard to believe they wouldn't give up; but I guess that's what makes them the Griswolds in the first place.  Anyway, Chevy Chase is not a ""humbug"" kind-of guy.  On another low point, the family doesn't really go on a true ""vacation"".  I have a hard time understanding how National Lampoon can call this a Vacation movie if they never actually leave town.  Maybe they wanted to give us a look into the home lives of the Griswolds; or something to that effect.  It seemed to work, yet it's not quite what you'll be used to.  Also, the character of Audrey Griswold was replaced (formerly Dana Hill) with Juliette Lewis.  The same goes for the role of Russell.  Jason Lively was replaced by child star Johnny Galecki.  Neither of the replacements are half as good as the originals; the director must`ve been looking for more of a fan-base.  On a more optimistic note, the appearances by infamous funnyman Randy Quaid and Seinfeid co-star Julia Louis-Dreyfus are very pleasant.  Maybe not Quaid's character so much; his irritable, unemployed character is rather, well... quaint.  But, as Clark's angered neighbors, Julia and Nicolas Guest offer some comical relief from the Griswold's continual faults.  The troubles Clark and co. have seem to turn on their neighbors.  That worked well for the movie, I think.As I've mentioned, I think this is the best Vacation film.  But that is a very arguable statement.  There are a lot of differences; some good, some bad, that make this one rather special.  However, a fact is that whether at Christmas time or not, you'll enjoy it.  There's parts that we can easily relate to (example: competing with neighbors to see who has the most/best Xmas lights), whereas there's things we couldn't even imagine (example: putting a 25-foot tree in the house).  Whatever the relevance between you and the movie; it makes no difference in the end.  I gave this only 3 stars because I am not a huge fan of the Vacation films; and I don't feel they (this one) showcase the spot-on talents of Chevy Chase as good as the `Fletch' movies do.  Still, enjoy `National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' over and over again.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on one of the best Christmas movies around; and the best of the Vacation series."	3.0	The best of the Vacation series? Probably	2003-03-31	4	1	3

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5	W. freeman	"I've loved this movie since i first saw it when i was around 14 or so in 1989, since then every single Christmas its on about 300 times on different channels. Chevy Chase was at his peak then slowly disappeared, while Eddy (Randy Quaid) stole the show and went on to do much bigger things. I wish they would not even have done Vegas Vacation being that it was the least funny and just down right stupid at times. This is the ultimate Christmas movie for every family to enjoy, but does it need to be on Blu Ray? No. I went to a friends house who had some movies, most of which i had already seen on blu ray, so i thought to myself well i'm in a laughing mood so why not watch this on Blu Ray. Even his nice 55 inch LED Samsung the picture just looked, well, normal, and fuzzy as well. I never really did understand why they would put movies like this in HD anyways, TV is fine, but a disc no. Most people don't care to see movies like The Notebook, Hangover, Grown Ups, 50 First Dates and those sorts of movies because its just unnecessary. I've never watched a normal film and thought wow, look at the sweat on there faces, look how vibrant their clothes look, how real that conversation looks!! Blu Ray should be put aside for action, horror, nature films or sci fi, most everything else is pretty pointless. Oh well, the movie is great and the funniest of all the franchise, my next would be European Vacation, then the original. Don't waste money though when you can just turn it on this Christmas and catch it 20 times a day before hand. I was just in the mood to watch it, but was not impressed with the quality at all.

079070546X	National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	Despite being a fan of National Lampoon's &#34;Vacation&#34; and &#34;European Vacation&#34; movies, for whatever reason I had not sat down and watched this Christmas edition of the series.  I had expectations for high humor coming into the viewing, but was left with the bad taste of a series starting to turn stale.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase), wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), and kids Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki) hosting &#34;the relatives&#34; for Christmas.  This obviously includes Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and Co. as well.  Per the typical formula, everything goes to hell-in-a-hand-basket despite the best intents of Clark.While the first two Vacation-series movies seem fresh and genuinely funny, &#34;Christmas Vacation&#34; seems stale and overbearing (like all the comedy jokes/situations are &#34;reaches&#34;).  Sure, there are some legitimately laugh-out-loud moments in the film, but mostly it falls pretty flat.The main reason for the disappointing effort here is the casting changes.  Lewis and Galecki, while both proved afterwards to be pretty fair actors in their own right, are terrible for the roles of Audrey/Rusty (key characters that provide so much of the humor in the earlier films).  Maybe it was just the fact that the &#34;original&#34; Russ/Audrey can never quite be topped.Thus, while I was hoping for great things from this experience, I can say now that I won't be watching it next Xmas season (or maybe any further out, either).  It just fails to capture that quirky sense of humor that its predecessors nailed so succinctly.	2.0	The Griswolds Start To Stale	2013-11-29	2	0	2

Just thinking about this film makes me begin to shake with uncontrollable laughter. This film defines silly, and it does so in such unexpected ways that even the most taciturn among you will break into uproarious fits of child-like giggling.	5.0	Christmas Madness	2007-12-11	0	0	0
