B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"There is a sweep and grandeur to ""Pride and Prejudice,"" which gives the movie an instant appeal.  Based on the Jane Austin classic, the scenes move forward at a brisk pace to keep our interest, but it is the portrayals that make the movie continually engaging.The Bennet family is of small means.  The father, and, particularly, the mother, are interested in seeking suitors for each of their five daughters.  Focus is primarily on Elizabeth (Keira Knightly), or ""Lizzie,"" the protagonist, who is treated like the ugly duckling of the five.  She is captivating for her wit and intelligence. We immediately have an affinity to her, for she never suffers fools gladly, and she has the brazenness to confront those of higher standing who may belittle her.  So, the situation is ripe when an aristocrat, Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyed) and his friend, Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), pay a visit to the household.  After some social invitations and gatherings, Mr. Bingley takes a fancy to Jane, her favored elder sister, but it provides opportunities for Lizzie to mingle with the seemingly cold and aloof, Mr. Darcy.  There are many instances when the two meet and work out their desires and distastes for one another.  He regards her as saucy; she finds  him to be arrogant.  Many partial disclosures of his past help to make a portrait of him that she increasingly detests.  There is a diversion when a guest suitor, Mr. Collins, a respectable and scrupulous moral figure, visits the household and forces his affections upon her.  There is also a key crisis when the youngest daughter is taken by a suitor in a situation that may be described as compromising.  Once affections are fully realized, Lizzie is confronted by Mr. Darcy's aunt, the indomitable Lady Catherine de Bourg (Judi[th] Dench).The new production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" has many merits.  The scenes unfold with a grace and movement that is instantly appealing.  Especially the dancing and mingling scenes are choreographed with finesse.  Similar British movies with great acclaim are sometimes tedious affairs, but this one is winning.  The characters, including the nervous mother, the affectionate father, and the likable Mr. Bingley, are exemplary draws.  The portrayals, especially by Knightly, MacFadyed, and Dench are enthralling.  The novel, which I confess I've never read, is probably followed closely--it would be hard to imagine otherwise--but I don't wish to put up pretenses or consult other reviews.  However, it is easy to appreciate the skillfulness that Austin uses through her mouthpiece, Elizabeth, to confront the attitudes and mores of the upper classes.  Maintaining her charm and dignity, she is able to answer to the impossible standards suitors make upon their chosen mistresses for courtship.  Like ""Lady Chatterly's Lover"" and ""Jude, the Obscure,"" which I have read, ""Pride and Prejudice"" overthrows the mores and conventions of aristocratic arrogance with style and skill.  The movie captures the spirit well."	5.0	To Be Savoured	2006-06-04	10	5	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A120NC1SO8HM7X	"A. Amis ""the coquis that reads"""	Alright, so where do I begin?  Well, overall I thought this was a great movie which followed along with Austen's story quite well (in light of the time constraints which movies must adhere to).  I loved all the characters- each was true to the nature that Austen intended them for.  I thought the chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy was great, just enough romance but not too overpowering.  Clearly the people that made this movie read the story.  I only wish that the story continued on, alas Austen never wrote the sequel so I am kinda glad a second movie hasn't been made (it just wouldn't be the same).  I only gave this four stars because something was wanting, I just can't put my hand on what (possibly the ending scene- could have been better).  Anyhow, if you loved the book let me assure you, you'll like the movie, if not love it (I watched in three times the day it came out)!	4.0	lovable	2006-03-07	9	6	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1OP06TJKSCLLI	"A Book Lover ""Carol"""	"This adaptation seems more like Emily Bronte than Jane Austen but it's one of the few films which have motivated me to go to a movie theater this year. I was surprised at how well Keira Knightley interpreted Elizabeth Bennett and though Matthew MacFadyen isn't as perfect as Colin Firth was as Fitzwilliam Darcy, this may just be ""prejudice"" on my part. Even my Anglophobe husband enjoyed this film but I think that it may be because of lovely Rosamund Pike who plays Jane Bennett. Donald Sutherland is a nice surprise as Mr. Bennett and Dame Judy Dench is magnificent as always in her role as Lady Catherine De Bourg. Go see it if only for the scenery and the feel of the Regency period. You won't be sorry."	5.0	Not Entirely True to the Book but Entrancing None the Less	2005-12-02	6	4	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3N0X0HS0S6FPG	Acadia93	"While this is a decent version of the movie and I did buy a copy; it is really like owning the ""Cliff Notes"" version for evenings when I don't have time to see the whole spectacular movie that was by A&E; starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Erhle. The characters in this version, directed by Joe Wright are not well developed, you do not have a chance to fall in love and understand them. The portrayl and development of the rest of the Bennet family, aside from Elizabeth, is rushed and mediocre.  Elizabeth herself swings in her moods from giggly girl to proud woman; yet no constancy of character.  Mr Darcy (Macfadyen) is a saving grace in this film. His facial expressions and delivery save his character and he does the part justice.  You just wish for more scenes with Mr. Darcy.Overall, I like the movie for a dose of Pride & Prejudice on a night when I don't have time for the ""real thing"". But for those of you who really love the book and love this genre of film...treat yourself to the A&E;/BBC version.  You will not be disappointed."	3.0	Doesn't measure up to the A&E/BBC Version	2006-06-02	10	6	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2GDEPPC8BAZRY	"A. Casalino ""V^^^^^V"""	"Once again, I have had the pleasure of finding one of Jane Austen's classic novels brought to the big screen -- and once more I couldn't fancy myself happier.  Ah- would that there were hundreds of such renderings!Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is amongst all in the whole vast world of literature the dearest to my heart.  Therefore, even a version that deigns tamper with a decade-old perfection serves to excite my interest.  Indeed- for I was simply ecstatic when, in 1995, A&E; and the BBC collaborated to create a grand and brilliantly performed portrayal of that book.  At a length of nearly 6 hours, no aspect of this wonderful story had been neglected - and I knew that such a true commitment to the literature, combined with such passion for the tale, is a precious rarity in film. Now, years hence, that 1995 picture still resonates.  Comparisons are to be inevitable, no doubt.  I'd already been well reconciled to the fact that a two-hour version of the story, no matter how well done, could only suffer in the comparison to that A&E; production.  I therefore resolved to judge this movie by its own qualities -- And what fine qualities they turned out being!  Brilliantly directed by Joe Wright, this sensual and earthy interpretation just warms my soul.Keira Knightley takes on the role of our heroine: Elizabeth Bennet, the 2nd oldest of the five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet (Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn).  Matthew MacFadyen plays our hero: Mr. Darcy, the handsome and aloof owner of a great estate in the north of England.  The two go down the dance, waltzing through misunderstanding and mischance - wit and romance, dexterously stepping along fine lines of social propriety and distinction of class, through rejection and redemption, conjuring the many diversions of country life in Regency England. Yes, we Janeites all know the story.The casting herein is essentially very agreeable.  Knightly is lovely and makes for a fine Elizabeth, and the camera adores her- though when Darcy finds her appearance only ""tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me,"" it strikes one as rather unbelievable.  She effortlessly captures Lizzy's wry spirit and spark of humor, though I must admit I found her a little bit wanting in that quiet depth or the brilliance of mind that role calls for.MacFadyen's take on Darcy is more dark and brooding than actors in the past have portrayed him.  And though I enjoyed watching him, I cannot say that he did very well in expressing the changes Mr. Darcy undergoes:  I did not see an aristocrat stuffed with pride, whose passion for Elizabeth blossoms as he becomes transformed by her spirited influence.  Rather, he just seems to convey the same brooding manner all along - and his only problem appears to be that he is misunderstood.As for the supporting players, I think Sutherland was excellent as the bemused Mr. Bennet - and his scene with Lizzy at the end was exquisitely drawn.  Blethyn played her part very well, too - her Mrs. Bennet was every bit as laughable and endearing as Austen wrote her.  Judi Dench was wonderfully formidable as Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  The roles of Mr. Collins, Jane Bennet, Mr. Bingley and Wickham were also excellently played.Visually, this film is just stunning.  I've rarely, if ever, seen more exquisite scenery in a movie. The camera work is mesmerizing.  The cinematography here is certainly Oscar-worthy.  I can even forgive the overly rusticated state (complete with chickens, pigs, & all manner of livestock traipsing throughout the house) of Longbourn, the Bennet family home.  This, in fact, only serves to give charm to this beautiful and totally unique rendition of a most beloved story."	5.0	Picturesque and Pleasing	2005-12-03	22	18	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2EEUQ81DTY7G3	A Customer	"In this latest version of Pride and Prejudice, Director Joe Wright uses impressive visuals and sumptuous period locales to create an exquisite wide-screen spectacle, filling it with details that illustrate important sociological information about its central family, the Bennets. From the movie's mist-filled and dream-like opening moments to its marvelous ball sequence and the predictable but nonetheless glorious ending, Pride & Prejudice is an absolutely sumptuous evocation of Jane Austen's milieu, and is a captivatingly youthful spin without compromising the novel's late-eighteenth-century manners; it also deserves to be remembered as one of the very best screen adaptations of this book so far.Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) is fraught with worry. The mother of five daughters has proved to be a little bit much for her and if they don't start marrying soon, the family will be ruined. The father (Donald Sutherland) stays out of the way, hoping his daughters somehow overcome societal prejudice against their gender and make something of their minds.  Headstrong Elizabeth (Kira Knightley) has done just that. Smart, feisty, and fiercely independent, Lizzie promises herself that she won't be one to settle.When Lizzie's older sister, Jane (Rosamund Pike), meets the wealthy Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) at a dance, their future as a couple seems predetermined. But when Lizzie is introduced to the gloomy and standoffish Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), an instant dislike is established. Lizzie and Mr. Darcy must overcome quite a few obstacles before they can transcend their dislike of each other, not the least of which is unsuitable suitor Mr. Collins (a wonderfully comic Tom Hollander) and Darcy's formidable aunt Lady Catherine (Dame Judi Dench) who tells Lizzie that she is of an ""inferior class."" Of course, Lizzie's frosty rejection of Darcy eventually thaws when he confesses his passion for her one evening on a misty moor.Pride and Prejudice really works because of the marvelously impassioned performances from its two sexy leads. As the strong-willed Elizabeth, Knightley is tantalizing and seductive, so perfectly fitting into her 19th century Austen surroundings; she catches Elizabeth's essential skittishness and youthful braggadocio, making her final conversion with Darcy all the more moving. Macfadyen as Darcy is a more conflicted, softer figure than Colin Firth's indelibly etched performance, but Macfadyen is much earthier and sexier, and his portrayal is one that fits the movie's more realistic mood.Pride and Prejudice benefits from Wright's intensely visual approach that manages to meld realism with romance in a canny balance. The movie has a youthful essence, as well as providing a richly detailed setting. Scenes barely sketched in Austen's dialogue-heavy, description-light prose leap fully detailed onto the screen, thanks to Sarah Greenwood's terrific production design and Jacqueline Durran's textured costumes. This is a unique, gorgeously evocative, and quite accomplished film, which should satisfy even the most rabid Austen-ophiles - just lovely.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A359WSYHUDZUGY	"A ""Customer too"""	My daughter and I were very much disappointed with this movie.  We might have been more impressed had we not seen Colin Firth's and Jennifer Ehle's version of Pride and Prejudice first.  The movie seemed rushed. Sometimes the characters spoke far too fast so you had no clue as to what they were saying. Some of the essential characters were cut from the story. Mr. Bingley was a real goofball. The only noteworthy enhancements  from the Firth & Ehle version were Jane and Mr. Wickham characters. This is not a slight against Keira Knightley because she is as beautiful as I would expect Elizabeth Bennett to be.  However, Jennifer Ehle was perfection as Elizabeth Bennett, and Colin Firth is the sexiest.  Had I seen this movie before I purchased it, I would have saved my money.  I'm not saying that the acting was terrible because the actors worked very will with what they had.  However, some things are better left alone and not attempted.  That is, the mold was absolutely broken after Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle version of Pride and Prejudice was made.	2.0	The mold was absolutely broken after Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle!	2008-06-14	12	6	6
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1K22RZE4T2KWO	Adamski	I can't believe how badly this movie got Jane Austen's seminal work. The plot is so thin, and the whole point of the book, the mutual transformation of both Lizzy and Darcy, which is the only thing that allows them to be so happy is all but missing. If you don't have time for all the plot then cut the whole Wickham and Lydia side plot out so you can do justice to at least one part of this story. UGH.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3LVL18L95JETF	Agnes Vanderveen	Pride and Prejudice is a great movie! Both Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen give great performances. Rosamund Pike as the elder sister, Jane, is a delight. Simon Woods as Bingley is wrongly portrayed as rather foolish, but he is absolutely cute and adorable about Jane, so it's all good. Claudie Blakely (Charlotte Lucas/Collins) gives a much more sympathetic performance than any other Charlotte before her. The friendship between Lizzy and Charlotte feels totally right and believable.I feel it is my duty to warn you that the ending scenes are very close to horrendous, at least to Janeites. The dialogue is cheesy, and the second proposal is in the early morning, with both Lizzy and Darcy in their nightclothes. Darcy especially made me cringe. When the movie all of a sudden jumps from Mr. Bennet's consent to Pemberley, you have to cringe again. And then grit your teeth when Darcy and Lizzy are again in their nightclothes, and saying lines that are so syrupy you want to laugh, but have to cry b/c it's P+P that this crew is messing up.There are many things wrong with the movie, but I love a lot of things in it too. For instance, when Lizzy sees Darcy at Rosings. The scene when Bingley and Darcy practice Bingley's proposal to Jane. The scene when, in church, Fitzwilliam tells Lizzy about Darcy's separation of Bingley and Jane.A must for die-hard Janeites, just ignore the ending.	4.0	Loved it, but BEWARE of cheesy ending!!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3PYISV654M0W4	A	"Joe Wright did a stunning job with this magnificent version of Pride & Prejudice. Keira Knightley shines as Elizabeth Bennet, and the supporting cast, including Donald Sutherland as the kind, softspoken Mr. Bennet, Jena Malone as the silly Lydia, and stunning Rosamund Pike as Jane, is delightful as well; but it is the gorgeous Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy who truly captures. There's not a slow moment in this film; it is steady, enchanting, and worth a thousand views.The enchanting melodies used for this film's score did much to enhance the tone of the film; the piano solo Dawn is exceptionally haunting, as is Liz On Top of the World. It's inspiring me to sit myself down on a piano again, although I'm sure I would ruin the music rather than do justice to it.Filmed almost entirely on location, the only set built for the production was the ballroom in which Darcy and Lizzie first meet. The use of Chatsworth House, Wilton House, and Basildon Park, as well as other grand, stately homes, provided a beautiful setting for this extraordinary adaptation.SPOILER/ENDING ALERT:  Here's an interesting bit: my favorite part of the movie - the ending - features Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy outside, enjoying a moment together under starlight, sharing one of my favorite film conversations:Darcy: ""And what am I to call you when I am cross? Mrs. Darcy?""Elizabeth: ""No, you may only call me 'Mrs. Darcy' when you are completely, perfectly and incandescently happy.""Darcy: ""And how are you this evening... Mrs. Darcy? Mrs. Darcy... Mrs. Darcy... Mrs. Darcy.""This ending, not in the novel, is apparently also not included in the UK and international versions of the film, having not gone over well with British audiences. As a North American audience member, I'm particularly glad this ended up in the release on this side of the globe - it is truly one of the most tender endings I've had the pleasure of watching. (It's also two more minutes of Matthew Macfadyen, which is so not a terrible thing.)For any woman who loves the Jane Austen classic, I'm sure she feels she owns Elizabeth Bennet, or sees herself in Elizabeth in one way or another, so obviously casting the role well was of great importance. Lizzie is strong, insightful, capable and witty - the model heroine - and Kiera Knightley was arguably the best choice for this role. There was effortless chemistry between her and each of the actors with whom she shared the screen.It's rare a book translates to film as exquisitely as this."	5.0	The original great love story	2007-01-23	11	8	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AKGK5WGO3IX8X	A Jane Austen Fan	I have seen a total of three different adaptations of this book.  By far, this was absolutely the WORST version of Pride and Prejudice I have ever seen.Keira Knightly is a HORRIBLE Elizabeth Bennett.  She makes Lizzie seem ridiculous and senseless.  She removes all the intellect that Elizabeth Bennett is known of having.  I do not know how she was nominated for an Oscar for this role.  The members of the academy must not have read the book before voting.The screenwriters should be ashamed of the hack job they performed on such a wonderful masterpiece.  There are major parts of the book that are missing form this version.  None of the characters are shown in a proper light.  Furthermore, it neither shows the bond between Lizzie and her father nor the bond between Lizzie and her sister, Jane.It took me two different occasions to try and make it through an entire viewing of this movie because I couldn't take the awfulness.  This version is not for a person whom considers himself/herself a Jane Austen fan.  If I could, I would rank this movie a negative five stars.If you want to watch a WONDERFUL version of P&P;, please watch A&E; version with Colin Firth.  This is by far the best version I have seen and I would recommend it to any Jane Austen fan.	1.0	Horrible, Awful, BARF!	2006-04-12	50	24	26

However, this movie does a pretty good job of condensing 122,618 words into 129 minutes of pleasing, albeit fast paced, visual entertainment.  The Blu-ray quality is lovely, I haven't had a need to use the DVD yet and the digital copy I will probably access via iTunes since I never managed to get my digital copy (which is a piece of paper with a code on it) of Tangled to work via Windows Media Center - and once you use those codes they are apparently lost to you forever.	5.0	I love this movie! &lt;3	2012-03-14	1	1	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1S26JXPQKFVPI	Alexander Arsov	"Of the four versions of ""Pride and Prejudice"" I have seen (1940, 1980, 1995, 2005), this one is definitely the nadir. To begin with, it's astonishingly ugly. It looks like the Middle Ages in Asia rather than like England of the early nineteenth century. Even after making the usual allowances for omissions and changes during the adaptation, the screenplay departs from Jane's original in a most deplorable way. It is this version, not the 1940 one, which is the real travesty, if not in terms of plot at all events in terms of characters.Whoever had the bright idea of casting Keira Knightley as Lizzy did a great disservice to the future generations. I shudder to think how many people will see this movie without any prior knowledge of the novel and will think, quite mistakenly, that Keira's portrayal has anything to do with Jane's; if they ever come to read the book later, they would probably be too full of pride and prejudice to really appreciate it. Keira's vapid performance, rife with hideous grins that apparently pass for smiles, is fully matched by the worst Darcy imaginable. The proud and conceited gentleman has been scaled down to a timid and tedious creature.The supporting cast, despite the presence of such illustrious names like Donald Sutherland (Mr Bennet who speaks his generally witty lines with a funereal air) and Judi Dench (Lady Catherine who sounds much more like Lady Macbeth), is no improvement over the weak principals. There is not a trace of Mr Collins' trademark pomposity or Mrs Bennet's equally typical (and fake) hysteria. Jane is supposed to be a placid creature, but is this one entirely devoid of life! The whole cast speak their lines in the most contrived and unnatural manner. All grace, charm and vivacity of the original have been lost.There is nothing redeeming about this movie (except, perhaps, Lydia and the interlude with the marble statues). In addition to the fabulous vapidity of the acting, this includes the mediocre production, the clumsy direction, the clipped and simplified dialogue. It's all matter of taste of course. But my idea of Pride and Prejudice has nothing to do with anorexic Lizzy, moronic Darcy and a bunch of talking mannequins who seem to have no idea what their lines mean. The praise lavished on this movie, by both critics and audience, is something I really don't understand."	1.0	Sheer travesty!	2012-11-08	18	14	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1LC7MJX5KX9YC	Alexander M. Zamora	I have always looked forward to movies interpreting Jane Austen's classic novels. When I learned that there might be a new P & P movie, I wonder how can this movie provide a new perspective to the acclaimed BBC production which starred an excellent and competent cast led by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. But here comes Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFayden, both goodlooking actors who provided the conflict, the feelings unspoken but sizzling through the screen, the fiery, passionate dialogue and the blissful happy ending that two people in love deserve so much. Excellent movie. More excellent script. Most excellent cast!	5.0	When you think the BBC/A&E special couldn't be topped, this film brings in a new fresh interpretation	2006-10-09	13	8	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1R75AAQ0WDWOT	"Alexandra126 ""Alexandra126"""	Oddly enough the BBC version features a more lavish production than this movie. Also, trying to condense the book into 2 hrs  cuts the characters into 2 dimesionals. This movie feels more like a stage production with the acting. Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench are the sole exceptions. Kiera Knightley does a good job but when compared to Jennifer Ehle - well no one compares to her acting. The Mr. Darcy in this movie looks incredible as does the handsome actor who plays Mr. Wickham yet even their acting is stiff though Darcy's gets better towards the middle half. This whole movie feels rushed - in a matter of 10 minutes we are introduced to Mr. Collins and then Mr. Wickham. We also only get one Bingley sister instead of 2.This could've been an incredible version but it was very disappointing. My sole gripe is not being as faithful to  the classic book as it should. I could overlook the acting and the sets if only this movie didn't cut and rearrange the book.	2.0	Looks pretty but cuts out much of the book, Not enough Details	2009-09-16	4	2	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A117LFJEM6VYTX	Alexandria David	Yes, this film has its flaws, as all remakes do, but it sticks to the main story, and that is what attracts Austen lovers to it.  If you are a real fan, then you will gobble this one up just as you have done the other ones that came out.  At first I did not see Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet either, and the fact that Hollywood could see anyone else as Darcy nearly made me go crazy, but these actors did a great job.  It's a different take and a very well done version for a new audience.  And yes, I have read the book ten million times and own the BBC A&E version.	5.0	Great	2006-03-22	10	5	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A39IBJB2PBVC7I	Alistair McHarg	Pride And Prejudice is an exuberant celebration of what movies do best.  In one meticulously constructed scene after another it showers viewers with eye candy and in so doing, transports them to a distant, fascinating place and time.  In a cynical age such as ours, where every image is suspect, this is more difficult than one might imagine; director Joe Wright's success is complete.Jane Austen's Pride And Prejudice has demonstrated Rocky-esque box office endurance.  Were she alive today, Austen might marvel at our attraction to this tale of marriage as business, crushing social stratification, and nuanced mannerisms - told with precision, wit, and irony - considering that our own society, though bloated with both pride and prejudice, possesses none of the refined subtleties she described.Apart from our Anglophile obsession, born of the indebtedness we feel for providing our culture, such as it is, this attraction is most easily traced to the character of Elizabeth (Keira Knightly), a smart, beautiful, and appealingly feisty young woman who holds out for love over financially-motivated marriage.  (Heresy!)  While older sister Jane (Rosamund Pike) may be lovelier, we root for Liz as she battles uphill. Her triumph does not seem facile, Liz is tested and must grow - indeed, we cheer her victory because we sense she will not abuse it.Superb performances abound, led by Judi Dench as Lady Catherine.  From her comfy chair on top of the food chain, Dench embodies the full force of social pressure as you've never seen it before - terrifying.  Matthew MacFadyen is compelling as Mr. Darcy, he has on-screen presence and commands attention with his quiet, thoughtful demeanor.  Keira Knightly carries the picture admirably, mischievous without being obnoxious, self-absorbed without being narcissistic, sharp-witted without being needlessly cynical.  Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Bennet) is wonderfully nutty, ambitious, and calculating while Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennet), workmanlike as ever, should have been told that a Canadian accent is not an English accent.  Tom Hollander, as Reverend Collins, isn't on camera much but is simply brilliant.Pride And Prejudice reveals a world where function follows form, not vice versa.  In one glorious scene the five Bennet sisters dance at a ball and Liz scrupulously avoids the advances of Reverend Collins while attempting to attract Darcy.  This is the carefully delineated atmosphere of Jane Austen; it's a wonderful place to visit.	5.0	Bride And Purchase Price	2006-07-20	6	3	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2YHLBUF1OTDNN	A Little ol' gal from &#34;Jaw-Ja&#34;	In 1 word, Inaccurate ~ they did NOT have Pigs running in and out of thier house!  The Bennett family wanted to be upper-class and would have died before they had live stock running through their home!  This is 100% Inaccurate/Unfaithful to the novel Jane Austen wrote.  30-40 minutes into the movie, I turned it off... Not to mention the colors they used in this movie - BLEGH!  Greys, Browns, Whites and Blacks ~ it makes everything look dirty and even dirtier.  Which is also why, I HATE this version. And don't even get me started on the acting ~ it's just as bad.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2985AXW1O2VSM	Allie B	Directed by Joe Wright, Pride and Prejudice (2005), is a remake of the original film from 1940 that tells a love story of a most unlikely couple that constantly battle against being together. In the end, they realize they are perfect for each other (sorry for ruining it). And of course, one cannot forget the classic scene of Mr. Darcy confessing his love to Elizabeth in the pouring rain, which is my favorite part. This film is for all the romantics, and the fans of the distinguished Jane Austen.It boasts a completely innovative soundtrack that fits the film perfectly. Dario Marianelli composed a beautiful assortment of piano pieces as well as full orchestration sequences that complete the film and allows the audience to feel immersed in the Victorian time period. Another aspect that is effectively conveyed by the music is how it asserts how the audience should be feeling throughout the film.The cast is especially impressive, including Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennett, and Matthew Macfayden as the timeless Mr. Darcy. The sweet and witty demeanor of the characters creates an atmosphere that is sure to impress any audience. Vitality and life are strong influences that create a sense of happiness in practically every scene.Classiness is overwhelming in this film, and the story is basically the same as the book, which I find refreshing, despite the trend of changing the movie entirely from the way things are originally in the book. This film is a perfectly crafted ingenious production, and is definitely my favorite movie.	5.0	A Timeless Classic!	2013-06-21	2	2	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1ZCPLKEDDWEN9	Amanda S.	"When I heard that a new version of Pride & Prejudice was being filmed, I doubted that it could ever meet the standard set by the 1995 BBC miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, a fantastic adaptation of a book I've re-read too many times to count. It ended up being my favorite movie of 2005.Pride & Prejudice is a story that requires great performances in order to be fully effective. I originally didn't understand the choice of Keira Knightley for the role of Elizabeth Bennett, but she proved me wrong and did an absolutely wonderful job. Her Oscar nomination is well deserved. (But if she is ""plain"" looking, we're all screwed.) I LOVED Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy. Rather than imitating Colin Firth's well adored performance, he gave a new interpretation of the role that fit in perfectly. As Roger Ebert said in his review, it's ""well cast from top to bottom.""I'm normally a complete book snob. But despite the fact that it's not a entirely faithful adaptation (if it were, we'd have been sitting in the theater the entire day), I think it ultimately captures the essence of Jane Austen's novel. I don't know why some are getting so worked up over minute historical details that do not effect the quality of the film whatsoever. I liked the more ""modern"" additions made to the movie and the more rugged feel it has. Who wants to see a rehash of something that has already been done with the novel?I know the story like the back of my hand, but the way it was presented made me feel the same delight as when I read the book for the first time. I walked out of it on cloud nine. Watch it with an open mind, and you will too. Can't wait to own it on DVD."	5.0	Don't listen to the book/miniseries snobs!	2006-02-09	25	20	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AMIGVTZZIWS6I	Amazon Customer	"At first, you might be thinking, ""Why do we need yet another remake of Pride & Prejudice?""  It's a valid question.  I mean, it hasn't been that long since the BBC remade the famous story; however, this version of the Jane Austen classic is, in my opinion, the best one yet.  From the casting, to the adaptation, to the beautiful cinematography this is a far superior film.  If you loved Austen's novel, then you will love this film.  It stays true to the book better than any version I've seen and the casting is nearly perfect.  I'm not a huge fan of Kiera Knightley, but she was wonderful as Elizabeth Bennett.  Equally as good is Rosamund Pike as the lovelorn older Bennett sister, Jane.  Whenever she is on screen she far outshines any of the other actors around her.  Of course, there's Mr. Darcy as played by Matthew Macfadyen.  Throughout the film he has to play the sourpuss and condescending Darcy who is unwilling and unable to show true emotion; however, if you really watch Macfadyen's performance you can see so much just by looking at his eyes, which convey so much that is left unsaid.  When Darcy finally does let his guard down it's almost alarming.  The entire cast of this film, which is mostly British, but with some Americans thrown in for good measure, is just wonderful.  Director Joe Wright assembled the perfect group of people to play these roles."	5.0	A Lovely Film	2006-05-14	15	10	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AMFDNITEE3ZTQ	Amazon Customer	"I absolutely love Jane Austen and this movie did not do justice to the story.  There were so many historical inaccuracies I don't know where to begin.The Bennetts did not live on a dirty farm.  Mr. Bennett was a Gentleman part of the upper middle class and would have had property supporting that status.  He wouldn't have lived on a farm and he wouldn't have had a dog in the house.  They would have had a carriage.Mr. Wickham was almost nonexistent.Miss Bingley looked like she was wearing a corset at the Netherfield Ball  The costuming was wrong all around.Lizzy never was intentionally mean in her teasing.  There was one spot in the movie where I was wanting to scream because they changed the dialog from the book.  Where she's at Netherfield and she and Darcy are having one of many verbal sparing matches and he's talking about pride being a failing in the movie they have her saying, ""I love to laugh, but I cannot""  Howeverin the book she says, ""That is a failing indeed, but I cannot laugh at it"".Mr. Darcy walks into the Collins' home in the middle of the night into her bedroom without anyone hearing him?  Outside of that being a no-no particularly back then, The Collins' at least had a servant.Lady Catherine Jeudi Dench was a great Lady Cathrine.  Which is why I don't mind paying the rental fee.  However she wouldn't have come to the Bennett's house in the middle of the night to have it out with Lizzy.  What's the point of mentioning the Bennett's have a small park on one side of the house if you're not going to walk in it.  The argument between Lady Cathrine and Lizzy is one of the best cat fights in literature and they ruin it.Mr. Bingley is portrayed as a bumbling idiot and Darcy has to work with him to get the nerve up to ask Jane.  When he had his mind made up in the first place and was a bit upset when Darcy concealed Jane being in town.Georgiana Darcy was not outgoing.  In fact she was rather shy.There are so many more things I could mention, but I think I've made my point.  I have no problems with modernized versions of Pride and Prejudice, but if your going to do it within a period piece that's where I draw the line.  Either do the proper research of the period and get it right or don't do it at all."	1.0	This movie made me want to cry	2007-01-15	158	115	43

The sparks between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett were so tangible and juicy!  I really enjoyed this movie.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2Z08K9S4N0MVQ	Amazon Customer	"I love-love-love the BBC miniseries P & P.  I could not wait for the new P & P to come out in theatres.  When it did, I was surprised to find that I love-love-love the new P & P as well.  I had people ask ""Which do you like better?"" and I could not answer because I loved both so much.  I recently ordered the new P & P on DVD and watched it back-to-back with the BBC miniseries to see if there was ANY way to determine if I had a preference.  In the end, I decided that I do like the BBC one a teeny-tiny bit more because I enjoy how much more exaggerated the characters are.  In the BBC version, Mrs. Bennett is more of an annoying drama queen and Mr. Collins is more repulsive (nearly impossible to imagine that ""old maid"" Charlotte would consent to marrying him - ugggh!).  In the new P & P, it seems more believable that Elizabeth would ""come around"" to Mr. Darcy because he is less ""standoffish"" than Colin Firth's character in the BBC version.  I enjoyed Keira Knightly in the new version but there was something about what I call Jennifer Ehle's ""secret amused smile"" in the BBC version that I feel really helps define Elizabeth's character.  All in all, if you're a P & P fan - you should own both.  If you are a person pressed for time - watch the shorter (new) version and if you have the time - watch the miniseries!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1TV5FU0WXFSBI	Amazon Customer	"The scenery in this version of Pride and Prejudice was absolutely gorgeous. That is the one positive comment I can give this film.But a coyly giggling Elizabeth? When did Jane Austen ever intend the strongest female character she's ever written to be reduced to a girlish and immature giggler? Elizabeth is supposed to stand out among all the other girls as clever and quick witted, not a vapid silly girl the way her sisters are depicted. After all, is Jane Austen's Elizabeth the prettiest? No. Is the the smartest? No. Is she even the most talented? No. But that was the point! She stil has so much confidence and gumption that she can tell Darcy and his aunt off with skill and articulation.And Darcy? He's supposed to be proud. Not bland and boring.The proposal scene was an utter sham. How could the makers of this movie change the articulate monologues Elizabeth and Darcy recite and cut them up into dialogues to suit the modern audience's short attention span. Couldn't they sit through the monologues and feel the full punch of the words instead of having to have them disected into a back and forth dialogue which Austen clearly did not intend for them to be.I felt like the movie was trying to shout the entire time ""Look at this zoom in of the pig, look at this interesting angle of the Pemberly House from the ceiling! Look at me! There is a director for this movie! Forget about the timeless dialogue. There is a director in this movie and I won't be ignored!"""	2.0	Hollywood Direction Overtakes Austen Writing	2006-09-10	18	9	9
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AQI6WC9XQWJ4E	"Amazon Customer ""linden53"""	Just for fun, I watched the Director's commentary with the film and now understand why watching this film is like looking through a broken kaleidoscope. It starts with birds chirping on a beautiful landscape, moves to an odd close up, over the shoulder, of a book Lizzie is reading, but you can't see the title of, then has her walking over a FILTHY duck pond into a working farm house, eavesdropping on her parents.The whole movie goes back and forth between modern use of cameras against a backdrop of regency styles. The family, the costumes, the houses, are all regency, while the camera work fractures the story-telling with its movement from harshly lit close ups to single hand held shots. In the commentary, even the director admits Dame Judy Dench looks awful in her close ups when she comes to visit Lizzie in the middle of the night to confront her about Darcy's proposal. He talks about getting ideas on the way to filming different scenes - like the sunlit close up of Lizzie when she travels to Derbyshire with her aunt and uncle came to him when he put his head out the car door in the sunlight when he was going to a film location.This story seems filmed a bit off the hip, or off the cuff - improvised!I still love it. The unspoiled landscapes are gorgeous. From the Longbourne house with its moat and surrounding wildlife and even the farm life to the gorgeous grecian temple in Wiltshire - I will try to go there now that I know where it is - where Darcy proposes makes me melt to the cadence of Matthew MacFadyen's voice. I want to go there just to listen to the echoes of the scene - in the rain, of course. He is a revelation as Darcy, although I can also picture him in modern terms as a spy in his series Spooks. But he is fun and sexy. The close up of his hand after he touches Elizabeth helping her into the carriage is glorious.I would recommend listening to the directors comments about ALL  his casting choices, what he feels about their performances, the design of the sets, and how he made his decisions in telling the story.  (the ribbon dyeing scene is wonderful).So I would recommend this film to anyone. But I would caution them that it is a clash of sensibilities - modern and regency.Thanks for making it.Emily Linden, RN, BA.	4.0	clash of cultures/modern versus regency	2008-09-03	7	4	3

It's Austen on hormones. The emotions are pumped up and the drama heightened.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1H11BV01L91I6	Ambergold	For those of us who are rabid Jane Austen fans, like myself, who went in to watch this looking forward to it but not expecting much after watching the superb and nearly-flawless BBC miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth countless times, this movie was a joyous and exhilerating shock. I admit that after watching the preview and reading everything there was to read about it before it  came out, I wasn't expecting much.I was still crazy-wild to see it-it looked very romantic and come on, its Pride and Prejudice-but Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy looked plain and boring, and some of the changes to the handling of the atmostphere and everything sounded very dubious. Having said that, I went in and came out stunned. The new movie is gorgeous, tender, passionate, lovely, fun. But mostly it brought back to me a feeling of what love is really like-that understanding that we've lost so completely after hordes of mediocre and wishy-washy romantic comedies and soap operas. The only thing that has come close to re-creating that feeling is Titanic,and I thought that Pride and Prejudice did a better job. And Matthew MacFadyen was superb as Darcy. He is Darcy-he captures a different version, a different part of him than Colin Firth, but he is as utterly him as Firth was. The man was perfect-by the end of the movie you are utterly in love with him. He starts out, like the movie,a little bit of a nonentity-you're not sure whether you like him or not. Then both he and the movie pick up speed and from there it just gets better and better until the ending, which is as nearly perfect as a movie ending can be. Don't mistake me-the old Pride and Prejudice will always in the end be the quintessential one, and Colin Firth's Darcy remains at the peak-but this movie is very nearly as good and MacFadyen's Darcy is really just as good, in a very different way(I never thought I would say that). MacFadyen played him with shyness, intensity, subtlety, warmth, idiocy, humour, and charm by turns,and by doing so turns out a very human and completely-perfect man. And his chemistry with Keira Knightley is exquisite-a miracle. In the end that is what makes up the movie-they light up the screen together. I haven't seen anything like it since-well-Titanic, and this movie shows it up in that area as well. Like the producers said after it was released,when they got the two actors together on the set something happened and they became their characters-two characters madly in love with each other.(Keira Knightley is just as good as MacFadyen-another mild surprise-she plays her with a delicacy and warmth completely lacking in most of her other performances.The moment when she steps down from the carriage and looks up at Pemberley and releases a quick bubble of laughter made up of equal part irony, delicious laughter,regret, and a sense of the ridiculous, is a cinematic moment that won't come again, and only she could have produced it).After watching it,I came out of the theater poised between sheer joy and hysterical laughter, and feeling an intense desire to be in love with someone-that is what the movie did to me.It is flawed-Jane and Bingley are pretty much ruined and several very important plot points are brushed over or ignored-the producers seemed to feel about two-thirds of the way throught the movie that they'd better speed it up,and so they rush through several major events at breakneck speed-but other things make you forgive them for it.Lady Catherine and Mr. Collins, while very different versions than in the BBC one, are good once you get used to them, and this is pretty much the case for all the minor characters with the exception perhaps of Bingley and his sister. Watch it, not really expecting it to be as good as the old one and definitely not hoping for the book, because it's not that-but it stands on its own as shining movie masterpiece of romanctic dramas.	5.0	It Shines...Near Perfection	2006-05-26	18	13	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1DG64PC729MSS	"amber heyman ""djsubkitten"""	I can't even say that I was disappointed. That would insinuate some great expectation from the film in the first place. It is nearly impossible to convey this Jane Austin novel within two hours. Plus, going up against the predecessor, A&E; version, with Colin Firth and Jennifer Eyle, is suicide. Given the perameters that Keira Knightly had to work within, her performance was marginal at best that only reflected a marginal interpretation on the writer's part.For those who have read the novel or seen any of the preceeding renditions you will know that the Bennett's were not poor in the sense that they lived on a filthy farm and had not a pot to piss in. The Bennett's were lacking in wealth due to having so many daughters,but they were by no means destitute. The writer of this version makes the Bennetts out to be filthy poor by making the family have greasy hair and tatered clothes. The writer again gave no regards to the relationship between each of the family members. How witty Elizabeth was or how much her father doted on her, or how close she was to her older sister, of how the mother favored Lydia most, and how everything vexxed her mother and everything that vexxed her was her husbands fault. Some of the best deliverence comes from the sarcasm that comes from the fathers remarks to the behavior of the younger daughters and that of the mother. These senitments are completely ignored and delivered to the screen, was the exact opposite, a happy loving couple.The next issue was the complete lack of sexual tension between Elizabeth and Darsey. Which in turn takes away from the climax of the film, when he asks her to marry him. If you cannot deliver that part of the story, you have no movie to put on screen.If you want to see a great Jane Austin novel, go to the people that do it the best.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A13M46AA1NXU7W	"A. Meenagh ""seeking inspiration"""	I will confess upfront that I am a huge fan of the A&E;/BBC version of P&P.; No production, when compared to that version, will measure up. That having been said, this version is so poorly written and cast that I find it difficult to sit through. After watching the short documentary on the making of the film on the DVD, it is obvious that no one connected with this film did any serious study of Austen or the novel. The director comments on this being about an 18th century family--no, it's early 19th century-- and about how Mr. and Mrs. Bennet loved one another and their daughters so deeply. Again, not really.Keira Knightley is awful in the role of Elizabeth Bennet who was a sophisticated and witty young woman, of scrupulous manners. Knightley's portrayal of a giggly, silly, tempermental girl is absurd.Matthew Macfayden's Darcy is depressed, laconic and stutteringly shy. Austen's Darcy was well-spoken, proud and elegant, not in need of a Prozac.Rather than showing the development of Darcy as a character, he is a mere caricature.The Bennets come across like a 19th century version of the Beverly Hillbillys with a manor house crumbling around their ears, greasy hair, dirty clothes and hogs roaming about the house. Austen would have been agast!If you are an Austen devotee, you will be distressed by this film. So many unpleasant liberties are taken that I cannot begin to enumerate them. The tone and meaning are completely lost.	3.0	Hello? Did you even read the book?	2006-08-02	28	22	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1LGMC4XUA1PHD	AmKiwi	Although this movie is good as far as it goes, the story has been cut down to fit into a typical 2 hour movie theater time slot. And unfortunately, the story was butchered to do it. The part of George Wickham was almost entirely cut out of this version. He is one of the original central characters not only for the famous elopement but also because he fools Lizzy as to his true character so completely and helps to form her prejudice against Mr. Darcey. We see Wickham maker a couple of brief appearances in this movie and that's it: very disappointing. Go see the BBC version if you want a better version of the story.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A211A22QX6L8E2	"Amorhi of Roftlen ""Keeper of Light"""	The 2006 production of Pride and Prejudice is a work of photographic art. Breathtaking scenery, creative and graceful camera movements, and smooth transitions make this film a visual pleasure. A romantic and sweeping score carries you along through the classic story.The actors in this film, provided that they had a limited amount of time to develop their characters on screen, did a remarkable job, although sometimes some spoke too quickly, almost rushed, as if trying to get it over with. There is, however, a wonderful chemistry between all of them. Two thumbs up for the casting director, as well as the actors themselves.I personally love Jane Austen's classic story, and while I am a huge fan of the BBC version (starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as Darcy and Elizabeth), I can say that I really do enjoy this new film. It certainly is much shorter and easier to watch in one sitting, although bits of the storyline are lost in the shortness of it.Overall, I highly recommend this film to anyone. If you haven't seen it, I recommend renting it, to see if you like it. If you end up liking it as much as I do, you just may end up purchasing it like me, too.	5.0	A Breathtaking Peace	2006-07-29	13	10	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AT29GZBXKJVXG	A Movie Fan	"I was very disappointed with this movie and surprised by my disappointment. I had been looking forward to a big screen version for a long time.But the screenwriter took too many liberties with her script, adding lines that were both out of character and out of place. There's really no need to embellish when you have a book as good as Pride and Prejudice. The departures from the text not only distracted me, some of them actually made me cringe! ""You have bewitched me body and soul,"" Darcy whispers at one point. It sounds as if the writer is attempting to write like Austen (or any author, for that matter, pre-1900), but she doesn't know how! And it gets even worse when Elizabeth explains to her father (and I'm paraphrasing as I don't plan on watching the film again soon), ""We are SO similar! He and I are both stubborn."" Clearly, the screenwriter has abandoned all attempts to even sound like Austen. And ""goddess divine?"" - she cut some of P&P;'s best lines to add THAT!The quality of the acting is okay, but Keira Knightley doesn't exude the grace and wisdom that her predecessors, Jennifer Ehle and Greer Garson, did. She looks lovely but too fierce. I think it may be her jaw. She delivers her lines as if she may bite at any moment. I never envisioned Elizabeth Bennet as an angry sort of girl - spirited, yes, but not spit-in-your-face angry like she is in this movie. I think Rachel Weisz would have made a great Elizabeth (although she might be considered too old for the part - hey, if Emma Thompson can play Elinor Dashwood...)Rosamund Pike, on the other hand, is perfect as Jane - much better than the actress in the A&E; version. Matthew MacFadyen is appropriately swoonworthy with an impressively deep voice (and tall enough, too, as Mr. Darcy should always be). Brenda Blethlyn is good, but I had this strange deja vu watching the film, as if she had played this role before. One more thing: what's up with Bingley's hair? He looked like Conan O'Brien or the villain in The Incredibles and acted like a buffoon. It doesn't make much plot sense b/c he should be worthy of Jane's affection and admiration.For fans of the novel, I can't recommend this film. The filmmakers have played too fast and loose with the details that make Austen distinctly Austen. Instead, check out Sense and Sensibility for how an adaptation should be done."	3.0	Main Problems With This Film: Screenplay and Knightley	2006-03-15	29	18	11
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AE7920G30347J	Amrita Chaudhry	"Highly Disappointing!!!  Do yourself a favor and save that $20 bill for a lofty purpose.  Don't buy this movie.  You may like this new version ""ONLY"" if you have not watched the A&E;'s (T.V mini series) of Pride and Prejudice by Simon Langton.I've an ardent admirer of Jane Austen's novels and have watched the mini series and it has been a priceless possession of my video library for years. I fell in love with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, the first time I watched the movie. Watching it, you transcend into the realms of English Aristocracy and get mesmerized by the characters in the movie.... Mrs. Bennet a lovable woman, Mr. Colins, Caroline Bingley and Mr. Wickham. You name it - ""ALL"" the characters are adorable and the beauty of it is, one tends to identify with the characters.BUT this NEW Pride and Prejudice, starring Knightly is a ""SOUR GRAPE""! Immature, Poorly portrayed, Emotional blunder. Does not do justice to the 18th Century England. Characters in the movie are annoying, including - Mr. Darcy, who is expressionless and knows not, how to hold himself! Colin Firth on the other hand was elegant and charming. Elizabeth Bennet (Knightley) has this unwanted, weird smile on her face, at times, that bothers me. Mr. & Mrs. Gardiner are worthless. Mr. Bingley is funny with a horrible hair-do and weak gestures. Basically EVERY single character looks fake. The costumes are no where close to tolerable. There is no bond between sisters in this movie like you could see in the previous Jennifer Ehle version of it.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AH93HX89KVQG2	"Amy Green ""Amy Green"""	"First of all, no film adaptation can ever compare to the book itself. If you enjoyed whichever film version you've seen, including this one, read the book! You'll love it.I have read the book countless times. The 1980 BBC production starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul is the most accurate and thorough adaptation in my opinion. I don't care for the newer and more popular 1996 A&E; version because of the MANY liberties it takes, although the visuals are gorgeous. (You can read my comparison review of those two on their product listing pages:Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980)andPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)).When I saw the preview for this new version, it just looked very ""Hollywood-ish"" -- over-emotive, mangled dialogue, too sappy and dramatic. And it seemed that Darcy, who is supposed to be handsome on the Adonis level, looked way too plain for the role. But I knew I had to watch it anyway, and I was pleasantly surprised. Although a lot of the book's scenes were left out to fit into the 2-hour time frame, the dialogue and scenes were well-chosen and more faithful to the book than I expected. Despite the shorter length, this newest movie version still captured the spirit of the novel. Each actor did wonderfully in his or her role... including wonderful appearances from Donald Sutherland as the droll yet affectionate Mr. Bennett, and Dame Judi Dench as the odious Lady Catherine De Burgh.My husband who likes to avoid sappy `chick flicks' even walked in the room while I was watching it, and sat down and watched the rest of it with me and really enjoyed it. (He had also enjoyed the 1980 BBC version).My complaints about it are:1) Mr. Bingley's hair looks utterly ridiculous (it's like a furry red dog sitting on top of his head) and I had to laugh every time he appeared on the scene.2) Speaking of hair, many characters did seem undergroomed, with very messy hair, no jewelry and very plain, drab-looking outfits; especially Elizabeth. I hated that brown dress! I guess they had to find a way to make Kiera Knightley seem less pretty than the actress playing Jane, which is certainly difficult since Kiera is considered one of the most beautiful women in the world. Add to that the messy scenes of pigs and farming and laundry hanging out to dry at the Bennett home, the whole family seemed perhaps of a lower class than they actually were... as if the director wanted to 'gritty' them up a bit.3) Mr. Darcy does not acknowledge to Elizabeth how much she helped him change to be more humble and considerate of others. One of the best lines in the book is when he says to her: ""... dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you? You taught me a lesson... by you I was properly humbled."" This is an important point, because one foundation of their love is their gratitude to each other for the changes each brought about in the other. In this version, the impression is given that it was only Elizabeth who was ever in the wrong and needing to change.4) Some liberties were of course taken with dialogue and the timing of events, and there were some contrived/invented scenes, including things that were not in the book at all, and things that would not have been appropriate for that time period. (Hollywood has never learned to leave well enough alone.) Examples include: family members hovering over every closed door to hear the conversations therein, and giggling and gawking at the people who had been conversing as they come out of the door; the 'rejected proposal' scene happening outside in the rain and them almost kissing (??!!??) during it; Lady Catherine visiting late at night; the `married' scene at the end; Mr. Bingley appearing in Jane's sickroom; a room of mostly naked statues in the Darcy home instead of the book's wall portraits (guess they had to get SOME sensuality in there somewhere); a sleepless Darcy and Elizabeth meeting up in the fog in the wee morning hours. Some of these were cool things in and of themselves; just not Austen. Bronte, maybe?But for some reason, those discrepancies did not bother me as much as they might have, and I think it is because they were so well offset by the positives of the film that had me really enjoying it and appreciating what I felt it DID pull out of the novel well. I had complaints of a similar nature about the 1995 A&E; version, but there wasn't enough `good' to offset my annoyance at what I considered `bad' in that version, whereas in this version the good outweighed the bad for me by more than enough. I think it's certainly a great introduction for anyone who is new to Austen.I did not think I would say this, but I will definitely buy this movie. It is an obviously romanticized version, but the added romanticism didn't bother me like I thought it would, and I found myself enjoying it."	4.0	Greatly exceeded the expectations of this die-hard Austen book fan!	2006-09-10	14	10	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AKQFIKZNANJV3	Andrea K. Johnson	I own the mini-series version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, which is more true to the book, but I think this is the more entertaining film. Other reviewers have discussed the difference in performances by actors who are closer to the actual ages of the characters in the book and the more realistic setting. One difference between book and movie that I appreciated was the director's take on the relationship between the Bennet parents and his expansion of the minor characters. Here, Mr. Bennet is both exasperated by and in love with Mrs. Bennet; Mr. Collins is as annoying as ever, but we also sympathize with his vulnerability and social awkwardness. Elizabeth's sister Mary is still a preachy bluestocking, but the film doesn't just make fun of her; we also her as the awkward teenage girl who sobs in her father's arms after being embarrassed at the ball. The five girls are very convincing as sisers and their embarassing mama loves them dearly. Bingley is as shy as Jane and here we see Darcy helping him rehearse his marriage proposal to her. Darcy and Elizabeth seem a little more raw and REAL here. The director has really gotten at the humanity of all of the characters here in a way that adds a lot to the film. That, and it's not six hours long, which should appeal to anyone who doesn't have the patience to sit through the mini-series.	5.0	Lovely film adaptation.	2008-11-08	9	6	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I don't know if I'll every truly know why, but I absolutely LOVE this movie.It's not as brilliant as `Sense and Sensibility' (mostly because it lacks the splendor that is Kate Winslet) but `Pride and Prejudice' is a perfect family film that builds off its subject to create a beautifully crafted masterpiece.  The performances match the surroundings and the direction by newcomer Joe Wright is astoundingly accurate and beautiful to look at.  Keira Knightley rightfully earned that Oscar nomination, for her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is the best by far of anyone attempting at the coveted role.  The fact remains that `Pride and Prejudice' has been done and redone and supposedly mastered by BBC (and Colin Firth) in 1995.  While that is the case this beautiful reimagining of the classic Austen novel is, in my humble opinion, the best film adaptation, by far.The film, aside from being splendidly acted, is above and beyond a beauty to look at.  Each frame is astounding in its visual flare.  The camera pans out over the surroundings with beautiful precision.  Just watch the fog scene with Darcy and know that a picture speaks a thousand words.  It's graceful and mesmerizing.The film follows the love affair (or lack there of) between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, a pair made in Hollywood heaven.  She's strong-willed and opinionated as is he and they seem to butt-heads more than steal hearts but in the end there is no denying they are perfect for one another.  What makes this movie so brilliant is that it is in affect the catalysts for almost every other love story out there for these two characters seem to pop up in almost every teen film produced as of late.  These are the originals though, and with splendid performances by Knightley and Macfadyen are so effortless and uplifting in their impish immaturity that they breathe a whole new life to the classic tale.The supporting cast all hold their weight as well, especially the likes of Donald Sutherland who is perfectly cast as Elizabeth's father and Brenda Blethyn who plays her mother, but it's Dame Judi Dench who stole the show for me with her few moments of screen time.  She plays Lady Catherine de Bourg with such ferocity that her confrontation with Elizabeth was the highlight of the film for me.In the end I can only say good things for this film for I cannot find a single flaw.  Watching Keira chew up the scenery is orgasmic for me, especially when you think that this is the same girl who fights pirates and hunts criminals.  Under that action hero exterior is a giggly teenage girl who becomes so real to her audience that you can't help but fall madly in love with her.  `Pride and Prejudice' is a wonder of a film, a beautifully magnificent cinematic experience that brings nothing but joy and warmth to my heart.So I guess I do know why I love this film after all...go figure.	5.0	Beautiful, mesmerizing and, simply put, utter perfection...	2007-11-19	16	11	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3IYP3MS6N8ZKV	Andria Redlin	"I have only read the book one time, after getting completely hooked on the 1995 A&E; version of Pride and Prejudice and watching it about six times this year alone, so I am probably not the most qualified person to write my objections to the 2005 piece of filth, but after reading what everyone else had to say, I could not keep silent either. Here are my objections as follows:1. Kiera Knightley- Hollywood clearly cannot tell the difference between a great actress better suited to the role of the intelligent Elizabeth Bennett (as in, almost anybody but K.K.) and a walking, talking, beanpole who claims to have read the book, but I don't think she did because if she had she would not have fudged this role up so badly with all the excessive giggling, outspokenness to her parents that was more or less non-existant during that time period, and for goodness sakes, somebody tell her to please close her mouth. Sexiness is appropriate in modern-day romantic comedies, but NOT in period pieces such as this one, or at least not the kind K.K. displayed. A woman from that time certainly did not run around outside with her hair down, or in her nightgown, and they almost never went outside without a hat or bonnet of some sort, which, I can't recall seeing K.K. wearing one, even after forcing myself to watch this film three times. Also, somebody please tell that girl to eat once in a while! I find it hard to believe that somebody from that time period, who did no housework and clearly had time to kill by making the audience sick by spinning on a swing, could be that skinny, when a typical daily diet from back then included a great consumption of whole milk, cheese, butter, bread, and eggs. Fattening fare that would have made a person look at least healthy, not like somebody who had not even seen puberty. Kiera Knightley was totally wrong for that role, having too modern of a face, and too thin a figure. I'm sorry Kiera, but you should stick with modern flicks. As a final irritation on this subject, I might add that she rattled her lines off so fast in some scenes that I hardly knew what she said, which is pretty sad for a person like me who is more than familiar with the dialogue. I believe that in a film with language that is as old as this, the lines should be spoken more slowly, to give our modern minds time to translate and understand what was said.2. Fitzwilliam Darcy- I felt absolutely nothing for this film's portrayal of the character whatsoever. There was nothing in him that made him the least bit likeable or desireable, and that haunted look that was constantly plastered to his face just depressed me.3. Charlotte Lucas- '""Don't judge me, Lizzy!""' Pul-eeeze. The film portrayed Charlotte's acceptance of Mr. Collins as being that she was unhappy to be marrying him, like she was trapped. In the book, she was actually in persuit of a comfortable home, and wasted no time in securing Mr. Collins for herself, even though he was not necessarily her first choice. But being older than the typical marrying age back then, beggars cannot be choosers, as the saying goes, and she may have become one eventually had she remained a spinster.4. The Costumes- I thought they were completely inaccurate for the time period, and terribly boring and colorless, especially the one Knightley wore in her first scene. Yuck, and I don't know what was up with her hair, but it just did not go with her modern-looking face. Speaking of hair, I didn't know that Marie Antoinette was cast to play Lady Catherine de Burgh. And could anybody honestly tell Lydia and Kitty apart with their identical pigtail/ringlet combinations?I honestly do not know how in the world this movie received four stars from the critics, who quite obviously have never read this book. I am sorry for the hordes of disappointed fans out there who were expecting something great (as I did), only to get spoon-fed this '""barely tolerable""' adaptation, only to choke on it after the credits rolled. Congratulations Hollywood, on ruining yet another (what could have been a) great film (just like Eragon got ruined) by attempting to 'modernize' it and change it to what you think the audience would want. Well, if it isn't broken, don't fix it! This is one of those stories in which everything was perfectly fine just the way it was. But (surprise!) some idiot out there had to open their mouth and suggest 'changes.' Well, would it be too much of a 'change' to get it right? If you are watching Pride and Prejudice for the first time, watch the A&E; Firth and Ehle version. I haven't seen the one that was made in the 1980's yet, but I am willing to bet that it totally blows away the 2005 version.Anecdote: I eventually did view the 1980's version of Pride and Prejudice, and it WAS way better than the 2005 version!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A14MOU9MF0NNVB	"Angela ""Angel"""	"I just watched this for the millionth time, and I loved it all over again. The cinematography is fantastic and artfully done. The classical music score is so soothing and perfectly suits the story. The whole movie gives you a sense of life with the Bennets that is so real. They are a family whose quirks and charms are immediately evident, and you fall in love with them all. I like that the Bennetts house is so well lived-in and even a little dirty looking. There is a lovely contrast between their poorer household to the richer settings of Mr. Bingley's temporary residence and especially Mr. Darcy's home at Pemberly.Keira Knightley is such a wonderful Elizabeth Bennett. She is natural and witty and somewhat angelic, but she's still a little rough around the egdes and down to earth. I like how she seems silly at times but still knows how to conduct herself properly without coming off as a snob. She's confident but still maintains an innocent quality.Matthew Macfadyen is the hottest Darcy to walk the planet, in my opinion. At first, I wasn't sure about him, because he looked so much like a sourpuss when he made his entrance to the film, but, as his character transforms, he becomes more handsome and eventually just completely sexy - this is where I can see why Jane Austen first titled the book First Impressions. If that title had stuck, it would certainly still work for this story. All the little nuances of Darcy's - the stolen glances, the tension in his hands, etc. - were all captured perfectly on camera and really brought his secret longing for Elizabeth into focus for the audience.I have to add that there were moments when I wanted to jump through the screen and bite Darcy's bottom lip. For example, the rainy day scene was so intense...if I were Elizabeth, I'd be tempted to just say screw pride, I'm yours! And she almost looks like she will. But seriously...Matthew Macfadyen is exactly how I would want my own Darcy to be. The scene where he walks through the dew-covered field at dawn in his flowing coat and his boots and high-waisted pants, YUM! I'm so glad they kept that shot in real time so the audience can watch every single sway of his hips. Wow. Oh, and this is my favorite line of his, ""You have bewitched me, body and soul."" Who talks like that anymore?! I love it!I like the BBC version...Colin Firth is such an awesome, sexy Darcy, too, and now we have this modern, more sexually tense P&P.; Wow, two great P&P; versions, Austen fans should rejoice about that!"	5.0	Amazing...and another hot Darcy!

However, it's really not necessary.But why choose?  Sure, they took liberties with this adaptation, but to me that makes sense -- it was the only direction to go after the definitive ""traditional"" rendition with the gorgeous BBC miniseries.  They did it all beautifully in that one.The 2005 version, it's grittier, faster, a little more brutal and sad too. I personally loved it -- it's fresh and fast and a new and lovely view of the story.  It's surprisingly swift-moving, very energetic, and a gorgeously made movie.  The acting is superb and the writing is great. It is not paced at all the way you expect these things, and I love the fact that (thanks to a few liberties with the book's time period) it looks and feels somehow very vibrant and real and just a little grungy.  The homes, the clothes, everything looks so real and lived-in (not frilly and clean and perfect the way these things usually are).  Even the dashing hero, who is quite hot, has terrible hair. And Kiera Knightley, who is not always a favorite of mine, is lovely and wonderful here. In this role, it's believable that (as beautiful as she is) that she is not fashionably beautiful or even noticeable, that her smarts and vivacity would be off-putting.  She is absolutely wonderful here, as is the entire cast (and Donald Sutherland is smashing in a scene very late in the movie as well).And yes, I still love Colin Firth.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3LK5ALS0KX73V	Angela Raspberry	The first time I watched this movie I compared it to the BBC mini-series with Colin Firth, the ultimate Darcy. Firth is a  handsome man even without saying a word.  Matthew MacSpayden looks like a normal person who could use a haircut.  Then I started googling and reading interviews with the actors and directors and came to an appreciation of this work.  Matthew MacSpayden had not read P&P or seen the BBC version before he played the role.  His Darcy isn't as arrogant as Firth's although he is still proud and prejudiced!  Keira Knightley does a wonderful job.  Her Lizzy is full of energy and life!  The story is not followed EXACTLY as the book was written but I found the differences acceptable and reasonable.  The ending is a little weird---it was written for the American audience apparently.  The directing is fast-paced and dramatic (they had to squeeze the whole thing into 2 hours, unlike the 6 hour mini-series) and I love the music.  Several scenes weren't even planned, they just came about---the solo ballroom scene and the proposal-practicing scene with Darcy and Bingley.  And the sculpture gallery at Pemberley, especially the veiled woman, was amazing.	5.0	Just as good as the Firth version but in a different way	2014-03-18	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ACP28G1OX38YD	"angusmacscottie ""RJB"""	I find that I was quite mistaken in my first impression of the new (now out on DVD) P & P movie with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. When I saw it in the theatre I was distressed by what I then considered the squalidness of the Bennet household. After viewing the Keira Knightley/Matthew Macfadyen DVD version a number of times, my opinion now is quite the opposite from my first impression. My delight in this movie comes from the complex and complete portrayal of the Bennet family; and after all, that entire family is the protagonist in the Austen novel. Austen created a love story about Lizzie and Darcy, but she also beautifully creates for us the texture of real 19th century country life as lived by the Bennet family. While I have loved the A & E version for many years, I must admit that I have always been a little perplexed by it because I do not think that the A & E version portrays so great a difference between the Bennet and Darcy circumstances as to cause the least amount of doubt in Darcy's mind about whether he should marry Lizzie. This new version puts it out there, unmistakably. It definitively and masterfully portrays the differences between town and country life, so skillfully written about by Jane Austen.

But then, a faithful translation would run far too long for a feature film (c.f. the A&E version, which runs to six hours). And in spite of the absence of Colin Firth, it was well-acted -- Keira Knightly's Elizabeth in particular.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2MVRR773PQMN6	"Annalea ""Mom and Reader."""	First off, I'm a BIG fan of Colin Firth, and I've loved the BBC miniseries for many years.But.I think that Matthew Macfayden is, honestly, the best Darcy. Hands down.  Kiera Knightley did a great job (I wish she hadn't been quite so belligerent at the end of his first proposal), and the liveliness and sparkle to this version really outshines all others.  It reminds me of Kenneth Branaugh's Shakespeare works . . . which I have long loved.  People are people are people . . . have been, and always will be . . . and I loved how this version really allowed us to see what the characters felt.  One of my favorite things about this version is seeing how startled Darcy is by his attraction to Elisabeth; and how he struggles against it, but can't keep himself from doing small things like taking her hand as she steps into the carriage when leaving Bingley's.  Elisabeth, shocked, looks down, and we see his hand grasping hers for a second . . . and then him stretching and closing his fist as he walks away, his hand full of electricity from her touch.  I mean, really . . . it's superb.  And the way Macfayden's face opens and turns so tender and vulnerable when he speaks to Elizabeth simply melts you.  He goes so well from icy pride to elecctrified yearning.  I really wish that this version predated the BBC series, as some of the elements here would have really improved the other.  (I think it would have a feel more like the BBC Emma series, which is next on my list.)The director did a masterful job of filling nearly every minute of this film (which I wish was four hours long!) with so many things that let us into the whole story, instead of seeing it from the outside.  You feel the exuberance and love and annoyance that accompanies a household of five girls, and I dearly, dearly love Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett.Hate this version as you may, but I love it tremendously!Now, if there was only a director's cut edition . . . if anyone is listening, please make one!	5.0	Wonderful addition to Pride & Prejudice Tradition.	2012-04-21	4	3	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A14KZO6SE5HRXE	Ann Bui	I've watched the Sir Lawrence Olivier version, 1980 BBC miniseries, the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle and then this version.  The Firth/Ehle adaptation is the most faithful to the book in terms of preserving events and accuracy with the times but even then, scenes and characters were cut.  Adaptation is just that an adaptation otherwise for heaven sake's read the novel.  In an adaptation, the idea is to capture the essence of what Austen presents.  I feel this version fails on many accounts.  P&P is a romance.  In this movie, there is absolutely no chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy.  You can't root for them to get together because you wonder why they would want to be together at all.  P&P is also a comedy of manners.  Austen was the master of social satire.  In P&P, she critiques the aristocracy, the church, the army, the intelligentia and the frivolous with dry wit.  I saw very little of that in the movie. When you do a period movie, you have to get the feeling that you've gone away from the here and now and to another place.  The language is too modern such that when the actors utter a real line straight out of the novel, it seems very jarring.  It's ashame really because you have excellent actors like Brenda Blethyn(Mrs. Bennet), Tom Hollander(Mr. Collins), Penelope Wilton(Mrs. Gardiner)and Claudie Blakely(Charlotte Lucas).  The script and the direction are just subpar.  Many events occur in P&P but the book spans a year in the life of the Bennets.  All the events are smashed up next to one another.  You have no sense at all that the passage of time has occured.  You would think the story happened within two months.  I give this movie two stars because there were some good attempts to make this movie interesting.  Village life is not glamorous or clean.  The ages of the Bennet daughters are the most accurate with regard to faithfulness to the book.  Jenna Malone's performance as Lydia Bennet is lively and fun.  The sets and costume design were very good however the wind-blown hair on everyone was a bit too much for me.  In the end, all could have been forgiven for this movie if there had been excellent performances from the actors who played Lizzie and Darcy but they were hemmed in by a pedestrian script and mediocre direction.	2.0	Where's the chemistry?	2006-07-21	20	10	10

A young woman would NEVER go about in the dark in her night gown and coat. She would NEVER kiss a man before they were married.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A30HDH6JY3JCT2	"Annette Autrata ""autrata"""	I love Austen and have read the book and seen the BBC adaptation more than once. Since this movie is so much shorter, I knew there would be compromises, but I had still hoped that the film would bring Austen's loving, amused, witty and razor sharp view of the British society in the late 1700's across. The book is not just about two people who go through personal changes and external adversities to find each other in the end. Their romance is a case in point of the silliness, pretentiousness, the pride and the class-orientation of those times and how its inhabitants struggle with or submit to it.This film is a rounded romance that the American audience will love, fast-paced, with strong characters and a satisfying plot, dialog and ending - I appreciate it for that. Compared to the BBC version it also brought welcome realism and grit to the imagery with plainer costumes, dustier scenery and sweatier faces. But to be called an Austen adaptation I would have needed the characters to be much truer to Austen's originals:Lizzy is fun-loving, caring, witty and confident. But society calls for gentle females that know and appreciate their station - which of course is below that of men. Lizzy knows that and keeps her intellect hidden, bowing to society's  expectations and revealing her insights only to Jane or her father, not to the public. Knightley's version of Lizzy is still a delightful individual, but too self-assured, candid and rebellious.Jane, according to Austen is very sweet and good-natured, always trying to believe the best of people. She is also very delicate and coy, keeping her public dialog completely innocuous and her eyes mostly downcast.  Rosamund Pike makes Jane by far too confident and strong. Her deep suffering from Bingley's supposed rejection doesn't come across at all.Mr. Bennet's chief entertainment is his private amusement with his' wife's and his three younger daughter's silly preoccupation with men, fashion and gossip  plus his delight in his two older daughter's beauty and sense. He is truly funny, but that is appreciated only by Lizzy and Jane, the rest of the family either doesn't catch his quips or misinterprets them. Donald Sutherland only gets to play a kind but boring head of family, resigned to his life in an all-female household.The BBC version of Mr. Collins is wonderfully oily.  His stilted but eloquent dialog, his complete acceptance of the rules of societal ranks (total submission to Lady de Bourg and belief in superiority over the Bennets) are satisfyingly repulsive. Tom Hollander's version is only that of an ignorant idiot.I love Judy Dench as an actor, but here she is too regal, too charismatic. Austin gives Lady Catherine de Bourg superiority only through her riches, position and through a strong enough  intellect and inbred confidence to manipulate everyone around her. Austin makes her meddling and truly undeserving of the reverence offered her, especially by Collins.Finally Darcy. According to Austen he is smart, brooding, very proud but caring and generous. He is genuinely struggling with his own affection for Lizzy. His sense of propriety doesn't allow this connection especially in light of the disastrous impressions he gets from the rest of the Bennets. But his emotions are too strong to ignore. Colin Firth brought Darcy's contradicting feelings brilliantly to life in the BBC production, particularly in the key scene where he proposes and Lizzy rejects him. He is uncharacteristically nervous and fidgeting; he is hopeful, and vulnerable but also angry and confused. Matthew Macfadyen doesn't bring more than the anxiety that would be part of any marriage proposal - none of the underlying battle shows. The rest of the film doesn't see many emotions from Darcy beyond superiority and boredom - way too flat for what Austin had in mind.In summary, if you expect a delightful romance, you'll be satisfied, if you want Jane Austen's vivid and multi-layered  characters, social insights and scathing dialogs, you'll be disappointed.	3.0	A fine romance, but not an 'Austen adaptation'	2008-11-30	9	3	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2Q8ZIQHA01QNA	Ann F. Mcfarland	"When I heard that Pride and Prejudice was going to be made into a big screen production, I'll admit to having my doubts. After all, Hollywood and all its international affiliates have a notorious record of dumbing down everything they can get their little gold lam? hands on. But I never expected it to be quite as bad as this. Watching as both a theatre and historical preservation student, this movie had several deep flaws which kept it from being enjoyable.The film had four major problems in terms of theater: filmography, characterization, script and level of acting ability. The editing was just plain sloppy. This can be forgiven in a low budget film, but not one with so many famous names and so much funding as this film.And even the poor editing could be forgiven, had it not interfered with the characterization. As beautiful as the countryside may be, by the fifth-hundred shot of it, I am no longer enthralled. How about showing some character interaction that could further the plot, instead of Elizabeth merrily traipsing across a field? Truth be told, there seemed to be no time allotted to characterization in the absence of fields and the trotting over of.The plot moved along but the basic motivations of the characters were never understood. It seems that Lizzy abhors Darcy and then WHAM! THEY'RE IN LOVE! WHAM! THEY'RE SNOGGING! WHAM! THEY'RE MARRIED! WHAM! ROLL CREDITS! In the aftermath, you're still wondering why, how and when exactly she fell in love with him. I had a friend watch this with me, who had never read the book. At the end of the film, she turned to me and said, ""Wait, so Lizzy married Darcy because he was rich?"" And I really can't blame her, there was really no other indication as to why she suddenly became enamored of him.I come now to the most painful subject of this movie: the acting. Keira Knightley has one, and one role that she always MUST play in order to make her acting believable, Keira Knightley. In all her films she has played the in-your-face-fear-me-I'm-a-spunky-British-chick-rara feminism girl and it works for her in those other movies, because that is who she had to play. Here it does not work. While vivacious, certainly, she does not play the part of the witty ""connoisseur of human folly"" that is Lizzy Bennett. She does not have the depth or the grounding to do so. Her solution for difficult scenes is to put extra energy into her words. So Lizzy's confrontation with Darcy, instead a meeting of  tension filled, barely-civil clash between two headstrong individuals bent on their own way, becomes a pedantic shouting match between two children. Honestly, I was waiting for a ""I know you are, but what am I?"" to be thrown in there at any moment. This does not bode well, for Lizzy carries the entire plot.Matthew MacFadyen does a solid, though not spectacular, job as Darcy. He is able to convey both of Darcy's sides, however, his transition between them is often clumsy. The tension between Darcy and Lizzy is practically non-existent, and when it does manage to rear its head, it feels awakward and very formulated. Even wonderful actors such as Donald Sutherland and Dame Judi Dench do not act to the best of their abilitiesThen again, how could they pull off a stellar with the script they were given? The writers appeared the think it necessary to exclude some of Jane Austen's most famous lines (e.g. ""fine eyes,"" ""You must allow me to tell you how much I ardently love and admire you"") for their own. The language is very modern and often very corny. The end scene is almost embarrassing to watch, I actually felt bad for the actors having to spew that nonsense(Then I remembered what they were being paid TO say that). When they attempt Regency-era speech is laughable at best, painful at worst.The historical inaccuracies are glaringly bad and almost. For one, the clothing. While sleeveless gowns were all the rage during the Regency period, wearing something that very much resembles a slip was not. Caroline Bingley would most likely be banished from good society forever if she chose to wear the dress, if it may be called that, at the Meryton Assembly.The Bennet girls always appeared much too ragged for Regency middle-class women. This is not the 21st century where you roll out of bed, take a quick shower and rush out. No, a girl had at least one maid working on her appearance for at least an hour and a half every morning.Then again, the directors would have you believe that the Bennets are the 19th century equivalent of the Jodes. They are not so. Mr. Bennet is a middle-class gentleman farmer with an estate, which means he is not badly off. His main problem lies that with five daughter, he cannot generate a large dowry for any of them. Not the wealthiest of people, but the Bennets would not have a pig wandering through their house.Meanwhile, Darcy is apparently managed to secure the dukedom of Derbyshire for himself and issued some marble statues. WHEN A PORTRAIT WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE! Completely unnecessary.As a Jane-Austen adaption it is entirely off. It has none of Austen's charm and wit. In fact, it completely loses the satirical edge which Austen included in all her novels. It degrades into something dangerously resembling a Barbara Cartland-style bodice ripper novel than a Jane Austen.So, as a movie,  it's alright for a rainy day or when one is in desperate need for a chick flick. As an adaption of what is considered one of the most important novels in the history of female literature, do not get your hopes to high. If you're watching this to avoid reading the novel for a lit. class assignment, may I recommend the Wishbone version?"	2.0	I'd watch the Wishbone version, if I were you.	2006-04-22	32	19	13

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A36URDTDOMMB2L	AnnieK	I have not seen the A&E; version of P and P, but I have read the book, and I love the book!  That being said, I know that some things have to be changed or rearranged, but for me this missed the special feel, the spirit, if you will, of the book.I didn't care for most of the casting choices, but I'm not sure if that dislike was added to by the poor script.  The lead, Knightly, seemed very shallow and as others have said, did a lot of grinning and snarling.  I found it very distracting, almost like she was trying too hard.  She was also making googly eyes at Darcy very early on.  This was an odd choice.  Part of the point of the whole thing was her dislike, almost disgust really, for Darcy.  I'm not sure what they were trying to do with making her eyeing him like that.  I never got the idea she disliked him, so that was a big failing.  She wasn't really much different than her younger sisters.  Her character was the most disappointing for me.  Caroline Bingley was uninspired, and looked like she was wearing her undies or a nightgown during the ball.  Bingley was just silly, Darcy was just boring, and Collins wasn't really that bad and not nearly as irritating as he should be.  The characters in the book are quirky and wonderful, all with depth and layers totally overlooked for this movie.I won't mention some of the other things people have complained about, though I do agree with some of them.  The biggest problem I have with this movie, not even considering the above, it that it bored me.  It was all I could do to sit and watch it.  It was very dull.  That is why I can't understand why they changed so much.  Thankfully I had snacks to occupy me or I would have just turned it off.  I didn't see any magic in it, nothing that made my heart flutter.  I guess I will try the A&E; version and hope that it is better.  Thankfully I got this from the library, so I am not out anything.  I am going to buy one when I find one I enjoy, and I hope I do.	1.0	"Boring, and for me missed the ""spirit"" of Pride and Prejudice"	2012-06-06	11	6	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2V7HP8G39HKRV	Anonymous	I found this adaptation to race along from beginning to end, and in the process I believe it sacraficed some much-needed build-up that we find in the BBC/A&E version. We don't get a sense of the time that has passed during which characters are ruminating on what is happening and their feelings about it. We just get scene by scene thrown at us and we are expected to be carried along and believe it. The cinematography is excellent in many parts. The acting is good, but Keira Knightly always has that smirk on her face and after awhile I wonder why it is there so much. Although she holds her own, I was not always drawn in to her performance...or I was drawn in but wasn't sure what I found there. This definitely had a more romantic and sensual feel that other versions have not. I do wish there had been more build-up of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy that would make their falling in love more believable. I always feel that on Darcy's part there is not enough conveyance of what he is attracted to when he is attracted to justify the passion in the end. I did find Mrs. Bennet to be far less shrill and irritating than in other adaptations which was a big plus. I also liked the character of Charlotte here very well. All of the laughing and giggling at the Bennet house was a bit over the top.	4.0	Fast but still hits the spot	2006-08-24	2	1	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ATDWGT7ML6610	anonymous	This movie does not stick perfectly to the book. It is more like Pride and Prejudice as our imagination might see if someone was telling it to us. Or like the scenes we've all changed in our minds eye to how we would like them to look, or scenes we've added. Many things are changed slightly. Characters personalities, with the exception of Lizzie and Darcy, are more what you would expect to find in real life. Mrs. Bennet claims more of our sympthy. Mr. Bennet seems more of an eccentric old man who loves his family but greatly values peace. Everyone else does not seems so whole bad or good, and I've never felt so bad for Darcy from the book or any movie.It's a short. Only two hours and nine minutes. It seems a little rushed at first, but everytime you watch it seems less so. It only gets four star because of this. The time also made it hard for the characters to really be delved into, but still very nice movie.	4.0	Impressionist Movie	2006-03-06	12	9	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A26OR9VFY3J8CT	"Anthony Marray ""amarrayw"""	"I've watched this movie three times. I've read the novel twice and seen the A&E; version (which this film is unfairly compared with). Therefore I am fully aware of the story and characters and all that diddle-dee-do. So I guess I can be considered informed of the material and what it is about.Now I should mention to people who have this idea that movies based on books should remain faithful to the point of thinking the source as sacred text: the screenwriter did take liberties with the story. A leap in time here. A missing episode there. A sudden visit here. And a hussy fit there.But it is an ""adaptation"" and not a ""translation"" of the original novel by dear Miss Austen. The changes are not drastically uncalled for. They are actually refreshing. As is the mood that the director (Wright) set for the film. The film moves at a swift pace but the mood is always down-to-earth and emotionally focused. Normally when people do Austen adaptations they have this image of the whole movie being focused around drawing rooms with the etiquettes associated with the Regency period. They put so much emphasis into the details of the setting and situations that they neglect the characters humanity and hope that the actors are up to code. This version actually looked at the material in the opposite direction and focused more on the main characters (especially Elizabeth or ""Lizzy"" as she is well known).Oh well I must talk about the acting. It was good.For more info notice the academy award nomination Keira Knightley received for her portrayal of Lizzy. Even though the Academy Awards relativity to cinematic excellence has lessened, please be assured that the notice placed towards Ms. Knightley's performance was well deserved. The whole cast was pretty good with the other standout being Donald Sutherland. But if I must say something more about Ms. Knightley, it is that she fitted who Elizabeth was as a young opinionated woman. She plays Lizzy with the conviction that I felt was missing in other P&P; adaptations. It one thing to say the lines, it's another to say the lines like it's something you would actually say.This movie puts the ""passion"" aspect into the romance of Austen's creation. A true Romantic (of the literary kind) would think of this adaptation as a triumph. And if dear Miss Austen were alive she would probably giggle (of the hushed kind) with delight at the unabashed joy this movies gives in spades.Well RecommendedNote: For the strict Austen fans who believe that Austen would spin in her grave at the supposed blasphemy of the movie, I will say this. You forget that Miss Austen (the writer of gothic-satire Northanger Abbey) probably did not think so much of herself that she wouldn't have wanted other people to look at her work in different ways. Stop being narrow-minded. Miss Austen wasn't! Now enjoy the movie.(Off the soap box)"	5.0	Excellent!	2006-06-08	12	6	6

Countryside was captured with extreme authenticity and delicacy!I was stuned by this wonderful adaption of the Jane Austen novel. With a spontaneous direction from Joe Wright, Pride & Prejudice leaves you happy!Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland are wonderfully casted for this brilliant romance. Also Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench portrayed extremelly well their charachters. Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy and Jena Malone as Lydia, Elizabeth's younger sister, are also good. I must say that they all portrayed their charachters with gusto!Dario Marianelli creates a wonderful score wich fits with the rural England scenario. I think - that is my opinion - Dario found a great inspiration on the famous Virginia Astley's 'From Gardens Where We Feel Secure' CD.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AQ3IEMTMCVZ02	Anzinga	It would have been nice to have been able to give this half a star becasue that is about all this movie deserves and that was for a scene and a half: the proposal in the rain - the rain was a nice touch, and the last tender scene between husband and wife.A worse adaptation could not have been made.  By the time they reached the first ball - 5 minutes into the movie, I was sick.Keira Knightly as Elizabeth. She made Elizabeth into a giggly, silly girl who Darcy would never have fallen in love with.  All the gilrs looked greasy, unkempt, and illiterate.  i cannot believe the behavior.  Particularly when Elizabeth comes to Netherfield after hearing that Jane is sick, she just walks in the door, looks at everyone and then walks out like a petulant child.  Elizabeth Bennet would never have behaved like that, maybe Lydia.Matthew Macfayden as Darcy.  Well at least he looks the part better than Colin Firth did seeing as how Darcy was only 26.The dialogue and the story is stilted because its been chopped up. Unless you've read the book you won't know what they're talking about half the time. They talk about Darcy breaking up Jane and Bingley and yet all they show is the two of them dancing once, never more.And Wickham?  you never truly get the essence of his evil.I have to say Donald Sutherland as a loving husband to Mrs Bennet, just turned my stomach.  Where was the sarcasm, where was the dry wit, where was the disdain?I have seen Brenda Blethyn in many movies and she is just way too nice to be Mrs Bennet.Georgiana Darcy is so forward. In the book, she is so shy she can barely say two words together.All the girls are way too thin.  That style of dress was designed to show off your bosom. Keira Knightley has the chest of a 12 year old and the dress does not help one bit.  you could see that none of the girls were wearing corsets.  It would have helped.Don't waste a penny to see this movie.  if you get to see it free, go for it.  At least you'll have a good time seeing all the things that were done wrong.	1.0	Less than one star	2006-05-02	58	27	31

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A23KZBVCFKW1XS	A_Plain_Janeite	"When I first heard there was going to be another version, my first thoughts were that nothing could top the BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle!  Especially since that one was 5 hrs., and followed the book to the tee!Well, of course the new one was cut down to a measly 2 hrs.!!  Because of the time constraint- they had to rush the story along, almost at a fast-forward pace (or as someone aptly put it: ""didn't allow the story to breathe"").  Surprisingly, I didn't find it that big of an issue.There were a few notable changes however... *SPOILER* First, the part where Mr. Darcy first proclaims his love to Elizabeth is a bit different than it was in the book (the setting that is).  Second, the confrontation between Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lizzy is customized (for the sake of time).  Also, (towards the end) the part where Elizabeth confesses her changed feelings towards Mr. Darcy is different than in the book; and the end was also tweaked a bit.Despite these changes, I think the original story was still able to shine through!For the most part I was pleased with their choice of actors.  Dame Judi Dench was a perfect Lady Catherine; and I really enjoyed Rosamond Pike (as Jane), possibly even more-so than the actress in the '95 version.  Mr. Bingly, a tad naive and silly at times is nonetheless endearing!However, Keira Knightley just isn't selling Elizabeth for me (as Jennifer Ehle did).  I don't sense much emotional depth, or connection in and to her character.  KK's roles- at least the ones I've seen her in- all seem to blend together.As for Matthew Macfadyen, my only experience of him prior to this, was a smaller role in the miniseries based on Anthony Trollope's ""The Way We Live Now"".Instead of coming off quite as cold and haughty as CF's Darcy; Matthew's portrayal gave a somewhat new dimension to this enigmatic character!  He really did a fine job in showcasing the more introverted/introspective side of Fitzwilliam (possibly an INTJ temperament). And truth be told, it was a little too easy to get lost in his ""fine eyes""!  Needless to say, he is now my second favorite ""Mr. Darcy""!  (If you haven't already, check him out in the latest BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens ""Little Dorrit"" - he's absolutely brilliant in his role as ""Arthur Clennam""!)All in all it's a good movie- especially for those who don't have the patience to sit through the 5 hr. one.I'm also really pleased with the ""special edition""!  While there's not a whole lot more DVD extras than on the original; the added book, and soundtrack make the purchase worthwhile!**Last edited 2013**"	4.0	(3.75 Stars) Pride & Prejudice: Revisited & Revised!	2009-01-07	2	1	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2U549OUP6XJ1B	"April79marie ""April79marie"""	I simply love this movie. I also like the BBC version with Colin Firth and J.Ehle but honestly this version is my favourite. Although the adaptation of the novel is not really faithful to the novel(unlike the BBC one) I think that Joe Wright, the director, still did an amazing job by making a two-hour movie with all the major passages of the book. The first thing I noticed about this movie is the unique, wonderful atmosphere that the director and his assistants managed to create, with a beautiful-yet-down-to-earth setting, the movement of the camera (I was impressed by the way the camera moves, turns or follows the characters through the ballroom at Netherfield) the long shots mingling with close-views of the actors. Even the sounds are perfect -you can hear birds singing in the morning, rain pattering down- and just for that, the movie is a pure joy for me because it feels somewhat real. The atmosphere in the Bennett's house is so familiar and pleasant that you feel almost immediately a connection with this family. I just love every moment of the movie, I love the dialogues even if they don't correspond to the ones in the book (the Darcy's proposal is a moment of anthology! as this `lovers' spat'- kind of argument between Darcy and Lizzie gets more and more intense) The pace of the movie is fast, the good thing is that you don't have time to get bored, there is always something going on in every scene, the bad thing is that there are not enough scenes with these wonderful characters and I don't want the movie to end!!!Right from the start, you feel so close to the characters that you don't want to leave them. They seem so alive (Lizzie Bennet has never been so flamboyant!)I couldn't help feeling as emotionally charged as them. All the actors are great, not only the leading ones but also the minor ones: the younger Bennet sisters -Jena Malone is so funny-and R. Pike is perfect as serene, beautiful Jane -.It is a pity though that we don't see some characters like Caroline Bingley or Charles Bingley or Wickham very often.And of course Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen are really perfect for me as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy. Keira Knightley gives energy and a mix of wit and mischievousness to the heroine. MacFadyen's Darcy is different from the book, I grant you, but this shy, love-struck and vulnerable is simply irresistible!! OK, maybe you don't have Colin Firth's wet shirt but you can still see MacFadyen drenched to the skin at one point while he is proposing to Lizzie and he is downright sexy too. Plus, his deep voice gives me the shivers! Knightley and Macfadyen have powerful chemistry, and when Darcy proposes to Lizzie in the rain, you can feel the heat, the passion growing more intense between them. The long stares between them, the way they passionately spar and their near-kisses are so sexually charged that they make me almost swoon with delight. One particular moment that I like too is when he helps her getting into a carriage and by doing so, he touches her hand. This is such a magical moment because it is not something you would do at the time especially when you've just met. And the climactic scene , oh boy, this scene in which Macfadyen appears in the misty dawn, desperately seeking Lizzie is so beautiful and rich with sensuality that it always makes me sigh just as it does Lizzie. At that point, I always feel the urge to tell Lizzie that she would be crazy to say 'no' to him now! I think that for once there is the perfect combination between Lizzie and Darcy: (They are both young), he is shy, reserved and socially ill-at-ease while she is free-spirited, flamboyant, lively, always speaking a mind of her own, and so they seem to complete each other very well.The DVD, the English version,is worth the money because the special features are very interesting and ...there is also THE ALTERNATE US ENDING with the balcony kiss. About this US ending, I still think that they could have made a better scene although it is downright sweet. I can feel that Wright wasn't a 100% behind this last conversation between Lizzie and Darcy. Not that I am really complaining, it is still very nice to see them together one last time. One regret, where are the cut-off scenes? I am probably asking too much since the DVD features are already excellent but I 'd love to see the deleted scenes. And I am sure that Joe Wright must have deleted some scenes... Let's hope that there will be one day a special edition with two DVDs. This 'Pride&Prejudice;'movie has become one of my favourites (I think that I must have seen it 4 times in the movie theater before buying the DVD.)I am definitely a big fan because not only I have the book and the music but I 've also been to England just to visit Chatsworth/Pemberley,the Peak District and Burgley House/Lady Catherine De Bourgh's house!!!	5.0	This movie has bewitched me body& soul!	2006-04-29	29	21	8

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A107VOOJJMPYQG	Arden Carlson	To begin the movie with sensual and swelling music that makes your heart sinks at the sound of it, kept all of us on the edge of our seats for the whole time we were in the theater. I never thought it could happen; another adaptation that tops A&E;'s Pride and Prejudice and here it is! Though, there aren't as many words spoken within some scenes, but just by looking at the emotions spreading through the characters' faces and listening to that music was just enough!The filmmakers didn't go overboard with any effects that would break away from the true focal points of the movie. There were a few dramatic shots, but it was for the good of the movie; we all can understand that. Just let the music and actors do their job of equaling it out. What I loved the most was how they've paid attention to the little details that just makes a difference in a shot: how they've kept capturing Macfadyen (Darcy) from a far angle, watching Lizzy; the servants and farm animals in the background; and the differentiation behind the make up and hair in each scenes to say that: Lizzy Bennett did love to walk.Keira Knightley is a lovely actress who played her role magnificently, but to my idea, she could have been a little more into her character instead of letting the cameras do all of the work; nonetheless, she'd played well enough to convince us that she WAS a worthy Lizzy Bennett.Matthew Macfadyen gave me second thoughts about Colin Firth, who was my favorite Darcy, until now. Macfadyen is a charming actor (not to mention, a heartthrob, for some of the girls) on screen; who made the situation even worst by playing the tall, dark, handsome, and mysterious, Mr. Darcy. I was blown away by his talent of being so much in character that I WAS convinced that he WAS Mr. Darcy. When he proposed for the first time to Lizzy Bennett (Knightley) nearly everyone in the theater gasped; not only for his confession, but how he had said it. Now, at this point, I was falling out of my seat.Those two, with the combination of the brilliant casting made the movie complete.You don't need to read the book to understand what the heck is going on; you don't need to know every details of the characters' life to like it; and you don't need to worry about any details to look for. Just enjoy this movie, for it will lift you away, keep you at the edge of your seats and your hearts will never cease to stop fluttering until two hours after the movie. Definitely a must see!	4.0	Can it get any better?	2005-12-09	11	10	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3C89AQMRN3YW5	a reader	"Upon first viewing of the film, I thought the scenery was lovely and the soundtrack was amazing.  Jean-Yves makes us all wish we had practiced the piano like our parents advised.  The problem I had with the film was the complete lack of subtlety.  For instance, the Bennets are uber-rural in this version.  I didn't need to see a parading pig's backside and undercarriage to get that.  Little things, like the clap of thunder when Darcy oversteps his critique of the Bennets by adding Lizzie's dad into the mix, were like unnecessary punctuation marks. Talk all you want about Mrs. Bennet and the three younger sisters, but face the wrath of mother nature when you diss a girl's dad.  Other annoyances: Lizzie must be as free as the blackbird, who's forever warbling in the distance.  She's dark and mysterious and wild, with plenty of dark frocks and contoured eye makeup.  Got it.  Didn't need the constant face time that was spent zooming in on Keira Knightley's dark eyes and pursed lips.  Don't even get me started with the obsessive attention to her jawline.  And Mr. Darcy is more s-s-s-socially in-n-n-ept as opposed to morally superior in this current release.  Matthew Macfayden excels at dark, dishy, and intense.  He didn't need to stumble on his words to emphasize Darcy's vulnerabilities or to make us like Darcy more.  Darcy is supposed to be a pompous jerk, who is seldom checked by others and changes only when he meets his match in Elizabeth.  So much of this film feels spoon fed and dumbed down.  I wish I could get past these things to enjoy the lovely locations and the superb acting.  However, the ending was so silly, with its paperback, bodice-ripper vibe, that it cannot be ignored.  The ""swans at night"" made me think of that beer commercial that spoofs the old chocolate ad, you know the one with guy sampling the foam off the woman's face?.  The actors seemed to struggle to get through the ending without laughing at the absurdity of what they were saying.  That should won them an award.  ""Goddess divine""?  ""My pearl""?  Blech!  To tack that on was poor judgment, even if it were to appease the American audience.  I recommend stopping the film before you get to this part.  If you're better at overlooking these flaws, then you will enjoy the other parts of the film.  If anything, it ill make you want to take up the piano forte."	4.0	Subtle as a kick in the teeth	2006-03-16	21	10	11

Instead they choose to botch it up as badly as they can.Kiera Knightley's Lizzy:  Not the respectable Elizabeth Bennet who has for the longest time been my favorite heroine of literature.  She giggles, and lets her chin, collarbone and lips do most of the work.In the marriage proposal which takes place in the rain, (for heightened dramatics I suppose), Mr Darcy defends himself on the spot, rather than saving that dialog for the letter he is supposed to write to her.  After his explanation, Elizabeth goes towards him and nearly kisses him, and the whole time she looks like she is fighting the urge to drag him to bed then and there.When Lydia takes off with Mr Wickham, its effect on the Bennet family is seen as but a minor inconvenience rather than the disgrace it threatens to be in the book.And in the final scene, when Elizabeth is explaining to her father that she does indeed love mr Darcy, she spills the beans about everything he did for her family rather than keep it discreet.And I search in vain in Jane Austen's book for the part where Elizabeth asks Mr Darcy to call her his ""goddess""."	1.0	Call me ....

In my opinion the best adaptation of P&P; is so far the 1995 BBC version with Colin Firth and Jenifer Ehle, however the most accurate to the book is the 1980 version with David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvie.Perhaps the thing that I disliked the most about this movie was the fact that they made Mr. Bingley look so goofy, almost like an idiot, and Mr. Darcy was to shy. He did not had the dominant masculine strength that I found so appealing in P&P.; I watch just about every adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and it took me a while to warm up to the 2005 version, but after several times watching the movie I learn to enjoy it. I think this adaptation appeals more to the younger generation. Even thought the characters were not very accurate to the book, they all had a charm of their own. My favorite character was Rosamund Pike, she was by far the best Jane Bennet.This was a more modern adaptation of P&P;, where the strict rules of the time were not follow as they have should. The fashion was a little bit to sloppy for me, it did not had the clean and tidy look as I would want to see. Usually when I see a modern adaptation of an period novel, I prefer to see it ""separated"" from the novel, even when it has the same story line and the same characters. I like to see it with it's own independence, like: ""Bridget Jones Diary"" or ""Bride and Prejudice"" or a more funny adaptation, like ""Lost in Austen"", but when they put that modern feel to the ""period"" it makes me feel like they have butchered the book.With all this said, I still enjoyed the movie (eventually), and I'm sure the 2005 version with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen inspire the love, and curiosity for Jane Austen novels to many of the younger generation, who perhaps before were looking at Jane Austen as nothing more than just another high school boring assignment."	3.0	This version is more appealing to the younger generation	2006-03-22	30	16	14

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2E21DAQ7ZKBUJ	"AR ""Regencyreader"""	"This is a wonderfully condensed adaptation of the book (which I've read).  I've also recently seen the BBC version of P&P; and though I did enjoy the five hour version, I believe this two hour version tells the gist of the story very well.  Keira Knightly is a bit ""cuter"" than the book describes Lizzy, but she does an excellent job of being feisty and strong-willed.  Matthew McFayden is a brooding Darcy and portrays the character very well.In this movie version, I believe there are a few scenes that are very touching and set it apart from the miniseries.  The first is when Darcy assists Lizzy into the carriage when she and Jane are leaving Netherfield.  It's as if Lizzie and Darcy immediately feel a spark when their hands touch and when Darcy walks away and has to flex his hand from the touch - wow, it's great.Also, when he proposes to her in the rain and she rejects him.  Before he leaves, he looks at her and his eyes reflect the pain, hurt and anger that he's feeling and he burns a stare right at her for a split second, as he turns to leave, it's heart wrenching.The one scene I definitely enjoyed more than the miniseries (and the book for that matter) was the ending.  I found it very touching and preferred it to the miniseries.  In the miniseries, yes, they kiss at the end, but it's almost casual, there's no spark.  In this version, they playfully caress each other, as Lizzie is suggesting terms of endearment, that Darcy can refer to her.  I was happy with the ending."	5.0	Well worth watching	2006-01-19	13	10	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3OR9X4XEUJ32I	A Satisfied Viewer	"I have a great love of Jane Austen and especially Pride and Prejudice, but I don't like this adaptation. For me, it is simply far too rushed and incomplete to do justice to the great novel. To draw audiences into the wonderful romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, a film has to be well-paced to allow for their character development and their witty bantering, to draw you into their love story, and to see the changes that take place as the two of them recognize their own shortcomings. I just didn't think this film succeeded in that way, so it didn't move me romantically. Plus, the actors spoke so softly and muffled it was almost impossible to understand them, and the whole film came across as dark in color, rather than the brightness and beauty that I associate with Austen.I didn't think this film truly captured the wit and humor or told the story fully enough. The pacing was bizarre, and I wouldn't have even been able to really follow it or ""get"" the storyline at all if I hadn't already known it well before I watched this movie.I  must admit: Although I've since read and loved the book, I was first introduced to Pride and Prejudice through the incredible 1995 BBC/A&E; miniseries (with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle) when it was first shown  here in the U.S. I absolutely fell in love with it. That adaptation is a complete delight, and it faithfully portrays the novel in so much depth, that it possibly affected how I looked at this version. On the other hand, if I had seen only THIS movie as my P&P; introduction, I probably would never have even wanted to read the book. It's certainly possible to love more than one adaptation of a book, which I do with Little Women and some others; I'm not usually a ""purist"" about these kinds of things. But this is how I feel about this particular movie. It just didn't work for me at all."	2.0	Too Rushed to Do Jane Austen Justice	2008-04-03	11	6	5

The cinematography and performances are excellent, and the details regarding life in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (manor houses with peeling paint and dirty floors, muddy yards with pigs and chickens about, etc.) give the film a realistic dimension.However, because this is a feature film, it, by necessity, omits much of the story and nuance of the execptional BBC version.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AFDYHKAH8AJDT	A. Sloan	I somehow didn't feel the magic and electricity that I got from the 1995 mini series and Sense and Sensibility; which is a shame because I was all ready to adore this one too.  The reason I loved the mini series is because there was no stone unturned; every nuance of emotion was true to Austen's book. Even the narrations as Elizabeth read the letters. Too much goes on to gloss over the things that make you fall in love with the story.  There is no possible way to get the complete feel of the novel unless you have the time to do so.  Much like the Lonesome Dove mini series.  Although totally different genres, the characters felt real and were full-bodied.  The book had a light air to it much like the novel and the movie/novel Sense and Sensibility although both had their sad moments but I can't say this movie did that for me.The only characters that I thought did complete justice to the novel and the mini series were that of Dame Dench's de Bourgh and Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins. I connected also from time to time with Knightly's rendition of  Elizabeth particularly when she overheard Darcy's opinion of her at the dance. Yet Blethens and Sutherland both of whose acting I adore just missed (more so Donald Sutherland) I don't blame the actors for this, mostly the director.  (I especially didn't care to Jena Malone's rendition of Lydia, which was slyer than it was totally oblivious, immature and childlike).  I just feel that this is such a beloved and full novel that leaving the small things that make it so wonderful isn't as satisfyingI'm far from a novel purist but you just miss so much if all of it isn't shown.  If only Hollywood was brave enough to gamble on making something that length, this may have worked better for me.  But we know that will never happen.  I found it somewhat lacking and far from the BBC mini series caliber.  Maybe the extraordinary classics should all be mini-series.  For those who think this is good.... take some time over a weekend to see the mini series with an open mind.  You'll be hooked!	2.0	Not enough character development for me.	2006-04-24	22	13	9

NO COLIN FIRTH !This movie is really splendid visually, and very great acting by all the cast; I think if I'd never seen Colin Firth as Darcy, I'd never be in a position to compare or miss something/someone in this movie... But unfortunately, once you've seen Darcy played by Colin, you just can't help it !Maybe someone could tell me if the part in this movie was ever even proposed to him????Apart from all that, I find the movie is of course SUPERIOUR in every way to the BBC mini-series, not only visually, but in the choice of actors, apart from Colin Firth of course ! hehe...The performances are much more ""natural"" and subtle, and it's filmed in such a vivacious and beautifully romantic way, that you won't find it hard to be swept away...Even though I've never thought Keira Knightley to be good enough for such a part, I was very pleased, and even Darcy is good, if you don't keep reminding yourself about Colin Firth !

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AGT9G5EOQNW7A	A Truly Hopeless Romantic	This version has beautiful scenery, costumes, actors and has great film quality! The acting is marvelous. Mr. Dacy does such a wonderful job being tormented inside and portraying that torment without a word, only showing it in his guarded expressions. Lizzie and Jane are both beautiful and great actresses. Mr. Bingly is a bit overly enthusiastic and air headed, but pleasing. It had the potential to be a great version of Pride and Prejudice.....but it wasn't!I was confused most of the time and at the end felt like I was rushed through a beautiful love story. I have been a fan of Pride and Prejudice ever since watching the 1996 version starring Colin Firth and have since watched it so many times I have it memorized! Perhaps that is the problem. The 1996 version was a wonderful story. I always knew what each character was feeling and what was going on. There were no gaps in the story and I fell in love with it. I was excited to learn there was an updated version being released this year because I hoped for a better film quality than the 1996 one. It at least had that much going for it. It was a beautiful picture but with a hurried story. They should have lengthened the film so the viewer knew all the characters and details of the story. Instead the movie felt rushed, like a summary to the real thing. A good movie, perhaps if you haven't watched the 1996 version already, but I strongly suggest you only rent this one and then buy the other =-).	2.0	It had the potential to be great....but what happened??!!!!	2006-05-19	16	8	8
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3W38ZRBHIAW7O	Atticus Finch, Brooklyn	"I was looking forward to this version of my favorite novel because I wanted to see how they would slice it down to two hours runtime.  I was delighted with some of it.  Miss Knightley's performance is quite good and she seems to possess all the fire of Elizabeth Bennet.  Brenda Blethyn and Dame Judy Dench (perfection itself) were also standouts, although Miss Dench's important final scene with Miss Knightley was abridged.  And why does she mention a pretty sort of garden (taken from the novel), when they play this scene inside the house at night?I found quite a few more flaws in the production.  The best dialogue is taken directly from the book.  When Miss Austen speaks, the film and the actors are just fine.  When the dialogue is newly invented, it doesn't seem to fly along.  I found Matthew McFadyen rather wooden and not as attractive as the characters say Mr. Darcy is.  Also, the family relationships are not correctly delineated as Miss Austen wrote them.  In the novel, Mr. Bennet favors Elizabeth for her wit.  Of all his daughters, she is the only one, he confides in the book, that he can converse with on an intelligent level.  Also, Lydia (in the novel) is an exact replica of her mother -- which is not apparent in this film.  Also, Mrs. Bennet favors Lydia above her other daughters in the book.  This is nowhere apparent in the film.  It seems that the daughters are all lumped together as one by their parents.  Mr. Bennet's financial concerns are barely brought to light and Lydia's scandalous elopement with Wycham, which is so important to the denoument, is reduced to little more than a trifling matter and is over with in less than three to four minutes.  The ending is like a fast-forward (obviously they were running out of time), and we get a tacked on coda that has Darcy and Elizabeth at Pemberley in a love scene.  Miss Austen's ""psychology"" is missing nearly throughout this film.The DVD supplies us with the actors being interviewed as well as screenwriter and director, and here is where we find where they went wrong.  It seems that all of the information they are giving us is not at all what Miss Austen intended.  Donald Sutherland himself (Mr. Bennet), constantly speaks of how much his character loves his daughters.  Maybe he should try re-reading the book.  Mr. Bennet spent nearly all his time in his library wishing to be undisturbed by the noise of his wife and the household in general.I am forever grateful to the BBC for having taken the novel, one of the finest in the English language, and giving it the royal treatment in 1995 with superlative actors and a screenwriter who knew how to aptly recreate Miss Austen's world.  How fastidious they were with every detail and Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth seem to be the quintessential leading players in this beautiful production.  We have it for as long as DVDs and film last.This new production, even though it is sliced down, seems slow, oddly enough, and I could not wait for it to be over.  I look forward to sitting down with the 1995 version soon."	2.0	When it's Austen talking, it comes alive.	2006-07-11	17	10	7

However, being that it is a 5- hour long drama, it's not one that you can pop into the DVD player and watch just any time.  So, naturally, when I discovered that a shorter, newer film was being made I was very excited. I felt  Sense & Sensibility came off wonderfully in Hollywood, so I was very keen to see how the most beloved of Austen's novels would rate.I must admit I was sorely disappointed.  I felt that Darcy was portrayed as more shy than proud and Elizabeth more of a sass than a quick wit.  In the book and in the A&E; version, Elizabeth's role as her father's favorite makes her charcter more of an intellectual than her sisters.  In this new movie, Elizabeth doesn't have much of a connection with her father - and comes off as silly as the rest of her sisters (although a little more outspoken).  I also couldn't get past the squalor in which the Bennett family was living or the costuming for that matter.  The Bennetts looked like the dirtiest family I had ever seen and I couldn't imagine how Mr. Darcy (in all of his pride) could fall in love with Elizabeth.  (To those of you who could get past this, I commend you.)  While in the A&E; version, the Bennetts certainly aren't as rich as the Bingley's or the Darcy's but they are a respectable family and CLEAN.  The viewers also see the subtle transformation of a proud Darcy to one that is strugglling with his feelings for Elizabeth, and then finally to the great hero that he becomes in the end.I understand that with time restrictions such transformations are not always possible and so I give this movie credit for the effort.  Matthew Macfadyen was a good Darcy, but when compared to Colin Firth - there is no contest.  I thought that Judi Dench gave a marvelous performance as Lady Catherine and I liked this movie's version of Mr. Collins a smidge more than the A&E; version (it may be that he is more attractive than the other one.)  When it comes to Elizabeth - Jennifer Ehle owns the part.  Her performance seemed to have jumped right off the pages of the book.  I know that this new movie should stand alone and shouldn't be compared to a longer, more accurate adaption of the book - but it's very difficult not to compare the two. So I must state that this new film, while good in capturing the basics of the story, left much to be desired in everything else."	2.0	Pales in Comparison	2006-04-05	32	15	17

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1R602SXNGOMJ4	A. Vegan	"Firstly, if you have already seen the Pride and Prejudice miniseries with Colin Firth, don't expect too much from this movie or you will be disappointed, as I was.It seemed that the dialogue was ""dumbed down"" for the general audience.This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed and if Jane Austen were alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy.  If one is making a period movie, one must be true to the period. The best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the English countryside.I guess the main flaw of this new version is Darcy himself, a role played by Matthew MacFadyen. In the story he is rather dull and generally uninterested in what's going on. It must be difficult to replace Colin Firth as leading man and the Darcy of the miniseries of course had more screen time to show his inner struggle. But the new Darcy is so dull that frankly you don't care if he ends up winning Elizabeth's heart or not. There is absolutely no spark between Knightly and MacFadyen. At the end of the move they don't even kiss and as an audience you couldn't care less.I don't recommend this movie to anyone.  Go rent the miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle if you want a real Jane Austen story."	3.0	Tripe	2006-08-03	13	6	7

And no, MacFaydan is not Firth, and Knightly is not Ehle. And some liberties were taken with the original storyline (sometimes a bit disconcerting like Lady Catherine's night time visit?? and Bingley entering Jane's sickroom, even before knocking?? ""simply not done"" in those days!).But I very much agree with the positive reviewers below --this version is MOST enjoyable on its own. The scenery, photography, and music are gorgeous (you must buy the CD!). Darcy and Elizabeth are still wonderfully Darcy and Elizabeth. It was a little disconcerting at first to see so much mud, livestock, and plain gowns--but you get past that fairly quickly. And it seems maybe a bit more realistic for country gentry.BTW--if you're a P&P; addict like me, don't miss Pamela Aiden's Darcy trilogy--it tells the entire story from Darcy's viewpoint and fills in a lot of what I think is missing. Also, if you have wondered what might have happened after the wedding and like a ""spicier"" novel, read Linda Berdoll's ""Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife"" (Austen meets Bronte and Sandra Brown)."	5.0	Enjoy for what it is--not Firth but wonderful!	2006-01-13	311	259	52
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2CHCUQHK73FR2	"A. Whipp ""amw"""	Well, first, I must identify myself as a Colin Firth/BBC version fan. That is the best adaptation of P&P.; For a two hour version though this version can grab readers and non-readers alike. It is well done in terms of scenery and casting. It also has the necessary butterfly-in-the-stomach moments that make it a good romance whether or not you have read the book.I did however, not need to see the last scene after they are already married. I thought it was the definite sign of a Hollywood movie trying to be everything to everyone. I didn't need it and I am a huge romance movie fan. After such a beautiful walk in the fog, the last scene seemed too out of place and cheesy/embarrassing.Another complaint is that people who have not read the book might be confused by some people's relationships or personalities because there simply isn't enough time to flush all this out. Bottom line, true P&P; fans will notice some glaring issues, but everyone can find something in this movie that is worth the watch. I had to own it, as a companion for the ultimate BBC version (please watch it if you like this movie).	3.0	Good Hollywood 2 hour version	2006-06-07	6	4	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AYWTYI18LQ2EW	A. Winters	The first time I saw this version, I really did not like it at all.  My biggest complaint is the pace.  The dialogue is usually rushed, yet so much time is taken to show Lizzy twirling in a swing.  If you don't know the scene by heart already, you will need to replay the first proposal repeatedly before you catch all of the dialogue.Knightley just can't compare to Ehle.  She doesn't convey the intelligence that appealed to Darcy, the wit and attitude yes, but not the book-reading.  While the mother is less annoying than the 95 version, most of the family appears slothful and careless in this film.  Can you really imagine Darcy visiting a home with paint peeling and pigs traipsing?  While this Whickham has it in looks, his acting was lacking.  Definitely splashed with too many improprieties.  I also recommend turning it off before you get to the sappy balcony scene ending.With all that said, it is still a beautiful, entertaining, standard-length film.  What it lacks in Austen authenticity, it makes up for in cinematography and a memorable score.  (My hubby brought home a copy and we regularly watch it.)  Just keep in mind that this is a whole different feel to the brilliant favorite, 95 Firth/Ehle version.	3.0	Entertaining, but not true to Austen	2011-12-29	3	2	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A27NPY9CPM0OQX	Aya	For those of you who are avid Jane Austen fans, this a is a refreshing recent adaptation of the novel. I would recommend anyone who owns the A&E version to also buy this one, as it offers a different take, but one that is equal in value and quality. Also, this one is several hours shorter, so it offers the same great punch in a smaller dose. The actors do a fabulous job, and the cinematography is breathtaking.	5.0	FANTASTIC	2008-03-05	8	5	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2GJJFVISJ2XPA	A. Zinner	"The acting in this version is wonderful and spot on. To begin  Jane and Mr Bingley are a perfect fit for their characters and each other. Both actors show a goodness and quietness in their manners so that one has trouble imagining them together and the issues that this couple faces along the way. The biggest issue no doubt is sharing their heartfelt emotions and love for each other.Elizabeth and Mr Darcy are also a perfect match. Elizabeth is just the right amount of independence and vulnerability that her character comes alive. Elizabeth shows that she is sensitive to others opinions, as when Darcy comments on her appearance and behavior at village dance, after his cutting comments she seeks out her best friend to help confirm her beliefs that he is wrong and has a great prejudice. She assumes and exhibits an attitude that she has everything figured out and as a result judges things much to quickly - including Darcy. The development of the character throughout the movie is played so expertly! You really do see her character grow and her opinions rendered incorrect - she too has prejudices.To me this is the best acting of Mr Darcy's character that I have seen. I found it easy to see the shyness in Darcy hiding behind his pride. To me I found this portrayal so right on with what I imagined in from the book. He is quiet and aloof, yet you find yourself drawn to him, much like Elizabeth does as she gets to know him. Darcy does not seem as harshly played in this production as he is in others. It is not as hard to imagine Elizabeth falling for him as in other films. In other productions his change from ""bad"" guy to ""good"" guy seems too fast, here the character has time to grow and we see glimpses of his true self - small in the beginning and then revealed more throughout the film.The scenery of the English Countryside from the village to the residences is beautiful - with incredible scenic shots that will make you want to pick up and move directly to the English countryside.The costumes are simple for the country ladies - One of the greatest examples is the scene in which Elizabeth comes to check on her ailing sister Jane, at the Bingley residence. Elizabeth appears as if she has had a terrible journey to arrive there. Standing in front of the proper ladies and Darcy she is a sight to behold - and so believable.This is definitely worth purchasing and if you love Jane Austen's works or simply a good period piece you will no doubt return to this film again and again.In a word beautiful."	5.0	Great Acting Classic Story	2009-04-16	5	3	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1PFRFGX0SXSKZ	"baltimore0502 ""Hon!"""	Okay, I was VERY skeptical of this remaking of P&P.; First off, feature films rarely do a good job of interpreting a book into a 2 hour film (I thought Zefferelli's Jane Eyre was just dreadful!). I also questioned the casting of Keira Knightley as one of literature's most beloved heroines, Elizabeth Bennett. I really didn't think she could pull it off. But she really did.I'm one of those fans that hold up the BBC/A&E; mini-series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as the gold standard as adaptations go. It wasn't perfect, but it was the best I'd seen to-date and I treasure my DVD copy. And so, it was with fairly low expectations that I went to see this film. But I must say that I was pretty impressed. The setting, as others have pointed out, was of a much more rural world where people got dirty and farm animals wander about in the front yard. I thought the depictions of the Bennett sisters were well done particularly Jena Malone's silly Lydia, Rosamund Pike just luminescent as Jane and Ms Knightly's fine job as Elizabeth. Brenda Blethyn was a much less flighty Mrs Bennett from the BBC version which was welcome. But I was not that wild about Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Mr Bennett. He seemed more willfully neglectful of his daughters than the more benign neglect depicted in the BBC version.As for the men, I know that for many Colin Firth IS Fitzwilliam Darcy (he's played him twice after all) but I found Matthew MacFadyen's portrayal more nuanced and sensitive, almost vulnerable than the more cool and haughty Firth version. I loved him! MacFadyen interprets Darcy's reserve not as superior hauteur so much as a sort of shyness. MacFadyen's Darcy seems to be a shy man who is uncomfortable with strangers and, perhaps, in his own skin. He's attracted to Elizabeth because she is everything he's not. She's totally comfortable with who she is and her place in the world even if she is often stifled by the social strictures of her day. Charles Bingley was portrayed as a boyish innocent and one could see why Darcy felt he had to look out for him. I really felt that the Caroline Bingley character was pretty inconsequential seemingly only there to give Jane the excuse to visit. But one never got the impression that Caroline even liked Jane in this version so that part was not very well done. I must confess that the portrayal of Mr Collins had me smiling with serious bemusement! He wasn't the buffoonish comic relief so much as a bit of an oddity! But the biggest surprise was what a small part George Wickham played in this story.And that is my biggest issue with the film. Other than Mr MacFadyen, Ms Knightly is the star around which everyone else orbits and as a result, everyone else comes off as fairly minor secondary characters. As expected, some events are missing or time periods compressed to fit the time requirements of the film. I suppose it's as faithful as a feature film could be, but it does sort of boil the book down to just the romance between Lizzie and Darcy. Other issues I had were some of the costuming which would have been inappropriate at the time. The almost slip dress that Caroline Bingley wears to the Netherfield ball would have been positively scandalous in the day (a night gown would have shown less skin!). And gloves would have been worn by both ladies and gentlemen at any social occasion. And there was also a scene where Lizzie and her sister are shopping in the village and her hair is down around her shoulders. A young lady of the day would never appear in public without her hair being put up! And I was very disappointed in the lackluster Lady Catherine DeBurgh this version offered. Judi Dench is fine, but she lacks the amusingly pompous condescension Lady Catherine had in the book and in the BBC version. She plays her too regally as my sister pointed out!Ah well, nothing in life is perfect, but bottom line, I enjoyed this adaptation and have added the DVD to my shopping card.  Highly recommended!	4.0	4 1/2 stars - probably as good as a feature film could be	2006-02-01	28	21	7

The above line, the last in the movie, I sincerely hope is from the book. It's so perfect. But of course, you have to know how it came to be so perfect, don't you?Keira Knightley is a beautiful woman, a superb actress, and could probably make any role a fine thing. But this is only the beginning. I love period pieces with great costumes and sets, and the old-fashioned dignity of the King's English, and those lush landscapes. And I do love Jane Austen. This movie not only has all that, but some sweet special touches, like Donald Sutherland in a role unlike any he has ever played before, with gentle humor and just exactly what's wanted in the father of five girls.The humor is gentle all through this movie, such as when the two oldest sisters giggle together under the covers over their reactions to the gentlemen at the rustic country ball. The contrast when an elegant upper crust ball is later held so gently illustrates that only those two eldest girls have the kind of class required to be at home in both circles. Yes, their mother is ridiculous, but she loves her girls sincerely, and did not manage to ruin their chances by being rather too obvious in attempting to marry them off.There are difficulties, of course, but the only tragedy comes when the youngest sister proves too eager to be married and runs off with a soldier. Yet rich relations can smooth things over, and she returns to the family a smug married woman, if not exactly a lady."	5.0	A Beautiful Movie About a Beautiful Book	2012-05-21	2	1	1

The reviews in favor of this move just explain how I feel better than I can.Yes, the story is shortened for the purpose of this movie and some of the characters are not as fully developed as in the book.  However, in the time alloted for a feature film, the director and actors stayed true to the spirit of the book and this is a great representation of the book.Matthew Macfadyen - what a performance!!!  He conveys so much with his eyes and facial expressions.  The most internally tortured Darcy I have ever seen.  While many seem to think Keira Knightley can't act,  I disagree.  A perfect Lizzie in my opinion.I haven't had a chance to see the BBC mini-series, which many seem to prefer, so I can't compare or contrast to this film.

But the ridiculous notion to attempt to edit P&P down to a 2 hr film just kills it. The story has been edited to death. Frankly, if you weren't already familiar with the story, I think so much has been cut out that it would be extremely difficult even to follow the plot. But more importantly, this version leaves zero room for the development of the characters' emotional attachments, and makes the alteration in Darcy's and Elizabeth's feelings toward each other seem completely unbelievable. It was a very unfortunate choice that mars what could have been a lovely production.	3.0	some good points, but edited to death	2014-06-14	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2VV4JWNKCQHF0	Basbenee	I've read Pride and Prejudice a couple of times, and loved the story, the characters (especially Elizabeth and Darcy), and Austen's humor. The miniseries from the mid 1990s with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle was fantastic too, with Firth as a perfect a Darcy as could be, and the whole thing capturing the spirit of the book. I heard a couple rave reviews of this adaptation, so I thought I'd check it out. Let's just say I want my two hours back. It's horrible. It's chopped way down so you just get a shell of the story, perhaps a cliff's notes version. You know what's going on, but you never get much of the wit and development. I didn't give a damn about any of the characters, like I did in the book and the miniseries. In those I was falling for Mr. Darcy right along with Elizabeth and wanting them together. In this version the characters just don't come to life. I didn't care what happened. And on top of that, despite the editing down of a classic to bare bones story, they still tossed in a lot of filler, lots of shots with some piano music tinkling away, and it's like, you couldn't have put a few more good lines of dialogue, explain more of the goings on? Anything? It just doesn't capture the spirit of the book; it's a lazy man's Austen. Bridget Jones' Diary (the movie, anyways, I didn't read the book), better caught the spirit of 'Pride and Prejudice,' with Firth as Darcy  (naturally) and Hugh Grant as Wickham, the crazy mom being the crazy mom with a bit of Lydia's drama thrown in. Rent that instead if you want a lighter version, or give the book and the miniseries a chance. It'll take longer to get through, but it's worth the time.	1.0	Dreadful	2007-03-03	31	18	13

I found the new movie enjoyable with some things being better than the BBC version.Kiera Knightley and Judi Dench's performances are outstanding.  Almost all of the acting was very good.  My problems were with how characters were changed and thus I didn't like their portrayal.  Elizabeth's father as portrayed by Donald Sutherland was much more sentimental and lacked the appropriate humor.  Both the Darcy and Wickham characters are barely known and thus essential aspects of the story can barely be comprehended.If you're familiar with the BBC version, the lines Darcy says to Elizabeth in the Knightley version are appallingly laughable.  They make Darcy out to be an idiotic geek rather than an intelligent yet shy man.  When it comes right down to it, the only way I can watch the Knightley version is if I skip any scenes with Darcy in them.  His lines are awful, the actor plays him like a sick lost puppy.  Ok my prejudice towards the BBC version is now coming out.  Colin Firth plays a far more believable Darcy, with dialogue fitting of the character.So I'd only recommend if you a)skip scenes with Darcy or b)have never read the book or seen the BBC version	3.0	Fine if you skip Darcy scenes	2006-08-15	13	4	9

I could have handled the romance novel ending, but for me, it was the changing of Jane Austen's words -- in particular the romantic words of Mr. Darcy.  What screenplay writer could possibly think they could improve on Ms. Austen's words after a few centuries?  It's unfathomable.  If you're not a huge fan of the book, or the BBC version, this is a fine rendition.  But truly, I think you'll wonder what all the hype is about on the book after just seeing this version.There's a lot of book to be condensed in two hours, so I will give them credit for that -- but if you're going to change the book, do it with style -- like the BBC did with Colin Firth diving into the pond on his visit back to Pemberley.

I have seen other P&P; films in the past, and the one that blew me away was the 1996 A&E; version. This new film doesn't measure up.1) Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle defined the story's characters beyond belief; in fact, the whole cast was superior (you felt as if Jane Austen's characters jumped off the pages). There was chemistry, subtlety, passion, etc. Here, the characters seemed undeveloped/undimensional and lacked all the qualities of the book's characters.2) The length of the 1996 movie gave a lot of detail and was well-developed; the story made much more sense in terms of why and how everything was happening. Here, they just took out all the main parts from the plot and pasted them together, leaving you to wonder if more was supposed to happen. Also, in the 1996 movie, Elizabeth and Darcy saw each other quite often, and each interaction contributed to the overall progression of their relationship; you can see why Elizabeth disliked Darcy and how she slowly started changing her mind. Here, one minute she hates him, and then, after hearing a couple of nice sentences from people, she, all of a sudden, ""magically"" loves him. The two characters barely saw each other and have not even held a real conversation, except for the scene where Darcy makes his first proposal, and is turned down, yet they somehow fell madly in love with each other...?3) 1996: Manners, etiquette, and traditions of the elite British class were captured quite well. You really saw how courtship was intended to be, and how marriage was looked upon. Here:too much Americanization going on (""Hollywood BS"" I call it!). Certain parts were ridiculous (Lady Catherine's night visit, Mr.Bennett's dialogue, Charles Bingley's moron personality, Elizabeth's nightgown run, and the list goes on.......)Basically, a bunch of Americans (with exceptions, of course) pretending to know about British culture.I could go on forever with a list of complaints, but I don't want to bore the readers! If you're going to make a romantic film, make it about anything else, but don't take a classic novel and pretend that you can pull it off with good cinematography.Overall, if you have no idea what the book is about and have never read it (like this version's filmmakers), you might enjoy see this P&P; movie because it's a ""romance"". Just watch it as it is and don't give a second thought to what Jane Austen's story really stood for. Enjoy the costumes, music, etc, but don't pay attention to the plot.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A37IL8B2RL95PL	"Becky Hatfield ""book fire wolf"""	"The Tagline of the Movie: ""The one man she cannot stand, may be the one man she can't live without.""The new version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a must own for lovers at heart. Wonderfully casted by Jina Jay, she brings the story of the prideful Elizabeth Bennett and the prejudiced Mr. Darcy to life in this updated classic. Starring in the lead roles Keira Knightly,Matthew Macfadyen, and along with other well known actors Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench.This remake blends the unique acting of today with the glorius scenery of the past. Keira Knightly proudly shows that she is a very powerful Elizabeth Bennett, especially in a wonderful night scene shot with Judi Dench along with the scene's shot with the gentle Donald Sutherland. Matthew Macfadyen positively shines in his role as a tormented and shy man trying to overcome his prejudice to win the woman of his heart.Yet I will remark that for those that see this, try not to compare it with the wondefully done BBC miniseries version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle done in 1995. Now while I enjoyed this film and found it exhilarating from beggining to end, it does go very fast at certain parts and slow it seems at others, but overall a wonderful remake of the famous book, and a version for any true lover at heart."	5.0	Ultimate Love Story	2006-03-01	10	7	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3KZHOP628OZ2E	"Be Fine ""Bronte Fan"""	"While obviously abridged compared to the A&E; mini series, this P&P; is dead-on accurate.  Though I still appreciate the A&E; version, Wright captured the 'everyday-ness' of Austin's time: the dirt, the dress, the deportment, and Austin's well crafted satire.Compared to Wright's P&P;,  A&E;'s characters are wooden while Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Collins and, Mr. Wickham are nearly cartoonish.  On the other hand, Wright's Lady Catherine seems overblown though in the capable hands of Dame Dench, and Donald Sutherland's physicality doesn't quite fit Mr. Bennett though he does capture the character's charm & sense of humor.Wright's costuming & sets were well researched exemplified by older women wearing less fashionable gowns and younger women dressing more stylishly within their particularsocial rank.  In the A&E; P&P;, there is little variation in dress with so much pure white linen which could lead one to wonder if Longbourne was a suburb of Heaven.Wright's choreography and camera work really 'raised the bar' for historical dramas, too.  A&E;'s comes across as overly reheased & rigidely exacting while the camera remains static.  All of this results in scenes that are ""not so much like a ball"".With the luxury of time, the A&E; P&P; does include the entire Wickham subplot, one which Wrightwas required to  abridge but did so fairly elegantly.  Both versions exclude the novel's postscript-like conclusion.Enjoy both, and a read of Austen's novel."	5.0	A P&P True to Period	2008-01-10	7	5	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2Z5NCG2SBI58Q	"Belinda J. Palmer ""Belinda Palmer"""	I'm not sure why the script writers turned the Bennets into poorly dressed, groomed and behaved...slobs, really...living in an unkempt farm house. Or Lizzie Bennet twirling around on a swing in the barn, _barefoot_? The pig walking through their house was just too much. Lowering the family in this manner made the film very objectionable to me.So much of Jane Austen's wonderful, witty dialogue is omitted, and occasionally handed off to someone else to suit the scenes. The story had a casual, Colonial American feel to it rather than the prim and proper English flavor as it was written. Darcy, Lady Katherine and Mrs. Bennet were very dull. Bingly was very miscast as a dolt. Jane Bennet, Mr. Wickam and troublesome Lydia were practically invisible. So much of the rich romantic tension between Elizabeth and Darcy was lost by cutting out so much of the story.If you're looking for a more accurate adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, you'll be pleased with the 1995 miniseries. You'll see the Bennets careful to behave within the social politics of their society. They aren't wealthy, but they still dress, groom and carry themselves well. Mrs. Bennet is an obnoxious, gossipy social climber. Mr. Darcy is proud and unlikeable until Lizzie sets him straight during his rude marriage proposal. Mr. Bingly is intelligent and kindhearted. Lady Katherine gives Lizzie a hard time with her pious prejudice. Mr. Collins is amusing in his cluelessness. Mr. Wickam is a rake you'll love to hate.I know a 2 hour movie can't compare to a 6 hour miniseries. Perhaps if I hadn't seen the miniseries first, I would've liked the theater version. But I really didn't enjoy it at all because so much of the story was cut out and/or changed.	1.0	A Pig Walking Through the Bennet House?	2006-03-03	43	28	15

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AR37967IAR6ZT	Benjamin	Of all the movies on my Top 10 list, this adaptation of Jane Austen's classic was the one I was the most reluctant to include because it's light and airy, it's a story that I've seen done before and because I knew a lot of Austen fans don't like it because it takes liberties with her apparently sacred text. But then I thought about the movie itself and how I felt swept up in it while it played in front of me. This new PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a thoroughly engaging, lushly romantic time at the movies, presenting us with two brilliant, headstrong characters who are too stubborn to admit that they love each other. In this year of surprisingly strong performances that seem to come out-of-nowhere, Keira Knightley achieves the nearly impossible by making the role of Elizabeth Bennet entirely her own. By minimizing every part of the story that didn't deal directly with Elizabeth, director Joe Wright and screenwriter Deborah Moggach have created a swift, fun adaptation of the work that just keeps building momentum. It's thoroughly charming.	5.0	Romantic masterpiece.	2006-01-03	12	10	2

However, if you haven't watched any other versions,you will love this one.

This presentation they plow through, talk fast and spend more time making faces. However the wide long shots of the country side are impressive (especially in Blu-ray). I have seen some to the houses in a TV production on ""Great Houses of Britain"". However Donald Sutherland is a good contributor as Mr. Benet.Oh Great Scott, forget about what I said in the first paragraph as the presentation finally picks up as everyone gets over the initial deceptions. So do not give up on this movie too early. Finally we get the highs and lows that we planned on.It is not the easiest thing to tell the story as by the time you view this presentation you should already be familiar with Jane Austen. If not we do not eat to give too many things away. To say that the Bennet family of all daughters will lose their meager estate at the passing of the father. Only a male can inherit property.So it is time to marry off the daughters. As the story unfolds you will understand the title of the story. The main focus is on the banter between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy surrounded by others that are also posturing. Is there opportunity that all well be well in the end or will the whole thing unravel?For people not acquainted with Jane Austin you will see that she is not an obscure writer of only a hand full of novels but someone that was taken from us too soon.Screenplay by Deborah Moggach.

I loved the book, and I loved the old Olivier version of the film.  My skepticism disappeared as I watched the film, however.Yes, the script departs from the novel, but that's to be expected.  What I truly enjoyed was that the characters were portrayed in a way that I'd always imagined.  Mr. Bennett is long-suffering and sweet, with a wry wit.  Mrs. Bennett is a hilarious busybody, who really does love her daughters.  Jane is beautiful and dignified.  Elizabeth is sassy, smart, and stubborn.  Mr. Darcy is (very) handsome and dashing, while still being endearingly socially awkward.  Mr. Collins is wonderfully icky.Another thing I enjoyed was that many of the scenes were beautifully shot. Mr. Darcy's quick doubletake when he sees Elizabeth at the party, and the close shot of him flexing his hand after helping Elizabeth from the carriage are wonderful.  The near-kiss scene during the rainstorm could make even very sensible women feel a bit fluttery.  The gorgeous scenery-- magnificent old houses, gnarled old trees, foggy meadows-- add to the romance of the film.I do have two quarrels with the film, however.  The two youngest Bennett sisters are a bit too giddy, and their giggling becomes tiresome after a while.  Also, the ending was more sappy than romantic.I first watched the film last night, ordered it today, and can't wait to watch it again.	4.0	Beautifully shot adaptation	2006-03-04	18	16	2

Own every BBC adaptation of her work, including the 1995 Firth version. I love it, of course (isn't it sacrilegious to say otherwise?) but felt the characters were sometimes miscast--they seemed older in that version...and though it kept somewhat close to the text, there were some things that fell flat to me. In this version, there are obviously adaptations and changes--but I love the casting. I think the casting, music and visuals are perfections. The dancing scenes? You can feel the energy. I love Caroline Bingley in this--perfection! And Mrs./Mr. Bennet? I love the interaction. I feel like I can see the &#34;family&#34; part of the Bennets in this--the relationships feel extraordinarily real. And I think that Jane Austen would approve of that. Yes it's not perfect. Yes, there are things changed/left out. But I'm okay with that. Each adaptation has its strengths--and I love this one as much as any!	5.0	From an Austen aficionado--love it!	2014-03-24	0	0	0

The designers showed great perception in having different levels of up-to-dateness and fashion among the various characters; the visuals are almost without fault, and the soundtrack is not bad at all.On the other hand, Jane Austen should never seem fast-paced, even within the limitations of cutting a novel down to fit within 2 hours or so (there's a reason why there's a mystery series where the detective is Jane Austen herself) and there is also lacking in the movie a sense of Jane Austen's ineffable good humor.  People are all to willing to tell their secrets, and constantly saying ""Oh, didn't you know? . . .""  and, for example, when Charlotte announces that she is to marry Mr. Collins, she exclaims, ""Don't you dare judge me, Lizzie!"" when there was no question of Elizabeth judging Charlotte in the book at all, only questioning her future happiness.So you'll probably enjoy the movie more if you're not a Jane Austen fan to begin with than if you are."	3.0	Good movie; poor adaptation	2008-10-08	6	3	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A17QWV4ZCWCQ2K	"BigBirdFrank ""Frank from Minnesota"""	This is perhaps my favorite tale of society culture and men and young women finding love. It is also my favorite Jane Austin book and movie and series.  It is set at just about the turn of the century in around 1800.  It must have been a naughty kind of a read because Austin really does use the book to poke fun at the Aristocracy and the way they turn their noses down at everyone.  There is one slightly superior BBC version made up of several episodes where the young lady who played Elizabeth is just as pretty as Keira Knightly with long and beautiful black hair and an ivory complexion, but I so enjoyed this one too.  How indifference becomes irritation and then almost hate before we see an perfect partner as who he or she really is must be the most endearing story of romance.  They each see a reflection of each other in their stubborn pride and it's what each dislike about themselves.  Well, they have to get over that because there is a lot they share in common.  Darcy is very handsome, but shy.  Elizabeth is very beautiful and used to speaking her mind.  Her father encourages that a great deal.  Her mom is pushing all the girls to get married and Elizabeth will not be married just to obtain a better station in life for herself.  The poor and lower aristocracy is represented in the Bennetts with Elizabeth as one of many daughters.  They are intelligent and spirited and have a good opinion of themselves.  Mr Darcy and his friend Mr. Bingley come to stay in their own grand homes.  They are high aristocracy.  Can rich fall in love with poor? Does wealth matter very much when love is what matters.  We shall see and you will enjoy the whole funny, tender, and mishap filled road to romance.  Very, very enjoyable and really quite hopeful and upbeat overall.	5.0	Pride & Prejudice starring Keira Knightly	2012-11-24	2	1	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A310WMJTMJA47J	Bill Knapp	An excellent cast is almost completely wasted in this production, in which Austen's rich characters, social commentary, ascerbic wit, and wonderful language are stripped away to make room for a banal, brooding romance.For the Austen reader the film's main attraction is the intellectual appeal of its attempt to present a different interpretation of the novel. (Warning... be prepared for some really, really, really clumsy editing, writing and adaptation.) In addition to that, and to its lush, if greasy, production values, there is consolation in the wonderful form of Judi Dench, the first actress to create a truly intimidating Lady Catherine - hence the two-star, rather than a one-star, rating.To the non-Austen reader, in search of a cute movie, this is likely just the ticket.If you're thinking of buying it, though, I'd wait for a year or so... by then the novelty should have worn off and the price cut by quite a bit.	2.0	A comic book version of a Harlequin romance edition of Pride and Prejudice the way Charlotte Bronte might  have written it	2006-03-07	25	9	16

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3B56B4LKCINMN	blibberinghumdinger	"I may be the only person in the world to not like the 1995 BBC version of P&P.; I was cringing inside right before I started watching this one terrified they were going to butcher Austen's language like that adaptation. But I was pleasantly surprised to hear the good old words I know and love. The screenplay is wonderful. Thank you, thank you, thank you! They have chopped out a lot of scenes from the book and shortened a lot of speeches, but what they have retained is mostly verbatim and/or sounds just like Austen and will not offend.What else is there to say? Everything about it is fantastic. Music, acting, direction. As an art historian, I was especially enraptured with the cinematography, scenery and use of art. It was amazing. I love the genre scenes around her house with the hay bales, man with pipe, pigs.This is without a doubt the sexiest P&P; I've ever seen. Its all about the passions that are exploding beneath the surface. Matthew MacFadyen is especially good at conveying this.Notice what the director does with the theme of eyes and looking. Jane says, ""One of these days someone is going to catch your eye and then you'll have to watch your tongue!"" In the very next scene Darcy appears and when he's walking down the room at the first ball he does the smallest of double takes when he sees her. Its all about the glances towards and away from each other. Keira is wonderful with her eyes, especially in the last scene.Brenda Blethyn = hilarious. The best Mrs. Bennett I've seen. Rosamund Pike = perfect. Keira Knightly = brilliant. I liked Donald Sutherland, but please. That was not the Mr. Bennet. They've sweetened him to a ridiculous degree. Doesn't bother me, but its a flagrant departure from the book. I greatly missed Elizabeth and Darcy sparring at Netherfield. ""Your defect is a propensity to hate everybody!"" That was the only scene that I really did miss, though, and they cut out a lot. Otherwise I hardly noticed it. Best scene = the ""car crash"" proposal in the thunderstorm.This is a gorgeous, romantic film. Absolutely loved it."	5.0	Fantastic	2006-03-04	10	7	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2HYE9VD3I0NWU	blueskies	I loved this movie. Up until now I've been a fan of the BBC/A & E version. Honestly I don't understand the people who are almost religious about having the novel match up the film 100%. You can't always do that on film, especially if you want to have a good movie, and what is it with people being picky about historical accuracies, come on its a movie, not a history book. The film is pretty loyal to Austen's novel and its not like it tries to intentionally mess up on the period that its set in. In short, don't be religious about things. Get over it. This movie is perfect as it is and I love it, its even better than the BBC/A & E version. Keira Knightley is an excellent actress and one that I look forward to watching over the years.	5.0	simply wicked baby	2006-11-30	12	8	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A4B3AYDIDRJ80	Blu	"I own the BBC version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and I must say that both films were good in their own rights.  I do believe that anyone viewing either of these two fine films must judge them as such instead of comparing the two.I will admit that this version has proven to be a favorite of mine between the two (I watch it at least once a week - gotta have my dose of Darcy *grin).  For one, this version was more ""romantic"" to me - Darcy helping Lizzie into the carriage, Darcy watching Lizzie on the ballroom floor, etc.  This really assisted in making Darcy's sudden proposal to Lizzie more believable whereas in the A & E version (not comparing, merely pointing out) - I was surprised by the declaration of love because I didn't see it coming.  There were no obvious signs that Darcy held any affections for Lizzie other than an occassional glance here and there.  In short, Firth and Eahle lacked the chemistry that Knightley and McFayden had in this version of the film.  Although I absolutely adore Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy - it took me a minute to warm up to him as he initially came off as a snob.  Matthew Macfayden portrays Darcy as more of a man who although he possesses great wealth, he lacks simple social skills.  I fell in love with the sweetness of his face and the scene with him walking across the field as his long coat blows in the breeze accompanied by that gorgeous music...*fanning self frantically  His walk, his voice, and his magnificent physique combined have made me stand up and unashamedly declare that MATTHEW MCFAYDEN IS ""THE"" MR. DARCY!!!Also, the fact that this film was slightly over 2 hours as opposed to the other, longer versions of the story was a definite plus to me.For those reviewers who wish to harp about the clothing being wrong for the time period or certain behaviors being unacceptable and unheard of for that era...give it a rest, please!  I am an avid reader of historical romances and an avid viewer of period pieces, most with romantic themes, and I'm here to tell you that when I'm in the mood for a good romance - I could care less if the heroe's cravat is knotted incorrectly for that time of the evening during that particular time period - I'm more concerned with a good romance!  And this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" delivers just that!  A beautiful and romantic tale!  Now if Mr. Darcy had decided to deal with Lizzie's rejection by flopping in front of the t.v. to watch reruns of ""The Golden Girls"" I might have had issues.  *laugh  You get my point though - those details are minor.  In the end, it's the story that counts.I would DEFINITELY recommend to anyone looking for a sweet romance and a wonderful film.p.s. I mistakenly hit four stars when I meant to hit five!  Amazon doesn't allow you to change your rating for some odd reason.  *shrug  Trust me when I say - this film is all of 5 stars!!!"	4.0	I Enjoyed It Thoroughly!	2006-02-28	23	19	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2ATWKOFJXRRR1	"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice has been translated to film several times now - from Robert Leonard's 1940 ""attempt"" starring Laurence Olivier, to the 1980 and 1995 TV miniseries', and now on to a new theatrical release here. Having read the book and seen all of these adaptations, I feel I can comment objectively on what does and doesn't work with regards to director Joe Wright's newest version.Let's start with the positives. It's beautifully filmed (from gnarled old trees to stunning sunsets against old English mansions) and the cast performs well. I even liked Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods, FOYLE'S WAR TV series) and the rest of the actors. They seemed to be able to grasp the internal dynamics of their respective characters and pulled in fine performances. Keira Knightley (BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, 2002) does a good job as Lizzie Bennett but appears upbeat far too often during a time when love and loss went hand in hand. Matthew Macfayden (WUTHERING HEIGHTS TV series) does an admirable Mr. Darcy but being up against a giant of the English acting world from a previous adaptation made his character representation a bit tougher when it came to comparisons.Now let's get into my main problem: the pacing. I usually don't mind fast-paced films, but Jane Austen's book is anything but quick (checking in at around 500 pages depending on which publisher you choose). Books of this size tend to be difficult to translate to the silver screen (or TV) because of their scope, and this was the big ""ouch"" for this film. Clocking in at 129 minutes, condensing the book in such a drastic manner meant clipping out chapters and causing a bit of confusion. The confusion comes from the lack of understanding a new viewer might have IF they've never seen any of the previous TV/movie versions or IF they've never read the novel. When Lydia runs off with ""the wrong man"" it is a vital portion of the story that is only touched on and could seem disorienting to the new Pride and Prejudice viewer. We never see what happens to Lydia in London, nor do we see the wedding and where Mr. Darcy's pressure exerts itself.Comparisons will obviously be made between this theatrical release and the 1995 miniseries (which many, including myself, feel is the penultimate adaptation of Mrs. Austen's book). Some might complain that it isn't fair to make such comparisons because one was designed for television while the other was meant for theater. I'll grant that. But with the lengthy films that've come out of Hollywood lately (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, etc.), I don't feel that this new version would've suffered in the slightest by lengthening its running time and thus adding a better sense of coherency to many of the side stories. The 1995 miniseries also had an incredible benefit in that Mr. Darcy was played by the estimable Colin Firth (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, 1998), and it is THIS Mr. Darcy that many hold as the high standard for such work. Try putting Matthew Macfayden up against Mr. Firth and you'll see what I mean; there's just no comparing them.I did give this film a positive review because a) I liked the cinematography, and b) the acting was generally well done. But for emotional impact and excellent character portrayals look to the 1995 miniseries."	4.0	A Good (Not Great) Adaptation	2006-04-20	14	8	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2EMWBRQSU8ZU5	BNK214	This movie adaptation does a surprisingly good job of slimming down Ms. Austen's original by somewhat reinterpreting it.  Movies do have to vigorously cut a book down to size, and Ms. Moggach (with a little help from Emma Thompson) did a right fine job. In fact, in some ways the changes actually improve upon the book.  Heresy, I know, but supportable.  For instance, Mrs. Bennett seems less a caricature and more an actual human.  Her annoying proclivities and her relationship to Mr. Bennett are less condescendingly (in the modern sense) drawn.  Also, the relationship between Elizabeth and her friend Ms. Lucas captures real warmth not really present in the book.  Some characters are less well drawn and the movie suffers as a result.  I&#8217;m thinking principally of Mr. Wickham.  In any case, as with any movie based on a beloved book, it is difficult to properly capture the writer&#8217;s language, and it is Austen&#8217;s use of the English language that causes me to return to the novel with regularity.  Thus, I give this movie four stars.  That said, the writer did some fine cherry picking to retain some favorite lines.  By the way, as others have noted, if you want a more complete and excellent visual production of Ms. Austen&#8217;s masterpiece, seek the 1995 Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle BBC television version.  It has multiple episodes to work with and takes full advantage of the extra time.The leads in this movie version are quite good.  Ms. Knightly shines brilliantly.  All of the supporting cast, with the possible exception of Bingley&#8217;s sister and Mr. Wickham, are also outstanding.  Even here I am admittedly quibbling because I am not sure the writer or director gave (or could give) them much to work with.  The casting of Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourgh was, frankly, perfect.  That woman is amazing.Now having watched this movie version, I know I will watch it again.  I broke down and bought the BD/DVD combo from Amazon.  I certainly recommend it, even to the strongest of Ms. Austen's fans.	4.0	Recommended	2014-07-05	0	0	0

This is occasionally (not always - thus four stars) a visually stunning film, and I don't mean Keira's face (Austen must have rolled over in her grave with that casting.)The version I like to think Jane A. would have preferred is of course the fabulous BBC version with Colin Firth as Darcy, and the wonderful Jennifer Ehle, who was born to play Elizabeth.Anyway, the camera people and the screenplay people made certain moments of this P&P; as visually moving as any I've seen in a long time.  The scene with Liz on the swing as the seasons change; the early morning scene when Darcy and Liz meet in the ...fog; the camera movement at the second ball, the confrontation in the rain; etc., these I could watch a thousand times.  Offsetting these, are the terrible ending, the family scene at the beginning, and several other weak moments (the statue admiration scene at Darcy's mansion...is she staring at what I think she's staring at?!)

Though it doesn't cover all the intricate details of the story and the characters the way the BBC version does, this new version offers so much more in the way of such spectacular scenery and breathtaking scenes of vivid emotion between Elizabeth and Darcy. With this version you really feel as though you were there witnessing how the Bennets really lived in a way that's easier to visualize and relate to.  Further more, it was quite refreshing to see Keira put so much feeling and personality into her role like I have never seen ""Elizabeth"" portrayed before.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A31C7OGHEQLK29	"Bookcat ""Cat"""	"Yet another Jane Austen movie?  You could say that this stinker is an Austen-INSPIRED movie.  But any inspiration was all on Miss Austen's side.  Any movie adaptation must take some artistic license even with a literary classic, but this dreadful production takes too many unforgiveable liberties.  This is for the crowd that reads Austen and thinks, ""Great story, but where's the sex?""The movie goes off course in very basic ways--plot, theme, characters and setting.  The principal characters are prominent people of means.  Why do they all look as though they need a hairbrush and a bath?  Mr. Bennet is a solitary bookworm with an acerbic wit.  How did he become become a disheveled hick?  Miss Austen writes that Elizabeth had a lively air of sportive playfulness that made it difficult for her to offend anybody.  So why are we treated to so many views of Keira Knightley's bared, vampiric teeth as she bites off her sadly abridged lines?  Matthew Fayden is an equally unsatisfactory Darcy, so far removed from the handsome, elegant, arrogance of the original that we keep waiting for the hero to show up and get the story going.  Lady Catherine is all sweaty vitriol, too vituperative to be as ridiculous as she should be.The change of setting to the Georgian period is a poor fit, as is the barnyard the Bennets appear to occupy.  Mr. Bennet is a gentleman, not a gentleman farmer.  The Elizabeth-Darcy romance is better attuned to the early age of romanticism, particularly in the relationship of the characters to nature.  Austen heroines like to be outdoors, and many pivotal scenes take place in a garden.  This aspect was far better treated in the films ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Persuasion,"" and the BBC's Austen productions, which are more appropriately set in the Regency period.Worst of all is that final scene!  Like so many dimwitted authors who spin off Austen's novels into hot steaming garbage, someone tacked a jarring final scene onto this film that feels all the more coarse for bringing such an elegant tale to a tasteless conclusion.  Not that all the scenes that precede it are much better; but they merely distort the story.  Its clumsy ending hammers it into a cynical, profit-seeking uber-anachronism."	1.0	Mr. and Mrs. Bennet as Ma and Pa Kettle	2009-09-23	23	17	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AJFEHDTYB3W8K	Bookperson	I purchased this on a friend's recommendation, but I wish I had read more of the reviews first. An earlier reviewer described this as P&P as written by Charlotte Bronte and that about sums it up. Austen's sly social commentary and witty observations on human nature have been replaced by atmospheric shots of rain-drenched, fog-filled gloom and wavering shadows in candle-lit rooms. Elizabeth comes across as shrewish and broody, with none of the vivacity and quick wit of the original. Darcy seems dull and socially backward instead of a man restrained by his own rigid view of propriety and his place in the social caste. The secondary cast get only one or two pertinent lines from the novel to establish their character and motives, which reduces the circumstances that drive the plot to a one-dimensional Cliff Notes version of P&P.	2.0	Cliff Notes version of P&P	2010-05-17	7	4	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1HBC0NBQJHT7X	Bookphile	I was certain it was impossible to improve upon the BBC's stellar interpretation of P&P.;  I was sure that no one could improve upon Jennifer Ehle and I was certain that Colin Firth was the penultimate Darcy.  This movie proved me wrong.Firstly, I want to address Keira Knightley's interpretation of my all-time favorite literary heroine.  She had the spark and fire and quick wit that is so characteristic of Elizabeth.  I thought her performance was pitch perfect and I give her the edge of Ehle.  While I do really like Ehle's rather more sedate Elizabeth, I really liked Knightley's more impetuous version.  Her outbursts sprang from her with such passion and impatience that I felt she had really nailed the character.As for Darcy, I love Firth's arrogant but socially awkward portrayal.  Because of this, I was glad to see Matthew Macfadyen play Darcy as something of a nerd.  It was an interpretation of Darcy that I'd never pictured but I think it worked splendidly.  Rather than being overtly haughty as Firth's Darcy was, Macfadyen's Darcy was painfully socially awkward and who came across as arrogant because of it.  His Darcy was intensely private and unwilling to give up his family secrets and yet all the more pained for how he knew it made him seem to Elizabeth.The rest of the cast is stellar as well, though I won't go into great depth or I'll risk running on for pages.  I particularly liked Elizabeth's warm relationship with her father and the way his eyes teared over when he wished Elizabeth happiness in her betrothal.  I also liked the way Mrs. Bennett was made more complex and her motivations made more clear.  After all, what did a woman of that social standing have to do other than ensure her daughters made prosperous marriages?  Mrs. Bennett seems so silly until one considers just how stressful it must have been to have to worry about the welfare of so many girls and to be constantly conscious of how quickly they'd sink into poverty and oblivion if their father--the sole breadwinner--were to become ill or die.The film itself is wonderfully layered and I find that with each viewing I see subtle things I had not before noticed.  It certainly bears repeat viewings not just for the wonderful story, gorgeous scenery, and stellar acting but also for the subtle background touches that become apparent once one focuses on them rather than the action occurring in the foreground.  This version is rife with small gestures and looks that speak volumes about what is occurring in the story.  Simply put, I adore this film.	5.0	A gorgeous adaptation	2007-07-26	14	9	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1WGHAW0YRSG7G	"Bookworm Extraordinaire ""Me"""	This movie does just what a classic love story should.  It takes two headstrong people with (very) different backgrounds and throws them together against the backdrop of an over-polite society and social prejudice.Each and every actor in this film is perfect and thoroughly believable.Kiera Knightley, though playing a character with limited opportunity to show her evident quickness of tongue, managed to jut her chin and give back-handed insults just enough to flaunt the independent spirit of Elizabeth Bennet.Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy was an interesting casting choice.  What I particularly like about this man was that he isn't your average pretty boy.  Macfadyen gave the character (and audience) something more than just the gorgeous smile and perfectly placed hair so often seen on Hollywood screens.Rosamund Pike, playing Elizabeth's sister Jane, shone in a supporting role.  Her short scenes were beautiful, full of hope, tears-on-cue, and occasional self-doubt.And it's not just Rosamund either.  The other supporting characters, in all their glory, delivered just enough giggling or disdain or awkwardness as was required.I definitely enjoyed this movie.  It made me think.Just a warning: you may be initially caught off guard by a certain important protestation of love from one character to another, but, upon review, you will discover that significant looks and the like were evident throughout the earlier bits of the film.Rent or buy this ASAP - you won't regret it!	5.0	Classic....	2006-05-28	11	7	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3TJE6ES8PQ358	bookworm in entrelac	I have to say that I am a huge fan of the book and the BBC version with Colin Firth. Sadly, I absolutely despise this version of Pride and Prejudice. Of course, I expected much of the story line to be abbreviated given the 2 hr running time, but I did not expect the blatant disregard for the integrity of Austen's characters. It was bad enough to see Jane's sweet disposition misrepresented, but the oversimplification and shallowness of the Eliza and Mr. Darcy characters is unforgivable.Eliza was silly and flip without any of the depth, thoughtfulness, and complexity that her character merits. Mr. Darcy was sullen, brooding, and dull instead of being aloof and reserved. Neither character demonstrated the depth and range of character portrayed in the book, perhaps because the movie doesn't ring true with the formality and strictness of British society during that time that is conveyed in Austen's novel. Instead, the movie overly glamorizes the period and indulges the characters with glitzy, unrestrained, and sappy romantic conversational tripe. I couldn't even finish the last ten minutes of the movie!If you have any love or respect for Austen's story, I would not watch this movie.	1.0	beauty without substance	2007-12-27	45	33	12

I like both the Firth and the Knightley versions. Funny how when we think of the BBC we think more of Mr. Darcy (Firth) and when we think of this one we think more of Elizabeth (Knightley).There are many scenes from each of the P&Ps; that I can say I like over the other, so I can't pick a true favorite version. Even with significant script downsizing and tweaking in this version, overall you still get the many *SIGH* moments between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth and the laugh out loud moments with Mr. Collins (I'm forever a fan of the Hollander actor who played him in this rendition!). You sympathize and adore Charlotte (who is very believable as the plain ""spinster-in-the-making"" than the other versions) and WHO can bring aristocracy to the screen like the dame Judi?  This role was made for her and out of all P&P; ladyships, she is by far my favorite portrayal. I was also happy with the Lydia casting - her portrayal was the perfect comedic silly and selfish.LOVED Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennett!  You get an idea of why they aren't in the best financial shape with his laid back and resigned attitude - the go-getter he is not. The scene between he and Lizzie at the end is very touching.  Any daddy's little girl will be moved when they watch it.  I know I was and still am every time I see it.Matthew MacFayden did a fine job with his portrayal of the handsome and initially stoic and snobbish Mr. Darcy.  I think his emotions and tenderness really trasmitted itself well across the screen as his feelings grew for Elizabeth.  Truly FINE performances from all of the cast.Some have brought up the discrepancies in this P&P;, yet I do not remember Mr. Darcy swimming in a lake and coming out of it sexy and dripping wet in the book like he did in the Firth version - yet we do not complain about it. That's because it was a GREAT scene (for the ladies) and it didn't take away from the movie.  There are going to be changes in each one, as long as it doesn't take away from the romance of the two and the gist of the story (again many only have 2 hours), I think when given a chance, P&P; lovers will really enjoy this one.I would have loved to have seen more effort with the costume designs, but overall I really LOVED the movie and occasionally when I have 2 hours on a rainy day, I'll pop it in.

Further, I give Joe Wright a great deal of credit for building the film as much around Keira Knightly as her character; she's way too attractive to be playing Elizabeth, so he made the right call in turning the dynamic of the story and the pace of the film more suitable to modern-day ""hopeless romantics"" than a Regency period piece. I wanted to quibble at first, but I think it makes a superior film: while not all the compromises worked, the film was shot and edited so well that many of the changes were extremely moving (I particularly liked the obvious symbolism of the sculptures in the Pemberly estate)...and I actually thought the characterization of Bingley was perfect. Besides, Keira Knightly has arguably the best smile I've ever seen; I could spend hours just looking at it.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ANVJ3T79WQLK1	Bre	I suppose if you've never read Pride and Prejudice this may be a fine film (that's why I gave it two stars instead of just one), but it in NO way does any justice to Jane Austen's novel. Perhaps it's impossible to build the depth of character the way Austen does in a 2 hour movie, but it's because it was only 2 hours long that I was able to even sit through this movie. From the start I was sceptical of Kiera Knightly as Elizabeth Bennett, but in the end it wasn't her performance that disappointed - the whole movie was seriously lacking. Maybe Austen just can't be satisfied in 2 hours, but I was left thinking, That's it? What a sorry tribute to a classic.This version is FAR inferior to the A&E; miniseries (about 5 hours of Eliza and Mr. Darcy) which aired on Masterpiece Theatre and, I felt, illustrated the novel as beautifully as an on-screen adaptation can. If you'd like to see this classic on the screen, make time for the A&E; version and forget this one.	2.0	Don't read the book, you'll just be disappointed in this movie.	2008-03-29	13	6	7

Here we have a parade of third millennium anachronisms almost as preposterous as those on display in the equally absurd current rendering of ""Tristan and Isolde."" Thus, our heroine Kiera Knightley sails through the whole film with a saucy, feminist tinged, ""cat that swallowed the canary,"" facial expression and vocal delivery, that suggest that she has been watching a great deal of Katie Couric and Elizabeth Vargas, and is dying to drop the word ""empowerment,"" somewhere into her dialogue.Then there's the ""incomparable,"" Judi Dench--(as the publicity breathlessly assures us). For some incomprehensible reason, contemporary casting directors' are under the lamentable delusion that Miss Dench, (like Maggie Smith) is somehow suited to grande dame roles--when nothing could be further from the truth.Having seen Miss Dench on stage in a five hour production of ""Cymbeline,"" at Stratford on Avon, I can personally attest to her range and power as an actress. However, whatever her qualifications for Shakespeare, there is nothing in her appearance or deportment that is remotely aristocratic in the 18th/19th century sense of the term.Indeed, if anything, her persona is pronouncedly proletariat.Add to that her coarse and rubicund complexion, (un-pancaked in the current naturalistic mode) and her Lady Catherine appears more like a refugee from a Hogarthian gin palace than the daunting and imperious creature Miss Austen intended.Martita Hunt where are you now that we need you?There is little to say about Donald Sutherland in the role of Mr. Bennet, inasmuch as he has built a successful career out of being miscast--a feat he continues with this role. And his wife in the picture, (far from the lavender, rose silk and cream Mary Boland of yore) looks like a blowsy, overage bawd from the cast of a backwoods dinner theater production of ""Moll Flanders,"" who has somehow wandered onto the wrong movie set.But mercifully we at length arrive at the priceless (and now requisite) final clinch, where Miss Knightley and Mr. Macfadyen are depicted in the lotus position on a lake in front of their chteau, where they proceed to launch into a demonstration of mutual affection that looks like a TV promo for ""The Bachelor,"" and makes one wonder if Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts are standing just outside of camera range whispering instructions.For now if you absolutely require a filmed alternative to the novel itself--stick with the 1940 Greer Garson or unfairly ignored 1979 British TV version."	2.0	Woefully miscast !	2006-06-14	20	11	9

I won't rehash the plot here or where the movie differs from the novel, as numerious other reviews have already done so.  I think the movie is loyal to the novel where it counts, and that is the courtship of Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett.  Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen breath new life into the characters of Elizabeth and Darcy and they truly inhabit their respective roles.  I particularly liked Macfadyen's Darcy, as he seems much more feeling and would be the kind of person who would inspire the loyalty of his close friends and family as in the novel.  The supporting cast is also excellent and has some of the most beautiful women from accross the pond, including Rosamund Pike and the underused Kelly Reilly.

Having just completed reading the book again yesterday, I wanted to watch this movie to cap it off. For all of the doubters, it truly is a wonderful portrayal of the characters, their over-the-top strengths and weaknesses, and incredible cinematography, which captures Elizabeth Bennett very well. In the book, Elizabeth is supposed to be only 20 years old, and Kiera Knightly brings an excellent zeal and youthfulness to the character, not found in the BBC version. The angst and lovesickness seen in Mr. Darcy is accurate to the writer's wishes, and the absurdity of Lydia, Mrs. Bennett and the girls is portrayed well. The director took a little license with Mr. Bennett's character, making him a little more caring and loving than the book portrays but it adds a nice element to the movie without detracting from the true story line.I loved it!

I'm not going to compare it to the '95 A&E version because this is a 2 hour and 10 minute (or so) version and there are things that couldn't be included, unlike the lengthy '95 P&P.  Keira Knightley did a wonderful job of playing a rather elfin Elizabeth Bennet.  I especially enjoyed her lifted eyebrow as she taunted Darcy.  She represents a youthful Elizabeth Bennet and her youth was a refreshing touch to the character.  Matthew Macfadyen does a good job brooding his way through most of the movie as Mr. Darcy, but he does look a bit silly when he is allowed to show his feelings toward Miss Bennet later in the film. He goes all mushy! (Stick with the glowering, Matthew!)  One of the best touches to the set was that the Bennet's house was surrounded by livestock, dirt, and everyday activities.  It made for a great contrast to Mr. Darcy's home with it's immaculate grounds and perfect furnishings.  This was a wonderful movie, though too short to do full justice to the story.

The point being, that the dresses weren't meant to fit perfectly as they were usually from an older sister's, and were not necessarily the fashion of the time. And yes, even thin strapped dresses like Miss Bingley's Netherfield Ball were around for that time, and was meant to convey how fashionista forward Miss Bingley was. I mean, come on folks, costume designers for these types of movies aren't picked off the street or something! There's usually a game plan invovled that's more detailed and comprehensive than the average viewer gives them credit for.But who cares about clothing-this is a great movie.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3SE17KETOODVV	"B. Sherwood ""paintmehaunted"""	"The mid-90's deluge of Jane Austen adaptations left little room for improvement. The definitive versions of all six of Austen's major novels have already been made, leaving me to wonder why any new adaptations should be made. Movies like ""Bride and Prejudice"" and books like the ""Bridget Jones"" duo (based on ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Persuasion"", respectively) have managed to reexamine the timeless stories with modern infusions of wit, romance, and tragedy.The new ""Pride and Prejudice"", however, offers nothing new except its mediocrity. The fault lies mainly with those behind the cameras, who appear to have do little research into the time period, and with the two main love interests.The costumes and hairstyles are from twenty years before the movie is said to take place (in 1797) and certain musical instruments did not exist in 1797, but these glaring errors and their fellows pale before the complete failure of Matthew MacFayden and Keira Knightley to do justice to their characters. MacFayden, as Darcy, spends his time pouting and being sulky in corners of beautiful houses, and Knightley snarls her way through her scenes as Elizabeth Bennett. Her perfomance was an insult to the character -- Lizzy was never malicious, never cruel, and most of all, never a tomboy. She was firmly a woman who was resigned to her role as such, but was nonetheless clever enough to find ways around her predicted role. Keira Knightley was probably drowning in testosterone from her next abortive cinematic endeavor, ""Domino"".Without any interest in the two main characters, the movie must rely on its secondary characters. Rosamund Pike and Simon Woods as Jane Bennett and Charles Bingley are sweetly romantic; although their love is purposefully bland in its characterisation (the better to clash with Darcy and Lizzy!), their affection for each other is never in doubt. Pike in particular is a lovely, expressive Jane.Judi Dench is a welcome addition to the cast as Lady de Bourgh, Darcy's aristocratic aunt, and as the fluttery Mrs. Bennett, Brenda Blethyn is a quieter, more sympathetic version than the 1996 characterisation. The viewer begins to appreciate her plight: the job of making sure her five daughters make good matches is hers, and she has no money with which to do it. Is it any wonder she's a little crazy?For all intents and purposes, this movie tells the story adequately, but the lackluster, inaccurate production and the leads' lack of acting talent ruin any changes of making this an enjoyable viewing experience. The 1996 version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" remains the standard by which all Austen movies will be judged, and if you can't watch that version, don't believe for an instant that the new, sexed-up, Hollywood-ized version could ever be a decent replacement."	2.0	"Bias aside, this ""Pride and Prejudice"" cannot be allowed."	2005-12-29	25	6	19

Sullivan	"I won't review the movie here, but to summarize, it's a great rendition of the story (though not faithful enough for some).My complaint is with the format of the DVD. The widescreen version (16:9) should include more visual information than the fullscreen version (4:3). This DVD has less. Why?Movies are shot at a wide aspect ratio because movie theatres have screens that are quite a bit wider than conventional TV screens, relative to their height. That's why, when you buy a fullscreen version of a movie on DVD, you'll find that the right and left edges have been cut off. And that's why they have a note at the beginning that says ""This presentation has been modified from the original, it has been reformatted to fit your screen"".Guess what? The widescreen version of this DVD actually cuts off the top and bottom of the fullscreen version to make it fit a wider screen again!? What? Instead of going back to the original widescreen version they actually cut off more of the the (already cut off) regular TV version. What a disappointment...So, if you want to see as much of the fabulous original cinematography, get the fullscreen version.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A378NSRLR49HN6	Bubble Bunny	I realize that time constraints often pose limits on screen writers but my disppointment with this film was not based on what was left out so much as what was put in.As others have expressed before me, the slovenly lifestyle of the Bennets portrayed in this version was a bit of a shock.  The Bennets were not well-to-do, but were comfortable in the book.  Even if those who produced this film thought it necessary to contrast the comparative wealth of Mr. Darcy with the Bennet's lack thereof, there was no need to equate poverty with mess, filth and general lack of attention to cleanliness.The dialogue of the screen writer clashed with the lines adapted from Jane Austen's work.  Elegant phrasing was painfully coupled with modern casual verbage.The characterization of Elizabeth and Jane Bennet should have stood in sharp contrast to those of their sisters and parents.  There was very little distinction between them.Elizabeth was often rude in her behaviors to others rather than spirited and witty.  She was hateful to her mother, aggressively invading Mr. Darcy's space when angry, and generally childish.Mr. Darcy seemed to be more an advertisement for the need of antidepressants than an attitude adjustment.Charlotte Lucas was desperate rather than practical.The comedy that should have been there in Lady Catherine, and Mr Collins was sadly lacking.On the plus side though, I did enjoy how the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet was portrayed with greater warmth than previous versions.  I saw them as much more sympathetic characters.I also thought the scene of Darcy and Elizabeth's awkwardness at their first meeting at his home was also well done.The music and scenery were both lovely.	3.0	Could have been better but it still had a few nice moments	2005-12-01	14	11	3

He's one of my favorite Brits, and I'm quite an Anglophile. However, the miniseries is a six-hour event, and while there are some occasions which allow me that much time, this new version is much easier to handle in one sitting. It touches on all the highest points of the story, and displays a terrific chemistry between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett. In two hours, the viewer is transported to Regency England, with all the gorgeous scenery and beautiful music, where two most favored literary characters fall in love. The direction and cinematography is also much cleaner than the BBC's production, so I enjoy this version for that aspect as well. All in all, whenever I'm craving a delicious story and a unique romance, this is a terrific alternative to the six-hour miniseries.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2GWZR9DWYRQVS	but I HAVE to read...	"I was curious to see this adaptation of the novel as the director chose to place it in the late 1790's when Jane Austen finished her first draft of the story rather than in 1813 when it was finally published.  It was a different time to be sure and the setting is much less pristine than other versions of this story.  However, the filmakers seem to have taken this as artistic license to insert all sorts of confusing anachronisms.For example, there are times when Lizzie publicly visits someone with her hair down.  As a young lady who is ""out"", her hair would  come down only at night and being seen in public with it down would make others perceive her as a little girl.  Lady Catherine the proud and haughty, would not say ""thank you"" to a servant upon receiving a cup of tea, she probably wouldn't even deign to nod in their direction.  And, she certainly wouldn't show up in the dead of night to visit someone.  The most glaring example is Bingly casually showing up in Jane's room while she is sick in bed.  Never, would such a thing happen!Keira Knightly herself is more than a little anachronistic as she is not an actress who hides her modernity well.  She seems entirely too smug with her jutting jaw and toothy grins to be a believable Lizzie.  I thought she was great in ""Bend it Like Beckham"" but she has never been convincing in a period piece, not even ""Pirates"".  Her thinness is painful to behold and would have seemed freakishly unhealthy for that time.Worst of all is that the film has not enough pride and not nearly enough prejudice.  Except for his first scene, Darcy seems more pathetically shy than proud.  You actually feel sorry for him.  Lizzie then, has less to react to with prejudice and with the story of Wickham being so shoddily done, her realization of the depth of her character misjudgements is weak.  There is never that moment where she says, ""and then I knew myself"".Still, the story is strong enough to be salvageable even with this treatment.  The cinematography is lovely too.  I'm just left with the feeling that they figured that American audiences wouldn't be sophisticated to notice all the sloppiness.  We are so often stuck with only action films and insipid comedies that we should be grateful for any substantial period piece.  With Keira Knightly, it wouldn't be languishing on the art house circuit either.  So they mucked it up and tacked on a very silly ending (not there in the British version) and sent it out for sale."	1.0	jarring at times..	2005-12-01	76	55	21

It is Pride and Prejudice done the way the Bronte sisters would have written it. But as a tribute to Jane Austen's ironic masterpiece, it falls far short. How a true Austen fan can enjoy this movie is beyond me. Lizzy is a silly, giggly schoolgirl, and Keira Knightly is badly miscast. So is Matthew MacFadyen, whose Mr. Darcy is more sad and shy than arrogant and conflicted.Major characters and events are cut down to a mere nothing, leaving the story completely undeveloped. Mrs. Bennet is a shadow of the hysterical, nagging matron from the book, while Lizzy is an overwrought, forward young woman who behaves completely outside the boundaries of propriety. Austen would be horrified.There are plenty of historical and literary anomalies for those who know their history and literature. It actually makes me angry and physically ill when I watch it. If you want to see Pride and Prejudice as it was meant to be, watch Andrew Davies' brilliant 1995 miniseries. It is the only proper way to view this story.	1.0	Seriously?	2010-10-06	10	6	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A11Y0Q0DYUNX86	"B. Williams ""B."""	"Now, I have read a lot of the other reviews, and I can appreciate the opinions expressed there. However, I cannot---for even a second---agree that this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is better than the 1995 one. Be that as it may, I did actually like this one for some small things like:1. The scene where Darcy hands Elizabeth into the carriage as she and Jane are leaving Netherfield, and, as he walks away, he has to flex his hand because he can still feel the heat of her touching him. (Very sexy).2. The proposal in the rain, and the sensual, deep look on Darcy's face when she told him no. (Also very sexy).However, these two things do not make up for the SUPREME lack of historical homework done by the writers, producers, costumers, director, etc when coming up with some of these scenes. Knowing as much about the time period as I do, it took me out of the story when scenes would pop up that I know could not have occurred EVER. When you take away the realism of a story, you lose me. Here are a few of the glaring examples:1. Miss Bingley's dress at the Netherfield ball. It looked more like spaghetti straps than an actual ball gown is supposed to look during this time. It is so not historically acurate and I had a hard time not being shocked by it long enough to pay attention what was going on with the story.2. Elizabeth showing up at Netherfield with her hair down around her shoulders. It would not happen, and Elizabeth (the character) would have been mortified to be seen so (especially by people she detested).3. Mr. Bingley coming into Jane's bedroom at Netherfield. I don't care if she was on the verge of dying that very minute, it would never happen.4. Mr. Bennett apologizing and consoling a crying Mary after he ordered her to stop ""exhibiting"" on the piano. This is a serious breach of the character for him. The essence (and fun) of Mr. Bennett is that he is detached (emotionally and usually physically) from his family (except at times from Jane and Elizabeth). He laughs at his wife and younger daughters' opinions, attitudes, and actions because he knows they will always be silly no matter what and it is better laugh and get some entertainment out of it than to get angry over something he can't change. He does not apologize for his actions or caustic words. He just doesn't. Even when Lydia runs off with Wickham, his saddness over his inabilities as a father lasts for about a minute and, by the end of the book, he is back to his old self. He does not apologize. He just doesn't.4. Lady Catherine showing up to confront Elizabeth at night, and Elizabeth (as well as her entire family) receiving her in their nightclothes. Again, none of these things would happen. Not only are both of these things severe breaches of etiquette, but they also are large steps out of character for all involved. (Think of Robin Hood---dressed in MC Hammer's pants---robbing the rich to keep it all for himself. It simply wouldn't happen.)5. Elizabeth walking outside (at the end of the movie) in the dawn in her nightgown. Again, a large breach of etiquette. Elizabeth---no matter how tormented she was about Darcy---would have dressed even before going downstairs, much less outside. Not only would Elizabeth have been embarrassed to find herself this way when she sees Darcy striding over in the distance, but Darcy would have been shocked to see her that way as well.6. Darcy just walking over to her house at the end. Not only is it way too early in the morning for him to be calling, but he comes over partially dressed (with no cravat). Now, let us keep in mind people that this is the staunchest, most prideful, proper character in the history of literature. I don't care how in love he is, he is not going to show up at the house of the woman he adores without getting fully dressed first. Again, it just isn't going to happen.And I wish I could say this is all. Believe me, it isn't, but to put every issue I have on here would take me 12 hours, and I have better things to do. Only know that there are soooo many more. The point is that I do not have a problem with them leaving characters out, shortening the story, leaving out storylines, flattening down characters, etc. But, I cannot buy into a story that cannot be mostly accurate. It would be like watching ""Dances With Wolves"" and having a scene with the Indians stopping in the middle of the buffalo hunt to answer their cellphones. (Believe it or not, some of these breaches are that big.)Therefore, this version just doesn't work for me. I think this is a shame too, because this version could have been so much better if they had only done their homework and made it realistic.B"	1.0	I think we all missed a few things...	2006-01-23	90	55	35
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ABH4G7TVI6G2T	Byron Kolln	"Beautiful cinematography and an Academy Award-nominated performance from Keira Knightley make this newest film version of Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE one to savour.  Although there is a legion of dedicated fans for whom the 1995 BBC miniseries (with Colin Firth) is still the definitive screen treatment, director Joe Wright (with a screenplay by Deborah Moggach and Emma Thompson) invests this version with a youthful feel and a slightly earthy, grittier edge.  Most importantly, Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen (as Darcy) are very close in age to what Austen describes in the novel.Headstrong and opinionated Elizabeth Bennet's rocky road to romance with the ""insufferably proud"" Mr Darcy plays out it's course against Austen's web of family intrigue and social mores. The colourful gallery of supporting players includes Brenda Blethyn as the social-climbing Mrs Bennet, Rosamund Pike as Jane, Jena Malone as Lydia, Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet, Kelly Reilly as Miss Bingley, Tom Hollander as Mr Collins and Dame Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourg (a role she was born to play).While the Austen novel, with all it's incidents and well-crafted story, is better suited to the luxurious running-time of a miniseries, this new version is, on the whole, very enjoyable and fans of the Austen works will surely love it."	4.0	Austen's story given the grand treatment	2006-04-09	13	8	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2BZICRHTY9GWH	calamity jane	I am an avid Jane Austen fan.  Pride and Prejudice along with Mansfield Park happen to be my favorites and thus it is important for a movie to get it right.  We all know and love the BBC 6 part version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth and is the Austen adaptation standard but this version is a pleasant surprise.  I want to clear one thing up before I continue this review.  There have been other viewers who bemoan this version.  They do so on the belief Darcy's first proposal takes place at Pemberley instead of Rosings.  The proposal actually takes place at Rosings if you are paying attention.  Alright, I am off my horse and on to the review.  The cast is exceptional.  The characters are portrayed well  and the chemistry between them is wonderful.  Of course there are characters and subplots that are underdeveloped but you can't expect exact character and subplot representation in a 2 hour movie. Too be honest my only complaint about this version is it just isn't long enough.  I would have loved to see a 6 part version produced with this cast not to replace the BBC version but to compliment it.  I think it would have been brilliant.	5.0	a nice little rendition	2013-04-24	2	1	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1KBBC3RC7JPMC	"Calder Falk ""CRF"""	"I know many people will disagree with this review because I already saw the multitude of positive responses about this movie, but this is not Austen. There may be nothing wrong with the acting, but the story is too frothy and thin to do justice to the real wit and complexity of Jane Austen's novel. The main actors, especially Elizabeth and her family are two-dimensional pop versions of the novel. The family has been turned into ""Little House on the Prairie"" characters without richness or intricacy. In the novel (and in the A & E mini-series), the father was a man who hid from his duties and obligations to his family because he was bitterly disappointed in his choice of wife. Dazzled by her beauty and societal airs, he realised after their marriage that she was childish, superficial and self-absorbed. Although he is learned, perceptive and capable and despite the fact that he cares for his two eldest daughters, he fails to do what is right by his family; he refuses to establish rules of conduct or attempt to mould his daughters into moral adults with compassion and integrity and despite her affection for her father, is a constant source of embarrassment for Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth's shame about her parents that creates her defensive 'pride' which clashes with Darcy's proud demeanour. It is really Darcy's stiffness and lack of easy social skills that masquerades as pride just as Elizabeth's attitude is also a cover. Both of their external facades create prejudice against perceived slights and causes the delightful sparks between the two. The father and mother in this movie are all sweetness and light. if you enjoy slight romantic comedy than I guess you might like this movie, but if you want breadth and scope of character, a revealing insight into the society and mores of 18th century Britain and a damn good read, then I suggest you start with the novel itself. If you prefer a visual version, then I would recommend the A & E  series as it is the most faithful to the original with only minor deviations. Both are extremely delightful and there is no substitute for Austen's sparkling wit."	2.0	Pop version of Pride & Prejudice	2010-06-01	14	11	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3UYDJLYVS6GQX	"C. A. Lemley ""Cal"""	The reviewers who gave this film low marks are entitled to their opinion as I am entitled to mine. The initial urge to criticize this film dissipated after glancing at a quick second showing. It is not required that a movie be perfect in order for it to be perfected within itself given the constraints of various limitations. Those who cry foul and point to inaccurate text mirroring or cite smidglings of literary discrepancies seem to have bones too stiff for enjoyment. Although it is possible (usually in most films it is not only possible, but probable, that different actors may have carried success to further extreme - or inversely, failure), it seems pointless to snivel about it. We have these actors - these particular combinations - no others. This film came into a life of its own and spoke well to the human condition. The acting, overall, was excellent and in several instances phenomenal. Quite a wonderful pleasure. We would certainly be the poorer without it.	4.0	Excellent	2006-04-24	20	15	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1YMZDIJ65A5RK	Calix Vincent	"I must say I've watched this more times than I can count, and so it's safe to say I'm in love with this film. But there are a few details that need to be touched upon if you're considering this film.-Book to Film-For two hours of time, I think this film did a decent job of translating Austen's work into a film format. Because of everything that happens, however, I don't think I would've minded if an additional half-hour had been added. A lot more could've been touched on and explained. ""What do you mean, explained?"" See the next section.-Warning to P&P; Unfamiliars!-I can watch this film and see why some people who have never read P&P; or watched any other film adaptations would be wondering, ""What's up with Lizzy and Darcy anyway?""Truly, you see more of everything else than you do of them, which could lead those unfamiliar with the story to wonder why Elizabeth wanted much to do with Darcy in the end. I don't think that their relationship was developed as much as it needed to be, and it might make people wonder why Lizzy and Darcy ended up in love at all.-Characters and Actors-I was skeptical about Keira Knightley, as she didn't fit my picture of Elizabeth Bennet, but she surprised me and gave Lizzy a wonderfully fiery character that I enjoyed very much. I rather liked Matthew Macfadyen as Mr Darcy, and especially loved the almost boyish aspect he brought to the character--I felt it made Darcy much more realistic and even likeable. Great talent is always needed in the role of Mr Darcy, and Macfadyen definitely has that. The actors do quite well with body language--sharp eyes notice this is a prominent thing in this film, and it indeed speaks volumes.-In Conclusion-I think this is a fresh and unique take on Pride and Prejudice, and being a great fan, I welcomed that. Small details, such as the 'grunge' feel of the Bennet household, made this film more realistic rather than giving me yet another Austen ""fairy tale perfection"" film. The music and imagery gave me this near-surreal or -fantastical feel that I especially love. Once again, however, I would warn someone not familiar with Pride and Prejudice to watch this film with someone who is! They'll be better able to acquaint you with the language, social behaviours, and the dynamics of the story itself.Overall, a fantastic and wonderfully novel take on Pride and Prejudice!"	4.0	A wonderfully fresh take	2006-03-29	12	7	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AAU853VMIUJ3E	Callie Newsome	I have an almost love/hate relationship with this movie.  I love that there is a new take on it and some of the more youthful feeling characters in this adaptation.  What I hate about it is how much they leave out.  One of the biggest and most emotional part in the book is Kitty's elopement, and in this movie it lasts for about 2 minutes and seems of almost no importance. If you have never read the book or have seen the BBC version, I highly reccomend this to you as a movie.

Now I think that version has more details of the book, BUT there is also a big difference when you have 6 hours to tell a story vs 2 hours. Compare apples to apples.I loved the leads in this film. Matthew & Kiera brought such a youthful, freshness to the roles of Darcy & Lizzy, which fit more with the traditional characters and their ages. I could see & feel Lizzie falling in love with Darcy rather than just accepting she was wrong about him & his character. I thought they had great chemistry on screen. I didn't mind the changes made, it is after all an adaptation. They kept all the main themes & motifs of the original tale & that's what is important to me.The other principles chewed the scenery equally well, particularily the actress who portayed Mrs. Bennet. Loved her! Donald Sutherland, Tom Hollander, & Judi Dench--no words can do these people justice.The look of the film is exquisite & the music is extraordinary. A very entertaining two hours.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A365P95IM9UM17	Caroline M Bentley	"Just awful. The Bennett family is portrayed as low rent trash living in a grimy, disheveled house. including a pig being led through the house. Jane Austen's Bennett family was provincial but had a throughly respectable living situation. They were gentry not hillbillies. Keira Knightly uses her usual set of smirks and grimaces to portray Elizabeth Bennett's agile mind. Bendy lips do not convey wit. Matthew MacFadden is too old for Darcy and Keira Knightly. Keira Knightly acts like a spoiled and head strong young teenager not a complex, captivating and independent thinking young woman. Austen's Lizzy is nowhere to be found. It makes Darcy look like a bit of a creep when he ardently confesses his love for the adolescent acting Lizzy. Even worse is the ""romantic"" ending when Darcy  further expresses his love for the newly wed Elizabeth. Keira Knightly returns his coy drivel with all the giggly enthusiasm of a schoolgirl crush. The scene feels like we are eavesdropping on a teacher who has run off with his student.The technical aspects of the film are even worse. Poorly written dialoque, abrupt advances in the storyline  make the plot confusing and unconvincing. The only saving grace is the beautiful photography.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2C3AMW04ZKGYR	Caroline Sample	Not having read the book I was skeptical of watching a movie with romance. Usually, the terrible acting and the sappiness will send me to the fridge out of boredom or leave me dead asleep on the couch. Although this may result in a good nights sleep, I can't help but to think the three dollars I invested was put to waste. But maybe through Elizabeth Bennet's (Keira Knightley) class or Mr. Darcy's sideburns, Pride and Prejudice seemed like less of a loss and more of an investment. So much so that I'll confess to owning it on amazon.The story-plot just can't go wrong. It starts out with a town dance hosting all citizens in the town. Word spreads that a certain Mr. Darcy and his friend Mr. Bingley are to attend, so the house full of excited sisters, one of them being Elizabeth Bennet make there way. Mr. Darcy, unlike what was expected is cold, standoffish, and somewhat arrogant. This results in Elizabeth being stubborn and spiteful towards him. But through time his affections change and small hints of such feelings are shown. Moments such as his nervous hand after helping her into the carriage made me squeal out of excitement. As well the scene in which he appears out of the forrest wearing a low buttoned shirt with slight chest hair popping, stuttering while professing his love to her, has me not grabbing for chips, but instead looking for a Kleenex.I love and hate this movie for it's one of my favorite films but also leaves me looking for my Mr. Darcy. Lowering my chances even more making me particular. Now all I look for in a man is his ability to be able to pull off sideburns while wearing a cape.

Directed by Joe Wright and screenwritten by Deborah Moggach, this is the most visually arresting and artistic of the ""Pride & Prejudice"" films.  The strength of the other versions has always been the dialogue. This is the first version which trusts the camera and imagery and lets the luminosity of the story line shine through rather than talking straight through it. The actors in this version are also a who's who of British acting. There is the young and impudent incandesence of Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet. She is the prejudiced one against the wealth and position of the young man who initially finds her too inferior to even be his dance partner.  This is Mr. Darcy as played by Matthew Macfadyen.  I was used to him as the head spy on MI-5 so he is maybe the last actor I would have cast as Darcy. However, I didn't realize how versatile an actor he is.  He is fabulous as Darcy, the one who suffers from pride in his origins, his convictions, his family and his property.  Elizabeth is beneath him so how could he fall in love with her?

Shifflett ""cmshifflett"""	"Stunning photography and highly imaginative scripting and casting: Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennet) is especially striking in his clear familial and sartorial resemblance to great-great-grandson Buddy Ebson (Jed Clampett), before the family left England (possibly due to some unspeakable behavior involving pigs) and moved to the New World where they acquired more polish and class, rising in American society to the beautiful mountains of Kentucky.The director has wisely smoothed out Austen's complex characters and overly involved plot to a level more suitable to modern sensibilities and tastes; for moderns challenged by the complexities of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" or Harlequin novels, this tender tale provides all the depth, subtlety, and brilliant crafting of a Barbara Cartland Romance.Stars are subtracted from this otherwise lovely film as an issue of Truth In Labeling, with potential confusion to the consumer. It is common for artists producing a work ""Based On"" a classic work (but bearing little resemblance to the original) to give their work a fitting alternate name. For example, a stirring tale ""based on"" ""Homer's Oddysey"" might become ""O, Brother Where Art Thou"" or it might become ""Cold Mountain."" The novel ""based on Jane Austin's ""Emma"" has become ""Clueless"" and her ""Pride and Prejudice"" has become ""Bridget Jones' Diary.""

It has followed us through the centuries of time, interacting, for better or worse, with every aspect of mankind, poor and rich alike.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1YSQNRAVSHI26	Carolyn S. Hodges	"This is a wonderful story. Pride and Prejudice is a classic that has inspired, interested and entertained young women for years, and henceforth has been made into many movies. Amazingly, each one has tried to represent the complete and prominent beauty of this story, but none has succeeded completely, because they are either too long, or too short. Until now. In the 2005 version, (w) starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, one will be swept away in the world of Jane Austen and be kept tucked away in its arms. Being the re-representation of Pride and Prejudice the book, themovie keeps close to the original and only veers away to emphasize and enhance it, since modern people are harder to please. When one watches this video they will see a wonderful and picturesque world that will fly them away from reality and into a world of romance and ""Happily Ever After."" Nothing beats this tale.All is quiet as Elizabeth Bennet walks through the fields in the early morning, book in hand. Unfortunately, that does not last. Even as she steps up onto the steps of her home, she hears the chattering of her sisters and the shrewish voice of her mother. ""Mr. Bennet, have you not heard? Netherfield Park is let at last, do you not wish to know who has taken it?"" ""As you wish to tell me my dear, I doubt I have much choice in the matter."" He replied tiredly. Spotting her sisters, Elizabeth hurried towards them. ""Lydia, Kitty, what have we said about listening at the door."" But they quickly hush her, and inform her that a young and rich man, (w) named Mr. Bingley was moving in just up the road. ""He's single."" They gasped, and instantly Jane, the eldest sister was pulled into the conversation. ""Who's single?"" the conversation continued in the other room. ""How could that possibly effect them?"" their father rumbled. ""Oh, Mr. Bennet, how can you be so tiresome, you know he must marry one of them."" Stifling giggles the four girls leaned in closer, since the conversation has just gotten interesting. Just then the door opened and Mr. Bennet himself stepped out, not at all surprised to see his daughters listening in. Then all of them pursue him through the house, because they are trying to convince him to visit the man. As they pass her, the girls pull Mary up from her piano stool and into the living room with them. ""For your information,"" Mr. Bennet said finally, cutting them off, ""I already have."" ""You have?"" and again they began to bombard him with questions, this time about the man's character. ""So will he come to the ball then Papa?"" Lydia finally asks breathlessly and eagerly. ""I believe so."" In an instant, temperaments go from concerned to overjoyed and preparations begin immediately for creating the best appearance to catch the eye of the young man.  Elizabeth just laughs and thinks about how fast a quiet morning can turn into one of such frivolity.The ball was such a mix of sounds that it was almost impossible to hear anything, even though Elizabeth was sitting right next to her sister Jane and her best friend Charlotte. ""If all of the men in the room don't end the evening in love with you then I am no judge of beauty,"" she told Jane, but she was only answered with a laugh and retort, ""Or men."" ""No, they are far too easy to judge."" The lady laughed, looking at the room full of middle society folk, all enjoying themselves immensely. ""They're not all bad."" Jane reproved scanning the faces for Mr. Bingley. ""Poppycocks in my limited experience."" ""One of these days Lizzy, someone's going to catch your eye and then you're going to have to watch your tongue."" Charlotte agreed with a knowing look, because she knew her friend well. Not much later, the doors blew open revealing three people who looked both rich and self absorbed. Instantly, the room fell silent as the figures strode through the room, since they were imposing figures. ""Which one of the painted peacocks is our Mr. Bingley?"" Lizzy asked her friend. ""He's on the left,"" in secret she looked at the ginger haired young man and decided that he wasn't so bad. He was smiling at the crowd genially and nodding at different people. ""And on the right is his sister."" Again her eyes scanned the woman and concluded that if any words could be used for her, they would be proud, attention seeking and prejudiced. ""And the person with the quizzical brow?"" she finally inquired. ""That is his good friend Mr. Darcy."" ""He looks miserable poor soul."" ""Miserable he may be, but poor he most certainly is not."" Sweeping the crowd, his eyes found hers as she rose from her curtsy and he hastily turned his gaze back to the front. Finally, Sir William Lucus, Charlotte's father stepped forward and greeted them. Elizabeth believed he was proud. After that, chaos ensued at the party again with all its noise and clamor.The family's simple plan of uniting Mr. Bingley to Jane for an advantageous marriage becomes more and more complex as Mr. Collins, the cousin who is to inherit everything that belongs to the girls, shows up with a determination to marry one of them. At around the same time Mr. Wickham steps into the scene and practically sweeps Elizabeth off her feet in one sentence, because he is witty and charming. But Mr. Darcy isn't done with her either, since she has already caught his eye. Suddenly the stubborn Elizabeth finds herself being twirled around in a spinning love-go-round. Being young, being stubborn and being love sick she is confused with the two stories spun for her, concerning the connection of Darcy and Wickham. Who is telling the truth? When faced with the choice, which man will she eventually marry? Will her sisters end up in poverty or will they have advantageous marriages too?In order to find out, in order to learn more, and in order to see the beauty for oneself, one must watch the movie or even read the very book. Pride and Prejudice is a complex story that will be a treasure for all young ladies adding to their collection. Not only is it entertaining, but it is a sweet and clean chick flick that stands above all the rest, which is saying a lot. The directors did a wonderful job of keeping it close enough to the book that anyone can read it afterwards and still not be disappointed, but still making it appealing to the teen crowd. Many young women can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it, because one can catch different things when it is watched more. It is a comfort movie. Being full of wonderful music, people can buy the soundtrack or even the piano book to keep the beauty in their home. Finally, many lessons can be learned from this story since people learn never to judge on appearances and to love one's family even through thick and thin. Since it is a terrific tale of truth Pride and Prejudice is a movie a family will want to watch again and again."	5.0	A story above the rest	2007-05-14	8	4	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A22EH5K9O1GLY8	Caryn214	I really really really like the 6 hour Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth (or is it Furth?).  Anyway, I didn't have 6 hours to spend watching, so I chose this video on my Kindle Fire.  It downloaded great and was really easy to watch.  It is a bit different from the 6 hour P&P but oh so definitely good.  I have a hard time following the book.  What can I say?  Maybe it was my public education.  So the 6 hour Colin Firth series helped tremendously but this movie is a good substitute for that one. I enjoyed the actors and how they portrayed the characters.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AN158UVJV2SM0	cassberday	"Pride and Prejudice by Jane AustenThematically the story slowly builds and leaves the reader at multiple climaxes throughout the book, first with the introduction of Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley at the town ball. Then leaving the reader hanging with the decision of Mr. Bingley to hold a ball and share his feelings to Jane all to have him leave based on the advice of Mr. Darcy. The book takes the reader on a rollercoaster to keep the hope continuing and keep things interesting.The tension between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie is unremarkable, whether it be her interest for him at the ball but him clearly ignoring her because he thinks that he's too far above her socially. In the end she has too much pride to accept his love once he declares it for her. They can barley stand seeing each other after that but she misses his attention and affection and soon realizes what a good man he is and soon addresses her love for Mr. Darcy once she finds out everything he did for Lydia and also convinced Mr. Bingley to return and ask for Jane's hand in marriage.Elizabeth's obvious hatred of the privileged gives way to her pride and lets it get in the way when she realizes that she is starting to have feelings for him. Her character seems rather angry in her own way and even a little bitter that has a woman she has to marry someone in order to not be a burden on her family. This really gives the reader a window into the independence that she wants to have and how torn she is to give in to her independence if she declares her love for Mr. Darcy.I agree with all the reviews of pride and prejudice but I wish the first one would have elaborated on the two different views of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth who both realize they love each other when the other does not at that point in time. That their pride and attitude get in the way because they don't want to give the wrong impression and she is always so witty and intellectually superior. However, they are correct in the way that Mr. Darcy still tries to show is love in secret just because he wants Elizabeth to be happy and have no problems in her life.Jane Austen still is really summed up in ""let it be yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of you"" representing his never ending love for Elizabeth even knowing she had said she did not feel the same way prior to this discovery. I love this quote because it just shows his hope that maybe she loves him back so he must tell her how he feels. It represents his passion and shiverlious behavior in order to just make life easier for her.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance novel, the setting of the novel and the independence of a fierce young woman fighting her own feelings is thrilling and makes the read even better."	5.0	Pride and Prejudice Review	2013-01-21	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3SUD7WHS9KI57	Cassie W.	"Okay, I admit it:  I went into watching Joe Wright's 2005 adaptation of PRIDE & PREJUDICE with some trepidation, for a couple of reasons. 1.) Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of my favorite novels, and I didn't want to see Austen's story metamorphose into something it wasn't on the big screen.  And 2.) I am a huge fan of the BBC version, so I felt I had a lot to compare this new adaptation of the film to--and could it measure up to the high standards set by Austen and the BBC film (and Colin Firth's performance, in particular)?  The answer to that question, I discovered after seeing it, is, as Jane Bennet would say, ""Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!""PRIDE & PREJUDICE tells the story of the Bennet family in rural England during the late 1700s.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five daughters of the marrying age and, with no son to carry on the family name, the anxious Mrs. Bennet (played brilliantly by Brenda Blethyn) is desperate to get her daughters married off to the richest, most eligible young suitors.  Enter Mr. Bingley, who has just bought a large property near the Bennet home, and who at once becomes entranced with the eldest Miss Bennet, Jane.  He brings Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden), his haughty and even richer friend, with him to the country.  Darcy immediately clashes with the next eldest Bennet sister, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley).  Elizabeth is strong-willed, opinionated, and prideful, and she resents Darcy's condescending air and haughty attitude. Darcy resents Elizabeth's low rank in society and lewd family.  A series of chance encounters, however, gradually begin to change their opinions of one another--but both Darcy and Elizabeth have too much ""pride and prejudice"" to admit to their attraction and give in to the love of their lives.Austen-ite purists beware:  Wright (and screenwriter Deborah Moggach) have taken liberties with the film.  The Elizabeth and Darcy we see on screen are younger than Austen's version of the characters.  The story takes place in the more rural England of the 1790's, rather than in the early 19th century of Austen's novel.  The roles of many characters are reduced for the purpose of moving the story along; some are left out altogether.  But an adaptation is supposed to take liberties, right?  We know the story of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE; we've read the book, we've seen the BBC adaptation (which was very faithful to the novel); in my opinion, it's about time we got a fresh take on Austen's timeless classic.And Wright does a brilliant job with this adaptation.  This version lacks the romanticized costuming and setting of the BBC film, which felt and looked like a period piece.  The presentation of this version is much more gritty, much more natural; the gowns are plain, the country is muddy and rainy.  The love between Elizabeth and Darcy is innocent, vibrant, making them even more unbalanced, and they are even more powerless to resist each other.  The music is understated and simple, the perfect compliment to a story of overwhelming, irresistable love.And the acting is absolutely superb.  Keira Knightley is a natural actress, surprisingly powerful in her portrayal of strong-willed Elizabeth Bennet.  I was a little bit concerned she'd be too young for the role (and too beautiful to play Elizabeth)--but she blew me away with her forceful performance.  It's no wonder she was nominated for an Oscar for this role!  And Matthew Macfayden--although Colin Firth he is not, but who is?--is brilliant as the haughty, decorous, discreet Mr. Darcy.  And the two have tons of chemistry.  Dame Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland are welcome additions to the cast in small but memorable roles.There are two scenes, in particular, that I thought were particularly well done.  The scene in which Elizabeth visits Pemberley and wanders around Darcy's home, touching his sculptures and admiring his beautiful belongings, is particularly telling.  You can feel Elizabeth's feelings evolving at that moment, and the score is particularly well-utilized in this scene.  The other scene is the one in the moor, early in the morning, when Darcy comes to Elizabeth out of the mist.  Sounds corny, but it's simply beautiful:  The two young actors convey so much, without really saying anything at all.  The fabricated ending is sweet and lovely, too.One thing Wright doesn't change about Austen's story is the main message her long-ago novel contained, a message that is still pertinent today:  True love transcends all boundaries of class and pride.  So I have to say my trepidation was groundless.  All in all, this version of PRIDE & PREJUDICE is a worthy update to Austen's timeless romance.  The only thing I really missed was Colin Firth in the wet white shirt--but we can't always have it all, can we?"	5.0	"""You have bewitched me, body and soul"""	2006-03-15	17	12	5

The movie departs from the book, and the editing and script do not give enough time or substance to fully develop the characters.

I'm an Austen lover, and a big fan of Colin Firth in the original A&E; miniseries version of this novel, so I was initially hesistant to watch this film; it's always disappointing to see one of your favorite books turned into a pathetic story on film.  And honestly, I didn't think Knightley had the chops to bring Elizabeth Darcy to life.  But I'm delighted that I watched (and ended up buying) this film, because its one of the best book-to-movie adaptations I have ever seen.Not only did the actors beautifully capture the spirit of their characters and represent their internal struggles realistically, but the director clearly had a brilliant appreciation for the spirit of the original text.  The imagery of the film is often dark, and the director managed to underscore the difficulties of poverty and womanhood in 19th century England with great poignancy.  While other directors of Austen films often focus on the comedy and lighthearted romance of Austen's stories, this movie captures Austen's spirit of satire without detracting from the plot.Whether you are an Austen fan or a movie fan or both, this is a great film.	5.0	A Bronte-ian Austen film	2006-06-23	10	5	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3VIOCJZ22JZXT	C. B Collins Jr.	"This is a beautiful version of the classic Jane Austin novel Pride and Prejudice. the actors and actresses are beautiful and the English countryside glows golden at sun rise and sun set. There are three aspects of the film that I will point out tht make it wonderful entertainment.First, Elizabeth Bennett is one of the great characters in English literature. Here she is played as more impulsive than Jennifer Ehle plays the part in the great BBC version. For example, beautiful Kiera Knightley plays Elizabeth as young, playful, and inclined to romance, as evidenced by her reactions to Mr. Darnley at the country house dance at the beginning of the film. Jennifer Ehle pays Elizabeth Bennett as more reserved, more mature, and more sphnix-like. The strength of Elizabeth Bennett is that she is witty, intelligent, considerate, and willing to change her mind. It is this last quality, the willingness to changer her mind, on which much of the film revolves. Elizabeth's first impression of Mr. Darnley was that whereas he was rich and handsome, he was also arrogant and prideful an maybe even a little cruel. Eventually, through a series of mishaps and interactions, she begins to see him differently, seeing his strenghts and compassion and convictions and most of all, his love for her despite the tensions and misunderstandings they undergo.The scene where Darnley proposes to Elizabeth despite his low regard for her wild family and her poverty was wonderfully played in this film, with Kiera Knightley firing back at him that his poorly worded proposal of marriage was the height of insult to her and her family.Yet these two weather this upsetting event and go on to love each other greatly as they further discover each other's best qualities. Isn't this what love should really be about? Shouldn't we move from erotic first impressions to deeper appreciation and understanding of each other?Second, Darnley is well played here. Colin Firth does such an exceptional job in the BBC version that it was hard for me to warm up to another Mr. Darnley, but this actor gives us a version of Darnley that is more mysterious and less aristocratic than the Firth version.Third, Jane Austin creates a charming world full of odd, delighful, endearing, and yet realistic characters. Jane Bennett is the height of beauty and sweetness, no wonder Mr. Bingley falls madly in love. Mr. Bingley is as silly as he is rich, however he is sincere and is a perfect match for Jane. Mr. Bingley's sister is wonderfully played and I loved the line she speaks at the country dance where she wonders when the guests will stop dancing and chase pigs. Lydia Bennett is such an empty headed young women, not realizing how her elopement could ruin the reputations of her sisters. Mr. Collins is such a fool, basing his self worth on the whims of his wealthy benefactor, Lady de Bourge. Judi Dench plays a great angry scheming Lady de Bourge. Mr. Bennett says in the book: ""God placed us here on earth to laugh at our neighbor's folly and for our neighbor in turn to laugh at ours."" This line wonderfully represents Austin's philosophy which she brings to all her characters.The acting is super and truly romantic, the English countryside is beautifuland moody, and the novel actually can be revealed in a short two hours, which I could not believe until I saw it."	4.0	Very good updated version of a wonderful classic	2005-11-29	10	6	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3041U51FTGQ7E	C.B.	seriously, it's an adaptation, I am sick of people reviewing it based on the book. If they wanted to make the book into a movie, they would have. This is supposed to give the director and screenwriter's view on the story, it's not meant to be exact. Study French new wave and maybe some would understand why it is done this way(basically books should not be made into movies, there should be a screenplay made for film, not the exact book because they are two seperate arts. A book cannot have the same effect on film, it needs to be changed. Look at movies like the DaVinci Code, that is how not to do it)I think the film captured the spirit of the story and characters. The front page reviews express my feelings on the film. Mcfayden was an amazing Darcy and the chemistry and passion of the film was amazing. I am OBSESSED with Pride and Prejudice, and though there are many encounters in the book that I would have enjoyed having knightly and Mcfayden act out because they were so good, I understand the vision the director had. Making it in that manner made it far more passionate then my former favorite, the A&E; version. There were scenes that could be watched over and over. The filming was beautiful, and certain scenes lookedlike paintings. Some differences from the book and Austen I believe were made to help understand the story and the feelings, such as the hug between Darcy and his sister. It shows the love between them because we have no narator.The casting was amazing, I do feel that the characters were more convincing in this version(thank god Jane was cast much better in this than in the A&E; version). I think Judi Dench was perfect along with Jena Malone, and actually every other cast member.I am happy though that many people watched it without expecting or only accepting Jane Austen's vision, because you cannot make a film from a vision that is not your own. Jane Austen is not here to make her own, so I will enjoy the adaptations not basing them on how closely they follow the book.	5.0	Beautiful ADAPTATION	2007-07-14	5	2	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3QEA8PDZUWYG4	C. Blair	Wider screen compared to the original DVD version which is cropped. Visual detail is also better as one would expect from a blu-ray version.As for comparison to the 1995 version, I love both, but there are people who claim the 1995 version is vastly superior. It seems most often that they love Colin Firth in his wet shirt which has nothing to do with the novel but it seems to incite some feminine imaginations. The BBC version is not without its faults, but the leads are very strong and the series/running time is longer and thus captures more of the Austen wit. The 2005 version's cast is uniformly stronger and being a movie, the production values are thus naturally stronger (better visually and musically). Judged on its own as a movie, the 2005 version is visually striking and its music score is worth a purchase on it's own merits.You can't go wrong with either version really.	5.0	The Blu-ray version is better visually	2010-04-13	4	3	1

If you weren't familiar with the book or BBC version, you might get lost.  I thought the character developement could have been better.  But all in all, Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen are a great couple in this movie.  Their glances and small gestures are perfect.  I love one of the very last scenes where Mr. Darcy is walking towards her and the camera stays on him the whole way.  I thought the cinematography was wonderful.

At first one is compelled to think that it is not correct in its adaptation.  My personal thoughts are that it captures the ""feelings"" of the characters and allows them to portray them much more than a literal telling of the story would.  And indeed it does not add anything not in the book, it on some things rearranges the location of an event."	4.0	Great!	2008-02-08	2	2	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3JRH10VFHIKS7	C. D. Lord	I dont know about others, but I love Keira Knightly! This movie has been done with others playing that role, but Knightly takes it to another level, completely. She is truly Elizabeth Bennett. If you like movies about the rich and richer, you will love this movie. The music score is enlightening and many of the scenes are set in a richer person's house. All the characters blend quite well to make this movie a must see event. The Bennett family is interesting, funny, and sometimes annoying but true to the time and circumstance of their position in life. Watch and engulf yourself in all it has to offer.	5.0	Pride and Prejudice	2009-12-28	5	3	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AZVR9CW5SBCZI	CDN	I've seen different versions of Pride and Prejudice, including the versions with Laurence Olivier and Colin Firth.  None come close to this version.  Even though story had to be condensed to fit the runtime of the movie, the integrity of the story remains.  Keira Knightly is powerful as Elizabeth and Matthew Macfadyen IS the ultimate Darcy.  Donald Sutherland, Judi Dench and Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins are also masterful. The musical score outstanding!  This is a must see!  This is an update.  I don't know how I managed to leave out Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennett.  She was wonderful.	5.0	The Real Darcy and Elizabeth	2010-08-17	5	3	2

The movie works only if the viewer knows nothing about Jane Austen, has never seen the BBC classicc (I highly, highly, recommend this), and likes Keira Knightley.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2U5K5WNTJWQF2	Celestial Lady	I own both versions of this story and love both of them. However, if I had to choose between them, this would be the one I'd pick. The interplay between Elizabeth and Darcy is breathtakingly intense from their first glances and their inner struggles are shown clearly on their faces, unlike the greater restraint shown in the longer BBC version. The whole thing is much more cinematic than the latter, also, and the ballroom scene where everyone but Elizabeth and Darcy disappears for a moment is but one of many masterful touches throughout the movie. It does not follow the book as well as the BBC version does, but somehow it fleshes it out and redeems it for the 21st Century. Excellent in every respect except that I can't seem to get enough of watching it! :-)	5.0	Absolutely glows!	2007-03-02	9	7	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1LHT3203NJH9O	Celine Deux	This 2005 adaptation of Jane Austen's novel was beautifully portrayed and characterized by a fine British cast; I highly recommend this film for the whole family.Loved Keira Knightly, whom I have seen in a few films, and thought her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett was magnificent, with a touch of today's young, knows-her-own-mind, woman.  As for Matthew Macfayden (Mr. Darcey), whom I have never seen in film, was the dashing, brooding, romantic figure of a young girl's dream.  I much preferred his Mr. Darcey, to Colin Firth's.The music, piano solo, is especially a dream for the ears and the cinematography is breathtaking!In short, I loved this film which has made a Jane Austen fan out of me.	5.0	Pride & Prejudice the DVD	2013-03-23	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3CPDCR3C36O8B	ceventatem	This is a wonderful ADAPTATION of the story of Darcy and Lizzy, very well made with beautiful music, scenery and artsy segues. I would recommend anyone unfamiliar with this story to NOT watch this movie first. It is a nice, bite size version that can best be appreciated when watched with a prior understanding of the characters and the story (as it hacks the actual story to pieces). First, of course, see the '95 version (and read the book!).My praise: Artsy, artsy, artsy! If you listen to the commentary, the director really knew the story and was NOT trying to blatantly follow the book (as we all know, that has been done with perfection, so why try?). He was trying to bring fresh thought and feeling to it and, though I don't agree with a lot of the re-writing of the lines, I applaud the way he alluded to the windows being a metaphor for perception, the way the sunrise opened and closed the story, the setting being 100 years prior to the actual setting of the book, the domestic abuse of Lydia by Wickham (which we all suspected), the little character nuances and sub-plots that took place in the background of every scene (you gotta be quick!), and the romance he could achieve with scenery and music, when no action was taking place. Oo! Simply beautiful! So much more than simply telling the same old tale! And the first-proposal scene! Nice!My rant: I felt this version blew thru the actual story perhaps a little too fast. Much of the wit for which Jane Austen is so well known is NOT done justice. Lines from the book which ARE left intact are spewed with little thought or acting, especially in the beginning. Sometimes so fast that, if I wasn't familiar with the dialogue, I would've had no idea what was going on. And character development? What's that?I was not infatuated with Knightley as Miss Lizzy. She lacked the playfulness and intrigue of her character. She had some of the best lines, yet constantly disappointed me in their delivery. Plus, she always looked disheveled and sticky to the touch. And the teeth on Mr. Bennet! Such pearly, straight choppers for a poor man in 1790! They are blinding amidst all the gloom. C'mon makeup guy, try a little harder!However, Macfadyen was wonderful as Darcy and I wish he had more scenes to better explain his character. I feel he could've done it justice. And Lady Catherine? Perfection!I really expected this to throw out ALL the wit and plot and turn this into some sickly, thin love story that would appeal to idiots everywhere (the 2 hours run time scared me). However, it did not. Some wit remained, all the high points were addressed and there was many a scene where Knightley and Macfadyen had fantastic chemistry. In the end, though, it just wasn't there for me. A little cheesy/sappy perhaps.My ideal P&P; would be somewhere between this and the '95 one. I LOVE the romantic artsy-ness this one brings to the table, yet the '95 version is faultless in it's story. Oh well, maybe the next version will be better.Should you buy this one? Of course! A new take on a great story is always appreciated! However, I would recommend the WS version, as the director has a lot of shots with characters on extreme R and L, and they are uncomfortably close to the edges of the screen on the FS version. Plus, WS will do the beautiful, sweeping wide-angle scenery better justice.	4.0	Wonderful Adaptation...'95 Still Better!	2006-03-05	16	12	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AOGL01DU0U1GW	C. Griffin	"I rarely enjoy a movie as much as I did this one. It is wonderful on so many levels. It is a simply lovely movie about a great love story.I have found some of the reviews posted for this movie very interesting, especially those that complain about this adaptation not being true enough to the book. I am also fascinated by the comparisons to Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy. What gives?I am, perhaps, an experienced enough movie-goer that I didn't expect to see the book visually transferred to the screen. If I want to relive the story Jane Austen wrote, verbatim, I will read the book again.And, as much as I admire Colin Firth, I am so impressed with Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy. His portrayal in this version is subtle and beautiful. Mr. Darcy seems more real than in any previous version thanks to the sensitivity and sensibilities in the portrayal. Matthew Macfadyen is a brilliant, talented actor and I very much look forward to seeing him on the screen again in the very near future.This movie is visually stunning and well-crafted. I saw it at the theatre only once and, at first viewing, was immediately taken with the choreography of the scenes. The weaving around the ball rooms and the long camera shots are amazing. It was obvious that Joe Wright had paid a great deal of attention to each scene to get it visually right. A great movie can elicit deep emotion visually and set a mood that compliments what is happening on screen between the characters. This movie certainly accomplishes this. Joe Wright appears to have a great career as a film director ahead of him based on this work.I admire the portrayal of the Bennet family in this film. I like that Joe Wright wanted to show them as a ""real family"" and feel it helped make the film. Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet is not nearly as annoying as the BBC version, which I greatly appreciated. She made Mrs. Bennet likable and understandable. Donald Sutherland, especially in the last scene, is wonderful. And, Keira Knightley's performance is lovely. I was very impressed and believe she deserves the all of praise she has received. She captured the essence of Elizabeth Bennet and portrayed her in a real, believable way.The music is wonderful. The locations are breathtaking.The love story between Elizabeth and Darcy is timeless and this movie lacks nothing in telling their story, even with the time constraints and missing characters and dialogue from the book.If you ask me if we needed this version of their love story, I will gladly say yes."	5.0	Lovely!	2006-03-22	15	11	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3BPDY10NGOQSP	"C. G. Riggs ""Gay Riggs"""	"I've seen both versions and like them both for different reasons. The BBC version is far superior than the 2005 version because of the detail of the screenplay. The BBC version gives background as to:(1)why Darcy and Lizzy like and dislike each other (2) how often Darcy and Lizzy were actually around each other (3) why Wickham really runs away with and then marries Lydia. I agree that some of the length of detail in the BBC version made me want to fast forward - (1)was Caroline Bingley really so dense that she continued to make so many unflattering comments about Lizzy even though Darcy made very pointed remarks as to why Lizzy was so favored by him? (2) Mrs Bennet's many hysterics (3) party at Mrs Bennet's sister's house, just to name a few.Had I not previously seen the BBC version I would be left wondering: (1) how Darcy could have fallen in love with Lizzy when only seeing her three of times - at the first dance, when Jane is sick and at the Bingley's ball - then barely saying two words to her each time!  (2) Why in the world did Wickham want to marry Lydia?  The 2005 version left me puzzled.  They had spoken to each other only once in this version - at the ribbon shop - and he runs away with her?  Really? (3) Why was Mr Bennet (Donald Sutherland) even in this version when much of his script was edited out. (4) Why in the world Lady Catherine said to the Bennet family ""You have a very small garden"" when she came in the middle of the night (5) Why Darcy didn't have more to say in the 2005 version (6) How did Darcy manage to walk from Rosings to Longbourne in the wee hours of the morning?Things I liked more about the 2005 version: (1) the house the Bennet's lived in.  Much more suited to their income in appearance and size; (2) the hall where the assembly was held when Darcy and the Bingley's were 1st introduced; (3) Jane (Rosamund Pike) - so beautiful (4) Mrs Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) - less hysterical and more motherly (6) Georgiana Darcy."	4.0	What I did and did not like about this 2005 version. . .	2010-09-09	1	1	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ASHYD3NEZRN0S	Chabaz	"I'm a newcomer as a Jane Austen fan...Started with Sense & sensibility with Emma Thompson a few years back and that was it. I bought this film on a whim and I'm either in great need of romance in my life or there's nothing interesting on TV cause, since I bought this movie, I think I must have watched it every night eversince, it's pathetic or not !!! I can't help myself cause I think it's such a beautiful story and I wish I could snatch a Mr Darcy of my own !!! I think these two center caracters have a certain ""je ne sais quoi"", an undercurrent, a chemistry that keeps me hooked...The proposal(or insulting !!!) in the outdoor monument of somekind, in the pourring rain(which says a lot of Darcy's bewichement), is incredibly electric, they're both very passionate in their debate and I think on the verge of maybe kissing but pride and prejudice keeps them from giving in into their passion about each other....My other favorite scene is the dance at the formal ball, Lizie consented to dance with Darcy against her better jugement but manages to torment and tease poor and sooooo formal Darcy...You could feel unercurrent's going on right then, already...Isn't the scene where Lizie, on a trip with her Ant & Uncle stands on the verge of the precipice beautiful ??? I think this version(Unfortunatly, haven't yet seen the version with Firth) shows such  beautifull scenary, make's me want to definitively to go to England before I die !!!), and the music is heavenly...I fell in love with ALL the caracters, especially the Bennet family which reminds me a bit of my own, nutty and funny and loving !!! And Mr Darcy, under all that frigid exterior has an most ardent core, dont you think...Well, for me this is a beautifull movie and I can hardly think to find such ""amiable"" qualities in the version with Mr Collin Firth(no malice intended), but I LOVE the pairing of Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen and their's is magical, funny, corky, I would say smocky but in that century passion wasn't a thing to show(some, tough, were outside the mold like Lizie was I think and Keira portrays that very convincevly)."	5.0	Romance at it's best...	2013-03-26	0	0	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AGTK3027GYT0Y	Cha	My satisfying first purchase, delivered on-time, great packaging that ensuring the goods arrived undamaged, and a great movie! One of my favorites actually. I loved Focus Features films because of their simplicity and mostly low budgeted movies, which often accompanied by a great storytelling and a good directing. Sometimes I have to get out of those Hollywood big budgeted films, to understand more about films.This one is a very comforting film, beautifully directed by Joe Wright, the sceneries and settings will soothe your mind and refresh your soul. Dario Marianelli is one of my favorite composer, and he's attached a more playful tone in this one rather than a much more 'serious' and 'deep' Atonement score. All in all, I'm satisfied in making this purchase.	5.0	Loved the movie. Loved Focus Features. Loved Amazon.	2012-12-14	0	0	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AEITZKH1EZUFK	"C. Hamilton ""movie buff"""	"This is a good version of an excellent book by Jane Austen, written almost 200 years ago.  There are several other versions on film of ""Pride and Prejudice.""  Although it did not stick to the book in some crucial places, overall it was well done.  It could have been longer and done a better job.One part was very anoying:  Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourg, visited the Bennett family after they had retired.  Even though Lady Catherine was a snobish woman used to having her own way in life, she would not have visited Elizabeth's family that late in the evening.  Good manners would not have let her.  Her feelings of superiority would not have condoned it.  Her mention of a ""little garden"" at the Bennett home should not have been in the film at all as it served no purpose since her visit was at night and it was dark.Overall, not a bad version of a book every fan and viewer of Jane Austen's movies should read.The best version of this book-to-film was A&E;'s.  They had the time to make it almost perfect.  I think Jane Austen herself would have approved of it.However, given the time available, this is still an enjoyable movie if you like Jane Austen."	3.0	Good version of an excellent book.	2007-08-28	5	2	3

Caught it on a plane ride home and I have to say that it took my breath away.  I loved Matthew and Keira together - there chemistry was unbelievable.  Since that plane ride home, I have bought the movie and watch it anytime I can.  I have read the book twice which gives a little more background and watched the 1995 mini series.  I have to say, and I know people are going to be quite angry, I did not feel any chemistry between Firth and Ehle.  I thought the new adaptation of Pride and Prejudice had more emotion and wish that THEY would do the 6 hour mini series because that I would definately buy.  I have told everyone I know about this movie and how fantastic Matthew played the part of Mr. Darcy.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A38JGOXXIAEN7U	chickie	Have never felt even remotely inclined to write a review of a movie, until this one. Took me a couple of years to even consent to view this movie, felt it came out with too much saturation of Keira Knightly everywhere. And knowing the tendency for the big screen to hack up great books and slim down carefully written characters to a manageable 'just over two hours' production. Well, finally decided to give it a chance, and have rarely cringed more than in watching this version of Pride & Prejudice perhaps writing this alone will help someone else.While being a fan of Austen's, I would hardly call myself an Austenite, but after seeing so many liberties taken with her dialog, perhaps I am. Austen was rather wordy, but to chop it up and modernize it was condescending to the reader/viewer. Elizabeth's character came off a snotty and headstrong, instead of self-assured and quick witted. Jane was empty instead of kind to a fault, and Charles Bingley, although interestingly cast, was a bit of a fool instead of endlessly kind.The book and my imagination are very closely seconded to A&E; BBC version of this film with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. This version isn't anywhere near the running.I find it necessary to point out how bad or ridiculous every-bodies hair was, everyone looked as if the just tumbled of bed, or the more senior ladies were over teased so as to look like England's version of New Jersey, not a good look for Dame Judi Dench.The casting was a who's who of England's talent, with the odd exception to Donald Sutherland, who did well enough for a horrible screenplay. Carey Mulligan, a fine actress, was reduced to either crying, laughing too loud, chewing, or the odd exclamation, not her fault, again a horrible screenplay. Judi Dench was so obvious a choice and so over exhibited in this production she could have just sneered as Lady Catherine and saved uttering her few badly chosen lines. Claudie Blakley as Charlotte Lucas was made overly plain, add her character reduced to an an embarrassment as Elizabeth's much loved friend. Kelly Reilly did a great job making Miss Bingley hate-able with her few scenes and fewer lines that were as empty and mean as her poor part was limited to, Miss Bingley was as most of Austen's characters, much more complex, more cunning and conniving, and even admirable in their witty snobbery; Kelly Reilly is such an excellent actress she could have made that happen, but the writing. Matthew MacFadyen appears to have been severely limited too. He must have been instructed to smile far less than even Colin Firth would, and instructed to execute the lines as severely as you can while not moving a single facial muscle, except during the scene in the rain when he seems so intent on kissing Miss Elizabeth that he may even bite her. Oh cringe!Keira Knightly was made so plain, and her lines so devoid of a rich character that Elizabeth Bennet could and should have been. I hardly even liked her as the well beloved Elizabeth. I found myself wondering just which line she would say how, instead of feeling one way or another for her, a bit like watching a tennis match instead of a celebrated love story. He character in those Pirate movies was more deep.In all the movie appears to have been done by casting inexperienced with English talent. It comes off as if someone was given a limitless credit card and told to go shopping for fine things in a well appointed department store, and having never been in one before, gets off the plane in London, hops in a cab, asks the cabbie who his favourite English actors are and sets out to secure them like ridiculous ornaments that they are unaccustomed to. I hope this fine list of talent was paid well for such an overdone empty production.The cinematography appeared amateurish, with wide shots done so long that their length eclipsed the most rushed proposal scene. Poor Matthew MacFadyen had to utter his proposal like the techno-babble of a Dr Who episode; so the audience could view Keira Knightly's skirts billowing in the wind on the peaks at length.Chatsworth is and always will be more beloved as the previous choice for Pemberly (and for it's own merits as one of the finest houses in England, it is NOT the only one however), where it was coyly displayed in a lovely beguiling manor; instead put on display much like poor Judi Dench was. The angles were obvious and over the top, and looked more like a tacky tourist leaflet, instead of subtle showcasing of a grand, well known estate. That display and the final scene of the newly married Darcys overlooking the great estate, made it and them look cheap.The manners and customs of that deliberate era, were replaced by the theme of barging into rooms and constant eavesdropping.The division of rank and money was showcased as usual, and it was cringe-worthy for the Regency Era or any era, where money and intelligence are often mistaken as interchangeable, so kudos for hitting that altogether obvious mark, however Austen subtly rectified this in her book, this film left that issue hanging like bad drapes.The music was lovely, the costumes were good, and the diverse dancing was well represented.I give this 2 stars for the sake of the cast, each of them has such a fine record of their own, with even their TV dramas far superior to this flimsy production. IMDB some of these actors, study the body of their works overseas, watch some of the things that are being put out in UK and you'll too see the emptiness of this work for such a rich cast of fine actors, and even Donald Sutherland.I will never watch this again. And do hope another production tries to come along and eclipse this mess.	2.0	My own Pride & Prejudice about this movie	2013-11-03	5	3	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A83Q5FNIKFX8G	Child of Storms	"The movie ""Pride and Prejudice"" provides a clean, romantic, love story that one enchanted viewer could watch over and over and over again. Near the movies mesmerizing climax the viewer will be in tears of happiness. Miraculously after the movie is over one cannot stop thinking about the unexpected twists and turns the characters endured. Remaining as true to the book as it can in two hours and nine minutes the movie stayed accurate to Jane Austen's descriptions. The movie follows the book.  Elizabeth Bennet, the main character in the movie, is flawlessly played by Keira Knightley, who also played in the Pirates of the Caribbean, and Matthew Macfadyen plays the prideful, misunderstood Mr. Darcy. Since the movies title is ""Pride and Prejudice"" Elizabeth Bennet has prejudice and Mr. Darcy is seen as prideful, because of his reserved, publicly shy nature. ""Pride and Prejudice"" portrays the perfect love story and envelopes and inspires the viewer with a passion for unsoiled romance.Elizabeth Bennet has four sisters all of whom were unmarried. This presented a problem according to their mother whose goal was to marry off all of them to rich respectable gentlemen, when the opportunity presented itself. Luckily two rich men named Charles Bingley and Mr. Darcy were attending a ball which was open to the public. All five Bennet girls attended. By the end of the evening two things about the gentlemen were clear to Elizabeth, one Mr. Bingley undoubtedly fancied her older sister Jane, and two, Mr. Darcy was conceited. Decidedly, hastily, and openly Elizabeth ""swore to loathe him for all eternity."" Although Jane was shy Elizabeth could see that she liked Mr. Bingley. Talking periodically over the next months Jane and Bingley knew each other quite well until Jane received a letter basically stating that Bingley was returning to London. Elizabeth suspected that the despicable Darcy had convinced Bingley to leave because Darcy did not approve of Jane's relatives. After her family's farewells, Jane was sent of to London to stay with relations in hope that Bingley would learn of her presence and visit her.With her sister gone Elizabeth was bored and sad and confused fortunately she was invited to visit a friend. She welcomed the change of scenery and left. This friend lived near a rich pompous Lady who had her nephew, the Mr. Darcy, visiting her. In church all Elizabeth could do was stare at him in disgust then after the sermon she ran outside to be alone in the rain with her tears and thoughts. He had followed her. He proposed to her. She sharply rejected him. He then left her. Elizabeth's mind was spinning, the man she hated had proposed to her! Imagine that! Completely distressed Elizabeth went back to her friend's house to clean up. While staring at her reflection in the mirror, Mr. Darcy entered the house and placed a letter on the windowsill because he could not verbally explain his intentions toward Bingley and her sister. Reading the letter when he had left Elizabeth's view of Darcy had changed. Elizabeth returned home, still bewildered, and found that her aunt and uncle had delivered her sister from London.Although Elizabeth had just returned home, her heart wanted to get away from her family so she gladly accepted an invitation to go with her aunt and uncle to tour the sights of the Peak District. Despite her swirling mind Elizabeth enjoyed the trip, until she learned that they were going to tour Mr. Darcy's home. That set her off. Instantly she tried to sway her aunt and uncle not to see his house, but to no avail. Mr. Darcy's housekeeper talked of her master as a wonderful man, a man Elizabeth prejudged as proud when he was really kind and considerate. She had been wrong about him. After arriving home again, talking with Jane, and resting in the parlor with her mother and sisters, Elizabeth was surprised when Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy knocked on the door. The two gentlemen entered the parlor said a few words then Bingley left suddenly again with Darcy trailing behind because Bingley, who was nervous, did not know how to express his feelings. Reentering the room, moments later, he asked to talk to Jane in private. Elizabeth knew all to well that Bingley was proposing to her sister, and guessed that Darcy had helped him do so. All had ended well for Jane, but does it end well for Elizabeth? You will have to watch the heart wrenching ending to find out.Drawing you in like a hungry bear to food, ""Pride and Prejudice's"" actors and setting made the viewer feel like they were in the story. Keira Knightley did an exceptional job of playing Elizabeth because she showed the character's obvious outward emotions and internally complex emotions as well. She forced the viewer to experience, endure, and relish in happiness, disgust, and pain. Once you feel the emotions Elizabeth underwent it is easier to understand Mr. Darcy's emotions which are intricate and misunderstood. He is a complicated man. Exceptionally well written ""Pride and Prejudice"" is the ultimate love story. If you want a romantic and heart pumping movie, which touches your very soul, watch ""Pride and Prejudice."""	5.0	A Heart Pumping Movie	2007-05-11	3	1	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3OU8Q5JY5HAUA	Chris J	Received the package much quicker than anticipated. Bravo! Have really enjoyed the film. Loved the music and the acting. What a great idea to have the characters in the film the same ages as the characters in the book. While it is very modern in its 'feel' it is also very true to the book (especially when you consider the length of the book that had to be condensed into a 2 hour film). I have read the book many times - it is my favorite- the girls were just as I had imagined them to be, while Kiera Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen were just perfect as Lizzie and Darcy.  I think Joe Wright is a different sort of director - as I watched the movie I was continually aware that some scenes reminded me of art works by Rembrandt, Vermeer etc and the colours of modern artists like Picasso. I was very impressed with the extra features on the DVD and enjoyed the directors commentary. A great feel good movie with wit and charm.	5.0	Pride and Prejudice Blu -ray	2012-10-03	1	1	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AUSKPOLFH4PRV	Chrispy11	This is my favorite book of all time. I own the miniseries in both VCR and DVD format. While I realize it's hard to fairly compare the two, due to running time I found to be fair I'd look at a few different things.  After reading the book so many times one comes to know the dialogue and vernacular. I gave allowances for the running time on the former but the slipping in and out of period vernacular on the latter drove me a bit nuts.  Locations beautiful.  Most of the characters well cast. (Mary is the unnattractive sister and a Talulah Riley is very pretty)  Particularly liked Dame Judy Dench as Lady Catherine and Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett.  Also did not like completely deleting characters and changing the dialogue to suit.  Suddenly the Gardiners have no children?  Where was Maria Lucas?  Unmarried ladies of the time did not travel alone. The the turning-point is the trip to Pemberly. Ladies of the time would not be visiting a house touching things.  Yes I know this movie is adapted from the book, but I think I would have given it another star if it stayed truer to the book and the proper behavior of the period.  I'd watch it again, but like the title of my review states... The Colin Firth mini-series sets the bar and those are some very big shoes to fill, indeed.	3.0	The Colin Firth Mini Series sets the bar	2014-06-26	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2N6XEMKK5X2TH	"Christiane Neumaier-Loek ""Lady Readsalot"""	I've seen the previous version with Colin Firth and have read the book - my personal opinion of this rendition of one of history's finest pieces of literature is that Jane Austen would be turning in her grave if she were forced to sit through this tiresome and pityful movie. The actors for the principal characters ill-chosen and clearly not capable of doing justice to the complexity of their literary personalities: Keira Knightley cannot even begin to fill the shoes of the fiercely defiant and headstrong Elizabeth Bennet, and Matthew Macfadyen's ridiculously poor portrayal of Mr. Darcy pales in comparison to that of Colin Firth. Moreover, the movie completely fails to capture essential high-lights of the story, limps through the development of major relationships between characters, and in general is more tediously boring than any period drama in recent Hollywood history.

Inside is the double disc set, the amazing soundtrack, and a terrific book with lots of commentary on the filming and photos.  The book in itself is a treat as I remember similar Oscar pressbooks going on ebay for upwards of a $100.  (I in fact was able to win a French one -- and am so delighted to have the English counterpart!)  The CD is fantastic -- as the Dario Marianelli music is one of the truly magical treasures of the film.  The 1st disc is exactly like the DVD I all ready have with  the director's commentary; conversations with the cast; Jane Austen, Ahead of Her Time; A Bennett Family Portrait; and HBO First Look.  The 2nd has the new features:  1)The Politics of Dating (with a funny comment by Matthew Macfadyen quipping something like, ""I fancy you; here's my number""  and cutting away to a handwritten Fitwilliam Darcy calling card with a number on it. Too funny.Enjoyable.  2)Galleries of the 19th Century which has stills of various art, furniture and fashions.  Interesting.  3)The Stately Homes of P&P; that you can use the interactive map to look at stills of the homes of the movie as well as watch film with interviews and comments about the locations.  VERY good.  4) P&P; Family Tree was something lacking.  Interesting for those that may be new to the story but for me it was just ""filler.""All in all, I am pleased to have it.  Was excited to get anything new about the story and this film.  Yes, I would have loved to have seen more unseen interviews with the characters, bloopers, cut scenes, etc... If that is what you are hoping for with this new release, that is not in this gift set.  However, if you are a fan of the movie, would like the sountrack, a couple extras on the 2nd DVD, and that most excellent pressbook... then buy this.  I for one am happy to have it in my collection.

I detested her,almost as much as the very shrill- trampy Lydia!The romance between Jane and Mr. Bingley is also more developed in this version,where in the Firth version,it is non-existant,so is it totally unbelievable that Elizabeth even makes a fuss over Mr. Darcy's involvement in parting them,and that Jane and Mr. Bingley would even end up marrying! Also the early relationship between Lizzy and Mr. Darcy is much more developed in this version.Everyone and everything about this version is much more attractive and likeable!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A30JPZ9TZ7I61U	"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi"""	I finished reading Pride and Prejudice and immediately checked out the Colin Firth BBC series as well as this film from my local library.  I watched this film first since it was only slightly shorter than the BBC series from the mid 90s.The film stays pretty true to the nature of the book, with some few exceptions.  Mainly there are many moments from the book which could not possibly make it into a 2 hour film.  Several characters were cut entirely, such as Maria and Sir William Lucas.  The two visits to Catherine de Bourg's estate were condensed into one.  And there are a few added scenes where the film takes some liberty.  All in all though, the changes made were good for the pace and continuity of the film.  The only odd scene was when Lizzy confronted Darcy about Jane and Bingly and Wickham.  He actually gives half of his response there, then the other half is contained in a letter (like the book). But the half response kind of takes something away from that moment as described in the novel.The acting is very good.  I liked the casting for most of the main characters.  Donald Sutherland was an odd choice, but he worked as Mr Bennett.  Kiera Knightly is very good as Lizzy; she embodies the under appreciated attractiveness that is described in the novel, especially compared to her more obviously and classically attractive sister Jane.  Knightly embodies the fire and the tomboy style of Lizzy's character very well.I am most happy with the actor who played Darcy.  He is very good at the brooding, yet firm resolution of Darcy's character.  He has the tall, rugged handsomeness that Austen describes.The production quality is what I liked about this film over the drab and overly dark (just bad contrast, not anything with the lighting) BBC series.  Where the BBC series looks like a DVD made from one of those VHS dubbing to DVD devices, this film shines with dramatic settings, and quality film making.  Granted they had the budget to do so!  But with great cinematography, a quality soundtrack, and terrific casting, this is easily my favorite Pride and Prejudice adaptation (over the Laurence Olivier film and the BBC series).	5.0	Review of the film as compared to the novel~	2012-01-19	2	2	0

It was not be compared to the book, I knew it, but it could have been better done.During the whole film, the rythm is too rapid, it seems that the director wanted to insert as much scenes as possible and it results in a superficial treatment of the characters, in a lack of emotions. There could sometimes be more length, so that we might enter into their minds, thoughts or feelings. We are external to what happens, it isn't really moving. This film is a sort of superimposition of scenes.Moreover the light thrown on the country was too fairy-tale-ish... and the last scene (invented what's more) was the same.	3.0	Had expected more	2006-09-11	8	4	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2ULL3TWEHEU4Y	Cinema Geek	I personally loved this movie. I loved its (perhaps inappropriate) use of Bronte-esque scenery, its earthiness, the boisterous country life of the Bennett family...I loved it all. I realize that the costuming and manners were not quite right for the period. In my opinion the heart of the story survives despite the film's nonconformity to these restrictions. I thought the acting was wonderful, particularly that of Kiera Knightley. Donald Sutherland made me cry. The music was lovely, the cinematography lush and sweeping. There is an unabashed romance to this film that is truly rare in movies today.Is it faithful to the book? No. But then, film is a completely different medium. A good film is not simply the source material (book) with pictures. It involves first the author, then the director, then the actors, art director, cinematographer and so on and so on. All of these people have their own visions to realize. It's a collaborative effort. Jane Austen's original vision is interpreted anew.I loved the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version, but isn't there room for more than one interpretation? Many are acting like Joe Wright stole Pride and Prejudice. If you don't like it, then there's no reason to ever watch it again. Pretend it never happened. I understand. Honest. I won't ever again watch the William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg version of Jane Eyre, but I'm over it. I have a choice- to watch or not to watch.

Granted with a listing of solid actors, I did not anticipate it being bad, but instead a bad interpretation of the book (which I have read a couple of times) especially given the time constraints that feature film provides.While the 1995 TV version is quintessential in its adaptation of the text, the 2005 film version in my humble opinion captures the spirit and the raw emotion that although not on public display must have been in the hearts and minds of the central characters.  I guess this is what many folks consider the ""modern edge"" given to this adaptation.  I personally found it refreshing, vibrant and alive.In terms of casting I must start by saying that I loved Keira Knightley's Lizzie - by far the best interpretation of the role.  And despite those who were blown away by the dashing Colin Firth, Matthew MacFadyen did the role of Darcy service.  His performance wonderfully gives perspective and insight into the perceived fastidiousness of the Darcy persona - I felt like in this version I understood where he is coming from.Beyond the two leads, all the supporting characters did a wonderful job.  I am almost tempted to go to the theater and see it again it was that good.  Highly recommended to all!"	5.0	Wonderful Adaptation	2005-12-01	7	5	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1Y146252AC2JL	C. Ismert	I was enchanted by Pride and Prejudice from the first time I saw it. You watch the whole movie enthralled, waiting for the next moment to come and at the end you think back on it and realize nothing much really happened. Just some balls and a lot of conversation and yet you watch it again with enthusiasm many times over. The characters are perfectly cast. Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy is terribly charismatic and proud and just a little bit sinfully delicious with that deeply resonating voice. Keira Knightly is a delightfuly cheerful and strong-willed Lizzy. Rosamund Pike as Jane Bennet is sweet and ethereally beautiful while Simon Woods as Mr. Bingley is heart warmingly akward and charming. You constantly want to cover your ears as protection from the grating trill of Jena Malone's Lydia Bennet and if Mrs. Bennet played by Brenda Blethyn was your mother you'd want to run and hide though she obviously loves her children which makes up for her overbearing manner in some small way. Mr Bennet (Donald Sutherland) is appropriately preoccupied and Judi Dench is coldly regal as Lady Catherine de Bourg. Each and every cast member was, in my opinion, perfect for the part that they played.	5.0	A love story to last!	2007-04-14	4	3	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3DD96LN8U1NM	citygal	Yes, I know that it doesn't conform to the book as much as we would like, but this movie is still highly entertaining and captures the spirit of the novel.  I think the chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy is well acted by Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen (especially him).  I LOVE the way Macfadyen plays Darcy.  Also, Judy Dench is brilliant (as always) as Lady Catherine. She's SO much better than the actress who played Lady Catherine in the BBC version.All in all, this is an enjoyable movie that I've watched about 5 times so far.	4.0	Loved it!	2009-08-23	1	1	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3NAKQWWOYSXAY	cjwickenden	This movie was a complete disaster. The first thing I found distasteful was Mrs. Bennett. She is portrayed as a hysterical woman with not an ounce of decency or proper manners. She seems to delights in behaving outrageously inappropriate, even breaching proper etiquette. Her daughters, apart from Jane, are portrayed as silly, simpering girls, with no regard for propriety or even common sense. Elizabeth Bennet, portrayed by Keira Knightly, does no credit to the character she is supposed to be portraying. She comes across as snooty, judgmental and often just as silly as Mrs. Bennett and her sisters. She shows no respect for those of superior rank, or even her own parents. Mr. Darcy is portrayed as dull, rather then proud and arrogant. The actress portraying Miss. Carline Bingley would have made a fine Mr. Darcy. In this movie, Mr. Darcy comes across as more nervous and afraid then proud. In fact, in many scenes, he almost looks as if he is about to burst into tears. The only character I actually tolerated was Jane. She, in my opinion, is the only character in this movie that shows any charm or manners. However, like the rest of the cast, she too had no depth.I found the setting of the Bennett home to be absolutely disgusting. The Bennett's are portrayed as extremely poor, so much so that they allow a pig to walk through the house. In the book, the Bennett's were upper middle class and did NOT live on a farm. They certainly would never have had barn animals in their home. Jane Austen would certainly be disgusted at this rediculous portrayal of one of her best works.	1.0	Poor Jane Austen	2012-10-27	10	5	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1EOLRV216BXJ9	Classic Movie watcher	Having watched the 1940 Pride and Prejudice (Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier) and BBC's TV version (Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle), it is simply a must for me to see this remake and compare with its predecessors.In the first 30 minutes, I have to adjust to Keira Knightley's relatively modern face and giggles. She has given such an impressive performance in Bend it Like Beckham and Love Actually that it took time to envisage her in the classic role of Elizabeth. Fortunately, the last hour of the movie saw her adding greater depth to her character, making her and Mr. Darcy a charming couple to watch.While the 1940 version revealed a more comical side of the story (such as performances of Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine de Bourg) and the BBC version was graced by the beautiful landscape and the handesome Colin Firth, I would say this one is a well balanced remake. Maybe Elizabeth (Knightley)and Darcy(Matthew MacFaydyen) on their own do not steal the scenes. Yet together they look such an attractive couple. A 20-year-old Knightley has made Elizabeth come alive on screen, intelligent and beautiful. MacFaydyen has also portrayed a handsome and vulnerable Mr. Darcy. Jane was convincingly sweet and uncalculating whereas Donald Sutherland, as the father, gave her daughter away in tears of joy.The superb cinematography, a sense of tension and urgency when Elizabeth discovered how she had wronged Darcy, a quickening of pace made possible by rearranging and rewriting (Alas, a big risk!)of some scenes have all made the movie a delight to watch. Credits must also be given to a more realistic portrayal of the Bennet family. The Bennet sisters' costumes were conspicously plainer than the Bingley's and Darcy's. The extravagant interior design of the grand mansion (Chatsworth) at Pemberly is simply awesome.As a big fan of the previous versions, to be able to finish the movie and still feel good about it, I would say this movie is a successful remake. Even for fans mesmerized by the other remakes, this movie is worth watching for including new elements which complements nicely to its predecessors.	4.0	It is still a classic!	2006-02-24	13	11	2

For example, Mr. Bennett was just not believable to me and Mr. Colins was poorly cast.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1ZOGS2AYM9XTW	"Clive Barratt ""Clive"""	I have to agree with at least one other reviewer on this site...I could hardly understand a word of what was said in the first 20 minutes or so of this film. Admittedly I saw it at the cinema so the producers may have had chance to do something about it for the DVD release...but short of reshooting the first few scenes with another actress in Knightley's role I can't see how they can. The main problem is Keira Knightley's unwillingness to open her mouth when she speaks. She has an awful habit of sticking out her chin and speaking most of her lines through clenched teeth - it's incomprehensible for the most part and almost had me walking out of the cinema (she was exactly the same in Love Actually). Thankfully for us all her case of near terminal lock-jaw seemed to clear after 20 minutes or so after which we were treated to overall a very good film.Not as good as the BBC version but worth a watch.	3.0	Am I deaf?	2006-03-06	8	2	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Adaptations are always tricky since condensing a large 200-500+ page book can lead to liberties and many events taken out entirely. Another thing that can happen is filmmakers tend to be too nervous of altering anything that what worked in book format doesn't work as well on film. Hence we get Pride and Prejudice, which looks great, has respectable casting, but unfortunately has poor pacing and its 19th century-esque language.The film centers around the Bennet sisters, most specifically Elizabeth(Lizzy) and Jane. They're all trying to get married, hopefully with someone with a big wallet. Jane ends up meeting someone named Mr. Bingley which takes an awful long time to resolve while Lizzy is in a love/hate mode with Mr. Darcy, a friend of Mr Bingley. The entire rest of the film follows the 2 women trying to get their respective men to marry them while the mom gets frantic about marrying them off.One thing that tends to plague adaptations is trying to match the spirit of the novel a bit too closely without making it work in a film format. As such the book resembles the language from the book, incredibly long and dictionary-laden words are throughout the film, making me ask ""isn't it better to just say 'I hate you' rather than that much words""? Same thing with the modern Romeo and Juliet film except this takes place in its proper time period and still seems odd hearing it.Many actors and actresses seem to only have that in title only, as if they don't actually ""act"" they just do their job without doing much else. Usually they're girls with pretty faces where you watch them in a film and they don't really do much else that makes them memorable, they just read their lines. Look at Al Pacino in Godfather or Peter O' Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, perfect acting but making them transcend just lines on the page. The actresses here do their parts well, with a special nod of course to Keira Knightley who still has some awkwardness but is still capable of making a character believable.It's a period piece so you're going to expect 2 things: beautifully shot and accurate costumes and of course we have both. Colorful sharp cinematography with 18th century style clothes make the film feel believable and accurate. The music also suits the film well, largely piano-based with some orchestration peppered throughout but not enough memorable themes to make me want to buy the soundtrack.If you don't really feel like reading the novel, it's always best to check out this film although it's not exactly need to buy DVD material, unless you're a Jane Austen fan."	3.0	3.5; I merely liked it, didn't find it great	2006-02-28	9	4	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2FD4CIFQJW7JI	"C. Mendoza-tolentino ""CMT"""	In my freshman literature seminar, I was put on the spot by my professor and asked how I liked Pride and Prejudice. After a few throat clearings, I admitted that I had not been a fan and in fact found the language so dry so as to make the novel boring. I certainly am not alone in thinking this, and most who do tend to be male. That being said, this movie was incredibly entertaining. I've heard marvelous things about the long BBC version (many people watched it instead of reading the book for my seminar), but it's hard to imagine it being better than this. Knightley reminded me of Winona Ryder in Little Women and played her character splendidly. I highly recommend this for girls and guys alike. You'll love the dry British humor and the wonderful scenery. Maybe even more than the book itself.	4.0	Remarkable Adaptation...	2008-06-11	8	6	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2GCHG6U8HTVIT	C. O. DeRiemer	Pride Ampersand Prejudice (or just plain Pride and Prejudice) is a pleasant movie with nice acting by all concerned. Keira Knightley does a fine job, but for me Jennifer Ehle remains the gold standard for Lizzies. The director and writer crammed a lot into the run time. If you like the more leisurely pace of the BBC Ehle/Firth version, you might find yourself longing for more than you're getting. But with either, or the much earlier BBC version from 1980, the story is such a strong, romantic fable of manners and misunderstandings that it's hard to go wrong. Even the half-hour TV program with Wishbone as Darcy was good. If you've never seen a version of Pride and Prejudice, however, please don't start out with the Olivier-Garson movie.The only criticism I have is that I thought the movie score was overblown and there were a few too many grand scenic shots. This version is entertaining and satisfying but, for me, not especially memorable.	4.0	A Pleasant Way To Spend An Afternoon	2005-12-09	9	5	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1T17LMQABMBN5	CoffeeGurl	"I am an avid fan of the 1995 A&E;/BBC version of Pride and Prejudice starring Colin Firth.  And so, I had my reservations about giving this one a whirl.  Most of Hollywood's literary adaptations are underdeveloped, underwhelming and downright superficial.  Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow springs to mind.  However, this 2005 adaptation directed by Joe Wright and adapted by Deborah Moggach, while not better than the 1995 version, is definitely more enjoyable than the bunch.  (Warning: there will be more comparisons between this version and the 1995 version.  So, if you're tired of reading comparisons between those two, then I suggest you skip reading this review.)  The cinematography is gorgeous -- the scenery and sets are a major eyeful.  The film direction is one of the best I've seen.  Wright has done a splendid job.  The music score is one of the best I've heard.  I especially love ""Dawn,"" the one played in the beginning of the movie.  It is absolutely beautiful. The wardrobe, however, is a disappointment.  The gowns (more Georgian than Regency) are not appropriate for the time.  Elizabeth Bennet would have never attended the Netherfield ball without wearing gloves and Caroline Bingley's sleeveless slip dress with a plunging neckline is downright anachronistic.  Not only does it look too modern, a noble lady would have never worn such a flimsy gown at a formal ball unless she was some sort of daring widow wanting to cause a scandal.  The gowns Mrs. Bennet and Lady Catherine de Bourgh wore were at least two decades or so out of style.  And I won't even comment on Judy Dench's hairstyle except for one expression: yikes!  That hairdo was fashionable in the 1750s -- at least sixty years before Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice.  The quality of the characterization varies from person to person. I do not like Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet.  Knightley does not show the right amount of sharp wit, intelligence and conflicting emotions that makes Miss Bennet one of the most endearing heroines in literature.  The director concentrates more on Knightley's pretty face than on focusing on the character's complexities.  This Elizabeth is too petulant and giggly for my taste.  Jennifer Ehle had a better grasp of the character.  I did not like Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet.  He comes across more as a cynical, laid-back loner than the sarcastic and witty character in the book, qualities that were passed on to Elizabeth.  (By the way, I found it odd that in this film Mr. Bennet and Lizzy do not have the kind of closeness and affection that is required in their roles.)  Also, his imitation of an English accent is simply awful.  I wish Benjamin Whitrow had been cast in this version as well.  I also liked the actor who played Mr. Collins in the '95 version better than Tom Hollander.  Even though Hollander was wonderful in BBC's Wives and Daughters, I feel he was miscast as Mr. Collins.  The actors who played Mrs. Bennet, Jane, Mr. Bingley, Caroline Bingley, Lydia and Kitty do a good job, but somehow aren't as colorful as the ones in the 1995 miniseries.  And last, but definitely not least, is Matthew Macfadyen as the dark, handsome, proud and brooding Mr. Darcy.I don't think I'm being biased when I say that, while Macfadyen does some wonderful scenes in which Darcy shows his longing for Elizabeth, he in no way outshadows Colin Firth's performance.  Firth was able to transmit Mr. Darcy's complexities and conflicting emotions in almost a flawless way.  He also convinced me that Mr. Darcy was indeed rude and proud, or at least seemed that way from Elizabeth's perspective, and Macfadyen's Mr. Darcy comes across more as shy and awkward than anything else, which would have been fine, but then why would he be so against Elizabeth's poor connections and convince Mr. Bingley that Jane isn't the one for him?  The one thing Macfadyen was able to convey better than Firth was his love and desire for Elizabeth.  (Actually, I thought Firth's subtle approach to Darcy's feelings and sexual tension for Lizzy was more dead on.  Macfadyen's approach is more blatant and in-your-face.)  This film's Darcy appearing without a cravat in the last scenes has a nice, sensual touch, but it's nothing like Firth jumping on the lake and then walking back to Pemberley in wet clothes.  Anyway, as for the rest of the film, due to time constraints, many scenes are glossed over, including the whole Lydia and Mr. Wickham debacle.  In fact, Mr. Wickham, such an integral character in the story, appears only in two or three scenes! There are also some characters that are eliminated altogether, like Mr. Bingley's married sister (who was supposed to be Miss Bingley's chaperone.  Miss Bingley would have never stayed at a house alone with two single men, even if one of them was her brother).  And what can I say about this version's Miss Caroline Bingley except that all she does is scowl, purse her lips and look conceited?  Anna Chancellor of the 1995 version may not be as attractive as Kelly Reilly, but she was definitely better developed.  In fact, the characters and storyline were better developed in the 1995 version.  Then again, the miniseries had eight episodes, plenty of time to be true to the novel.  Also, this version is not as centered on humor as it should have been.  This version is more solemn and everything and everyone centers on Elizabeth.  Then there are the anachronisms.  Mr. Bingley would have never entered the private chambers of a female guest, Elizabeth would have never walked around the village with her hair undone, Mr. Darcy would have never entered Elizabeth's bedroom (without wearing a cravat) to hand her a letter, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh would never pay a visit in the middle of the night.  Perhaps these details are negligible to some, but not for me.  Period accuracy is very important to me.  All in all, despite all the flaws I mentioned regarding the cast and condensed plot due to the limited 129-minute format, this adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is still worth watching and owning, which is why I give it four stars.  The last scenes are wonderful and romantic (if a bit corny), perfect for fans of period pieces with modern-day sensitivities.  The DVD is also wonderful -- great audio and video with wonderful special features.  I highly recommend it.  And, if you haven't watched it, please get the A&E;/BBC production starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle if you long for a truer adaptation of Austen's literary classic.  That goes without saying, but I had to anyway. :-)"	4.0	Not perfect or quite as good as P&P '95, but still enjoyable and recommendable...	2006-10-15	12	7	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2XLEGL0834LXP	Colonial Girl	"Admittedly, I did not have high hopes for this moving knowing that it would be hard to do in 2 hours what A&E; did in 5+ hours.  But,  I had thought it would have been better--Emma and Sense and Sensibility were much better shortened Hollywood versions of Austen's books than this was.So what did I find wrong with this adaptation?1.  The Bennets looked sloppy and poor.  I immediately thought back to two lines from the book that made me think that this was not how the Bennet's should have appeared:  Jane tells Lizzy ""We're not very poor."" and Lizzy telling Lady Catherine ""He is a gentleman and I am a gentleman's daughter, so far we are equal.""  I felt that the Bennet's looked just a little better than the orphans in Oliver Twist.2.  Mr. Bennett was portrayed as a grumpy old man.  One thing I  loved about Pride and Predjudice was Austen's humor and Mr. Bennett had in my opinion some of her best lines.  These were totally lacking in this movie and didn't need to be--why change his character completely?  True, he did redeem himself a little in the end and I loved the line about sending in any beau's that may call for Kitty and Mary.""3.  At the movie's beginning, Lizzy seemed to have a chip on her shoulder and hated Darcy from the moment he walked in the door.  I couldn't account for that.  She felt at liberty to make biting comments to him before she ever overheard his critical comment of her.  She really irritated me from the beginning and it was hard to get past that to enjoy the rest of the movie.4.  Mr.  Bingley appeared as a bumbling imbesole instead of a humble and likeable gentleman and I agree with one writer that the actress who played Jane would have made a better Elizabeth.  Jane seemed to have more wits about her than Lizzy.  Kitty and Lydia and sometimes Lizzy seemed to giggle for no reason.  I found them irritating as well. Georgiana Darcy's character was also altered.  The book describes her as being very shy as to appear a snob but that is not so.  This Georgiana was not a bit shy.Overall, I felt that the end of the film was better than the beginning, but I still would never buy or recommend this movie.  I wondered if I would have liked it better having known nothing of the book.  I would have preferred much more of the story cut out to develop the overall love story between Elizabeth and Darcy and give certain characters more presence.I know that my reviews will probably be unpopular, since others who have rated this movie poorly have recieved ratings to reflect that, but to be honest, I find it hard to find many things I liked about this version.I'll stick to the A&E; version."	1.0	Worse than I expected	2006-03-29	213	161	52

The worst feature of the film is the script, with its utterly tin-eared adaptation of Austen's brilliant dialogue. The casting, acting, costumes and attempts to represent daily life in the Regency are also really, really bad. Austen's Eliza Bennett is a rather sharp-tongued young lady, but Keira Knightley plays her as an out and out boor. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett has to be one of the most inappropriate pieces of casting I've ever seen. The filmmakers seem to think that Regency gentlemen lived like Albanian peasants of the same era -- e.g., see the scene in which Donald Sutherland is seen following a large pig into the pigsty which is actually attached to the Bennetts' house. Elizabeth and Darcy play the climactic love scene outside, in their jammies. If you want to watch an adaptation that is true to Austen, buy the DVD of the wonderful 1980 BBC ""P&P"" with Elizabeth Garvie as Eliza Bennett.

That is why I purchased it and I also purchased a copy for my friend for her to enjoy.  I think this is one of her best movies and you see how beautiful she really is. The entire cast is very good in their given roles.	5.0	I love this movie!	2012-10-21	1	1	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3N95F9U9YXTH5	"cosmo ""failure is always an option"""	"In reading other reviews of this movie, I felt I just had to be one to say something nice about it! Just like every other movie, this one had strengths and weakness, here is my take on it:Strengths-This movie looked amazing, it was truely beautiful to look at! The cinematography was beautiful and more artistic than a lot of flims that have come out. The colors were very rich, and the lighting was...perfect. Location shots were wide and encompassing; when Elizabeth first saw Mr. Darcy's home, you can ""feel"" and see how large and impressive it is. Another seen that stands out, was when Elizabeth was being shown around Mr. Darcy's home and is shown into a room full of light, and sculptures. The feeling of coolness in the room, being full of diffused light, and pale white marble figures, was lovely!I also enjoyed a more ""down to earth feel"" to the family, and their looks. They may have had a richer station in the book, but the fact that the family was not swimming in silks, furniture and little lap dogs, hardly detracts from the film. Not to mention the sisters acted, well...like girls! We are not all perfectly behaved all the time, nor are we little angels.Also, the ages for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy in the actors, were closer to the book. And I think their youth and inexperience with love/relationships, was a nice refreshing way to act their parts.Finely, I loved the big ballroom, dance! The music, wall to wall people and activity was very realistic. I felt like I was there in the room, listening to the girls talking, dancing and laughing. In our modern age of elictric lights, CD players and deodorant I think we sometimes forget what a candle light party, with a bunch of sweaty people in it would look like.Weaknesses-Yes, the story is kind of choppy. If you haven't either read the book, or seen the four hour A&E; version you might be lost. Although strangely enough, I went to see this with four other women...all fairly ""girly girls"", and they all felt the story went ""too slow"" and was almost ""too long for a movie"".Another thing I have to agree with, is that the different relationships could have been given more time, or better development. But still, at the end of the movie you don't leave wondering what happend to anyone, or wondering why someone was left out. You know what happens!Conclusion-In the end I really liked this movie. The twist's and a different artistic take on a good story, is always a pleasant thing. Maybe it wasn't historiclly perfect, or exact to the book...but if that is what you really want; Stick to the book."	5.0	Ok...so I liked it!	2006-05-05	22	14	8
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ARFVDIE1E0AZL	"country folks ""shutterbug"""	"The first time I watched this version of Pride and Prejudice I didn't like it at all.  I am not a n Austen purist, but have read all her work and have watched all the film versions.  I watched this version a second and third time, and to give it a real fair chance, I watched it as if it were a ""Readers Digest"" version and did enjoy it.  However, I still had problems with it.These are some of the mistakes that I consider unforgivable, because they could have easily been avoided.  In the scene of the first ball I found it ridiculous that everyone stopped dancing and the music stopped, when the Bingleys and Mr. Darcy entered.  In such a large party how would everyone at once realize they entered?  Why would they all stop dancing?  Like another here wrote, the Bingleys and Darcy are rich not royalty.  Then the Bennets approach them to be introduced.  This would not happen.  They would have waited to be approached and introduced by a mutual acquaintence.Keira Knightly is very cute in this version even if she acts more like a 14 year old than a 20 year old.  Keira Knightly delivers many of her lines too fast, which is the way most silly teens talk today.  Women matured early back then at least in their mind and manner.  You can see this in Jane Austen herself and what and how she wrote even before her teen years.  Mathew Macfadyen seems more depressed most of the time rather than arrogant, or proud.  I can overlook this as there seems to be not much time to develop any nuance in any of these characters in this short version as the producers were more interested in certain scenery, or their own ""art"" and cutting costs.  There were some very beautiful scenes.  I especially liked the gorgeous scene where Elizabeth with her aunt and uncle stopped to eat at the huge tree on their way to Pemberley.  The scene of Elizabeth standing at the edge of the cliff was beautiful, but disturbing.  Who in their right mind would stand that close to the edge of a cliff with, or without, that wind blowing?  The Longborn house was very shabby and unkempt looking.  Not at all like the home of a ""Gentleman"" and his family.  Donald Sutherland is a disappointment as Mr. Bennet.  As another commented here, he looks more the hobo than a gentleman.  He shows none of the wit of the mini series Mr. Bennet, but is a rather bland character.  I did not find this Mr. Collins particularly funny.  The very idea that he would interrupt everyone's breakfast to propose to Elizabeth is ridiculous. I think he would have at least waited til after breakfast.  All the comedy was taken out of Mrs. Bennet.  I did not find much humor in this version.At Rosings Elizabeth meets Darcy again.  She says, ""Mr. Darcy, what are YOU doing here?""  How rude is that?  And, as if she didn't already know via Mr. Collins  that he is the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  Later Darcy barges in on her unannounced as she is writing to Jane.  Apparently he was so bold as to let himself into the house of the Collins'.  Creepy!  Then later on, the first proposal in this version is strange.  Keira Knightly practically spits in the face of Macfayden as she almost screams out his offenses to him.  Then Macfayden comes in so close as to look as though he would kiss her.  How strange is that?!  Again Darcy creeps up behind Elizabeth to deliver his letter of explaination after his proposal has been refused by Elizabeth.  Apparently having again let himself into the house and unannounced.  Again creepy.Another thing that struck me as ridiculous was the statuary, which I thought quite over the top, at Pemberley.  but the biggest mistake was Elizabeth leaving on foot without her aunt and uncle.  For Pete's sake!  Granted she is supposed to be a great walker, but It was 5 miles back to Lambton where they were staying.  Her aunt and uncle must have been besides themselves wondering what happened to her.  Would Elizabeth be so childish as to run off like that?  I think not.Back at Longborn the letter comes from Uncle Gardiner regarding Lydia and Wickham and Elizabeth tears it out of her father's hands.  Shocking!  This is one very rude girl.  Very out of character for Austen's Elizabeth.And finally near the end Lady Catherine de Bourgh comes to the Bennet house at night waking the whole household.  This seems to me the height of impropriety, something completely out of character for this Lady considering her station in life.  She mentions the Bennet's ""very small garden"", but I doubt she would even be able to see it in the dark of night.  They had no outdoor lighting in the country.  In the early morning Elizabeth goes for a walk and meets Darcy walking toward the house. He is on foot yet, and in the fog three miles from where he was staying with Bingley.  This is a very rich man, who would have, if not a carriage, a horse at least.  Neither Elizabeth, nor Darcy could sleep, but Darcy doesn't know Elizabeth will be out walking. What had Darcy intended to do once he got to the Bennet's house?  Was he going to wake everyone at that early hour?  We are to believe, except for Elizabeth, they are all still asleep.Looking on all these faults with humor, I was able to still enjoy this version for what it is.  However, it is best to take the time to view the entire mini series and enjoy the great acting in it.  Colin Firth becomes the ultimate Mr. Darcy on screen and Jennifer Ehle is true to Austen's very lovely Elizabeth.  I much prefer the mini series Bingley, Mr. & Mrs Bennet and Lydia.  I loved all the actors in the mini series and think they played their roles brilliantly."	3.0	Not the best version	2009-01-20	8	3	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AHJ72064U7JFW	Crisitina Chacon	This seemed like the fast forward version of the Pride and Prejudice story compared to the BBC's earlier version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. The lead actors in this version, though unquestionably attractive, lacked the depth of character known to the novel's ardent fans. I know Mr. Darcy is a snob, but Matthew Macfadyen never cracks a smile. It just felt like the story flew by with the actors running through their lines like they had to get somewhere fast; a directorial flaw I'm sure. On the other hand, Mr. Bennett's poorly articulated lines were impossible to understand without subtitles.I don't regret buying it at the $9.99 price just to have enjoyed the last scene, which, to give credit where it's due, and though a bit sugary, was more romantic than the BBC version. We wait ardently for Mr. Darcy to finally kiss his Elizabeth, and the BBC version left me longing for a more passionate visual effect. This one had a little more magic.	3.0	Fast Forward	2012-03-02	2	0	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A31ELTOVZM5JHR	C. Rothlind	"I suppose it could be said it was my misfortune to be introduced to Pride and Prejudice by the 1983 BBC adaption by Fay Weldon directed by Cyril Coke and starring Elizabeth Garvey and David Rintoul. Not the 1940 Leonard version with Oliver and Greer Garson, nor the later BBC adaptation with Colin Firth, and not, alas, this 2005 version measure up in tone or historical accuracy. The beauty and faithfulness of Weldon's script, the spot-on casting and attention to historical detail more than make up for the lesser production values.Keira Kneightly fails completely to project the moral character of Jane, conveying little more than a sort of morose petulance with her vacant, glazed-over expressions, colossus of a jaw and toothy mouth. Spoiled and resentful instead of spirited and principled, her emotionally constipated delivery of lines seems forced and pugnacious rather than courageous. Nothing about her invites us in--she is too stiff and self-conscious, too virginal. Sentimental music by the yard and grand landscapes are no substitute for emotional resonance with the protagonist. The thread-bear script is in part to blame for the failure to convincingly embody the moral- and class-conflicts that drive the novel. Jane is never allowed to manifest as the outspoken, head-strong, shrewd yet empathic young woman that she is. Perhaps her character was dumbed-down out of a fear that a modern-day audience, with its egalitarian prejudices (the taboo against distinguishing oneself intellectually) and despite its enlightened feminism, might be put-off by such a characterization. Elizabeth Garvey, on the other hand, managed to be alluringly feminine (warm) and intriguingly articulate--the ideal balance of head and heart.The film fails to convey the mores or the class- and sex distinctions of the period with any conviction. The minds behind this adaptation seem younger (more beholden to youth-culture) and older (wan and worn-out) at once. Judi Dench does raise the octane level with her caricature of Lady Catherine De Bourg's demonic fury. But Brenda Blithyn as Mrs. Bennett is not irritating or shrewish enough by half, and Donald Sutherland, emasculated and mumbling his way through in one continuous aside, is completely wasted. Only in the 1983 BBC adaptation has the character of the father been allowed to assert his patriarchal prerogative and provide an effective check to the over-bearing and histrionic mother, who was meant to be insufferable. Matthew MacFaydean makes a sleepy, crestfallen and disengaged Darcy, where Rintoul is authentically haughty with hidden depths. A lot was sacrificed in the characterizations of both Darcy and Jane to make them `likable' to modern day hipsters. The result is a confection of a film, hollow and without integrity, content to be a historical spectacle.By the time Darcy and Jane come together in Cyril Coke's 1983 adaptation--without as much as a kiss, just a couple strolling through a park--it's quite overwhelming. I'm hard-pressed to think of another reconciliation in all of film that could compete for impact. And it's all done with spoken dialogue--the sublimely beautiful language of Jane Austen faithfully rendered by Fay Weldon--and silence. There is an element of cosmic tragedy as the camera sweeps up over the trees, even as they emerge at long last from all their pretenses and misunderstandings (""pride and prejudice!"") to bear their souls, happily surrendering to one another. It is the archtypal situation of love supervening upon hatred (envy).Kneightly and MacFaydean, by contrast, seem more like teen-agers who suddenly stop playing hard to get and find they have the house to themselves. Had they consummated their passion before our very eyes to sweeping violins we could not have cared any less. So if you want to be transported to another time and mind-set, to a pre-modern world at once more rigid and more genteel, try the Coke adaptation. It is as close as you will get to reading the novel without actually reading it."	2.0	Not the Spirit or the Letter	2008-03-27	15	7	8

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3ICO3NRPPORKQ	C. Sander	"As many others have said, I'm a devoted van of the 1995 Colin Firth miniseries and my copy of the book is dog-eared from much reading. However, after viewing the movie several more times over the course of the weekend, I've come to like it almost as much as the 1995 miniseries, I think.  The mini-series is good if you are looking for a skillful, faithful, and more complete adaptation of the Darcy-Elizabeth romance.  This version of the story however provides an intriguing artistic take on it - which is good, because a more ""literal"" take could never have succeeded in the two-hour-movie format, given the 1995 precedent.  The use of music goes beyond normal soundtracking to become almost operatic in its expressiveness of the emotion.  The essentials of the emotions between Darcy and Elizabeth really come to the fore - which is fine because a two hour movie can't take the time to slowly reveal them w/ the subtlety that the book and the miniseries did.  The chemistry between the two leads is gripping, and the changes to the plot - which mostly amount to changes in the setting (Darcy proposes the first time outside in a rainstorm rather than in the parlor) rather than substance. And though the dialogue was a bit jarring at first since it departs markedly from the book, on further viewings I realize that the writers generally did an excellent job of conveying the essential meanings in fewer and more modern words.However, for those well-versed with the story bewarned - on first viewing several things about this movie were jarring: the pace (very fast - and not because they cut things out which was inevitable. . . the dialogue is delivered in rapid-fire-succession at points), Elizabeth's demeanor (aggressive independent instead of playful gentile independent), the dialogue (they didn't just modernize the language, they did subtly adapt the *meaning* of some things said in key exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy to make the characters more palpable to modern viewers, I think), and the total evisceration of important side plots (Wickham and Elizabeth's relationship, the presence of the militia in Meryton).Still, despite these things, I think they made excellent use of the two-hour movie format.  There wouldn't have been any point in trying to make an extremely faithful but truncated version of the story, because it couldn't have held a candle to the miniseries.  Instead they chose to do something a little different with the story, and I think it works."	4.0	Artistic, not literal - good for the format	2006-04-20	20	15	5

The first time I saw it I left the theater behind two women my age (boomers) with three teenage girls, the youngest of whom said ""Mom, I want a Mr. Darcy"", to which the mother replied ""We all do!""

I've seen Bride & Prejudice and Pride & Prejudice, A Latter-Day Comedy.  Each one has something to offer, and this new version is no exception.I really liked how they cast actors who were very close in age to those in the book.  Keira Knightley's youthful exuberance was endearing, and I enjoyed watching her mature before our eyes. Matthew MacFadyen's performance as Darcy was more nuanced than any I have seen before. This version doesn't need made-up fencing, bathtub and wet t-shirt scenes to show us his intensity and his sensuality.  He and Knightley both have very expressive eyes and an understanding that less is more.  They have a chemistry that is almost palpable.It's not everyone's cup of tea (especially for the Firth fangirls), but it is mine, and I love it to death.  I saw it 9 times in the theater, and have seen it twice at home (so far) via the UK edition of the DVD.  I look forward to seeing the extras on the US disc.	5.0	Delightful!	2006-02-13	21	13	8

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	I'm not one for movies of this nature.  I was not a fan of Ang Lee's 'Sense and Sensibility' yet after watching this wonderful and delightful film I just might watch the latter again, you know, for a second opinion.  Based off of Jane Austins novel of the same name, Pride & Prejudice revolves around Elizabeth Bennet (Knightley) and her sisters as their mother (Brenda Blethyn) tries to marry them off.  The eldest daughter Jane (Rosamund Pike) is quickly taken fancy by a wealthy young man, yet it's his best friend Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) who catches the eye of young Liz, but not in a good way.  While she can't deny her attraction for him, his arogance blinds her love and drives her away from him, but as events take place that uncover her eyes to the real man he is she puts her pride and pejudice aside to be with the man she loves.  The acting here is top notch, with Keira taking the top position here.  She was brilliant, lovable, likable, adorable and believable.  Donald Sutherland, who play's Liz's father, did amazing with his role and I can see why so many wanted him to recieve an oscar nomination.  I was also very impressed with the amount of power Dame Judi Dench brought to a role that recieved such little screen time.  The scene where she confronts Liz is one of the best in the film.  She truly is a star.  This film, from start to finish, was oscar worthy and theres no doubt in my mind that we'll see Keira at the awards again soon, hopfully this time she will be taking home her own little (yet heavy) man.	5.0	"""And how are you feeling today, Mrs. Darcy?"""	2006-03-07	11	6	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A15EQIZLB3S231	"Dana Bailey Wheeler ""prunellabooks"""	The Regency era was a time of elegance, formality and societal restrictions...the cast in this movie had the dress and manners of the age of &#34;Tom Jones&#34;, romping out the dance floor like an 18th century bacchanal.  Elizabeth Bennett , like Jane Austen, would have never have worn a drab, olive green dress that looked like a handmade flour sack to a ball, (as was worn by Lizzy Bennett at the first local ball scene) and none of the Bennett's wore hats in this movie, afraid they would lack sex appeal, one supposes as the whole feel of this movie is a steamy bodice ripper romance.  A lady would never had gone out in public without a hat and gloves then, ever.  Everyone's hair was totally out of character of an early nineteenth century person, with loose frowsy manes from our day ( on a beach) whereas ladies then usually had short curly cuts close to the head, or formal updos with pearls etc. while  the men sported short cuts like the Brutus, as the nation was at war and a military bearing was the fashion.  The grace of Darcy was perfected by Lawrence Olivier, and no one has come close to his brilliant interpretation...why this obsession to create a hulking sex object , smoldering and glowering like a spoiled teenager?  And Donald Sutherland's teeth were so big, white and gleaming that he might as well have been wearing Adidas sneakers to proclaim he was a 21st century male!  No one had  caps and neon white teeth in the 19th century...especially if they were in their 60's. The problem with this whole production was its emphasis on the**** STARS***and pandering to their vanity and not to the story or of faithfulness to the period.  I thought the whole film a waste of time!  A meretricious, glossy, false and completely clueless Hollywood adaptation that need never have been made.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A8C30CR0VGO1L	"Daniel Myers ""sombrereptiles"""	"Have you ever seen the ""15 minute Hamlet""?  At the end, they find that they have some time left, so they do it again, but even faster.  That is this version of Pride and Prejudice.I do not understand how so many people have rated this film 5 stars.  I tried to like it, I really did, but the entire story is rushed.  The actors seemed so involved in trying to enunciate the lines at speed (to varying degrees of success) that most other aspects of performance seem to have been left out.The only reasons this movie got even two stars:Camera work was very nice, as was the lighting and background musicScenery and costuming, excellent, espeically the marriage proposal scenes - almost (but not quite) worth watching the movie just for those scant minutesThe dances were fantastic - blocking, cinematograpgy, sound, even the directing was a little better thereStill annoyed about:Liz is supposed to be pretty, but not as pretty as her elder sister:  Keira Knightley has a nice face, but is the twig thin that is popular in Hollywood and is modern high fashion - in period she would have been completely unremarkable beyond skinny.  Even so, she is a good sight better looking than Jane.Dame Judy Dench as Lady Cathrine DeBurgh was the equivalent of lighting your charcoal grill with a gallon of lighter fluid and three sticks of dynamite.  Her screen presence and intensity put the already pale performances in an even worse light.The hurried nature of this Cliff Notes version of the book ends up with mixed pacing.  The actors were all waiting hungrily to pounce on and devour their lines, leaving the audience both winded and bored.In the end, the best I can say about this show is that it is much closer to the book than the black and white version, where they tried to combine Lizzie with Jo from Little Women, not to mention turning Lady Cathrine DeBurgh into a matchmaker.  Oy.Just go watch the BBC-Colin Firth version.  This may be shorter, but it's not worth the chunk of your life which could be spent watching the first disc of a better version."	2.0	Turbo Powered Austin	2006-05-18	22	9	13

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AL636B3PE2O77	Dark Phnix	I must admit, when I first saw it, I was critcizing everything. I didn't like the actor they chose for Mr. Darcy, I didn't like Keira as Elizabeth. There were also some aspects of the play that irked me- technical things; things the character wouldn't do. Of course, I realize that it has been a few years since I thorougly read Pride and Prejudice but as the movie continued on I began to enjoy it.I found the actor who played Mr. Darcy very attractive. I loved the costumes, the music, I thought the acting was good and lo and behold, I loved the movie. I cannot stop watching it. I enjoy trying to catch the little mannerisms of the characters and the looks between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The more I watch it the more I realized that I was wrong about Keira- she was really good in this.I can understand why many people may not like it. There are some movie adaptations based on some of my favorite books that I hated. Am I a purist? No! but sometimes you just want the movie to catch the magic of the book and I'm starting to realize that it can't happen. That's why you can always go back and read the book. It's more fulfilling when you can envision the characters yourself.This movie is not for everyone, Austen fans or not. I never seen the Colin Firth version but now I want to. I forgot how much I loved Jane Austen and I thank this movie for reminding me. I'm rereading the story now. All I have to say is, just rent it first or watch it on HBO since they're showing it now. It doesn't hurt to try it and then make the decision. I enjoyed it, i thought it was good. I have not seen all of the versions so I can't answer which one is better.Of course there were some differences between this and the book. But I think it's good enough to recommend to others. I had my misgivings at first but I took the chance and watched it and now I love it. Take a chance, it's not bad.	5.0	I'm Glad I Watched It	2006-12-18	6	4	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A35ABIF7B4M6KV	"Darlene T. ""former bookseller"""	"Keira Knightley's fine performance cannot save this poor representation of the great book by Jane Austin. The visual presentation of the Bennet home was shocking. Rather than a gentleman of moderate means we see a household where the family walks through the chickens' habitat to enter the back door, the hog is led by the open kitchen door - it's a mess. Mrs. Bennet is represented as a sometimes drunken slob instead of the proper wife, light in intelligence, seeking to fulfill her primary duty - getting 5 daughters, with little dowry, married. There is no attempt to portray the close relationship of sisters, Elizabeth and Jane.  In fact, the relationship is cast as that between sisters Eleanor and Mary Ann in ""Sense and Sensibility"". It was a terrible disappointment in nearly every respect. Buy the version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle - it's a treasure whose length gives hours of pleasure."	1.0	A Great Performance - a Poor Film	2007-01-03	19	6	13
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ADVX0P3EIKWBK	Darth Wader	"First things first, I have never seen the Colin Firth version of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" which has gotten such rave reviews, and I have never read the book by Jane Austen.  With that said, I think I came into the movie unbiased and had nothing to compare it to.  I loved this movie and felt that it had several key aspects to make it a great movie.  First, Keira Knightley does an amazing job as Elizabeth and she has a face that is so captivating that you cannot keep your eyes off of her.  In every movie she is in, she steals the scene.  Matthew Macfayden does an excellent job as Mr. Darcy as he transforms himself in the movie from one type of character to another.  When you're supposed to dislike him, you do.  When you're supposed to like him, you do.  Simon Woods as Mr. Bingley also does an excellent job and is very likable throughout the movie.  ""Pride and Prejudice"" has great pacing, beautiful cinematography, and conflict which kept you involved in everyone's lives.  Plus, it has Donald Sutherland as the father who plays each line to perfection.  One suggestion I would make to somebody watching is to what I did.  Put the Subtitles on the DVD so you won't miss a word that is said.  It is most helpful!  So I would probably give this movie about 4 1/4 stars as it had all the elements of a great movie."	4.0	Excellent movie	2006-06-26	9	5	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Jane Austen's classic novel tells the story of the five Bennett girls and their misadventures on the way to marriage, centering, of course, on the second daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), and her great romance with Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen).  Joe Wright's fine direction and Deborah Moggach's capable adaptation are certainly indispensible elements of this excellent film, but Knightley's performance is really at the heart of it.  She brings an irresistable natural exuberance to her portrayal of a girl changing into a young woman who longs for romance.This film deserves a better rating than 3 1/2 stars, but it seems that many people compare it unfavorably to the miniseries that aired on A&E.;  I haven't seen that version yet, but I urge anyone to give this film a chance and judge it by its own merits.

I would be ok with changes and creative edits if it were not for the fact that the characters have been morphed into either blubbering idiots (Mr. Bingley) or melodramatic ninnies who cry in almost every scene and physically run away from all conflict (Elizabeth Bennett).  This movie has exchanged wit for stupidity, charm with repulsive cheesiness, and even rid the thing of every piece of sarcastic humor that existed. Mr. Bennett cries in this movie for Christ sake!  It really is the antithesis of what Pride and Prejudice was all about.

HOWEVER they do a very good job at trying to keep as much as they could and keep the story strong. I know some people are Jane Austin purists and don't like this movie because it's not exactly like the book. My advice to them is to STOP WATCHING MOVIES! They're probably more resentful that a movie version was made to begin with because naturally not everything makes it into the movie. I have read the book and I still love this movie.I wasn't sure about seeing it, but I am a fan of Keira Knightley and figured I'd give it a watch as friends recommended it. Well I fell in love with the movie and bought it off of Amazon and I've watched it at least 20 times (that's probably a conservative figure).

What possessed the makers of this film to cast Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet, or Donald Sutherland as her father? Knightly's Lizzy is a giggling and immature airhead, with no depth of character whatsoever. The language and behaviour of the time is ignored, the dialogue is very clumsy, and the costumes and general appearance of the characters are shabby. Macfadyen's Darcy looked as bored as I was. Did the scriptwriters read the book before setting about writing the script? Was any historical research done? I doubt both. There isn't a scene in the entire film that I can say a good thing about.

But Tom Hollander (As Mr. Collins), Simon Woods (Bingely) and  Rosamund Pike (Jane Benntt) were very, very good.And Judi Dench (as Lady Catherine de Bourg - perhaps better known as 'M' from James Bond fame) is quite simply one of the greatest actresses of our time.I also enjoyed the costumes and the overall look of the movie.The story did stray from the book some, especially in the Bennetts fiancial situtation. But most of the changes otherwise were needed to movie the story along. Having read the book many, many moons ago I recogizied most of the changes but after re-reading the book I noticed more changes.

Baxter	As an admirer of Jane Austen novels, I ordered this video because it was the only version of Pride and Prejudice that I could find with a Spanish soundtrack--and it did serve that purpose. The rendition of Jane Austen's novel, however, was very disappointing. I have viewed many video versions of Pride and Prejudice and have found one to excel far above the rest in accurately depicting the book. That is the BBC production starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul, which adheres very closely to Austen's original text. In the BBC version, the settings are authentic and realistic for the era, and the casting is excellent. For anyone who has read and enjoyed the novel Pride and Prejudice, I highly recommend the BBC video.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3G7SU6VZG56Z5	D. Combs	The mini series was so much better. This try at Pride and Prejudice was a mistake from start to finish. The characters in this version of Jane Austen's book, except for Elizabeth and Darcy and Mrs. Bennet, are card board cutouts. If a person is not familiar with the mini series or the book every other character in this movie would make very little sense. The special connection between Elizabeth and her father is missing. Donald Sutherland is a fine actor. He made a dreadful Mr. Bennet. Kiera Knightly had too many nothing closeups that didn't really develop the character of Elizabeth. Matthew MacFadyen seemed too soft to be Darcy.The dance scenes at the hall in Meryton are much too long and took away time that the movie needed for character development. Too many extras took away the feeling that this was a country dance for the gentry, and not some crowded London ball. It made me feel that because so much money was spent on these scenes the producers wanted to get their money's worth in screen time.Elizabeth's clothing was dark and dreadful. She looked like she was wearing what a servant would wear for most of her scenes. The Bennent home was shown as shabby. The Bennents had a good income they just spent it all as it came in so didn't save for the future of the Bennent daughters or Mrs Bennent. Because the estate was entailed on a male relative they would be turned out when Mr. Bennett died. That was Mrs. Bennet's biggest worry. Even then each daughter would get a small income. So why show them living like they were in such poverty?Jane Austen was making a point about society, and how circumstances could change a woman's place in it. This version of Pride and Prejudice misses the mark here too. Jane Austen expanded on this theme with Sense and Sensibility. The 1995 movie version of Sense and Sensibility is also worth seeing.This Pride and Prejudice was slow and tiresome, and I wondered how much longer? I had read good reviews and thought there must be something better ahead. The silly ending was all there was.Buy the A&E; mini series instead, and don't forget to also buy the wonderful 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. Both the 1996 TV and movie versions of Emma are also worth buying.	1.0	Save Your Money	2006-05-05	51	28	23

"So you end up at a friend's place, and they pop this in, and five minutes later you're wishing your wife would call with a sick dog or extended family crisis so you could escape. You don't believe me? Let me explain:This movie takes a classic of literature, and dumbs it down so that all traces of subtlety are lost, and even further, all depth of character is lost. These people are cardboard silhouettes walking around and reacting in really obvious ways to really obvious problems; they have no souls, or character, of their own. They're actors creating generic characters that are dressed up like Jane Austen ones.For example, the dialogue. Gone are the complex elegant sentences; they might as well have translated it into Valley Girl, Surfer or Jive for as much as these speaking parts resemble the original. With that loss of elegance goes much of what defines each character, and it is replaced by a movie that makes the worst sin of a literary re-creation, if you ask me: a talky movie in which very little is actually said because all spoken ideas have been boiled for eight hours before serving.Even worse, the action. We the audience are expected to be dumb as rocks and distracted, so every action has to be jerkily symbolic in the same way traffic signs, middle fingers, and giant explosions are symbolic -- a one-dimensional, brain-dead, spoon-fed kind of way. Characters no longer maintain a tense balance of mutual respect and competition; they fight like bickering drunks. Scenes do not crackle with many different kinds of emotion, but pound us senseless with a single one.In short, this film is awful -- and doubly so given the better alternatives just a click away. Hollywood took a literary classic, threw it in a blender, and took parts out and pasted them into a typical Hollywood plot with typical Hollywood neurotic brain-stem characters. Now they want us to buy it presumably to turn us off from literature forever, so we can watch the latest starlet vehicle and think, ""Well, at least it was better than that tiresome Pride and Prejudice.""

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	"Before it was released, Joe Wright's adaptation of Jane Austen's novel seemed destined for failure.  After all, a ""definitive"" BBC version starring Colin Firth already existed, with a stellar cast and a faithfulness to Austen that purists adored.  This newest entry, however, is every bit as compelling as its BBC relative.  Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet is brilliant; her Elizabeth is keenly intelligent, witty, spunky, and, above all, utterly charming.  While the BBC version may be known as the ""Colin Firth version"" for that actor's memorable performance as Darcy, this one will be known as the ""Keira Knightley version,"" as the emphasis here is firmly on Elizabeth, exactly what Austen would have intended.  Of course, Knightley is surrounded by excellent actors such as Mathew Macfayden (Darcy), Judi Dench (Lady Catherine), and Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennet), but her outstanding performance is responsible for this film's success.For those unfamiliar with the plot:  the Bennet family lives in a precarious situation.  With no male heirs and a household of five unmarried daughters, their future is uncertain, as the house will be inherited by the family toad, Mr. Collins, upon Mr. Bennet's death.  As in most Austen novels, the mother sets about frantically trying to match up her girls with men of social standing and wealth to ensure that they will all be cared for.  When repressed aristocrat Darcy and his foppish but eligible friend Bingley arrive in the country, Mrs. Bennet starts scheming.  In keeping with the theme, the truth of matters are often obscured by the ""pride and prejudice"" of the characters, lending complexity to the plot.Probably the most amazing accomplishment in this film is the transformation of Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship.  Macfayden is cold, judgmental, repressed, and glowering--and yet by the end of the film, without significant change in his countenance, his Darcy seems perfect for Knightley's radiant Elizabeth.  Likewise, Elizabeth's gradual appreciation of Darcy is completely believable, although unfortunately the film suggests that his wealth first turns her head.  Much of what transpires between these characters is expertly shown through the actors' eyes and small gestures, which then makes it equally believable that no one else suspects their growing affection for each other.This adaptation, while not entirely faithful to the novel, captures the spirit of Austen's masterpiece.  The cinematography is as accomplished as the performances, giving the film a vibrancy that puts aside any question of pretension.  The only sour note comes in the last moments of the film when Wright and screenwriter Moggach opt for sappiness over the unsentimental beauty of the rest.  This misstep can be forgiven, given the utter brilliance of everything that comes before it.  Highly recommended, even for those who would not ordinarily sit through a literary adaptation."	5.0	All Keira Knightley!	2006-06-06	13	8	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2G1GCHGVUG98K	dee	"This version has its merits.  The scenery is terrific, and the one scene in the morning mist with the sun rising is incomparably beautiful.  Mary and Anne de Bourgh are treated more sympathetically than in the BBC miniseries' version, and Jane and Wickham are very good-looking (as they're written in the novel).  Judi Dench as Lady Catherine is good.The two-hour time frame makes it difficult to develop the story very much, so basically everything that isn't Lizzy-Darcy is truncated (Lizzy-Jane, Lizzy-Mr. Bennet relationship, even Lydia and Wickham is shortened).  Some of the period stuff (another reviewer mentioned the bedroom visits, and the costuming) is a little off.  But these aren't major problems, at least for me.My main issue with it is that it feels like a twenty-first century version of the story.  It is more angsty, and it takes a very modern young person view of Lizzy and Darcy--that is, it has them behave emotionally more like us moderns would at their ages rather than the Lizzy and Darcy of the novel and of two centuries ago.  It's got a twinge of the WB teenage drama in it.The cleverness and the wit of Austen's work are minimal here, and it feels more somber.  Mr. Bennet's ""sarcastic humor"" is gone; his lines are delivered seriously.  Mr. Collins' servility and Mrs. Bennet's nerves and silliness are much toned down from their BBC versions, making the characters more personable, but it feels just a little less.  (Less amusing, for sure.)I had trouble caring for this movie's Lizzy and Darcy.  Austen's Elizabeth had an easy playfulness and a quickness about her.  This Elizabeth has lost most of her witty humor (albeit fitting of the more serious tone of the movie) and thus comes across a little shrill, without the lively charm to cover for her more ""insolent"" moments.She is emotional and flighty, swinging from smiling and giggly to crying hard, to yelling (raising her voice) at Darcy during the first proposal--which seems a little weird for the restrained manners of that time period.  This Elizabeth feels more like a modern, fiery teenager than the proper, confident but lively novel heroine.Darcy, here, instead of being proud, just comes across as sad.  He has sad puppy dog eyes the entire movie.  To me, it makes Lizzy's rejection seem a lot harsher.  Even the end scene (for American audiences?) didn't make me like them any more--it just felt hokey instead.The novel has Lizzy and Darcy as equals in intellect and in faults--Lizzy to drop her prejudice and Darcy to learn to change his pride.  In this movie version, Lizzy just comes around to where Darcy is; he doesn't change.As a movie taken by itself, not bad, and a fast way to acquaint onself with the basic storyline.  To see a much truer version of the novel, though, watch the 1995/1996 BBC/A&E; miniseries with Ehle and Firth."	3.0	Not bad	2006-08-05	12	9	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ANGCVJN6WLN2O	"Dennis Bey ""DB"""	"I haven't read Jane Austen's book or seen the BBC series.  Sorry...kill me!!I enjoy movies and don't feel the need all the time to read the novel beforehand.I did read ""No country for Old men"" before seen the movie. Definitely there's a big gap between some movies and their book.I also understand that movies have only 2 hours to comprise a book.  Many fans of the book may not share the inevitable editing choices, due to time and business constraints.  That is another constant inevitable.  But also, those editing choices made it possible for an excellent book to reach a mainstream audience, that otherwise may never have had the possibility to be exposed to some part of it and/or relate to it so closely.Since this a forum to review THE MOVIE, I'll do that.  I hope some readersappreciate my review it's not biased by the novel, which I don't doubt is great.First the cinematography and photography are outstanding.  The music is beautiful, it enhances greatly every piece.  The costumes are gorgeous, may or may not be appropriate for the period on some regard.The language is striking, rolls over the tongues of the characters easily and pleasantly.Sophisticated language used to provide a richer communication than we have with our contemporary butchery of it.Reminder of a time where people read and language was enjoyed and honed to increase it's effectiveness, on societies where statements were carefully worded, because what said meant what it meant, and people were not able to hide behind sarcasm and ignorance, when honor was beheld high.  And the consequences of disrespect and/or misunderstandings were significant.A time without TV:) -if you want to save your soul smash yours with a bat-Mr. Darcy is a proud, perfectionist man.  A pose he adopts to protect himself from his insecurities.  By this device, avoiding the risk of trying to attract and be rejected.  He places unrealistic qualities on his ideal woman to avoid having again to be attracted to the real one and be rejected.The essence of shyness, which everyone can relate to.  The flawed leading man, cornerstone of every good script.""I don't have the talent of conversing easily with people I have not met before"", Darcy confesses to Elizabeth, revealing his flaw, disarming himself and standing naked shy before the woman he loves, as his greatest gift.  Teased by Elizabeth, he finds himself as rules of seduction will point,even more captivated by her.And rising love as a catalyst of virtuosity in men, the only force so powerful as to bring a man out of this shell of pride, and risk utter embarrassment: his deepest fear.The fear of, as The great Lebanese poet/philosopher Kahlil Gibram says on  ""The Prophet"" in his essay about Love:""...To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully...""Darcy Places too much importance and pride on his intellect.  Hence, protecting himself of the ""foolishness"" of emotions, and all spontaneous crazyness that comes with strong states of emotion as love, with all the revelations of your true self it entails.  All that could lead to unexpected acts,  and to uncharted territory.  That is dreaded, thus avoided by the one inclined to control out of fear of failure or rejection.The first time he touches Elizabeth's hand to help her into the carriage and feels that unequivocal heat of great chemistry, punishes himself for his warmth and the possibility of having disclosed his emotions.  You can witness that on the shot of the tensing of his hand afterward.  Those subtleties punctuate the movie, and the detail makes the story more intriguing.Elizabeth is as many other heroines, is ahead of her time.  With a strong character and habits considered exclusively masculine is more of a modern woman.  Witty and with an acid sardonic sense of humor punishes all that she spots easily as phony.Her wit and sarcasm her are her own shell, though, as hard as Darcy's.  And also the flaw that bonds them and along with their skill with words.  Language as a an armor becomes also a game for the two, to prove who's able to penetrate the other defenses, mascaraded attraction, finallyWounding them both, with the delicious bittersweet tenderness of sexual repression liberated.And yes, ever so trite: love.She's more open to love, and so able to taunt Darcy into following her into their final ""jump"" into the unknown depths and heights of love and their ultimate purification.  Below the pouring rain, yes, a trite a cliche as it can be cliche, but still powerful as powerful poetry can be.""A woman difficult to alarm"" as Mr Darcy qualifies her, Elizabeth is, as all heroines, a malcontent, a free soul not bounded by social conventions.  Moreover, a rebel and a outspoken critic of conventions.Again, traits contemporarily all can relate strongly, and make her so attractive as a modern character.It was a time and place where women are limited by social structuring to depend in a great deal on men's favors of their beauty primarily.  Relegating education to a lesser state,On the scale of traits needed for survival and social acceptance.For men also emblematic of power, pride, honor, masculinity, etc.Marriage then was a huge deal in  their lives.  These period conditions conjure more intense romantic games.  With more at stake, with more tension, pride and prejudice keep lovers apart, through the heart wrenching twists and turns, ebbs and flows that we love to watch until the expected happens.Demoting the less physically endowed to settle to a very restricted lifestyle.The men pursuing the attractive females and the woman the powerful men is another trait  that remains until our days.  Modified  in form but not essence.  A condition we can also relate and understand it's inception better, watching this period.Donald Sutherland's character is the icing on the cake.  He's just marvelous. As a father whose daughter's can confide for support, without the fear of a backlash of chauvinism.Smart enough to grasp the female soul is refreshing, specially on this context.I suggest this movie to all romantics at heart, who dare to be mocked and fooled.For the bravest of men, who dare or even indulge and see ""chick flicks"" proudly, beyond the purpose of scoring some points.And for anybody who likes beautiful photography, scenery and a well written piece."	4.0	A blueprint for all romance movies	2008-06-10	9	8	1

Wong	"I unfortunately saw this shortened version of ""Prejudice"" before seeing the acclaimed BBC TV one with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle--and yes if you want to quibble--the BBC one is the winner. But I'm still keeping this one because of Joe Wright's direction and the apt casting of Keira Knightley in one of her best roles to date.  The HD DVD copy is brilliant and all the colors of the English countryside make you feel that you're there.  Though Matthew McFadden may lack the irony of Colin Firth's gem like performance as Darcy, he is acceptable.  Regardless if you still have an HD DVD unit, this one is available at a very low price since no one is manufacturing them anymore.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ACOP3L51NKUE2	"Diane Kistler ""Writinglifer"""	Ok...so I've seen the movie ten times, downloaded the screensaver from the official site, bought the soundtrack from Amazon, and I'm reading interviews and the production notes (long, but fascinating), and also reading the book for the second time.Although Colin Firth was sensational in the miniseries, I think it's unfair to compare Matthew MacFadyen with other actors who have played the part. In one of MacFadyen's interviews, he said that you can't allow yourself to be intimidated. Just because great actors have played Hamlet, doesn't mean no one else can play the same character. Each actor brings his own art and interpretation to the character. Why do we have to choose? Can't we enjoy them all? That's what Roger Moore said during an interview when he was asked who was his favorite Bond. He said they are all good. Why do we have to choose?I also read somewhere that Colin Firth was making another movie during the BBC miniseries and had no idea that he was becoming such a sex symbol. He said he tried hard NOT to be sexy in this part.I think this movie version is visually stunning, the music is wonderful, and the dancing is exciting. I thought Simon Woods (Mr. Bingley) was adorable. I read that he and Rosa Pike (Jane Bennet) had gone together for some time and broke up a couple of years ago. Joe Wright, the director, wanted them both for these parts but was afraid it would be painful for them and uncomfortable on the set. But he chose them anyway. They didn't find out until the night before the first day of the shoot. Joe Wright and Rosa are now going together.I thought all the acting was very good, and although I had never heard of Matthew MacFadyen, I fell in love with him during the course of the movie, just as Lizzy did. I really think the most inspired acting job was the character of Mr. Collins. Tom Hollander played him as ridiculous and a bit creepy. I was happy to find his bio on the imdb and see that he is actually handsome, and sexy, with blond wavy hair. If he looked like himself in the movie, she may not have turned him down.This was Tamzin Merchant's (Georgiana) first acting part. She is a huge Jane Austen fan and wrote to the casting director that she would be perfect for that part. She even learned to play the piano.I, too, wish the movie was longer...perhaps another hour, and would like to have seen Mr. Wickham's character more developed.In the production notes, they thought of Darcy as a tragic/tortured character. His parents die while he is still young and he inherits this huge estate to manage and must raise a young sister. He had to take on a lot of responsibility at an early age.Keira Knightley says that the girls socialized easily with the cast, until they got dressed up. She said the men were so sexy in their outfits that the females couldn't even put sentences together.Austen's writing is an interesting style. It's not grammatically correct and there are spelling errors. But it's difficult to put the book down. Most of the text is dialogue. It reads like script. And the book is posted online in several places. If you missed some dialogue because the British accent, just check out the book online.Also in the production notes, they mention that Austen wrote P&P; during the French Revolution, where the underclass revolted against the upper class, and American just won  independence from England. At that time, the upper class was encouraged to socialize with the middle class to avoid unrest. Bingley had no problem, but Darcy and Caroline Bingley found it difficult.All in all, I think they did a beautiful job with the movie. I love the story and the characters. I'm anxious to see all versions. I own the Greer Garson/Lawrence Olivier version, the 6-hour miniseries, both Bridget Jones movies, and I can't wait until this DVD becomes available (February 2, I think). I also own an Austen boxed set of British productions (haven't seen them yet). I just saw the P&P; movie with Orlando Seale and Kam Heskin. It's so silly that it's actually funny. Haven't seen Bride and Prejudice yet, but it's on cable this month.	5.0	I'm Bewitched Body and Soul	2005-12-31	6	4	2

I appreciated the refreshing lack of profanity, crudity, and senseless violence that floods today's movies.Beautiful scenery, well acted - thoroughly enjoyable.

The Colin Firth version truly does justice to the story, which I now realize this version did not.Additionally in this version they have really taken some liberties in modernizing both the interactions (e.g. Elizabeth's wit takes on such a sarcastic, biting tone that it REALLY stretches my suspension of disbelief that a lady could have behaved in such a manner) as well as in the actions (e.g. Darcy walking into Elizabeth's private quarters at night, unannounced and with Elizabeth unattended).All that said, I've left it at 5 stars simply because as a standalone film, it's a wonderful story and a visual feast.

The A&E/BBC version with Colin Firth was fabulous, but takes almost 6 hours to watch. So, if you aren't looking for the whole story and have only a few hours, I definitely recommend this, but otherwise, take the time to watch the previously mentioned mini-series version.	3.0	Adequate for a movie length adaptation	2013-07-29	2	2	0

Keira is one of my favorites so i have no problem with her ability to work this role. It was her that led me to buy this movie, and am glad i did. my opinion is not the final say so by any means, i just know what i like. everything was done in good taste, and the scenic effects went right along with the movie. very moving, and entertaining.	5.0	A possible Classic	2013-06-29	1	1	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A24STMI37SEO18	DMarie	(Actually 4.5 stars but I rounded up)I absolutely loved the movie! I thought it was accurate to Austen's book especially given that the movie was just about 2 hours. You cannot obviously put in everything in the book in the movie unless it's a mini-series like the Firth piece. The movie didn't stray too far from the book like a lot of books-turned-into-movies do.Even though it was a bit dirty scenic wise, it was just the take of this particular director. I didn't let it impare my enjoyment of the film.My only slight flaw with it was initially the beginning moved quickly and for some friends and family who hadn't read the book, it took them a little while to catch on to everything. There were also a few artsy type scenes that confused me (Lizzie staring into the mirror forever, her standing on a the edge of a cliff) but again nothing to impare my enjoyment.I fully plan on buying this one!	5.0	Great movie for the time limit	2006-02-10	6	5	1

I've watched the BBC production of Pride and Predjudice and it was outstanding.  It is hard to imagine a better Mr. Darcy than Colin Firth.  I wanted to share this great story with my 11 year old daughter, and she has tried to watch the BBC production... but at 5+ hours, its very difficult for her to sit through, let alone understand. This latest adaptation is perfect for the newest generation of hopeful Jane Austen fans.  It has characters they recognize and can understand and it is considerable shorter than its BBC counterpart.  The setting and musical score are gorgeous, and although the story is not ""pure"" Jane Austen, it comes pretty darn close."	5.0	Great adaptation	2006-03-21	8	5	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1VV7MD14UNIAK	"Doggy Bird ""doggybird"""	I love movies and though I don't see a lot of first run films, I thought 2006 offered an unusual variety of interesting movies and made a special effort to see them in theaters.  Of all the films I saw last year, this is one of the few I felt I would want to see again and so I purchased it on DVD and have watched it a few times since my purchase.  In fact, now that it is being shown on HBO during the holiday season when I have more free time than usual, I have watched it several MORE times--which is very unusual for me.  But this has very quickly become one of my FAVORITE movies.I am a big Jane Austen fan and loved the Firth/Ehle 1995 production and also the earlier 1980 BBC production with David Rintoul which I used to introduce my daughter to Jane Austen several years ago.  I don't think it's all that relevant to this film to compare it to the TV productions since a TV miniseries can be so much more faithful to the novel itself given much longer playing time and less need for distinctive scenery and sets.In order to translate such a social novel successfully to the film screen, and in order to attract a more varied audience than those who faithfully appreciate Masterpiece Theater, dramatic visuals were needed and the sets and scenery took on much greater importance.  Also a much simpler story was imperative to fit in a two hour framework.  The choices made were admirable.  The scenery is so beautiful and so evocative of rural England, the acting is inspired, the dialogue is perfect and the drama moves quickly and holds the interest even of those highly unlikely to pick up and read a Jane Austen novel--even my husband, a comedy and adventure film fan, loves this movie.I think the relevant group to which this film should be compared are the other big award winners of 2006, and this is a FAR SUPERIOR film to many of the films which won big awards.  I was able to watch 'Walk the Line' a second time, and I HAD to watch 'Syriana' a second time to understand it all--they were both good films and I have to admit I even enjoyed Crash when I first saw it--but I would never bother to watch 'Crash' again, and I think this film gets better each time I see it.  Each time I watch it I see something new in the sets, in the performances, in the story, and in the direction.  I really cannot recommend the film more highly--it is tremendously enjoyable and can be watched by a wide variety of adults as well as older children.	5.0	My favorite movie of 2006	2007-01-13	9	5	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A33WEAD17NL83	DogLvr1116	I completely adored this movie adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel.  I must admit, I was weary when first seeing the previews because I am such a huge fan of both the book and the Colin Firth movie version.  But this movie was a complete joy from start to finish.  It was both funny and it moved a little quicker than the Colin Firth version (that one's about 4 hours longer!), though I thought it covered all the important plot points.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1M0QL8USJWMQP	Do_I_have_to?	"Wow. I love (LOVE) the BBC miniseries, and I adore Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. I also detest Kiera Knightly. Consequently, I went to the theatre expecting to be disappointed. I stand (sit, actually) corrected in the most vehement manner. I never would have believed it possible, but this is better than the BBC version. Matthew Macfadyen is better (!!!) than Mr. Firth was, and I will be very disappointed if Ms. Knightly does not win the Best Actress Oscar. To think I would ever say that, especially after her insipid performance in ""Pirates of the Caribbean!"" But, quite frankly, she deserves all the praise she has garnered for her performance as Elizabeth.Donald Sutherland plays Mr. Bennet with a sympathy that was completely lacking in the BBC version, and he quickly became my favorite character. (I must stop comparing the two films. They really are apples and oranges, so to speak.) Rosamund Pike. Wow. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Jane. She will forever embody the roll for me. I know that every time I read the book from now on, I will see her in my mind's eye every time Jane speaks. But quite honestly, the real standout, the actor who completely made the film (for me, at least) was Mr. Macfadyen. I was disappointed the first time I saw him. The second time, I decided he was ""not that bad."" By the end of the film (actually, by the time he proposes so horribly), I was completely in love with him (as Darcy, not as an actor), and wondered why on earth Lizzie would have refused his first proposal. Seriously.The cinematography is also breathtaking, and the soundtrack is next on my CD purchasing list. After that, of course, I will be buying the DVD on February 28. I am so glad I don't have to wait for months!"	5.0	I wish I could give it six stars.	2006-02-16	15	10	5

The dialogue was too sharp for a female even in this era and too witty for believability...what were the duties of all these people in even overseeing the workers, farming, cleaning, even Mr. Bennett just played with orchids and dragonflies, although loved Sutherland in the role...just rich people worried about balls n who has how much quid per year...and one last gripe, the bust of Darcy was exquisite but the back side looked hideous, did they run out of money for the most important piece in the gallery??? pithy items aside, I really fell in love with this film even tho the music score was limited and threaded simply throughout, the majestic mountain and the meeting at sunrise scenes remain in my heart n soul...they seemed very real and deep and poured through my body, wonderful feeling that compares to very few moments in film, my life, or imagination. Kiera is abs stunning except when she starts yelling after the Darcy proposal, her jaw looks too harsh and oh yes, the makeup at sunrise was waaay overdone...personally, that hottie that married  the youngest did not ever get enuff screen time IMHO ...	4.0	The Overture Theme truly elevates this film beyond faults...	2009-01-07	3	0	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2KDNKGMII8HWF	Donald L. Hardy	"Friends of mine -- all of whom know my great love for the novel -- insisted I see this film, in spite of my firmly stated desire not to do so.  I finally caved this weekend.  Big mistake.  This movie bears only a vague similarity of character names and basic plotline to Austen's novel.Visually, the film was more than a disappointment, it was a calamity.  The characters looked greasy, unkempt, and dirt poor.  I thought ""Am I watching Cold Comfort Farm? Are there pigs in the drawing room?  What IS this? And would someone please, PLEASE comb their hair!""  Costumes, sets, everything was far more suitable to a steampunk version of a Bronte mashup than a Regency period piece.In terms of character, one of the things everyone said to me was ""OMG, it captures the passion underlying the novel!  You must see it!  Flail, flail, flail!""  Well, actually, no, it didn't -- if throbbing passion actually underlies Pride and Prejudice (which I've never noticed it to do).  I thought Darcy and Elizabeth had little to no chemistry.  She seemed peevish the entire film, and he simply looked confused and indecisive.  No less baffled was Donald Southerland -- whom I hugely admire and respect -- in his turn as Mr. Bennet: a sad, defeated, broken man...definitely not something I'd ever read in the novel.  Georgiana, to my shock, was actually pert. PERT. I was speechless.Judi Dench, god bless her, was in a completely different film.  I really wanted to see that film.  Badly.  Unfortunately, I wasn't watching it.I won't comment much on the dialogue, as I know cramming a huge novel into two hours is a fairly impossible task, but to actually have Charlotte Lucas say ""Don't judge me, Lizzie, don't you dare judge me!"", or Elizabeth blurt, ""Mr. Darcy, what are you doing here!"" when she sees him at Rosings is so far beyond the pale, that the palings aren't even in sight any longer.Perhaps I was missing the director's, the actors', the designers', and the writers' point in this film, but all I felt I was missing was ""Pride and Prejudice.""In a word: dreadful."	1.0	The Harlequin Romance Version	2010-08-17	22	18	4

As at least one reviewer has mentioned, the rapidity and manner of speaking is, in a few places, hard to grasp. The ""rejection scene"" between Lizzie and Mr Darcy was particularly troublesome for me, but the subtitles and pause helped. Kept me captivated throughout.

Men being gentlemen, ladies being taken care of, and family/friendship being consideredwith highest regard.  Once I have some boys of my own, I will show them this movie for a perfect depiction of whata gentleman should look like.  Don't get me wrong, I by no means am some wussy guy who hides under pressure, hates confrontation or doesn't stand up for things.  I'm quite the opposite, my wife can back me on that haha  My point is, is that this generation (at least in my area) has very few gentlemen left, that are selfless, caring, and strong.  I believe when a woman is willing to be apart of any guys life, that that guy should do everything in his power to make her happy.  And what's amazing is that, the woman is so happy that she makes the man happy without even thinking about it!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ADS5APY1NKTL4	"D. Pawl ""Dani"""	"I have been a longtime Jane Austen convert, for as long as I can remember.  ""Pride and Prejudice,"" one of her most well-known and well-loved stories, has been brought to the screen a total of three times (prior to this new 2005 version).  The previous versions were made in 1940 (with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier), 1985 (with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul), and in 1996 (with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle).This new version, with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfayden, is intelligent, witty and very sensuous in its adaptation.  Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) is one of five daughters of the ""have not"" Bennett family, and her mother (Brenda Blethyn) is anxious to marry them off.  Once Elizabeth encounters Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden), a man who comes from great material wealth, but who lacks a lust for life, it is clear that the unlikely pair has been brought together for a reason, bigger than the both of them.This is an excellent character study and social commentary, on the state of the British class system and the pursuit of true love.  What's more, the actors in this film shine brightly and have great onscreen chemistry.  The photography is luscious, the story is engaging, and this is definitely NOT a chick flick.

This film is set when the book was written (Georgian England) not published (Victorian England), unlike the BBC version.  The difference is seen not just in the costumes, but in the manner of communicating.  In Georgian England, people were much more expressive.  Hence, the film is less subtle (also neccessary for a 2-hour version!) than the miniseries.  Give Macfayden a chance, he's no Colin Firth, but I think he communicates the ""he's not a snob, he's just shy"" aspect much better than Firth, who comes accross as simply arrogant for most of the BBC version."	5.0	Loved even by a fan of the BBC version	2007-09-14	3	2	1

Great acting, lots of drama. The only drawback is that the characters are developed pretty quickly. The BBC version does a better job of that but it is several hours long; their actors are not nearly as good either, in my opinion.

After having seen that one, this one seems so rushed (after all, it's only 1/3 as long) but the lead actors, Kiera Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen give their characters a bit different twist. Elizabeth is not as starched, while Mr Darcy is even more sensuous. Definitely more passionate. There is just ONE flaw to this movie (other than the fact it should have gone on forever!).

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2TXR85WQLE32N	D. S. Thurlow	"2005's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a skillful adaptation of Jane Austen's classic romance novel to the big screen.  Only a bold production team would have taken on the task, given the continuing and justified popularity of the 1996 BBC television version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  Taken on its own merits as a theatrical release, the 2005 version is visually stunning, includes wonderful location shooting and period detail, and offers two attractive leading actors with genuine on-screen chemistry.The storyline is familiar to Jane Austen fans.  The middle-class Bennet family, including its five eligible daughters and a scheming mother anxious to marry them off, learns that the wealthy Mr. Bingley will visit their small English village.  They meet Mr. Bingley at a village dance, where he is attracted to the beautiful and kind but reserved Jane Bennet.  Jane's spirited and headstrong sister Elizabeth is less impressed with Mr. Bingley's seemingly haughty friend Mr. Darcy.  Her disdain for his manners and his prejudice against Jane and against a militia officer whom she favors, will cause Elizabeth to angrily reject his surprise offer of marriage.  However, Elizabeth learns she may have been wrong about Mr. Darcy.  His generous efforts on behalf of Jane and of Elizabeth's eloped youngest sister will earn him a second chance.Keira Knightley is perfectly cast as the young and impertinent Elizabeth.  Matthew MacFadyen is very effective as the painfully shy and reserved Mr. Darcy.  Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn are a sympathetic Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.  The interaction of the Bennet sisters, including Rosamund Pike as Jane and Jena Malone as youngest sister Lydia, is authentic and by turns touching and hilarious.  Judi Dench personifies the ""dragon"" Lady Catherine DeBurgh.Adapting Pride and Prejudice to a two hour movie format means seriously compressing a treasured storyline. Under Director Joe Wright's sure hand, the movie steps briskly through the plot, keeping a tight focus on Elizabeth Bennet and her developing relationship with Mr. Darcy.  Among the key scenes: Elizabeth's chance encounter with Mr. Darcy at Pemberly; Mr. Bingley's proposal to Jane, reworked to bring out the humor and to make explicit Mr. Darcy's role; and Mr. Darcy's second proposal to Elizabeth.  The latter features a long atmospheric tracking shot as Mr. Darcy crosses a field at dawn to meet a surprised Elizabeth.  The next-to-last scene, in which Elizabeth requests permission to marry from her father, brings out the best in two very good actors.""Pride and Prejudice"" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen.  The Collectors Edition DVD Set includes a music score CD, production notes, some excellent background features, and Joe Wright's fascinating director's commentary."	5.0	A Beautiful Pride and Prejudice...	2008-02-15	5	4	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AYTYND5YOWIQI	"D. Trible ""dhtrible"""	The notion of not comparing this version to the mostly sublime 1995 version with Jennifer Ehle, Colin Firth, et al is simply ridiculous.  Does one not constantly use comparison as a basis for all judgements in life?  If you deny it, you are deceiving yourself.That said, the music and lighting and colors (cinematography shall we say, minus some instances of jiggly camera movement and disturbing slight zooms in and out) are almost always wonderful throughout this film.  Music + Cinematography = 4.8 Stars.  Beyond that, I was alternately cringing and smiling and the sum which was null.  The Rest = -0.8 Stars.  Thus Average = 2 Stars.It is not necessary to make a movie of a book just because you can.  There are many books, and this is one of them, that require more time to have justice done to their tales.  It's impossible (at least for me) to watch this movie without becoming frustrated, and that's not entertainment.  The dialog is mostly useless, in some parts you may find yourself wondering if the actors are actually being paid for their performances (it can't all be the fault of the screenplay can it?).  I found almost nothing enlightening in this version except for the aforementioned music and cinematography.  I agree with the negative criticism in other reviews of this version of P&P; but will not take the space to repeat it here.I hardly ever write reviews, but I felt irrepressably compelled speak out and warn would-be buyers of this film (probably because I bought it because of the high average rating) - rent it first!!If you've never read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or seen any other film versions, I encourage you to at least read the book first, and if you must watch this film version first, then afterwards see the 1995 version.  If you're also a Jane Austen-phile and sort of liked this movie, listen to the commentary - some comments will really drive you up the wall, and perhaps cool your opinion of this rendition!  Since I now own it, I'll watch it again and see if I can find any other redeeming qualities...however I sincerely doubt that I'll increase my rating...p.s.1.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3NBI2EBVSW65N	Duchiffre	"This is a magnificent production. The cinematography is pure art and can compete with the great paintings of the past: I think I have never seen the like of it. Some deviations are made from the book, all seemingly in order to obtain those stunning images - Darcy's proposal for instance is made under a solemn, late 18th century garden ""temple""; in the pouring rain, rather than prosaically in the small cottage guest room she occupies at Lady de Bourgh's; the denouement is even more torn out of any convention, but it yields the strongly symbolic mage of two lovers in grassland embracing amidst haze and dew against the rising morning sun: I buy it.I cannot vouch for the story's consistency because I know both the book and the superb 1995 BBC series too well to be able to imagine learning the story by way of this motion picture. Other than that, the acting is superb; Keira Knightly (with a name like that, when is she going to do Emma???) magnificently portrays both the serious and frivolous sides of an intelligent and wise 22 year old; Matthew Macfadyen had to grow on me (and who in the world can top Colin Firth's plunge in the pond of his castle?) but convinces; Donald Sutherland, though in my view a miscast, is his superb self; and Judy Dench places a most formidable and implacable Lady Catherine. Everyone else is thoroughly enjoyable.The music is well done, fortunately with period players (the English Concert): what a chance, nowadays, for a film director to depict musicians the way they played in the time of the story! This period playing is combined with 21st century music depicting the characters' emotions, and all is amalgamated into a good whole. The costumes are very well done too, maybe a bit too upscale (difference is made though between the rich and the less so), but they blend better into the stunningly gorgeous pictures than (perhaps) simpler, more realistic clothing would.One of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.I wonder if Keira's blowing out a candle somewhere in the middle of the movie is a small wink at Jennifer Ehle in the BBC production, who does the same, in pretty much the same way."	5.0	Stellar	2013-04-15	1	0	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2TJUA7LY9YWOD	DudeemKnight	For those of you who loved the 1995 BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth (I'm an avid fan myself), please don't shy away from this utterly gorgeous rendition of Jane Austen's classic.  It isn't an improvement in any way on the 1995 version; it's simply a different interpretation that demonstrates how much richness Austen's book held, with which future adaptations could work.Where the 1995 version is, I believe, more faithful to the book's dignified, staid and old-fashioned but universal tone, this version sparkles with the eagerness and blunt sincerity of youth.  Miss Elizabeth Bennett still is a mature young lady, but she is much more fun-loving and a little less confident than Jennifer Ehle's portrayal of Elizabeth.  But both versions are beautiful.  Keira Knieghtly brings a suprising depth of thoughtfulness to her role, whereas Jennifer Ehle brought a maturity that was beyond maternal to hers.  Where Jennifer Ehle stressed Elizabeth as the lofty standard of reason, poise and discernment, Keira Knieghtly stresses Elizabeth's honest, refreshing, witty and intelligent manners.  Both adaptations are superbly rendered.The scenery in this version was also stunning - you should see this film for that alone.  The scenes are also very cleverly shot, with novel imagery that draws you into this by-gone period.  I walked out of the cinema feeling as though I had just landed back into the 21st century; that's how real it was.I also really appreciated the broodiness underlying this film.  There was a moody, cloudier aspect to the scenery that brought a pensive thoughtfulness to the production.  I felt as though I were really in England.  In the BBC 1995 production, every day was sunny.  The play of the natural elements in this version formed an intricate background to the tumult of inner emotions that the film portrayed so finely.  This film could be analyzed over and over for the many different threads its makers very skilfully used to weave a rich, gorgeous tapestry of an experince.You will be transported.	5.0	Rich truffles for the eye and mind	2006-04-28	22	15	7

I am so happy this movie has been made.  There's so much pressure on any actor playing Mr. Darcy after Collin's portrayl.  However, McFayden (sp?) has nailed this part.  Keira is a much better Elizabeth than Jen Ehle (sp?).  As much as I love Jen's acting, it's hard to pretend she's not at least 30 years old at the time of filming.  (I dont know how old she was, but she was made to look at least 30 imho).  I loved the scene under the rain, it looked like Darcy could barely contain himself from grabbing Elizabeth, and she looked like she wouldnt mind that at all  LOL.  I know, this is not a very intelligent or insightful review, but I'm so delighted with the movie...  I cant wait to buy the dvd.	5.0	Another Brilliant Adaptation	2005-12-08	11	9	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2DBFIG8396SYL	DVR	"I love Pride and Prejudice (the novel and the A&E; miniseries) most ardently. Joe Wright's adaptation will likely disturb Austenites, so consider yourselves warned and need not watch :) I believe it is also pointless to compare a 2-hr adaptation to any of the 4 1/2 hr versions. So, if you get over that and you would like  a movie to entertain you with breathtaking cinematography, adorable updated dialogues, deft acting, and a musical score that inspires without being overwhelming, then this is for you.The central cast is younger than previous adaptations but equally brilliant. Knightley truly has Elizabeth's  ""fine eyes,"" but not distractingly beautiful, expressive but not deliberate. MacFadyen unfolded Darcy's in a compelling manner; proud but endearingly awkward, confident yet reticent, elegant yet subtly sexy (and I love, love, love his eyes).Cons: 1. the heavy reliance of the film to imagery and nuances (in the novel and in other adaptations, most of the P and P elements are presented as dialogues; follow the camera's movement and be very observant!)3. use of the napoleonic era timeline, as oppose to the more aesthetic victorian era backdrop that P and P fans have gotten used toPros: 1. use of the napoleonic era timeline; makes the film less stodgy, less pompous, more grounded2. fresh take on the classic but most romantic; the display of emotions are more intense  (a more spirited Elizabeth, a less elegant Darcy-in-love; Jane is less sedate and a fleeting scene that shows Bingley reaching for Jane's dress, desperate for any form of physical contact)3. a sense of urgency was captured without the abuse of a nattering Mrs. Bennet4. my favorite: unusual for his countenance, Mr. Darcy comes out disheveled in his night clothes and desperately seeks Elizabeth through the mist. It is a powerful show of yearning that romantics will find gratifyingI find most happy endings in romantic films to be contrived, but this is one romantic film where I found myself hoping and staying for the kiss."	5.0	Not Austen but most invigorating!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AC1K4OQOZ90RS	"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10"""	"""Pride and Prejudice,"" directed by Joe Wright, is a beautifully mounted version of the beloved Jane Austen classic.  Gorgeously filmed on location in England, the movie stars Keira Knightley as the spirited Elizabeth Bennet.  Knightley has luminous eyes, a wickedly mischievous smile, and a saucy manner.  The director wisely zooms in on her captivating face in a number of tight close-ups.  Matthew MacFadyen plays Mr. Darcy as an aloof and sullen gentleman, who hides his smoldering sexuality beneath a stolid facade.  Brenda Blethyn is appropriately dithery as the nervous and silly Mrs. Bennet, a mother of five daughters who is desperate to marry her children off to men of means.  Mr. Bennet, played solidly by Donald Sutherland, frequently hides in his study in order to get a respite from his noisy and high-spirited brood.  Also noteworthy are Tom Hollander as the stuffy and pompous Mr. Collins; his pursuit of Elizabeth is met with undisguised disdain.  Dame Judi Dench is formidable in her cameo as the imperious and overbearing Lady Catherine de Bourg. Less successful are the miscast Simon Woods, who turns in a nerdy performance as the carrot-topped Mr. Bingley, and Rosamund Pike, as Jane Bennet, is lovely to look at but a bit too vapid.Roman Osin, the cinematographer, captures the lush beauty of the English countryside and the glamor of Darcy's and Bingley's estates.  The camera is always in motion, panning over the dancers in a ballroom, a breathtaking sunset, a rainy field, and the expressions on the characters' faces.  There is rarely a dull moment in this film. Unfortunately, the dialogue is sometimes difficult to follow because the Wright frequently directs his actors to speak over one another.  In addition, unlike Dench, whose diction is impeccable, some of the performers speak too quickly and fail to enunciate.Another quibble is that the screenwriter, Deborah Moggach, gives short shrift to  Austen's underlying themes of snobbery, social stratification, and the constraints of women in eighteenth century England.  These issues are certainly implied, but they are peripheral to Elizabeth and Darcy's romance, which takes center stage. Still, this movie is a treat for the mind and heart. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is an enchanting, wildly romantic, and entertaining love story that will please all but the most finicky Austen purists."	4.0	Lush and lovely adaptation.	2005-11-23	12	9	3

They strayed from the text a bit too much for my taste - demerit.  They rattled off their brilliant lines too quickly - demerit (particularly Keira Knightly).  I was disappointed by her performance overall, although I do like her aesthetically and even cerebrally as Elizabeth.On the plus side - Matthew Macfadyen made a wonderful Darcy.  Also the cinematography was absolutely lovely, as was the artistic direction.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2R7RMWUXDJISH	ED Denson	"I never thought I would understand Pride & Prejudice enough to critique the film adaptations but some unexpected leisure in the past couple of months has allowed me to see them all. The 1940 Greer Garson is good - indeed all 4 are good although widely different. The Keira Knightly is the best, however, both because of her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet, and because of the warmth of the film maker's conception of the Bennet family.  Of course it is the portrayal of Lizzy that makes or breaks the film, and this is my favorite portrayal, and my pick of the best of the 4.  Keira Knightly is my favorite Elizabeth. She is younger than the other actresses who have played Elizabeth,  and plays a Elizabeth Bennet closer to the 20 year old we read about in the novel. I would not call her beautiful - indeed in this film Jane is the most beautiful of the 5 Bennet sisters, just as she is supposed to be. But Keira is unbelievably attractive because of her facial expressions. She has a marvelous smile and we see a lot of it, and, like Garson, her face can show her emotions and their changes so well that soon you are completely engrossed in her character and her story. As they used to say, ""You'll laugh, you'll cry, but you'll never forget Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet.""This version also manages to allow Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) to be his sarcastic and witty self without being unpleasant. He is played too harshly in some other versions, especially the 1979 BBC adaptation.  The Bennet family holds together quite well, even Mrs. Bennet is redeemed, although with some dialog that is definitely not in the novel.  Darcy is almost impossible to cast, I suspect. Certainly in this film he is no better than acceptable. Mr. Collins, on the other hand, is very good, although his part is much cut down in the interest of getting a 2 hour film. (We do get to hear a short sample of his preaching). The only unhappy casting is that of Wickham. Wickham is a sociopath, and should have a great deal of charm when he meets Lizzy. Here he is more whiner than charmer. All 3 of the other film makers were able to find someone to fit the bill, but here Keira's boyfriend, I believe, got the part, and he is simply wrong for it. Luckily his role is also quite reduced from that in the novel so we don't see him often enough to be disturbed greatly.So, for those characters that survived the scriptwriter, this is the best cast of the 4 adaptations, and the most sympathetic to the Bennet family. Who is missing? Aunt Phillips and ""broad faced stuffy Uncle Phillips, breathing port wine."" Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, Maria Lucas (well really, excepting Charlotte, Sir William and all the Lucases are missing), Mr. & Mrs. Gardiner's children are gone, although the Gardiners do get to take Lizzy to Pemberly, Mrs. Hill is gone, Mrs. Young is gone, and Mrs. Ainisley is gone,  as are all of the Officers from the ____Shire militia (we see anonymous officers dancing, but no Denny,  and no Col. Forster except by mention. We do not go to London with Jane, or Ramsgate with Georgiana, and never were going to the Lakes. We do get a milita parade, quite a bit of poultry, one Wuthering Heights like view of Lizzy standing in the wind atop a cliff which they would do well to edit out of the film, Darcy's proposal in a faux-temple during a rainstorm, and absolutely the best Assembly Ball ever filmed.  The director's commentary is quite interesting, too.Do you remember the Polanski film where our heroes are pretending to be the living dead, and at a zombie ball they dance down the room until suddenly they come upon a mirror and, being alive, they are reflected in it but none of the other dancers are?  Here when Mr. Darcy dances with Lizzy their conversation becomes so intense that the other dancers vanish for a couple of minutes and we just have our couple dancing alone in the ballroom. I don't know that the scenes connect in any other way but one scene calls forth the other to me.So aside from Wickham, what problems? Everyone compresses the sequence of events at the end, but here someone piled them up and stomped on them. Bingley returns to Netherfield, proposes in the afternoon, Lady Catherine arrives around midnight, and at the next dawn Lizzy and Darcy meet in a foggy field and become engaged. Poor Mr. Collins' letter never arrives, as you can imagine. Where could it have fit in? In about 16 hours of one day, we see what took weeks in the novel. Most bothersome is the visit to Pemberly. Lizzy becomes detached from the Gardiners, wanders off alone in the house, and hearing piano playing,  peeks through a door and sees Georgiana playing, then she sees Darcy enter and his sister and he embrace, till he looks up and sees Elizabeth peeping in at them. That's bad enough, (and quite out of character)  but then she walks back to Lambton without the Gardiners and without looking for them. Is it possible that they did not realize that she was no longer with them as they went through the house?  Still, one can excuse these little things. If we put up with Caroline Bingley's ""fat suit"" costume in the Garson version, we can put up with almost anything.My advice? Buy all 4 versions, book a transatlantic cruise, and give each version one full sea-day to watch and consider. I think you'll find yourself agreeing with me that the Keira Knightly film is the best, and you'll be happy you watched the others."	4.0	Probably the Best Film Adaptation of the 4	2011-06-15	3	2	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A908AYEUMIKRW	"Eden Waters ""teenageanglophile"""	"To begin with I must praise how beautiful the film was. The pictures of the English countryside and some of the pictures of Elizabeth and Darcy were breathtaking. The music was also very moving and fantastic. But that's about all the good I can get out of it. I can simply not see Kiera Knightley as Elizabeth. She doesn't have the same wit and is on the point of tears many, many times at places where a true Elizabeth would have just been laughing in her head. Another complaint is when they first arrive at Pemberly, Elizabeth lets out this quaverly laugh and then says nothing else. It looks like she's going insane, very strange. Her mother as portrayed a bit too lightly and definitely not as annoying. They parents seem to love each other, which if you have read the book, they don't. The younger sisters Kitty and Lydia are very good for their parts. Mr. Wickham looks so much like Orlando Bloom it's scary and you don't really feel as if you know him.  Charlotte Lucas has scripting problems. She is a wonderful actress and I feel she is wonderful for the part, but the scripting doesn't do her justice. It makes her seems to much like a 20-th century woman. The quote ""So don't judge me"" in a reference to her conversation with Elizabeth when she explains her decision to marry Mr. Collins is the main example. Matthew Macfayden is possibly the best portrayal for the whole movie, with the exclusion of Charlotte Lucas. He seems to be much more attractive in this movies, both physically and emotionally. My only complaint is that he seems almost depressed at points instead of reserved. As to what I would do with this movie is buy the dvd, put in in a computer and take screen takes out, create my own movie with the soundtrack music so I could just enjoy what I wanted too.My personal reccomendation  for a good version of Pride and Prejudice is to get the 1975 BBC version. I feel that as far as wit and age it is the best portrayl. The 1995 version has some problems, such as two scenes that wouldn't have happend in the 1800's, the age of the actors as compared with the ages of Elizabeth and Darcy and my main complaint is that every hint of wit between Elizabeth and Darcy seems calculated to wound whereas Elizabeth meant to be rude and somewhat cutting, but not the that degree. One note that may bother you is that my recommended version doesn't not contain as much scripting from the book as the 1995 version."	3.0	Beautiful, but not Pride and Prejudice	2006-08-28	12	8	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1AFP42XRGHAYF	"E. D. Lavoie ""Pink Piggy"""	For an adaptation, this is a very good movie. I've seen some other movies that practically changed the story. This one stays close to the original story, even though it skipped some details. Great scenery, great actors. Macfadyen is terrific as Darcy! He made us felt for Darcy. However, the movie failed to tell us some important things. I read the novel, and I understand that it's not possible to fit everything in a 2-hour movie. But, I think Darcy's personality was not explored enough. He was actually proud, he was, at first, looking at Lizzy only to criticize. The novel explains that he was raised to be like that. He's the only son, and for many years he was the only child. He was spoiled. He would have stayed like that had he not met Lizzy. I think this detail would help us understand his struggles even better.I am personally impressed by the music. It really works with the story. Being a piano player and singer myself, I really enjoyed the music. Bravo!I wouldn't endorse sequels. The story is beautiful as it is. Don't ruin it.

I must say, I was sorely disappointed in it.  It in NO manner can compare with the BBC's version. Although normally I am a fan of Keira Knightly, in my opinion, she truly lacked in her portrayal of Austin's Elizabeth Bennet.  Similarly, Matthew Macfadyen is just NO Colin Firth, who plays Darcy as no other.  For anyone that has not yet seen this movie, perhaps this version would suffice.. but my advise is to buy the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version from 1995.

However, first-time feature director Joe Wright and first-time screenwriter Deborah Moggach (with uncredited assistance from Austen adaptation veteran Emma Thompson) have brought youthful vigor and a wild, Thomas Hardy-like element to the movie, and as a whole, it works very well. It almost makes the overly familiar novel feel revitalized.For those who have forgotten their required high school reading, the story focuses on the downscale Bennet family - a passive father and a domineering mother, the latter intent on marrying off their five daughters to wealthy families. Eldest daughter Jane becomes smitten with rich but somewhat weak-willed Mr. Bingley and the bookish Mary keeps to her piano, while the two youngest daughters, Kitty and Lydia, are giggly and boy-crazy. On the other hand, the headstrong Elizabeth wants marriage on her terms with an intellectual equal, and she becomes alternately repelled and drawn to the brooding Mr. Darcy. There are several plotlines that interweave precariously toward the inevitable conclusion, but Austen's witty, often insightful dialogue holds the story together organically with grace and humor.Twenty-year old Keira Knightley is the youthful embodiment of Elizabeth, as her predecessors, Garson in particular, always strike me as too mature for the role. With her beauty subdued in casual period fashion, she manages to convey all the necessary facets of her personality with a natural &eacute;lan. As Darcy, Matthew Macfayden captures the moody character's insolence and growing romanticism with little affectation. Most all of the supporting players shine with Brenda Blethyn as the exasperating Mrs. Bennet, Donald Sutherland as her introspective husband, Tom Hollander as the priggish Mr. Collins, Rosamund Pike as beautiful and likable Jane, Jena Malone convincingly British as the impulsive Lydia, and of course, in all her scene stealing glory, Judi Dench lends acidic vinegar as Lady Catherine, Darcy's disapproving aunt.Parts of the film have a subtly stylized quality, such as the way the camera seems to track uninterrupted during the Assembly Hall ball sequence or when Elizabeth's head spins symbolically as she sits on a swing. There are also many well-turned tableaux-style shots that imbue the spirit of the period with vivid but unobtrusive detail. Credit should go to Roman Osin's textured and sumptuous cinematography, Jacqueline Durran's authentic-feeling costumes and Dario Marianelli's flavorful music, all of which capture a decidedly realistic though ultimately romanticized 16th-century England.The DVD package has several too-short features that provide some background into the production and Austen's characters but hardly enough to provide meaningful insight. Wright provides sometimes interesting commentary on an alternate track that borders a bit on the effusive, and there is an alternative and thankfully excised ending which spells out the plot resolutions unnecessarily. This movie is a joyous celebration of Austen's artistry as a writer whose story themes resonate today.	5.0	Robust Adaptation of Familiar Austen Novel Is One First-Class Production	2006-03-20	19	14	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3SRFWTLZSHF61	E. Hutchings	Although the English landscapes are beautifully portrayed, this film itself falls short of its ambitions. Elizabeth Bennet is Jane Austen's most popular heroine, and to see her portrayed so tackily is a shame. The saccharine romantics will still gush over the script that mimics Austen's story, but more discriminating viewers will not appreciate the liberties taken with the novel.Elizabeth Bennet is an intelligent woman and an astute observer of social refinements. In the novel, one is never embarrassed by her--instead, one is embarrassed on her behalf because of the indiscretions of her mother, sisters, and sometimes even father. However, in the movie, she too closely resembles her mother and Lydia, the gross embarrassments of the family and community. Where is the elevation between the two sisters? In the novel, Lydia's character is grossly ignorant of propriety, and is written that way for a reason: to show how intelligent and refined Elizabeth is, despite low family connections or lack of wealth. To see Elizabeth brought nearer Lydia's level is unforgiveable, and the movie, regardless of how beautifully filmed cannot recover from it.	1.0	Sadly, a butchery of Austen's best work...	2006-07-15	68	49	19

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3J2884YRDF5X4	"Eileen Dunlap ""P and P fan"""	I may not be a movie critic, but I do enjoy movies and versions of Pride and Prejudice are a particular favorite.  I admit I am a Firth fan from way back but am always open to new interpretations and this one is probably the strangest and worst one I have ever seen.  Like Shakespeare, Austen's works can be easily and effectively adapted to many time periods.  I have see most if not all of the Austen-based movies and have enjoyed their charm as well as change of scenery and time periods.  The themes she utilizes are universal.That being stated, this version is down right bizarre.  I understood a two hour movie would never have all the details needed to do this novel justice, however, when you start changing the customs, dicta, societal rules of the time peroid, you have ruined a major part of the story.  Since many other reviewers have gone into detail about the plot, I will refrain from any retelling.Luckily for the audience, a lot of Lizzie's words were cut, especially her dialogue concerning being a gentleman's daughter.  Barefoot, wandering around in thin night clothes at dawn (this is cold, damp England by the way, not sunny California) and watching swine run through what looked like a part of the Bennet house, especially a house that truly needed a make over was odd enough, but Darcy apparently did not have a valet or anyone that was concerned about his grooming or public appearance.  (Neither did Mr. Bennet.)  Is this the best English society has to offer?Overall, the acting that was shown (who knows what all is on the cutting room floor) was good.  The actors worked with what they had but I wonder if any of the actors had any clue what the director's vision really was.The part that bothered me the most had to be the midnight carriage ride of Lady Catherine.  What English lady (or any member of the gentry) would take a 50 mile ride in the dark?  No street lamps between Rosings and Longbourne, never mind the robbers, beggars, and other criminals that would be out at night, leaving Lady C with no protection other than the few footmen she might of had with her(Of course, you have no way of knowing how Lady C actually got to Longbourne).  And to top all that off, Lady Catherine was not even offended that Lizzie did not change clothes to talk to her.  Oh please, the rules of English society were not lax by any means and they got even stricter as time goes by until after WWII.  Add onto that the dawn meeting between Lizzie and Darcy in a field somewhere (in night clothes and very casual attire on Darcy's part) and you have truly entered a bizarre (definitely not an English society) world.  Lizzie's visit to Pemberly and the (non-portrait)sculpture gallery with the nudes amongst the bust of Darcy would never have been tolerated by Darcy himself(for Geogianna would never have been allowed to see any of the statutes, even of her brother, but they did portraits of people, not sculpture during that time period)much less non-married visitors of Pemberly.  (Did they feel that gave them the sex they needed for the movie?)If you want to modernize P&P;, go ahead, have at it, but don't modernize it in the same time period and change all the rules, customs and dicta of the time period.  Movies in the last 20-30 years have consistently gotten better about creating accurate time portrayals when you look at movies in this genre.  The golden years of Hollywood were not very accurate, but they did not really even try, so it is not really an issue.  But in the 21st century, we have the knowledge and ability to know those rules, customs and dicta, so why trash them to make a quick buck.  The BBC series at least tried to do Austen justice.  No movie can ever totally create what we the reader are envisioning, but a movie can be accurate with known facts.This movie did an incredibly poor job at recreating this world.  The actors did a good job, but that is the only reason why I can give this two stars.	2.0	Does anyone really know what time(period) this is?	2006-02-21	37	21	16
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A23HVL8F1L8YS8	Ekaterina Smoldyreva	This film is worth watching for its beautiful picture more than for anything else. Each shot looks like it has been taken from a painting of a period. Congratulations to the director and cameraman. The acting was good, the casting was good too, with some minor exceptions.It was the interpretation of the story which made me cringe from time to time. Was it really necessary to insert quite a lot of the awkward modern dialogue and the ways of expression into the story to show that it's topical? The director could express himself and convey the social message of the story without distorting the ways and customs of the past and adapting the story to modern ways.For one, could you ever imagine a grand lady of the society bursting into somebody's house in the middle of the night even if the matter was urgent?? Is it really necessary to take such radical measures to emphasize the character's personality? Sometimes I thought there was too much explained and too vividly expressed what could have been left to understand.On the other hand, the story was not very well developed, concentrating on Lizzy alone and leaving behind some important characters. We do not fully comprehend the drama of Lydia's escape with a man as we do not see in the full the wickedness of Mr. Whickam. Concequently, untouched is the theme of the goodness and just appearance of it as well as some other important messages. The story was quckly flowing from scene to scene without allowing the spectator to be involved.Moreover, almost all of the book characters appeared in the film; some, for a second only, after disappearing forever. This only crowded the film and left the residue of unsatisfaction, for you expect the story line to develop somehow in connection with the newly introduced character. True, the director didn't have much time at his disposal, well then... I know some big volumes transferred into the film media without losing their impact. If the director wanted to introduce a new, different interpretation of the story, he succeded only in modernizing dialogue and changing visual style, but his message is quite weaker than the original.On the whole, it is a pleasant production and does deserve an apprisal (for its picture mostly). However, the impeccable version of the book has been already made - 1995 BBC miniseries, and... what's the point in remaking the perfect?!	4.0	Beautiful picture though	2006-02-20	8	4	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AEP9B1RXNH5AA	Elaine	First time I saw this a few years ago I was crazy about it and watched it twice thru. Recently after the Downton Abbey craze which I jumped fully into, I had the yearning to revisit this story because it is so similar, all about &#34;entailed property&#34; and women's lack of rights and social castes, which persist today. It's almost the same story. When the Downton Abbey season ended I was bereft. So I rented the Colin Firth version, the BBC miniseries, which others always compare to this movie. I fell deeply into that telling too; such a wonderful transporting viewing experience! *sigh* Lol. I got into a Jane Austen frenzy and read a lot about her and the book and so decided to see this movie yet again! And I was shocked by the difference. Suddenly I realized that this Keira Knightly version is quite untrue to the original story, while the miniseries is much closer. Ultimately the only good version of Pride and Prejudice is the book itself, truly, which I find more hypnotic than any video representation. I listen to the Audible version while walking my dog. It's great. One thing that highlights the failure in both this movie and the miniseries is that Mr. Bennet loved his wife and considered her beautiful. That is established in the very beginning. From both movies you get that Mrs. Bennet is a crazy idiot that he only tolerates! Both cast her as old, with old actresses, when actually I think she would have been in her early 40's, maybe even 39. Jane Austen pokes gentle fun at her in the book but the movies really trash her and for that reason I will only trust my own interpretation of this great story, from the book itself. But I wouldn't say don't watch this movie. Keira Knightly is luminous and fantastic and adorable. And I fell in so love with Matthew McFadyen. Definitely watch the movie, but know it is not the real Pride and Prejudice.	3.0	Surprisingly disappointing	2013-05-18	1	1	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AC4OS65DJPQMN	E.L. Cruz	This film takes place in rural England during the 18th century. My favorite actress Keira Knightley plays the witty and head-strong Elizabeth Bennett, the second eldest of five daughters who come from a modest family. The daughters have reached marriagable age, and when the handsome, wealthy Mr. Bingley comes to town, of course the whole household flies into an uproar. Elizabeth's older and stunningly beautiful sister Jane (who is played by Audrey Tautou look-alike Rosamund Pike) is established as the inteded for Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth meets her match in Mr. Bingley's best friend, Mr. Darcy, whose dark wit and forlorn manner somehow spark her interest, but when a series of misunderstandings arise that involve her beloved family, Elizabeth must learn to put aside her pride or else risk losing the man who completes her.This movie was exquisite and beautifully directed. The sweeping, epic shots and stunning cinematography served as the perfect backdrop for the delicate love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightley's performance as Elizabeth was so amazing that it should serve as the standard for all romantic heroines. The chemistry created by lingering glances and touches is electrifying, and conveys the love arising bewteen Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy more fully than covert displays of affection that afflict many movies made today.So utterly romantic and heart-felt. One of the best films I've seen in a very long time.	4.0	One of the most romantic movies I've ever seen	2006-05-14	15	9	6
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A31T5ANGT3NCDR	elena maria vidal	"Over the years, there have been different film versions of Jane Austen's novel ""Pride and Prejudice."" I enjoy the diverging portrayals of the House of Bennet, where the Salic Law prevails, for new insights into the array of characters can always be gleaned. It is like visiting the same family in different seasons. I must admit that to me the 1995 BBC version was so excellent that I thought nothing else could compare, which is why the viewing of the 2005 rendition was postponed until a couple of days ago. With stunning cinematography and meticulously detailed sets, it is a highly entertaining production. Keira Knightley, although she is too thin for period roles when women were more fleshy, played the part of Elizabeth quite well. The other sisters and Mrs. Bennet were very well-cast. Donald Sutherland utterly stole the show. Sutherland's Mr Bennet seems to be in his own world yet he is really more in tune with everything that is going on than poor distracted Mrs. Bennet. That is especially evident from the way he goes over and comforts poor Mary at the Netherfield ball.The musical score is quite romantic, capturing the desperation of young love obstructed by such obstacles as money and status. The attraction between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is more palpable than ever, although they hardly ever touch except when dancing. Those days of strict boundaries and protocols certainly make for some great love stories.In the 2005 version, the Bennets seem more like yeomen farmers than landed gentry, with pigs running through the house, and shabby dresses. Were the Bennets really that poor? Maybe they were. On the other hand, Mr. Darcy is raised to the peerage, living at Chatsworth like the Duke of Devonshire. The Darcys were a distinguished and wealthy family but I doubt that they had the Elgin marbles in the parlor. This was only a minor distraction (along with the few weak attempts at vulgar humor) in a wonderful film which brings the viewer into the world of the late 1700's, the world of Jane Austen, when young men knelt to ladies when proposing marriage, and being a penniless old maid was the fate worse than death."	4.0	Visiting the Bennets Once Again	2008-04-06	3	2	1

The inward struggle of both Darcy and Elizabeth is portrayed so well. There are a few elements that were explained in this adaptation that were not addressed in the Firth/ Ehle adaptation. Charlotte Lucas's reasoning for marrying Mr. Collins for example and the mother's obsession with getting her daughters married off. The father was much more loving to all of his family and over all; the characters and situations were more realistic. The scenery, music, and filming were beautiful. I own and love the first movie however to get the complete story I think it is necessary to view both. If you haven't seen the Firth P&P or read the book, don't watch this until you have.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1BY89JC6JOAC5	Eliza Bennet	A charming, wonderful movie in its own right.  Brilliantly cast, and well acted.  I loved it.  It captures the essence of Pride and Prejudice.  I didn't want it to end when it was over.  It was filmed beautifully.  And if it wasn't my favorite book, if I didn't know the story so well, I probably wouldn't have noticed the `rushing' through the storyline.  Feelings aren't developed, can't be developed, within this kind of a short format.  Circumstances and emotions that took days, weeks, or months to develop in the book seem to transpire instantaneously in this movie.  The passage of time is not well represented.  Some characters that definitely add depth are cut out of the plot completely.  Where is Mr. Hurst, for example, eating, drinking, and sleeping to excess?  Mrs. Hurst?  Charlotte's sister Maria?  Aunt Phillips?  Mr. Collins doesn't get to develop his idiosyncracies appropriately.  And my favorite narcissist of all time, Lady Catherine De Bourgh, played by a phenomenal actress this time out (Dame Judi Dench), doesn't get to fuss, brag, and command as she ought.  If you want the nuance, the humor, and the character development, you have to read the original book or watch either the BBC or the A&E production.  However, this was a delightful movie taken alone, without comparison.  This adaption would be an especially good introduction to Pride and Prejudice.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3BFKY618DR43K	Elizabeth A. Root	"Someone on another website (I regret that I cannot give the reference) commented aptly that in this movie, Longbourne looks  like Stella Gibbons'Cold Comfort Farm (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition).  This was an amusing enough costume flick, but a pretty poor interpretation ofPride and Prejudice (Bantam Classics)so I recommend that Jane Austen fans tell themselves that they are not watching the Bennets, they are watching the Georgian-era Starkadders.  (I strongly recommend the offbeat Cold Comfort Farm as both a novel and a movie:Cold Comfort Farm).The problem with this movie is not so much that it is short, but that what is retained is frequently rendered inane.  Instead of handing his letter to Lizzie while she is out walking, the half-dressed Darcy breaks into the Collins' house in the middle of the night and surprises nightgown-clad Lizzie in her dark bedroom (and she doesn't even scream.)  One of the pivotal scenes in the book is Lizzie Bennet's hearing praise of Darcy from his housekeeper.  This is eliminated in favor of a dopy scene of her wandering around a collection of marble nudes, as if perhaps, the problem was with her libido and this fixed it.  The corny last scene made me glad the movie was ending.  I have read that this is not in the British edition; perhaps they are still trying to punish Americans for the revolution.  In addition, someone apparently decided that it would be hysterically funny if people were constantly interrupting the Bennets.  So instead of Mr. Collins proposing after breakfast, he starts his proposal during breakfast and Mrs. Bennet makes everyone but Lizzie leave the table.  Darcy wakes everyone up before dawn to ask for Lizzie's hand - I don't recommend this as a way to endear yourself to prospective in-laws.  Lady Catherine shows up in the middle of the night, wakes up all the Bennets, and then has it out with Lizzie in front of her family - really smooth and discreet.  People in this era avoided driving at night when they could - they didn't have halogen street lights all over the place, it was very dark at night and travelling could be very dangerous.The depiction of the period is very uneven.  I had a bad feeling about this movie when I saw the tie-in book featuring Darcy walking around half-dressed, looking a lot more like Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights.  I cannot understand the argument that this is a modern retelling when it is still set in the Regency.  Or that it is somehow more suited to a present-day audience than the A&E; (Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)) and BBC (Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980)) productions.  There are a number of novels that have rewritten Pride and Prejudice as a contemporary story - why not do one of those if modern is what one is after?CluelessandBride and Prejudicewere certainly fresh, modern retellings of Austen's work, and I loved both of them, but I don't see how those adjectives apply to this film.  I don't understand why filmmakers use material for which they obviously have little sympathy.  Something by the Brontes would probably have been more compatible.There were some things that I thought were well done.  I am not an expert, but I believe that, in this era when most clothes were custom made and relatively expensive, it was common for older people to wear the fashions of their youth, so I actually found that an interesting part of the representation.  I understand that this is supposed to be 1800, or earlier, and the typical Regency dress was originally considered to be quite shocking. As to the status of the Bennets, on the one hand, the greater sophistication of Caroline Bingley's clothing (except for that anachronistic slip dress) vice the clothing of the Bennets' and their neighbors is a realistic representation of the difference in their lifestyles.  The Bingley's are wealthier and spend more time in London; the Bennets probably rely on local seamstresses, and are just a touch behind in fashion.  Some of the Bennets' clothing was a bit grubby, but perhaps that was how country people dressed for solitary walks.  The moviemakers do seem to be a little confused as to what qualified as suitable dress for public appearances.  One can imagine that the difference in decoration at Longbourne and Netherfield partly represents the difference between landed gentry with generations of occupancy and heirlooms that no-one wants to throw out, and the nouveau riche who, starting from scratch, use the very latest fashion.  Everything about the Bennets and their neighbors ought to seem a trifle rustic and old-fashioned, just not lower class.On the other hand, the Bennets have a very good income for a ""gentleman"", and I sincerely doubt that the barnyard was up against the house or that the Bennets spent much time tending the livestock.  There's not much point to having pigs (which are notoriously smelly) right by the house unless one is personally slopping the hogs, and the Bennets had farmworkers.  I suppose that the filmmakers used this to indicate the precarious position of the sisters rather than explaining that in addition to the entail, their parents were too irresponsible to save money out of their income for dowries.  Earthier is not necessarily more realistic.Given the amount of material that had to be omitted, I cannot imagine why we spent so much time gazing at bushes.  If I were editting the movie, the scene of Lizzie walking across the field to the house would be the first to go.  It's cliched, a waste of time, and I've seen much better photography of the English landscape.So, I recommend this to lovers of costume drama who can keep the original novel out of their heads, or people who have never read the novel in the first place.On the entry for the movie showtimes, there is a review: ""A Tender, Beautifully-Filmed Prequel to ""The Clampetts""', January 1, 2006, by Carol M.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AM4L3WCU3A5EE	Elizabeth	One of the greatest love stories of all time.  I love the book.  I love the BBC version with Colin Firth, and I absolutely love this version!!!  The cast is amazing.  While the BBC version goes more in depth and stays a bit truer to the book this version keeps the feel of the book without some of the detail.The biggest thing that this version has going for it is the cast.  Mrs. Bennet is not nearly as annoying here - she's actually a bit endearing.  Jane Bennett is actually prettier than Elizabeth which is nice given that it is one of the key points of the plot.  The chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is AMAZING!!!  And I really like Mr. Collins...okay I don't like him, but I like his performance.The plot moves rather quickly and I have watched this dvd maybe 80 times in the past two years.  I love it!!!	5.0	Excellent and Entertaining	2011-04-03	3	2	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A12MD9H2O3QWKV	Elizabeth	"I have seen many versions or shall we say productions of Pride and Prejudice and this adaptation is far off the mark IMHO. Jane Austen never depicted her characters in such a low class style. The characters are seductive and appear cheap and even whorish. If this Mr Bennett is a ""gentleman"" than Lady Catherine is right to consider him not one. Colin Firth depicts Mr Darcy as arrogantly prideful and in this version Mr Darcy seems angry and rather sad all the time. I do not think that this adaptation truly developed the characters as the BBC adaptation did so elegantly. You barely knew the characters at all and most of them truly had no depth. I really disliked Mrs Bennett in the BBC version but in this one she was somewhat likable. Mr Collins was barely able to be despised. Overall I think it it a poor excuse for a work so fine as Jane Austen wrote.ElizabethTrinity, AL"	3.0	P&P Review	2012-10-21	5	2	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1I4B44UNBTVXT	Elizabeth, not Bennett	"I awaited the Nov. release of this film with impatience, after hearing about it in Bath, England last fall. I am a huge fan of Jane Austen. After viewing the film at the theatre, I was mystified - was this the same story? It seemed to venture very far from the book, which is my favorite and re-read many times. So when I saw it was coming out on DVD, I took it home and watched it again, with the same result.It wasn't until I turned on the Directors comments and heard his thoughts on the film that I understood what had happened. He obviously was looking at the story from his young, male point-of-view. In his comments I saw him repeatedly misunderstand the points of the story.I think the first issue I have with the film is it's lack of elegance. I have nothing against farms, but this was an Estate with a farm in the book. It set an uncomfortable tone for the Bennetts and made them much less genteel. How could young ladies with this up-bringing even get the attention of ""Gentlemen"", much less marry them? (As looked at from Jane Austen's time.)However, I must say that as a film without the historical context in mind, I thought the actors were very good and captured their characters superbly. The filming was excellent, with wonderful scenery and moody scenes with dark colors. And after that misty morning scene of Elizabeth and Darcy, I give kudos to the Director as well!Would I recommend it? YES!"	4.0	Rather disappointed	2006-03-15	15	8	7

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AGZEF6W4ASE49	Eliza Green	**** 3.5 Stars ****How to begin?I bought this movie because I truly enjoyed the novel, and then had the opportunity to purchase the BBC Production, which was beautifully told, and I thought, I have to see how they handle this in a very short (comparatively speaking) 2+ hour movie....As I watched the movie, I began to contemplate it in comparison with the great piece of literature that it is based upon, and found many discrepancies, and liberties taken....  And as I progressed through the movie, I had to keep reminding myself that it is not the retelling from the book, but rather an adaptation.However, even with that in mind, there were things I had a hard time looking past - most importantly, almost every characater, with the possible exception of Elizabeth and Darcy, were caricatures of their literary selves, everything they said and did appeared so (at times) over the top....As others have mentioned, there was definitely a more modern approach to propriety (i.e. Bingley entering the sick room, Lizzy and Darcy speaking in the morning hours in their bedclothes, Lady Catherine's night time visit, the various members of the Bennet family constantly eavesdropping whenever they can in such an uncircumspect manner, characters addressing each other by their Christian names, sleeveless dresses, etc.)With the costuming, and some of the locations, there were times where I felt like I was in Colonial America and not Regency England, and the actors definitely appeared less genteel than they were intended to appear in the book....The movie can be at times very melodramatic (think of the carriage ride back to Longbourn with Aunt and Uncle Gardiner and how dark and depressing it is outside - amazing how it suits her feelings... but is it really necessary?). And, can ANYBODY tell me what was up with that tree that Lizzy, her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner stopped at to rest while the carriage was being worked on prior to going to Pemberly?Having thus laid out some of my obstacles with this movie, I have to say that as an ADAPTATION from the novel, it does have its own merit...  The acting is great for the way the screenplay was written, and some of the creative things that were done, like the scene of Bingley interacting with Darcy to 'rehearse' his proposal to Jane, were fun to watch, even if it didn't 'agree' with the book.I encourage all to watch this with the full knowledge that it is MERELY AN ADAPTATION of the novel, not a retelling.... It is much easier to appreciate this as its own story, separate from the book and the BBC production of 1995.  Indeed, once I got past trying to compare it with either the book or the aforementioned BBC production, it was fun and enjoyable to watch!	3.0	Adaptation is the Key word	2006-03-04	10	6	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A28UFJF5K9DESN	"Elle ""Film Fan"""	I love Matthew Mcfadyen's work, all of it, and I think that Keira Knightly is a fabulous actress thus I was prepared to rank this version of Pride and Prejudice with the outstanding and pitch perfect Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thomas.I was sorely let down.  I did not like 1995's version of Pride and Prejudice with Ehle and Firth because I felt it too shrill, and after a while Ehle's exaggerated facial expressions became annoying. I felt that the actors whom she was laughing at or thinking about had to be in a coma not to notice them.Having said that I watched this version twice and still I could not get past the lack of chemistry between the two leads, and the camera movements which were dizzying.  The first dance sequence, the swing sequence in the farm yard, the soldiers marching through town, I felt that something was always moving in front of the actors obscuring them, and that the eye was constantly trying to find them in the picture.When Tom Hollander showed up at the front door here was yet another scene where half an actor's face was cut off until he moves to the left.  A camera angle stolen right from Polanski's Rosemary's Baby.  Finally I felt it all too forced - especially the endless giggling and laughter.I did love Dame Judy Dench who was severe and the cinematography and locations were outstanding which makes this purchase worth while at the current price.  The Blu Ray picture is beautiful.  The Blacks are rich and showing good detail even in Dench's dark estate.  The special features about the homes and locations are very intersting.	3.0	I Wanted To Like It	2011-10-06	1	0	1

If I hadn't known the story so well, I wouldn't have known what was going on half the time.  There was almost no character development, and all the wonderful wit and dry humor was either left out or played completely deadpan, as if either the director or the actors didn't understand what was being said.Don't waste your time with this one -- get the BBC or PBS versions instead.

Matthew MacFadyen is very hot!! I could just feel and see the passion he had for Lizzie.  The scene when it was raining and Mr. Darcy was expressing his love and Elizabeth was rejecting him.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ART923GFLL9LN	E. Loker	"This movie shows little comprehension of the book, the time, or the author.The director thought he could be edgy by making everyone seem dirty. Since Rob Roy and Braveheart, directors think they can make movies seem more historically accurate by showing filthy living conditions. This is Jane Austen. She writes about landed gentry in 19th century England, the motherland of domestic comfort, baths, and little scented soaps. The ""people that don't live in the modern western world are dirty"" concept is trite, inaccurate, and overdone.Major alterations are made to Austen's original characters.-Mary is given some of Elizabeth's lines, putting a spotlight on her character that was never intended.-The marital problems between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are glossed over. There is even a scene where they chat in bed. That they are a horrible match is very important to Elizabeth's ideas of matrimony.- Mr. Bennet is shown as an all around good father who shows no preference to Elizabeth. He even hugs Mary after her embarassing piano performance.There are plenty of other problems. It is a pretty film, but in the way that a Bronte movie should be filmed, dark and gothic. Keira Knightly's portrayal of Elizabeth contains way too much Keira Knightly, Lydia is badly done, Mrs. Bennet is underdone, Mr. Darcy is awful. The best casting is Jane's character and Caroline Bingley.In conclusion, if you like the book, don't watch this. Spend the extra time with the 1995 BBC version."	1.0	Shows no Respect to Jane Austen	2006-02-08	55	24	31
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2ZLF1PT9D0RZ4	ema_mom	Finally watched it after all these years. I loved the BBC version. Colin Firth was spectacular, but Matthew MacFadyen brought a whole new side to Mr. Darcy. Firth was every bit the Master - noble, aristocratic, confident & snooty. MacFadyen was awkward and shy. If a new version of P&P; came along, I would love to see Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy mixed with a heavy dose of MacFayden (except for the coiffure......he was worth ten thousand a year and yet he could not afford some hair gel and a comb). MacFadyen showed Mr. Darcy's struggling emotions better (and he looked good in a beaver hat and on a horse).The 2005 version strayed from canon, but it brought in some great romantic scenes: the double-take at the assembly; the sideways glance; the hand touch; the wild horse ride; the second proposal.KK was striking in the part, but BBC's more mature Lizzy was a better fit. Much of the character development was left on the cutting room floor due to time constraints, which made Lizzy's first rejection seem puzzling. How did she work up so much animosity toward Darcy? In the BBC version, there was no question why Lizzy was in a lather by the time he proposed.Overall, it was a good adaptation. I have not moved from Team Firth to Team MacFadyen-yet, but I my loyalty is wavering!	4.0	I'm Torn....Team Firth or Team MacFadyen???	2014-04-04	0	0	0

The actors are superb and wholly alive within this screen adaption of an Austen favorite; of course, some changes were made from her book to the big screen ,they are rather slight and personally acceptable to disgard--only the scene in which Elizabeth takes to walking the park when visiting Charlotte and happens upon Darcy really should have stayed in the movie since its a huge clue to how Darcy as well as Elizabeth truly feel for each other and are attempting to show to one another, without this scene the movie remains ambiguous if you don't pay really close attention to every subtle look, gesture and tone the characters exhibit.  Besides that though it remains an excellent story to lose oneself in.	5.0	Who doesn't love this movie?!	2007-04-03	5	3	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1655SGPPUUCRP	Emily Todd	"Over the years Hollywood has produced innumerable romantic comedies in which two people, obviously attracted to (and perfect for) one another, are kept apart by circumstances for a couple of hours until the artificial barriers between them are torn down and they wind up in each other's arms. Most of them have been terrible, but British director Joe Wright's new version of the Jane Austen tale which is the granddaddy of them all proves that if you only return to the source, and treat it if not with absolute fidelity at least with respect, the experience can be delightful. This is a lively, colorful, intelligent retelling of the template for all the later books and movies about two people obviously destined to be together who remain apart all too long due to misunderstandings and the machinations of others. Its sensibility is more modern than Austen's, of course, but that doesn't mean it's any less enjoyable on its own.At just a bit over two hours, this ""Pride and Prejudice"" can't include as much of the detail of Austen's original as the well-regarded five-hour BBC mini-series of 1995, which starred Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. But in Deborah Moggach's skillful adaptation it contains enough to convey the flavor of the book, as well as the basic plot, very successfully, though the tone is more overtly romantic; in this respect it's certainly the equal of the famous 1940 film with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. And Wright proves remarkably adept at infusing the action not only with the serenity and charm it needs, but with lightness and vivacity as well, an effect achieved especially by his penchant for fast-moving tracking shots, beautifully managed by cinematographer Roman Osin. Osin's luscious widescreen images have the benefit of focusing on lovely locations and utterly convincing period accouterments; the production design by Sarah Greenwood, art direction by Ian Baille, Mark Swain and Nick Gottschalk, set decoration by Katie Spencer and costumes by Jacqueline Durran are all superb. One could spend one's time just luxuriating in the visual splendor on the screen, made even happier by Dario Marianelli's pleasantly evocative score.But the meat of the story is in the characters, of course, and here too the film proves outstanding. Keira Knightley makes ample amends for her dreadful performance in ""Domino"" by portraying the strong-willed, level-headed Elizabeth Bennet as a young woman of both (dare one say it) spunk and an undercurrent of melancholy. Matthew Macfadyen, happily not a conventionally handsome sort, matches her by capturing Darcy's aristocratic demeanor and his inner conflict nicely. Together they make a couple that emphasizes the youthfulness and relative inexperience of Austen's creations far more than was the case in any of the previous filmizations--which makes the tale not only more credible but somehow more poignant. Their excellence doesn't stand alone; the supporting cast is superb, too, with Donald Sutherland wonderfully unruffled and sardonic as the put-upon Mr. Bennet and Brenda Blethyn keeping his wife--an unsophisticated woman obsessed with finding husbands for her many daughters, and a character that can easily become an irritation--within bounds. Rosamund Pike and Simon Woods make an appealing pair as the secondary couple in the mix, Elizabeth's easily-hurt elder sister Jane and Darcy's more ebullient friend Bingley, and Jena Malone is suitably flighty as the immature Lydia, whose infatuation with the handsome but unreliable Wickham (an appropriately smooth Rupert Friend) causes not only a Bennet family crisis but an opportunity that in time will lead to the resolution of the Elizabeth-Darcy impasse. If one can raise any qualifications about the casting, they'd have to concern Tom Hollander, who gives the stiff, obsequious Collins more of a conventionally comic tone than some might wish, and Judi Dench, whose Lady de Bourgh might seem too much the usual intrusive cameo (and whose final scene isn't ideally staged). But you easily become acclimated to them, and in the end they fit Wright's conception.In fact, when looked at as a whole, there's something just a bit miraculous about how enjoyable Wright's film is. ""Pride and Prejudice"" may be the same old story about finding Mr. Right, but this movie shows that if your take on the familiar tale is sufficiently deft, it can be as fresh and enchanting as Austen's book itself must have been in 1813."	5.0	"""Sometimes the last person on earth you want to be with is the one person you can't be without."""	2006-03-21	21	13	8

Extremely easy to follow and it isn't filled with things that shouldn't be there. It is perfectly shot.It is the only version of Pride & Prejudice I like enough to where I don't have to fast forward through parts I don't like. I like it in its entirety and while Keira Knightley was, MAYBE, miscast, I adored Rosamund Pike (Jane). Maybe she would have made a better Elizabeth. I don't know.I also liked Matthew Macfadyen in the role of Mr. Darcy. Of course, I know him better from MI-5, but I was able to put that role aside. He played Mr. Darcy very well.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2407EKRWQV10O	"EmptySpaceWatcher ""closetbookworm"""	I watched it when it came out in theaters and I just had to own the DVD. This version is perfectly cast. Keira(Lizzie), in this film, is not so drop dead gorgeous that nobody can see themselves in her (she's flat chested for one). And Matthew as Darcy is smolderingly hot. They captured the subtlety and nuances that a lot of romantic movies now no longer have and yet the same subtlety is what grips you, just like the book. The chemistry played in the film reminded me of first love (or infatuation) or an illicit affair.A lot of friends(fans of the book) hesitated watching the film as they didn't want the film character to ruin the image of Mr. Darcy they had in their heads. Ladies, Mcfadyen doesn't disappoint. He enhances it.He is still Darcy, yet hot hot hot. He made Darcy smolder. His acting is superb. Stiff upper lip but his eyes spoke volumes. Soulful, even. It smoldered, looked away, and light up with happiness that he couldn't help. And there were times that he looked like he was visibly swallowing eventhough you couldn't see it as his throat was covered with a cravat. And he managed to convey that he was aware of everything eventhough he wasn't even looking. Doesn't that sound like us, when we're holding ourselves back?And Keira as Lizzie, was wonderfully refreshing. Even people who haven't read the book could tell that she couldn't help herself, she was attracted to Darcy. Love could be mistaken for loathing. Throughout the film, she never said she liked him, except towards the end, yet both actors managed to play the characters as being extremely aware of each other. Isn't that how we feel, when the person we are so passionately attracted to walks into the room, we know it even without looking? That's how the film is. Perfect.The supporting cast was equally superb. Dame Dench, as Lady Catherine, can swallow you whole. Jenna was absurd and annoying (as she should be), I fast-forward her.The scenery is breathtaking. And there's always something going on in all corners of the screen, most notably, the ball scenes and the maid singing as she walked through the house.Overall, this film is delightful. Pemberly took my breath away as it did Keira Knightly. And Mcfadyen as Darcy, soaking wet and hurt? Wow. And check out the scene as he was coming out with the dawn of the sun behind him...morning dew, long coat and open shirt...wow wow. I'm in love again.	5.0	SMOLDERING DARCY SIZZLES..	2007-08-22	14	11	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A178OWW3HD7UYN	E. Niebel	Pride & Prejudice: Two MoviesJane Austen's novel, Pride & Prejudice, is set in rural, early nineteenth century England. It centers around Elizabeth Bennet, fun-loving and analytical, the second daughter of five. Though her family lives in what today seems a mansion, and her father is a gentleman, they are considered poor in the society in which they live. Mrs. Bennet thinks of little else than having her daughters married to the finest and richest men that she contrives to know of and meet. When two such men (jovial and friendly Mr. Bingly, and distant and proud Mr. Darcy) enter the community, the Bennet household is sent into an uproar of chatter and anticipation. Pride and prejudice on both sides, however, threaten to spoil the blossoming prospects.One adaptation of the classic was made in 1995, by A&E; and the BBC, with Colin Firth (as Mr. Darcy) and Jennifer Ehle (as Elizabeth Bennet). In this version, the photography is on a grand scale, with picturesque scenery. Many of the lines leap from the pages of the book, the story and it's messages are accurately depicted, and the acting is superb. Also not to be forgotten, is the beautiful, sometimes lively, sometimes serene, musical score, which sweeps the viewer into its mood.Taking a more modern approach, the 2005 adaptation (the one on this page) casts Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy, and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet. It also stars Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourg, aunt of Mr. Darcy. The photographic angles in this version were contemporary, as opposed to the traditional drawing room style of the BBC. This version takes much more liberty with the customs and propriety of the times (i.e. characters walking miles through the countryside in their nightclothes, or bursting into rooms with no announcement). All of the actors had big shoes to fill, but Knightly, Macfadyen, and Dench did a good job at casting new, and well-executed light on their characters (where the script allowed for it). Most of the other actors/characters, however, I don't think filled those shoes hardly at all. The costumes, music, and sets in this were all much shabbier than those in the 1995 version. I think this script would be difficult for a newcomer to the story to follow, especially regarding introduction of characters. Also, in trying to make the script different from other versions, the characters simply changed their minds, instead of growing and learning throughout the narrative, and the lessons of the story were lost for the most part.All this said, I prefer the 1995 adaptation, because: it adheres to the story and times; the music, landscape, and costumes are elegant; the acting (in my opinion) is superior.Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)	3.0	A Question of Superiority	2009-10-15	3	1	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1SBWSE9HRZLC	epratte	I was extremely disappointed when I got this movie because the packaging was different than I was expecting. In the reviews a customer wrote that the cover was made to look like a book and that there was a booklet inside with pictures and that it came with the soundtrack. After ordering this movie and expecting it to look the way the customer described it, I was really disappointed. After I got the movie I went on Amazon to see if I got the wrong one, but apparently the customer was reviewing a different collectors edition. I only wish that the review would be showing for that specific item that they actually purchased, whether it be like the one the customer described or the one that I bought and it wasn't the one the review was written about. I still absolutely love this movie and I will watch it over and over. But if you're like me and are expecting it to look like a book and come with a booklet inside and the soundtrack, then you will be disappointed.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A17R50L4E730YH	"Eric Escamilla ""Esco"""	How would the teens of Dawson's Creek or the recent Juno speak like if they were English in the year 1797?  Look no further than Pride and Prejudice, one of the greatest love stories ever told and the original template for essentially every modern chick-flick or romantic comedy to come henceforth.At first I thought the movie was rather talky and somewhat boring, but the more i watched and the more I paid attention, I started to realize that this is one of the most engaging and accurately lavish English period pieces I have ever seen before.But it is not for everyone.  Certainly notsomuch as Atonement is for more general audiences or more easily digestible.  This film requires a more expert level of movie watching/comprehension and a certain degree of literary aptitude.  It begs for, nay demands the viewers active participation, involvement, and a certain commitment of attention more novice pieces would dare not request.  And by literary aptitude I don't necessarily mean the source novel as much as I mean Shakespeare.  The characters relate and converse in a pseudo-Shakespearean manner minus the iambic pentameter.  If you cannot keep up with all of the double entendras, doublespeak, subliminal messages and the like you will likely have a difficult time appreciating the genius of this screenplay written by Deborah Moggach.The complicated relationships and plot are also like a Shakespearan comedy (all though at times feels like a tragedy) and it is very easy to get left behind if you are not of to task.  This is why I enjoyed the movie so much.  You need to pay full attention to fully appreciate this work of art.  Visually there were many hidden cues like actors' not-always-so-obvious facial expressions as well as unspoken hints from the brilliant, however also purposeful wardrobe and costume design.  It's very difficult to explain in a simple way, but I simply love this director's work; Joe Wright is stupid genius!What a guilty pleasure for a moviephille for me to watch.And let us not even mention the name Keira Knightley.  This is the film that finally put her on the map as a serious actress to be reckoned with and not just another pretty face.  She thoroughly shines throughout as the star and primary protagonist of the movie.Director Joe Wright's second motion picture 'Atonement' was extrmely good, a modern classic in its own right, but it was not exactly a happy story.  It did not make me smile inside as the subtle and not-so-subtle humor like P&P; did.  This one was more a romp that leaves one giddy so giddyup!note:  This was my first treatment of P&P.;  I never saw any other version or read the book, but now I have decided to gobble up all of Jane Austen's other famous works and find myself feverishly awaiting Joe Wright's forthcoming film 'The Soloist'My Addendum:I have been perusing the 1 star reviews that are speckeled among the many praising and applauding reviews of this movie and I just wanted to say something to address those naysayers.  First of all, I think you all have lost much prospective and are waging your 1 star rating for hyperbolic effect.  And second, if all of you who loathed this adaptation were in charge of all other adaptations in Hollywood, movies would just plain suck and not really be viable or marketable at all.  Thank goodness this is not the state of things.  It is more palatable movies such as this that satisfy the masses that draw in new viewers to your precious A&E;/BBC version or bring in new readers to the original novel.  Is that such a horrible thing?  I swear so many rabid Austen fans think P&P; was written only for them and belongs to them and if it isn't the approved 1995 edition of the miniseries, well then thee be damned.  Chill out already and stop trying to ruin it for the rest of us.  You should all be thanking the director Joe Wright because thanks to him (eventually) more people in the world will get to know who the heck Colin Firth even is!	5.0	Wordgasms ensue	2008-05-24	5	3	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2SRZQU1SZG4RR	"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower"""	"Superb casting, outstanding scenery, well designed period settings and a brilliantly written novel by Jane Austen comes to life making this a block buster winner and one of the hottest films this season. The film is likely to garner several well deserved Academy Awards ... I love the realistic country scenes and the opulent wealth of the era as depicted in this film. Keira Knightly is charming and dazzling as the intelligent and articulate Lizzie who is transformed within this film, becoming the butterfly that arises from her unique chrysallis. Matthew MacFadyen is the perfect Mr. Darcy, a darkly handsome introspective, intelligent gentleman ... who is easily misunderstood.Keira Knightly is an outstandng Elizabeth (Lizzie) Bennett, with her well chiseled lovely porcelain facial features, beautiful large brown expressive eyes, lovely swan-like neck and gorgeous brown hair, often worn pulled up and back, with tendrils framing her face. Her clever articulate observations and quips are very memorable throughout the film as she challenges the quietly brooding and handsome Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen). One memorable scene is when the guests of honor, Mr. Bingley, his sister and Mr. Darcy arrive in the ballroom, the dancing and music stop as the people part to each side, like a zipper being unzipped. Mr. Bingley happily joins in the dancing and socializing but both Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy remain aloof, quietly commenting on the differences between living in the city and country. It is quite obvious they feel  superior compared to the locals. Mr. Bingley laughs and smiles as he dances with Miss Jane Bennett (Rosamund Pike). Her mother, Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blethyn,) is delighted by this good fortune. She is actively seeking a husband for Jane who is of marriagable age and the eldest daughter of five.During an intermission Lizzie over hears Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy discussing Jane and herself. Mr Darcy describes Lizzie as ""tolerable"" but essentially not his type. This phrase will eventually come to haunt him, as Lizzie repeats it to him  later during an encounter. Based on this event, she develops preconceived notions about Mr. Darcy's character and manners. She makes no secret of her feelings about him to her family.Jane pays a social visit to the Bingley's country mansion and becomes ill, requiring her to stay as an overnight guest for several days until she recovers. Mr. Bingley can not hide his joy at having such a pretty and desirable house guest. Lizzie visits her sister during the illness and encounters Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley. She engages Mr. Darcy in several verbal duels and cleverly exchanges challenging words, demonstrating superior skill and prowess in the intellectual game of quoting poetry and verse. Both Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen perfom their roles superbly ...While Mr. Bingley was falling in love with Jane and quietly making his feelings known, his sister suddenly closed the manor house and persuaded him and her entourage to return to London. It is obvious she wanted to sever the budding relationship between her brother and Jane, before it became serious. Essentially, Miss Jane Bennett was viewed as a social inferior. About this time, the Reverend Mr. Collins came calling on the Bennetts, with the intention of marrying one of the daughters. He lived on an estate owned by Lady Catherine, who required him to find a wife before she would finance a parsonage and church for him. Lizzie captured his attention but she outright rejected his proposal. Following this refusal, Mr. Collins offered marriage to Charlotte their young housekeeper, who accepted him. Lizzie could not understand why Charlotte would marry Mr. Collins until the realities of Charlotte's situation sunk in. Charlotte explained he had a stable profession and provided her a home which was a major improvement from her current situation. Lizzie slowly awakened into adulthood, recognizing many unpleasant facts of life. The scenes went from comedy to almost tragedy as different events unfolded in the lives of the Bennett family. The importance of social position and wealth in selecting a life partner was clear and evident.It never dawned on the Bennett's that the sudden departure of the Bingley's was meant as a snub, a refusal of Miss Jane Bennett as a fiance. The Bennetts had high hopes of relighting the match and sent Jane to visit an Aunt in London in hopes of meeting Mr. Bingley. About this time, Lizzie was visiting Brighton with her relatives when she took a tour of Mr. Darcy's residence which was open for public viewing. She met him unexpectedly in the garden and received a declaration of love which took her completely by surprise. She immediately dismissed it and rejected him ...Jane returned from London without having established any social connection with Mr. Bingley. Lizzie returned from Brighton, in an unusual emotional state, a totally confused frame of mind. Unknown to herself, she was battling unresolved feelings for Mr. Darcy. A family crisis arose when Lydia, the middle daughter, had run away with a soldier. This scandal would ruin the Bennett's chances for marrying off Jane and Lizzie to good families. Help came from an unexpected source: Mr. Darcy had known this soldier in the past. Mr. Darcy's father had treated the soldier nearly like a son. Due to nearly similar circumstances involving Mr. Darcy's sister Georgiana, he rescued Lydia from her shameful situation by setting them up finanacially and ensuring Lydia married her soldier. When Lizzie heard of this matter, she remained in a deep quagmire for having rejected his overtures of love, she was awakening to the true nature of his character and discovered herself attracted to him. The resolution to Lizzie's emotional conflict and the rematch between Jane and Mr. Bingley is what makes the book and this film so popular. Jane Austen's classical writing via this new film adaptation provides a creative twist to the eternal conundrum which young ladies and young gentlemen of every era and generation must face and resolve anew for themselves.Erika Borsos (erikab93)"	5.0	Jane Austen's Classical Yin/Yang Conundrum	2005-11-28	19	12	7

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A15YB7OGCFD441	Esperanzahope	"First off, I am a huge Jane Austen fan. I love this story but I didn't love this movie. If you haven't seen this movie, let me just warn you that this film strays from the book a lot. For instance...Darcy's aunt comes storming into the Lizzy's home in the middle of the night. Or the fact that Elizabeth runs outside in her nightgown...and who does she happen to come across but Mr. Darcy! And the ending? That was creative license if ever I saw it.This actually leads me to the reason why I really didn't like this film. Everything was so rushed and obvious. When you watch the film, you'll notice there's a scene when Darcy helps her into a carriage and then they get a close up on his hand clenching. Then there are scenes when they look at eachother longingly. There was no mention of him beginning to like her ""fine eyes"" The way the film depicts the romance between the two wasn't special. I always loved the book because of the differences the two must overcome to finally see eachother as their ultimate love. To me it seemed like the screenwriter knew the audience would want the two characters to end up together so they didn't put in all the details that make the story special.If you liked the A&E; version, you may not appreciate this adaption because they really do change things up. Scenes happen in different locations, a little dialogue has been added, the characters are depicted as really poor and shabby which in my opinion kind of took away from the magic of the story. Needless to say I wasn't happy with this version. The only thing I DID like about this film was when he finally asks her to marry him, her response was I imagined it to be because it was romantic (unlike the A&E; version where they just keep on taking their walk together).P.S. If you do decide to buy this dvd make sure you get the widescreen. I viewed the fullscreen and there were several scenes where the characters were so far away from eachother that you would hear them talking but could only see the blue sky between them on the tv."	1.0	This would have been GREAT...If I hadn't read the book :(	2006-03-09	49	32	17

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2J6TTYPDWOXZA	E. T. Sprenkle	"I went with a crowd to see this movie, in part because the other theatres were sold out. I had heard several negative comments, mostly by my British friends, and wasn't keen on seeing it.Overall, it was an enjoyable movie, but not a classic, and certainly nothing on the scale of the 1995 BBC series which I was forced to watch once or twice (it is very long).People are correct when they say that the 2005 version failed to capture the essence of Jane Austen's society. The British, living closer to history than the Americans do, were justifiable in their lukewarm reaction. Too much 21st century sensibilities were injected into 1810 or whatever the year of the story, and if you are a history buff, as I am, it can be annoying to see modern thoughts and behavior presented with regency costumes. The behavior of the Bennet family and the society at the ball in the movie would have mortified the original characters in Jane Austen's day. The ball scene, with people behaving more like country bumpkins and farmers rather than the class conscious, manners obsessive, landed gentry they actually were, was unrealistic. And even an impoverished family of any pretensions (as the Bennets were portrayed to us in this version) would not have had pigs running around just outside the back door, let alone walking through the front hall of the house. It was also a bit unfair to portray Mrs. Bennet as a boorish drunkard.As it stands, a major reason many people love Austen's work is the portrayal of a society and its mores that have long since disappeared, a society where everything one said or did was carefully examined, analyzed, and criticized by its members, and the obsession with ""gentle"" values and ""gentle"" behavior was paramount. The 1995 BBC version very much caught the essence of that society along with the portrayal of the love story, which is why it has become a classic. Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility also does an excellent job in capturing the feel of the period.Still, ignoring the flaws and the director's failure to capture the essence of 18th/19th century society, the movie was a fun watch. Not remarkable, and certainly not a classic, but enjoyable. The 1995 BBC version, for very good reasons, will be the one to last the ages and be watched by people fifty years down the road, long after Keira Knightly has been forgotten."	3.0	Ok movie, enjoyable but not faithful	2006-02-09	13	7	6

Because of that, I put off for a very long time until just recently watching this version. First, I did not think the actors could possibly measure up and second, it is an abridged version, so a great deal of the story would inevitably be sacrificed. I had also heard about the infamous kiss at the end of this version.I am happy to report that I enjoyed this film for its own sake. Relatively short though it is, Macfadyen and Knightley offer a lovely take on the romance. They are both very attractive people who are young enough to be very near the actual ages of the characters, and their chemistry is wonderful. Macfadyen especially does a wonderful job with soulful, smouldering looks that suit Darcy perfectly.I highly recommend this wonderful version of P&P; to all Austen fans.	5.0	It's not Colin Firth, but I loved it anyway	2011-06-28	1	1	0

I've also read many reviews by Austen fans as well and I agree that this version leaves a lot out of the book and you wish there was more.  However, people must remember that the 2005 version of P&P is like any other version 'an adaptation' and can't possibly be an exact replica.  This movie in itself is great.  If you want more than what this 2-hour version had to give you must read the book or check out another version but don't discredit this version altogether.  If you had $30,000,000 and had to shrink a book into a two hour story, obviously you'd have to leave scenes and in some cases entire characters out just to get on with the story.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ABXQMLMTJJRDA	F. Bartholomew	Keira Knightley is perfect as Elizabeth Bennet. Then again, I don't ever recall seeing Keira Knightley in any movie where she didn't become the part and make it her own. Matthew Macfadyen was absolutely amazing. I really didn't think anyone could top Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, but somehow Matthew Macfadyen WAS Mr. Darcy, no doubt. Their chemistry was a perfect blend of annoyance and sparks, you were never quite sure what you would get. Rosamund Pike is perhaps one of the prettiest actors I can think of, and the most perfect Jane Bennet.Donald Sutherland & Brenda Blethyn were the perfect Mr. and Mrs Bennet. They too had a chemistry as husband and wife that was believable and loving.The best cast (IMHO) was Claudie Blakley as Charlotte Lucas. I think I liked her much better after seeing the movie. I have read the book a good maybe 25+ times (if not more) and seen the movies (both versions) many times.5 stars	5.0	Love this version!	2012-07-07	2	1	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A59TM6OC16NXM	FeathersMcGraw	"Although I do not consider myself a ""finnicky"" Austen purist, there is only so much irreverence I can take. If you want a good laugh - go see this. Although it's more likely you'll laugh AT it than with it. I realize they were extremely pressed for time, and in light of that I do give them some credit for what they tried to do. However.......My main quarrel is with Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy, who is wooden and awkward (and I don't compare him with Colin Firth - this is how he truly is without comparison)I read in a review that Mcfadyen did not read the book before they began shooting. What a mistake! Maybe if he had, he should have done more justice to the character and the movie.Secondly: Keira Knightly, who i'm afraid is just another pretty face. She cannot play Elizabeth, most of the movie she walks around with an artificial smile, and when in doubt, tries to play up Lizzy's vivacity by laughing, when nothing is really amusing. True, she was not so gratingly bad as Mr. Mcfadyen, but I think she too, missed the essence of the character.As for the rest of the Bennet clan, I think a former reviewer caught it very well: they are barnyard rustics living in a shabby house, where the daughters are seen baking - then later Mrs. bennet denies that her girls have anything to do in the kitchen! as for the other girls: Jane is lovely, but too shy. Lydia looks more like she should be playing Mary, and vice versa. Mr. Bennet is seen in the book as a sort of indolent country gentleman who is fond of books, in this version we see him taking an active role in the farm, and when he is in the house, trying vainly to be witty. Donald Sutherland was a bad choice.What is most disturbing to me though, is the closing scene, all fans of the book and the A&E; version will agree - this is weird, awkward, and completely uncalled for. What would Jane Austen think? I wonder."	2.0	Tell me - is this for real?	2005-11-23	27	15	12

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1CF83NQFCPNHU	femme tetu	"Keira Knightley is a revelation here.  Watch her closely as she responds to Mr. Darcy's question about encouraging affection... amazing!  Her youth and vivacity give us as passionate an Elizabeth as Jennifer Ehle's grace and intelligence did in 1995.  Meanwhile, Matthew MacFadyen is just so much more manly and plays a more layered Darcy than Colin Firth - proud, brooding, conflicted, honorable, but also awkwardly unglued in front of Elizabeth.  And he does it ever so subtly - just a twitch of his lips, a blink of his eyes.  With his rugged good looks, strong built, and that voice... there is no need for a wet shirt scene to make women and less manly men swoon!  (By the way, I shall never understand why some complain about the extra ending scene, when MacFadyen's bare calves are far more attractive than Firth's wet shirt.  I was too young in 1995, but did anyone complain about the lake scene then?  I rest my case.)I love the 1995 version, but only because of Ehle's performance.  As much as I think Firth is one of the best actors out there, his Darcy never did stir anything for me.  He seemed too cold, too detached, and (sorry) ""not handsome enough to tempt me"".  I just never pictured Darcy to look like him when I read the book. I didn't see any chemistry between the two  until much later in the story, when Elizabeth visits Pemberley.  Whereas, Knightley and MacFadyen's is electrifyingly oh-so-palpable from the first moment they lay eyes on each other!Throw in the wonderful supporting cast, beautiful locations, divine editing, and that battle scene in the rain... I'm in heaven!  Five starred, albeit one gripe:  As every P&P; fan shall agree, this blu-ray does NOT meet expectations in the EXTRA FEATURES department.  We don't get the original goodies from the original DVD release: no P&P; Diaries (although the Politics of Dating is interesting).  But worst, worst, worst of all is that the highly anticipated deleted scenes are not included!!!!!  Mr. Wright, we shan't mind watching extra shots of bonnets and carriages!  I'm hoping -- nay, praying -- that they will issue a special edition at some point.  Why, I promise to pay whatever their price... if only they add the deleted scenes that we know exist!Lacking extra features it may be, the movie is still worth the blu-ray viewing.  The picture quality is very very good.  Gone is the fuzzy focus of the DVD - you could actually see lint off Knightley's shoulder and the pup at Caroline Bingley's feet (missed that one on the DVD).  If you have the DVD, donate it to some worthy cause, and pick up the blu-ray.  Pop some corn and enjoy!"	5.0	Deleted scenes?	2010-09-07	7	6	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A19OQ7LWE2YJL3	"F.Faulkner ""F.F."""	Absolutely NO humor. I can't be Jane Austen without her wit. This film lacked any chemistry at all between the family and that is the foundation upon which an Austen novel is built. Lizzie & Jane barely spoke, the father (played by Sutherland) was dull and lackluster. Keira Knightly's hair was absolutely ugly with those always wet-looking bangs. It was a ghastly take on Pride & Prejudice. The scenery was gratuitous, there were contrived silences that only interrupted the cadence of the plot, and there was just nothing to write home about in this film.Keira Knightly's portrayel of Lizzie Bennet was too strong, that jutting chin and too-fighting glance was all wrong for the character. Lizzie has more grace, tact, class, and love for her family. YUCK!	1.0	Utterly horrid!	2006-05-20	48	31	17
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1WCQ282UKVWJ9	Fidget's Momma	"I read somewhere recently that the directors/producers of this version made some intentional decisions to do unnecessary things like lowering the financial status of the Bennets to near-poverty, changing some of the dialog to sound more modern and reflective of (their own shallow experience with) teenaged girls, and changing the timeframe entirely because the director ""didn't like"" the fashions of the time in which Austen set her original novel. They apparently wanted this version to appeal more to a younger audience. Thus, along with the issues mentioned above, you will also find faster cuts and dialog, scenes in which the characters do things that would be completely unacceptable for the time (Lizzie with her hair completely down, or Darcy walking across fields with his shirt flapping open), and some very strange behavior from the family (Jane allowing a man in her room while she is in her nightdress). Not to mention the blatant attempt to infer sexual innuendo where there simply isn't any. (Seriously? That shot of the pig's...um...boy parts? Lizzie making a very vulgar check of Wickham's rear? ...Was the director influenced by a 13 year old boy?)Knightly's portrayal bugged me more than a little. I couldn't figure out what she was giggling at half the time, and the other half, the character was doing things blatantly out of character for Austen's heroine. I did, however, appreciate the fact that Mrs. Bennet is slightly more lovable in this version. The 1995 portrayal grates on the ""nerves"" and is way over done, but I thought this actress did a much more appropriate job of it.It is worth a look every once in a while, but if you want to see an adaptation that actually attempts to remain true to the story and the customs of the day (and not our narcissistic modern teenaged audience) then I, too, would recommend the Ehle/Firth BBC production."	2.0	"Meant to be a ""teen"" movie, and it succeeds"	2013-01-12	3	3	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3RIW5WS6KMKWM	"Fiona   Anne ""Anne"""	My first impression  of Joe Wright's version was that it was barely tolerable...but decided it was probably worth a second viewing.Like Lizzie (aka Kiera K) how could I have been so blind?  The film is a masterpiece, blinded by my own prejudice of previous adaptations and the original novel. This version deserves, if not demands, a second viewing.  Keira Knightley is astounding.  Yes, she is more outwardly emotional than Austen's 18th century heroine and probably more beautiful from a 21st century perspective but  the essence of the youthful, wilful and independent Lizzie is just fantastic to watch. Oscar nomination rightly deserved -  Girl you was robbed!Joe Wright, the director, says he put his heart into this production, and OK I don't agree with all his casting decisions Donald S (mad professor with bad hairdo)and Tom Hollander, far too drippy,'sensitive'and to cap it all short which they play upon suggested by Hollander. In the book the odious Mr Collins is considered tall, well over 6ft and wonderfully pompous.  I like this so wish they hadn't changed him quite so much.However as a director, Joe Wright has created a truly beautiful, moving yet comic production.  The cinemaphotography and music further enhance the experience. For me this was only obvious on the second and subsequent viewings. It is a truly multi-layered production, as all good films should be and the opening dance scenes are so full of energy and life. Yes, there are discrepancies with the novel but you still want to be there!I know the Bennets look poverty-stricken but this helps re-inforce the differences in social standing between Lizzie and Darcy to a modern audience, in a way that the 1990 mini series and the 1980s more faithful versions can't convey.In the additional material I particularly love when the director says 'it's not about the most beautiful people in the room' because ironically it is! You can't get much more stunningly handsome couple as Keira Knightley and Mathew Macfadyen, but quite rightly so, because at the end of the day they can both act and 'the magnetism' is also there.The actors are all fantastic.  Brenda Blethyn superb, Rosamund Pike ethereal, Jenna Malone and Carey... silly and annoying but at 15 and 16/17? so they should be - great. Mary was far too beautiful but I give the director leave on this as our Mary gets such a raw deal usually. On the downside Bingley and the Gardiners were disappointing:When Lizzie says to Jane re Bingley,  'I give you leave to like him, you have liked far stupider a person.' I thought, Really? Is that possible!!! However, his gaucheness grows on you.The Gardiners are supposed to be the refined, elegant relations but here we get Penelope Wilton (who can look elegant) and her portly husband are continually munching pies! Can't find any redeeming features here...Not sure about the Titanicesque sequence on the cliffs as I always want to stand up and shout - LIZZIE DON'T DO IT!Inspite of these interpretations it's still a fantastic film with or without 2 endings.Overall I prefer the UK version ending (thank you Joe Wright and UK audiences) as it reflects the ending in the book and the author would have approved.At heart I am a true purist but it is fun to watch the syrupy yuky USA ending. Bare ankles, Divine Goddess!! My God - snogging! All that is missing in the USA ending was the dreaded wedding. I would like to think Jane would have approved but fear she would not. Will no doubt hopefully appeal to a younger generation though.  So, if that means more people will read and enjoy Jane Austen as much as I have over the years then what more can one ask for.	5.0	First  Impressions	2006-03-26	14	10	4

She has watched it on VHS many, many times, and knows almost every scene by heart. I looked forward to watching it with her on our home theater system consisting of a hi-def front projector displaying on a 96"" diagonal screen, and a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround system using a Denon receiver and Definitive Tech speakers (BP2002 towers, CLR2002 center, BP2X surrounds and PF15 sub). Anyway, the audio quality is outstanding, as was expected. The music is a highlight of this film and I enjoy it immensely. However, my wife commented that the top and bottom of the image was cut off. I told her that this widescreen image was simply wider and she was mistaken, but she insisted that she was right, so she popped in her VHS tape and we compared identical scenes, and surprisingly, she was right. In one scene, the father is sitting in a chair and you could see his hands folded in his lap. In the DVD version, you can not see his hands at all. A minor detail for sure, but my wife says that she likes her version better. Oh well, I'm hoping that the hi-def version scheduled to be released in November will have the entire picture without any cropping.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AUTHZ1104HV4K	f.m.	what i like about this P&P; adaptation is that even if it departs quite liberally from the book, any liberties taken fit into this particular assembly of cast & different perspective taken by the film makers. it is the P&P; story told with lots of emotion which makes it very real. though initially dismayed by the shabbiness of the bennet household, the rustic grittiness of longbourn & its occupants grew on me. all of the characters are familiar yet they took on added personalities that, though not faithful to the book, are nevertheless fascinating, hilarious, endearing & so genuine. i got so drawn into the film like i was a part of it.i never really visualized lizzy as fierce & as giggly as keira's lizzy is but somehow knightley's youthful vitality works in the movie's context. macfadyen gives a fresh dimension to darcy. his soulful eyes & deep timbre of voice are so effective in matthew's darcy who, beneath the sullen & aloof exterior, is shy, vulnerable & so unsettled by his instant attraction to lizzy. you absolutely get that sense in matthew's boyish & understated performance. it is not the mature, reserved, confident darcy from the book but macfadyen makes his darcy work (i expect to see more films from this brilliant `spooks/perfect strangers' actor). above all, macfadyen & knightley have a wicked chemistry, with a youthful passion that just seem to fit right into the overall thread of the movie.with the fireworks lurking beneath the two protagonists, the movie certainly did not disappoint in delivering a tickle-me-pink finale. the misty dawn `proposal' scene & even the ridiculously romantic `american' ending gave this version a wishfully fulfilling end. so outrageously melodramatic but again, it feels right in this rendition.i think it was wise for the film makers of this P&P; to take the story into a different direction. i loved all previous adaptations but it's refreshing to see how a fresh spin on an enduring novel can still delight & entertain. i just simply adore this film.	5.0	not pure austen ... but with dynamic young leads, great chemistry, gritty look	2006-03-10	6	5	1

I understand that to make this into a big screen picture, they had to take a much longer work and condense it into a 2 hour and change length movie.  Wow, did the story line fly.  And it was a shame that the characters weren't developed more, particularly Mr. Bennet.  They had Mr. Bennet mumbling through most of the movie. Mr. Darcy seemed sulky, not snobby.  I also think Keira Knightly really tried too hard on her accent (and she's English!).What happened to the Hursts?  What was up with the Bennet's house - did anyone else notice that it looked really run down and messy?  Did the set hairdresser quit? And the clothes - the styles seemed inconsistient.I admit, I have seen the A&E; version (and hold it as the standard).  If you want to see an adaptation of P&P; that is made my people who truly loved the book, rent the A&E; version.

The 1939 version, starring Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier, is still charming and holds that nostalgic class that practically all of the films of that period in time seem to hold.  However, Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfayden have taken this material to new heights.  I was glad for Reese Witherspoon's win at the Academy awards, for her portrayal of June Carter Cash  in ""Walk The Line,"" was very well done.  But after having seen Keira Knightley's performance here in this enduring tale, I couldn't believe such an injustice could have been done.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3VT5RE96FJLWG	"F. Raider ""MommaRaider"""	"I saw the new Pride & Prejudice last night, and just as I hoped it is soooooooooooo romantic! Somehow this movie also manages to be hilarious, but in an understated, un-American sort of way.Keira Knightly did an outstanding job of being her usual independent, outspoken, beautiful self in the part of Lizzy, she certainly re-defined the role from the A&E; version, a little less refined and more earthy.Matthew MacFayden did a fantastic job of minimizing Mr. Darcy's flaws to simply being shy. He hardly ever seems really pompous or prideful and is altogether quite adorable.Donald Southerland was Mr. Bennett and though I didn't like him quite as much as the father in the A&E; version he still did an outstanding job.One of the flaws in this movie is that everyone but Kiera Knightly is so plain! Even Jane (played by Rosamund Pike - isn't that a beautiful name?), who is my favorite character in the story, seemed like she was trying to look like the A&E; Jane. She was very sweet but also silly.The costumes are extremely well done, each character's wardrobe helps to further define his or her character - for instance moody Lizzy wears earth tones and sweet Jane wears pastels, Caroline Bingly wears fancy dresses made of rich looking material in much brighter colors and sleeker styles whereas the Bennetts wear simple dresses of rougher material.The cinematography is fantastic, there are several scenes that are just amazing, I'm thinking especially of the scenes after Lizzy has rejected Mr. Darcy, the mirror scene, the walking through the mist scene and the viewing the landscape scene. This movie was filmed at some wonderful locations and we are given a few moments here and there to enjoy it.Of course when turning a novel into a movie there has to be an enormous amount of editing, paring the book down into a manageable 2 hour long movie, so one or two characters have been cut out (I especially noticed Mr. Bingly's other sister & husband were missing) and others marginalized (Mr. Wickham's character especially) or under-developed (as in Mr. & Miss Bingly) but one would expect that. On the other hand there were some wonderful interpretations of scenes, especially during Mr. Darcy's proposals.There were also a couple of additional lines that were stuck in as sort of an explanation for modern viewers as to what's going on, like when Miss Lucas accepts Mr. Collins proposal or another time when Lizzy and Mrs. Bennett are together, talking about Lydia's upcoming marriage, Lizzy says ""Is that (marriage) all you think about?"" and Mrs. Bennett says to Lizzy ""Wait until you have five daughters."" It was quite comical.Thankfully, the movie remains pure and honorable. The flirts get themselves into awful trouble, the passive father receives his cupful of due shame, the aggressive silly mother, as silly as ever and never justified. The state of marriage is honored and physical affection between couples are, amazingly, kept sacred - they don't even kiss until after they are married! Marriage and family are honored, rather than belittled, and portrayed frankly but beautifully.On the whole, this movie is just lovely! My husnbad even watched it with me and enjoyed it. I am sure I will watch it over and over."	5.0	Love this one!!	2007-01-18	4	2	2

I thought this was appropriate of two people who did not care the actions but still had some feelings for one another. I do feel that the on screen chemistry was good.Did the movie take huge liberties with the book. Yes.I think the thing that most bothered me was when Elizabeth walked in with her hair down.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A28PYKCM4FUDIP	Frequent buyer	"This is, by far, the worst adaptation of a Jane Austen novel that I have ever seen.  The reason Jane Austen works are so beloved is that she gives her characters such depth and subtlety, all of which is lost in this incredibly shallow, hollywood-ized piece of garbage.  The characters were poorly cast and even more poorly developed by the actors playing them.  I have never hated a screen adaptation of any novel more than I despise this.  I have to believe that the people giving this 4 and 5 stars have either not read the novel, or just don't ""get it""."	1.0	A travesty	2009-01-17	19	10	9
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1QIOSF4F5MDWZ	"Fritz Whitaker ""Southern Movie Enthusiast"""	Having read the praises of some of the earlier reviewers, I had to add my two cents. This is the fourth version of the Jane Austen classic that I have seen and this one is the worst version. None of the actors were even competent in pulling off their roles, the screenplay was not at all faithful to Ms Austen's fine dialogue, the direction was lackluster and the art direction left a lot to be desired. Even the the 1940 version with its MGM/Hollywood treatment surpasses this atrocity. I was glad to have the thing over with in the end.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1FE02NALTS01Q	"frugal ""world traveler"""	I have read this classic Jane Austen story so many times. I have seen so many versions of this classic. But, when I saw this version, I was appalled. The interpretation was modernized and failed in its attempt to remake an adaptation; it proved to be disastrous. First, the setting for the Bennet home depicted them as extremely vulgar. Second, Darcy appeared weak and stupid. Third, the screenwriters completely changed the storyline thus it was not an adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, but a distasteful, unresearched film about a silly girl in a messed up fantasy world that did not depict the 1800's in our world and then a weak and confused, immature male that falls in love with her. It was disgusting.	2.0	destroyed the classic	2008-08-16	12	7	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3GA09FYFKL4EY	Fruit Loop	"Beautiful production values enhance the entertainment value of this latest adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel. The storyline itself will win over any moviegoer, even those who usually balk at period pieces and classic literature. The characters are likeable and the sets are exquisite.Elizabeth and her sisters, from an impoverished family, are even more eager to make the ""great marriage"" that all young laides of the time were expected to find. Elizabeth, however, just can't bring herself to marry a man she doesn't respect no matter how much it helps her needy family. She surprises herself when she finds love and fortune with the man she least likes.Fine performances as well as a great story make this movie one not to be missed for those unfamiliar with the novels, and fans of Ms. Austen won't be disappointed with this newest remake."	5.0	Lovely period piece	2006-12-23	6	2	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1OZFMJ2AD2R41	Furiae	"To think a story like Pride and Prejudice can be improved on, that one can write its dialogue better than Jane Austen, and that a story such as this needs help before it can become accessible is a case of hubris.  The appeal of Pride and Prejudice is universal and its characters are timeless.  The creators of this movie, however, took major liberties in their translation of this classic onto the big screen.I had high hopes for this movie, and I anxiously awaited for its release, but it fell completely short of my expectations.  Most of its characters were poorly cast, and the scriptwriters blundered many parts of the plot, re-writing it into nonsense that wouldn't have fit the sentiments and protocols of the era.Mr. Bingley was portrayed like a goofy boy rather than a respectable, good natured gentleman; Caroline Bingley looked more like a runway model on a perpetual high as opposed to a keen, manipulative social climber; Georgiana Darcy was bubbly and extrovert instead of being painfully shy; Mr. Collins was wooden and dull as opposed to being an obsequiously wily toadie (he was funny, though, I'll give him that); Darcy was portrayed as utterly misunderstood without pride, when we know that Darcy was definitely proud; and, though Keira Knightley is definitely spirited, she played Lizzie with liveliness and fire, but without the undeniable charm that tempered her faults and compelled us to forgive her trespasses.  Knightley's performance is also a little too forward and she is unable to subdue herself when necessary--basically, it's too modern a portrayal.Other reviewers have already poured over the script blunders, and I agree with most of them, but the ones that really stood out to me were:- Georgiana's wild hair, which was loose and looked absolutely unbrushed, along with her being portrayed as an extrovert.- Lady Catherine's late-night visit, with the entire Bennett clan standing around in their nightwear.- The rainstorm scene where Darcy proposes in clothes that are utterly drenched.- The inconsistencies with the costumes, particularly Lady Catherine's throwbacks and Caroline Bingley's modern, sleeveless numbers.- The inconsistencies with Longbourn.  It was rustic, dingy, and dirty--no doubt to make the Bennett's surroundings look more 'raw'--but they had servants at the ready in nearly every Longbourn scene.This isn't Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice; it's entirely someone else's vision of Pride and Prejudice.  Often times, I would wonder if the creators of the movie and I had even read the same book.  The scriptwriters thought that they had to help the story, that the story the way it is wouldn't work with audiences.  In the end, what was preserved of the original story was the only saving grace, with all the changes made with the plot done in poor taste.I understand that films and books are two entirely different creatures, and that there would be tremendous challenges for any movie seeking to portray a book's worth of material into a 2-hour film.  That, however, still does not excuse the dumbing down of the plot and dialogue.  One reviewer said that the film was too ""obvious,"" and I'm apt to agree.  Even my husband says that the movie was ""P&P; for Dummies.""  The movie was more of a typical romance novel featuring P&P; characters rather than a movie version of our beloved novel.In the end, the A&E; version is still vastly superior."	2.0	Hit and miss, but misses more often than hits	2006-08-13	37	26	11

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1L5JJ0HXW6U2C	Ganime B. Akin	"I have read the novel four times, watched the 1995 A&E; production numerous times, even seen the 1980 miniseries. But for me, this big screen adaptation is the best. True, it takes some liberties with the story: No way Elizabeth will go around Meryton without her bonnet, no way will Bingley come to visit Jane in her sick bed, no way Darcy will come into Lizzy's room when she is in her nightgown; Lady Catherine won't come in the middle of the night or Darcy won't propose in an ancient temple but these are not the important points. The important points are the realistic approach to the story, the gorgeous visuals, the great performances (especially by the lead actors) and the liveliness of the production.The film may seem a bit too hurried to those not familiar with the story. There is a lot going on and scenes go rushing along but the film does a good job of squeezing as many scenes and characters as possible in a 2 hour time frame. Mr Wickham is a bit left out, he just comes and goes but to tell the truth the actor's performance is so bad, it is better not to see more of him.Having considered Colin Firth as the ultimate Darcy for years, I am totally converted now. Matthew Macfadyen is the ultimate Darcy. His face conveys a whole lot of emotions and although Darcy was not supposed to be so expressive of her admiration of Elizabeth, I think there is no better way to convince the audience that he IS ""most ardently"" in love with Lizzy in around 2 hours. Keira Knightley is very good too. Although she giggles a little bit too much, her eyes and her voice express her emotions very well.Tom Hollander interprets Mr Collins differently here. In the 1995 version, Mr Collins was merely servile; here he comes across as quite cunning.Joe Wright directs the film brilliantly. The Assembly dance is so  exhilarating; you can almost smell the sweat. The ball scene is really superb.If you are a Jane Austen purist and like some Lord Of the Rings fanatics who think Sam's donkey shouldn't be excluded from the story in Lord of the Rings because the relationship between the man and the donkey was very important, you may find a lot of faults with this film. If not, you will certainly love it."	5.0	Wonderful, gorgeous	2006-05-30	16	12	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3SJD66YQAF265	"Gary Bisaga ""Christian Father and Husband"""	"I won't compare this movie much with the Colin Firth version because it's so different; rather, it needs to be compared against the book. And there are some things to really like in this version of the movie. First, it is the best short version I have seen. It would be extremely difficult to fit all of the book into a feature-length movie, and they do it very well. Unlike other versions, it doesn't leave out or alter many major parts. One technique that I was impressed with involved combining scenes (I am thinking primarily of the dinner party with Elizabeth speaking to Wickham) so that they were able to include most of the important story line points without requiring time-consuming additional scenes. I thought that was well-done.I also believe their version of Mr. Darcy better than any other characterization that I have seen. I have never believed that the ""Pride"" in Austen's title really referred to Mr. Darcy as he really was - only to him as Lizzy saw him. I have long felt that his apparent pride was due to lack of social skills and being ill at ease in the company of relative strangers. This hypothesis explains his amazing ""change"" that people often attribute to Lizzy's influence: I think it's obvious that what changed is her view of him, not his nature. This movie apparently agrees with my view - Mr. Darcy is shown, not prideful as Colin Firth sometimes was, but very vulnerable right from the beginning. I count that as a very strong point of this version.It's not perfect, of course. In some cases, I do think they cut out important elements. Wickham, for example, disappears from Lizzy's life without a trace (no mention of the Mary King affair, and not playing out his involvement with Georgeanna). Overall, he didn't come off as evil yet initially pleasing as he should have. As a Christian, Austen was well aware of how her characters related to beings in the spiritual realm, and I think Wickham should be a picture of Satan himself; in the movie he was just a somewhat bad man.I also do not like how they changed some lines around without any apparent reason. The worst example is from chapter 11 in the drawing room at Netherfield where Carolyn is trying to impress Mr. Darcy. In the book she says ""I should like balls infinitely better if ... conversation rather than dancing were made the order of the day."" To which Bingley replies, ""Much more rational ... but it would not be near so much like a ball."" This is a perfect example of Austen showing up Caroline for the ridiculous poser she was; but the movie has Lizzy's sister Mary saying it instead and Caroline, of all people, correcting her. This pretty much ruined the whole effect of what I think is one of the best lines of the book.Additionally, I have never thought that any representation of the relationship between Charlotte and Mr. Collins was true to the book; one of initial convenience on Charlotte's part, but which eventually turned into fondness for Collins' quirks, and finally into love. (The book admittedly does not lay this out clearly, but I believe it supports this view.)Finally, I think that one of the most negative characters in the entire book (next to Wickham, of course) is Mr. Bennet. Through his jokes, he never pays any attention to doing what is his primary job: providing (materially, emotionally, and spiritually) for his family. He's constantly in his library reading when he ought to be doing his real job. I don't think this came through at all. True, there was the one scene where he refused to stop Lydia from going to Brighton because he was tired of her whining; but that was it. In his final scene in the book, for example, he is relieved that Mr. Darcy paid for Lydia's wedding because that way he wouldn't have to worry about paying him back, and makes a little joke of it. In the movie, he seemed genuinely concerned about paying back Darcy, which was not at all true to his character.So, overall it is a good movie; and a good adaptation of the book, the best short one I have seen, but lacking in certain areas. I recommend that you see it, but you may want to have somebody well-acquainted with the book with you to point out the differences."	4.0	Good but not great	2006-04-13	16	9	7
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AY12DBB0U420B	Gary Peterson	"The movie for last night was ""Pride & Prejudice."" I found the DVD in our shelves and apparently it was something that my wife picked up and we failed to watch. Well, its a ""best-film-of-the-year"" type of movie no matter what year it might occur in. Without question. What can I possibly say? This movie already has over 1300 Amazon reviews and about 60% of them are five stars. And a lot of the reviews are exceptionally good. Well, it's a quite touching love story, actually two love stories, but I'm not going to dwell upon it. I'm just going to make a few remarks about things that especially impressed me.One was the setting. Magnificent! Where do they ever find such places in this modern world? The buildings and grounds were just immaculate! It was like being in the best park you could ever imagine. Everything was done to perfection and the photography was amazing. How do they ever manage to get big sweeping panoramic views with out a single power line, roadway or cars showing? Amazing! It really felt as if they had taken you way back to that pre-modern time. Does England have ""preserves"" like this just for the purpose of making classic movies?Secondly, the costumes were excellent! And so elaborate! And no doubt correct for the time. This movie paid attention to the details, believe me. And the interiors of some of the living quarters were just magnificent. Do the Brits really live like this? Well, I guess these were all upper-crust Brits, so I'll let this one pass by. However, any fancier of interior decorations and antiques is just going to be awe-struck by this movie. No expense was spared, and it's not some computer animation trick.Finally, the acting is just first rate. It always takes me a while to adjust to the stiff British methods, but it wasn't long before I felt like a part of the set and I laughed and suffered right along with the members of the cast. Well done! Also, the movie had an exceptionally good musical score. I thought the sound was a little too intrusive and interfered with the dialog here and there, but that's probably because it was set in surround sound and I watched it using a stereo sound system. In any case, this is just an exceptional movie. Five Stars!Gary Peterson"	5.0	Wonderful Movie!	2012-06-10	1	1	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ANZ29U5WO4MKR	"Gayle R. Simmonds ""Always A Reader"""	"I was extremely disappointed with this version of Pride and Prejudice. The director/writer (I don't know who) obviously felt that Jane Austen didn't write enough drama and ""real"" life into her book.  In a movie about a gentlemen and his wife who need to marry off 5 daughters within the limited confines of their small village, why is there a shot of a boar's testicles 5 minutes into the production?  It didn't add anything to the production and wasted time needed for the story.  Mr. Bennett was a gentlemen, so why didn't he ever shave?  Donald Sutherland just looked scruffy throughout the movie! The costumes were not true to any period in English history. If it was Georgian, all the ladies should have been wearing fitted to the waist dresses with full skirts, as Mrs. Bennett did.  Instead we get Lizzie in drab not quite high waisted (was it Empire?) dresses. Keira Knightly is flat chested and the Empire style of the time was very flattering to such a figure. Why was she not costumed well?  The dance scenes were chaotic.  These were assemblies and house parties held by and for the gentlemen's class, not the servants.  In this village and its surrounds there weren't that many people who would have been invited.  This wasn't Brighton or Bath at the height of the season! Just too much drama!  Lizzie out in the rain in the gazebo during her big confrontation with Mr. Darcy--where was that scene in the book? And people didn't travel very far in the dark!  So why on earth would Lady Catherine de Burg be calling on the Bennetts at midnight or later just to confront one of the daughters about her relationship with her nephew?  Lady Catherine de Burg was very strict on proper conduct and even enraged as she was, she would still have observed the proprieties. And where was Lydia's story?  This movie seemed to have been written by someone who hadn't read the original book and/or believed they could do a better job of telling the story!  The director/writer forgot that there were many threads woven together to tell the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. And Lydia's elopement with a seducer was integral to getting Darcy and Lizzie together!  All in all a big disappointment!  And it could have been so much better!"	1.0	Too many liberties	2010-01-16	20	15	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	APIODW29171J5	Gemini99	This is an amazing movie.  Joe Wright, the director, did a great job selecting the actors and with the cinematography.  He managed to capture the story in a two hour time frame and so this one shouldn't be compared to the 1995 BBC mini-series version.  If Wright took another 15-20 minutes, I'm sure the audience would not have minded.  Knightley and MacFadyen had wonderful chemistry, and there would have been more time for dialogue between them.  MacFadyen had much less screen time than you'd expect for this story, but he was convincing and filled the role of Darcy extremely well.  This movie definitely belongs in the video library for the romantics, and Jane Austen fans.I've had a DVD copy of this movie since it's original release, and recently decided it was worth it to have a Blu-Ray/ digital version too.  The Blu-Ray version looks great and there were a couple more bonus features compared to the original DVD release.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A10LO4GLFBUFEX	Genevive	"I wanted to like this movie, and I was prepared to accept a less than strict adaptation of the book, but I couldn't forgive the ridiculously indecorous little additions to a work based so heavily on the complexities of manner and conduct in Austenian society.  I didn't mind the family's poorness being enhanced to bring understanding to a modern audience of the wide breach between Bennett and Darcy, but I thought Knightly's coarse, greasy banged version of the subtle and witty Elizabeth went beyond the boundaries of ""youthful"" or ""exuberant"" and marched straight into the realms of the just plain inelegant.  For example, who thought it would be cute for Knightly to smack her food and lick her fingers at the breakfast table?  That kind of thing has nothing to do with youth or a modern adaptation--it's rude even today.  A main part of the original story was that Elizabeth and Jane had manners far superior to their family's, and were not themselves the objectionable ones.  Darcy even says as much at one point, a comment which was included in the movie's dialogue but hardly demonstrated in its acting.Elizabeth Bennett is one of my favorite literary characters, but all the things I like the most about her, her careful cleverness, her grace under fire, her classy superiority to the huffy rudeness dealt out to her by the upper class, were all but lost in this 'sassy farm girl meets stuck up rich dude' version of Austen's infinitely more subtle work.  In truth, this movie had a lot to live up to given the success of the BBC version (a fact which can be seen in its complete omission of that now famous scene where a dripping Darcy meets a shocked Elizabeth at his estate), but in my opinion, in its effort to do so, it simply overplayed its hand."	3.0	A Graceless Elizabeth	2006-05-10	24	15	9

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A123WSHXYSSZYY	Giana	After reading Jane Austen's novel, I have had many arguments with myself over the judgements placed upon Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. I have decided that in thinking of a title for her book, Austen was not assigning one characteristic to each character but instead she was assigning two equal qualities to both of the main characters. I used to think that Mr. Darcy, with his wealth and prominent upbringing, was too PROUD to be in the presence of commoners like the Bennets. Elizabeth on the other hand, after first witnessing Darcy's poor attitude and pride, made that her first and last impression of him. Ever since that moment, Lizzy became PREJUDICED toward Mr. Darcy and others like him. These qualities can also be switched; Darcy shows prejudice against people of lower rank or standing in society when he comments on Elizabeth's appearance or when later he addresses the entire Bennet family and their inappropriate behavior in public. Elizabeth could be considered proud in that she stands up for her family, her friends, and her way of life.After being able to support both characters under either quality, I still wonder whether or not these qualities are upheld at the end of the story. Interestingly enough, the characters didn't necessarily show prejudice against eachother, but against eachother's company and also against their own. Their union seems an obvious way to allow them both to continue to be negative toward eachother's relations and their own in the privacy of their shared home. I also believe that they both continue to be proud individuals because with confidence and self esteem comes pride in one's self. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet sis not change at all throughout the story, they simply found in eachother the perfect match, both proud and prejudiced to the core.	5.0	Pride OR Prejudice?	2006-04-27	13	7	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1TZT51E2M4DX8	Gigo De Guzman	"I must confess that I have not yet read the book, but watching this movie has persuaded me to.Though some do not approve of this film version of the novel, I have to say that I understand them. I am not fond of period movies, so the idea of watching this film was far from my thoughts. One boring afternoon, with nothing else to do, I decided to view the film. I did not pay attention at first, but little by little, I began watching it. By the end, I was crying because of the last scene.(Note: There are two endings to this film. The US version has Lizzie and Darcy kissing. The UK version ends with the intimate moment with Lizzie and her father. I cried at the UK ending.)A few days later, I decided to watch the movie once more. This time, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. So far, I've viewed the film 5 times and counting.It is a masterpiece on its own. With its spectacular scenery, Colorful imagery, and moving score, one has to view this film more than twice to fully enjoy what this movie really has to offer. As I watched the film, I felt as if I was reading a piece of literature: fluid in motion as if from your own imagination.The symbolisms in this film are abundant (Take note: The film aims to depict the film as if from the  POV of Lizzie. Notice the constant shoot where we are able to see what Lizzie sees, like viewing herself in the mirror or viewing Lydia's departure from the window.) Whats more is the set designers characterization of the settings to complement the characters living in them (Example: The Bennet house possessed vibrant colors similar to the Bennet family. Darcy's home gives a mysterious, great but modest grandeur similar to Darcy himself.) Then the Music... OH MY... the music is heavenly! Enough said.The story flows quick and well. It does not drag in certain parts, allows full coverage of the main story without making the film too long.I have viewed the BBC 1995 TV series of the novel upon recommendation my many. For me, I did enjoy the TV version seeing as it seemed appropriate for television. But to be honest, I prefer this version better. One notable thing about this version is that you don't go hating any of the dislikable characters like Mrs Bennet, Mr Collins, etc. The film gives them depth and so in the end, instead of hating them totally, you tend to understand them.The well-rounded characters, the breath-taking scenery, the emotionally moving score, and the vibrant colors of the imagery makes this film a work of art.To add to this: as a guy, I did not expect to appreciate the intensity of the crucial romantic scenes, but I did. It surprised me but I was actually able to relate to Mr Darcy's character during those moments. I felt the moment.The humor of the film is also something to behold. It takes careful attention in order to catch many of its humor (Such as Ms Bingley's line ""For God's sake, Are we to receive every Bennet in the county?!"" or Lizzie's reaction as she enters the room after reading Jane's letter about Kitty) Some jokes are not so obvious at first, but when you understand the situation, you laugh so hard. It's very witty and sarcastic.The Acting... Keira being nominated for BEST ACTRESS at the Oscars says enough. Matthew is a great actor (Why wasn't he nominated?!). I've seen some of his work and I dare say that this is best work (For me that is). Playing a grown man who falls in love like a little boy is not an easy thing to do.For those who dislike this film, may I ask you to take another look. For those who liked it, view it again so you would love it more.As my Literature teacher once said ""A good piece of literature is one which you have to read or view more than once in order to enjoy the various layers of the work"". This is what this version offers."	5.0	Perfection...	2006-05-18	20	14	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A32OM7MJ8JPPMN	Girl Gwen	Here's a challenge for you: Try watching this movie *without* comparing it to the 1995 miniseries. While the miniseries was fabulous, there's much to love in this movie.The chemistry between the two leads is remarkable. Matthew MacFadyen's Mr. Darcy smolders and suffers with his love for Elizabeth Bennet. He literally made me sigh (and nearly swoon). And Keira Knightley is fresh, energetic and lovely in the role of Miss Bennet.The scenery made me want to catch a flight to England and find a misty moor to wander. The soundtrack strikes a perfect note throughout. The supporting cast is everything it should be.So forget for a second the 1995 version. Forget for a moment more the ways the screenplay strays from Miss Austen's words. And then enjoy a sweet, rich, heart-warming love story that stands the test of time.	5.0	Wonderful, fresh version of an old favorite!	2006-01-23	20	15	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A21XVS00AIENLX	"G. Jennings ""G. J."""	Loved the movie and I don't even like Jane Austen's stories.This interpretation was completely honest and surprisingly contemporary while still using Austen's words to effectively portray the emotions of the characters.  Keira, for such a tiny thing, is surpringly forceful and powerful in her prideful portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett.  Her acting style is so natural that you wonder if she was acting at all.  If Reese Witherspoon hadn't won the Oscar, it clearly would have gone to Keira Knightly.  I haven't seen the Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice, but this was well done, straighforward yet still cinematically beautiful and pleasant.I'd love to see more of Keira in strong roles which is what she's clearly suited for.  English Rose she may be, but dainty dame she is not.  Clearly a lovely tomboy who can hang with the boys...which acocunts for her solid performance in Bend it Like Beckham. Her off screen persona is not too far off.  When interviewed on the Red Carpet by Isaac Mizrahi, she told him with quick frankness she didn't think she would win.  Mizrahi responded that she needed a plan when her name was called.Keira:  Whether or not I win, I'm going to party afterwards.Mizrahi:  Great!  Who are you going with to the party?Keira: I don't know...I'm just going to...follow people.Now that's how a 20 year old talks.  You could tell she was clearly there to have fun and wasn't taking herself too seriously.Star in the making.  She's got plenty of time for Oscars.  Might as well enjoy herself.	5.0	Loved it!	2006-03-14	13	7	6
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A34WNB5028JTVE	G. Joseph	This movie had all the ingredient of a great film but one. It is the script.  I mean the acting was perfect. Keira gave a brilliant performance as Elizabeth, and Matthew grew on me as Darcy. But the script readers the script!!....It really suck..The writers too much  poetic license when they try to modernize the story.  In doing so they alienated the core fan of P&P.; I liked the 1995 version but always thought some of the character were miscast and too old to play the part(ie Jenifer Erhle as Elizabeth, Wickham, Caroline Bingley, The Gardiners). This time around I like the cast and hate the story line.  I only pray that the next attempt will be the correct one.I still recommend the purchase of that movie. In fact I have pre-odered it myself.  If one can get over the imperfection of the story  and its failed attempt at modernization ( Elizabeth not wearing gloves at the Netherfield ball, the new version of Georgiana dealing with Wickham, Elizabeth getting even with Darcy at the Meryton assembly, The Rosing proposal...), you will find it quite a delightful tale.In a world where movies seemed to be laced with violence, questionable take on morality, this  movie is one of best family friendly film made.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1ZO50OT4JTJIX	"globetrotter ""globetrotter"""	"Wow!  I've seen nearly all the film versions of Pride and Prejudice, and this one is by far my favourite.  Here, viewers are treated to gorgeous cinematography showing off amazing English vistas.  Of course, I realize that this film is not a verbatim play by play of the book, but it certainly caught my attention and kept me interested straight to the end.  Keira Knightly is perfect as Elizabeth (""Lizzie"") Bennett.  She plays Lizzie just as I imagine her, headstrong and passionate.  I also love Matthew McFadden as Mr. Darcy.  He is very sexy!  Plus he doesn't play as stoic a Mr. Darcy as Colin Firth in the BBC version.  In this version of Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Darcy is visibly affected and thrown off by his attraction to Lizzie from the very beginning.  Some reviewers may object to this lack of subtlety and nuance, but I found it appealing.  Overall, I think this film was aimed at a younger audience.  The dialogue was less 19th century English, but more of today's plain language (note, the use of ""divine goddess"" etc.).  The film also focused more on the Bennett family and the romance between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy rather than the broader scope of the book which focuses on social structure among other things.  While this Pride and Prejudice may not appeal to Austen purists, I was thoroughly entertained!"	5.0	Wow!	2006-03-01	11	8	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A7Y6AVS576M03	gobirds2	PRIDE & PREJUDICE is a handsomely mounted production, moodily filmed with a pervasive dark texture of visual expression about it. It is quite a visual presentation of the story where dialogue is left unspoken and the power of the images both animate and inanimate speak for themselves. That is not to say that the film goes on without dialogue, but rather quite the opposite. The many exchanges of dialogue are witty, brilliantly structured, eloquently spoken and presented with an economy of style that is concisely intelligent. This film with its intricately mounted visuals and words does an admirable job of bringing this literary work to the screen with all the constraints inherent in the medium of the cinema. Director Joe Wright also did a more than commendable job of representing the two main characters. Keira Knightley gives an awe-inspiring performance as Lizzie giving her great insight of the human condition. Lizzie though impetuous at times has a gift of rationalizing human behavior with a certain sense of reality offsetting loftier romantic ideals thus making her a young woman of keen intelligence. I truly enjoyed Matthew MacFadyen's performance as Darcy. He seems a young man tired and perplexed by convention but knows no other way to conduct himself and is trapped by his by his social status but more importantly by his own upbringing. Matthew MacFadyen's does an exceptional job conveying this. Awkwardly trying to emote his inner feelings he does more to alienate Lizzie than win her affections. MacFadyen's Darcy is truly a man misunderstood. Only through good and anonymous deeds can the true nature of the man prevail. I think this is a very good film rich with artistic fervor yet embracing all that is good of the human spirit. The DVD extras are very good.	5.0	Concise and Exquisitely Beautiful Production and DVD	2006-03-07	17	13	4

This film will have that effect on a person.. Especially if the person had sat through the more detailed and finely done BBC version and, let's not forget, someone who has read the book too.I didn't like the ending..""Divine goddess?""""..Bewitched me body and soul?""  What was that? That really sugar-coated the much anticipated coming together of Lizzy and Darcy.. It was ""gaggifying"" and elementary...This isn't comparing apples and oranges. 10 years later another remake is made of this popular story and is put out in the market for people to devour. I know some of us will stay allied with the miniseries and/or novel, but this current remake is just a story for people to be entertained by. Some won't understand how important it is for a woman to get married, in Elizabeth Bennet's time frame. It is mentioned of course, but the key points in this film are about love concerning Lizzy and Jane. The story is cut and pasted together while we can't appreciate the worlds of the other characters. There isn't a way to tell this story in under two hours though, is there?The acting isn't bad at all. The actors/actresses get into character and don't leave us yawning. I know females tend to wish to be beautiful and in love. They wish to be in some sort of romantic tension with some dashing man. It's all fun and games. This adaptation serves those people. ""Awww!""The scenery and costumes aren't overdone. I am glad to see them NOT wearing ball gowns.  ""Lizzy"" is quite lean though, but none-the-less confident looking. ""Darcy"" looks like what a stubborn, handsome man in that era should look like. He softens up too much towards the end, wearing that ""love struck"" daze on his face. He isn't supposed to be a bitter,pompous man in the end. I just wasn't expecting him to be a a creme puff either. Give Darcy some dignity. ""Jane"" looked like as humble as she should be. She wore a lot of innocense on her face. She was beautiful though.The Characters were adapted as accurate as this film can limit it, but in the end, we could all pinpoint who's who in the film even if they remaind nameless through the whole performance.Watch the film or don't.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	"Some will ask ""how many versions of Jane Austen's read-to-the-point-of-fraying 'Pride and Prejudice' do we need?""  The current film archives show no fewer than ten versions and growing.  But for this viewer the current P & P du jour is as satisfying as any, edited and distilled to its main story lines without diminishing the main message from the author. Deborah Moggach can be thanked for the screenplay (with some subtle revisions by Emma Thompson) and Joe Wright  for his sensitive and forward momentum directing approach.So what make this version different and successful?  First, the placement of the Bennet family in the pig and mud friendly country home that sets the scene properly for the driver of the film - finding proper husbands for the five daughters whose well placed marriages will assure the lower class Bennet family a future stability.  Yes, it is a bit untidy, this household, but that makes it a family more dependent on the land and more prone to dreams of 'marrying up' in a country ruled by class system. Second, the casting of the Bennnet family with five truly young actresses (Keira Knightly, Rosamund Pike, Talulah Riley, Jena Malone, Carey Mulligan) instead of older types trying to appear like teenagers; a mother (Brenda Blethyn) who indeed shows her desperation of class; and a father (Donald Sutherland) who epitomizes Austen's father figure mold.  Add to the Bennets the credible men characters of Simon Woods, Matthew Macfadyen, Tom Hollander, and  Cornelius Booth and top it all off with a pivotal Lady Catherine de Bourg of Judi Dench and all players are in place for a fine cast.  The dialogue is crisp and sharp and the usual diversions into lineage names and sidebars are eliminated, bringing this long story down to just over two hours.The scenery and costumes are superb as is the cinematography by Roman Oshin and the musical score by Dario Marianelli  with a lot of help from Henry Purcell.  Is it one of the best movies of the year?  Perhaps, perhaps not, depending on taste. But it is nice to see Keira Knightly shine in a role more challenging than any she has had to date.  She inhabits Elizabeth Bennet luminously.  Grady Harp, March 06"	4.0	Distilled Austen Makes for a Fine Brew	2006-03-01	11	9	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2H9VMR8QRLINY	granite	I am not British, I haven't seen the BBC version and have no idea of the minutiae of aristocratic surroundings in the UK to be too distressed about the Bennett house. I read the book, but not recently, so I cannot offer a detailed comparison of what was altered. Perhaps because of these factors I was surprised about the mixed reviews this film has gotten.I really liked this film for its emotional intensity, social commentary and beautiful cinematography. Love is unique enough today, when most people's choices are far less circumscribed than in the 19th century. At the time, it was the exception many dreamed about and few experienced, at least in their marriage. Pride and Prejudice is about women's lives, where compromise rules and the rational decision of Charlotte is the order of the day. The necessity of marrying for financial security gives even the most unsuitable men the pick of quite adequate women.The social hierarchy is clear and oppressive and all of us romantics watching it :) root for love to upset it. The pacing of the film allows us to understand the way Lizzy's and Darcy's feelings develop (by contrast, we are told of Jane's and Bingley's feelings, but do not experience them) and although we may know what comes next, we can still hold our breath. When at the end of the film, for example, Darcy comes to visit early in the morning, we watch him approach, rather than cut to him appearing and then talking to Lizzy. An important conversation is given weight by editing. These are the details that give the film its intensity. The actors are wonderful, a complex mixture of well-bred manners and uncontrollable emotion.Finally, the images of the countryside are striking in their beauty and rich detail rules even the indoor scenes. I actually regret that I haven't seen this film in the theater and I am seriously considering buying it. As this rarely happens to me, I can strongly recommend this movie :)	5.0	I am thinking of buying this	2006-03-31	13	8	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3LU79BYMWZEW9	Gregor von Kallahann	"Yes, it's true.  A two-hour movie can't cover as much ground as a five-hour mini-series, and it may be unfair to expect it to.  What is a reasonable demand, however, would be expect the filmmakers to make judicious cuts in the narrative and not to rush, rush, rush through a fairly complex storyline and to run roughshod over the elegant dialogue that the story's original author provided her flawed, but self-aware and articulate characters.This film's failings--when compared to the artistic success of the 1995 BBC series--begs the question as to whether or not a novel this rich and this subtle doesn't deserve a full five or more hours to unfold on film.  Maybe that's the only real way to translate Austen's literary genius successfully to a visual medium.For the first half hour or so, I thought the problem may have just been me.  But when we got to the ""Mr. Collins"" scenes, I knew something internal to the film had gone awry.  The equivalent passages in the book--as well as the equivalent scenes in the 1995 production--make for masterful comic moments.  In this film, it's BING (Collins arrives) BANG (he proposes to Elizabeth, who rejects him completely) and BOOM (he marries Charlotte).  The acting is fine--especially Tom Hollander, who has some fine comic moments as Collins.  But the timing is way off.I will give director Joe Wright and his collaborators credit for coming up with a top flight ensemble cast overall.  There has been considerable attention payed to the casting of Keira Knightley, who is somewhat closer in age to her character than previous Elizabeths had been, and there is something to be said for that kind of ""age appropriateness.""  All well and good.  She's a fine young actress.  But her dialogue--like so much else in the movie--is too rushed and therefore almost awkward.  Elizabeth should speak with a kind of regal self-confidence.  That she doesn't quite manage that may not be Knightley's fault.  It's hard to be a witty and spirited conversationalist when you're obliged to dash through your lines.Matthew McFadyen as the more taciturn Darcy has it somewhat easier.  Like most educated young men of his class and of his era--and like any proper Austen hero--he is supremely well-spoken when he chooses to speak. McFadyen is an appealing actor, and certainly not a bad Darcy (he will have his camp followers, just as Colin Firth has his), but just about all he has time for is a furrowed brow here, a wounded look there.Probably the only really bad casting is that of Judi Dench as the Queen of the Night--I mean, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  In British cinema, Dench is, of course, an institution.  Here unfortunately, she's more of a mental institution.  Her moments onscreen are almost painful to watch.  Someone on this site (perhaps the Amazon critic?) has kindly described her performanceas ""full throttle.""  That's polite for ""overkill.""Well, she does liven things up a bit.  But what we really need and what we really expect from any production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a certain esprit,  a sense of narrative driven by intelligent, incisive dialogue.  That's where the subtle social satire comes in.  Do away with that and you have a romantic 19th Century love story.  Not bad, but not all it could be.  And not really what it's supposed to be either.PS--I notice I received a number of ""non-helpful"" votes within less than 24 hours of posting this qualified (not actually NEGATIVE) review.  Well, people are certainly entitled to their opinions (just as I am entitled to mine).  However, I do wish readers of these reviews would learn to make the distinction between ""non-helpful"" and  ""I disagree with this.""  If a negative (or mixed) review gets you to THINK about why you liked the work in question, then, kids, it is HELPFUL.  You just happen to disagree with it.  I sometimes get the impression that some readers out there want nothing more than to see their own biases confirmed.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2E7KC0EI7QT8	"Greg Pauletti ""gdpetti"""	Yes, loved it, as I didn't really know it and only read the book and watched other earlier versions as a result. Knightley is perfect in the part, and the rest are well placed as well, though the girls should've looked a little different in age to be precise. The only problem, once you know the book and Austin's life/material is that the director, which did such an excellent job in the first half, only did an average job in the second. That mirror scene failed, and should have been cut in the editting room if not later before release. The feel of the book was changed too much in the second half from the man's sister to the lack of walking scenes, so that the sense of history is lost in an attempt to 'modernize' the storyline, forgetting that the essence can be lost in the same process.All that said, I feel it is the best version I've seen. Others have had a better sense of historical accuracy but the female leads just weren't 'right' for the part in my opinion. Knightley seemed to be made up as Austin at times and the feel of the characters seemed more true, even if so many changes were made by the end. She is the only actress that 'was' the character in all the version's I've seen, the others either didn't have the look or the feel or age to play the part... again, in my opinion, as today's 'taste' has changed over the past few decades. I just wish the second half of the script could've been rewritten and reshot, a couple of great 'walking' scenes would have made better adaptations to film drama/comedy than what the director/writer choose for whatever reason they had at the time, but again, if I had to point to one, I'd take this shortened version over the other longer ones, that seemed so dull by comparison, some of which is a statement of British tv production values or lack of, at the time. The quality has improved to 'Hollywood' standards of production and presentation, for better and for worse, that's life here in Purgatory.	5.0	Pride and Prejudice 2005	2012-12-30	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3NCR8O1ZZ8EJU	G. Toscano	I've always loved Pride and Prejudice. More so, when I discovered the BBC version, most fondly known as the Colin Firth version. I have nothing but praised for that mini-series, and I have fallen in love with the story even more. I love how repressed and snooty Darcy is, how charmingly snarky Lizzie can be. There was also a sense of maturity in the mini-series, and most probably, it was influenced by the casting of older actors that resulted in that. It worked well for them. All in all, the numerous times that I have watched it in entirety is a testament to my love for it. And then I hear there's a new version coming out with Keira Knightley as Lizzie and some guy as Darcy. How dare they attempt to remake it, when possibly the definitive version has already been done?!I have heard that many Austen purists are in uproar over this and I can see why. It's not your mother's Jane Austen, for one thing -- while some may think that's an insult, I mean it as a compliment. This new version is less polite, less genteel; it's also less repressed and more in-your-face, well, as in-your-face one can be in breeches and cravats. Whereas the BBC version used its 6 hours to meet and match and flirt and separate the characters, the movie has less of that luxury so it makes up for it by being more fiery and earthier, more emotional and even more confrontational. It's also very young,in the best sense of the word.  It's fresh and new, and I would have love to see this version fleshed out to its full width and breadth, rather than just the abbrieviated version that I watched. But even then, the experience is wonderfully involving.  Here, emotions are always on the verge of breaking through the surface, making the passions more heightened and the anguish more excuciating. And love is felt in all its giddy, painful, confusing glory. A lot has to be said for Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen taking on roles that have been done (and brilliantly before). Yet I actually like their new takes on the characters: Knightley's Lizzie is less polished but equally as witty and charming, while MacFadyen's Darcy is less self-possesed and more vulnerable but equally as snooty (and later adorably, meltingly romantic).I love the touches that made this movie fresh:1) The characters of Jane and Bingley are more defined, and that's something that is better than the mini-series. There, she comes out as bland while he seems almost retarded while here, Jane's more animated and self-possessed while Bingley is charmingly nervous, adorably shy and sweet-tempered.2) During the dance, when they were arguing and suddenly, only the two of them are left dancing and sniping at each other -- this is a very imaginative take on the whole cliche of having eyes for only one person, even in the midst of a dance and in the middle of an argument.3) The almost kiss after Lizzie rejected Darcy. The look on his face was so wonderful, seeing as we can view how much it was hurting him to turn away while she was surprised at her seeming to want him to kiss her. *sigh*  They are so attracted to one another depite hating each other's guts. Lovely...and soooo hot. (p.s. I so wanted to hug and kiss him for that little boy lost look when he realzied that she said no to him).I thought I would never see anyone else fill Darcy's shoes but Colin Firth but in this version, Matthew MacFadyen acquits himself wonderfully and so deos Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennett.	4.0	Younger, Fiercer, (sometimes even) Better	2006-01-15	65	57	8

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1A9CK2UC2WZNX	hadassah well	This is not the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. They are a bit too stuck on themselves, too impressed with their own talents. It bespeaks arrogance rather than quality. The characters in the Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth have a sweetness that is complimented by intelligence. Even the bonus features betray that the actors are more impressed with themselves than they are interested in delivering a great performance. I fault the director to a degree. He shifts many lines that were meant for the young ladies' father in the story to Keira Knightly. She comes off as pompous rather than intelligent.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1WTU39D2NQ26U	hawaiianstyle	"I rarely give reviews, but seriously, this is a movie, not a history lesson. It had two hours to tell a story. The director and his posse did their homework in many ways, but they also used the medium of cinema to help move along the story as well.Take the sculpture part of the story-it was a very important part of the storytelling because of the compacted timeframe here. Lizzy in this version just got back from turning down Darcy's proposal when swoop! The aunt and uncle take her off to Derbyshire country and Darcy's pad. Hmmm, within a space of 5 minutes we have Lizzy telling Darcy he sucks, to being affected by him. If we didn't use the sculpture vehicle, she would have looked mercenary-""oh, look at Darcy's hot estate, I think I like him now."" But that's the NOT the storyline-she isn't mercenary. How is a director suppossed to convey this?I think Joe Wright took advantage of the medium of cinema and bridged the timeframe gap by allowing the sculptures to convey Lizzy's realization of her prejudice, her blindness, and her awakening feelings for Darcy(look at the statues used--- a ""veiled"" woman, Achilles ""the heel guy"" statue, etc. and finally Darcy's statue.)And how long did that bridge scene take to convery regret,hindsight, self awareness, and true feelings? Like a minute! Clever if you ask me.I mean, the point is that with a compacted timeframe to tell the story, sometimes you take liberties in conveying the spirit of the story, if not the plotpoints.I thought this was a great adaption for the medium used here."	5.0	oh, lighten up folks!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AWV3IHQ1D2S59	Haworth	"The opening scenes of this adaption had me thinking I was watching The Woodlanders or Tess ( and Keira Knightly would make such a beautiful Tess) and continued Hardy style to the ending scene whereupon ""Heathcliff""/ Darcy is seen striding across the misty moors to a dark ""Cathy""/Eliza.It is however a very enjoyable film and a good romp despite its lacking in Austen's precise prose and witty dialogue. Like a good Shakespeare, I don't see why there cannot exist many adaptations; in the last 10 years or so there have been 3 Hamlets put on film. And why not, when we enjoy them so much?The performances in this film are wonderful - although I blame the director for allowing Knightly's 'wild behaviour' as Eliza, which put her in the same basket as her 3 silly sisters and has you wondering why on earth Darcy would fall for such a reckless woman when she has nothing else to recommend her.Does Working Title pictures understand the meaning of IRONY? The Bennets were by no means poor people simply because they had no heir to Longbourne Estate. (Just as Briget Jones, fussing over her weight all the time, was not a heffalump - as portrayed by Ms. Zellweger in the second installment). Estate may have been a key word to hint at their postion in society.One Bingley sister on her own doesn't carry the capacity for the nastiness of two, so that was a shame.I really appreciated this film giving Mary a pretty face. Why sould a fondness for reading scripture and being alone make you unattractive? I should have liked to have seen more of her character giving her unwanted quotations.A pity also that Charlotte Lucas was made to look like a girl who feeds pigs for a living. No self important sychophant like Mr. Collins would marry such a girl.I know it is a long way from Austen's Pride and Prejudice but it is still highly enjoyable and has some great performances from Dame Judi Dench, Brenda Blethyn, and Tom Hallander, to name a few. The music is gorgeous and so are the dance scenes.I look forward to another adaption in a few years. Who knows...maybe someone will be brave enough to do the film in two parts as with the brilliant french double feature ""Joan of Arc -the battles"" and ""Joan of Arc - the prisons"", starring Sandrine Bonnaire. It could be done and it could be brilliant!"	3.0	Thomas Hardy meets Wuthering Heights	2006-04-21	17	12	5

But if you can take this movie as it is, without comparing it to the literary work too much, you will simply fall in love.Everything about this movie is enchanting. Kiera Knightly does a fabulous job of playing the spirited Elizabeth Bennet, completely unaware of her own beauty for in society it does not compare to her sisters.  But the person that really makes this movie is Matthew MacFadyen, who plays Mr. Darcy.  He truly captures all of the unlikeable traits of Mr. Darcy in the beginning, and has you completely in love with him at the end.Tom Hollander is Mr. Collins and he captures him completely.  The dance scene between he and Lizzie alone is worth the price of the movie.Visually entertaining, it's like taking a peek through a magical looking glass and catching the smallest glimpse of what life must have been like in England near 1800.  Austen was truly a master of writing about the kind of love that would escape her.  Every girl should have a Mr. Darcy.	5.0	Simply Lovely	2008-05-11	5	4	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A12UM9KG51KUHU	Heather Bowers	"This movie is incredible.  Almost every review will mention the 1995 mini series with Colin Firth, and who wouldn't, Colin Firth is a peach.  But Matthew MacFadyan is an amazing actor, and he has this craggy, rough, gorgeous nature.  He was excellent in the series ""spooks,"" Stateside it was called MI-5 and its available on A&E.com.;  Kiera is a sweetheart and she shows a different side in this movie, as opposed to Bend it like Beckham and Pirates of the Caribbean, she is more intense, and she is the perfect Elizabeth.  All other characters are cast well, especially the mother.  And though Judi Dench has a small appearence she is magnificant as usual.I was surprised at how much they squeezed into this movie.  The mini-series covered everything, and the older version from the 70's I think did a fine job at sticking to the novel quite well.  It does move fast, and perhaps if you've never ever heard of Pride and Prejudice, and you don't know the storyline, or you can't quite catch the brit. accent, you might have difficulty keeping up.  But its beautifully done, a fresh new view, with all shots blasting color at the audience.  The clothes have a traditional, yet, less formal feel...the sets are also less...itchy, less form-fitting, like the pinch of a over-starched shirt perhaps?  And Pemberly, oh my heavens, Pemberly is gorgeous, the houses are gorgeous.This review, I gaurantee you, won't do the movie justice...see it, watch it, buy it..you'll love it."	5.0	In Love with Elizabeth and Darcy	2006-02-04	18	13	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2HB0QPG0M93CG	"Heather Burwell ""Heather-Anne"""	If you are a Jane Austen fan rather than a Pride and Prejudice fan steer clear of the film.The film does have it merits such as Knightley's performance and the first propsal scence.The problem with the film is the liberties that screenwriter and director have taken. Proper decorum and standards of that time period are not observed. The interaction between characters have much more modern sensibilities than that of Austen's 19th century work. Additionaly hair styles and costumes where not of the correct time period as well. Even those who have not read the book but enjoy period dramas will find this annoying.There are mistakes in relationships between characters. Additionally scence and interactions towards the end are completely changed from the book. Also in general the time frame. Pride and Prejudice took place over 18 months.The relationship between Darcy and Wickham was never fully explained and I had to explain to others the full extent of that relationship.The biggest problem for this purist is the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet is not fully built. One of the key points of this relationship is built during the days at Pemberly and when Lizzy gets the letter from Jane. We do not see the relationship build at Pemberly. But the worst part is that when she gets the letters from Jane and tells Darcy the Aunt and Uncle are present.This is the moment in the book where you see the most tenderness from Darcy and in this movie it is interupted by other relations being present.Overall it is entertaining for those who have not read the book and a fun diversion. If your a purist the fun would be in spotting the numerious mistake that are made.	2.0	Not for a Purist	2005-12-08	17	10	7

Macfadyen's Darcy is too soft. Mr. Collins is not funny. Authors mocked his height. Is it all that you can laugh at in this character?!! I don't think so. They also made Bingley look absolutely dumb. Although I loved the cinematography, music, and costumes, I didn't enjoy the movie at all. Irritated most of the time. Sorry. Don't understand some exalted reviews posted here.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3H317GL67MWC4	"HesedBooks ""Gifts for Readers and Writers"""	"I was wary of watching this edition of ""Pride and Prejudice"" because I was absolutely convinced that it was going to be horrible, either because of the acting, or because it wouldn't stay true to the story as it is presented in the novel. But I definitely ate some humble pie after watching this film because it turned out to be absolutely wonderful, and did Jane Austen's novel adequate justice.While the movie is not as detailed as the novel - or the original BBC series - due to time constraints, the creators of the movie did a good job of choosing the important points of the story to focus on. While you don't want the movie to end when it does, you can at least feel like you've been given a complete and well rounded story before placing the DVD back in its case.The actors selected to portray such timeless literary characters were also well chosen; while I doubted Keira Knightley's ability to pull off the role of Elizabeth, I came away with a new respect for her acting ability after watching this film. The choice of Matthew MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy was also a good one; he played the brooding, but genuinely kind-hearted Mr. Darcy very convincingly. The online chemistry between Knightley and MacFadyen was also evident, enhancing the believability of Elizabeth and Darcy's romance when it was portrayed onscreen.While the cinematography in this movie varied greatly from the original BBC series, it was for the better. Some of the most crucial moments in the book - when Darcy professes his feelings for Elizabeth, and the ending where they meet in the early morning - were beautifully filmed. For those who are not interested in romantic movies, but appreciate good cinematography, watch this movie for that reason alone; you will not be disappointed.Though this film was wonderful, if you are comparing it to the book, or are a diehard fan of the original BBC series, you might come away disappointed. But for those who have never read the book, or ever seen the original BBC series, this is definitely a film that you need to add to your must-watch list."	5.0	I Started Out Prejudiced...	2008-10-12	13	10	3

Fortunately our min personages visualized these taboos and could surpass it to find their bliss. The film is extremely slow until the first half, then it revitalizes through smart dialogues and unavoidable confrontations.

Everything happened so quickly, you couldn't keep up. I had to turn on the subtitles and rewind several times to figure out what was going on. The characters were skimmed over and unbelievable. The lighting was nice, but that was the high point of the film. My advice: Stick with the BBC mini series version.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3H3NI647NBMXL	Hobbit Wannabe	"I am completely ""prejudiced"" because I LOVE the A&E; version.  I did at least hope to find Mr. Darcy handsome. Unfortunately this movie was a very big disappointment.Elizabeth Bennet: Played by Keira Knightly, she lacked... spirit. When talking with Mr. Darcy at the ball, she's supposed to be enjoying this clever and witty word play, but she just talks like anyone else would. And why does it seem like she's attracted to Darcy before he even proposes? She's supposed to find him insufferable. While many reviewers said they felt they could relate to Knightly better than Jennifer Ehle of the A&E; version, I didn't feel any connection at all. She showed very little emotion at all when she wasn't ranting angrily, and I simply didn't find her performance entrancing.Mr. Darcy: Someone told me that they thought Matthew Macfadyen cuter than Colin Firth, so I may have had my expectations too high, but... I thought Macfadyen rather ugly! I'm sorry, and I think he's very nice-looking in real life. But as Mr. Darcy... ugh! Also, he didn't make a convincing ""insufferable"" Mr. Darcy. Darcy is supposed to be rather rude, cold, and arrogant. Macfadyen simply looked either bored or sleepy.Mr. Collins: Oh, what a travesty! He's hardly even in the movie, and he didn't really seem to care a twopence about Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  This Mr. Collins was incredibly dull, his only advantage being his shortness.Mr. Bennet: Donald Sutherland lacks Mr. Bennet's dry wit and sarcasm, much too quiet and beaten down to be interesting. Also, it looked like he hardly ever shaved. With his long hair and scruffy chin, I kept thinking he looked like a cross between Benjamin Franklin and a pirate.Dialogue: Choppy, rushed, and SO watered down from Austen's original. They talked so fast that it was like they were afraid of running out of time and had to spit out every line as fast as they could.Costuming: Although a bit more attractive to our 21st century eyes than that of A&E;, it does not feel as authentic. Miss Bingley's dress in particular is ridiculous, having no sleeves and only very thin straps.Music: The one area in which this movie shines, although the music is not as authentic to the time period as that in A&E.;I had fairly low expectations when I started this movie, but I really tried to like it. Unfortunately, I found the events rushed and chopped, the characters cast quite poorly, and the over-all movie pretty lame. I was more bored in two hours than I've ever been in the five hour-long version. If you're looking for a good one, I would recommend the 1995 A&E; TV serial."	1.0	Why did they even bother?	2010-11-23	10	5	5

I know the mother/sisters are supposed to be annoying, but the ones in the BBC version I couldn't even watch. I did like Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, probably the only reason I watched because I love Colin Firth. But Matthew MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy is splendid!

And my favorite quote from him is, &#34;You have bewitched me in body and soul, and I love, I love, I love you.&#34;Keira Knightley is one of my fave actresses, just loved her in Love Actually and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies (ironically, she plays an Elizabeth in the Pirates movies too).

I've read it a dozen times, so like most true fans, I would like movies about to stick true to the real story. But I appreciate this movie a lot. I've seen four different Pride and Prejudice movies and in all of them, I think Keira Knightley is just the perfect Elizabeth. She's the right age, the right look and seems to have the right spunk. I enjoyed the unraveling of Matthew MacFadyen's Darcy. I felt he did all he could with the character, given the time constraints. I did like Colin Firth's version but I felt Jennifer Ehle was way too old to be Elizabeth. Did I love Colin Firth's Darcy? Sure but he had the luxury of a mini-series to make women understand him better.Anyway, this movie is a quick P&P; fix, using some creative liberties to meet the challenge of a movie.

Sutherland's performance is positively awesome, especially very near the end, when he indeed brought tears to my eyes.Matthew Macfadyen is a wonderfully fine and always believable actor, making you feel his emotions as Darcy, in what is a near flawless performance.  Although some might say he's not as totally overall physically ''attractive'' as Colin Firth's earlier performance in the same role, in very many ways Macfadyen is.. indeed Darcy.See this film... If for nothing else to admire the ''rapid fire speed of speech'', and downright emotion packed scene that takes place between Knightley's and Macfadyen's characters in the pouring rain.Overall, a pure pleasure to watch, as I've done again and again.	5.0	Keira Knightley ''is'' Austen's Elizabeth Bennet	2013-08-18	2	1	1

The latter is superior in all respects IF you have actually read and appreciate Jane Austen and prefer authentic period detail and actors who resemble people from that period (not models).  That generally means those over 30 with some literary sophistication.  If you are under 30 and have not read Jane Austen, you will probably enjoy the Keira Knightley adaptation, which dummies down Jane Austen for the modern mass audience, features a cast that is prettier than talented, uses contemporary catch phrases and cliches, adds an element of sexuality not found in the novel, and completely misses the 19th century elegance of the landed gentry (pigs in the parlor, chickens on the front stoop? -- really!).  If you really want this travesty, I'll send you my copy for the price of postage.  Or better yet, read the novel -- and discover the difference between Hollywood melodrama and classic literature.	2.0	Not Jane Austen's P&P	2014-07-01	0	0	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A10AHXK1TYQROA	i heart books	"Ok, so here's the deal.  This movie is not completely true to the book.  If you are looking for that, I do suggest A&E's version.  However, this movie I don't think could have been totally faithful without also being 5 hours long, which is impossible for a theatrical release.  Also, many people have issues with the costumes, because they are not the traditional Regency clothes...but, this movie was set in the time that Jane Austen actually wrote Pride and Prejudice...not the years later when it was finally published, and certain characters are in fact in the true regency clothing such as Caroline Bingley to show how ""en vogue"" she is.  And yes, Elizabeth Bennet wears no bonnet and Aunt Catherine visits in the dead of night and not in the garden...but come on!  The same essential story is being told.  And of course the book is better, I should hope so.  If you want a bad version of Pride and Prejudice than look no further than the celebrated 1940 version starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier.  Not only do they change events from the book for no other reason than to make it more ""Hollywood"" (not, in fact, to consolidate a lengthy tale into a reasonable viewing time) but they also seem to change the time period to about 70 years later...to the late 1800's so that they could re-use Gone With the Wind costumes.  I am obsessed with Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and have read all of her books repeatedly and I still love this movie, although I admit there are some things that they changed that were not just simply for time sake...such as Mrs. Bennet being made to be a much more tolerable character in the movie  and also the esteem of her husband, which in the book is not so favorable...but other than that I think it is one of the best remakes made for theatrical release.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A24I3BMB9JZC7O	"Ingrid Heyn ""No man is an Iland, intire of it..."	"There is no denying that turning a book as rich in characterisation and plot as ""Pride and Prejudice"" into a film is a dicey proposition. It's no potboiler with forgettable dialogue. Its characters are not two-dimensional. The story threads interweave and there is delicious wit and rather wicked social commentary from the pen of Jane Austen. How can a film adaptation hope to capture all of that?Of course, it cannot.But need a film adaptation transgress as heinously and thoroughly as this one does against the intentions of the author?There were some inexplicable blunders that don't make sense at all: Darcy actually CAME INTO ELIZABETH BENNET'S BEDROOM to give her the letter he wrote (inexcusable blunder - this is simply inconceivable); the Bennet dining room had servants serving the food in far too small a room (English country houses do not have dining rooms of such miniature dimensions, and certainly a normal meal rather than a grand occasion for a family of the straitened circumstances the film attempts to portray would not include servants standing at the ready to serve. It seems as though the director has melded the serving practises of larger country houses with the idea of a poorer yet still genteel family, but that is entirely historically inaccurate); Darcy was wandering about with his shirt undone and no cravat (as sexy-looking as that is, it's so inauthentic as to constitute an unforgivable faux pas); the ball held by Bingley had far too many people to constitute a country ball held to get to know his neighbours (again, it seems the director is going by vaguely and inaccurately held ideas of English country habits - could some real research not have been done?); the entire embarrassing and ridiculous scene with Elizabeth Bennet lasciviously viewing and caressing naked statues could only strike a 20th or 21st century American audience as appropriate; and Darcy proposing in the rain... (as anachronistic as a watch on the wrist of Michelangel's David); and an utterly bewildering moment occurs when Lady Catherine de Bourgh arrives at the Bennet's house in the middle of the night. Unless she came with urgent news, she would have been neither heard nor admitted at such an hour, nor would a gentleman have dreamed of appearing in front of a lady in his nightclothes. Those are only some of the ill-conceived and inappropriate moments.Let us pass over the strange family dynamics - clearly neither the director nor the actors bothered to read the novel in order to discover the complex relationships involved. For one thing, Mr and Mrs Bennet's marital relationship was clearly written by Jane Austen to be the worst mismatch in history; Mr Bennet is intended to be so disgusted and bored by most of his family (wife and daughters, except for Elizabeth and Jane) that he can find refuge only in perceiving them as amusing, and hiding in his study to avoid having to deal with them.Let us pass then to the casting. Keira Knightley is a lovely-looking young actress, but the character of Elizabeth Bennet is beyond her. She does not have the complexity to understand such a character, and her acting skills are not at present sufficient to convey the depth of such a richly drawn character. However, for the purpose of this film, the characters are completely altered anyway. In terms, then, of this film, within its confines (and not in respect of Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet), Ms Knightley was perfectly adequate, although she looked odd at times. Partly this is because her thinness was highlighted rather than flattered, and partly it's because her hair was so very strangely arranged. I could not understand the ""washerwoman"" hairdo, I confess - it is historically inappropriate for the period. If the purpose was to make Elizabeth Bennet look less beautiful than Jane Bennet, a very strange idea has occurred. Elizabeth is certainly not plain in the novel. She has a loveliness that is characterised more by her liveliness than feature-by-feature, but she is considered by all who know her to be one of the prettiest girls in the county. Jane is considered by the regularity of her features to be the most beautiful, but the whole Bennet family is known for their beauty (save for Mary). How has this been translated to mean that Elizabeth is not lovely-looking? Why the insistence in this film on downplaying Keira Knightley's looks? Simply because Mr Darcy does not instantly find Elizabeth Bennet beautiful...? And because Miss Caroline Bingley and her sister will not do justice to her looks? The difference between Elizabeth and Jane is one of kind, not of quantity. Both the director and some of the viewers seem not to have realised that.The Darcy looked beautiful, and it's not really the actor's fault that he was not conveying Jane Austen's Darcy. Again, really I blame the scriptwriter who did such an appalling hatchet job, and the director who seems to have thought of this film in terms of making the cinematography look beautiful but eschewed any care with regard to historical detail or the requirements of the story itself.The dialogue flip-flops from modern ""I'm writing an historical novel"" style to authentic Jane Austen - and the difference between the two styles is embarrassing. Unless a scriptwriter is prepared to enmesh him/herself into the writing style of the period, complete with an understanding of the grammar of the English language as spoken at the time, and specifically the style employed by Jane Austen, such an obvious clash is bound to occur. And furthermore, a modern idea of dialogue can only create further flaws in the style of the dialogue. It simply doesn't work unless the scriptwriter is prepared to let go of a 21st century idea of how the characters OUGHT to be. If he/she isn't prepared to do that, the scriptwriter had better stick to modern dramas.What a pity that the scriptwriter felt it necessary to make Darcy ""misunderstood"" rather than truly ""proud"". This reduces the title of the book (and thus the title of the film) to meaningless drivel. In the novel, Darcy really WAS a proud man - he acknowledges it, and through his love for Elizabeth and the travails in their relationship, he found within himself a more proper understanding of how he could maintain his sense of self yet become more approachable. Elizabeth, too, acknowleged in the novel that her prejudices led her astray, and she, through knowing Darcy and through the troubles of her own family, comes to learn herself more thoroughly. ""Until this moment I never knew myself"", she says - but she does not say it in the film. Indeed, she could not - for in the film, she too is just ""misunderstood"". The characters do not grow and develop in this film - because, like a Mills & Boon romance novel, they don't need to. The characters are two-dimensional - but most viewers don't seem to notice that.To compare this film to the splendid 6-part adaptation with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth is to compare a somewhat battered meringue with a superb full-sized gateau. The BBC series had everything right; this film sadly does not.I suppose the main flaw of this film was its obviousness. Moments such as ""sexy open-shirted man strides through the mist, his cloak flapping in the wind behind him"" abound. Oh dear. Very, very Mills-and-Boonish. The lack of subtlety is everywhere... and the same holds true for the character dynamics. Instead of the subtle 18th century character interplay, the audience is served with lashings of modernised ideas of love sans any of the biting social judgements that add spice to Jane Austen's excellent writing.By the end of this film (indeed, fifteen minutes into the film), I no longer cared whether Darcy and Elizabeth ever married. I could not consider them real. They had no claim upon my sympathy. What a contrast to my emotional involvement in the BBC series!I recommend this only for viewers who enjoy soap operas, or for people who don't care about historical accuracy or subtle performances.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AWWY9NSLKEU05	J.A Fan	"I admit it.  I'm totally biased to the BBC miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as well.  But I've also read the book enough times (more than 20 times over less than 10 years) to feel this version of Jane Austen's book is a terrible reflection of her work.  I felt the casting of almost everyone in the movie was completely wrong - something that perhaps might not have appeared so bad if the actors in question had bothered to read the book themselves to know how they should be portraying their part.Matthew MacFadyen was rather unlikeable - he spent the entire time sneering at everyone and everything and by the end of the movie, one was left wondering how on earth Elizabeth decided he was a nice person.  Apart from the one scene between Elizabeth and Darcy where he proposes to her the first time, there was absolutely no chemistry between them whatsoever.  Keira played Elizabeth kind of OK, but her speedy change from hate of Darcy to love was just bizarre.  I'm not a big fan of Keira's anyway, and I felt that she was very wrong for the part.  And Mr Bingley, who was portrayed as a kind of moron... I was horrified.All relationships that were so well defined in the novel were completely underdone in this movie version; the story did not flow at all well.  It's like the writers closed their eyes, flicked through the book, and randomly pointed their finger at a page to decide the storyline.  As someone who has read the book so many times, at least I knew what happened in the ""missing"" sections of the movie so my mind could make sense of what it WASN'T seeing - I can't imagine anyone who has never read the book would understand why Elizabeth and Darcy got together in the end.  They had very few scenes together and again, no chemistry at all.At the end of the day, one must consider that this IS a Hollywood flick after all - you can't expect much from them and have to take it all with a grain of salt. As a big Austen fan, it was a hard thing to do with this movie (as it was with Gwyneth Paltrow's ""Emma"").  As a relatively entertaining flick, I give it the thumbs up - while Pride and Prejudice is my favourite Austen novel and this version is... well, terrible... I'm always a sucker for a romantic film!!  As a good adaptation of Jane Austen's novel however, I give it two big thumbs down.If you're into light entertainment - buy it.  If you're a hardcore Austen fan expecting anything even remotely as breathtakingly awesome as the BBC Firth/Ehle version - stay well away from this one!"	2.0	Not as good as it could have been...	2006-03-10	25	11	14

I also own this movie on DVD, but decided to upgrade when the blu ray went on sale.  All I can say is I am glad I did not pay any more for the blu ray.  The title menu is a disaster.  The graphics and sound effects annoyingly remind one of powerpoint templates.  Who wants to feel like they are in the middle of a conference when watching a movie?  Whoever orchestrated the menu is not an artist, which stands in obvious contrast with the film. I would recommend waiting for the next blu ray release, if you are simply upgrading from DVD to blu ray.  Yes, the menu is that annoying!!!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A21AWXE9C5IO1Y	James D. ODell	Would Jane Austen approve of this use of her book?  Ask a silly question.  In the protracted pre-dawn of the audio-visual age that we call the nineteenth century, literature, as in our day, could be conceived as a means of making people think, but never could it guarantee where thoughts might wander.  The whole idea was to set thoughts in motion, to stir the imagination into creating self-styled images that reflected the author's words as readers experienced them.  A do-it-yourself motion picture.I think that Jane Austen would find our reflections every bit as entertaining as her own.  As ever, the character of human nature is timeless, much as we delightin exploring the nature of her characters, and have done for generations, beyond anything that she could have anticipated.I am impressed with this film at all levels.  The cinematography is outstanding, and beautifully understated, as is the acting.  Historically, it is as true to the period as anything I've seen.  It's also a product of its own time, and the pace runs accordingly.  Parts of the original book are suggested more than played outon screen.  Still, there is something to be said for brevity in telling a story, especially if it's a good one.	5.0	Pure Entertainment, As Ever Was	2011-02-01	4	3	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AL5OEDM8TPTKV	James Hiller	Is it possible for a film to get better and better with repeated viewings? I originially caught Pride and Prejudice in the theaters when released, and was surprisingly delighted at the adaptation presented before me. Then, I promptly forgot it with the Caoptes and Brokeback Mountains of the world. Upon it's release on DVD, I absolutely fell in love with this movie, and again and again, and now regard it as a mere masterpiece; a cinematic feast.I'm not an Austen purest. In fact, I shudder to admit on Amazon.com that I have not even read her. So any comparison of the book to the movie would be lost on me. I also have not witnessed the BBC comprehensive version of Pride, to which many compare this movie. So the disruptive ending of the movie, which sometimes seems to upset the Austen purests, and the wonderful performance of Colin Firth, which dominates the BBC version, are unknown to me. I watch this with virgin eyes.And of course, I delight in what I see. A story of a young woman, one of four girls, destined in early 1800's England to marry, but with strong will and mind of her own. She bristles against the bristle-y Mr. Darcy, hard edged, unsocial (much like me, minus the money), and like flint and steel, tremendously spark and start a fire which burns through the film, brightly, intensely, passionately. The moments of confrontation, and lack thereof, between Elizabeth and Darcy are juicy, palpable, and true, and thus drive this plot honestly.The performances astound. I've caught all of the leading actress roles this year, and I must say, Kiera Knightly's performance ranks as superior. She is the film; simply put. Should another actress play Elizabeth, the film would have lost its soulforce. By all rights, she should have marched up to the stage to claim her reward (possibly only surpassed by the comparable Felicity Huffman's role in Transamerica). In turn, Matthew Macfadyen's harsh Mr. Darcy melts before our eyes and on the screen before Elizabeth, and the glacial melt is amazing. Where was his nomination? Supporting actors Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn were born to play Elizabeth's honest, supportive parents. And Tom Hollander as the bumbling, ill-fated suitor Mr. Collins almost steals the movie with his comic pathos. Fine performances from all.Adding to this mix, Joe Wright's amazing, amazing, amazing direction. Most of the film's enjoyment comes from his camera placement and work. Just watch the scene at the second party, where the camera moves throughout the party, and manages to tell several parts of the story seemlessly at once. Wright tells on the commentary how it took hours to set up the shot; the results impress and delight. He shaped this movie, which could have been another bland period piece, into something rich, delightful, multi-layered, and dare I say.... modern?Pride and Prejudice is a film that in many years, people will be popping into their video players of the future; to study fine filmmaking, to learn from solid performances, to watch young love, and to enjoy the exploits of Elizabeth and Darcy, their machinations of love, and the persistance of desire.Bravo!	5.0	Better and Better	2006-03-18	37	29	8

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A17JVI15BRY90P	James T. Wheeler	"1. This movie is much better than my wife and I expected.  To be sure, there are big departures from Jane Austen's book and the tale seems tailored to a modern audience.  Nevertheless, we're giving this production five stars, because of its overall impact and flow.  The acting and location shots are first-rate and key scenes are so beautifully done.  We particularly liked the scene near the end where Elizabeth entreats her father so she might marry Mr. Darcy.  She reveals how Darcy is the one who bailed out the Bennett family from Mr. Wickham's debts and also arranged for sister Lydia's marriage. This ending seems more convincing than other versions we've seen because it registers with Mr. Bennett that Darcy is the one who saved the family.  If you look it up, the bail-out revelation is in the book.2. Viewers may want to turn on English subtitles in places so as to get all the dialogue.  This is a British production making it hard for we Americans to follow at times.  An idea raised by another reviewer is also a good one, namely, to turn on the director's commentary when you have time to re-view the movie.  A lot of things come out you would not know otherwise, making this a deeper film than what you first saw.  Not all the director's comments are profound but when he tells you he devoted 2 years of his life to the film (morning, noon, and night) you need to pay attention.  Also, we're told why Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle are given a tour of sculptures at Pemberley rather than seeing portraits of the Darcy family.  Sure, the scene departs from the book, as so many other things do, but it's awfully well done.3. This movie runs only 2 hours, so its character development pales in comparison with miniseries that were done by the BBC in 1979 and by A&E; in 1995.  On DVD, these productions run 4 and 5 hours, respectively.  To really understand the story line most viewers should see one or both of these and even read the book.  Key characters like Wickham and Mr. & Mrs. Collins barely have cameo roles in the 2005 movie which is a pity.  Also, time constraints may have precluded showing more on the special relationship between Mr. Bennett and his second daughter, Elizabeth, who may really be his alter ego.4. In other respects, it's apparent that the producer and director wanted to stage this movie a lot differently than previous versions.  The Bennett family is seen living a very rustic life with pigs, geese, and dogs underfoot.  This is a major departure from life discussed in the book and depicted in other film and TV versions.  This movie is set in the year, 1797, not 1813, as previously understood.  In another departure, the opening ballroom scene is far more informal and earthy than what we've seen before. But it has an infectious energy that prepares you for the rest of the show.  Yes, this version is going to be different from other ones!5. For most of the movie, Elizabeth runs around in very casual attire with her hair wild and unkempt.  All the while she states her opinions freely and is not bashful about offending others, including her poor mother.  In many ways, Lizzy seems like a wild animal that may appeal to Darcy's basic instincts. This is another big departure from the book and from past productions where the eldest Bennett girls are seen as well-dressed and presentable, desperate as they are to find good husbands.  The ""car wreck"" scene where Elizabeth rejects Darcy and his first marriage proposal may be the most powerful moment in the movie.  Darcy, despite his imposing size and presence, appears lucky Elizabeth didn't have a club nearby when she rejected him.  What a contrast to the second proposal where Darcy stammers out his love for her and Elizabeth accepts him while gently taking his hand.  Brilliantly done!6. Music has been an important element in past productions of Pride and Prejudice and it is here, as well.  The Baroque-era music played at the balls is our favorite kind.  Also, the haunting piano theme heard throughout the show is extremely well done and played.  Bravo!7. Although the casting of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett may have raised some eyebrows we thought he did quite well, especially at the end where he talks to Elizabeth about Darcy's second proposal.  Keira Knightley is marvelous as the untamed Elizabeth, Mr. Bennett's favorite daughter.  Matthew MacFadyen is a revelation as Darcy.  In truth, Matthew looks like such a physical specimen he might have playing linebacker for the Green Bay Packers.  What's just as amazing is that when he speaks he sounds like an educated, British gentleman.  Actors portraying Mrs. Bennett, Jane Bennett, Mr. & Mrs. Collins, Lady Catherine DeBourgh, Mr. & Miss Bingley, and the other Bennett sisters were fine, too.  Mr. Bingley did seem a bit foppish at times, but in contrast to MacFadyen's Darcy, it's not surprising.8. At the end, Elizabeth seems to blame herself completely for misjudging Darcy.  He comes off then as pride-free and irresistible.  Some might feel this is taking one too many liberties with Jane Austen's message.  Actually, Darcy has been changed and humbled by Elizabeth's rejection of his first proposal.  It takes several months for a transformation to be completed and for Darcy to do heroic deeds.  He then becomes acceptable to her and us.  The movie's producer and director may have been aware of this fact but with only 2 hours to work with simply couldn't show it.  Or, maybe they just wanted to stress that rich people have their problems, too?9. Comparisons to the other versions of Pride and Prejudice are difficult.  For us, the wit and elegance of the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version from 1995, may never be surpassed.  Also, the 1979 miniseries with Elizabeth Garvie, David Rintoul, and Judy Parfitt has special moments.  The 1940 version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier deserves attention as well, even though it takes even more liberties with Jane Austen's story than the others.  In style and substance, the 2005 version is quite different from earlier ones but it is effective and entertaining.  Our sense is to get and study them all.  The timeless story and characters make for a masterpiece in English literature and a study of human nature.  If nothing else, the happy ending of the 2005 version is classic.10. Special features on the 2005, DVD include interviews with the producer, the director, and the main characters.  There is some repetition, but their comments offer more insights into why this story is so appealing. Too bad other productions haven't offered interviews of the leading stars in this way.  Maybe we'll see them some day in a super-gold, Nth anniversary, collectors' edition?"	5.0	Not the 1995 version, but still very well done	2006-10-16	21	16	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A43DABSC1U30Y	Jamie Ballenger	The parts are greater than the whole with this film. Heaps of fun, a young tone as if Miss Marianne Dashwood had read the novel and dreamt over it. I appreciated the late 18th century setting, and the rustic genteel poverty of the Bennett family. Putting Mr Bennett and Eliza under a sharper light, and Darcy under a softer one was also appreciated. Everyone else were treated like people, and not caricatures. M McFayden's every movement and gesture, every flinch and flicker across his face tells us about Darcy's striving rationality, and its shift towards Elizabeth's person. K Knightly's radiance plays Eliza Bennett's nascent rationality; womanly and in danger of being deformed by her father's sardonic view of life and people, and stunted by her mother's limited views, with the air of an over ripe snarky middle schooler who is brought to adulthood by real love. The rest of the cast is superb, and supports the couple's story wonderfully. The scrambled, and sometime garbled text is annoying, and Knightly's tendency towards model face can be distracting. Very enjoyable dancing and dining scenes as per Austen. Pax,jb.	4.0	Parts greater than the whole?	2013-10-07	1	1	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1ZMNARCR1DS18	"Jamie Stewart ""Mrs. Stewart"""	I am not giving this film two stars because it is a terrible movie, but rather for its lack of devotion towards the novel.  I am a lover of the BBC version and book, not only because its well-acted but thoroughly sticks to the story.  In this film,The language and monologues are so altered, and I'm afraid to admit that this is a result of our lack of appreciation for the old english language, and a yearning for a less intricate way of speaking.  It's as if our generation needs subtitles for our own language! And This is coming from a youth. In this new version of Pride and Prejudice I couldn't help but be diverted from the manner in which Kiera Knighlty delivers her lines.  That's the thing...they are just lines.  Not only are they rushed, but lack any substance that would induce me to love her as a character.  Elizabeth Bennet is supposed to be bold, smart, witty, and admirable.  Kiera Knightly sort of betrays her as a girl who can't hold her tongue. I surmise that is why i was surprised to see how Darcy falls in love with her so quickly.  Don't get me wrong, there are some good elements that this movie has to offer.  The scenery and music are exquisite, in fact I believe that these two very things tell the story more the actors do, and that's swell.  This movie is loved by everyone, understandably so, because it gives a more romantic approach.  I have to admit, it is appealing, and beautiful to watch, but it is not Austin.	2.0	A Classic Novel Turned into a Contemporary CROWD Pleaser	2006-08-11	20	13	7

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ADQH0WXNLPBK	Jan Barbour (English & social studies teacher...	Being an annual reader of Pride and Prejudice and a lover of Jane Austen's humor and insight, I found this film to be at best disappointing. Austen's humor was lost in translation to say the least. Elizabeth Bennet was morphed into a dreamy eyed, slightly naughty, tousled haired temptress. Her father, Mr. Bennet, was, despite the acting talents of Donald Sutherland, transformed into a frousled, woolly, bumbling father who simply didn't know how to be a parent. All that aside, the photography is lovely, the costumes are beautiful, and the soundtrack is delightful, but this simply isn't Jane Austen. For a proper film version of this wonderful book try the A&E version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle or the BBC. The A&E version may six one-hour episodes, but, with minor alterations, it's magnificently produced, witty, beautifully acted, and absolutely true to the book and entirely in keeping with Austen's writing.	2.0	Very Pretty -- but Disappointing	2008-08-29	12	7	5

This version of the Jane Austen classic gives such a fresh view of the story and the music was so lovely and enchanting. This film was the first time I ever heard of Jane Austen. I loved it so much, I became a fan of all of Jane Austen's stories. I can absolutlely say this is my favorite movie of all. It's such a deeply moving love story and I like how it reflects a lot of the things we feel in real life. This film was so visually and audibly beautiful and I never get tired of watching it. The colors, the lighting, the costumes, and the English countryside were lovely. I highly recommend it. It's clean and yet deals with a very adult issue: never judge your true love by his or her cover.	5.0	Gorgeous Film!	2009-12-18	4	3	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A257ZZQPI463DY	Jane Austen	I first read P&P in college and some years later was thrilled to see the wonderful adaptation starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  It was so good and followed the book so well that I wondered what was the purpose of remaking this story and in such an inferior way. I do not believe that I am being nitpicking when I say that at the time of the story, women would never have been seen with such messy hair and clothing.  Even the poorer class ones (which the Bennets most certainly were NOT) would never have lived and dressed the way they are depicted in this ridiculous film.  Pigs in the yard and such dirty surroundings!  Really!  It looked more like Tobacco Road than the home of British gentry!  The characters also were badly interpreted especially Mr. Bingley who was a real wuss and one wonders what did Jane see in him besides his money.  Did screen writers or director even crack the book? They certainly did not study the history and social customs of the time.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A96AUNSF6GESO	Janeite	"Okay, I'm a total Janeite who adores Austen and all her work. I probably re-read each of her novels at least once a year, and I'm a high school English teacher. So I find the 1995 BBC mini-series to be the Holy Grail of Austen movies. But this one has its charms. I am not a big Keira Knightley fan, and I found her Lizzy to be less spunky and more moody than in the novel. (The director keeps showing Lizzy alone, staring into space. I suppose that should make us think she's deep.She's much more cheerful and sociable in the book.) Also the director went for a ""grubby"" look in this movie. Everybody has greasy hair and appears to need a shower. I guess he figures nobody bathed much in those days. The story is a bare bones version of the book that hits the high points quickly, but the movie is clearly more interested in being beautiful and poetic, and there it succeeds. The piano music in this film is lyrical and moving, and the movie has lots of interesting visual images. The director does a nifty thing with the characters' hands that I really liked. And this Darcy (while no Colin Firth) is not too shabby. Matthew Macfadyen seems to be portraying a ""kinder, gentler"" Darcy who seems more shy that gruff, but he's such a handsome guy and has such a gorgeous, deep voice, that I enjoyed looking at him and listening to him. So my overall impression is that I liked it for what it was, a quicker more stylized version of a wonderful story. As a footnote, I'll add that my students fall into two camps when I show them this movie: girls who fall in love with Darcy and adore the film, and kids of both genders who say they hated it because the story moved so fast they couldn't tell what was happening."	4.0	Lovely but not that true to the novel	2009-02-03	5	4	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A25L0XHPXNU3JA	Jane Shafer	I am a huge fan of Jane Austen. I also read numerous books on Regency/Historical and Scottish Historical Romance. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are featured by many authors in sequels to Pride and Prejudice of which have given many insights to what different could have been a possible future for them if Ms. Austen had had a longer life to write such sequels herself.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AXGAJ8L22PEYB	"Janet E Willson ""jazzlady53"""	This was a fantastic movie that I have seen over and over again. This version of Pride and Prejudice is on my list of the best movies I have ever seen.  Even my 15 year old son liked this movie! Pride and Prejudice is a period romance set in the 1700's in England. You will see incredible houses, beautiful scenery, and the sights and sounds as they may have been witnessed in the 1700's.  The acting by Kiera Knightley as Elizabeth Bennett and Matthew MacFayden as Mr. Darcy is awesome.  The supporting cast does a fantastic job of carrying the story line too.  I already have this version of Pride and Prejudice on DVD as well as the music CD from the movie.

Her quirks and mannerism's all seem to scream ""Look at me! Look at me!"" in almost a Lydia like fashion, pardon the pun. The Darcy in this one was good, loved his eyes, but I just couldn't get past Knightley. There were redeeming qualities about this though. Donald Sutherland as her father was excellent and I especially enjoyed the final scene between he and his daughter when he's asking her if she really likes Darcy. He tears up and it's entirely believable. I did not like the scene at the end when Darcy and Lizzie finally declare their love for each other. Instead of answering, in this version, Knightly takes his hand and kisses it. I'm very much convinced, after reading several Jane Austen's and books during this era, that this would not have happened. There is just too much propriety here during this age for that. Took me out of the story, and because of it, can't recommend it.[...]"	2.0	This Movie is Only for Knightly Fans...	2012-04-19	8	5	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1Y71YV0PDWZ9L	"Jasmine ""Crimson Joy"""	We swore not to compare it to the BBC miniseries. You can't improve on perfection. So, after hearing the rave reviews, we decided to throw caution to the wind and watch it, after swearing never, not once, to compare between the two.All in all, it wasn't a bad movie. The main problem lies in the confusing storyline which simply cannot be covered in such a short time. If I hadn't such an intimate knowledge of P&P; before the movie, I would have been quite lost. This affects character developement and relationships. There are moments of quiet and pretty music but very little interaction between Elizabeth and Darcy.The feel of old-England society was lost, which leads to a lot of confusion. Why is it so terrible that Darcy won't dance with Elizabeth? Why are her sisters such an embarrasment when the parties they are in are as raucus as themselves? Being familiar with the book, I already knew, but the impact of the embarassing and moving moments were lost because the society that made them embarassing and moving were gone. Also, Elizabeth going out into the rain to get herself a towel off the line? *shakes head* The Bennets are not poor; they happen to be quite well-to-do, the only thing they don't have is dowries for the girls. You can have a huge income and not any money saved up. And admiring nude statues in Darcy's home? Uhh.. that's not right.The society portrayed in this movie was not the stuffy, prissy life of the upper-middle class, but more suited to the lower. Perhaps they meant to liven it up a bit by showing us the nitty-gritty side to life, but instead they spoiled the feeling of the whole society. Elizabeth and Jane giggling in bed? I don't know.. that's just not.. English.Keira Knightly is not a bad Elizabeth Bennet. She did justice to the role. Darcy talked to fast and was more quiet and laid back than arrogant and imposing. Also, he wasn't good-looking at all. Part of his personna is his hot animal attraction! Wickham was not only very likeable but gorgeous! That's not right! Darcy should be more cute! (Ok, enough juvenile complaints) Mr.Collins was.. not stupid. He was almost.. conniving. And handsome, too, if short. I really couldn't understand why Elizabeth could object so strongly to marry him especially considering her family's condition. It seemed.. selfish of her. Again, this is only looking at the movie as though I had never read the book before.THe movie was pretty, with beautiful music and nice acting. It had its good parts and carried the essence of the story pretty well. However, it left much to be desired and the characters weren't Jane Austen's own. I would have to recommend the BBC version.. the book there is played to perfection. But this is a good movie for your weekends as well.	3.0	Meh.. nothing spectacular.. beautiful music, though..	2006-05-15	21	11	10

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2JSQCBXKZNNJO	Jason Baker	"I still consider the 1995 miniseries to be THE definitive version of Pride & Prejudice.Still, this new version does have things about it I prefer to any other version. Donald Sutherland in this version I find to be the best Mr. Bennet of all versions.No matter what version you watch, you hear Mrs. Bennet repeatedly comment on how much prettier Jane is than Lizzy. In the '95 version Lizzy is 10 times prettier than Jane and therefore Mrs. Bennet's comments just make you scratch your head and say ""what!?"". The Jane in the new version is such a beauty that you can accept these comments even though you may not agree with them. The Jane in this version is also more fitting in age. The Jane in the '95 version seems to old for the part, even though Susannah Harker acted the part with perfection.I like the new Wickham a bit better too since in the new one he is much more handsome. Someone could indeed picture Lizzy choosing him over Darcy for looks alone and therefore could indeed be considered a threat. The Wickham in the '95 version isn't nearly as good-looking as Mr. Darcy and therefore less of a threat.As far as Mr. Bingley goes, I loved both the new and old '95 versions of him. Unlike most people I like the new Mr. Bingley better. He is more shy and timid in the new version and this to me makes him more endearingAs far as comparing the 2 Lizzies, I think that Keira Knightley is every bit as a talented actress as Jennifer Ehle is in the '95 version. With that said every now and then an actor or actress comes along who was born to play a part. As much as Keanu Reeves isn't the best actor out there , he was born to play the part of Neo in The Matrix. Nobody could have done it better. I feel the same way about Jennifer Ehle in the mini series. While Miss Knightley is just as talented and did a great job in the remake, Jennifer Ehle was simply born for this part and truly embodies Lizzy. I don't think anyone could have done a better job than her.The same goes for Colin Firth as Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. While Matthew Macfadyen did a WONDERFUL job in the remake, Colin Firth was simply born the part. He IS Darcy.All-in-all as a whole there is no version that can compare to the '95 mini series, which is truly a masterpiece. Still, the new version is well worth buying and offers a refreshing take on this story. I would even go as far as saying that the new version is my favorite movie of the year !I rate the '95 version 10 stars out of 10 , and this new version 9 stars out of 10. Buy them both!"	5.0	Best Movie Of The Year !	2006-03-07	18	10	8

Though very different from the beloved miniseries, this is a powerful blend of cinematography, a lovely story, strong characters and beautiful music. Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet has got to be my favorite of his roles ever. I love Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet; and Tom Hollander is suitably annoying as Mr. Collins. Kelly Reilly is almost snakelike as Caroline Bingley. Of course, the two principle characters are very good. Keira Knightley is saucy, and I love the scenes with Judi Dench. Matthew Macfadyen is a haughty and yummy, Mr. Darcy.	5.0	A Romantic & Real Story	2013-11-28	0	0	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1ESQJBMB1GOGV	"Jaynee ""jaynee"""	After 310 reviews already posted here, I doubt you want one more.  But as an avid A&E; miniseries P&P; fan I felt I needed to add my own positive review about this brisk adaptation.  The pacing was certainly quick (when Charlotte announced that she was marrying Collins after only 30 minutes I knew this was going to be a quicker ride than I was used to!), but the writers kept all the highlights and were able to piece together a refreshing version.  It's kind of like the Cliff's Notes version for those that want a quick taste of Austen without having to settle in for the 6-hour Firth/Ehle miniseries.A quick note about MacFadyen, portraying Darcy.  I was prepared to dislike him entirely as Darcy, given my propensity for Firth's portrayal.  However, I discovered that my two favorite scenes in this version were the very two scenes that are the most important to the Darcy/Lizzy relationship:  His first declaration of love and eventual insult of her family followed by his second declaration in the meadow.  In both of those scenes MacFadyen was brilliant and I much preferred his awkward announcements over Colin Firth's brashness (sacrilege for most, I know).Very well done!	4.0	A pleasing adaption	2006-04-25	20	14	6
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AQ33BY314SU13	Jazztique	"Many may find my review ""prejudiced"" due to my being an avid fan of the book, the 1939 version and the BBC 1995 version - but I urge you to carefully consider the reasons for my EXTREMELY LOW opinion of the 2005 production below:1. I call it a ""production"" rather than an ""adaptation"" because this movie in no way resembles the spirit, the cleverness, nor the principle of the book. Jane Austen wrote a story based on the social conventions of her day and interlaced her descriptions of the setting, the characters and their behaviors with the amused observations of a woman who sharply recognizes the dynamics of human interaction shrouded behind the cloak of manners. This book, in fact, is described as being a masterful ""comedy of manners"", and is celebrated as such along with all Jane Austen works. Pride and Prejudice (the book) is a triumphant social commentary of what lies beneath the manners of upper and middle class English people - the comedic, the sweet, the nasty, the ambitious, the heart-broken...and the passionate. This production took liberties with the time period (changing it from late 19th century to the late 18th century), thereby taking Austen's nuanced observations of social mores during her time completely out of the equation. Then, to add insult to injury, the film makers did not bother to make any commentary of their own regarding the social dynamics of that time. With this, they completely broke the spirit of the book.2. Elizabeth Bennett as a character in the book represents the intelligence, the spirit and the liveliness of Jane Austen herself during her time. Many of the witty observations of the character were completely lost in translation within the 2005 production. Keira Knightly did a fine job at playing the character she was given, but this Elizabeth Bennett is decidedly NOT the beloved character that was so finely crafted by its original author. I wouldn't be surprised if the actress eventually admits to playing this version with a heavy heart (not to mention Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland, Jena Malone and Judi Dench - if they, as any truly literary person, read the original story, they would be scandalized with this production's one-note view of their characters as well).3. The dialogue was atrociously tampered with within this production. Much of the important, clever, witty and profound dialogue found within the book was ruthlessly cut in favor of the film makers desire to present sweeping landscapes of the pristine English countryside. Is this the commentary that they longed to make in this film? That the cinematography (along with the swells of music as the stags ran by) is even more beautiful and more noteworthy than the characters themselves?!!! If I took the time to count the frames of film that were allocated towards such non-consequential footage, I'm sure I'd find that a good 70% of the movie was spent staring at the sun over a mountainside. Capital offense! Then, the film makers presumed to add their own dialogue - and it was an inept attempt at that. The dialogue added was flat, simple and inartistic - designed to ""spell out"" the unfolding of the story's events. This was a clear indication of the film makers lack of confidence in the literary sensibilities of today's moviegoers - instead of presenting a witty, masterful and intelligent version we can all get behind, they delivered a watered-down, dreary version that is pumped full of romantic, visual imagery.4. This production, quite simply, dishonors the spirit of Jane Austen. The film makers had no intention of honoring, or celebrating the brilliance of this author's work - instead they sought to exploit it to pack as many Austen fans (through the shameless promotion of this film as being an ""adaptation"") and Keira Knightly fans into the theaters as possible. They repackaged the original story as a sweeping romantic drama in a veiled attempt to capitalize on the ""Titanic"" angle, and put their own ""youthful"" spin on a classic by making the characters exhibit attitudes and behaviors that are more like the young people of today. Rather than mannerly and dignified, the youthful characters in this production are sullen, caustic, petulant and self-absorbed. There was absolutely no room for subtlety when conveying their thoughts, opinions and emotions. Yet another unforgivable digression from the classic Austen version.I could go on and on about the dissatisfaction with this 2005 production, but I think the points made above will do. Those who truly want to learn more about the fantastic story upon which this production is supposedly based, I recommend reading the reviews of the Jane Austen book and eventually, when time allows, reading the book itself. And as far as a film adaptation goes, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the BBC production - one that truly honors Jane Austen and is in keeping with the spirit of the book...and the spirit of the author."	1.0	The bastardization of a classic!	2006-03-25	56	34	22

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1ULMFI7GNVPZM	"J. Beins ""Diversity Encouraged"""	This is a very attractive film.  Attractive stars, attractive sets, attractive story.  As a period romance it is a fine and entertaining film.  But it is not Jane Austen.  In fact, if you weren't already well versed in the plot of Pride and Prejudice, I don't know that you'd get it from this film.  Austen wrote with an 18th century sensibility, not a Romantic Age one.  And although the film has an 18th c. setting feel - a bit of the country raunch of Tom Jones - it is not the setting Austen wrote. Her characters did not wallow in pig slop.  Most of her wit is swamped by misty morning ramblings of the young stars, caught in glowing close-ups - time better spent on the plot and dialogue.  Classic comic characters are given short shrift and played with far too much seriousness or sympathy.  The all important sub-plot, which explains the sisters dilemma, flashes by so fast that many may miss its significance, particularly in light of today's mores. But then adequate development might detract from the time needed for all those misty close-ups.  Knightley is attractive but this is NOT her Academy Award star turn - or rather, shouldn't have been.  If Austen doesn't matter to you, you'll enjoy the film.  If Austen does, stick with the BBC mini-series.	3.0	Pretty Is As Pretty Does	2006-09-12	13	6	7

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A145O1ERYZLGJ5	JD	This a terrible adaptation of an excellent book. I'm not denying that the movie is entertaining to watch, since it is. But it does no justice to the actual book. Granted, I'm comparing with A&E;'s brilliant adaptation, so it would be hard for any movie to stand up to that. Obviously, this is a shorter movie and necessarily cannot follow the book as closely, which I don't necessarily have a problem with. The real issue that I have with this movie is the incorrect portrayal of the characters, particularly that of Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Darcy looks like scruffy slob in much of the movie, which is ridiculous. The worst though is Mr. Bingley. His character is portrayed as stupid throughout the whole movie. While Mr. Bingley is certainly a bit goofy in the book, he is anything but stupid. Here though, the directors or whoever else have made him seem like a bumbling idiot. This is such a shallow interpretation of his character, as if he serves no other purpose in the story besides comedic value, which is preposterous.Realistically though, this movie was created purely for entertainment and they did do that. I guess I just love A&E;'s version too much to be satisfied with anything else :) But if you don't have 6+ hours to devote to watching all of that and just want to curl up on the couch and watch a good love story, this one works well :)	3.0	Entertaining, but a terrible adaptation	2011-02-02	8	5	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"Though beautifully shot and ably acted, there is too much story in ""Pride and Prejudice"" to fit into 2 hours. The film skimps on the relationship between Elizabeth and her father, and flattens the differences between the sisters until they are nearly indistinguishable. Mister Collins, the fusty pastor, is only marginally dull; fiendish Mr. Wickham seems incapable of guile; Lydia Bennet insufficiently silly. The movie gives us little background to appreciate the country-vs-city issues, such as why Darcy and Miss Bingley considered walking so bizarre a mode of transport. And not for a moment did I consider Keira Knightley as someone who could be taken as plain-looking.The sets are quite splendid, however. Even the Bennet's ""poor"" country manor, for all its faded and peeling glory, is rendered with great detail. The sountrack however, was so loud and lush and hardworking that it bordered on clich&eacute; -- when it wasn't actually masking important dialog. So much of the film is hurried, with machine-gun dialog that I could not understand. And compensatory touches -- like providing the characters with different outfits or outsized personalities -- were ignored for some reason, perhaps to focus more on the main characters. If so, this was a huge mistake. The charm of P&P; is the interplay between the book's many characters and the norms that governed them. To streamline the characters and plot is to take away the story's soul.And no amount of loud music can make up for that.I highly recommend the 1995 miniseries, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. It's more than twice as long as this movie, but has to be."	3.0	Unconvincing cram job	2006-01-23	22	12	10

Unlike the 1995 six part series on BBC which cover 90% of the story, I thought this newer version held it's own. The beauty of the scenery on location leaves you breathless.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ABII24PRIL2P8	Jean	Keira Knightley was a wonderful Elizabeth, a bit younger and more spirited than in some of the older beloved productions, and Matthew MacFadyen played Mr Darcy to perfection. Rosamund Pike as Jane and Simon Woods as Mr Bingley both exuded a sweet, innocent sort of romance that was exactly right for the characters. In fact, all of the casting was excellent, which made for an enjoyable transition from book to screen. The story has, of course, been truncated to a certain degree, but the trimming was skillfully done. The cinematography is gorgeous.

And although this remake had its flaws (acting, costuming, some details incorrect), there is one thing that this remake had that, in my opinion, BBC lacked - emotion.  By the end of the movie, I felt that these characters were in love, I felt that Jane was truly happy after her proposal.  I didn't feel any of that during the BBC version.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AL41S34H9CN2L	Jeffrey Lee	The earlier BBC version of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth has compelling characterizations, coherence, continuity, charm, sensitivity and moving music and visuals. This one lacks most of those qualities. With this newer Universal Studios remake, it's as if someone took a finished puzzle, pulled apart the pieces and threw them across the room, then tried randomly to put them back together. If I had watched this production without ever having seen the BBC's earlier one, I would have barely understood what was transpiring. Circumstances occur too rapidly, are never substantively developed, fall into an abyss and then are replaced by other events that demonstrate no depth or development either...My wife and I have viewed the BBC presentation many times, and each time we have experienced a wonderful sense of emotional fulfillment. We watched this Universal version just once---that was more than enough. The most satisfying thing was getting rid of the dvd as soon as possible.	1.0	Piecemeal and annoyingly superficial	2006-07-09	121	87	34
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2BC978GQQEA2A	Jeffrey Pidgeon	"The challenge of adapting any previous standing work is cited by screenwriters as notoriously difficult, perhaps the most so. It's especially encouraging, then, to see such a well-made, engaging translation to the big screen. It's no small feat, as for many Austenites (including my wife), the 1995 BBC-TV miniseries is the definitive one.While that version has six hours to gently unfold the romance of the quick-witted, independent Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) and the imperious, remote Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen), this new film only has two. It's a fine telescoping and shuffling of locales and events, nicely paced without feeling rushed. Both performers warm to each other in increments well-suited for the story's shape. It's believable, tender and touching.The casting choices are strong, but purists may find themselves longing for the BBC cast at times. Especially missed are Benjamin Whitrow's Mr. Bennett, and David Bamber's Mr. Collins. Mr. Whitrow's Bennett is a flinty delight, but Mr. Sutherland's final scene is so warm and emotional that it rescues his far softer interpretation. Tom Hollander's Mr. Collins suffers the most in comparison with his predecessor, whose hilarious take on the character bordered on the reptilian. Of course, Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy is in no danger of being eclipsed, but Mr. MacFadyen more than holds his own with a subtly rendered performance. Ms. Knightley defies the ""pretty girl"" casting with very strong acting as well, proving herself to be convincing in a period drama.This is a great stand-alone version of the story, drawing viewers in and engaging their hearts and minds. While the miniseries is ultimately superior, this new film also preserves the story's charms through a new lens."	3.0	Taste and Adaptation	2006-04-13	21	14	7

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ACEA95FQS1AVP	Jem	"I've never seen the BBC mini-series version, so I can only compare this to the book.  Naturally, large parts were cut or reduced (such as Wickham and Collins' parts).  All that information cannot be faithfully reproduced in the short time span of a movie, as it can in a miniseries.  However, the filmakers hit all the right notes in what they chose to include and how well it was rendered.  The movie focused on Lizzie and Darcy, which is of course the heart of the novel.The acting was top notch, especially Keira Knightly.  She deserved the Best Actress nomination as she fully embodied Lizzie.  I disagree with the reviewer below about Darcy's ""deadpan eyes.""  They lit up like the sun in the closing of the movie when his love was embraced by Lizzie--he was a misunderstood person and Matthew Macfadyen conveyed that.  Additionally, it was nice that for once Darcy didn't have to be a ""pretty boy.""  Rugged good looks can be just as dashing!  Donald Sutherland was a delight as Mr. Bennett, conveying his love and exasperation for a family of women with charm and dry wit.  He is a superb actor, and you could see that he truly cared about these women (and the actresses who played them).While the movie was spectacular, the DVD leaves a lot to be desired.  There are four main featurettes, but there is a lot of repetition between them.  The viewer need only watch ""Behind the Scenes at the Ball.""  The interviews with the cast in it are repeated for ""HBO First Look"" and ""A Bennet Family Portrait.""  The small biopic on Jane Austen was nice, but not very informative--focusing mainly on her home and where she wrote her novel.  Why not a complete biography?  And where are the deleted scenes?  Filmakers are notorious for filming more than they could ever include.  During the commentary, the filmakers mention that the dancing scene at the Ball between Darcy and Lizzie was completely recut and edited.  Why not show the original cut vis a vis the theatrical cut?  This film deserved the two-disk treatment--no doubt we'll get that in a year or two after we've all bought this version.  Hollywood sure knows how to treat the fans."	4.0	5 stars for the film, 2 for the DVD.	2006-03-23	9	7	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1E4Z6TNWFEJV	"jen l ""smartiewartie"""	This film was almost perfect.  While not completely true to every detail of the book, it captured the emotional essence of it.  What I remember loving the most about the book is Elizabeth's independence and wit, which Keira Knightly puts forth in spades.  In this movie Darcy becomes much more of a passionate man than in previous adaptations where his sexiest feature was his house.  Bingley also turns from a lout into a sweetly awkward and humble young man.  The scenery was great, and the dialogue cut for modern ears (again a good thing) so that every sentence that remained was essential.If I didn't love this movie so, I'd dock it one half star for the excruciating, tacked-on ending (why not listen to the British viewership that rejected it).  Another complaint: not enough Miss Bingley!  She was such an interestingly horrendous human being, and played to new, icy lows by Kelly Reilly.  In the book, Elizabeth and Darcy's takedowns of Caroline Bingley are some of the most delicious gotchas ever.  That storyline is great, and fairly central to the Elizabeth-Darcy relationship; it could have been preserved.In any case, it's the most spirited adaptation yet, and the one that, I believe, most deserved to be committed to film, because it retold the story most vividly.	5.0	Almost perfect	2007-04-23	10	7	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A6RMLEEUT58J5	Jennifer Allyn	Keira Knightly is just an appallingly bad actress nowhere near up to this role.  She is hauled along through this along with Matthew Macfadyen (Mr. Darcy) and Kelly Reilly (Caroline Bingley), slightly better actors but weak overall.  Actually, part of what disappoints one in Kelly is simply bad costuming - she dresses and gives the impression she's walking out of a rather elegant party sometime in the 20th century versus the 19th - her hair's wrong, too.  The rest of the cast is somewhat amazing in establishing a sense of authenticity and picking up their roles - the costuming and photography, the settings will suck you in and make you watch!  A heavy Hollywood thumbprint is unfortunately highly visible in a few scenes: the `Titanic' ending someone thought was a good idea! (Bull!) - and the Church `joke' that dared to take a perfectly respectable 19th century word and serve it up on a platter for modern sensibilities so that a hip-hop audience could giggle at it.  Sorry - you've just walked past the proscenium, it doesn't work - it murders the historical authenticity you've invested so much to establish!  Excellent performances: Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennett - so perfect but unexpected for this role), Tom Hollander! (Mr. Collins), Simon Woods (he glows), Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Bennett - this is such an easy role to steal!).  Amazing scenery.	3.0	Keira is a Klunker!	2006-07-26	11	5	6

While the 1995 version is groundbreaking, the modern update is breathtaking. The scenery, the costumes, the dialouge, the casting all work cohesively with only another.Keira Knightly's potrayl of perhaps the most poignant fictional heroine in ""romantic"" literature is flawless. I like, many other people, was not impressed by Matthew MacFadyen when I saw the preview; however, he was the perfect Fitzwilliam Darcy. Dark, mysterious and brooding in a more love struck fashion than Mr. Firth plays him. (Though, let it be said, I will ALWAYS love Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy).This film felt more like a continual thought than nthe 1995 version which, after all, is meant as a mini series. I loved every minute of it, and have seen it in the theater 3 times.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A226ZBHSGKOT6T	Jennifren	"If you've never seen or read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, this latest Pride and Prejudice re-make starring Keira Knightley  is an okay introduction.If you're a huge Jane Austen fan, then this movie is still okay for you. It's not nearly as disappointing as might have feared.I had concerns going into this movie, but none of them were borne out. The pace was rushed, but not too rushed; it jam-pack the story into 2 short hours, and unfortunately, certain storylines & characters were condensed to make them fit (Wickham-gasp!-was but a sidenote! ). Keira knightly brilliantly played Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennett. The plot and spirit stayed more-or less true to the book. I guess cliff notes are sufficient sometimes.Also, this remake adds something new to the Jane Austen cannon: verisimilitude to true 1700'ss life. Unlike other period remakes, which always show immaculate parlors, tidy living, and impeccably coiffed Young Ladies, this world was dirty and messy. Dogs roamed free through the Bennett home, food was grabbed and gobbled at the table, gentlemen weren't clean-shaven, and ladies obviously did not have the advantage of shampoo, hairspray, or styling products. The set felt more like noisy, dirty Colonial Williamsburg come to life, and not the hushed, immaculate parlors of BBC fantasy.But the best thing about this remake was the dance scenes. ""I do lore a ball"" is something Austen characters are wont to matter, and that passion comes off well on-screen here. Steady-cam images put you in the action, and the constant movement makes it fun to follow the intrigue. There is, however, too much of a good thing, and by the end of the second ball scene, I really wanted the cinematographer to go find a tripod!Overall, I enjoyed this movie. While it's not the triumph of the BBC remake, it's also not the disaster I feared it would be. The sweetness that appealed to me when I first read it, of characters who long for love but don't hook up til they get married, as well as the sarcasm & humor that only struck me later, all comes across on this movie screen. And probably will on DVD, too (no rush to the theater for this one)."	4.0	This P&P remake is dirty, but not disappointing	2005-12-03	16	11	5

It prompted me to pull the book off my shelf, which I had owned for 15 years or so, but just never made it past the first few pages because if the 18th century English it is written in.

The 1980 version is also decent.  They both give you the longer version of the story, which is definately worth seeing.  All that being said, this is still my favorite P&P - and probably my favorite movie of all time.  It renewed my love of period films, shows, and novels.  I can watch it over & over and still notice little things about it each time.  The attention to detail is wonderful.  It is shorted to 127 minutes, so you wont get the same scenes you got in the mini series, but they had almost 4 & 1/2 hours to go into the story.  But this does not take away from my love of this film.  It is beautifully shot, the scenery is so amazing to look at, the music is wonderful.  And the chemestry between Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen is undeniable.  They build such emotion with just a look.  Funny for me to remember seeing the advertisement and wondering who Matthew Macfadyen was and why they chose him.  After watching the film and falling in love with his version of Darcy, I am now a huge fan.  Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn are wonderful as Mr & Mrs Bennet.

Previous to receiving reviews, I had planned not to see this version, because to me the BBC version was definitive. I was extremely sorry to find that this version is noisy, busy, and much less good than the BBC version. The lines of dialogue are chipped out, barely said, you can hardly tell who anyone is, except for Bingley's huge head of hair, and all of the participants seem to be born in a barn. The slamped-t0-the-head hairstyle is old now and particularly unwelcome in the Georgian period. Further, Donald Sutherland fails to convince as Mr. Bennett. The whole thing struck me initially as horrid and a waste of time, upon viewing it again, scene by scene, I still think it lesser than the BBC version, but liked it better. However, if you are interested in Pride and Prejudice, watch the full BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle first.Further, this version has none of the beauty or satisfaction of the original BBC version, plus, the screenplay takes huge advantage and abuses the story. So enjoy the barnyard version of P&P.; There are beauties in this version, but not it's not quite as  satisfying as the A&E; version.	1.0	sadly much worse than the BBC version	2006-06-03	31	17	14

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3M0WMA4Z31RNE	"Jenny ""Jen"""	"This ""adaptation"" was utterly and completely useless.There was no innvation in it at all! How can you call it an adaptation when it did nothing new and moreover left out all the wit and satire that made both the book and the BBC film version wonderful?I could go on and on with the ""fast forwarding"" and the plot liberties and painting Elizabeth as a weak, love-struck little girl, but others have done so already. I'll just stick to the horrible casting:Keira Knightly is gorgeous. But her face and body are modern. And she is so thin in this movie that dear Lizzie looks like a POW.Darcy has absolutely no presence. He is a wet rag and has none of those magnetic qualities that he should have so as to make him attractive despite his pride and conceit.Bingley reminds me vaguely of Clay Aiken (and not in a good way) and his sister is like the Paris Hilton of Pemberly (also, not in a good way).Kitty, Lydia, and Mary have no personality, neither does Jane.Wickham, is, at least nice to look at, but too pretty to be as believably cunning and womanizing as his character should be.I understand why this movie was made - cheap romantic consumption, riding on the coat tails of better Austen adaptations etc. But please, for christ's sake, how did this get any academy award nominations? There was nothing in it! No spirit, no art at all - just copying.I'm really appalled. I hope the next generation of austen fans doesn't group this together with the wonderful adaptations that have already been made. Sense and Sensibility, Emma, et al. are in a class by themselves.Now.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AV9MQAN9DASP6	"JenOPCer ""JenOPCer"""	"As a Jane Austen fanatic, there are several things that drive me crazy in a movie:  unsuccessful attempts at ""sexing up"" Austen's works, a recklessness towards the culture her characters live in, and a disregard for Austen's wit.  Sadly, this movie (even more so than the awful Mansfield Park that came out a few years back), does all three.  First of all, I found the non-regency era clothing disconcerting and distracting.  It looked like ""Little House on the Prairie"" met Marie Antoinette.  Secondly, I got the uncomfortable feeling that the people at Harlequin romances had done the screenplay, and I actually laughed out loud when Darcy appeared across the moor with his shirt unbuttoned.  Finally, they made witty Mr. Bennett dull and mumbly (they took nearly all his humorous speeches out), and ridiculous Mr. Collins boring and sober.  I'm sure you've guessed I don't like Wuthering Heights at all, and it seems the people who filmed this version ""Pride and Prejudice"" do -- and perhaps wished that were the film they were making."	3.0	Did they even read the book?	2006-04-22	18	7	11

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A26MWGOVIES2BX	Jersey Girl	"Although I am a fan of both the book and the BBC film version with Ehle and Firth I approached this version of P & P with an open mind.  It does some things very well.  The production values, landscapes, great estates, and more gritty rural feel are outstanding.  The more understated casting of Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins was effective.  Bingley's sister is superb.  Knightley is lovely by 21st century standards, but she is too thin to have been considered a Regency era ""local beauty."" Judi Dench was an inspired choice as Lady Catherine but unfortunately gets only limited screen time. The distinctions of class and gentility that separate the Bennetts, Bingleys and Darcys are clearly drawn.  Now for what went wrong:  What lifts Austen's works above the average romance genre is her character development and superlative prose.  Both are lacking in this adaptation.  Neither Lizzie nor Darcy seem to change in essentials so their growing regard and sexual attraction for one another is inexplicable.  Wickham never demonstrates any hints of his true nature; why should Lizzie believe Darcy's version of events?  However, the most objectionable aspect of this film is the dialogue.  In some cases, the wording is overly modernized: Charlotte thinks that Jane should ""snap up"" Bingley; Lizzie refers to her love for Darcy as ""incandescent.""  Words are added, changed, or eliminated in ways that do nothing to advance the plot.  And in most cases, the pace of the dialogue is so rapid that it destroys the aura of the late 18th-early 19th century.  The setting is largely preindustrial; the pace of life was slower; the characters would not have rushed through conversations.  Finally, the ending scene was so trite and saccharine that I cringed in embarassment for the screen writer and the actors.  Some reviewers have argued, with some justification, that a two hour film cannot provide the nuances of a six-hour miniseries.  That said, there have been successful adaptations of Austen's work within a standard movie format.  Persuasion and Sense and Sensibility come to mind as adaptations that conveyed the essence of Austen's world and words despite the time constraints involved."	2.0	Can P & P be done well in 2 hours?

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AE9CF0P1P5SWH	Jessica Mosley	I, like most P&P fans, judge all movies against the iconic BBC miniseries.  (Colin Firth will always be Mr. Darcy!)  That being said, this movie is a wonderful, much shorter, alternative.  Keira Knightly is a believable Elizabeth Bennett and Matthew Macfayden is a solid Mr. Darcy.  The film itself is beautifully set and the score is phenomenal.  There are places where it deviates from the book, either to move the story along or make it more palatable for a broader audience...some of these are okay and some are not as okay, but overall it FEELS like P&P to me.  The worse part of the movie is the ending added for the American audience...its overly sappy and not at all in the spirit of Jane Austen.	4.0	Not BBC...but Good	2013-03-08	0	0	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1O4D0B2IO2K6T	Jewel Cardwell	I did not care for this adaptation of Pride & Prejudice.  I think it impossible to do P&P any kind of justice in 2 hours.  I felt that they tried too hard to pack the story into too short a time.  They glossed over, skipped and condensed too many events that, in my opinion, were essential to the build up of the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy.  You get no sense of Darcy's struggle with his attraction.  You barely get any sense of his attraction at all.  Overall, I am left with a sense of meh.	2.0	Mediocre at best	2011-12-29	2	1	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3J4LGVSY5KBOF	Jewel in the Crown	I must confess that I went into the theatre fully expecting to dislike this movie.  In the past one year, I have seen four literary adaptations (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire; The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants; and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe) and none of them has come close to doing justice to the books.  The magic of the story is always lost in the director's endeavour to commercialise it.  Therefore, I was very surprised to be absolutely delighted with this movie.Having read the reviews before watching the movie, I knew that the story had been tampered with quite a bit.  But, perhaps because P & P isn't one of my favourite books, or because I've resigned myself to the liberties that screenwriters take, or maybe just due to my love for everything belonging to the Regency Period, I didn't mind that in this movie.  The setting is more rural, but that lends a more authentic feel to the film and really made it seem as if the story was coming alive on the screen.  The two lead characters - Lizzie and Darcy - carry forth the story with aplomb.  The spirited Lizzie and the proud Mr Darcy belong to each other right from the very first moment they lay eyes on one another.  Much credit goes to Knightley and Macfayden for portraying their roles so convincingly - they live their characters and so make us live them as well.  The other characters, like Jane and Mr Bingley and Mr Collins, were not perhaps quite as I imagined them, but they are relatively insignificant, as the movie belongs to Knightley and Macfayden.  The climax near the end was beautifully done.  There were also a lot of witty dialogues which made my brother - who, it must be confessed, has never read the book, because he finds it boring - enjoy the movie very much.Some of the cinematography was wonderful; for instance, when they're dancing at the ball and after they've had their little battle of words, it seems as if they're the only two people in the room.  The sets were lovely - from rambling Longbourn to magnificent Pemberley - and the scenery was quite spectacular in some places.  The costumes were authentic, though I am quite certain women did not wear 'spaghetti straps' during the Regency Period.  But, overall, the feel was authentic and the period came alive as much as the story.To conclude, I would have to say that 'Pride & Prejudice' is not on my list of favourite books - I think anything Georgette Heyer wrote beats it hollow - and I am a complete purist when it comes to literary adaptations, but, despite those two facts, I enjoyed this movie very much.  The director certainly deserves credit for managing to portray the magic of the story despite all the liberties that were taken with it.  A delight to watch - it will definitely be part of my DVD collection in the near future.	4.0	A surprisingly enjoyable adaptation	2006-02-22	15	13	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3MVP7SFPH2XSW	J. Hansell	"When I first saw the movie (probably in a theatre when it first came out) I was entranced.  I had never seen the TV miniseries, so I had nothing to compare it to, and I'd only read the book once, years before. So I came at it fresh, and based my opinion only on what was onscreen. I thought that Knightley was brilliant, and captured the lighthearted but also serious sides of Lizzy, and that MacFadyen was, I have to say it, a dreamboat. The filming - the amazing tracking shots, the way it moves in and out of window, the character actors playing all the other roles (Blethyn, Hollander and Dench are all FANTASTIC), the incredible scenery and lively earthy settings - I loved it all. I even set some of the music as my phone ringtone!  I watched it occasionally on TV over the years, and have always loved it.I just bought the DVD (June 2012, 7 years later) and watched it all the way through in one sitting.  In the last few years, I've read all of Austen several times through, and watched many film and TV adaptations, including the Firth/Ehle P&P;, and the 2009 Emma with Jonny Lee Miller and Romola Garai. Both of those, as 4 part mini-series, can be much truer to the plot and pace of the book than a 2 hour movie can - this P&P; has to speed through the plot, especially the second half.  And I notice it more now - we miss a lot of the character development and the true friendship that develops between Darcy and Elizabeth.I still love a lot about it - it is gorgeous, the acting is mostly wonderful. But with Austen's language more fresh in my mind and ear, the departures from her words, and the made up dialogue and scenes (some of which are necessary - she never writes much dialogue for proposal scenes - and some of which are extremely unnecessary) were more jarring.  There were some cringeworthy changes - making Mr. Bennett weepy in the scene where he gives Lizzy's marriage his blessing; ""Yes, a thousand times yes"" spoken by Jane when she accepts Bingley's proposal, and most sadly, one of my favorite lines: ""you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I never want to be parted from you again."" It's just too pulpy for Austen - she would absolutely have made fun of such language.Despite these criticisms, it stands the test of time - it's one of my favorite Austen adaptations, alongside Emma (2009) and Mansfield Park (1999) by Patricia Rozema - another that's absolutely beautiful to watch but departs enough from the book to make a lot of fans angry."	4.0	Stands up over time	2012-06-29	2	1	1

Everything about it is supremely perfect --the cinematography (glorious), the musical score (fabulous), and the cast of actors (incomparable).  All the actors did a fantastic job -special mention for Brenda Blethyn who even made me like Mrs. Bennet (disliked Mrs. Bennet in the BBC production, she was a dingbat in that one).  Tom Hollander was great as Mr. Collins, and the Bennet girls, adorable.Kudos to Joe Wright for casting Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen in the lead roles.  FINALLY, a Lizzie and Darcy who are the ages they are SUPPOSED TO BE, and actually look it  (I couldn't say that about the BBC version, and Greer Garson was 36-yrs old when she played Lizzie in the Hollywood version...36??!!!?? OMG).The 2 lead roles I saved for last because their onscreen chemistry literally scorched the screen and they are, ultimately, what made this movie unforgettable.  Keira was amazing, luminous -she inhabited the role so completely, that she made you forget how ethereally beautiful she really is and made you believe that Lizzie's true beauty was one that came from within.Matthew MacFadyen...he turned the rain and the early morning mist into erotic scenery; the nuances he injected in playing a conflicted Darcy was phenomenal, and as stunning as Keira is, THIS Mr. Darcy will hijack your heart, and nothing will ever be the same again.	5.0	Perfection!	2006-06-18	19	12	7

The first mistake in this version, was to interpret it as a drama, a problem which was compounded by leaden direction, and a script with a tin ear for the comic nuances. This is a shame, since Keira Knightley is an excellent actress, and with a better script and direction, she could have shined in the role of Elizabeth Bennet.I recommend seeing either the great 1940's movie with Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier, or the outstanding 1990's mini-series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle instead."	2.0	Mediocre version of classic story	2013-12-24	1	1	0

It is for this reason that many things in the book are missed out and rushed through. The Bennets were not so poor that they will lived in a house that was substandard or had pigs and other animals living near them. Lizzie walking in the field at 4.00 am in the morning would not be the done thing. We lose a lot of the smaller characters and we do not get the time to get to know most of the characters.  Everything is rushed and the first ball was like one for the underclass and not people of this class. Jane's character is lessened in this version and Catherine De Burgh would not be travelling to see Lizie late at night either.  Some serious flaws in this version and too rushed. Keira Knightly is great but Mr Darcy lacks the conviction of the BBC version. It was a stab to make this story modern but much was lost in this version that made the BBC version a classic.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A8F2AZWB20X1H	JLind555	"I've lost count of how many films have been made of Jane Austen's best-loved book, but this latest release is far from the worst. That dubious honor in my view goes to the 1942 movie that had the characters parading around in what looked like wardrobe rejects from ""Gone With the Wind"" and Greer Garson at age 36 trying to convincingly play a 20 year old ingenue. Give me a break.The latest film, directed by Joe Wright, is a fairly faithful retelling of Austen's plot, which almost everybody and his mother is familiar with by now, with gorgeous visuals to hook us squarely into the time and place. The visuals, in fact, are so beautiful to look at that at times they tend to overwhelm the story.For anyone out there -- if there is anyone out there -- who doesn't know the plot, ""Pride and Prejudice"" introduces us to the Bennet family who belong to the upper-middle-class landed gentry in late 18th century England. The second daughter, Elizabeth, sharp as a marble and pretty to boot, meets Mr. Darcy, a tall, dark, handsome and single young man with money out the wazoo. It's loathing at first sight. He despises her middle-class connections; she thinks he's a stuck-up snob with an attitude. The rest of the story has them finding out how wrong they are about each other; there are a lot of interesting plot twists and turns, but in the end, of course, almost everybody ends up living happily ever after.Jane Austen told her sister Cassandra that she thought the book was ""rather too light and bright and sparkling"" but that is exactly what has endeared it to generations of readers in print and on film. Who doesn't love a good love story? But there is a problem with this version; perhaps, in trying to tell the whole story in two hours, it's told too much and not enough both at once. The second and third versions of ""Pride and Prejudice"", on BBC in 1980 and A&E; in 1995, were serialized over four to five hours and told the story pretty much as Austen wrote it, especially the BBC version, my personal favorite. Joe Wright's film tries to tell the whole story also but there's too much story for two hours to do it justice. As a result, the film feels compressed in spots. It feels truncated. We don't see nearly enough of Elizabeth's Aunt and Uncle Gardiner, two characters who are central to the book; Bingley's married sister and her husband are left out altogether, and the whole movie has a kind of rushed quality. You won't notice it if you haven't read the book and/or seen the BBC or A&E; movies, but you'll notice it a lot if you have.Joe Wright also took some positively unsettling liberties with the Bennets. In Austen's book they are an upper-middle-class family who are the ""principal inhabitants"" of the neighborhood. In Wright's film, they look like they've gone to seed. The cows are mooing in the back yard, the pigs are ambling into the premises through the back door, a harried-looking Mrs. Bennet and her daughters are toiling in the kitchen (although in the book Mrs. Bennet indignantly tells the Reverend Mr. Collins that her daughters have nothing to do in the kitchen as the family is perfectly well able to afford a good cook), and a bleary-eyed Mr. Bennet sits in his library looking unwashed, uncombed and unkempt. The whole establishment looks drab and dingy, in need of a good paint job. In the earlier movies Longbourn looks like a fairly prosperous estate; this movie conjures up images of Tobacco Road.Keira Knightley is a delight to watch as Elizabeth Bennet; she's smart, sassy and easy on the eyes. She's as good as Elizabeth Garvie was in the role in the BBC version and she's an improvement over Jennifer Ehle. Belinda Blethlyn is funny and ditzy as Mrs. Bennet, an insufferable airhead whose one goal in life is to marry off her brood. Dame Judi Dench is suitably Gorgon-like as Lady Catherine DeBourgh; it's a shame we don't see enough of her in the film either.The big problem for this reviewer was Matthew McFayden's interpretation of Darcy. For a lot of people who saw the other films, the gold standard for Darcy was Colin Firth, although not for this reviewer; I thought Firth was miscast as Darcy (ducking brickbats from Firth groupies as I type this). Firth was trying to be a very 90's Darcy, sensitive and vulnerable; but his Darcy wasn't Austen's Darcy by a long shot. McFayden plays Darcy as if he were racked with inner torment over his wealth and status; he comes off almost as insecure. If there is one thing Austen's Darcy isn't, it's insecure; he's almost too full of himself to be real until Elizabeth knocks him down a few pegs. McFayden was trying to bring out Darcy's soft side -- he has one, underneath all that starched armor -- but in doing so he underplays Darcy's haughty exterior to the point that we wonder what Elizabeth found so revolting about him in the first place. Something doesn't add up.Taken as a whole, the movie delivers in the time it has to do it in. There is no way to faithfully put ""Pride and Prejudice"" on film in only two hours.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3GIJRTWHTPE42	"Johanna J. Culver ""JoJo"""	"As a very loyal Jane Austen fan, I am unsure of how to even begin my discourse of the faults that abound in this pathetic display of complete disregard for periodic pieces!  I agree with the previously posted review that stated that were Jane Austen alive today she would be grieved...yes, and for her sake, many of her loyal fans certainly are!  How could Keira Knightley think she was portraying Elizabeth Bennet correctly?  How, for that matter, could ANY of the cast find their performances even adequate, much less outstanding?  Besides the problems already listed, and despite the fact that there are many, there is one in particular which stands out in my mind and causes me to cringe:  the scene near the very end of the film where Elizabeth and Darcy have married and are seen back at Pemberley.  Elizabeth comes out onto the terrace at night, wearing Mr. Darcy's oversize nightshirt!  This would never have been done, and certainly not out in the open where anyone might see!  Then, to make matters worse, she proceeds to sling herself up on a nearby table and sit cross-legged...a position no well-bred woman would have assumed, and certainly not on a table!  The final horror that adds to this parade of miserable mistakes is when Darcy actually joins her on the table, sitting behind her and holding her in a way which would seem sweet in the modern setting of a chick flick, but which is grossly out of tune with what is supposed to be a period piece.In fact, it is not just this one scene which so scathingly grates on the nerves of loyal Austen fans, but the overall lack of any understanding of time period!  The actors all seem just that--acting (and very badly) in a story set in a completely foreign time period to them.  They seem lost the whole time, as if they aren't sure what they are supposed to be doing, and their performances keep the audience from being drawn into the story.  If the goal of the film industry was to take a wonderful, timeless classic and remake it with something modern audiences could relate to, they have failed miserably; for by trying to ""modernize"" this story, they take away the very essence of its timeless appeal.  This is a story which is timeless not because of its settings, but in spite of them.  What makes this book so good and so intriguing for so many generations is that it is a fabulous character study and we can all relate to the very human characters in Pride and Prejudice.  We feel their pain, embarrassment, excitement, joy, anger, and pride--we can relate to them and understand them, even if we don't know firsthand what it feels like to live in a society like theirs.  The rules of etiquette which bound them are not impressed upon us today, but we can still enjoy the story, and feel for the characters.  But take away those very rules and the story becomes completely lackluster and stupid--and certainly not worth telling!The argument may be made that audiences today don't understand the society of Jane Austen's day, so we must modernize the story somewhat.  To that I say that we should not cater to the modern audiences' lack of regard for history, but rather we should try to acquaint people with the way things were.  It doesn't have to feel like a history lesson...but it should be historically correct.  If we cannot do so without skewing the story, we should leave it be, rather than ruin a beautiful classic.The overall costumes, makeup,  and attitudes of the whole cast are outrageously misplaced.  Though we cannot be too harsh on the actors--we must lay much of, if not all, the blame at the director's feet.  After all, he has the final say in what goes into his film and how it is to be portrayed.  Obviously, no one connected with this film's production cared to consult the book or history of that period...or so we must assume by the lack of believability in the whole portrayal.Lest anyone think I am attacking Keira Knightley or any of the cast personally, let me just say that I have nothing against any of the actors when they are in their element--the kind of films they and their directors understand.  Perhaps, though, they should have taken the cast of this film and produced a modern chick flick.  They could certainly not have done any worse.If the film industry in general must produce bad romance films, they should at least confine the damage they feel must be done to stories set in this time period, so that they might have a chance at getting something right, and they should be advised to leave well enough alone in tampering with great literature which has many fans.  I feel very sorry for anyone who is introduced to Pride and Prejudice in this film version, as they will probably either hate it because it is so bad, or will think it a ""cute"" romance movie, without knowing the excellent taste they are missing from the original story."	1.0	Atrocities Abound	2007-01-13	54	39	15

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AEGYKCHYY809X	John Chandler	This is a review of the Blu ray release only not the film as such which has been covered elsewhere. The main problem is with the sound track. As has been pointed out by another reviewer everyone speaks so fast it is hard to catch what is being said. The subtitles which would normally help are an absolute disaster: The speaker location system is used which results in the subtitles frequently running to three lines but they also hop about - left, centre or right, even top and bottom - depending where the speaker appears on the screen. To make it more difficult, like the speech, they are displayed only fleetingly and it is too often impossible to read them before they are gone. A further issue is the balance: speech is generally overpowered by the music and one is constantly fiddling with the volume control.The picture quality is acceptable but I did not find it as sharp or as well color balanced as I had hoped. The BBC Blu ray is of course a different version of the story but it is technically very good, especially considering its age and original format, and vastly superior to this most disappointing transfer.	2.0	The Blu ray is an irritating disappointment	2010-02-20	20	14	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2MDTM1IXX8HXF	John Farrell	Okay that sounds harsh, and much as I liked the production design and the performances of the two leads, on the whole the entire production is undercut by a rushed pace. Obviously you can't cram the whole book into two hours, but this it seems is exactly what the director tried to do. No discredit to the screenwriter--who obviously worked hard to keep the best lines from the book in the movie--but Keira Knightley is forced to sputter most of them at such a speed that all comic timing is destroyed and the viewer is left irritated. Those who haven't read the book will probably not only feel irritated but also confused as to what is going on. The supporting cast is wasted. Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennett seems indifferent, rather than amoral and witty as he was portayed in the magnificent BBC version. Brenda Blethyn's performance is also undercut by poor staging and dreadful editorial choices. Whole lines of exposition are lost in transition from one scene to the next, and the musical score veers from understated to over-the-top.I realize it's a tall order to follow the superb quality of the BBC version of 1995. But this production doesn't even come close.	2.0	Jane Austen for the ADD generation	2006-03-27	21	7	14
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3374HP1UQKUOO	John F. Pepple	"The only reason I'm adding yet another review of this movie is the idiocy of people who keep comparing it to the 1995 miniseries.  Yes, the miniseries was utterly fantastic, but the movie is superior to the miniseries in at least two scenes.One is the scene in which Elizabeth first encounters Mr. Darcy at Pemberley.  According to the book, Elizabeth is so embarrassed that she ""scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face.""  Take a look at how the two actresses did this scene.  I am confident that everyone will agree that Keira Knightley did a better job.  Jennifer Ehle generally did a splendid job in the miniseries, but this was a rare occasion when she slipped a little.The other scene is the one in which Elizabeth explains to her father why she wants to marry Mr. Darcy.  The miniseries cuts this scene short from what we have in the book, while the movie shows the whole thing.  Isn't it important to show Elizabeth telling her father what Mr. Darcy had done for the family?  After all, it's a huge weight lifted from his shoulders.  The result is that the miniseries ends this scene with Mr. Bennet looking rather solemn, while the movie, following the book, has him laughing and joking.And why did the miniseries not give us the full scene?  It's because they insisted on spending nearly a minute and a half - it feels like half an hour - on the double wedding of Jane and Elizabeth.  This is strange because we actually learn virtually nothing about their wedding from the book; in fact, we learn more about Charlotte's wedding than we do about Jane and Elizabeth's.And this lengthy scene also prevents the miniseries from doing what I believe no version has done so far, namely show the scene in which Elizabeth tells her mother she is marrying Mr. Darcy.  It is such a shame that they didn't do it because the two actresses involved, Jennifer Ehle and Alison Steadman, were so superb.  I hope that the next time this story is filmed, we will get to see that scene."	4.0	It has its moments	2006-12-18	17	12	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2DSXA1E02C86D	Joseph Haschka	"Some considerable time ago, I watched the BBC miniseries presentation of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, a chick-flick if there ever was one starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, at the urging of a Jane Austen-obsessed female friend. When I reluctantly admitted that I thoroughly enjoyed it, I realized that I must resign my long-standing membership in the Neanderthal Male Fellowship. Now, much to my horror and apparently diminished masculinity, I have to say that this 2005 version of P & P was even more captivating and better than the BBC version in all respects, albeit much shorter in length.The plot of P & P needs no extensive recapitulation here; if you don't know it by now after many cinematic renderings, then forget it. Briefly, the story surrounds five unwed daughters of a son-less English country gentleman, Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland), in financial decline in the early 19th century (or, as in this new version, the late 18th). The girls, particularly the eldest Jane (Rosamund Pike), the second eldest, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), and the third eldest, Lydia (Jena Malone), get caught up in a romantic tangle with a plethora of would-be suitors: the perky young gentleman Charles Bingley (Simon Woods), the darkly moody young nobleman Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), the dashing Army officer Lt. Wickham (Rupert Friend), and the weasley cleric cousin William Collins (Tom Hollander). The girls' fear of impending spinsterhood is whipped into a froth by the maternal anxieties of their foolish and marriage-obsessed mother (Brenda Blethyn). Mr. Bennet accepts his fate as the sole male in this estrogen-driven household with a certain bemused resignation. In any case, the focus of the story is on Elizabeth (""Lizzie"") and Darcy, whom the former initially despises as arrogant and boorish. It's Darcy's pride and Lizzie's prejudice that must come to terms in this comic opera of social customs and manners.This version of P & P has been criticized by purists for at least two reasons, both of which are irrelevant to me since I haven't read, nor do I intend to read, the original Austen novel. First, the financial health of the Bennet clan is, apparently, reduced from that in the book (and, indeed, from that in the BBC miniseries). Indeed, while the family still employs servants and seems to have enough food on the table, their lifestyle here is noticeably more seedy - almost grubby - than previously depicted. Well, why not? It's this desperate condition caused by an aging patriarch and lack of a male heir that has Mom and her brood worked into a frenzy about their future prospects. Indeed, cousin William, due to inherit the estate on Mr. Bennet's death, is already nosing around inspecting the goods. Second, fault has been found with Macfadyen's Darcy as less obstinate, i.e. self-assured, in his pride than Firth's version. Now, while I readily admit that Firth's Darcy is perhaps his career's best role, I find Colin generally to be a Lump in all his screen roles. Matthew's version displays an anguished vulnerability beneath the proud veneer that's tapped by his attraction to Keira's Lizzie. And what man in his right mind wouldn't be? Keira's version is a Bewitching Babe with two capital Bs. (All through the screening, I strained to remember where I'd seen Macfadyen before; he's not exactly a familiar face on American Big Screens. Afterwards, I remembered that he plays the lead in the current British telly miniseries ""MI5"".)This P & P, as befitting a major production, has cinematography that is, at times, positively luminous, and the camera work is more adroit and clever than anything seen previous. Three scenes were, for me, particularly memorable: the visual isolation of Lizzie and Darcy from the rest of the revelers at The Ball, Lizzie's changing view of the Bennet estate as she spins in a swing hung under an arch, and Mrs. Bennet's inclusion, white petticoats flying, in a flock of scurrying white, silly geese as she pursues a rebellious daughter across the yard. These visuals were positively inspired.There are no acting performances here anything less than superb. Special mention must be given to Judi Dench as the imperious Lady Catherine, Sutherland as the overwhelmed, gentle Mr. Bennet, and Hollander's brilliant rendition of the pathetic Collins.Yes, I like this PRIDE AND PREJUDICE more than I can adequately explain. It may, perhaps, land a place on my Ten Most Favorite Films list."	5.0	Luminous	2005-11-25	20	15	5

In this case, Kiera Knightley was born to play the part of Elizabeth Bennett.  Her natural beauty and tough demeanor makes her a duplicate of this character.There have been several adaptations of the book by Jane Austen.  Some have been quite long.  This version is an intriguing and engaging version.  One aspect that makes this version lively and entertaining are the various camera angles.  You actually feel that you are there and can hear every conversation being spoken.  You have that feel that you are ""gliding around"" as you hear Elizabeth talking to her best friend or Mr. Darcy secretly confiding to Charles Bingley his thoughts on the Bennetts.Great adaptation.

Not only are there many changes and additions to Austin's plot, but the setting is partially wrenched from the early 19th century to add some of today's manners.  Yet Austin's stories are all about manners!  I didn't like it that the father figure is portrayed looking like a drunk on a 5-day binge (extremely dirty and messy looking, 5-day's beard, stringy hair)rather than as an intellectual.  I didn't like that the portraits of Georgiana and Darcy were transformed into nude statues (with Jane looking pointedly at the front of the male version).  Mr. Collins I found more earnest than stupid.  Some changes were of course necessary to shorten the story, but I found many changes that didn't need to be made, that for me detracted from the whole.	3.0	Austin It's Not	2006-04-03	28	13	15
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AR7HOO02LJAAI	JS	My wife adores this movie so I had to give it a try. The movie was ok, but I just don't see what is supposed to be so romantic about it. The movie concerns four daughters who all get married and their mother who is obsessed with getting them to the altar. Two get married to jerks, two of them to nice guys. But the main story revolves around Elizabeth and Mr Darcy, and how they go from hating each other to falling in love. This would be romantic... if they had spent any time together! But they fall completely in hate and love after a few short sporatic conversations, with scarcely any time alone. Maybe that's how people fell in love in the early 19th century, but I just wasn't convinced. I felt like these characters still hardly even knew each other. Now I imagine to make this film a great deal was probably cut out of the book, so those who read the book may not feel like so much is missing.The scenery and costuming is very good, and the acting is top rate, although Donald Sutherland's accent sounds a little American. Definitely a woman's movie, but men can focus on Keira Knightly, who is incredibly beautiful here.	3.0	Must be missing something here	2007-01-28	11	3	8

I am one of those people who can point out how much movie destory...well changes the original story. Trust me, there were a couple of parts that where in the book that were excluded from the film. There was even a scene was the scriptwriter should have caught( Lady Catherine de Bough came to visit Lizzy at night and made a comment about the garden then cut back to request well demand a private audience with Lizzy).I have seen many versions of the P&P; and this one is my favorite. The chemistry and acting was wonderful. I felt like for 2hrs I watching Lizzy and Mr. Darcy not Keira and Matthew.  Over all I felt like Charles Bingley was too naive and goofy. That was really the only character that I now despised. The interactions between all the characters are believible.Be warned that there is a lot of giggling in this more. A little bit more than I care for. I still think that the movie stays close to the characters' true nature(except for Charles. Read paragraph b/4 this one). I prefer not to disect everycharacter's personality. As far the extras, there aren't any deleted scenes (good thing....no confusion). They aren't the best package. Would I have bought the dvd just for the extras? Only if it was free. Out of the whole movie there is only one profane word at the end.

I could write for days, but to sum up my feelings: I didn't feel Knightley portrayed Elizabeth as she should be...Knightley's version was more pouty, angry, miffed all the time, rather than playful and teasing as she should be. I didn't feel any chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy. Wickham was almost nonexistant, which is a major problem, since we really need to understand how awful he is to understand the storyline! I understand that in a feature length adaption, some details had to be sacrificed, but I feel that anyone who isn't familiar with the material will be lost, or at least won't appreciate all that is happening properly. That said, it had some parts that were well done, the scenery was lovely...but the end, with all the Mrs. Darcy's...ugh! I love a good romance, but that almost make me ill!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2HWJS01XEGJK8	"Julie ""Give me your tired heroines , your hud..."	"For the sake of starting with something positive, let's throw out the very biggest problems like historical placement and accuracy. Being set a full 50 years earlier than Austen's story is entirely wrong but not worth bleating over. Oddly, the best way to portray rural dwellers of the day is deny them soap and water. There is a strange film over everyone as if they'd all been awake for a solid week and were not given time to shower before getting onto the set. Let's even try to forgive Grand Mal errors like Bingley entering the bedroom of an overnight female guest. Huh? If we can get stupid enough to ignore a boat load of other similar problems, we might at least admit that this movie was beautifully designed and very well captured. Watch this thing with the sound off, and you'll enjoy some remarkable cinematography.But no lavish castles or livid sunrises can rescue this mess.First, we'd have to cut off the head of the beast in terms of raw materials and leadership. The screenplay borders on jabberwocky, honoring only the most banal of Austen's dialog.  And despite being the epic romance, director Joe Wright isn't able to coax anything more than a lukewarm shrug from any of the key players.Speaking of key players, let's look at casting.Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean, King Arthur) reduces the smart and self-possessed Elizabeth to little more than teen petulance. She strides triumphant through the movie, always armed with some well worn leather-bound tome (we can safely assume it's not Stanislavski), looking for ways to disarm people with her aplomb. Unfortunately, Knightley has a limited number of tools with which to construct the fa?ade. One is a frightening and toothsome grin-laugh thing that turns her into a Rankin/Bass villain (a'la Burgermeister, the Bumble, HeatMiser, etc). The rest of the time, Knightley relies on her jutting jaw and droopy lip to illicit a blatant sexuality (which happens to be completely wrong for this character). However, instead of pouty sex kitten, this trick looks as if a large dose of thorazine is just kicking in. We half expect a ribbon of drool to escape down her chin at any moment.Then there is our darling Darcy. No one will ever touch the haughty torment of Colin Firth. Even if we hadn't seen Firth's Darcy, Macfadyen would seem a bit flat. We get precious little of his prickly pride (which is fairly significant to the story, being in the title and all). His too-soft underbelly is exposed the minute he sets eyes on Elizabeth, which irrevocably breaks the seal on his crusty credibility. The most powerful aspect of this romance is how it so utterly surprises Elizabeth - and us - when he makes that first proposal. Watching Macfadyen spill the beans in his first 10 seconds on screen leaves very little reason to keep watching. He could have benefited from just a bit of Caroline Bingley's over-the-top nastiness.As for the rest of the cast, they come in two flavors: shallow and boring, or giggly and squirming like cheerleaders in the back of the bus. One has to wonder if it took more than thorazine to get the rest of the cast through this project, particularly after seeing Donald Sutherland's version of Mr. Bennett. Dreamy and completely disconnected, laudanum appears to be his buffer of choice. Of course we expect Lydia and Kitty to be in the throes of an Ecstasy binge, which they are, yet still manage to disappoint us. And poor Mr. Collins (actor Tom Hollander, who also plays the deliciously neurotic and ruined Anthony Meredith in Gosford Park) is stoned out of his head and on the brink of full-on paranoia, although trying very ...hard ...not to be. He was definitely capable of giving David Bamber (the A&E; version Collins) a run for his money in this role. Unfortunately, ""big eyes and stick-in-the-arse marionette movement"" must have been Wright's direction for the unfortunate Hollander.Countless smaller irritations abound: The evil Mr. Wickham has roughly 9 words of dialog with which to make us first love and then despise him (a fancy trick for any actor, let alone someone with no noticeable screen time). Dame Judy Dench is cast once again as the fiery old crone (Lady Catherine de Bourg) which is exactly the same as every other role she's been saddled with for the last 10 years. What a tragic waste.  Even Charles Bingley's sunny disposition seems to be drawn in crayon. Far from the agreeable innocent we all adore, he comes off as weak and mildly retarded (and seemingly incapable of combing his particularly unruly shock of red hair). The result is some kind of love child of Liberace and Howdy Doody. Darcy would have never befriended someone like this. And not just because of the hair. Brenda Blethyn (Little Voice, Saving Grace) turns in the only enjoyable performance as the terminally squirrelly Mrs. Bennett. At least she's fun to watch, albeit in the manner of a fuzzy rodent with a firecracker tied to her tail.This is two thumbs way, way down. Down as in, to induce vomit after accidentally ingesting drain opener. The only thing that might have been slightly harder to swallow was the 2003 modernized version sent up by director Andrew Black. I'd rather see JACK Black in the director's chair. Naked.When will Hollywood learn that unless you bleed every 28 days or are named Ang Lee, you're not qualified to handle Jane Austen? Go tackle the Bronte sisters. And there must be at least a half dozen more gladiator movies waiting to be made or remade. Heck, take Dickens on another spin around the dance floor! But leave the next Austen adaptation to the BBC or PBS where they might still care more about characters and story than honoring a 5-picture deal for the latest tarted-up teen stars."	1.0	Visual Feast, Character Famine	2006-04-30	71	41	30

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A8QG61LYK0XO1	JUST A REVIEWER2	"What more can be said.........Keira's Elizabeth is a one-of-a-kind:  Lizzie is a glittering star beginning to end.  Ah, but it is Matthew's Darcy who grabs this viewer throughout.  It's he I hope to see, who I watch for to appear in every scene, background....foreground....where is he?  But, why he, you may ask?  Well, it's because of the ""Darcy's fall"" which we begin to see that he is giving us.  And we know, if we but think of it, that from that first sidewise glance he gives Lizzie in the film's beginning ball scene, he is lost and ""Darcy's fall"" has begun.There are just two scenes that I can watch, watch, watch, re-watch, rewind and watch again.  In order of my passion for them, they are:  (1) The pouring rain, outdoor pavilion scene where ""Darcy's fall"" has neared its end and he declares his love to Lizzie (the intensity of that final moment, with their physical closeness and their seen and felt overpowering desire to kiss, is overwhelming for us).  (2)  That near-dawn, meadow scene in which each discovers the other walking, Lizzie because her fear of lost love keeps her from sleeping, Darcy because he must seek her out for one last try.  And when their approach one to the other is done, and we hear him--emotions on fire--stutter out to her:  ""I love....love....I love you,"" we know then.....at that very moment.....""Darcy's fall"" into love is now complete.****"	5.0	"Watch for ""THE FALL"".................."	2007-04-21	11	8	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2KSMKW7DZ37MG	Just my 2 cents	"As a fan of the 1995 BBC version, this P&P; had to grow on me. It took two watchings to do just that, and I now rate it higher than the older miniseries. Some purists are upset about this modern take (Just read the lower rated reviews), but I think they should at least acknowledge an original attempt at an old novel. And this P&P; does just that - breathe new life into a tale everyone knows.For starters, the imagery in this movie is breathtakingly luscious. Imagine colour so bright and vivid you can almost taste it and amazing country settings that ooze sensuality. It is a very passionate film, in its settings and actors and the chemistry between Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen (Elizabeth and Darcy) is a palpable, living entity that reflects in the scenery. (such as Elizabeth's awakening sensuality in the art gallery at Pemberley. And how gorgeous were those statues?) Really, this movie made me want to run out and buy an English country estate for a couple million pounds (which I don't have :)There are so many great things about this film. The actors are spot-on. Initially I thought Keira too giggly but then I realised that in the book she was a young woman and should act as any other young woman throughout the ages. Tom Hollander's portrayal of Collins is exciting and believable (As a clergyman, he would be very sexually frustrated indeed). Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy sometimes looks a little too sulky for my tastes but that thankfully doesn't take away from his smoldering performance (with such a gorgeous voice to boot). My favs: the scene at Charlotte's house - he literally bursts in and looks so ill at ease you feel sorry for him - the two proposals and strutting across the countryside in the early morning hours!!! Oh my beating heart!!). Mr and Mrs Bennet have a believable marriage and the family's obvious ""country poverty"" make it clear why Darcy would have so much difficulty in the initial stages loving Elizabeth.Unfortunately, it's not quite perfect, hence the half star. There should have been more Elizabeth/Darcy interaction which could have been achieved if they'd taken out some unnecessary shots. It felt sometimes the shot was done for the sake of looking good, rather than contributing anything meaningful to the story. (E.g. the swing scene, the ballroom tracking shot, the shot of Elizabeth standing at the edge of the cliff, the moon shot after Elizabeth and Jane talk in bed - all beautiful to look at but really not that necessary. In addition the talking in the dance scene between Elizabeth and Darcy is a little awkward since some lines are delivered when they're not face to face.Yet that doesn't take away from what is a fully fleshed out picture with real people, dealing with still relevant problems, instead of recite-lines-from-an-idealised-book characters."	4.0	4 1/2 stars out of five	2010-04-29	3	2	1

IMO it does not because one of the key players is sorely miscast. While Keira Knightly is luminous as Elizabeth Bennett I thought Matthew McFayden's ""Mr. Darcy"" was dull and and more melancholy looking than arrogant/proud. The actress who portrayed Jane appeared much older than she actually is in real life. Poor Dame Judi Dench who I love in so many other films does not have the features to pull off an aristocratic member of the peerage. She resembled a pillow that had been adorned with finery but to no avail...still unbecoming. The rest of the cast and the beautiful English countryside made it a tolerable film, however, I would much prefer to own the BBC version."	3.0	Not As Good As The BBC Version	2006-03-01	12	4	8

I loved the book; this film was atrocious and boring (all the meaningless, added dialogue!). I'd probably say that even if I weren't an enormous Austen fan and hadn't felt like this was a travesty to Austen's legacy: no subtlety or humor, and completely dumbed down. Read the book, watch the BBC miniseries (in that order)--don't waste your time on this film.	1.0	One of the worst films I've ever seen	2006-06-17	29	19	10

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1WWMURVG4YP4C	Kacie	It's always a challenge to successfully adapt a beloved classic novel into a film, maintaining the plot and spirit of the story. Joe Wright's Pride & Prejudice accomplished this amazingly well. Aside from a few necessary omissions due to time constraints (and yes, a couple of small changes - which I think worked for the better on screen), this version adheres to the original story faithfully. The casting and acting was superior on all accounts. Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen have scorching hot chemistry. I am typically not a huge fan of Knightly, but I think she took on the character of Lizzie superbly. Brenda Blethyn had me laughing out loud at her portrayal of Mrs. Bennet. Donald Sutherland is very touching in his role as Mr. Bennet, and the actresses rounding out the Bennet family performed flawlessly, even though two of them (Talulah Riley and Carey Mulligan) had practically no acting experience before this film was made. I don't even need to mention Judi Dench - we all know she is one hell of an actress.Beyond the story and characters, the cinemetography is absolutely breathtaking. This film is like a painting come to life. You can freeze-frame almost any shot in this entire film, put it on canvas, and hang it on your wall. It's THAT good. This film is a feast for the eyes if there ever was one. Hats off to Joe Wright and the entire crew for their work of art in motion.	5.0	Perfection	2011-10-27	4	3	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ALLJT7S5QOFFZ	kaduzy	"This is a wonderfully made film, one of those well-crafted pieces where every frame could be a painting.  The performances were fantastic and as someone who has never read a Jane Austen book or seen a Jane Austen film adaptation (unless you count ""Clueless (Special Whatever! Edition)"") I was very new to this world.  And I liked it!  The ending of the movie is what really got me, that and the score.  The piano score was perfectly lovely, and I may have to buy it on CD.The extras on this DVD don't add much of anything.  Director Joe Wright's commentary is dull as dishwater and the interviews with the cast are repeated on different special featurettes to the point where you benefit the most from watching only one of them.  But overall, if you somehow missed this gem, I suggest renting it and catching up because it's well worth your time!"	4.0	I never read the book but I definitely enjoyed the movie!	2008-02-15	5	3	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A29SWPKMDPP33D	Karen Beth Martin	Where do I begin here?  This version is too pretty, too theatrical and too high-budget.  Instead of beautifully portraying the characters, this movie seems more intent on showing the landscape, the nice sets, the houses, etc.  They leave out SO much!For starters, Lizzie and Jane are plain silly in this version.  The Lydia and Kitty and Mary characters aren't developed AT ALL.  They do not do justice at all to the closeness of Lizzie and Jane and they don't even TOUCH on the closeness between Lizzie and Mr. Bennett, which is a HUGE injustice to the story.  And Mr. Collins isn't silly enough; he is just dull and not an asset to the film at all.  And Mr. Bingley acts an idiot who isn't educated at all.  Very sad.Everything about it is just WRONG.  Kiera Knightley is NOT a Lizzie at all.  She doesn't have it in her.  The only remotely good thing about this film is Judi Dench as Lady Catherine.  Dench is such an excellent actress and brings a bit of quality to any film she does, no matter how bad it is otherwise.Save your time and money and watch the BBC version with Colin Firth.  This version is like Sesame Street compared to the BBC version.	1.0	Pathetic version... REALLY BAD!	2006-07-30	34	22	12
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2KJ523UYGN8EX	Karen C Groves	I loved this movie, the music and the way it was filmed. It was romantic from start to finish.No, it didn't follow the book a hundred percent, but I loved it anyway. It was so beautifully done that it touched the heart. And isn't that what entertainment should do? The entire book was condensed to a fraction of the time, was done with good taste and kept the essence of Jane Austen's book. And I thoroughly enjoyed Keira Knightley's and Matthew Macfadyen's portrayals of Elizabeth and Darcy.And I appreciated the director and his handling of the various scenes and emotions that go along with loving someone. Although, I have the 1995 version with Colin Firth and have seen a little of it, I will probably prefer the 2005 version over all of them.

However, that being said, this movie is a poorly done version of a classic novel.Here are my problems with the film:1.  Character butchering.  Mr. Bingley was portrayed as a moron in this ""adaption"" of the novel.  Mr. Bingley was never stupid or insipid.  The relationship b/w Mr. and Mrs. Bennett-as  lovely-dovely when in fact, Mr. Bennett could barely tolerate Mrs. Bennett and her silliness.2. The lack of chemistry or build up for the relationship of Darcy and Elizabeth.  There was very little interaction b/w Lizzy and Darcy that would even suggest a reason why either would love each other.  It was quite sudden with absolutely no explanation.3. The Bennetts were not poor, as Mr. Bennett was a gentleman, not a field hand.  The Bennett house looked like a common persons home with pigs and animals walking in and out if it as it that was not unusal.  Additionally, the Bennett girls, especially Lizzy were always unkept and untidy.  Daughters of a gentleman do not look like rag-a-muffins. Lizzy's hair was always undone and coming out.4.  The confrontation b/w Elizabeth and Lady Catherine was extremely contrived.  Lady Catherine would never visit Elizabeth that late at night.  Judy Dench did an admirable job with Lady Catherine, however, the character was written poorly.Overall, this movie was barely tolerable.  It did not deserve any of the accolades it received, esp, the Oscar nomination for Ms. Knightley.If you are a true fan of the novel, watch the BBC mini-series, as it captures the true spirit and essence of the book."	1.0	A watered-down poorly done version of a great novel	2006-04-14	53	34	19

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1IOJE0W1NXOSE	Karen Potts	"From the breathtaking English countryside to the finely-honed performances, this movie is a real delight.  All of Jane Austen's characters are there:  the long-suffering Mr. Bennett, the manic, matchmaking Mrs. Bennett, the lovely Jane, the feisty Elizabeth, the dour Mr. Darcy, the affable Mr. Bingley, and the imperious Lady Catherine.  Many of the lines are taken directly from the book, and the important plots and subplots are all there.  The sharp divisions between social classes are evident, as is the scheming behind who is to marry which man and receive which yearly income.  The casting is superb, from Donald Sutherland as the befuddled and very much outnumbered male in the Bennett household to Judi Dench, in the small but pivotal role of Lady Catherine.  ""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of my favorite books and this movie truly does it justice."	5.0	Beautifully-made version of a timeless classic	2006-05-22	10	7	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3G869LR016ID	Katherine E. Robertson	It's very difficult for me to believe that anyone associated with the making of the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice actually read the book. I can believe that they read the Cliff notes as they got the names right anyway. Lizzy was spirited and strong willed perhaps for her time, but the constant giggles, the rudeness in Church, the lack of propriety; wandering around outside at night in her nightclothes, not wearing a hat outside, unkempt hair, gave me the impression that Keira Knightly was playing Keira Knightly, and not Elizabeth. Jane seemed more true to form but the blonde streaks in her light brown hair? Did she get those in a salon in London or just pick up hair dye in the local super market? There was so very little character development. George Wickham was supposed to be a villain but if you blinked while he was on screen or yawned while Mr. Darcy minimally described the role Mr. Wickham had in his life you certainly would not have known that. Lizzie's speech to Mr. Darcy about the downfall of her younger sister in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Gardner was just plain bizarre. I had no idea that Mrs. Bennett drank too much in public, nor that she, and the girls did so much housework, in fact the book tells us that they did not. If the pig being escorted through the house was supposed to mean something I did not get it. Lizzy standing on the cliff was the Titanic wasn't it?  Didn't Lizzy realize that she really had been prejudiced against Mr. Darcy by listening to the very positive things about him and the very negative things about Mr. Wickham as related by the long term housekeeper? Don't look for that in this film because she is not even in it. The portrait of Mr. Darcy is now a statue placed in what looks like a museam. Would the Lady Catherine De Bourghe really descend on the Bennett household in the middle of the night and then go and visit her nephew at the home of Mr. Bingley? Was this supposed to be a joke? Is this an example of British humor and the real film is coming out next year?	1.0	Did Anyone Associated With This Film Actually Read the Book?	2006-03-09	74	54	20

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A39TJ4ZS77KTBB	Kathleen Ryan	"When I first heard that a cinematic version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" was being made, with Keira Knightley as its star, I felt the first quivers of trepidation -- but when I finally was able to view the finished product, my trepidation rapidly escalated to alarm, outrage, bewilderment and ultimately disgust.I am NOT a self-proclaimed ""Janeist"" or ""purist"" and am completely willing to believe that a great film version of one of my all-time favorite novels can be made; however, I simply cannot understand why THIS movie was made, other than as a commercial endeavor designed to capitalize on Keira Knightley's previous successful turn in ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""  I shudder to think of (and in fact know several of) the masses of young girls who now think of this abomination as the definitive ""Pride and Prejudice"" and will never go on to read the real thing, never mind see the truly definitive BBC miniseries version.Here's my point:  if you are going to significantly change aspects of a classic and beloved story (and, let's not forget, a classic story that has often been called one of the most perfectly constructed pieces of fiction in the history of English literature), do it with respect.  DON'T leave the story in its historically correct timeframe and then ""dumb it down"" with modern vernacular, manners (or lack thereof) and sentiments.  DON'T totally discard the mores and social graces of the time period in question (to wit:  families such as the Bennetts did NOT have pigs (!)running in and out of their house, nor was mealtime a free-for-all of reaching and grabbing.  Nor would Lady Catherine deBurgh have EVER, under any circumstances, descended upon the Bennett household in the middle of the night regardless of her outrage.)  If you feel moved to make changes, for heaven's sake, make ACCURATE changes.I also must strenously object to the way many major characters are portrayed in this version, at variance with the book.  For example, Mr. Bennett, as written by Jane Austen, is clearly unhappy in his marriage and has no respect or affection for a woman whose looks turned his head in his youth but has long since proven herself to be ill-suited in nearly every way to be his life partner.  In this film version, Mr. Bennett (as portrayed by Donald Sutherland, who is entirely capable of a more correct and acerbic interpretation) shows little real agitation or annoyance and, in fact, frequently seems fond of his wife in a somewhat benevolently distracted sort of way.  Likewise, Mrs. Bennett appears in this version to be almost reasonably distracted over the prospect of marrying off five daughters as opposed to Jane Austen's original, who is at turns irritable, giddy, indiscreet and given to dealing with the events of her life with hypochondriac swoons.  Even more notably, Darcy himself is portrayed by Daniel McFadyen not as haughty, aloof, imperious and unable to break out of the strictures of his upbringing and class but as unsure and confused.  Keira Knightley's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett is annoyingly shrill and giddy and reminds me of nothing more than the attitude with which the first women suffragettes wore pants (""Look at me!! Look at me!! Just look at how OUTSPOKEN I am!!""), but she is not the worst culprit here.  (McFadyen, I feel moved to add, is actually quite dishy and would probably make a terrific Heathcliff -- all that silent brooding that he does would be put to much better use -- but nobody does haughty better than Colin Firth.)Beyond the aforementioned horror of putting the Bennetts' homelife on a level with the Clampetts, I also object to some of the changes in setting (most dealing with Eliza and Darcy's meetings -- in the Grecian temple, in the rain, walking across the fields at dawn) as being mawkishly, screamingly melodramatic and unoriginal.The whole point of P&P; is how two people, bound by the class restraints and social conventions of their time, managed to surmount them -- NOT cast them off wholesale.  The plot of this story is inextricably entwined with its setting in a society with very strict codes of behavior, and to impose modern manners is not only jarring but destroys its very premise.I did give the movie one star on the merit of its cinematography and soundtrack, both of which were excellent.  I would have loved to love this film and was beyond disappointed that my initial reservations were proven well founded.  One wonders:  will an ""updated"" retelling of Gone With the Wind be next??"	1.0	Why mess with perfection??	2007-02-19	140	106	34

I know that Keira Knightley was nominated for best actress that year and I can see why.  She is amazing. I also think that Matthew MacFadyen brought just the right touch to his portrayal of Mr. Darcy.  He was sexy, dreamy, and sensitive.

My only criticism is that I wish it were a little longer and included a few more scenes that I thought were important in the development of the main characters' relationship.  While faithful to the book, it has fewer scenes and characters so that the film can fit into a 2 hour time slot. For those who are familiar with the book and the BBC version, you can easily fill in the missing scenes.  However, it would have been fun to have them in the movie. Still, I really enjoy this version.  I also recommend the BBC version as well.	4.0	Lovely film	2013-09-03	1	1	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1T4QZSEAPTA3E	Kathy Edens	I have to state that I didn't really understand why there was another adaptation of P&P; done so soon after the magnificant A&E;/BBC series with Firth and Ehle. I have so much loved that version that I watched this determined not to like it. I didn't hate it but compared to Firth and Ehle (and the entire cast of that version) I just couldn't reach the same appreciation for the newer version. It probably isn't fair to compare the cast of this one to the other, however I do. Charlotte Lucas looks like she is 12 instead of 27. Col Fitzwilliam is a pudgy military officer. Georgiana Darcy is played by the same girl who was Henry VIII's 5th wife and plays her as a valley girl just like she did in The Tudors instead of the shy girl portrayed in the book and in the BBC version. Mr. and Mrs. Gardner were also portrayed as rather shabby people even though they were affluent enough through his business to have a London house, carriages etc. Their children don't exist in this version - in fact, Mrs. Bennet proclaims they have no children - even though we know that they did. Even though a two hour movie can't support the same number of characters as the 5 hour version, the omissions are really egregious.I did feel that probably this version was more historically accurate with the depiction of the Bennet house and the village...much more drab and rustic. Piles of manure on the roads and paths, sloppier animal pens etc. But it did not make for more pleasurable viewing. While the Bennet's were not of the same wealth as Darcy or Bingley, they did not reside in the hovel surrounded by pig stys shown in this version. The family all dressed very dis-shelved and drab. Mrs. Bennet would never  allow her daughters to roam around barefoot and sloppy. If anything, she was always trying to behave and live in a higher class manner than their income supported. The house is dark and shabby even though it is an estate.Perhaps if I'd never seen the A&E;/BBC version, I might have appreciated this one more, however I don't think I would have the same appreciation for the story. I don't think Jane Austin would be proud.	1.0	Grittier rendition	2011-05-09	7	4	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3DETIDW9K7YFL	Katress	I am a huge P & P fan (read it countless times, own about 175 variations/ sequels on my Kindle, have watched every film adaptation, have paraphernalia declaring my adoration) and I love this movie.  The movie captures the romantic feel of P & P's essence through its cinematography, pacing, direction, music and acting.  I love the long shot of the Netherfield Park ball, the continuity of the theme song throughout the movie, and the sizzling chemistry between the protagonists.  Keira Knightley, though more giggly than I interpreted Elizabeth to be, is more youthful and refreshing than her predecessors.  Matthew McFadden, is my quintessential Mr. Darcy (sorry Firth): regal in stature, appropriately haughty, and ruggedly handsome (but not gorgeous) with crystal blue eyes that emit vulnerability and passion and a deep baritone voice exudes masculinity and sexiness.  Yes, the movie is not faithful to the book or even Regency England norms so I understand why Austen purists get annoyed but the interpretations enable the movie to capture P & P's romance in a condensed two hours.  Overall, I love this movie and need to watch it once every couple of months to get my P & P fix.	5.0	This P & P fan loves it!	2014-03-30	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A12BUCD9446JED	kayak queen	This well-paced adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved classic is a delight.  Kiera Knightley (Bend it Like Beckham, Pirates of the Carribean) rightfully earned Oscar, BAFTA, Golden Globe and other major award nods for best actress in her portrayal of Miss Elizabeth Bennett, a girl who becomes a woman as she and her at-odds romantic interest, Mr. Darcy, overcome their pride and prejudices against each other in the backdrop of 1797 England.Joe Wright, emerging star in the world of film, conveys all the lively spirit, comedy, and romance, of the book, in this carefully crafted cinematic masterpiece.  Music lovers will find special appreciation in the soundtrack that includes many specially commissioned pieces that were written in the style of the period in which the film was set and which work as an integral part of the story.  Use of many outstanding locations around England are employed to illuminate the story.  Of particular interest to me was the actual wealthy gentleman's manor used for Longbourne, the Bennett home.  Unlike previous adaptations which portrayed the Bennetts inacurately as having great wealth, this version more closely matched the book in that the location did portray a gentleman's home, but not a notably wealthy gentleman.  Details are so carefully adhered to that subsequent viewings are necessary to take in all the interesting items in the background of many scenes.  However, because the director was working with such an excellent script and cast, the story is easy to follow even for people who may have never read the book.Casting in this film draws from the elite of British Theater with the result being strong fresh portrayals of the characters.  I had not even heard of Matthew Macfadyen prior to seeing this film but was immediately struck with how articulate he was in conveying the thoughts and emotions of Mr. Darcy with careful understated gestures, not simply relying on facial expression as many modern actors are prone to do. Tom Hollander turns in his best performance to date as Mr. Collins.  Dame Judy Dench is wonderful as the despicable Lady Catherine.Having enjoyed Austens works for years and several earlier adaptations of this book I was hopeful that this one would not disappoint.  It didn't!!!  My 1995 adaptation now sits in a corner gathering dust.  My boyfriend who NEVER liked the 1995 adaptation (far too slow...5 hours and felt like 9), actually enjoyed this adaptation very much and said it is a film he would enjoy seeing again.Watching this film I think you will quickly see why it received so much critical and audience acclaim, why it was nominated and earned so many awards, and why so many people have been pleased to add it to their DVD collections as a film they can look forward to viewing again and again.	5.0	A terrific adaptation of a beloved classic!!!!!	2006-10-08	12	6	6
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2P0CHR2KVAY47	"Kayla P. ""The Magnificent"""	This was a horrible movie, not just because of the numerous hisorical inaccuracies, but because of the wooden, bimbo-ish acting of Kiera Knightley. I do not understand why the director chose to make the Bennetts out to be paupers. A family of such low status would NEVER have mixed with higher society such as the Bingleys or Darcys. Also, Englishmen of the time would NOT have appreciated the common, casual manners of the actors. There is one scene of Keira Knightley flopping on a couch,and while watching it I just wanted to cry. Also, in the book, Jane was the prettiest of the Bennett girls, while in the movie she looks kind of freakish. I think this is a sad example of politically correct re-writing of history to remove the sense of class differences. The dinner free for all was a total joke. Anyone even remotely familiar with proper English manners would understand that if a family ate like that they would have been on the VERY bottom rungs of society. Mr. Darcy as portrayed in this movie looks continually like he's in need of a hug, and is not the proud character that Firth so brilliantly brought to life in the BBC version. The idea of pigs and dogs running throughout the house, of the Bennetts not owning a carriage was absurd. Don't get me wrong, I could see how a modernization of this story could be quite well done, but this ain't it.	1.0	Give me a break	2007-03-20	36	20	16

For example, the dance sequences and the roving camera-work show vignettes with key characters that would take much verbal exposition to explain.The scenery is breathtaking.  The Bennet farm is fascinating.I also didn't think anyone could be better than Colin Firth, but I am now a fan of Matthew Macfayden because of this film. He comes on slowly but intensely.

How can a 2 hour movie possibly capture the wonder of this book? Well, it can and it can't. I enjoyed it as simply another adaption of this Jane Austen classic. It wasn't better than the BBC versions, but on its own merit, it was good. Keira Knightley makes a GREAT Elizabeth Bennett, and Darcy is a bit more sympathetic and soft than the other Darcys. I was also turned off by the ""sexy"" reviews, but I wouldn't have used those words. There was chemistry...that's how I'd describe it. I didn't understand the scene with the statues and their nudity...what was the point? And there were other liberties taken.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1ORXZNT3TVHCC	Keats	"The HD DVD version was purchased.My wife is thoroughly taken with this version of ""Pride & Prejudice."" As I've seen with other movies the high definition becomes secondary to a moving story and you will forget until you encounter scenes with equisite detailing such as the several parties and painterly images framing the characters on the screen. The movie feels too short at the end and I would've loved to see some of the depth in the original work. I do not begrudge the effort in the cinematic translation as the pacing was excellent and the settings were quite amazing. The acting had some uneven moments but again the story particularly if you're familiar with it, will carry you to the end. Highly recommended. And if you do like this sort of thing, try viewing it with the subbing as certain lines are easily missed and sometimes misunderstood on first viewing."	5.0	An Enjoyable Cinematic Version	2008-01-02	1	0	1

I wish that she had played Jane in the BBC miniseries, then the masterpiece would have been complete.  I didn't like how they portrayed Mrs. Bennett as a drunkard and Mr. Bennett so seriously, not showing the sense of humor he obviously had in the book.

I watched it again and found that I really loved it; I was pleasantly surprised!Having been an avid reader of all Jane Austen books and the happy consumer of each Jane Austen inspired film, I felt I was a moderate expert on the subject matter.  The film has a few problems, the hand holding before consent of marriage and the fact that some of the language is very ""un-Austen"" being a couple, but the filmmakers caught the essence of Lizzy and Mr. Darcy in a way that I have rarely seen.Kiera Knightley is actually good as Lizzy, she's a little too pretty for the part; yet it works.  And MacFadyen was amazing as Darcy.  He took a different direction than Firth and I like his better!  I can't believe I'm saying that but it's true!I think people should look at this film for what it is; an excellent interpretation of Pride and Prejudice.  No film will ever please everyone.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A14X9R4QBQZFIE	Kerri Williamson	As a firm fan of the 5 hour BBC 1995 P&P miniseries, I went to this movie version with some skepticism, but found that it was much better than I expected even while it seemed to lack somewhat for me in some respects. THE P&P is hard to live up to! All in all though, I enjoyed this movie version immensely and went back to see it again right away. In and of itself, it is a delightful version of the story and even compared, it stands up on its own as another interpretation and look at the characters and events of this prima Austen work. The more I watch this movie (as a pick me up at home alone or with family or friends, with my feet up and a favorite something to nibble or sip on), the more I adore it. Let's face it; we can get our P&P fix faster/easier: in 2 hours instead of 5! (I still MUST watch the 5 hour version regularly as well.) This film version has a grittier, lowlier feel (perhaps a more realistic one) at the Bennet's and beyond, plus a more opulent contrast at Pemberly and related. One key detail that impressed me greatly was how I did not like Darcy nor see any attraction to the man at the beginning (how could HE be Darcy?!), but over time, he became more and more sympathetic (even appearing a pathetic figure at times: pitifully sunk in unrequited love - which pulled fully at my feelings to cheer him on in Elizabeth's direction) and attractive as the character - and this was as it should be. The performance of this actor made me want to see more of his work (and I have since seen him do extremely well in another role as a spoiled drunken dandy in `The Way We Live Now'.) The world needs more of this type of `old fashioned' movie.	5.0	Another Favorite!	2006-10-18	14	9	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1SA1OZ2A0ZYDJ	Kerry	First off I would like to state that I am an avid Jane Austen fan, her novels are my favourites. Secondly i would declare that I am not a person who expects a movie adaptation of a book to exceed the book itself. I believe it to be impossible to ever do a book justice on film (which is why i would always reccomend reading books before watching the films). As to this particular adaptation of Pride and Predjudice I found it to be a beautifully made film and the performances where outstanding by all. I could not help as always to love Elizabeth Bennett and could neither help but fall completely in love with Mr Darcy. At first glance Mr Darcy seems not at all as proud as expected but on further viewing I believe it to have simply been subtly done. I would reccomend this film to anyone as it is a real heart opener. Reguardless of opinions and comparisons I found that the film told the story of Pride and Predjudice most respectfully.I loved it from start to finish!	5.0	Beautiful film	2010-07-13	2	1	1

I remember hearing that they weren't sure whether they'd have her as Elizabeth because she was too pretty for the role, and that would have been a tragedy, b/c she's perfect in this.  As for her co-star Matthew Macfadyen who **IS** Mr. Darcy- I'm practically speechless.

I do love Keira Knightley's acting and I felt she played Elizabeth Bennet rather well in this movie. However, as a Jane Austen classic, this is not the best. I would definitely recommend the 1995 mini-series first, but seeing as that one is 310 minutes long, this one will work for your Jane Austen 'fix'. =)Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)	3.0	Good, but not Amazing.	2010-01-17	4	2	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A13TAD6IMRLJUN	"K. Hurlbut ""Tiffany Randall"""	I don't care if this film is `faithful' to its literary source.  I've never read Jane Austin, nor seen the much-touted BBC miniseries, so I'm fortunate enough to view this film on its own merits.This is an excellent film with wonderful cinematography and a slightly gritty, realistic setting.  The camerawork is elegant and almost Wellesian in its graceful fluidity.  (Such a relief from the normal hyper-MTV editing that presupposes we all have attention deficit disorder!)  The acting, in general, is excellent.  I found the Darcy character to be somewhat bland, or cipher-like, but that reflects probably on the material and not MacFayden's performance (though hard to tell if I haven't read the book).  Maybe it's better to have a blank screen in which to project female desires upon?Ms. Knightley gave a wonderful performance.  Very likeable, passionate and intelligent.  Passionate, in the sense of expressing all her feelings, not just romantic-love yearnings.  She will have an interesting career.  Ms. Knightley displays a wonderful personality on talk shows and seems oblivious to her natural beauty.  She was wonderful in `Bend It Like Beckham' playing a bit of a tomboy, and can obviously play more refined (and costumed) characters with equal charm.  The only thing that can prevent her from becoming the most popular actress in the world within five to seven years is if female moviegoers are more threatened by her beauty than sympathetic to the characters she plays.Final note:  The coda scene.  The producers did not show this scene in England and obviously rate the average English intelligence or taste higher than our American ones.	4.0	A Star is Born	2006-01-15	5	4	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	"Out of all Jane Austen's literary works Pride and Prejudice is the novel most people identify with her.  It is a story similar to many other masterpieces, as it tells a story of love.  Yet, it is so much more than a mere love story that unites aching hearts.  It brings out the strong patriarchal traditions and social class system that governs the society at the turn of the century between the 18th and 19th century.  Aristocratic women at this time avoided physical labor while prudently sitting still much like well-trained lap dogs in order to attract a proper suitor with high social status, wealth, and refined etiquette.  Thus, love was something secondary, as marriage provided the means for a woman to function with some freedom within in a society with intricate and rigorous rules.  Austen thought differently, and subtly assaulted the establishment with eloquent wit and delicate humor in her tour de force.Joe Wright is not the first director to attempt to provide a cinematic version of Austen's celebrated novel.  Two handfuls of adaptations have retold the story of Pride and Prejudice, yet Wright succeeds in delivering one of the best.  He remains true to the novel (despite its short format), while also capturing the social atmosphere in a genuine manner.  Besides applying the proper etiquette in a convincing manner, Wright makes sure that the film also looks authentic through details of muddy hems and the real class difference between people emerges through the actors' costumes.  Wright also enhances the storyline with breathtaking scenery ranging from dewy dawns at the edge of the forest to death springing cliffs, which helps to artistically reveal the emotional and social situation of the moment.  Much of this is also thanks to the terrific cinematography in the film by Roman Oshin.The opening shot displays the sun emerging above the tree line while the song of birds accompanied by a lone piano aurally enhance the scene.  The dawning obviously suggests in a symbolic way of a new beginning, as Pride & Prejudice is about to take its course.  In the very next shot, Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Bennet (Keira Knightley) wanders a meadow while finishing a book.  The contrasting elements in these two sequential scenes provide a slight hint toward Lizzy's delicate rebelliousness, which is augmented by her sisters tendency to remain at home while she gladly roam the outdoors by herself.  The slight social disobedience that Lizzy possesses presents the major reason why the story takes place at all, as all other female characters around them follow the traditional rules that govern them.Lizzy's footsteps lead her home where the story quickly begins to take form, as it becomes known that Mr. Bingley (Simon Wood) has arrived to the Netherfield Park and he collects a substantial annual income.  Along with the wealth he has a high-ranking social status and is single.  The mother Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) rapidly begins to plan for her daughters to meet the gentleman, as her lot in life is to make sure that her daughters get married.  Meanwhile, her husband, Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland), leisurely goes about his business to study plants and insects, as all five of his daughters are preparing to meet the gentleman.  It is yet another subtle illustration of males' acquired superior status due to a chromosome that eventually makes them men.As the story unfolds, Mr. Bingley falls in love with Jane Bennet (Rosamund Pike) and he begins to court her.  At the same time, Lizzy finds her heart crushed by Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) who plays the status card against her, and Lizzy decides to hate him for all eternity.  Ellizabeth also learns about a family secret between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend), which only increases her contempt for Mr. Darcy.  In the process, Elizabeth learns that Mr. Bingley has abandoned his pursuit for Jane's heart and hand.  Amidst of all this, Elizabeth also declines (something unheard of at the time) a marriage with her wealthy and distant cousin.  Instead the cousin marries her best friend, and the plot continues to thicken when she is invited to stay with her friend, as she also meets Mr. Darcy again who seems to have an ulterior agenda.If the viewers have not read the book by Austen, the film will certainly present a deep appreciation for her literary cunningness.  The many side plots keep the audience intrigued while the focus follows whether the truly beloved will find one another.  Yet, underneath this overt love story, Austen presents a true image of a woman's lot in life, which Wright skillfully captures.  Another aspect that makes this story unique is its deep understanding of human cognition besides the social message, which shines through its profound use of generalizations, assumptions, and preconceived notions.  Many of the cast members help bring out the many qualities in the script in a brilliant manner with the performing highlights in Keira Knightley, Brenda Blethyn, and Donald Sutherland.  Keira Knightly received an Oscar nomination her part as Lizzy, but I feel that Brenda Blethyn was robbed from a supporting role nomination, as the energetically scheming mother.  In the end, Pride & Prejudice presents an adaptation worthy of Austen's literary dexterity, which entertains and offers contemplation to those who seek something meaningful."	5.0	Eloquent and Witty Adaptation of Austen's Tour de Force...	2006-03-04	11	9	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1DWDQZSWR7OMH	"Kimba Wawrzyniak ""kimbawaw"""	I had high hopes for this adaptation, hoping that despite the choices in casting, it would be a film of superb visual quality at the very least.  I was amazingly disappointed.  Not only are the performances lack-luster, at best (the exception being Dame Judi Dench who is always remarkable), the costuming was dreadful.  Half of the time I was cringing over the clothing of the wrong time period, and the other half noting clothing that was far beneath the station of the characters. The Bennett girls, and Darcy, always looked a disheveled mess, and Mr. Bingley was the only one with the appropriate hairstyle.  Had the performances been strong, I could have forced myself to overlook these technical flaws. Unfortunately we are left with an Elizabeth Bennett who has no strength, a Darcy who just always seems angry and never changes, and no development of the other characters or their relationships to one another.  The director was, obviously, relying on a viewer who was so familiar with the novel all of the pieces could be filled in your head, rather than on screen.  Overall, don't waste your time, get the 1995 BBC version instead, and enjoy a long, lovely afternoon.	1.0	Lacking in Every Way	2006-03-01	50	21	29

Every girl wants her own Darcy and if he looks like this Darcy does, you will dare any woman to make a pass at him!!  I love when movies kind of push the envelope just a bit with Austen's men and her beautiful heroines.  I think Matthew and Keira are beautifully matched together in this movie and bring the characters to life in a way that makes me want to know Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam personally.  With all Austen characters, I feel like that I am that girl in the story because Austen wrote stories that happened to real women.  Now, of course, we girls are looking for our Edward (Twilight fans, unite!!), but Darcy will always be our first love.  This is a must see if you are an Austen fan, just have heard of Austen, or just love hot men!!!

I love the attention to details, like the dishes on the table (shown as would appear naturally, not perfectly set), the lighting in the ballroom (candlelight), the gowns (not perfectly pressed).  Keira Knightly is a wonderful Elizabeth - witty, observant, happy and beautiful.  The countryside is unspoilt.  The story is represented much as the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version, but with tweaks in the screenplay.  I found the difference in words refreshing and it is a fresh view of an old favorite.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3GE934KFZ5EZ6	Kim Maddalozzo	The most important thing to say when concerning Pride and Prejudice is that there are many versions of the story, some are better than others.  Of course everyone, especially the devout Jane Austen fans will say that they best version of the story is the 1995 version with Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle.  I have to agree with them, it is the gold standard when it comes to Pride and Prejudice.I was convinced that I was going to hate this version.  At first I could not see Matthew Macfayden as Mr. Darcy, it just did not seem right to me.  Not to mention the fact that it would be a shorter movie so I felt that it probably would not do the book justice.  After the first time I watched it, I thought it was okay.  I found the dialogue fast-paced, and I thought they left some major scenes out. I also thought that people who were not familiar with the story might get confused as somethings were not explained very well or misleading.The second time I watched it, I don't know what happened but it all fell together better and it was like magic.  I fell in love with Matthew Macfayden as Mr. Darcy (he almost peaks Colin Firth in my opinion) and the chemistry he has with Keira Knightley is just electric.  From their first meeting, the atmosphere is so charged with it the audience can feel it. If you step away from the plot, and look at the movie by itself it just shines, even though they stray from the book how they present the story is just lovely, and maybe more relatible to us today.  My heart still flutters at the end of the movie in the early morning when Mr. Darcy comes to speak with Elizabeth again.  I find myself sobbing, even though I have watched it countless times.Even though, the 1995 version is the best made from the screenplay by Andrew Davies to the acting and costume this version starring Matthew Macfayden and Keira Knightley offers a different perspective to the story that is fresh and exciting and is well worth watching.	5.0	Fresh, Exciting	2011-01-03	2	2	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A36MY9WNHCAGI5	"Kimzonline ""Sm Biz Specialist"""	I am sorry, but I really cannot recommend this movie for what it is supposed to be- And that is Jane Austin's Pride & Predjudice.  I am a fan of Austin and of the era.  I am more than willing to accept literary license, and even enjoy different versions of the same story, but it took me 4 tries to sit through this movie until the end.Kneira Knightly is a beautiful women, but she absolutely is NOT Elizabeth. The movie is ok, if you know nothing about Austin, the book, or how the wealthy of that era act and what they will accept. In this movie, Elizabeth is portrayed as a women who appears unkept, sloppy, drab and more than pleased with herself when she slights a wealthy member of society-which is pure hogwash for a woman of her time-no matter how intelligent or sassy she is. Besides, what would Mr Darcy even find to be attracted to, especially strongly enough to cause a minor scandal in marrying her -she looks like a shapeless frump. She has an unexplained smile/smirk on her face most of the time-which is destracting, since it doesn't belong there. I was so disappointed in this movie- and I only made myself finish watching it, because I paid money for it.Go ahead and buy it if, as I said, you have never read Austin or do not know much about history.  You will enjoy it for what it really is. A chic flick that takes place in the early 1800's.	3.0	Don't expect Jane Austin	2006-08-27	14	9	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2KZ6W6ARZE4N6	KitKat	"I went to see this movie simply out of curiosity, for Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book, and I have never seen a movie adaptation of it before.  My goodness, I don't think the director could have mangled the story any better than if he had set out to do it.  There were many jarring factors, especially the inappropriate casting and the incomprehensible alterations of the original plot.My biggest annoyance with the movie was with the cast.  Mr. Bennett comes across as an old has-been hippie (complete with stringy unkempt hair and ill-fitting clothes) who dodders dazedly around his house and farm.  He didn't take much notice of things in the book either, but that was because he chose to ignore them, not because he was totally zoned out.  Mrs. Bennett is way too overdone and excessively silly.  Jane was sweet and beautiful, but was not allowed to fully develop her character on her own- an unwise omission, I thought, since Jane and Elizabeth are very close in the book and Jane is important in keeping the story flowing in several places.  Mr. Bingley- ugh!  He was wimpy and girlish, and I especially detested the vacant, silly look on his face.Of course, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are the most important characters, and sadly, the casting for them was no better.  Obviously, Keira Knightley interpreted Elizabeth as aggressive and rude rather than lively and witty.  She has a very unattractive habit of jutting out her jaw and spitting out angry words.  Rather than being proud and ""noble,"" Mr. Darcy is gloomy and cross.  I saw an interview in which Matthew McFadyen said ""Mr. Darcy was just shy.""  SHY??  Um, noooo..... maybe that's why the book is called PRIDE and Prejudice?!  The transformation of Mr. Darcy's character in the book never materialized in the movie; I think he might have smiled twice the whole time, toward the very end.  Watching Keira and Matt together, I wondered how the director possibly thought their behavior would convice audiences that they have fallen in love by the end of the movie.  What could Darcy see in a girl that glares, pushes her face into his and fairly gnashes her teeth at him?  And what could Lizzy see in a man who acts so dull and lifeless?The other jarring factors in the movie were the pointless twistings of the original scenes from the book, and the addition of scenes or elements that are nowhere in the book and never would have been.  For example, Lizzy goes to Pemberley (an art museum disguised as a country estate, it would seem) and spends several minutes contemplating marble statues.  Nude ones, I might add; I think they were old Greek gods.  The purpose of this long and boring scene is not clear, unless it was put in to satisfy the director's evident enjoyment of nudity.  All the big houses in the movie have enormous murals of nude figures, Pemberley has a huge art museum filled with marble ones, and back at Longbourn (the ""estate"" that somehow became a dirty, noisy farm in the movie) we are shown a full shot of a trotting pig's behind (and other things) that was completely pointless.  I also wasn't quite sure what the point was behind the ""Lizzy on top of the world"" scene, besides the pretty photography; or why she apparently spends a whole afternoon staring hollowly at herself in her mirror.  I could go on and on, but why, oh why, were important elements of the book left out, cutting big holes in the story, while many precious minutes were spent on long, artsy scenes that serve little purpose in the plot?And why were practically all the settings for scenes changed too, like Darcy proposing in the rain instead of in Charlotte's parlor? or Lady Catherine paying a visit to Elizabeth in the middle of the night? or Colonel Fitzwilliam whispering info about Darcy to Elizabeth during church rather than while they were out walking?  One thing that really became old, and then irritating, after awhile was the entire gigglesome Bennet family listening at closed doors every single time a private conversation was taking place.  Other reviewers have mentioned other transgressions against the social norms of the day, and I agree with all of them; I will add that the biggest one for me was Lizzy going for a pre-dawn walk in her nightgown.  As I had watched ""Pirates"" I have to admit that I fully expected that Keira Knightley would wander around in her nightgown at some point, and she didn't disappoint me there.  But there was a twist here; Mr. Darcy shows up in his nightshirt too!  I really don't believe people in those days strolled around the countryside without getting properly dressed first.Well, to sum it all up, I do not recommend this movie, particularly if you enjoy the book and, like me, expect movies to follow the book's plot and accurately portray its characters.  The only thing I liked at all about this movie was the music.  I suppose if you have not read the book, you will think the movie is pretty good, but I warn you that it is a very distorted, and inferior, version of the brilliant plot and captivating characters in the book."	1.0	What happened here??	2006-01-01	26	10	16
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2WBXFLHM7TPHW	kitty kat	This is truly an excellent film version of Pride & Prejudice.  The scenery is lush, inviting and magical. The actors are perfect in every way.  Keira Knightley brings a new freshness and charm to the character of Miss Elizabeth Bennet through her infectious laughter and fearlessness.  Matthew Macfadyen, as  Mr. Darcy, is distant, frosty, vulnerable  and attractive all at the same time. Their combined energy makes the movie real and believable.  It's easy to become invested in the story and its outcome.

I'm a fan of Jane Austen's books, partly because she seemed to be ahead of her times as concerns the rights of women (she didn't accept the 'place' they were caught in), and she wrote with such a sense of humor. Though I enjoyed the serial with Firth in it also, this 'take' caught her sense of humor, and I've never seen a woman deliver her lines for Elizabeth with such an impish glee as Keira Knightley gave. Yes, there were a few changes in the story...but on the whole I think Austen would have been pleased.It had been years since I'd seen Donald Sutherland play such a good part for him, and do it so well. You can see Elizabeth's frustration with her bookish father's inability to put his foot down to control his frivolous younger daughter. And it comes back to haunt him.It didn't hurt to have MacFayden play the handsome Darcy either, though I'd have a hard time choosing between him and Colin Firth.A great addition to the films from Austen's stories...	5.0	One of the most beautiful movies ever made.	2009-06-17	4	3	1

But once you get over this change to a realistic scene rather than one of grandeur and glitz set by past versions, the realization that the changes are for the better grow on you -- The characters are warmer, younger, and what I liked best about it was the change from the one dimensioned silliness of the mom in the BBC version --In the BBC version, you would wonder how one could be attached to so silly and horrid a woman there, but here, the family is portrayed with a warmth that makes the story much more real -- Lizzie's attachment to her family and their plight is more believable as coming from Love rather than just Duty.  And you can see the woman her father fell in love with and had 5 children with -- The biting relationship in the BBC series between the parents made me wonder how they ever had five children when he so clearly despised his wife.The sweaty lively assembly brought to life the energy in social dance.

Second, I found that the film had two most egregious errors that changed the heart and character of the book:First is the elimination of the Pemberly scene where Elizabeth sees the change in temparment of Darcy from proud to friendly and charming.  This with the letter is her true change in heart.  The movie makes the love seem more of an obligation for saving Lydia than having solidified prior to the incident.Second is the hack job of dialog making everything explicit.  What is wonderful about Austen is a comedy of subtle manners.  The minute Charlotte Lucas starts yelling at Lizzie, I realized that the spirit and charm of Austen had been lost.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A26KIF01GEUXBT	Kyle Pratt	"This adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel is one of the best to come out of Hollywood.Austen's novel begins with, ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.""  In Pride and Prejudice Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) supplies the prejudice.  The pride comes from Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) who finds Elizabeth attractive and intelligent but beneath him.  Miss Bennet finds Mr. Darcy a snob.  Both play their parts well.However, Jane Austen novels are set at a slower time and written for people who had the time to read them.  They are leisurely affairs to be read over days.  Therefore, no movie of 129 minutes can adequately capture the depth of her genius.  That is why I have always enjoyed the A&E;/BBC miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  While the miniseries did not have the budget of the movie, it had time, 300 minutes, to develop the plot.  Although the opening scene in the miniseries is not in Austen's novel, whole pages of text are presented verbatim.Another strength of the movie is the excellent cinematography.  The sets and scenes are exquisitely shot.  However, the movie has been criticized for making the Bennet family appear lower in class.  We are never sure from the novel exactly what Mr. Darcy found objectionable with the Bennet family.  I would say that the movie portrays the difference in class between the two families well.  Demonstrating this class difference might even be a weakness of the miniseries.  I am not bothered by the modernization of the dialogue, this helps the modern audience enjoy the movie, but what does bother me is the modernization of etiquette and morals.  Men and women of the time did not casually allow visitors in their bedrooms or when they were only partially dressed.I enjoy and study Regency and Victorian literature and have seen every Austen movie ever made and read her books.  I have both this movie and the miniseries in my collection and enjoy them both.  I have rated the movie four-stars in comparison to the A&E;/BBC miniseries.  For fans of Jane Austen, both are well worth watching.Kyle Pratt"	4.0	Superior Adaptation of Austen's Novel	2006-10-12	11	6	5

When P&P the 1995 series came out they said England (and especially London) had ""Darcy Fever"" because Colin Firth so captivated the masses with his smoldering performance.  That said, I really enjoyed watching this movie and even rewatched all my favorite parts, which, for me at least, is proof of an arresting piece of work.  The cast - notably - Keira Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen, Brenda Blethyn, and Donald Sutherland are the type you can't keep your eyes off of when they are on screen.  The manners weren't quite as stiff as portrayed in the series - you could see the familial love and there was actually some awkwardness in Darcy which made the characters warmer and more accessible.

The country pastoral scenes were absolutely beautiful!

It is more than a love story----that's why men will like this movie--it is a picture--a ""snap"" in the camera of time of the constant worry of having enough money, of wealth, of position, of high character and low; but also of truth, honesty, patience, lying, deception and manipulation.But the higher virtues of truth, forgivness and love win out over the baser virtues (light is stronger than darkness), and that is why this story is a ""classic"" and shall remain so for generations.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A6F01WDKEZ4Z4	Lajezza	"The writers for the film have done a good job at adapting the famous ""Pride and Prejudice"" novel written by Jane Austen, into a short 2-hour film (I say this in comparison to the 6+ hour BBC series). Needless to say, some of the original meaning and conversations are omitted or altered in the film, or placed in different settings/scenes in order to give audiences as much of the original and full meaning provided in the book. Overall, I think this is done quite well.The Bennett household is a family of colourful characters, the most sensible of which are Lizzy and her sister Jane. Like any normal family, they are not exempt from their fair share of dramas - some of which, pose a threat to the happiness of Lizzy and her family's social-standing.In Lizzy's initial encounter with Mr Darcy, she vows to ""loathe him for all eternity"", and yet as fate would have it, events lead their paths to cross time and time again, and both must overcome their pride and prejudices in order to find true felicity."	4.0	Classic lovestory	2011-10-27	1	1	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3PG5OOL13ETRA	"L. Andrews ""Austen Fan"""	"WARNING:  Plot points exposed in the following review...As a tremendous fan of the 1995 BBC miniseries I was curious as to how well the story would fare in a mere 127 minutes (versus the 300 minute miniseries behemoth).  Though seemingly rushed in places (there are plot points that could have done with more exposition - the character of Lydia Bennet being the most glaring example of this), I was pleasantly surprised!  Many (including myself) consider the BBC miniseries to be the definitive adaptation of Jane Austen's most popular novel, and as such it is impossible not to compare any newcomers to it.  Happily, this film stands up on its own.  At the beginning of the film, I found myself instinctively comparing the two on a line-by-line basis.  I soon found myself simply enjoying this adaptation.  It is small wonder then that Emma Thompson, whose marvellous adaptation of Sense & Sensibility garnered her a Golden Globe, had a hand in revising this screenplay (though she is uncredited for her efforts).  The script shines with her wit.The world of the Bennet family is far grittier than the BBC miniseries, the producers of which made a conscious decision to focus on the family in a sort of benign vacuum rather than placing them in the social context of the times.  The resulting reality of the film characters' lifestyle with pigs wandering to and fro in the yard brings the plight of the Bennet girls into sharp focus.  They simply MUST marry well lest they end farmer's wives with no servants and working themselves into early graves.  Or worse yet, poor single women once they are turned out of their home by Mr. Collins, obliged to depend on the kindness of others in Merryton.The always pleasing Keira Knightley does a lovely job as Elizabeth Bennet.  Rather than portraying her as shockingly pessimistic, she is simply the only member of the Bennet family (save perhaps Mr. Bennet) that does not go through life with blinders on.  Her performance as the conflicted heroine has won her Golden Globe and Oscar nominations, and deservedly so.  Matthew MacFadyen imbues his Darcy with a humanity that makes Colin Firth's Darcy seem wooden in comparison.  Darcy's inward struggle of wills is delicately portrayed with only fleeting glimpses of his utter agony amid the expected reserve of the upper class.  Speaking of wooden, however,  Rosamund Pike's portrayal of the angelic Jane leaves you wanting.  Her ""reserve"" as they called it, was a bit overplayed and resulted in a less than sympathetic character.  While Jena Malone does not come remotely close to bringing the bratty self-centeredness of Lydia to her scant screen time.  Had I not been so familiar with the character's innumerable flaws, I might have found myself wondering why she would have been so stupid as to go off on her infamous elopement.  To me, this is the major shortfall of this adaptation.  The elopement is the stomach-sickening climax of the novel, and much of the build-up to Lydia's downfall is omitted as is much of the search for the wayward Lydia.  The result is that the viewer is not as aware of how and why she would do such a thing nor truly the extent of the consequences of her actions.  Brenda Blethyn does an admirable job of portraying Mrs. Bennet as an overbearing, pushy mother without taking on the unbearable shrillness of the miniseries Mrs. Bennet.  Donald Sutherland, though I thought him an unusual choice for Mr. Bennet, is able to convey the guilt and shame that Mr. Bennet carries for not providing adequately for his daughters' futures all the while remaining oddly sympathetic.  Dame Judi Dench was the perfect selection for the imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  However, she is much nastier than the miniseries version - to an uncomfortable extent.  Rather than being simply demeaning in that unconscious way that high-born people of her era were to others below their rank, she resorts to out-and-out cruelty.  Unneccesarily, I might add (though this is a shortfall of the screenplay, not Dame Judi).In all, this version of the classic tale is remarkably well done, most especially in the development of the relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.  It is in the interactions of these two characters that the heart and soul of the movie resides; in two people so obviously perfect for each other that neither can see it."	4.0	Delightful Adaptation with Minor Flaws	2006-03-13	13	10	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2T049UQONS0OY	Larry VanDeSande	"This film adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is certain to become a classic. It is equisitely filmed in the English countryside in an authentic century English home, wonderfully acted by a delightful and scrupulously chosen cast, beautifully produced and directed with resplendent art direction and costumes, and features Dario Marianelli's Oscar-nominated original score that is consistently endearing to the ear, mind and senses.Keira Knightley, one of England's best actors, plays Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, an Englishwoman of dubious breeding that nonetheless is headstrong, opinionated, domineering and silly. She makes good and bad decisions and is smart enough to change her mind about the bad ones. The story revolves around Lizzy and her four sisters, her parents, the royal beau that will become her husband, and members of his family. A splendid supporting cast including Donald Sutherland, Judi Densch and Jean Malone forms the foundation for Knightley's electric performance in the lead role.Jane Austen (1775-1817) was a peer of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) and lived during the crossover from the Classical to Romantic eras in music, art and literature. Her half-dozen novels form the basis for the comedy of manners in England's class society of the 1700s. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is said to be the most romantic book ever written. Even through the script varies from the novel's storyline, this memorable film adaptation mirrors the wit, humor, empathy, love, jealousy and realism of family dynamics portrayed in Austen's novel.A cherry on top is provided by Jean Thibeaudet's rapturuous piano playing in the original score, the best film score I've heard since ""The Pianist"". While the influence of early Beethoven is clear in the main theme and much of the score is authentic to the period, some of the music is too romantic and belongs to the mid-1800s. This and other minor blemishes aside, this is a remarkable film treatment of a classic novel that provides romance, humor, wonder and satisfaction.

It is by far my favorite adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (and I've seen all the available versions except the Mormon one- 1940, 1980, 1995, and Bride and Prejudice). This movie is very realistic in that it portrays how unclean times were back then (no, it's not dirty or gross or anything, don't worry). Perhaps the filmmakers went a little too far in the case of the Bennet house, but that was done to contrast their situation to those of Darcy and Bingley.The casting is excellent. I was hesistant about Keira Knightley at first (I'd only seen a couple of her other movies and liked her in Bend it Like Beckham), but her Lizzy blew me away. She portrayed the arch, outspoken side of Lizzy as well as her sweet, unoffending nature. She also really showed the character's youth. Matthew McFayden's Darcy was totally different from any interpretation I've seen (shy, puppydog) but I couldn't call it inaccurate. He and Lizzy really have chemistry together. Brenda Blethyn was an amazing Mrs. Bennet- she is annoying and embarrassing but believable not over-the-top. Rosamunde Pike is the beautiful Jane I have been waiting for. None of the other Janes I've seen are even as pretty as Lizzy. Some of the changes people might not like (but that I love)- Bingley is more of a goof, Caroline is a little meaner, Mary is prettier, and Mr. Bennet a more caring father (this one did bother me a little).On top of the great cast, the cinemotography is breathtaking, the music is beautiful, it uses a lot of Austen's own dialogue (but changes some of it slightly), and it's also hilarious.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2927XB76PCSQC	Lauren M. Good	First, I think the actors did a find job with their roles; my issue is with the directorial decisions that made no sense. I had no problem with how the Bennett family was portrayed, and I even liked the rougher more unwashed look of the dancers at the minor balls -- in a world where bathing was a luxury, I can imagine that flyaway hair would be more natural than perfectly coiffed locks.The pacing was much too fast. I realize that it's a lot of story to fit into 2 hours, which is why it perhaps should not have been attempted. Today's life moves at breakneck speeds, but life in the nineteenth century would have been much slower, especially for families of their status.I do not understand the re-characterization of Mr. Bennett at all. In the book he's a quietly powerful figure stuck in a loveless marriage. When he speaks to Elizabeth at the end, he mentions the unhappiness of marrying someone you cannot respect, a direct allusion to his own situation. This movie portrays him as hen-pecked and even shows tenderness to his wife -- completely out of character with the original where he barely tolerates her silliness. To bolster this illustration of Mr. Bennett, some of his best lines are given to other roles. For example, Elizabeth challenges Mr. Collins as to whether his effusions are thought out ahead of time or the result of the moment. Elizabeth would never be so impertinent to a guest at her father's table, especially one with the power to put them out of their house!And lastly, Lady Catherine came calling in the middle of the night? I think not! There is nothing on earth that would have provoked a woman of such strict pride and ostentatious rectitude to arrive at the home of someone so far beneath her in the dark of night. It would be unheard of.If you don't care about the original story or its integrity and/or just want to get through it, please feel free to watch this. But if you want to know the real story, please read the book or watch the BBC production with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.	1.0	Actors good, creators bad	2006-12-08	27	18	9

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"Like most people who love literature I was well aware that Jane Austen could write, but the idea that Keira Knightley can act and hold her own against the likes of Dame Judi Dench was a revelation.  Granted, Knightley has not particularly been called upon to turn in great acting performances in most of her films.  In ""Love Actually"" she is basically required to look pretty and her best moments are reaction shots rather than dialogue.  She has many more moments such as that in ""Pride & Prejudice,"" but she also proves herself proficient at the witty dialogue.  Knightley filmed this version as her final film as a teenager and the results are comparable to when Franco Zeffirelli cast the teenage Olivia de Hussey in ""Romeo & Juliet.""This becomes the most romantic version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" because we are not surprised along with Lizzie when Darcy shows up and makes the most backhanded proposal of marriage in the history of Western literature.  The screenplay by Deborah Moggach (Emma Thompson receives special thanks in the credits, apparently for script doctoring) makes one significant change in the proceedings by simply having the moment when Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) falls for Lizzie clearly written on his face.  At the Meryton ball she finds the perfect moment to throw the callous words that she has overheard back into his and with the rapier still skewering her victim she turns on her heels and walks away in triumph.When next he sees her she has walked over to Mr. Bingley's house to care for her sister Jane (Rosamund Pike), who has been taken ill because of the matrimonial machinations of their mother.  Lizzie's hair is down and she is positively glowing.  When we see the look of Darcy's face it is clear that he is beyond smitten, even though through the veneer of upper class manners the signs are decidedly subtle.  From that moment on his affection becomes transparent to us, although Lizzie is surprised to learn of its existence.  Joe Wright also creates a motif where the first time Darcy and Lizzie touch, as he helps her into a carriage, resonates by an emphasis at key moments throughout the film of Darcy's hands.Elizabeth Bennett is the most delightful of the Austen heroines because she has the virtue of not backing down.  Indeed, I believe Darcy first takes real notice of her because she stands up to him at the ball.  When she refuses to back down from Lady Catherine De Bourgh (Judi Dench) at the dinner table it struck me that one of the reasons she is so attractive to Darcy is because she is not trying to be.  Certainly Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blythen) has taught her five daughters it is how to be on their best behavior to catch a husband, and in a world of such propriety her candor is refreshing.  Darcy's curt dismissal of her looks as being tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt him, becomes ironic because for my money it is her brains that make Elizabeth Bennett a real beauty both to him and to us.The screenplay necessitates cutting much of the action to reduce the tale to a two-hour film.  I appreciated being spared the unfortunate incident of Mary at the pianoforte as well as the constructed scene for the final fadeout and my only minor complaint would be that Lady Catherine does not utter her exit line from the novel when she takes her leave of Elizabeth in their final confrontation although I fully understand that the words cannot be uttered under those circumstances and the fact that Lady Catherine shows up immediately on hearing the rumor makes up for being denied the pleasure of hearing Dame Judy declaim that line.I had heard that the Jane Austen Society was less than pleased by Knightley's posture in this film, but one of the strengths of this production is that the Bennetts clearly live in the country.  There are dirt roads that lead to their home, where a large hog wanders through the front door, and when Mr. Darcy and the Bingleys make their first appearances at the local ball the dancing has an exuberance (not to mention slapping of hands) that makes it patently clear that we are far from the hallowed halls of Pemberly or the civilized life of London.  But the outside locations are as sumptuous as the gilded rooms in this film, and cinematographer Roman Osin makes both look gorgeous.For those who consider ""Sense & Sensibility"" to be the current cinematic benchmark for Austen adaptations I can report that ""Pride & Prejudice"" is its superior in terms of both romance and comedy by virtue of both crying and laughing more at this 2005 film..  Where Ang Lee's 1995 film comes out ahead is in its depiction of sisterhood, as Jane and Lizzie cannot rival Elinor and Marianne in their bonds of affection, which is understandable since it is more central to that Austen novel.  Even so there is a cute moment of confidences shared beneath the covers and Lizzie's spirited defense of her sister's shyness.  However, this one really is all about Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.I am not at all surprise that Kngihtly received a Best Actress nomination for her performance in this film.  As is invariably the case with such films the cast of supporting players is superb.  Brenda Blethyn's Mrs. Bennett is comically painful, but Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett has a touching final scene with his daughter, Tom Hollander is toadally obnoxious as Mr. Collins, and my wife really wants to slap Jenna Malone's Lydia a couple of times.  The best thing I can say about this version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" is that I went back to the theater to see it again, and the only other movie I did that for was ""Revenge of the Sith"" (I was using it for class).

The films based upon it strive to deserve its title. Cinema and literature are two very different forms of creative expression, and I believe that it is impossible for any film to completely capture Austen's genius of Pride and Prejudice. Yes, the BBC miniseries was excellent. This film is better. By not trying to ""be"" the book, but ""be"" the characters, this version of Pride and Prejudice brings new emotions that the BBC miniseries missed. I was never swept away by the miniseries; I love it, but it did not make me wish to be Lizzy, as the novel, and now this wonderful film, does.

Conway	"Yet another re-release DVD, promising more special features when any regular fan, like myself, already has the first DVD release.About this DVD:1st Disc: Is the exact DVD released prior to this one. It has the widescreen movie version and all the same features on the previous DVD release.2nd Disc: This is the new disc with ""extra"" special features including...-Fullscreen movie version.-""The Politics of Dating"" - A short feature with cast, crew, and director talking about modern vs. P&P; time dating (i.e. dancing, the 'touch', etc).  Most of the interview clips are recycled from what we've previously seen on the first disc special features. And brought little to nothing new to the table and lasted around 7 minutes.-""Galleries of the 19th Century"" - Interactive photo gallery. Fun.-""The Stately Homes of Pride and Prejudice"" - A small handful of about 5 minute interviews with cast, crew, and director talking about the different locations they worked at. New stuff, but nothing exceptionally interesting that lasts for long.-""Pride and Prejudice Family Tree"" - A DVD menu telling us how the characters in the movie are related. It is pointless and useless, nothing interesting or new.-And that's IT.Packaging:It's absolutely gorgeous. I think all the money was spent on the box rather than putting together a decent 2nd disc. The package is made to look and open like a book. It's a great, beautifully designed set that is hard to resist if you saw it in stores.Booklet:A booklet was included in this set with some new, unseen photographs and talk about costumes, characters, and music. It's basically like a scrapbook of images and tidbits of various cast and crew's thoughts.Included:The soundtrack is included in a paper sleeve along with a ticket for director Joe Wright's upcoming film Atonement.Conclusion: If you were hoping for new interviews with the cast and director, unseen behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, or anything worth shelling out more money to buy another DVD for, then you will be severely disappointed. If you're like me, and already own both the movie and soundtrack this really isn't worth the $28 buy. Because ultimately you're just getting just a pretty box, another copy of the DVD you already own, and a throwaway extra disc.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A37ZCH7NAOTC6L	"L E Field ""readerlain"""	"I first read Pride & Prejudice at the ripe old age of 9.  In the last 45 years I have read and reread all of Austen's works many times and can be considered something of an Austen authority.  It is risky to try to translate a written work so well known and loved as Pride & Prejudice to a visual medium, but there are folks who can't resist the challenge.  I've seen a few other attempts and must  praise the 2 disc BBC version (with Colin Firth et al) for its beauty and adherence to the text.  Others criticized it for not being as good as much older versions.  Some even faulted that the principals were not sufficiently beautiful or handsome.Comparatively, I felt this film was much more true to the 'facts' set forth in the text, if not to the text itself.  The Bennett women were  appropriately young.  The younger ones were in character and giggly.  Mr. Darcy seemed a bit young to me--not convincingly 30, but very convincingly reservewd.I fully expected to be critical of this effort, and couldn't see how anyone could have another view of the story worth putting forth. s But these producers and writers don't pretend to be true to Austen.  They shift the perspective to her characters.  This P & P shows life more as it might have been in the times about which Austen wrote.  Fans of regency romance are familiar with the term 'crush' as in, ""The ball was expected to be the usual crush"" (of people).  The dance sequences and balls evoke that very well. Portrayals of home life are also very much more 'realistic'.  Costumes are not as elaborate or as varied.  Sets are more believable--these are interiors to match the status of their owners.  And the sets and scenes and costumes do not draw attention from the actors' work.  The camera focuses on the characters and their facial expressions.This version humanizes the characters:  The men are not smooth sophisticates.  The women are not either buffoons or sophisticates.  The mother's relations with her daughters are more maternal than is evident in other versions or in the original text.  And in this film, the father is a much more sympathetic figure -- more in tune with his wife (foibles nothwistanding) and children.  It is clear he cares for them even as he feels clearly outnumbered by all these women.  But he is not bad tempered about it. Nor does he feel he has made a mistake in marrying a young woman with more beauty than good sense. The Neterfield ball shows him comforting the daughter he had to discipline, and coming to his wife's aid to fan her in the crush of guests.Most all the men come across as males (a common criticism of Austen's portrayals of men is she has no concept of the real thoughts or behaviors of men)--Collins is sexually frustrated, Bingley is tongue tied, and Darcy of course is smoldering, but his shyness comes across more clearly than in any previous portrayals, including the text.  It overrides his hauteur.In short, I didn't plan to like this.  As an Austen fan I should feel outraged at the rewriting of so many of her characters and the cutting out altogether of others.  But where this movie does not imitate art, it does infuse life into the tale and its characters.  The departure was a very bold move and a risky one.  It works.  For that reason alone it deserves 5 stars, but it is also a lovely effort."	5.0	Surprisingly good -- better than expected	2006-03-20	21	16	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3UN3MTKFTHUTQ	"Leslie Truex ""Work-At-Home Success"""	I don't quite understand the negative reviews. Its not perfect, but it does really good job with the essence of the story given the time restraint. To do the story in the book requires more time (see BBC 6 episode version...which is also good). Creating a movie from this book requires some interpretation as we don't really get into Darcy's head. Plus the book often has narrative and not dialogue at key points, requiring screen writers to fill in what the characters would have said. Its interesting to see how the different movie versions (there was an old one with Lawrence Oliver, an 80's version, the BBC Colin Firth version and this one) deal with those narrative sections that needed dialogue.  I can see the complaint about Keira's portrayal being tomboyish, but I found it refreshing compared to other portrayals. Her Elizabeth did seem more frank and forward with her opinion (character traits of Elizabeth). In other versions the actresses said Elizabeth's words, but they didn't really exuded the essence of Elizabeth. I also thought the Bennett home and attire better showed the class distinction between the Bennetts and Darcy than other movie versions. The class distinction as well as the Bennett family's behavior are why Darcy initially objects to Elizabeth. I do love Colin Firth's Darcy, but I thought Matthew did a great job as well. I love the end when he walks across the field and stutters his feelings (which is different from the book, but I love it anyway). My impression of Darcy from the book was that aside from his station (which would make him proud) he was also shy. There are several passages in the book in which he talks about not feeling socially adept. I thought Matthew showed that part of Darcy well. I do wish it was more like the book (especially at Pemberly) but that would have been a longer film. If you don't know the book, I could see how it would be hard to see how these two could fall in love based on the interaction seen in the movie. More focus to Darcy/Elizabeth scenes from the book would have helped. I did like the last scene (in US version) a great deal and wished Austin had ended with a scene between Darcy and Elizabeth at Pemberly.	5.0	I keep watching over and over...	2009-12-15	3	2	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2704YHE7JJCOK	"L. Graham ""Book Lov'r"""	I've read Jane Austin's Pride & Prejudice twice, seen the A&E; mini-series with Colin Firth (love him!) and I've now seen Pride & Prejudice 2005 (about four times in one week).  This is going to be a comparative between the mini-series and the movie.First of all, I think it is important to note that the mini-series is approx. five hours long and the movie is approx. half that.  This provides the mini-series with an advantage.  The mini-series is SO true to the book in just about every realm.  One has a chance to get to know the characters thoroughly and fall in love with Mr. Darcy right along with Lizzy.However, there is one major thing missing from the mini-series that the movie possessed:  PASSION!  Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy was bar none, but the young lady who played Lizzy (cannot recall her name at the moment) lacked the passion to match his own.  She also made Lizzy into far too serious a character.  In my opinion, she lacked the spunk that Lizzy had in the book.  Keep in mind, this was my opinion when I first watched the mini-series and watching the 2005 movie only made me far more aware of this opinion.  When Ms. Austin wrote Lizzy, she intended a character who was spunky, light hearted and very intelligent.  Ms. Knightly's portrayal of Lizzy matched what I had always imagined Lizzy being (and looking) like.Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfayden were by far breathtaking in the portrayals of their respective characters.  I was left breathless many times by the slight looks given by Matthew Macfayden and received by Keira Knightly.  Keira Knightly's performance of Lizzy's obvious hatred/affection for Mr. Darcy seeps through the screen into your own heart!  The passion of the 2005 movie version is undeniable!However, be aware that Hollywood did what Hollywood does best:  Fluffed it up and made it their own.  The mini-series version is so deep and involved with the original story line that it is totally engrossing.  However, the movie version brings the story to life with the passion and resonance that Ms. Austin intended.I would recommend watching both.  The mini-series for the depth of character development and strict storyline and the movie for the passion and moral awareness that this story was meant to portray.	5.0	Movie vs. Mini-Series	2006-05-10	24	18	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2HKRNELD7DGX1	Lili_K	"At the beginning of my review I'd like to state that I am a die-hard Jane Austen fan. P&P; is my favourite JA book. Naturally, I've seen all possible film versions and although the 2005 version is not the best, it's not the worst either.Almost everybody considers the '95 BBC version as the best, as the most authentic, so I would like to defend this version in comparison with the latter.Nobody in their right mind should expect a movie to cover everything in a book, I mean, 2 hours is not 6 hours, right? I am not saying that the script could not have been better, because that would be carrying things a bit too far. Maybe they should've given more opportunity to Emma Thompson who turned the novel S&S; into an amazingly good script.The scenery was very dramatic and beautiful, it could really express how the characters felt and what they were like. I liked the director's down-to-earth approach to the people, costumes and surroundings - ok, maybe the pig wandering through the house was not an indispensable accessory - versus the bit sterile and almost-too-groomed average appearance in the '95 series. Although I must say that the dark brown (YUK!) dress they made Keira wear while visiting Pemberley made me cringe in my seat.Concerning the ""most important"" character ... Mr Darcy, nobody can beat Colin Firth, that's for sure. However, I found Mathew MacFadyen's awkward and shy Darcy-figure humane and endearing. And I was positively surprised by Keira Knightley's performance as Elizabeth. She was convincingly lively, vivid and fresh. The chemistry between them was obvious (one of the most mouth-wateringly delicious scenes was the first proposal in the rain!) which is a welcome difference compared to BBC's P&P; where Jennifer Ehle sadly failed - not intellectually, but sensually - to respond to Firth's wonderful, sexy presence. I always felt it was a terrible waste. So a stronger attraction on both sides was a welcome change.I liked Rosamund Pike's Jane, Tom Hollander's Mr Collins (David Bamber's performance was not simply bordering grotesque, it was grotesque!) and Brenda Blethyn's Mrs Bennet. Judi Dench as Lady Catherine was too aggressive for me and the younger girls too wild.The most disturbing thing was really the lack of time. When I first saw the film - used as I was to the detailing in the series - I was disturbed by how the events seemed to race by, but on the second show it did not bother me any more.All in all, I think the latest P&P; fresh, delicious and enjoyable despite its shortcomings and worth watching twice."	3.0	without prejudice	2006-03-02	10	6	4

The clash between classes and the struggle between being full of pride and comprehending the depth of personal prejudices fill the screen. These two characters and the families they come from depict the dreams of those lacking and the arrogance of the rich and noble. Also there is a great depiction of the hunger of these two potential lovers have and how their communities lack any fulfillment for their hunger. These star crossed lovers fight through their issues and dismantle the social barriers to find each other. Great lines in this move!	5.0	Romeo and Juliet with death	2013-12-06	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3NJ6TTNOIOP5I	"Linda ""laddie327"""	"Okay, I'm a huge P&P; fan but I am not going to write a long analytical review here...there are plenty of them already.  I'm also not going to compare this movie to the 1995 version.  Comparing a two-hour movie to a six-hour mini-series is ""apples and oranges.""  Here's just a few thoughts that come to mind...*  The Bennet estate - What is with the shabby look and the  mud/farm animals everywhere?  In the book, the home is not richly decorated but it was certainly a lot more affluent than portrayed.*  The Bennet girls - Keira Knightley did a very good job portraying Lizzie...not perfect but not bad.  The actress who played Lydia was a little too over-the-top and was excessively annoying.  Rosamund Pike was very good as Jane and the other actresses playing Mary and Kitty were very good.*  Brenda Blethyn was very good as Mrs. Bennet and Donald Sutherland did okay as Mr. Bennet.  He did mumble a little too much.*  The Meryton Ball - What the heck was up with the hair...the women and the men?  Many of the extras (dancers, etc.) looked disheveled and needed a brush/comb at the very least.*  Characters missing - Where were the Hursts?*  Matthew Macfadyen was good as Darcy and the actor playing Bingley did a decent portrayal as well.*  What was the significance of the pig with the large ""assets""?*  The scene at Netherfield discussing ""accomplished women"" was dull and did not add anything to the character development or the attraction between Darcy and Elizabeth.*  Makeup - Knightley wore a lot of makeup.  Did you notice she is the only female who wears makeup?  The eye shadow is obvious as well as the blush.  The actress playing Caroline Bingley might have some makeup on but Knightley's was obvious, especially the end scene in the meadow.  Did they not have enough confidence in her ""natural"" beauty""?  Also, the gown Knightley wore at the Netherfield Ball - a wonder bra or push-up bra might have helped. Also, when the Bennet's left the ball, Lizzie was not in the carriage.  How did she get home?*  Lizzie visits Pemberly - What's with the nude statues?  A portrait of Darcy alone would have worked nicely.  Also, where did Lizzie's aunt and uncle go?  Lizzie walked back to the village.  Did they leave her behind?  They were all touring the estate together and then the aunt and uncle disappear.*  Judi Dench's (Lady Catherine) hairstyle - Way over the top!!!*  Bingley would never have used the word ""ass"", especially in the midst of proposing to Jane.*  Lady Catherine would not have visited the Bennets in the middle of the night.*  Darcy's open shirt while crossing the meadow....okay, I have to forgive that one....If Colin Firth can jump into a pond and walk around with a wet open see-through shirt...As a female, I loved both scenes.  Please forgive me Jane Austen.*  Knightley and Macfadyen worked well together and I enjoyed their scenes, especially the declaration of love/proposal scenes and the looks Darcy would throw at Lizzie.  It's the incurable romantic in me.  I also liked the scene at the Meryton Ball where Darcy asks Lizzie the ""encouraging affection"" question.  Lizzie's reply is perfect.  At Netherfield when Jane and Lizzie are leaving, Darcy's hand reaction to first touching Lizzie was also a nice touch.Overall, it was a decent version.  After 193 years, a little creative interpretation of the book is refreshing.  It is a pity that Hollywood won't spend more $ and make a longer version.  Obviously, there was a lot missing from this version due to time constraints.  In two hours, you can't develop the characters and attraction between Darcy and Elizabeth properly.  If they can make King Kong three plus hours, why can't they make a longer version of P&P...I; know...because it won't rake in as much money as the action and special effects movies do but it's a shame.Ooops...this turned out longer than I thought."	4.0	NOT A PERFECT VERSION BUT NOT TOO BAD	2006-05-16	15	10	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	This 2005 film is really great when depicting the English countryside in the early 19th century.  It's also brings to life the social realities of matchmaking.  The acting, especially by Kiera Knightly is fantastic.  By now you must be thinking that I would heap further accolades on this film based on the Jane Austin novel.  Well, that's not going to happen.  I know this is personal taste, but I just didn't like it.For the past several hundred years, Jane Austin's novels have been the basic theme of romantic novels and films.  There's a high spirited young woman who meets a very rich man.  She's always beautiful and of marriageable age, but he is of a higher class.  At first they hate each other and he seems like a cad.  The insults fly and the young woman shows she knows how to use her words in a clever way.  This impresses the gentleman.  Little by little, the audience and the heroine start to appreciate him.  There are always obstacles.  But in the end these two main characters always hook up.No matter how well this theme is carried out in movies, TV, or romantic songs, I always find it boring.  There are no surprises and there is just so much beautiful scenery and gorgeous ball gowns that I can stand.  Often, too, if it is a British film, I cannot understand much of the dialogue and I yearn for subtitles.Recommended for romance loves only who will love this film.  My mistake was that I was willing to watch the film in the first place.	4.0	For lovers of romance stories, but not for me	2006-12-17	8	1	7
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AIWIVN4UAFCA4	"Linda Lou ""Obsessive reader, 6-10 books a wee..."	"I think that I've seen just about every version made of this Jane Austen classic. This is such a great and endearing story that it is hard to mess it up (although the Bollywood bad-acid-trip ""Bride and Prejudice"" came very close!) But director, Joe Wright, showed that he was up to the task, doing a great job of retelling the foibles of the Bennet sisters. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth is strong and reminscent of a contemporary feminist while remaining true to the mores of the period. Matthew Macfadyen isn't the best Mr. Darcy, but it's hard to come behind the magnificent Colin Firth who played the role in 1995 as if he lived across the road from Jane Austin. Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Bennet) shines as a mother on a well-planned mission to marry off FIVE daughters. Rosamund Pike (Jane) is the classic English rose while Talulah Riley's portrayal of Mary is not the usual ugly wallflower. Newcomers Jena Malone and Carey Mulligan (Lydia and Kitty) make the best clueless Victorian ""hoochies"" ever! But the real treat here is Donald Sutherland as the estrogen drowned Mr. Bennet. He has masterfully executed an unexpected role for him, exhibiting a refreshing tongue-in-cheek patience. Dame Judi Dench, always in top form, makes the best Lady Catherine De Bourgh to date. Unlike the previous adaptations, here the viewer is not bounced back and forth between London and the countryside locations and the costumes aren't overly fussy, giving the overall production an understated lushness. I would love to see what Joe Wright could do with ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Emma""."	5.0	A GREAT REMAKE	2008-08-03	9	3	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A38RO46GVRD56P	"Linda ""Mom of 5"""	"This was a good film but not great.  The best adaptation of Jane Austen's classic book is the 5-hour miniseries created for A&E.;  In my opinion it sets the gold standard and is the version to which I compare every other version.However Keira Knightly makes a very good Elizabeth Bennett and McFadyen's Darcy is definitely worth looking at (I may be a ""mom of 5"" but my mom taught me that you're never to old to appreciate a fine looking man).  Oh and he has a great voice.This film takes liberties with the story, such as changing event settings.  For instance, in the book, Darcy did not propose to Lizzie in the pouring rain on a picturesque stone gazebo or mausoleum or whatever with a great view in the background.  However, I did enjoy the scene they added of Mr. Bingley and Darcy practicing how Bingley would propose to Jane.Overall I found the story a bit confusing and hard to follow - and I have read the book at least a dozen times.  I can't imagine how someone who never read the book would be able to follow the storyline in this movie.Donald Sutherland seems somewhat miscast as Mr. Bennett.  I guess I'm a purist - they should have cast a Brit.  And every time he laughed he had to put his hand over his mouth - I assume to hold his dentures in.  It was very distracting for me.Overall, this was an enjoyable movie and I recommend it.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3S1UO40PPZLCX	Lindsay	This movie was not absolutely horrible, it was alright to watch-if one does not consider it true to the novel Pride and Prejudice.While the cinematography was beautiful and more artistic than the BBC version (they obviously had a higher budget), the storyline was cut - to below the bare minimum. To some who don't know Pride and Prejudice, it can even be slightly confusing, because nothing is elaborated on. (The music was also too loud on the DVD, and often one would miss what they are saying and must read the captions) Pivotal moments like when Darcy comments on not wanting to dance with Elizabeth seem almost trivial in the presentation of the movie. Sometimes things seem to come out of nowhere- especially when Elizabeth finds out about Lydia, one scene she's happy, the next she walks in and sobs (it was rather funny, though it's not supposed to be).The storyline between Jane and Bingly was nowhere near as detailed as it should have been, I didn't feel it's importance. It was like the directors considered any storyline not related to Darcy and Elizabeth to be extraneous.Kiera Knightly does not play a terrible Elizabeth Bennett, though sometimes I found her to say things in a very similar manner to Jennifer Ehle, and other times she would act completely out of character for Elizabeth (though this is probably the screenplay's fault). After Lady Catherine comes near the end, Elizabeth seems completely unreasonable and immature, crying out that she wants to be left alone - this was not how Jane Austen wrote Elizabeth to be.Mr. Darcy is barely shown, and I didn't really feel like he was as important a character as he was supposed to be. Moments where he's spilling out his heart, the camera is instead focused more often on Elizabeth. Macfadyen didn't really play Darcy to what I imagined him in the book, Firth in the BBC version did a much better job.There wasn't the best chemistry between Knightly and Macfadyenand I found myself not really caring that they would end up together in the end.There are numerous other comments that could be made, but the biggest problem with the adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, was that they over dramatized it. Lady Catherine coming at night, Charlotte Lucas running away saying Elizabeth better not judge her, the proposal in the rain. It all turns Pride and Prejudice into a story that doesn't seem unique- it becomes so cliche. Jane Austen was subtle, and the movie didn't capture that at all.For those who have not read Jane Austen or seen the BBC version, the movie is not horrible, but to be honest it isn't a classic either.	2.0	2 stars as pride and prejudice, 3 stars as any old movie	2006-05-04	28	11	17
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3QJ1A1W9YDYH0	Lingering Librarian	Such a treat, to see Pride and Prejudice again! For anyone who knows and loves the book -- and knows and loves the BBC miniseries from 1995 -- this new version is worth seeing. Yes, it is not as genteel as the BBC version. There is a rough quality to the characters' lives that is perhaps more authentic. Here, we see Bennets living in a low-ceilinged house with narrow doorways, candlelight, plank floors and simple furniture. They use more pewter than silver, and their clothing is closer to homespun 18th-century, than 19th-century finery. The language is simpler, less flowery and less faithful to Jane Austen's dialog. So what? I sat in a theatre crowded with women and men who laughed out loud and even applauded when they felt moved to do so. The ending was too sugary-sweet, I will give you that. But this version is not without merit! Austen lovers, don't hesitate to see this version.	5.0	Good-hearted adaptation!	2006-03-04	16	12	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2RHV42BTJSVON	"Liolania ""In2Jesus"""	"If one were to watch a condensed version of P&P;, this is the one to watch. If one is a newcomer to P&P; this is the one to watch. If one has watched the A&E; version nine million times, and may want something fresh(despite eight other adaptations out there), this is the one to watch!Granted, I myself, am not an austere follower of Austin, but I have read enough of the novel, and seen the A&E; version enough times, to know what it is supposed to be. Call me romantic(I am), call me an idealist(I am), but no matter what way you look at it, this is the probably the best theatrical (non-television) version we will ever get.It holds true to the spirit of the book, and although there are a number of storyline omissions, and some missing characters, it keeps all the key scenes, and stays true to the characters.  Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet is spunky and refhesing and Matthew McFayden's portrayal of Mr. Darcy holds his own when compared to what is the considered the definitive portrayal of Mr. Darcy; Colin Firth. This coming from an avid Colin Firth fan as well. I love Colin Firth, and he will always be dear to my heart, but Matthew McFayden has earned a place next to him as well thanks to this movie. His Darcy is restrained, yet sexy, prideful and haughty, yet tender and kind of sensitive. He walks a very fine line, as only Firth has been able to walk before, and it is a delight to watch.The other characters, such as Lydia(Played by the always marvelous Jena Malone) and Mrs. Bennet, were not quite as over-the-top annoying as some of the portrayals of them in past versions. The relationship between Mr. Bennet and Lizzie seemed much more clearly defined as well (though the scene where Mr. Bennet apologizes was out of character for him...). Although I did enjoy the A&E;'s Mr. Collins, this one seems more appropriate to the period, and much more believable. Judi Dench is simply wonderful, and is the definitive Lady Catherine (even though they changed some of the scenes from the book, her portrayal of the character itself was fantastic!).The characters in this version seemed much more suited to the era then in the A&E; versions, the contrast between the Bennet's finfancial state and the Upper Class(Darcy & Bingley), was much more obvious, which was nice. The characters know their places, and they act like it. The dances also come off as more real and natural, not so staged as in the A&E; version.If all else fails to entice you, the Scenery is to die for! The English Moors are so beautiful their worth seeing the film for that alone! The scene were Mr. Darcy comes out of the mist to meet Elizabeth has to be one of ""The most geourgeous"" in cinema history.So my hope for you is this: That no matter how many times you've read the book, no matter how many film(Tv or movie) versions you've seen, you can appreciate this one as well and be able to drink in the scenery, the marvelous music, and the wonderful acting.God Bless ~Amy"	5.0	Pride and Prejudice condenced....	2006-01-24	59	49	10

While the Colin Firth version is beautiful and very true to the book, Matthew Macfadyen is MY Mr. Darcey! Colin Firth NEVER smiles or shows any emotion throughout the film. His character is cold, even when he's trying to woe Elizabeth. He doesn't even smile when she admits her love!!!  Macfadyen's Darcy shows vulnerability and almost desperation as his love for her grows. Also, the Firth version isn't visually as stimulating. There are scenes that are simply breathtaking with the MacFadyen version -- the sun rising when the admit their love for one another could give anyone goosebumps!My suggestion: Read the book and then you will love this beauty of this movie and its passion.	5.0	BUY THIS!!!	2010-10-05	2	1	1

I fell in love with the books first, and then dove into the world of the movie adaptations.I must admit, I was a fan of the BBC version, going into this one. I was of course skeptical due to the compressed time and even having Keira Knightley in it.I was quite pleased with this film. I went in understanding that it would only be two hours so of course things would be cut out, issues that could take up a significant amount of time were over in two minutes, and that no movie could ever live up to the book that proceeded it. The actors were the thing that made this movie work, they turned their short-lived characters into people we could grow to love and care about, or mistrust and dislike in a matter of minutes. In fact, I enjoyed a select few of them more than those in the BBC's version.If you're a Jane Austen fan, or just a fan of the movies, this is a great movie if you want to get your Austen-fix as I call it, but don't have the time to watch the other versions that can stretch out for quite a few hours.	5.0	A Movie Worthy of Being Watched	2012-07-17	2	1	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	"Let's say up front that the 2005 Pride and Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley as Lizzie and Matthew Macfadyen as Darcy, is not meant to be a 100% accurate adaptation of the book. Trimmed down to a mere 2 hours, the story had to be cut up a great deal. It's also set in the late 1700s - when a 21 year old Jane Austen first thought up the story, instead of the early 1800s, when 38 year old Jane finally finished and published the work.That all being said, this movie is amazingly well done. In some ways, it's much more realistic than other depictions of the story. Many movie versions of P&P; have the characters set up almost like cartoon characters. They are squeaky clean, their world is pristine, and they float through it. While many in the early 1800s had nice manners, their life was certainly not Lysol-clean!It was really nice, then, to see the quiet English town actually appear like a live, working English town. The story clearly has Lizzie show up with a ton of mud on her skirts after hiking across miles of marshy English countryside. In most movie versions, that means there's a hint of brown on her trimly pressed outfit. In this version, it's much more realistic. I've hiked around England - you get muddy!In some ways, the movie is like ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" - where you hear snippets of dialogue and if you know the story, you realize what is going on in the background. It really does cater strongly to people who know the full story well and don't need all the details filled in. Again, this is to be expected given there are only 2 hours of story here. Many of the backgrounds and details are shaved or missing. The characters, however, are still quite solid and fully done.Lizzie and Darcy of course are the main characters here, and they shine with a freshness that is really great. These aren't ""story members"" just walking through and trading barbs. You really get a sense that Lizzie is a flesh and blood woman who is feeling the powerful loves, hates, and other emotions. Darcy feels the same passions, reigning them in under his family training. Many of the scenes with the two characters are just amazing - when they are dancing, when they are in the gazebo in the rain.In some ways, I even feel the movie adds to the story, helping to elucidate scenes that might otherwise go over viewers' heads. Often, Charlotte's choosing to marry Collins is seen as a quiet, calm decision made without any emotion at all. I always found this depiction to be unrealistic. In this version, Charlotte makes it clear that this wouldn't be her ideal choice - but what else can she do? Does she really want to be a spinster and burden on her family? She's full of angst, but she's done the best she could with a bad situation.Also, it's always bugged me that in some movie versions, they made a big deal about Lizzie's ""revelation"" in Darcy's home that she really would have been happy as his wife. She feels this way because his servants love him so much, a sign of a truly ""gentle man"". However, some movies turn it into a gold-digging Lizzie looking around saying ""Wow, I could have lived HERE"". I was very happy that in this movie, Lizzie is touched by the gorgeous sculpture and the way Darcy's sister loves him.Even some of the minor characters are done amazingly well. I love Sutherland and Dench, they are simply wonderful. Others are less stellar - Wickham springs to mind as being an ""elf lookalike"" - but it's hard to expect every single cast member to be stunning.Highly recommended as a must-see for anyone who loves a romantic story full of incredibly fun dialogue."	5.0	Amazing Job in only 2 Hours	2005-12-18	9	8	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AUV73CPD9YBJ2	LitGirl	"As a purist of book-to-movie adaptations, I had a hard time enjoying the good points of this movie because I got too caught up in the period discrepancies and creative liberties taken with the original story.  First, they made the Bennetts look only a notch above white trash.  Second, Bingley came across as clueless, gullible, and kind of pathetic instead of naive and hopelessly optimistic.  Third (and most annoying in my opinion) they took away much of the formality that existed during that time in society, and between men and women specifically.  That formality is the main source of the humor and irony that makes Jane Austen's stories so entertaining- since people can't say what they mean, or run up to the person of their dreams and plant a kiss, they have to do everything in a more cloak and dagger way.  The dialog has to be much sharper than today's lazy screenplays to convey the same feelings and emothions.  After I stopped fuming over these issues, I decided to see the movie again to see if I would enjoy it more without such specific expectations.  The second time around, I was able to appreciate the acting much more, especially Keira Knightley.  I also found that I actually liked the portrayel of Jane- in the BBC miniseries, she seems a bit blind in her desire to believe the best in people; in this version, she comes across as a bit more aware.  Despite some of the effects of ""creative liberty"", I did enjoy this movie- not the best adaptation, but very respectable."	4.0	Not as good as the BBC miniseries, but still well worth it	2006-02-15	13	8	5

The same people playing Nancy Drew regarding historical inaccuracies(and half of their criticisms are uninformed or misinformed by other period pieces) don't seem to be using the same critical eye to the BBC adaption, which is incredible but has it's inaccuracies as well.If you go into this movie with an open and flexible mind,keeping in mind how the medium of cinema and the medium of television will make COMPLETELY different products(and thank goodness-I didn't want a carbon copy of the BBC version), you'll enjoy it. It does take some artistic liberties, it does condense alot of the story, and it's take is less pretti-fied than most people are use to(compare this version to the more realistic and I think best Austen adaption to date-""PErsuasion""), but what I loved most about it is that it ""got"" the spirit of the novel, and from that spirit, made new moments to enjoy(the first proposal? great!).And just a side note---if you don't think Colin Firth isn't happy as can be to have someone else tagged as ""Mr. DarcY' after 10 years, you are delusional!He's probably thanking his lucky stars...."	5.0	Colin Firth's feelings won't be hurt if you like this one, people!	2006-03-12	18	11	7

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2X0CHS8E37LAS	Liz Ellerbe	I was thrilled with the opening of this movie and have replayed it and all the Darcy scenes many times so far.  The dance scene, while seemingly more Shakespearean and mid-1600s, was enchanting and the Darcy entrance extremely intriguing.  Where this stunning actor has been all these years, I have no idea.  He could do period literature, I'm sure, but has not, to my knowledge.  And to my mind, he's a comparable talent to Daniel Day-Lewis.  His great good looks, terrific baritone, gait and superb acting are a real treat.The direction is obviously brilliant, the proposal scene awesome (except for Keira's jaws-like mouth renouncing poor Darcy.)  With MacFadyen being more Regency England and less Hollywood, credence is added to this entrancing movie.  I fear that this dashing actor is not ambitious or we certainly would have seen more of him in American movies.	5.0	Surprised at my reaction...	2008-07-28	6	3	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1R3AU8YO2CN9B	LizzieB	This is my favorite adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, and I have had the standard DVD version for several years. However, now that I have a blu-ray player I thought I would upgrade to the blu-ray format, but was concerned that it wouldn't be worth the extra money. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. The blu-ray edition is vastly superior both visually and musically. I've found that quite often there's really no significant difference between the standard and blu-ray versions. But with a film this aethetically dynamic, I was stunned by the improvement in quality.Overall, whether you're a Jane Austen devotee or you simply enjoy this film, go with the blu-ray version.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AEELKH7K21S1G	Lizzy	"This movie could have been wonderful but was quite horrid.  Jane Austen created some of the best characters in literature and this movie changes just about everybody of importance, removing the wit and turning it into soppy porridge.  Mr. Bennet is one of my favorite characters of all time  and his character was unrecognizable.  Jane was supposed to be sweet and kind and yet she came across as hard and cold in the movie.  Lizzie is intelligent and perhaps a tiny pit pert but not silly and ridiculous as she is portrayed here.  Mr. Darcy was also a sad failure.  He was dour rather than proud and seemed about to cry throughout the movie.  Ish.Plus, I had serious issues with the behavior portrayed in the movie.  Regency women DID NOT run around with their hair down!  Every time I saw that, it infuriated me and pulled me out of the movie.  Darcy and Elizabeth would have never met up in the morning in their night clothes.  This is the equivalent of wandering down the street naked.  To top it off, the director then had Darcy go to ask for Lizzie's hand in the same night clothes, with his collar open and no cravat!  Are you kidding me?!!The manners of everyone in the movie were awful.  Lydia was silly and heedless in the book but Jane and Lizzie were not!  The costuming was also sub-par.  Lizzie's dresses were all wrong.  First, she looked like a servant in dowdy colors and fabrics.  Why dress the lead in such an awful fashion?  Her clothes shouldn't have been as fine as the Bingley sisters but Lizzie was not a poor farm girl.  Second, the waist was much too low for the time period.I was left with the very strong impression that the director felt that he had to distinguish himself by ""improving"" on the original.  Sad, bad, pompous mistake.  The BBC version was so fabulous that I think he tried much too hard to make this one stand apart from it.  Well, he achieved his goal.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1GQAKL9CGQLP1	L. M. Keefer	If you are a PRIDE AND PREJUDICE fan, think you will enjoy this enactment of it.  Although we all love Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, Matthew Macfadyen plays a delicious Darcy as well.  Keira Knightley is a lovely Elizabeth Bennett.  The scenery and sets seem very realistic and this movie is a visual delight.Other actors who illumined scenes for me are Rosamund Pike as Jane, Elizabeth's old sister and Donald Sutherland as the father.  Of course, Judi Dench as a noblewoman was a welcome addition as well.  I hadn't realized that Carey Mulligan played the youngest Bennett sister.It seemed the movie clung pretty closely to the plot.  To use Chatsworth as Mr. Darcy's home was an inspired choice.The movie is worth watching just for the visual charm.  It seemed realistic, like it was really happening in the 1800's.  That's probably one of the highest compliments one can pay a movie - you don't feel like you are watching a movie.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AAV7HHAHNJRHF	"LMZ ""LMZ"""	"I wasn't crazy about this version the first time I saw it, but I have grown to love it. I was accustomed to a certain stiffness in other film versions and a (rightful) fixation on the period's rigid social mores. So, the ambiance of pigs and mud and barking dogs threw me at first. When a co-worker asked me how I liked it after my first viewing, I complained, ""Too rustic,"" but had to admit that the lushness and the cinematography are gorgeous. That's what made me watch it again. And again.Some of the narrative choices are a little strange (why does Darcy make his first proclamation of love in a gazebo during a downpour??) and some of the casting doesn't work (Donald Sutherland is so wrong as Mr. Bennet). The actors who play Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins in the A&E; version are impossible to outdo. And while a Colin Firth or a Laurence Olivier is probably more physically appropriate as Darcy, Matthew Macfadyen conveys a disarming vulnerability in the character.I'm not usually very moved by romance, but the scene in which Darcy crosses the meadow at dawn to find Elizabeth (yeah, well, it works here) is the singularly most romantic sequence I have ever seen in a film. It's lovely.So I think of this as the ""outdoorsy"" version of the story.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2UUBPM4ZRSEQ0	"Looking out and looking in ""None"""	The strongest parts of this film is the real-life adaptation of the Bennet family.  We see Mrs. Bennet not as the dim-witted mother who is eager to marry her daughter's off but as a real mother concerned over real-life situations in those days.  Yes, back then a woman's ticket to a good life was to marry well but it was even harder to marry for both money and love.But that's not where the movie ends.  We are exposed to breathtaking cinematorgraphy, (Some parts of Britain I never knew exist!) and actors who are molded so well for their parts.  Kiera Knightly shines as Elizabeth Bennet in this adaptation and Jenna Malone and Carey Mulligan are not as annoying as Lydia and Kitty in the 1995 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.One set back to this movie would be its adaptation.  For those who are exposed to the Pride and Prejudice for the first time may be left confused.  The story moves forward in some parts through narration or dialogue rather than seeing actual scenes , such as Wickham's dealings and his connection to Mr. Dary's sister.  Also, the audience has to pay attention to the background and foreground parts of the film as the story moves forward through background interactions.  This movie is so much more 'open' then previous films that (blending background with foreground)the viewer will need to pay more attention to the dialogue and try and understand the feelings of the characters (ex: Eliza's alienation during the Netherfield ball).BOTTOM LINE:This is a great film with real-life in 19th century appeal.  Mr. Darcy is more of a character to understand in this film and Ms. Bennet shines true.  I think we get more of a sense of Ms. Austen's (author) feminist views (abliet they aren't harsh ones).  Bits of the movie may need more concentration as there is blending of background/foreground.  Also, Austen truists may feel a bit cheated with only an adaptation version of the film.  For those who want a more 'true' and stretched out version of Pride and Prejudice, I recommend the 1995 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.	5.0	Real-life adaptation	2006-03-04	8	5	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2QB6NHSTQUCZI	Loraine Marie Dever	At different times in my life I have read this classic over and over and enjoyed it increasingly. I have seen many of the adaptations and always thought it a bit stogy and rigid. This version has been criticized by some as being a little bit &#34;too down and dirty&#34;. I feel the tone was just right in depicting a class who lost their money and are struggling despite all odds to keep their old life together. The mud outside (it is a farm), walls in need of paint and hanging tapestries sets the tone correctly. Just compare it with Mr. Darcy's estate.Keira Knightley is a delight, but I have seen and become inured to most of her coy mannerisms. I think the interest and a bit of rogueness lies with Matthew Macfadyen. Time shows he literally saves the day and the movie with his passion and loving manner. He is a vital part and is the epitome of the selflessness of a gentleman. I would not change any of the cast.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1I9B4PSCDDWOO	"lordhoot ""lordhoot"""	I found Pride and Prejudice to be a superbly well adapted film. While the Jane Austen purists may not approved of all the changes in this movie, I thought the script was superbly well thought out and its adopted the book into a well made two hour movie. This movie is basically the director Joe Wright's vision of the book. There is nothing wrong with it. After all, the three Lord of the Rings movies were Peter Jackson's vision of the book, not the book itself.The movie proves to be well directed and well acted. The two key characters, Lizzie and Darcy were well represented by Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadyn. Knightley proves to be the right age and she managed to captured the character of Lizzie superbly well. I thought McFadyn did well but from all I read, Colin Firth from that mini-series hold the gold standard for playing Darcy. Firth must be very good indeed. The movie choose to centered around those two characters and goes from the initial false impression of each other to realization of truth about each other. The supporting cast proves to be quite excellent, both Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench steal scenes during their limited time on the screen. I thought Brenda Blethyn who played the super annoying mother probably did the best job of all. Tom Hollander who played Cousin William Collins also proves to be excellent. Thanks to him, Lizzie's horror of the thought of marrying his character can be made clear for all to see. The production values proves to be very high, costumes fitted the time period of the book very nicely.This movie probably will not satisfied the pure-hearted Jane Austen fans. But for all others, this two hour movie will do quite nicely as it captured the spirit of the book and its two lead characters.	4.0	Well adapted movie	2005-11-30	8	6	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2COA6ZFGAK3UR	lore	The title of my review says it all. After watching the comments of those involved in writing, directing, and acting in the film it's obvious they didn't understand Austin's plot. They don't understand the customs of the time period. They didn't get the fact that Austin's book is humorous. At one point in an interview the screenwriter says the story revolves around Lizzie's pride and Darcy's prejudice. When in fact in Austin's novel it was Miss. Bennett's prejudice and Darcy's pride that caused their conflict. The screenwriter also didn't get the fact that Mr. Bennett held his wife in total contempt in Austin's story. He made fun of her in front of their children. And it was this element in the Bennett's relationship that drove the two older sisters to insist on marrying for love. They didn't want to be in marriages where they couldn't love and respect their spouses. The scenery in the movie is lovely--but too rustic. I doubt the Bennett's in Austin's novel had a large boar running through their house. And Mr. Bingley was a complete fop in this movie version. Donald Southerland reminds me of Lee Marvin in Cat Baloo. Mrs. Bennett looks and sounds like a fishwife. All in all--I cannot give it a high rating. If you want to see Pride & Prejudice--watch the Colin Firth version. It's a whole lot closer to Jane Austin's original story.	3.0	the screenwriter doesn't understand Austin's plot	2006-06-01	48	40	8

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3D0GDUBKQGJ81	Lori Woody	"Why the newest adaptation of 'Pride and Prejudice' fails in its attempt to accurately portray Jane Austen's beloved novel.The most famous of Jane Austen's works, 'Pride and Prejudice,' was first published in 1813 and still remains a favorite among many with a love for good literature and well written romance. Ever since movies become popular, companies have tried to produce films that bring Austen's, (and other famous authors') books to life. We enjoy seeing character burst forth from black and white pages into vivid, realistic people thanks to actors and actresses that portray them. Yet, while viewing Focus Feature's 2005 adaptation of 'Pride and Prejudice,"" I have come to the conclusion that were Jane Austen alive today, she -and other respectable women of the 19th century- would be horrified at the atrocious misrepresentation of Austen's characters.The most obvious change is that of the book's heroine, Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Bennet. The first difference that I noticed was her lack of respect for authority. This is first apparent after her refusal of Mr. Collins, when she angrily tells her parents, ""I won't marry him, you cannot make me!"" and runs out of the house. Also, in the conversation that takes place between Elizabeth and Colonel Fitzwilliam during a Sunday morning sermon, and afterwards, when her mother asks about Lady Catherine de Bourge, Elizabeth screams, ""For once in you're life, leave me alone!"" Jane Austen never allows Elizabeth to display such a lack of respect and self-control in the novel. The movie also fails to represent Lizzie's complete trust and affection for her sister, Jane. She denies even hearing of Mr. Bingley during her stay with the newlywed Collins, and does not tell Jane of Darcy's proposal. In Austen's book, the two sisters always confided in each other.The changes made in Mr. Darcy's character are equally disturbing. He appears so emotionless and shows almost no change in expression when he speaks that one wonders if he feels anything at all. Jane Austen's Darcy was undoubtedly stern and proud, but the dull manner in which Matthew McFayden expresses -or fails to express- himself is very tiresome, indeed.Furthermore, in Austen's novel Mrs. Bennet is presented as motherly, and often loud and embarrassing; making inappropriate remarks at all the wrong times. In the movie, she goes beyond humiliating and well into vulgar as she dangles her legs off a table she's sitting on during the ball, and sloshes her dessert on an unsuspecting young man.The whole film is filled with frustrating errors. You're extremely fortunate if you can determine which girl is Lydia and which is Kitty before the dreadful elopement with Mr. Wickham. Everyone listens to conversations behind doors and constantly talk over one another. Mr. Bennet always appears to be half drunk, Lizzie giggles after almost every sentence no matter the gravity of the situation which greatly downplays the drama, Lady Catherine arrives at the Bennet's to admonish Elizabeth in the middle of the night when all civil folk are asleep, and Kitty and Lydia wear pig-tails to a ball. The dialogue is so rushed that it leaves you with a feeling of something missing. If you can even catch what the characters said in the first place. If the movie makers were so short on time, they should have foregone the nauseating scene with Mr. Darcy's collection of naked statues which was a completely unnecessary addition.Even in the wardrobe department, the movie went wrong. Mr. Darcy proposes for the second and last time to Elizabeth while they are both in their bed clothes. An idea which would have been scandalous to anyone living in Jane Austen's time period. Caroline Bingley is not even properly dressed at the Netherfield ball. She is shown in a plain, sleeveless gown with very thin straps in a time when lace was all the rage and long sleeves the newest fashion in London. Miss Bingley with her love of pomp and display of social status would never have worm a gown such as the one she wears in the movie. In the film, Caroline Bingley was about 200 years ahead of herself in fashion.I could continue to describe the atrocities of the movie until there was enough to fill a book, but I will end my comparison by saying, that Focus Features does no credit to Jane Austen's wonderful romance in their ridiculous movie. If you want to watch a film that historically and book-wise does justice to Jane Austen, stick to the A&E; version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle who do a marvelous job!"	1.0	Pride and Prejudice, or Pomp and Partiality?	2007-01-12	116	87	29

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1DMSKBLQTIFH6	Lorraine M. Smith	I was determined to see it at the movies ever since it came out because I liked the book and saw it. Jane Austen is a funny author and this movie has definitely captured her wit. I liked it better than the BBC version by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and I think every version ever made although I've never seen them all.First of all, the circumstances of the Bennett family is very realistic and the characters were very well-chosen, especially Mrs. Bennett and Keira Knightly who judging by her earlier works that she would make a good Elizabeth. (The only character that I wasn't satisfied with was Mr. Bingley.) Then there was Mr. Collins, his worship of Catherine de Bourgh and the ridiculous proposal to Elizabeth was done just right. Charlotte Lucas and Caroline Bingley were just exactly how I pictured they would be and Fitzgerald Darcy looks very arrogant indeed and shows interest in Lizzie in the right places. I must say that I like the rearrangements of places important things happen at, such as the first time Darcy proposes to Elizabeth.The only part that depressed me was the rush of Darcy's letter to Elizabeth, which explained his nervous relationship with Wickham and reveals Wickham's true light. I feel that the elopement of Wickham and Darcy's sister wasn't explained very well and the elopement of Wickham and Lydia did not excite the nerves of the audiences for long. But the ending was a satisfying version of the modern movie required kiss of romance classics and isn't overdone. Overall I recommend this movie for everyone of all age any place in the world no matter you've read the novel or not--I'm sure you'll all like it.	5.0	Wonderful!!!!	2006-02-18	10	5	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A8SGLDOPCFPM3	LostBoy76	"I must admit that it boggles my mind to see so many unfavourable reviews of this wonderful, endearing adaptation of Jane Austen's classic. Cinematic gems are a rare thing these days. We seem to be surrounded by crass, unmitigated tripe (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, G.I. Joe, Old Dogs, the Saw series, etc.) that insult the intelligence of the viewer and seek to beat us over the head with special effects and casual violence. These films and many more are worthy of disdain, and yet what do we have here but a legion of people with the myopic effrontery to slam ""Pride and Prejudice"" with a one-star review!! You people make a mockery of the rating system with your hyperbole. Many (especially old people) seem absolutely obsessed with the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version, which I liked very much as well, but thought was a bit stiff. I agree that the story moves a little too briskly in the newer version (I wish it were five hours long, too), but in all other respects I adore this movie.Keira Knightley is simply beautiful and luminous as Elizabeth Bennett, and Matthew MacFadyen brings real emotion and warmth to the proud character of Mr. Darcy. The chemistry between these two is exquisite. All of the other actors and actresses are excellent, as well, as is the cinematography. The scene in which Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, with the rain-swept countryside in the background, is handled beautifully; the emotions expressed in the faces of the two leads are spot-on and make the scene more heartfelt and engaging than anything in the 1995 version. There is simply more feeling in this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" than in any other Jane Austen adaptation that I've seen, which is exactly want I want to go with the wonderful dialogue and piercing social commentary."	5.0	My Favourite Adaptation of Jane Austen	2010-02-06	8	5	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AN94YI3URSAII	Lostgirl	"I really tried to come to this movie with and open mind. I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen and I thought the 1995 BBC miniseries actually came close to doing justice to her novel. Still, I was looking foreward to seeing a new interpretation. Unfortunately this one seemed to miss the point of the story.Jane Austen had a hilarious way of satarizing the social conventions and mores while being in their midst. This film ignores the social conventions altogether and therefore misses a great deal of Austen's humor. For example an unmarried man and woman would NEVER greet each other in their pajamas. A man would never visit his fiancee while she was lying sick in bed in her nightgown. When these rules of propriety are ignored by the film, how are we supposed to understand or believe that it's a big deal when Lydia runs away with Wickham!? Another example is Lady Catherine. This is a woman who lives and dies by her snobbery and rigorous adherance to social conventions. Yet in this film we see her barge into the Bennet household in the middle of the night and wake Lizzie up to ask a question that could easily waited until morning (when Lady Catherine wouldn't have had to get her carriage driver out of bed to drive several miles in the dark- no streetlights remember- to the Bennet household) Because no one adhere's to societies rigorous, and for the most part arbitrary, rules, the movie misses the opportunies to subtly wink at the audience as it laughs at such things.Another weakness lies in the casting. Granted these actors had big shoes to fill. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle seemed to embody their characters in the 1995 miniseries, but as I said, there are other ways to interpret and play the characters. Unforunately here everyone seems as if they're reading lines with dramatic inflection- not acting. You can almost imagine Keira Knightly's script having notes saying ""insert spunkiness here"".While the scenery is lovely, the windswept cliff and farm images seem to recollect the tortured landscape of a Bronte adaptation more than a manacured Austen setting.Overall this film comes off as one big missed opportunity."	1.0	Not even an attempt at historical accuracy?	2006-11-22	55	34	21

I went back and saw the 10PM show the same day.  Ultimately I saw it four times in the theater.Either you like this genre, or you don't; you love Jane Austen, or you don't.  I do.  And I don't hold the good people who put her stories up on the big screen to any particular standard.  I really like the Greer Garson version, I like the BBC series.  This movie is something else.  It's not quite a reinterpretation, but it does add another dimension to the story.  That isn't a problem for me -- it's a different medium; I didn't go to the movie to have someone read the book for me.  The characters in this movie do not all have perfect hair, are not perfectly beautiful, look like they occasionally get B.O.  But you like them.  Alot.The film resonated with me for days and days; I bought the soundtrack, I re-read the book again (not for the first time).Don't be put off by Matthew McFaydden's sterness in the beginning; it's deliberate and by the end of the film I believe that you will agree he was absolutely perfect in the role.  It must be hard play that character for people who in large part already know how the story turns out.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ	"L. Power ""nlp trainer"""	Certainly this is one of the two most intriguing versions of this movie I have seen.If Jane Austen herself were alive today, I suspect whe would love this version.In the Laurence Olivier version, I thought his Darcy came across as somewhat affected and foppish.  I have not seen the Colin Firth version yet, however I did see his depiction of Darcy in the modern Bridget Jones Diary movies, and he did seem off in his attitude towards Renee Zelwegger's character.  He seemed too snooty, and as if he genuinely disliked her at times for no reason.My other favorite version is the Bollywood version, Bride and Prejudice, a must see totally enjoyable version with the beautiful Aishwarya Rai, and replete with Bollywood conventions including musical numbers.The Keira Knightley version I have seen several times, and even made copious notes about it, because whether you know it or not, many love stories follow the template of this story, and it has become an enduring classic for good reason.The dialogue is simply beautiful, the scenes excellently executed, the lead actor Matthew MacFadyen interplays brilliantly with Keira, offering excellently nuanced scenes.  Finally, a lead actor who truly does justice to the role.Like many love stories it starts out on the wrong foot, when Darcy disses her to a friend.  He does not know she has overheard.  She responds with some later banter putting him in his place, and like the flick of a switch he becomes intrigued with her. Yet as you get deeper into the story, misunderstandings arise, new perceptions, a whole welter of emotions.I especially loved the scene where he proposes the first time and totally screws it up. She is hurt and angry, and turns on him, and yet beneath that anger stirs a passion.  Beautifully done.Mr. Darcy: ...Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances?Elizabeth Bennet: And those are the words of a gentleman. From the first moment I met you, your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain for the feelings of others made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon to marry. [they look at each other for a long time as though about to kiss]I also enjoyed the performance of Collins played by Tom Hollander, the repressed smutty preacher whose small estate adjoins her ladyship's rather large abutment.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1TWTULVD6F22O	"L. Quido ""quidrock"""	"Joe Wright was cast to direct the latest version of ""Pride and Prejudice"". Hmmmm. Joe Wright, directed a couple of forgettable movies, followed by 3 mini-series (the little knowns ""Nature Boy"" from 2000, ""Bodily Harm"" from 2002 and a lavish, and well-made version of the life of Charles 2,""Charles II: The Power and the Passion, 2003) for A&E;/BBC. What made the powers behind the newest attempt to film Austen for the big screen choose Joe Wright?Well, Joe got it, right, that is, in many ways. He's made a more contemporary telling of this, my favorite of Austen's tales, and he's done it well. In a run time of less than 2.5 hours, his version will be more easier to digest than the two mini-series of this same work (the stand alone BBC version from 1980 with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul and the 1993 A&E;/BBC version that most people know the best; with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth). But, as well done as it is, you'll find it wanting vs. either of these fine mini-series, and the film also pales in comparison to the Emma Thompson/Ang Lee run at ""Sense and Sensibility"" in 1995.If you are an Austen fan, the amount of characterization that has to be cut from the story to fit it in to a 2.5 hour run time, will simply horrify you. In particular, both Mr. Wickam and Mr. Collins, potential suitors for the Bennett bevy, are given very small amounts of screen time. Catherine de Bourg, the patroness whose money flows all over a variety of characters in the film (Darcy, for one, is her nephew) was played by Judi Dench with a particularly elegant stiff upper lip, but was given little to do.Director Wright has given us marvelous cinematography and beautiful settings (notably Darcy's estate at Pemberley). He has the same passion I do for Austen's work, and tried to keep the themes.""Pride and Prejudice"" is a love story between a young woman in a family stretched with 5 daughters and literally no dowries in 19th century England. In the book, the Bennetts are an upper middle class lot; in this film, in which Wright instilled a sense of real ""living on the farm"", they are shabby versions of Austen's intent.Mr. Bennett (Donald Sutherland) is a country gentleman beloved by his daughters and befuddled by the antics of his wife. Said wife's main passion in life is making sure the girls are all married off so that they are not penniless when the parents die. Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blethyn in a comedic performance that is perhaps a little over the top) makes no pretense of her intentions, and they are embraced with different degrees of exhuberance by her daughters. Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Jane (Rosamund Pike), the eldest, are a bit embarrassed by their mother's antics and manage to try and ignore her histrionics while building their anxieties over marriage.It is Jane, the loveliest, whose heart is broken by Mr. Bingley from London, and Elizabeth who runs afoul of his dour friend, Mr. Darcy.Before the film is finished, the viewer is as surprised as Elizabeth to learn that Mr. Darcy has fallen in love with her, and having been rejected, Darcy sets out to change Elizabeth's first impression and win her heart by helping her family and by showing how much he cares for his own young sister.Keira Knightley was a good choice for Jane, although the lesser known actresses in both the British mini-series were better in the role than she was. Knightley looks the part as Austen described it, and has a quicksilver screen persona that fits Elizabeth well. If there is not the romance, the chemistry that should have grown on screen between Elizabeth and Darcy, it is not for wont of Knightley's efforts to portray it.Instead, in portraying the difficult Darcy, who, after all, is supposed to be wooden, actor Matthew Macfayden (with an impressive list of British television credentials including the MI5 drama, Spooks) was entirely too successful. He is wooden to a painful degree, and has difficulty turning his cold arrogance into foolishness when he first becomes infatuated with Elizabeth. And he's equally not credible as a ""do gooder"". The growth of that Austen staple, the love between two people who society has not meant to be together, the growing awareness, the yearning, well, it is missing from this film. It was not missing in the mini-series. Generally speaking, it usually means the director does not know how to capture the essence of love and longing on film, does not know how to invoke it from his characters and bleed it through to the audience. Despite this, I must say, that I did not walk away wishing to see Matthew Macfayden on the big screen again.And thus, we get an interesting movie, with some fine touches, some believable characters, a solid script and beautiful filming, music and costumes. But contrary to the print ads and the trailers, this is not the film of the year, just a pleasing version of an Austen tale that has been done better in the past.Definitely worth a trip to the theater!"	4.0	Not the movie of the year....	2005-11-23	13	7	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3DB4HIFMK68AU	L. Smith	I found this version of my favorite novel to be very touching and romantic, though lacking much of the gently ironic tone that makes Jane Austen unique.  Mrs. Bennet, for example, was beautifully played by Brenda Blethyn, but she was rather more sweetly dithering than the constantly plotting, embarassingly outspoken character in the book. I did like the Bennet sisters' portrayals, though, and I found Darcy quite believable in his reserve and his almost painful discomfort in the rambunctious social milieu of Meryton.  The cinematography is superb, however, and the sets and costumes are flawless.  All told, the film fulfills the director's vision and gives the viewer a wonderfully intimate look at life in early nineteenth-century England.	4.0	Lovely film, less Austen than Merchant/Ivory	2006-08-22	6	5	1

I thought that Matthew Macfadyen did an excellent job portraying Mr. Darcy.  I wish I could say the same for Keira Knightley but I just didn't buy it. The relationship between Rosamund Pike (Jane) and Lizzie was just not convincingly close as depicted in the book and although this has nothing to do with the movie, . .  Keira always does this weird thing with her lips (trying to make them look fuller while pouting) that really bugs me. I like the way the set design, costumes, and the lack of to much makeup made the movie a little more ""authentic"", but what I truly loved was the music.  I felt like the music really transported me into that time. I felt like this movie tried desperately to make this movie authentic (much like the 1995 production of Persuasion) but due to time restraints failed to develop the depth of the characters of the book.

However, I was so thrilled that the Bennett family are portrayed as such a vibrant and close-knit family with more ""country"" roots than we are shown in that other version. Even their house, shown as less pristine, makes sense for a middle class home in the country. The girls show more of the natural feelings that a young single woman would feel even at that time, or maybe more so since marriage was the goal of their 'occupation'. Even a sensible girl would be giddy over a handsome man. I enjoyed that Mr. Bennett was endeared to all his daughters and even to his wife more in this movie.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3UANHCY16H45E	Luv Chocolate	Even though the BBC version is probably more true to the book it definitely feels like a TV movie.  This big-screen version is  palpably richer with gorgeous cinematography and a beautiful score. Many things felt more realistic. The wonderful Bennett country home with the muddy yard, farm animals and laundry hanging. Ballroom scenes with everyone packed in together.I thought it was amazing how every actor made their character uniquely their own especially considering the hard act they had to follow. I especially enjoyed Brenda Blethlyn as Mrs. Bennett.  Matthew Macfadyen and Kiera Knightly had wonderful chemistry. Their pivotal scene together is one for the ages.  My only complaint is that the movie is so short - I would have liked to have seen as much of these actors as I did the ones in the series.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AFWNZ3NV9B8PX	lynchy	Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed, as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story.As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all.Not only that, this movie is Boring. 1/3 of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. When they finally met in the field at the end, couldn't care less if they got together or not. As I have read the book and watch the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to go, before I could finally leave the cinema. Mr Darcy whoever he is in this movie, definitely can't act. He looks also too young to play Mr Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed like he needs to get through the script or something. Where is the build up? At first, he seems confused with everything. He is just bizarre! It all looks put on.Was trying not to compare to the Colin Firth version but if you love that version, you will most likely be disappointed anyway.The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress as some sort of ladylike fashion, and hasn't been brought up in a squaller. Her dresses indicates she might be the poorest peasant in all of England walking around in nothing more than brown rags. Is that what Jane Austen had in mind?I didn't agree with a couple of scenes in the movie in the fact, that I don't think it would be considered proper in that society for men to do such things, i.e for Darcy to walk in (without knocking on the front door - I might add) - in the middle of the night to see Elizabeth and give her a letter??? If he was a gentleman, very unlikely. Secondly, Mr Bingley just walking into Jane's room while she is sick to see if she is okay? Doesn't he have any sense of propriety? Mr Bingley who has wealth and hopefully sense should know better.There is some things that are said that sound too modern for the period this movie is set in, and not at all like Jane Austen. Bingley's character is shockingly done, to me he behaves like a simpleton, not a character to like and respect. Mr Bingley to me was always suppose to be likeable. To me, he is on the same lineage that we would view Mr Collins. What about that laugh of his!!! Wickham hardly has a presence so you don't get to feel at all for the lead up to Lydia taking off with him and Mr & Mrs Hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence at all. Everything feels in sequence but not a smooth flow - feels very jumpy.Didn't see or feel the chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy.Okay I am a fan of the other but was willing to give this a go and knew there would be differences. I guess my biggest disappointment is the portrayal of Darcy and Bingley. Bingley and Jane seemed like a bizarre couple to be getting attached. I didn't think the way they portrayed Bingley would be the type of person that the Jane they portrayed would go for. Again - chemistry?? Questionable.The ending - where is it?? What a bizarre way to end it.	2.0	Sorry, it bored me	2006-02-06	35	14	21
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AX6FK3J7U6GUH	"Lynda B. Vernalia ""BBCAmerican"""	"I am an avid fan of Jane Austen, especially Pride & Prejudice.  A friend loaned me this copy to compare it to the other versions and what I found was a sorry excuse for movie making.  They should have named it, ""The Reduced Austen Company's 'Pride & Prejudice' in 20 minutes.""  I have never seen movie actors given nothing to work with and then rushing through it in such a graceless, humorless, unmoving way.  Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFayden were a nice looking pair but neither was up to the stuff of Austen.  Did the director not see the wit and wisdom of the film?  They ""Hollywoodized"" and tortured the soul of the story.  It does not follow the book, they rewrote lines from the novel, making it harsher, more vulgar.  Do we wonder that the British laugh at us when it come to film making?I feel for Dame Judi Dench who was given nothing to work with, no room to move, whose delivery was rushed for the sake of ""movie time""  Her talents were wasted in this film.I gave one star for pretty views (considering so many scenes were ridiculously out of doors.)  I'll grant that the last 2 minutes of the movie were sweet, though had almost nothing to do with novel, but it's not worth a rental or even another viewing in my opinion. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle got it right.  Matthew Macfayden will never be a ""true"" Mr. Darcy.  Please, please don't bother."	1.0	What a waste of film!	2010-02-05	16	10	6

I watched it once and was charmed despite my difficulty in understanding some of the dialogue. I watched it again and became captivated. This is a gorgeous version, and I am now a huge fan of Matthew MacFadyen's. He portrayed Mr. Darcy with subtlety and humor.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AI2G6ZZS0G00Y	Lynne P. Caldwell	Okay, I admit to being a Pride and Prejudice snob.  I've read the book 14 times in the last three and a half decades.  When I've found the right superlatives, I'll write a review!  And yes, I am probably prejudiced against anything that is not the 6 hour A&E; mini-series (with Firth--I have to say it too!).  But I tried to like this movie.  I even enjoy the books that have been similar to Austen's (like Pride, Prejudice and Jasmine Field).But there were just too many things that I didn't like.  For example, there was very little character development.  Keira Knightley does a well enough job as Elizabeth Bennet but Matthew Macfadyen (whom I loved in MI-5) did nothing but sneer in this film.  I don't know how anyone could form an attachment to someone who did not have any redeeming qualities.  I know that they cast the Americans for the American audience but I also didn't like the casting of Sutherland.  His 5-day stubble annoyed me, as did his American accent during part of the film.  The worst character portrayal though was Bingley.  He was definitely not a buffoon in the book....  In the movie, he acted like a simpleton!I do give kudos to the makers of this movie; trying to recreate the greatest novel ever written (my opinion) is certainly an ambitious undertaking.  The scenery was lovely and the people unfamiliar with the story will probably love this movie.	2.0	Because of my Pride and Prejudices!	2006-03-09	32	17	15

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A35BW804G6U5EY	Mackenzie	While I will admit that I much prefer the 1995 BBC version, this was an excellent movie and only a two hour commitment versus nearly six hours.  All of the important story elements were included and the characters were well cast.  I especially liked Rosamund Pike and Simon Woods as Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley.  And Jena Malone was very convincingly annoying as Lydia Bennett.  They did take a few creative liberties but I thought they turned out well.  For example, in this movie, Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Bennett do seem to love each other despite their banter. I was okay with that though, maybe others wouldn't be.  I would recommend at least watching it, if not buying it.	5.0	Dug it!	2011-08-11	1	1	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3MPWWR2QJOK6D	Mack	"Pride & Prejudice is a lovely book and this production does it justice.  In the book, when Mr. Darcy FINALLY takes Elizabeth's hand, our hearts rejoice.  Toward the end of this production, when Mr. Darcy FINALLY walks across a gorgeous English field at sunrise toward Elizabeth, our hearts rejoice.  It's a beautiful scene and, as it should be, all is well!  Having loved the book for so many years and having seen every other production of the book, I am a tough audience, but Knightly is pretty much perfect in the roll of Elizabeth.  After Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, Macfayden was a bit disappointing at first for me, but he grew on me.  Brenda Blethyn is appropriately irritating as Mrs. Bennett and Donald Sutherland is appropriately scruffy, distant and even somewhat icky as Mr. Bennett.  Apparently the period details are accurate, but I did not see that Mr. Bennett in the book.  The ""final"" scene was a bit too much and a bit sappy.  However, all in all, no major complaints."	5.0	Lovely Movie	2013-03-09	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A7NRL3R5C0AL4	"Maeri ""Marysz"""	"Maybe every generation needs to re-invent Jane Austen for themselves. This  film interpretation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" stresses the youthfulness of the characters. Elizabeth and Darcy look younger here than they were in the most recent dramatization that featured Colin Firth. I loved the rough and tumble look of the Bennett's home. It's a non-prissy look at life in the early 19th century. The film's expansive outdoor scenes were like a series of Bruegel paintings--the characters' romances became part of larger ongoing drama of rural life. McFayden's Darcy is refreshingly nerdy. He's a nice change from the usual drop-dead handsome Darcys (like Laurence Olivier and Firth). Knightly is equally refreshing as a tomboyish Elizabeth.This is the story of two intelligent young people cursed with embarrassing relatives. Elizabeth has an emotionally disengaged father, a vulgar mother who continuously puts her foot in her mouth and three out-of-control sisters. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine, is an ill-behaved snob whose rude behavior is worse than the whole Bennett family put together.This film really conveys the precariousness of the Bennett's financial and social situation more than other dramatizations. We can see why Mrs. Bennett's desperation to get her daughters married off isn't so crazy after all. As in all of Austen, there's a dark undertone to the story--the vulnerability of women who have no money or powerful social connections. Lydia's elopement with Wickham shows how swiftly a young woman can fall from respectability and the double-standard that lets the men involved go scot-free. Elizabeth's assertiveness and integrity stand out all the more given the limited choices she has in her life."	5.0	Down-to-Earth Austen	2006-05-15	13	10	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A14Q6TPLQQ6YM9	Malia	"Where to begin myself? Well, first off, perceptions regarding fashion derived from the book would be almost nil. Austen is known for not being overly descriptive on such things. Secondly, social mores for the Regency period are usually not well served by most costume pieces.The Regency was dirty, it was smelly, and although there was certainly the veneer of politeness and decorum, underneath was lust, debauchery and gluttony...The reality was far grittier and less pretty than what's presented onscreen or even in Austen's novels1)Re: Bingley entering the bedroom: He confined himself to the anteroom adjoining the bedchamber. This wasn't considered too over the top as long as there was some sort of chaperone there, aka Lizzie. Did it bother anyone when Captain Brandon ACTUALLY WENT INTO the bedroom of Kate Winslet in ""Sense and Sensibility?""2) Clothing and Hair: ""English Women's Clothing in the Nineteenth Century"" by C Willett Cunnington explains fashion for every year of that century, and it justifies the look for the Bennet family just fine. In addition here's a quote from the book since many are dissing Lizzie's hair alot regarding the hair trends of 1800(just three years after the movie is set in):"" ""The front hair is combed forward on to the forehead and parted in full ringlets, or worn dishevelled. Or cropped short; or 'highly frizzed in the front and turned up behind.'"" Dishevelled being the key word.So, I think before others criticize what they perceive as inaccurate Regency period dress and hair and social codes, it's important to realize how large a spectrum there was for various trends and behaviors for this time period-just like our own period today! AND that modern miniseries and movies are not always the best standard to judge accuracy by.Oh, and yes-loved the movie. A more realistic portrayal that isn't so picturesque, and a nice tribute to the original work at hand.PS-re: Cheesy Ending: That ending was tacked on for American audiences only-everywhere else in the world basically didn't get that ending! Basically the distributors over here in the states wanted a kissy-kissy ending to make it more appealing to us yanks. As the director mentioned, it seems we Americans like a ""little more sugar in [our] champagne."" The director and actors actually do not prefer this ending either...."	5.0	Misperceptions about dress,social mores	2006-03-04	25	19	6

This absolutely proves that wrong. It takes the one thing that's essential to Pride and Prejudice, the story of Elizabeth and Darcy, and sticks to that. Certain creative liberties are taken, deviating from some of the expansive scenes in the novel, but in doing so the spirit of the novel is preserved. What takes chapters of text can be condensed into a few minutes of screen time. I wouldn't suggest watching this if you're trying to dodge reading the book for English class, but as a portrait of the spirit of the book it's a first-rate piece.	5.0	Simply amazing, the best rendition yet	2013-11-08	1	0	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2KSOJVPKUVD8G	Mama Jo	"My continual question to myself while watching this movie was, ""Why?""  For spot-on casting and faithfulness of dialogue, I do not think the Ehrle/Firth version can be improved upon.  This version has modern-ish undertones that rob it of the essential Austen reticence and modesty.  True, it isn't as glaringly awful as the Hollywoodized MANSFIELD PARK, but why, since the BBC version captured Austen's spirit so exactly, would one bother to do a remake like this?  Above all, it escapes me how so many Austen fans could overlook the extensive alterations in dialogue, which occasionally made me cringe.  And the scene with the statues--what was the deal with that???It is unpleasant to feel impelled to critique negatively a film so universally praised.  However, I stand by my view that the latest P&P; fails to enhance the public's understanding of Austen's writing and thinking.In giving the film 3 stars, I am tipping my hat to its breathtaking scenery."	2.0	A Fan of Austen But Not of this Film	2006-04-03	26	10	16

The music and scenery and cinematography are awesome. But the portrayal of the characters especially Darcy I can't buy.I'm sorry. From the first time I saw it I didn't believe a word he said. It just felt like the writers tried to hard. They were so eager to make pride and prejudice appeal to younger generations that they tried to add humour and romance. There are so many punch lines and I don't know. Jane Austen wrote a wonderful story it doesn't need help. In the attempt to make pride and prejudice more whatever they just killed the book. Of course people will read it, but I have so often seen a movie loved it and hated the book for being different. You have to be very open-mind to read the book after the movie. And even more open minded to like both. It's not awful, but its not what it could or should be. If you haven't watched it yet STOP!!! BBC first, then this one. If haven't read book, it's a must read.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1B05INWIDZ74O	M. A. Ramos	If you are looking for Jane Austen's beautiful book translated faithfully to film, this is not the movie for you. But this adaptation `Pride & Prejudice' is wonderfully done. This movie has great casting, good writing and good direction. I did enjoy watching this shorten version of the film even though some subplots do not even exits in this movie. It would be impossible to place all that Jane Austen has going on in her novel into two-hour movie.One thing the director did do is film everything from the view of Elizabeth Bennet, played by Keira Knightly. And the dance hall scenes and social etiquette were accurate for the time period chosen, 1797. You could see what a middle-upper class family had to go through if they had daughters. I also thought that Matthew Macfadyen played a captivating Mr. Darcy and Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet, though looking soft spoken and soft on Elizabeth, and it showed he did marry for love.The scenery and music are highlights of the movie. This is a movie many will see more then once. Though Elizabeth Bennet in this movie seems to have more modern sensibilities then the book gives her, Keira knightly still does well. Especially considering every woman that has ever read this books has her own view on the character. But the chemistry you feel from the screen form Elizabeth and Darcy jumps out at you, there string love suppressed by misunderstandings and preconceived notions.... if I might be so bold as to say, their Pride & Prejudice.This book is a masterpiece and sets the standard for all romantic novels, so no movie could ever stand up to its standard.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AB0OUDDU31OQ1	"Margaret Bates ""M. Bates"""	What a disappointment!! My mother and I have loved the book, reading it many times over and found the BBC production amazingly accurate. But this one was so off we couldn't watch it. It was so obviously Americanized and did what so many productions of classics do, they play fast and loose with the plot and miss the subtleties completely. Nothing seemed be right, the mood, the dress, the actors all too modern, too flimsy. I found the scenes dark and much of the sound too low. We would highly recommend the BBC version but for those who love the book stay away form this one.	1.0	Pride & Prejudice - Keira Knightley	2007-01-18	34	23	11

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1R0OIH9YH044T	Maria G.	Oh my goodness!!!! I was absolutely bowled over by this movie!  I loved it, loved it, loved it.....Everything about this presentation was done beatifully.  Matthew MacFadyen is absolutely perfect as the aristocratic Mr. Darcy.His acting, to me, did not present a haughty, unfriendly man, but rather a shy, lonely soul who hides behind his class expectations and mannerism.  By watching his reactions, with those very melancholy eyes, (believe me I have watched those eyes a number of times!) you get to truly know him.  He does not need to speak.....his expressions say it all.  Of course, his voice is one of the most beautiful masculine voice I have ever heard!  Bravo Matthew!  Keira is spot on!  She too can convey her feelings with her expressions and mannerism.  I have watched this movie at least 3 times, and will certainly watch it again and again.  Every time I watch it I pick up some more nuances I had missed before.  The rest of the ensemble was just as excellent portraing their characters.  Buying this movie, was certainly money well spent.	5.0	Pride and Prejudice	2013-03-07	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A10M5ZWXJB4FAP	Maria Lee	The sceneries were beautiful, breathtaking, but the romance was a marathon. One day they didn't like each other well, the next they were in love without all the shenaningas. But the fact that the hero and heroin were so young, in their teens, made this love in a hurry seems believable. It is a good version but the masterpiece in my opinion is still the BBC one with Colin Firth. In that old version Darcy and Lizzie had their slow cooking romance and their chemistry was so palpable that really made me believe them to be in love for real off-screen, the way Collin Firth's eyes shone whenever he was looking at Lizzie, it was so real (especially when she was helping Georgiana at the piano) and the sweet face of Lizzie when staring him back. That scene is unforgettable. Oh my, if I could exchange places with Lizzie, be her...The actors in this version made the most in 2 hours and the wonderful settings made this movie a 2nd best, in my opinion. I love it, though I still prefer the emotional and romantic details of the BBC version.In this version they kept only the basics, even mr. Wickham and Miss Bingley didn't have enough time to show all their conniving dark sides in total splendor.	4.0	A VERY compact and simplified version	2006-02-02	17	10	7

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AOON26IREG3BT	m.a.r.i.l.y.n	"Plenty of reviews here already address the Movie vs BBC Mini-Series angle (personally, I love both), so I'll just comment on the Blu-Ray itself.As a happy owner of the DVD, I wanted the Blu-Ray for the boost in image, and this release does not disappoint. The picture looks absolutely gorgeous: crisp and clear, with subtle yet rich colors. Pause at any point during the movie and you have a beautiful still on your screen. I don't currently have a set-up that takes advantage of the 5.1 audio mix, but it sounds just fine coming out of my tv speakers.Alas, to get to the movie, one must first navigate the horrendous BD Live system. Not content to stack trailer upon trailer onto a disc, the movie studios now force download a ""fresh"" trailer every time the movie plays. Skipping it is not an option. The disc allows no interaction until the trailer is downloaded, and even then, exiting the trailer is a nightmare: FF, SCAN, and NEXT are all disabled. If you don't give up easily you can eventually kill it (continuous pressing of ""POP UP MENU"" is one way), but that's two minutes of your life gone EVERY TIME you start the disc.Once you make it to the menu, prepare to be horrified. Thanks to BD Live there is a movie ticker along the upper right of the screen. Mercifully, this steady stream of marketing can be turned off, but the studios' desire to turn a simple menu into a perpetual commercial is enough to make me abandon Blu-Ray for DVD. The horror doesn't end there. Despite the Jane Austen pedigree, the menu designer opted instead to go with a slick, futuristic interface that looks better suited toFast & Furious, not Ms. Bennet & Mr. Darcy. The DVD release - actually, even the movie website from 2005 - did a better job with the menu.There's a lot to be annoyed at, but at the end of the day, the Blu-Ray treatment of the movie itself is absolutely marvelous, so if you're a fan and you find it on sale, it's worth picking up. Just go pop some popcorn or pour a drink while BD Live force-feeds commercials."	3.0	BD Live starts this off on the wrong foot	2011-04-19	4	3	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A18F0JJ1UJZWAS	"Mari ""MariH"""	Okay, putting aside the gross inaccuracies in historical detail, my main problem with this movie is the complete lack of satire and wit that Austen is famous for. Hollywood made this a chick flick for the masses rather than a deep and hilarious jab at the ridiculous happenings in a society bound by precise codes of conduct. In addition, Austen, in Pride and Prejudice, was making gentle fun of the unbelievable amount of time people spent on making matches, thinking of marriage, and what people look for in a marriage partner. All of that is lost in this silly version.I don't think any of the cast is true to form--no one captures their character and so we are left with yet another flat romance that is meant to coo at you rather than shake you up with its pointed statement. In many respects, I think Hollywood believes audiences are  mindless and unable to tell the difference between a good adaptation of a classic and a travesty.If I had to make an analogy of pride and Prejudice I would say thisJane Austen's original novel = Lobster with butterBBC version = A prime cut steak, perfectly grilled and seasonedThis trite production = Spam in a can	1.0	Where is the wit?	2007-04-16	34	21	13

Having read the book more than 40 years ago, the details have become fuzzy to me so I won't worry too much about the movie closely following the book.Kiera Knightly was an absolutely perfect choice to play the role of Elizabeth. Headstrong, opinionated - Ms. Knightly does these well. The dark and brooding Mr. Darcy was also played to perfection by Mr. MacFayden, keeping his good deeds under wraps and bearing the brunt of Elizabeth's scorn.I thoroughly enjoyed the romp through the English countryside of yore. The settings were believable and seemingly accurate. Supporting performance by Donald Sutherland as the father of five marriageable young ladies was a touch of delight.I give this movie four stars because it is so obviously a 'chick flick'.Recommended for PG audiences everywhere.	4.0	Mr. Darcy and the Fair Elizabeth	2008-09-10	5	2	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A129YBX5BVNW2	"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry"""	"*** REVIEW FOR THE 2010 BLU RAY VERSION ***In order to have this movie in High Definition, I've had the HD-DVD format of it for a few years now - but it's an America issue and has the controversially modern US ending. Now at last it arrives on BLU RAY in the USA (January 2010) and in the UK (May 2010) and it's just as gorgeous a transfer. It uses exactly the same elements that the HD-DVD did - even the same menus - and the extras from the DVD are all intact also (with the US ending tagged on as an Alternate).The improvement in picture quality is immense over the rather blurred DVD experience. As it opens with a misty dawn and the twitter of birds, we see the young and feisty Elizabeth Bennet (played with a magical touch and staggering assurance by Kiera Knightly) walking with a book. But it's not until she crosses the courtyard of her home that the real quality kicks in - and it's a wow. The picture takes you aback - it wasn't this good in the cinema I can tell you...It isn't perfect throughout by any means though. Because they were going for authenticity, a lot of the early evening and dark night sequences are shot in candlelit rooms (as they would have lived), so you get fuzziness in the definition... But once you get out into the countryside or inside one of the great halls of stately homes - where proper lighting prevailed - the picture quality is beautiful. There is one famous dream sequence where only Kiera's closed eyes fill the screen - she is dreaming of standing on the cliff edge - the clarity is gobsmacking. You also notice the weave of the clothing, the dirt on the hemlines, the ever so slightly unkempt hair - the attention to detail is great.Directed by Joe Wright and released in late 2005, the film version was living in the shadow of the legendary 6-part BBC production from 1995 - so the movie had a lot on its shoulders and admirably rose to the task. Another trump card was Dario Marianelli's lush piano score (Oscar nominated) swirling around the scenes like a graceful swan.In the cinema, it was a delight to look and experience - but sitting at home and watching it in real definition is a far more rewarding and illuminating experience. The acting chops on display is right across the board and apart from a slightly jarring ending, it had the hallmarks of a shoot that was fun and supremely confident in its delivery. I know others will cite the BBC production as definitive - but I think there's more than enough room on my shelf for both.Matthew MacFadyen, Brenda Blethyn, Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan, Judy Dench, Tom Hollander - they were a cleverly chosen cast - and Rupert Friend won the heart of the lovely Kiera (which might explain the ethereal beauty of her performance). But it's the stunning adaptation of Jane Austen's novel by DEBORAH MOGGACH that is the real hero of the day. There is a sequence when Elizabeth and Darcy finally face off against each other in the rain - the dialogue is to die for - and should have been Oscar rewarded. As a dabbler in screenplays myself, I can't stress enough just how good the work here is - dazzling stuff.It's under a tenner, the DVD extras are all intact, the picture quality is much improved and in some cases unbelievably so - and its eminently re-watchable.To sum up - if you're a fan of the film, Jane Austen or both - then you must own ""Pride & Prejudice"" on this format. A Blu Ray gem and highly recommended."	5.0	"""...So This Is Your Opinion Of Me..."""	2010-12-14	4	4	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO	Mark	This is a wonderful adaptation of the Jane Austen classic.  It really does a nice job of not going too far over two hours, because with certain movies that don't move as quickly as others, it is very difficult to sit through them when they are too long.  The acting is very wonderful in this, but I am disappointed that the Academy did not consider Donald Sutherland for the supporting actor category instead of maybe Paul Giamatti.  I like Paul Giamatti, but I have a feeling that the Academy wanted to make up for not nominating him for his better role last year in Sideways.  Sutherland does not have many fiery scenes, but his mild manners and his modesty in this film just made me very excited to watch him in this role.  The rest of the acting is pretty good for this remake.  Kiera Knightley does not extremely impress me in this, at least as much as in Domino, but her acting suffices for this.  I shouldn't expect to see her accepting the Academy Award for Best Actress, but we should see her cheer Reese Witherspoon on.  The story is fantastic, and if you enjoy Jane Austen, then you will no doubt love this remake of one of the most popular novels in English Literature.  Very well done.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3ODENXA668OR	Markus Rexon	"After watching this movie, I'll have to admit that it was pretty good: the acting was done well, the camera quality and shooting were quite good, the character's dress and the sets really matched into there respective time period nicely. These qualities would have made it an excellent movie if it weren't for a few problems. I know that it may seem a little nick-picky, but I think that these are real problems that [most of them] could have been dealt with.The first problem is the actors. I think that the acting itself was done perfectly, great enough to make any director proud; but the main problems are with the actors themselves. Some of them look a little too ""modern"": for example, I though that Keira Knightley looked a little too modern-aged for that time. She has a slight hint of a model look that fits perfectly into movies about our day an age. But that really doesn't work in a movie set in the late 18th century. Sure, Keira played her character well, but she didn't really have the look for that time period. Some of the other actors look a little ""goofy"", like Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland), Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), Lydia Bennet (Jena Malone), and Colonel Fitzwilliam (Cornelius Booth),  kind of look out-of-place in the movie setting. In the A&A; production, they had gotten actors that fit the roles and looks of the characters. And here, they get allot of them right, but some of them really aren't looking too good.Another problem is that sometimes, especially when the characters are in the streets of a town of inside a busy room, the dialogue and the background sound of the surrounding activity seem to clash a little bit. Sometimes, when the characters are having a quitter discussion in a more active place, the sounds of the hustle and bustle around them are allot louder than the characters, making it hard to hear them at several points. There will be several times were you will have to keep on adjusting your TV's volume so that you can hear the dialogue clearly. I think that this is a problem that could easily have been fixed before release via a small sound adjustment.And perhaps the biggest problem with the film is this: it's too short. I know that it is two hours long, but I'm not talking about the running length itself. Allow me to explain:Pride and Prejudice is a long book: even with the A&E; production, which was six hours long, several scenes from the book had to be cut out. But they still had enough time to have several smaller events that didn't have much to do with the main plot but didn't take away from the story at all: in fact, I think that those smaller scenes really benefited the whole production immensely. It was easier to connect and care for the characters if you saw more involved with there personal lives that just what you see in the main plot. I know that the makers of this film didn't have six hours to include that many side-scenes from the book, but it still feels a little ""tight"": pretty much just the main plot from the original story is included here, and even on that they really had to trim it. It just sort of feels in this movie like were zipping from one event to another: one moment the Netherfield Ball is just ending, then before you know it Mr. Collins comes in. There really isn't much time to contemplate on any one event: just as soon as one important even happens, another important one pops up. For example: I didn't think that they gave enough time to the whole Lydia running off with Wickham. That is a very important event in the story. But it seems like, almost as soon as they run off, they're found and brought back. There's no time to realize the seriousness of the situation if it all happens in ten minutes. There are other stuff like this in the movie that didn't get enough time: there wasn't enough time given to the character development of Mr. Darcy's younger sister, Elizabeth's visit to her Aunt and Uncle was too short, and perhaps the biggest hurtle of them all, several memorable characters, like Mrs. Hurst and Sir William Lucas  have been ultimately cut from the film for the sake of time. I know that you can't really blame the makers for these things: they didn't have six-hours to make a theatrical movie like A&E; did. But this still raises a question: does Pride and Prejudice really work out as a two-hour movie? This is still a really good film, I'll have to say; but this problem really prevents it from becoming a brilliant, plain-out really great film. But I know that this is a problem that couldn't really been helped, so I can't really hold it againsed the movie that much.Despite these problems, this still a good film that is really worth watching: even though it may have a few ""casting errors"" and some sound problems, and that it may feel a little rushed, but it's still a great film that deserves attention. It may not benefit your film collection as much as the A&E; production will, but it's still a film that is sure to be enjoyed."	3.0	Good movie, but it could have been better	2014-02-11	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AZKFPD6PJXO1	Martin Nielsen	"It's probably impossible to rate this version without comparing it to the 1995 BBC version, which is longer(you get to know the characters), better casted(way better) and more fun.This version is so short that when you are used to the BBC version it just feels rushed and characters and balls have been completely cut out. Lydia is back home almost before she has run away (or so it feels).The casting is not very good. The only one who matches the 1995 version is Mr. Collins. He is really good (although not as fun) in this one.  He is very annoying which is his job :)Many of the lines are delivered in a very flat manor. For example ""Are the shades of Pemberly....blah blah"". She does not sound REALLY disqusted by the very thought. It's like the line is just read without any feeling behind it.Miss Caroline Bingley is noway as sophisticated and superior as when portrayed by Anna Chancellor. Mr. Bingley is almost too goofy but I have not read the novel, so I don't know if he is supposed to be so goofy. But I don't see why the serious and shy Jane would fall for that silly person.Another thing is the music by Carl Davis which I really missed. In the 1995 version every important character had it's own tune which underlined the character and really helped with the flow of the movie(well episodes).This new version is not wholly bad (hehe). Actually compared to many of the other BBC series like Middlemarch, Wives and daughters it is good.

I also loved the music throughout the movie.English acting at its very best was in the movie.  Matthew MacFadyen and Keira Knighley were perfect for each other as Darcy and Lizzy.  They are two of the finest performers in today's field of entertainment in my way of thinking.  The rest of the acting cast were great in their roles and I can't say enough about this movie.Jane Austen being my favorite author growing up, would be proud of this movie that was made.Joe Wright is great and I appreciate his hard work and deserves all the praise he gets.	5.0	Pride & Prejudice	2014-06-03	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3KZGT84SBSTLN	Mary Faber	"I must confess--I went into the theater to see this film with so many preconceptions that nothing short of a miracle would get me to enjoy it. An avid fan of the BBC miniseries, absolutely everything was wrong with the movie. Darcy was too moody, Lady Catherine was much too autocratic, and Wickham was entirely to handsome.Whether it was being compared to Colin Firth or just how much he brooded, I disliked Matthew Macfayden passionately. Yet as the movie progressed, I grew more and more amenable toward him until, like Lizzy, I was in love. It was the same with Wickham--here was a boy who was extremely cute (even knowing the evil he would become) and, at one point, I started hoping they would alter the ending just to avoid this unlikeable Darcy. And who can play a better matron than Judi Dench? Why, she made all other Lady Catherines positively frail in comparison.In fact, the only characters I even remotely liked were Lizzy, Jane and Mr. Bennet. I've always been a Knightly fan, but here, she seemed to personify my idea of Lizzy (though at the time, I was still determined to hate her). When Mr. Bennet first appeared on the screen, I couldn't resist his wry quips and his face when he said them. And though it pained me to admit it, this Jane was much prettier and much more how I'd imagined her than the BBC.When I watched my treasured BBC DVD again a few days afterwards, I was surprised and aghast to see how slow moving and almost -dull- it was. The movie didn't leave out any major scenes or characters (with the exception of the married Bingley sister, who was never that essential anyway) and was over in 2 hours. The ""teacup time"" they cut (scenes where someone is looking out a window, or a sudden zoom on a period-teacup) was not missed.The shots in the movie were simply stunning--the lighting effects and the sheer beauty of the landscape made me catch my breath several times, and the picture-perfect world of the BBC was cast aside for the more realistic mud and rocks. While the BBC did a better job capturing the embarrassment of the family, this movie did a better job capturing the differences in status.As much as it pains me to admit it, I believe the movie is better. The preconceptions from the BBC only served to increase my love of this movie, for I felt exactly as Lizzy must have, meeting these characters for the first time. Set against the gorgeous backgrounds and alongside the period music, it was simply inevitable that I would fall in love. The three other BBC aficionados I went to see it with all needed to wipe a tear away at the end (And while I'm not admitting I cried, the tissues in my purse tell a different story) and the four of us went back to see it a few days later. This is a stunning rendition of Pride and Prejudice and undoubtedly my favorite. *swoon*"	5.0	Through Lizzy's Eyes	2005-12-03	14	11	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2ALODQIFT4V0J	Mary R. Adams	I have 3 versions of Pride & Prejudice movies--the 1979 version shown on PBS, the 1990's BBC version, and this version.  To me, they each have their strong points and I like them all.The PBS version is much closer to the book than the others and the Bennet sisters are much prettier than in the 2 later movies.  Elizabeth Garvie was an excellent Elizabeth. I thought David Rintoul as Darcy wasn't as good as the later movies--he was too formal and elegant.  That might be closer to how a rich, proud young man might act in that time, though.  I thought the Mr & Mrs Gardiner in the PBS version were by far the best of the 3 movies.  They had more class.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennet seemed to be characterized as they are in the book, as did the other characters.  I thought this movie had the best Mr. Collins and the best Mr. Bingley.  I also preferred this version's Lady Catherine and Anne de Bourgh.The BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle was pretty good and followed the book reasonably well.  Firth's Mr. Darcy seemed more human and more masculine.  I thought Mr. Bennet was pretty good, but Mrs. Bennet was far too cartoonish to be anything but annoying.  Kitty and Lydia argued too much for supposedly being close.  None of the Bennet girls were pretty enough and looked a little too chunky, although that may have been the clothes.  I thought they might have tried to cast Jane Bennet as looking like Jane Austen, but she just looked a little odd--not beautiful.  Mr. Bingley looked a little goofy.  The Gardiners were okay, but Mrs. Gardiner made a couple of remarks about the Darcy family that sounded resentful and/or envious and I do not think that Jane Austen's Mrs. Gardiner would have been either resentful or envious.  The music was a little better in this movie than in the PBS version and the dances lasted longer.  I thought the Mr. Wickham in this movie was the best one.This newer version with Keira Knightley had by far the best music and the best dancing.  I liked this Mr. Darcy well enough, too, but Mr. Bingley was even goofier looking than the one in the BBC version, although I thought Miss Bingley was good--more elegant.  This version did not follow the book all that much--certainly not as closely as the earlier 2 versions.  The Bennet family and the Gardiner family were portrayed as much lower class and poor than I think Jane Austen had any idea of them being.  I did like the softened characters.  For example, Mrs. Bennet wasn't quite so loud and certainly not as cartoonish as the one in the BBC version.  This wasn't really true to the book, but one got the feeling that this Mr. and Mrs. Bennet did love each other.  Other reviewers have mentioned the ridiculousness of the ball scene where everyone stops dancing and makes a path for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and Miss Bingley.  I didn't like that either.  Nor did I think that Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner would have gone off and left Lizzy at Pemberley so that she had to walk back to the inn in Lampton.  I didn't like the statue room scene or Lizzy wandering around the house by herself.  However, although this film wasn't nearly close enough to the book, I did love the music and I thought it more romantic in some ways.  There were some parts that were a little weird such as Lizzy staring into a mirror for hours while it went from daylight to dark, and Mr. Darcy letting himself into the Collins' home at night to give her the letter.  And, of course, Lady Catherine's late night visit to the Bennet's home.The PBS version is around 4 hours and the BBC version is around 5 1/2 hours, while this version is a little over 2 hours.  I highly recommend having all three, just to enjoy the different interpretations and portrayals.  Otherwise, rent them first and see which you like best.  The PBS version, I feel, is defintely closer to the book.  The other two have far better Mr. Darcys.  As I said earlier, there is something to enjoy in each version.	3.0	Comparison of the Three Pride & Prejudice Movies	2009-03-10	9	6	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ABN4G5L25KSEI	MaryS	"""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."" Thus opens Jane Austen's book Pride and Prejudice.  This movie adaptation takes us through the lives of the 5 Bennet girls as their mother attempts to marry them off to gentlemen of means.  The protaganist, Elizabeth Bennet, prefers to marry for love rather than security and thus the journey begins.I have read P & P more times than I can count (and every other Jane Austen book).  I have watched the Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle version almost as many times.  Until I watched this film, I considered Firth to be THE Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy.  No more!  Matthew Macfadyen has surplanted him in my mind.  He brings such a charisma and realness to the character of Mr. Darcy that is lacking in all other versions.  While I still love the BBC version, the Keira Knightley/Matthew Macfadyen chemistry makes this the most romantic version to date.  The characters are more human and Knightley is actually the correct age to play Elizabeth Bennet.  Jennifer Ehle and Greer Garson were just a little too old to be realistic as a 20 year old headstrong young woman.While the BBC version is more true to the book, it also had 5 hours to accomplish this feat.  This 2 hour adaptation is absolutely breathtaking from start to finish.  I loved Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins.  While not the correct height for Austen's description of him, he played his role like a giant.  He was the perfect mix of condescension and obsequiousness.  Brenda Blythen was just nervous enough as Mrs. Bennet without being too hysterical.  Rosamund Pike actually showed that Jane Bennet was the beauty of the county.  My only disappointment (and it is a small one) is that Lydia was good, but not as good as the BBC version of her character.  Donald Sutherland puts a different spin on Mr. Bennet and on first viewing, I was not sure if I liked it best or not.  He showed an affection to Mrs. Bennet not really evident in the book, but then he showed the correct amount of affection to Lizzie.  I decided after the 2nd or 3rd time that I liked his portrayal very much, especially the final scene when his love and tenderness are revealed.I have watched the DVD so many times that my husband is becoming concerned about my obsession.  I even pulled out my BBC version (and another A & E version) to compare them all.  All have their merit and are worth watching multiple times, but this version absolutely brings a life to the characters that makes the viewer take ownership.  I will watch it again as soon as I can get my mother to return it to me.Purist will pan this film because it does stray from the book in a number of settings, but one could hardly find a greater Austen fan than myself.  The poetic license used by the director is perfectly balanced with the absolutely magnetic, earthy realism and genuineness of the characters.  Until I saw this version, I would never have called the BBC version slightly antiseptic, but in comparison I must say that it is.  The BBC version follows the book.  This version brings the book to LIFE."	5.0	Will Become a Classic	2006-04-09	26	19	7

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3SHAOQ7FI3JLN	"mattgb1 ""mattgb1"""	"Adaptations of this masterpiece have always seemed to me to idealize the period, as if everyone is always perfectly coiffed and nothing is ever out of place or even dusty. This film has filled in the story's background with great depth and color, taking us into a real English country dance, with all of its raucous energy. We see into people's homes with their daily activities, tasks, and yes, even the messes. The dialog feels like conversations that are face to face, not speeches posed across a giant stage. The overall result is a greater feeling of intimacy between you and the movie, almost as if it's not seen on screen but through a window... or even a mirror. I must have seen a dozen or more adaptations of this immortal story, but this time I felt like I was there, and a part of it all.As for the acting, I thought Matthew Macfadyen was the best Darcy I have ever seen. All of the actors were excellent, but I want to make special mention of Talulah Riley's performance as the bookish sister, Mary.  Most adaptations seem to disregard or even ridicule Mary for her social cluelessness. But this movie is brave enough to let us see her in greater depth and compassion, as a girl whose cluelessness is really just an extreme awkwardness, and therefore something we can all relate to. We even see her beauty and vulnerability as I have never seen on screen. In a master stroke of screenwriting, we see her suffer great pain and shame after her embarrassing attempt to be socially adept by performing at the pianoforte, albeit badly, to be publicly humiliated by her mother's loud declaration that ""You have delighted us long enough"" and her crumbling defeat from it. It is then that we see Mr. Bennet in a rare moment of warmth, comforting his disconsolate little girl, not aloof and sarcastic as usual, but holding her in his arms.  In this way, too, it breathed more life into the story in all of its fullness.That, for me, made this movie feel like the story was finally a part of myself, not just a tale about others."	5.0	Not just the story but the age	2012-04-18	4	3	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1QT1VDLV66TVO	may	I rented this movie knowing that it probably wouldn't be as well played out as the A&E version with Firth and Ehle because of the time frame, but even though, I was dissapointed. If I had never read the book or watched the A&E version, I would've been perfectly happy.  Because of the time frame, the story was so rushed that the little, but important, elements were left out and the romance didn't have a solid ground from which to bloom and grow.  One minute Elizabeth hated Mr. Darcy and then the next minute she loved him.  I was also dissapointed with the little screen time that Mr. Wickam got, whereas he was one of the pivotal characters in Elizabeth's view of Darcy and their romance, he was just another character. The characters themselves did not have enough depth, I was not convinced of Knightley's Elizabeth, Macfadyen's Darcy did not have depth rather he was two dimensional, Wickam was only on the screen for a few minutes to smile or frown, and Bingley became stupid. The one character who became real was Judi Dench's Lady Catherine, Dench just sparkled and was absolutely brilliant, unfortunately she got very little screen time.  The scenery in the movie though, was beautiful and well shot. Overall, if you have never read the book, this movie will be substantial and pleasant.  But if you want a movie that stays true to Jane Austen's book and spirit, I would recommend the A&E version. It brings it to life with breathtaking scenery and superb acting that brings each character to life.	2.0	It could've been better	2006-03-13	20	8	12
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AXQ8T2D9IT6UG	"M. B. Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa..."	"I read ""Pride and prejudice"" (1813) more than 15 years ago, and I loved it immediately. I didn't know who Jane Austen was, but I risked disappointment and tried a ""new"" author. Truth to be told, I found a book that became one of my favourites, due to the fact that it is well-written, but also thoroughly entertaining.I must say that I was a little afraid to watch this movie, due to the undeniable fact that literary adaptations can sometimes go sour. Thankfully, that isn't the case in this occasion, because the director, Joe Wright, somehow managed to capture the essence of the book. I suppose the excellent cast must have helped him in that endeavour. All the actors are remarkably good, but some are specially noteworthy. I think I should at least mention Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet, Matthew Macfadyen as the handsome Mr. Darcy, and Brenda Blethyn as the kind of mother you are thankful not to have :)The plot is not overly complicated, and it tackles wonderfully themes such as relationships, love, class distinctions, and of course pride and prejudice, all from the point of view of what happened in 18th century England. The story begins in the small town where the Bennets live. Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) has five daughters, and her mission in life is marrying them off. Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) is an intellectual, who often escapes to his library in search of silence and to avoid Mrs. Bennet's nonsense. The two more important daughters, from the point of view of the story, are probably the eldest, the beautiful Jane (Rosamund Pike) and the second, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) who is very witty but perhaps too proud.The dynamics of the town are changed when a single man of large fortune, Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), arrives to Netherfield Park, an estate not far from town. Mr. Bingley comes with a friend, Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), and the Bennets meet both at a ball. While Mr. Bingley immediately caughts Jane's eye, and is considered nice by Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy has not such luck. By sheer chance, Elizabeth overhears him making a negative comment on her, something that hurts her pride and spurs her to consider him a hateful man. But will that change? And if so, how?Discovering that is likely to be fun for the spectator, unless he is a perfectionist looking for inconsistencies between the film and the book. There are quite a few, it is true, but I firmly believe that is not important if the essence of what makes ""Pride and Prejudice"" a classic is present in the movie. And in my opinion, it is... Highly recommended :)Belen AlcatPS: Of course, if you want to enjoy this film even more, read the book too. Even though the director and the cast successfully captured the essence of ""Pride and Prejudice"", there is still a lot you will be missing if you don`t do that."	5.0	Excellent, but please read the book too...	2006-02-05	18	14	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A13SDI9ICQZFAV	MB	"Just as the ""modernized"" version of Emma was entitled Clueless NOT  Emma, this movie should have been given another name. It may have nice scenes of the countryside and sweeping music but it is untrue to Austen's intent and the feel of her Pride and Prejudice. The story is choppy and feels rushed, no time for character development- and what you do see of the characters are totally off base from Austen's beautifully written ones.  Aside from a couple of decent performances (Judi Dench for one), the casting, acting, an writing are terrible.  Elizabeth's strong will and stubborness are portrayed by K. Knightly as impetuous temper and Darcy's restrained pride as sullen disdain that becomes pathetic when he inexplicably falls for her. There are SO many problems with this film as P&P- just watch the BBC version to see the difference. I was really excited to see this film and then was extremely disappointed!

The cameraman couldn't get his eyes off Keira Knightley. In the big watershed moments, we go to a larger than life close up of Ms. Knightley and then to a distant view of Mr. Darcy.  How can we feel the strength of the scene that way? Matthew Macfadyen never stood a chance as Darcy.  Too bad. We never really got to see him.	3.0	Too much Keira Knightley	2009-08-19	3	1	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AFJCOP0GKZH6C	M. B. Trapp	"I've never read anything by Jane Austen, and I suspect I never will. Thus I have no idea whether Joe Wright's version of Pride and Prejudice is an accurate translation of the novel to film. But I do know that it's one of the best films my wife and I have watched together in a long time. The film was like a breath of fresh air to me; I found something almost shocking about the culture of love and marriage the film depicts. As I watched the movie, I couldn't refrain from contrasting the drama of Victorian courtship with the oversexed, hypersensual culture of ""courtship"" (so-called) that characterizes today's young people.As for the merits of the film itself, Wright does a fantastic job of whittling down Austen's apparently complicated plot into a coherent narrative. The cinematography is striking as well. When the movie opened up with a slow, Malick-esque reveal of a sunrise over a stand of trees, I immediately knew there was something special going on. There is one shot at a ball where the camera goes from room to room, picking up conversations and characters as they move about, backtracking and picking them up again as they socialize and dramatize. I didn't count, but I think the shot was at least six to eight minutes long. This is a very difficult shot to accomplish, as multiple actors have to hit their lines and their positions in a very crowded area right on time, and if someone flubs their part, that's an eight-minute take that just went down the drain. This kind of shot is the mark of a patient and creative filmmaker.The largely British cast is also phenomenal. I usually consider Keira Knightley to be the queen of overacting, but here her personality is perfect for Lizzie Bennett. I've never heard of the actor playing Mr. Darcy, but I instantly knew I wanted to see him in other films. He has a weighty screen presence about him that's a joy to watch. My wife immediately declared Pride and Prejudice to be one of her favorite movies of all time, and as for love stories, I'd have to agree. It's not only good entertainment, it showcases a picture of love and romance that all young people would benefit from seeing, especially girls. We'll be showing it to our daughter when she enters the dating world as a counterbalance to the false messages about love and romance the world gives her."	5.0	An instant classic love story	2006-06-22	10	5	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AB0TVPARYLYA1	mcbrair	Thought it only made sense to give this a whirl as I've read all the Austen books numerous times and seen all the other productions.  I was never a big Keira Knightley fan, but after this . . .  What's worse, I was completely baffled by Donald Sutherland's performance, especially at the end.  The engagement scene between him and Lizzy made it look as though perhaps psychotropic medications had come too late for Mr. Bennet.  There's so little of Jane Austen's intent and so little left of the characters, they basically borrowed some names and an ending.  I was appalled at the shot of the pig testicles, and I knew at that point we had the commercially-mauled version of a classic.  Jane Austen was a phenomenal writer, and her characters were well developed, and this film can not explain ANY of its characters or their actions.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A15TMW8RWR54UF	"M. Clemmensen ""Mary"""	"I must admit I was stunned to read the various scathing reviews of this movie, since I absolutely do not agree with them.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film and strongly feel it stood up quite well to the much-lauded 1995 BBC mini-series, even though it seems patently unfair to use another film version (which contained its own fair share of casting mistakes and flaws) as the benchmark to judge another.First, Keira Knightley gives a remarkably convincing performance (reflected by the fact that she received well-deserved Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for this role) as the ""not yet 21 [years old]"" Elizabeth Bennet.  Knightley was not only physically suited to play the part of Elizabeth, but she absolutely managed to capture some the spirit/petulance that is as much a part of the personality of the Austen heroine as the sharp intelligence and wit that traditionally characterizes Lizzie.  Knightley particularly shines in the well-directed rainy scene in which she lambastes Mr. Darcy, following his reluctant marriage proposal to her; Knightley is articulate and passionate in the scene and clearly demonstrates she is not only a photogenic presence on-screen, but has the chops for acting, as well.I was initially ambivalent about Matthew Macfayden's portrayal of Mr. Darcy, but after watching the movie a second time, I found Macfayden's interpretation of the character to be fresh and compelling. Macfayden's distant, slightly awkward Darcy works well opposite Knightley's fiery Lizzie.  The mutual attraction between the two characters is palpable, but clearly hampered by their strong personalities and the proper decorum dictated by the period.I particularly enjoyed the glimpse into early 19th Century life in rural England that this movie provided.  In other film interpretations of Austen's classic novel, the Bennets lived on a lavish (and hence somewhat unlikely), extremely formal and upscale style, which quite frankly, did not seem consistent with the family's alleged circumstances and situation.  In this particular film version, all of the Bennet girls looked lovely (for instance) when turned out in style (with curled hair and fresh frocks) to attend the ball at Netherfield; however, when the viewer is permitted a peek into everyday life in the Bennet household, the house itself is not only rather topsy-turvy, the Bennet sisters themselves are slightly disheveled--their clothes are suited for doing light housework and their hairstyles are mussed and flyaway as would be suited to the quiet and unpretentious lives they lead in the country.The supporting cast is excellent; standouts would include: Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet; Dame Judi Dench as the formidable Lady Catherine de Bourg; and Rosamund Pike who plays, as well as looks the part of Jane Bennet.  This movie version of the much-loved Austen classic stands well on it own merits and does not disappoint; it is beautifully filmed on location in various parts of England and is definitely well worth seeing."	5.0	An Intelligent and Romantic Film	2007-09-19	4	3	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	I have not read the book.I have not seen any of the previous versions, including the infamous Colin Firth version.I bought this because it was on my wishlist, and we had (and still do have) a special promotion at work, which meant we were uncutting the price of nearly every other shop. So why the hell not?Firstly I was pleasantly surprised. After my disastrous attempts at watching some 'period' movies recently (Emma, Vanity Fair), I was preparing myself not to like this. A girl I work with, who also watched and detested Vanity Fair, also didn't enjoy this. But then I was being told by every customer buying it that they liked it.It took me a while, but I did eventually get around to watching it, although was disappointed to discover there was no trailer on the DVD. Plenty of other extras however.For some reason, Keira Knightley got an Oscar nomination for this (but lost out to Reese Witherspoon), which, upon watching the film, I didn't get, considering she mumbles most of her lines. I had to actually have the subtitles switched on to understand not only her, but the fancy olde English that was used. I had the sound turned right up, but still couldn't make much sense of it.But overall, the film was very good, even Keira! Jenna Malone doesn't get much of a look in, her 'big' part being that she elopes. (Not the done thing in those days.) It's good to see Keira actually smiling for a change, she rarely does. There's plenty of great scenery to detract your attention from the not-so-cute guys appearing on screen. I was really disappointed with the lack of good looking guys in this film. Why? You have Keira, Rosamund Pike, Jenna Malone & Brenda Blethyn, don't the girls need some eye candy?I can't really comment much on this, as it was average, perhaps reading the book, and seeing the previous versions might enlighten me a bit. It's understandable that for Keira and Matthew MacFadyen, it must have been difficult for them to step into their predecessors shoes, particularly the much-loved shoes of Colin Firth.There's an alternate ending, where Mr Darcy and Lizzie kiss, but it brings nothing to the film, except it was aimed at the US audiences. I feel us shivering in the UK got a better deal. The rest of the extras are alright, but not that outstanding.I've got my eye on the old version of Pride & Prejudice now, with Colin Firth. Should be interesting.	3.0	This is the definitive review	2006-03-06	18	7	11
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A28CFX00BNG7R0	Megan	Books aren't often translated well into movies, but this is beautifully done.  As an English major, I'm always scared to go see one of my favorite books of all time in movie form, but this time I wasn't disappointed.  Firth is an amazing Darcy and Knightly does a beautiful job as Elizabeth.  They really bring the characters to life.  So next time you are looking for a movie to watch when you are having a girls night in, grab this.  This movie, along with some wine and chocolate, will make for the perfect night.	5.0	Girls Night In	2012-11-28	2	1	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2OIG88PG8K4M3	"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado"""	"When I heard that there was a new version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" to be made, I was far from pleased. In fact, I was fairly annoyed: A&E;'s version with Colin Firth has been a staple of my DVD collection for an incredibly long time, and I couldn't imagine anyone tampering with perfection. Why mess with genius?Happily, I was wrong in my estimation of the movie. Perhaps it's only appropriate, given the subject matter: the whole story of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is wrapped up in wrong estimations of character, miscommunications, and partial understandings. The Focus Features version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is more of a classic Romance, set earlier in period and filmed against more stunning backdrops than the A&E; version: there were no grand cliffs or windswept heaths in that one, but they work here.The performances are universally excellent: I was appropriately annoyed by Brenda Blethyn's ludicrously inappropriate Mrs. Bennet, and Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourgh is one of the most delicious strokes of casting genius...ever. Donald Sutherland as the bemused patriarch Mr. Bennet holds his own in a largely British cast, and was suitably affectionately distracted in his fatherly role. Simon Woods is amiable and open-faced as Mr. Bingley, and properly deserves Rosamund Pike's delicate Jane.The movie belongs, however, to Matthew McFadyen and Keira Knightley, as it rightly should. The book, however involved its subplots, focused mainly on their sparring, and the film wisely excises a lot of the extraneous matter, tightening its focus and condensing some scenes. Matthew McFadyen is, possibly, an even better Mr. Darcy than Colin Firth (though that pains me to say): his Darcy is sensitive, prone to moodiness and shows of the Stiff Upper Lip, but his eyes don't always manage to keep up the mask, and it is this that makes him amazing. When his eyes do light up, it is stunning, because we have learned not to expect it. He positively smolders with passion, even soaking wet with pleading in his eyes. Or perhaps especially soaking wet. In any case, he smolders. Bosoms will heave, corsets or not, when he's onscreen.Watching Keira Knightley as Lizzie Bennet I was irresistibly reminded of another fiercely intelligent, wide-eyed brunette bookworm: Winona Ryder's Jo March, in 1994's exquisite ""Little Women."" Knightley conveys the same compelling blend of delicacy and strength as Ryder managed, no easy feat in this world of one-note romance, and one I wasn't sure she could manage, as I've never been a fan. Knightley does a good job, however: her Lizzie is a ""fearsome creature,"" to quote herself, both fiercely loyal and heartily passionate for life, yet always with just a trace of vulnerability; one wonders, at times, if her passionate demeanour isn't as much a disguise as Darcy's cool mask. Perhaps that is what makes their inevitable but much-delayed romance so alluring: here are two people who absolutely should be in love with each other, but manage to think themselves out of it for a very long time.The world of the film is more realistically rural than other adaptations: the ladies' hems are dirty, their dresses are frequently wrinkled, and pigs traipse through the Bennet house as often as visitors do. There are some lovely little touches to the filmmaking as well, such as one scene featuring a distracted Mr. Darcy being circled, predator-like, by Lizzie and the coolly condescending Caroline Bingley; one absolutely feels sorry for the man. I particularly liked the dancing scenes: there is always something going on with someone familiar in the corner of the frame, lending the scenes a pleasant intimacy that suits the material nicely.Ultimately, I love this story so much because its romantic heroes deserve one another, even though they do not always realize it. Theirs is a relationship built not only on passion - although in this version, even more so than the seminal A&E; version, it is decidedly present, particularly in a post-wedding scene at Pemberley featuring (sigh!) a barefoot Mr. Darcy - but on mutual interests and a hearty respect for one another. When Lizzie and Darcy finally marry (as we know they must, long before they do) it is, to steal from Shakespeare (and another Jane Austen movie) a ""marriage of true minds."" And after all, what could be more romantic than a smart, handsome man in a cravat and a long, windblown coat?"	4.0	Charming and intelligent	2005-11-25	342	319	23

There is one scene that makes me melt everytime and that scene is when Mr. Darcy first declares his love for Elizabeth in the pouring down rain.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A21OJ208JYJO7A	Melily	I liked this movie well enough. It's a good version to watch if you're not looking for something terribly deep and like the book, but I would much sooner recommend the '95 BBC/A&E; version, with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. There is too much Hollywood in this version; too much is changed from Jane Austen's original wonderful book. For one thing, the scene in which Mr. Darcy first proposes takes place outside in the rain. That is much too cliched for my taste. And it is just an example of the many rather sickening modernizations in this version.It is not wholly unenjoyable. But it pales in comparison with the previously mentioned '95 version. Compared to the portrayal of the characters in that version, Elizabeth and Darcy and all the rest in this one are a bit shallow, and the original story has been rather disfigured and twisted in an attempt to make it more appealing to the masses (it doesn't work). And the chemistry in this one is not bad, but nothing to that between Firth and Ehle's Darcy and Elizabeth. I say, rent this, watch it, and then go out and buy the '95 version for real enjoyment.	2.0	See the '95 BBC/A&E version instead!	2007-02-13	10	5	5

Mr. Firth might have been far more dashing, but Mr. Macfadyen's portrayal of the character as a shy, awkward suitor whose seeming arrogance camouflages insecurity and deep sensitivity is more realistic. Isolated by his wealth, ethical high-mindedness and fierce critical intelligence, Mr. Darcy is as stubborn in his idealism as Elizabeth is in hers. The disparity between his diffidence and her forthrightness makes the lovers' failure to connect more than a delaying tactic to keep the story churning forward; it's a touching tale of misread signals.""it's worth it!!!  buy it, watch it, and love it!!!"	5.0	wonderful	2006-06-17	14	10	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AT8QGLS86F0P	"Melisande ""opera diva-in-training"""	"I just finished watching this DVD and I am so disappointed.  It is not only bad, it's boring.  The so-called ""youthful take"" on the story results in true tedium.There are a few films which, having been made, beg for the material to be retired because the film is so superlative.  Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is one; the A&E; version of Pride and Prejudice is another.  Anyone truly wishing to experience a film version of Jane Austen's magnificent book should rent the A&E; version.  No one can hold a candle to Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, especially these two twits in this movie.Let me say that I like Keira Knightley, just not here.  I can't fathom why she was given an Oscar nomination.  And Matthew MacFayden was painfully dull as Mr. Darchy.  He had one expression - sullen - throughout, and the switch to loving Elizabeth came totally out of left field.  I didn't believe it for a second.  The two had no chemistry.Then there are the period details which are woefully wrong.  The older women like Mrs. Bennet and Lady Catherine were dressed in fashions 20 years out of date, while the younger women appeared to be wearing ""early American pioneer"" clothes in half the scenes.  And what was up with everyone's hair?  Elizabeth runs around with her hair down, in town!  That NEVER would have happened.  Don't get me started on Judi Dench's hair.  Yikes.  And it appeared that none of the Bennets owned a comb. Also, I know the director was going for realism, but how many shots of muddy hemlines did we need?All in all, I have to wonder why Hollywood bothered.  Was Keira Knightley that keen on butchering the role of Elizabeth Bennett?  Have we really grown so stupid as a society that we require ""Jane Austen for Dummies"" versions of her books?  Or have our attention spans grown so short that people can neither read the book nor watch the 5+ hours of the miniseries?  If that's the case, than I am sad.  This film was a waste of time, of talent (Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn were underutilized), and of celluloid.

You simply cannot fit the same amout of character development and plot detail in a 2+ hour movie that you can in a 5+ hour miniseries. And I think (shock) there are some things that this movie does better than the Firth version. One is (some of) the casting. For example I liked Mr. Collins, Charlotte Lucas, and Mrs. Bennett better in this version, because I think the actors were able to bring empathy for previously one-dimensional characters. Now I won't pretend to compare the lead actors between versions, but I don't think anyone disgraced themselves.Yes there were some things about this movie that were historically inaccurate or not faithful to the book, but again, you cannot fit all the content of a book into a film. Come on, people!! The one thing that really bugs me about this version is the final scene, with its chessy and un-Austen-like dialogue. But other than that, I think watching this film is a most enjoyable way to spend the afternoon. And it might even introduce more readers to Jane Austen who have been intimidated by previous versions.

The movie strays from Jane Austin's book in that the Elizabeth of the movie seems to be the one who is both proud and prejudice and Mr. Darcy is simply misunderstood.  In the book, Mr. Darcy has a significant pride issue and is not completely undeserving of Elizabeth's disdain.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2BHWOS5PUGU78	Mercy Bell	"I saw an advanced screening of this film in Boston and was very pleased, it is intelligent in its handle of the material and its fluency in cinematic crafting. Goodbye to dusty, ""precious"" interpretations of Jane Austen. This cheeky, poetic, even dark new film makes the story youthful with down-to-earth vibrancy and worship of emotion. Here are young people making the mistakes and dreaming the dreams of the young (when it was written it wasn't antiquity, it was life). Lizzie is not a smirking omniscient but a quick witted independent; hotheaded and fiercely loyal to her sister. She is wary of an unfair world and uses her wits to survive. Darcy is not an impenetrable stoic but a shy sensitive soul with high unwieldy social pretensions fending off the outside world. And they are both lonely and have big yearning hearts, so the filmmakers made one great decision -- they let them fall in love the first moment they lock eyes. In a shot we see hearts behind fortified personalities and an instant chemistry that takes a movie's worth of battling with each other and themselves to right itself. It's an earthy move that sets the tone for a film about the people and world behind the antiquated manners, a world not so different from ours.Now set in 1797, when Austen wrote the first draft of the book, the filmmakers committed to main plot points and themes, and astutely represent the Romantic Age and Austen's characters.  The love between Jane and Lizzie is supreme and fuels a desire in Lizzie to tear at Darcy when he separates Jane from Mr. Bingley. She's hurt, she reciprocates the pain, and it is bitter.  Pride and prejudices are drawn clearly: Lizzie searches hard to find fault with Darcy, and Darcy cannot bring himself to let down his guard. Both have their reasons justified, but they foil their own chances at love constantly until they see how wrong they are and are too heartsick to keep going. Class conflict is suddenly personally injurious and vicious. When Charlotte Lucas marries for security, it's a grave matter and she must bitingly sober up a disdainful Lizzie on the realities of their world. The Bennets are too eccentric and improper for their own good. Lady Catherine (Dame Judi Dench, who is downright fearsome) is not just a cold figure for Lizzie to spar with, but someone capable of deeply hurting others. The filmmakers are savvy in their understanding of history. Setting it back 20 years is a remarkable move, because we accept more diversions and variation with the 18th century than the 19th and it presents Austen as a Romantic, which automatically requires the story to be interpreted from a different, very legitimate, perspective. The ideals of the Romantic Age are ingeniously, subtly played here: human equality, gritty realism married with beauty for the sake of beauty, but a beauty which is never elitist or decadent, always grounded, simple, and universal: nature, the human being, emotion.The ensemble and mis-en-scene are electric. The camera spryly edges in and out of rooms and conversations instead of sitting arthritically in a corner. The dance scenes are less about ballet, now rollicking and spirited as characters send signals, flirt, deflect and analyze one another. In true Romantic form (worthy of filling Wordsworth with pride) the aesthetic unabashedly revels in beauty, but always the simple joys of our world: sunrises, dewy landscapes in wide shots, colors everywhere. It has a lovely score, period inspired and without any pomp and circumastance. Simple blocking is caffeinated and given substance, something is always going on in the background. Lively, layered interactions between characters make rich scenes, neither wasting space nor time. Consider a scene with Mr. Collins, played by the magnificent Tom Hollander (a standout here, so delightfully weird. When he jaggedly squirms his way up to someone you want to shriek). He wants to speak to Lizzie, alone, and a bolt of fear strikes through her as she pleads in vain not to be abandoned. The sisters are merciless, Mrs. Bennet delighted, Mr. Bennet at a loss, and Collins prepares. It's all silent and it's hysterical.Suggesting variation to revered characters is a frightful task, but here it's a revelation. The entire cast is brilliant, but the two leads are transcendent in their roles. Keira Knightley is charismatic, random, wonderfully young, intuitive to the bone -- she inhabits Lizzie. Matt MacFadyen is deep, remarkably subtle, but mostly he is soulful. I've long held him as a sympathetic actor, but he shines in this.  The two instill an unexpected exuberance of feeling in their performances.  Neither ever acknowledge the camera exists and make the most of every second they have on screen to project their characters. When you throw them together you get a love story full of emotional subtext, double meaning, and gloriously heavy moments.Because so much dialogue was cut, simple lines have impact and much of the exposition is visual. Epic little moments linger and rain, revealing souls. The thoughts and intentions behind the actors' eyes and words are visible at all times.  This movie understands the power of a shot or glance. Lizzie comes to understand Darcy in how he embraces his sister or smiles (a momentous occasion, indeed). When she talks about love it's stirring because it's finally spilled into the open after we've seen it near the edge many times with half said sentiments and stifled tears. Usually ""I love you"" comes with extra explanatory prose, but here sincerity kills clich&eacute;: parties are fun, a misty field is breathtaking, the dawning of love a revelation, the heartbreak is throbbing.It's a brilliant film. There is something breathless and luminous about it, from its youth and the break from propriety, to the beauty and spontaneity of life and romance, pain and joy, which provide the color."	5.0	Oft told tale made soulful, young	2005-11-23	215	193	22

They employed the same ploy at the ball focausing not only on the leading characters but on small accurances of incidental characters. Brilliant! And the piano work and soundtrack!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2U6UO366NCLPG	"M. Farnsworth ""Fedaykin"""	For a normal feature length film, I think this adaptation stays very true to the story.  There were a few things that I was sad to see change, like the personality of Mr. Wickham, and the more comic aspect of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett.  I do prefer the BBC adaptation a bit because you get the full story and you get more time to get to know Mr. Darcy and see the relationship develop.  But that version is much longer, and has a few less-than-outstanding actors.  If you're looking for a more concise bersion, this is wonderful.  The acting is superb and the original music is gorgous!  It you're a pianist, I highly recoomend the songbook also.	4.0	Very good, short movie	2009-11-30	1	1	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1ZCQNNKUL97ZC	M. Floyd	Very disappointing version of P&P. I felt that the actors were rushed in trying to portray an epic movie and there wasn't the fit seen with the previous actors. The only version that I have seen so far that was by far the most timely and consistent to the book was the BBC A&E 1995 version with Colin Firth and Elizabeth Ehle. Although one person wrote that the ages of the actors (Firth/Ehle) didn't seem to coincide with the characters due to their maturity, one must remember the time period in which Jane wrote. People were far more mature for their ages then they are today and I felt the two fit the maturity given of the times. Also the other characters just didn't fit right either. Given that movies tend to go long nowadays, they could have spent more time/length in this one.	2.0	Pride & Prejudice (2005)	2010-05-31	6	3	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1XYPEWBAT454	"M. Frank ""mom of A&E"""	"I just watched this version of P&P; with low expectations, having viewed the definitive BBC version at least 20 times, and assuming this one would fall far short. I was right... although I admit I did enjoy watching it. Cinematically, it is quite beautiful - there is no dearth of luscious landscapes, interesting camera work, and gorgeous people. (The two leads are, perhaps, a bit TOO good looking...) It certainly looks better than anything the BBC could come up with. But in all other respects, it's so inferior as to make comparisons pointless. The story is rushed to the point that major characters and plot points are glossed over, crises unfold and are resolved much too hastily, and personalities are not well developed. Macfaydan, while undeniably GORGEOUS, is no Mr. Darcy. He comes across as quiet, reserved, just there. There is none of the arrogance, the disdain, the contempt that makes the character initially so unlikable, and therefore his big ""transformation"" doesn't really occur. Knightly is not bad, but her Elizabeth isn't really fleshed out much, either. Her relationship with her sisters, her father, Mr. Wickham, all of these are barely developed. And the two leads don't share enough screen time together to even make their romance believable.This movie is purely for the casual viewer looking for a pretty, romantic period film. For lovers of Pride and Prejudice, the book or the miniseries, it's just another so-so version to add to the heap."	3.0	Pretty, but rushed	2008-08-17	8	3	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2KI4DTQ5T177N	M. Hagen	Being a Jane Austen fan, and especially a pride and prejudice fan, I was not expecting this movie to be better than the one starring Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle (which I own and love). In seeing it, I was supremely suprised how much this movie affected me. Me and my friend could not stop talking about the movie for the rest of the day, and I have been thinking of seeing it again in theaters since then. I loved Matthew MacFayden's Darcy, in particular. If it is possible, he made the character more like Darcy than anyone else has. The movie stuck close in dialogue and moved swiftly along, to get to the juicy parts that we all love (the first dance, fighting with Mr. Darcy, etc). My two favorite scenes, which are probably everyone else's are the fight between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie after she has refused him, and they freeze THISCLOSE to eachother, and you understand the passion that they are fighting against; and the scene in the meadow, while they are in their pajamas. I don't care, I am a romantic and this movie is awesome, aswesome awesome!!!! If I could give it more stars, I would...	5.0	love it love it love it	2006-01-18	7	5	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1YY9CAIF9RM2C	M. Hester	"Like so many other people, I approached this film with trepidation because I dearly love the 1995 version and not just because of Colin Firth. Over the course of the months since this film's release, I'd heard vastly different reviews of the film and not inconsequential problems that Austen fans had with the movie. As I sat down to watch, I tried to forget what I'd heard, the 1995 version and tried to be as impartial as possible. However, it was very, very hard to forget the 1995 version.The good (the things that exceed the 1995 version):Rosamund Pike makes an excellent Jane. She's beautiful enough to fit the description of Jane being the most beautiful girl in Hertfordshire, something that Susannah Harker had been unable to do. She also gives some steel to a character that is frequently characterized as soft.The music is absolutely beautiful. It fits in so beautifully with the story. It rivals with Patrick Doyle's ""Sense and Sensibility"" soundtrack.The O.K. (things on par with the 1995 version)Brenda Blethyn gives a very different performance of Mrs. Bennett from the 1995 version. While wholly different, it is just as good and the character remains just as silly and endearing as ever.Simon Woods is a very good Mr. Bingley. He has the bumbling part down and clearly conveys his feelings for Jane. I particularly enjoy his work when his character says something rather off a nd must put it to rights.Judy Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourgh is wonderful casting. Dame Dench has played this role before and brings the same wonderful imperiousness.Tom Hollander, like Brenda Blethyn, was very different from his 1995 counterpart, but played the role of Mr. Collins admirably. I couldn't help but smile every time he came onto the screen  and laugh every time he mentioned Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Rosings, or made one of his funny little speeches.The Bad (the things that aren't as good as the 1995 version)The setting and costuming looked incredibly off. It seemed as if the people making this movie didn't realize that the Bennetts were pretty well off, as long as they had the estate, with 2,000 pounds a year. The overall appearance of everyone who was not a Bingley, Darcy, or de Bourgh left much to be desired.Keira Knightley is just not Elizabeth Bennett. Most of the movie she acted as if she knew she was remarkably clever, which didn't sit all that well.Matthew Macfadyen definitely does not fill Colin Firth's shoes. He lacks the ability to act with his eyes that helped Firth so much in the earlier version. He is too silent and dour for most of the movie and when he finally does perk up it is far too late.There is a lack of chemistry between the two leads which makes certain scenes like the first proposal scene seem entirely out of place. Any thoughts to attachment beforehand was created by the camera and not the 2 actors. Keira Knightley had more chemistry with Darcy's bust than Darcy himself.Jena Malone, Donald Sutherland, and Rupert Friend try admirably in their roles, but don't suceed. Jena Malone does act silly like Lydia, but with too much calculation. Donald Sutherland makes Mr. Bennett seem a very unfeeling man about anyone, including Elizabeth. Rupert Friend is far too young to be a contemporary of Matthew Macfadyen, plus far too young and eager looking for someone who had led a rake's life.After watching the film I came to the conclusion that I'd rather watch 2 hours of the 1995 adaptation than this film. With that said, the film does succeed as a period piece and as a film is certainly better than most film fare. I recommend it to the anyone excepting the most ardent admirers of Austen and the 1995 adaptation."	4.0	Good as a movie, ok as a period piece, not all that great as an adaptation of Austen	2006-04-19	15	6	9

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AW99SBGWEXP0J	Michael Zuffa	"Elizabeth Bennett (Knightley) and Mr. Darcy (MacFadyen) do not impress each other in their first meeting.  In fact, they seem alltogether unimpressed with each other.  Circumstances continually force their paths to cross, and soon their opinions of each other begin to change.  Things are not happily ever after though, as marriage proposals interfere with their possible relationship, but if you know the story, you know how it ends.Yet another adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride & Prejudice"", and I am told that this is a pretty good one.  The story, however, did not hold my interest.  I am not a Jane Austen fan, and was probably doomed from the start to be disappointed.  Keira Knightley does a good job as Lizzie though, being both playful and vulnerable.  MacFayden, as Mr. Darcy, is uninspiring, but Darcy himself is kind of a jerk at times and I found him unlikeable.  This is a movie I would recommend for Jane Austen fans only.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3NNLPDJM3ZHVT	Michele J Reed	I bought this movie because I adored Kiera Knightly in Pirates of the Carribean.At the same time, I purchased the 1995 BBC mini-series. On watching the two back-to-back, there just is no comparison.  The 1995 version is simply wonderful with a great deal of depth.  Of course, you can get deeper in five hours than you can two!Watching the Kiera Knightly version, didn't peak my interest to actually read Pride & Prejudice, but the 1995 version did.I wish that more of Jane Austin had been used in this version of the movie.  Many changes were made to lines to appeal to a younger audience, but not for the better.  Jane Austin's are hard to improve upon.However, The cinematography was beautiful and I did like that Meryton was shown more the way that it might have been at the time.Overall, I found the movie cute and with no depth.

I have watched a ton of movies based on her books, though, and this is probably my favorite, though I really enjoyed Sense and Sensibility also. The most impressive character was probably the hero, though. He was so stuffy and stoical at first, but as he felt more compelled to get to know the heroine and was drawn to her, he softened up quite a bit. It was aggravating how she doubted him so much, but I was delighted when she started to see that out of love he had helped her family numerous times to save their reputations, etc. Kiera did a great job once again, but I really love the guy who played Mr. Darcy.

High school to me was a blur and I don't remember a whole lot about it, including the details of this book.  I couldn't appreciate it then.  I picked the book up, again, about a year ago.  I loved it from the start and it got better and better, and it had a happy ending.  I'm not an avid reader but this book will always be one of my favorites.  It's classy, rich, and a must read.I shied away from watching this movie because I didn't want it to destroy the book like so many remakes of any kind sometimes do.  Well, my avoiding this movie was totally unnecessary.  This movie is fantastic!  It captured all the characters very well, in particular Elizabeth and Darcy.  I will say that whilst watching it for the first time and even at the end of the movie it felt rushed, but what do you expect from a two-hour movie based off of a 400 page novel.  It's just because I loved the book so that the movie seemed swift; I wanted every line of the book to be developed.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched this movie after having watched it the first time.  I love movies and it has become my new favorite.  As much as the book is a must-read, this movie is a must-see.  You need to own it.  You won't be disappointed.Long live the classics!	5.0	One of the Best Movies of All-time	2009-11-20	4	3	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A362CMH1AFMYIG	Michi	I went to see this in the movie theater when it first came out, and I seriously was surrounded by a sea of grown women who were laughing out loud and hooting and hollering everytime Darcy was on the screen. It was hilarious, and what's better, my husband was laughing as loud in some parts along with the ladies!This isn't a purely chick flick-it has alot of funny parts that help men get over the Darcy factor and his power to turn grown women into goofy squealers. And the father-daughter connection between Lizzy and Papa Bennet brought tears to my husband's eyes.But make no bones about it-the power of Darcy lives on in the new guise of MAtthew Macfadyen, and he's adorable. I thought he was sorta ugly at the beginning of the movie actually, but by the end I let out a hoot or two myself! Macfadyen puts his own stamp on Darcy, Keira suprisingly didn't annoy me but came off quite LIzzy like, and this Mr. Collins really will leave you in stitches in some parts-he was a real audience pleaser.If you like a good romantic comedy that includes bonnie lasses wondering all over beautiful English locales, beautiful boys in thigh high boots and tight riding pants, and their repressed desires that entertain you, this movie is for you.	5.0	The stuff that turns grown women into giggly teenagers	2006-02-21	14	12	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1VP0166SD5H56	Mikah	While the A&E; version is delighfully over the top, this P&P; is darkly under the top. The main characters are too sweaty, too poor, and too coarse. I often wasn't sure if I was looking at servants or the gentry. Although historically accurate, dirt and sweat are more of a Dickens theme than an Austen. They don't accentuate the story, just make it more improbable.Jane looked the part, the mother was an interesting interpretation of the character, the father bordered on senility, Lizzy came across as an average girl and Darcy had deadpan eyes that made me as bored watching him as he seemed to be with his part.If the A&E; and this version of P&P; were put on opposite ends of a spectrum, the ideal would be somewhere in between. As it stands, watch the A&E; if you can spare the time and turn off this one after Darcy proposes and Lizzy accepts.	3.0	Just not quite there	2006-03-22	14	8	6
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2ZX5079G6KROH	"Mike J. Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian"""	Pride and Prejudice has a fantasticallyfast-moving opening at an Upper MiddleClass social gathering and dance.  We'reintroduced to Mr. and Mrs. Bennett and theirfive daughters in the middle of things.The Bennet Daughters are there to capturehusbands like every sensible woman inlate 18th century England.  Thespirited dancing seems to ape theemotions of the Bennet girls asthey wander about.The dance features not the usualsnobbish Brits but rather a free-wheeling group of normal socialites reflectingthe carefree, not posh and not snobbishBennets, their five daughtersand assorted friends.Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Bennet,Donald Sutherland her besieged, drollrather appalled father.  Mr. Bennet,as in the book, is called Mister evenby his daughters.  Every man is Mister.It makes the movie funnier  contrastingthe formality of  the Misters with theconvivial and fun-loving play of theBennet girls.Mrs. Bennet is a  shimmering pile ofunspent emotional fiery. The girls at anymoment, mother included, are likely tolose their heads at the sight ofa man with 5,000 a year.  That isif they're not having a joke at hisexpense at the time.At those moments, Mr. Bennent retreatsto his study, where he has a new plantto look at.Only Mrs. Bennet is a straight fortune-hunter.  The Bennet girls somehow have foundtime to understand genuine love, thoughMr. Bennet seems as unaware of this asMrs. Bennet.  Mr. Bennet seems to havesense you see.  How the girls learnedof true love is a mystery.Jane Austen's novel is set in apredatory England.  A man with 1,000pounds will stir interest.  A manwith 5,000 creates sheer excitement.Austen predates Dickens and the BronteSisters, but the Director has managedto include visuals lifted right fromthe heather of Wuthering Heights andhas placed Elizabeth in settings that justdo not exist in the somewhat hardscrabbleback yard of the lower middle class Bennets.There is an instance or two of an enormousboar in the house for instance.Elizabeth escapes home with a flock ofducks fluttering about, seeming toimitate her. The image is stolenfrom the thirties David Copperfield andcopied again with great effect inTom Jones.The only true snob in the film is MisterDarcy.  Poor Mister Darcy,he cannot bring himself to speak to mostwomen, considering them trivial.  Heboorishly connives to torpedo Elizabeth'ssister Mary's budding romance with thehandsome though high-haired Mr. Bingley.At the dance opening of the film, Elizabethfinds Darcy odd at first, then turns squarelyagainst him after encountering  hismore offensive traits. The audience knowsthat both are intrigued and Darcy may evenbe smitten.There is Mr. Collins, who, spotting Elizabethat the dance, immediately cocks his hat forher.  Only Lizzy is taller than he, his designson her seem more about money than love, andbesides, he and the film are moving too fast.There's room for one bounder in the shape ofMr. Wickham, who, it develops, knows and dislikesMr. Darcy as much as Elizabeth and tells herso.  A frame or two later he has run off withone of Elizabeth's sisters.  Mr. Collins toohas found matrimonial bliss in Elizabeth's friendwho confides to Elizabeth that she hasn'tattributes enough to wait for love to arriveat her door as Elizabeth has.The new Pride and Prejudice is certain to becompared with the 1995 BBC miniseries starring ColinFirth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth.Keira Knightley, who ran away with the movieKing Arthur two years ago, owns this film too.  Un-like the miniseries, she doesn't really have toshare with this Mr. Darcy (Matt McFadyen).Knightley seems to be at once Audrey Hepburnand Winona Ryder.  Judy Dench, almost a necessitynow in every British period film, plays Darcy'shigh-handed and very rich aunt with her usual bombast.Some screen notes say actress Emma Thompson gavethis fast-paced screenplay a touchup that is  un-credited except in end credits.  I laughed moreat this film than I did at the '95 miniseries.I could hear all of Darcy's, Mr. Bennet's, and Elizabeth'slines, but the rest was sometimes too British to understand.Still, one could read body language just as well in manyscenes.  Director Joe Wright pushed the movie along ata torrid pace.

The pig wasn't IN his house either, and the movie was filmed on an ACTUAL house that was period-correct and accurate for man in Mr. Bennet's circumstances as a gentleman farmer. As someone mentioned earlier, did it BOTHER any of you when the '95 version showed no signs of a farm?This is a great movie. The people who play Lizzie and DArcy are the right age for the story, which I thought added greatly to the overall tone of the movie. Lizzie's and Darcy's actions make much more sense when you imagine them being 20 and 28, their ages in the novel. It's suppossed to be a story about young love and misunderstanding and missteps you make with that young love, and I think both Knightly and Macfadyen portrayed that brilliantly.	5.0	Mr. Bennet was a gentlemen.....FARMER!!!	2006-03-06	31	26	5

I absolutely love the book and have read it more times than I should admit, and I love the miniseries which did a wonderful job at capturing the essence of the book, but this movie is just AWFUL. It leaves out detail after detail and rushes you from one event to the next never giving the viewer a full explanation or even time to form any opinions. The characters in the movie do not seem fully developed; they are like chess pieces being moved by a higher power without knowing its or their intention.Bottom line: this movie is a shell of the book. It should never have been made.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AUSATFDSU2INS	"milss ""Yellow hair warrior"""	The English literature gives us a new adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadyen.In the 18th century, the importance to achieve a good marriage was a fundamental pillar for the English society. For women, in particular, it was more than understandable that to live under that kind of pressure and social restrictions was a frustration, especially for the impetuous Elizabeth Bennet.Second among five sisters, Lizzie could be considered the rebel of the family, the Jo March of England, without a neurotic desire to be married for money or to be exposed to the agonizing rituals of traditional courting that was characteristic in that era.But when her matchmaker mother is aware that exists a remote but weak possibility to marry her older daughter Jane (Rosamund Pike) with a quite eligible bachelor (Simon Woods), Elizabeth trips accidentally with her match, the very observer, quiet, shy and taciturn Mr. Darcy (McFadyen).Darcy obviously sees Mrs. Bennet's intentions and driven by a sincere desire of protection keeps his friend from comitting to the lovely and shy Jane, while he and Elizabeth begin a turbulent relation of attraction and rejection, marked for his prejudice and her pride.One of the sharpest observations of Austen's novels is that the rich were used to judge the less prosperous for trying to assure a advantageous marriage, without realizing that they did exactly the same thing. Nowadays, this history of social acceptance, values, misundertandings and prejudices is as valid as it was in past times.The film had the joyous luck of counting with a terrific cast: from the childish sisters of Elizabeth, her shameless mother (a glorious Brenda Blethyn), the prepotent Lady Catherine (a magnificent Judi Dench) and Donald Sutherland as the absent minded and easy-going patriarch Bennet . Clearly, the stars of the history -Knightley and McFadyen- shine above this group. As Lizzie, Knightley is a bubbly mixture of passion, intelligence, defiance and vulnerability. Mr. Darcy, in turn, finds in McFadyen the perfect mixture of modesty, enigm, volatility, tenderness and dettachment, but simply with one look is capable of lettiing us see that his attitude is only a mask.Who is more proud or prejudiced? It's difficult to decide, since Lizzie and Darcy are so alike, and this is why the romance of these two is so provocative. Is clear that Elizabeth and Darcy are made for each other, and even thought neither of them will recognize it at first, theirs' is a soulmates encounter, and their relation is based on mutual respect, admiration, attraction and above all, a clear vision that love is a lot more than what some pretty words can express.	5.0	Devious encounter of soulmates	2006-09-21	5	2	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2U1BL88JRGVXH	"Minal Patel ""Bookworm"""	"from the comments that the Director  makes on the DVD it feels like he misunderstands the relationship between Jane and Elizabeth. I think he also fails to use the letters in the movie to their full extent.  In Jane Austens time as I understand it letters were a very important form of communication, especially when it came to intimacy and I think they have been waved aside in this movie.  The movie could have used the letters to emphasize intimacy between characters and I think that the Director completely misses out on this opportunity. The bonnets were also very important in Jane Austens time especially in terms of a lady's ""natural and unblemished [freckle free] complexion"" and  eligibility for marriage and yet the director dismisses the Bonnet as a clich&eacute; and uses it far less than needed. The Bennet sisters for example have already got strikes against them in terms of marriability why give them another one by refusing them a bonnet? The book also says that by the time that it was written any real affection that Mr. Bennet may have felt for Mrs. Bennet has long since died out.  The movie contradicts this. I also feel as though the Movie version of Mrs. Bennet cares more for her eldest daughters than is indicated in the book, and that she is a far more understanding and sensible woman in the movie than she is in the book and Darcy's objections to marrying Elizabeth therefore carry less weight than they do in the book because she is not as lacking in sense as she is in the book.  The last scene ended a bit abruptly for me.  This movie is based on a love story and I think that the kiss needs to have lasted longer and not been cut off so abruptly and waved away like it was. I am also a bit confused about the commentary about there being no make up available to ladies at this time as some websites indicate that something resembling make up did exist at this point in time. I did like the person who acted out Mr. Collins - very well done, most of the other actors too although I'm not sure about Mr. Bingley's ""silly scene"" (when Jane is sick) seems a bit out of character. I like Keirra Knightly, and the person who played Darcy. I think the movie could have done without some of the nature scenes.

""(College Student and Austen Geek)"""	"It might be that I'm a purist, but I felt that there were a lot of things about this adaptation that were just WRONG. When I first saw it, I was determined to give it a fair chance- I came in knowing that there was probably a lot that they would have to cut out so that it would not be 5 or 6 hours long, but I did not expect some of the strange things that they added instead.Elizabeth Bennet just didn't seem right to me- she didn't have nearly as much sweetness as was needed to balance out her ""archness"". To me, she came off not so much clever and lively as having a 21st century bad attitude.As for Darcy, I was happy that he was a little more sympathetic than he had been portrayed as in the A&E; version, but they also took out so much of his arrogance and pride that it makes you wonder why he was so universally disliked in the first place! Besides this, the second proposal and the final ""goddess divine"" scene seemed like it was taken straight out of some cheap Romance novel.However, so that I do not seem so incredibly negative, I might also mention that there were some things that I did like quite a lot. The music and the cinematography was beautiful, and some of the secondary characters were just about right- Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine especially, barring the odd scene when Lady C. comes to the Bennets' house in the middle of the night.All in all, it was a pretty good movie- it just wasn't Austen."	2.0	"P&P ""Lite"""	2006-05-11	19	10	9

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1S32HU2JQ5MFG	"Miss Jane ""book girl"""	"I must confess to being one of the many doubters, who wondered aloud when the trailers for this P & P came out, Do we need another one? At the time my answer was: We Don't.  After finally viewing it, my opinion remains unchanged.  And it isn't just that the BBC version got it so right that we can't get over it.  It's a lot more: No doubt, there are moments of beautiful film captured here.  But the screenplay, which squeezes the book into just over two hours -- is botched, terribly so.  We know from other Jane Austen films that it is NOT impossible to capture the essence of the novel in a short time frame (when in doubt, please consult Emma Thompson!); nothing close to coherence happens in this film, as anyone who has read the novel and watched it can attest.  Those familiar with the novel will see immediately where scenes have been combined, re-arranged, or re-imagined entirely, often to bizarre effect.  Those who haven't read the novel will be utterly confused.  One explanation will suffice: Wickham's character is not sufficiently developed to make it clear why he departs, and why Elizabeth is so upset when Lydia elopes with him.  All of the important context for this storyline is dropped.  The random modernizing of language serves no purpose that I can find -- either leave Austen's beautiful language alone, or modernize entirely, and update the time as well, whereby Emma becomes ""Clueless.""  As to characterization, I find no evidence of Lizzy's and Mr Bennet's wonderful relationship (in fact, Donald Sutherland looks bored), I don't see much chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy, or much chemistry between anyone for that matter.  Costumes are not period appropriate, which again would be fine, if there was some coherence to the choices that were made.  And why is everyone's hair wild and ukepmt?  Finally, I am told that the Bennet's ""status reduction"" -- whereby Longborn is made to look poorer than the novel suggests -- was done to draw a clearer distinction between Elizabeth's and Darcy's status.  This was hardly necessary, and random flights of geese, chickens and pigs all over the place is completely annoying.  The entire film feels rushed and perfunctory, like the cast is haunted by the ghosts of prior versions, even before the camera starts rolling, and says ""Let's just get on with it.""

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1QV7BSASXZ6U3	Mistry	I am kind of an Austen Purist.I watched this movie trying to be open minded, and if possible, to view it as a separate entity from the book. It didn't really work.As a romantic comedy, it would pass, but as an adaption of Pride Prejudice, it falls rather flat. First of all, the casting is rather week in most areas. Keira Knightly does a tolerable job as Elizabeth, but one can't help but be disappointed in what seems like a lack of depth to her character. Mathew McFadyen doesn't really seem to be acting at all and merely looks morose a lot of the time. Lady Catherine Debourgh (sp) is well cast in  Judie Dench, as is the actress who plays Charlotte Lucas. But that is about as far as it goes.Nearly all of the priceless quotes and speeches that readers love so well are cut out, and by condensing the storyline to two hours, you have very little development of any relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth. The Pemberly scenes are very choppy and all of the beautiful scenes between Darcy and Elizabeth are non existent. The ending is quite week and is a total departure from the book. Add to all of this that her family is all portrayed as a listening behind the door, giggling all of the time group of idiots, without the exception of Jane, or her father, who are supposed to be a great deal more sensible than the rest of her family.Finally, it just didn't really feel period accurate to me. The costumes seemed to vary, and looked as if they were assembled from more than one century,while the sets seemed incomplete and rather empty for the most part.For anyone looking for a faithful adaption of the book, with tremendous actors and amazing quality, watch the BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.	1.0	A fairly Poor Adaption of P&P	2008-09-30	22	11	11

I didn't realize it would be the most romantic movie I have yet to see (from the exception of 'The notebook'). I thought it was beautifully directed, full of wistfullness and anticipation. Keira Knightley has been a favorite of mine for some time, and now I know why. She made an excellent Elizabeth and I felt the warmth for her sisters, the embarrassment  for her mother, and the love for Mr. Darcy. Matthew Macfadyen did a wonderful job of playing the king of romance, Mr. Darcy himself. Never hearing of this actor before, I caught my breath when I first saw him walking to the back of the assembly with Mr. Bingley and his sister, full of resentment for being there and looking down on everyone else, you can't help but be curious about a character as such. Seeing the two fall in love felt like watching something that should be kept private and cherished and to view such a sight felt like an honor. At the end of the movie I cried and smiled and walked out hating men for knowing there will never be anything like a Mr. Darcy or a Mr. Bingley in this lifetime. It is a movie where I went out the next day and bought the book (never having read it before), memorized it, and went and saw the movie again. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD, for I will be one of the first in line. I hope, for today's society sake, on their view of what romance is, and what it ought to be, that everybody go and watch this movie at least once.

And Pride and Prejudice is probably her best loved and most frequently dramatized work.This is the best adaption I have seen.  It is true in spirit and in sense to the original. The visual adaption of the novel is done with lyric beauty, gritty attention to detail and an eye for symbolic clues to the properly restrained feelings of the protagonists.  The scene where Elizabeth wanders through the nearly naked statuary of Pemberly is pure genius as if the artwork is showing us her secret attraction for Darcy.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3CG1936WHZGYK	MJG	My favorite version of my favorite novel remains the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version because it follows the book, for the most part, in spirit, manners et al.  The acting, in my mind, could not have been better in that version, especially in the casting of those who played the Bennetts senior - Mr and Mrs., Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine De Bourgh and others.  While I very much like Keira Knightley in other things she's done and I think she does well enough capturing the spirit of Lizzie here (and I very much like the actress here who plays her friend, Charlotte Lucas), I think the way the director and screenwriter strove for naturalism in this version made the Bennetts and their house and grounds in particular, as one other reviewer here has described it, too frumpy and dumpy for what one would expect from what Lizzie describes herself as being a 'gentlemen's daughter.'  There is almost a total LACK of gentility and manners in this Bennett clan - forget impropriety - we've gone way overboard.  Keira Knightley's hair, while more 'sexy' looking as modern standards of beauty go, would have been considered quite unkempt and wild when she goes to Bingley's to visit Jane in this version.  Her skirt is '6 inches deep in mud' but otherwise we can assume Lizzie had some idea of the proprieties, otherwise Darcy would not have exempted her and Jane from his condemnation of the rest of the family for not always following social mores/conduct/propriety.  While the scene with Darcy walking across the field with his shirt open is romantic, it's not in the book and seemingly out of character with the Darcy Austen wrote.  I loved Colin Firth's Darcy, and I also loved Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier's portrayals.  Knightley and MacFayden do ok - I just term this version the Fabio version of the book.	3.0	a different take on the Austen classic	2007-04-06	9	5	4

I f you just can't get enough P&P, you will enjoy the new scenery and different take on several of the scenes.  What will annoy you is the much weaker, and more bland actors.  With the exception of Kiera Knightly, who in my opinion carries the entire movie, the actors are altogether less outrageous and entertaining than those in the 95 version.  Being that the novel is a study of human folly, the 95 cast brings humor and outlandish behavior to life, as they were meant to.  In this new film, they are just dull by comparison.  Aside from that, this latest version of the classic novel, has a much more lush and interesting setting, and Kiera Knightly is outstanding as Elizabeth, bringing her own witty and fresh flavor to a heroin that everybody knows and loves. All in all I found the movie to be worth my while, as a new way to experience one of my favorites.	3.0	A new perspective for 1995 P&P adicts	2006-01-27	15	7	8

I've watched it countless times. Since I am a fan of Jane Austen and the film representations of her work, I try to see as many versions as possible. I may be partial to the BBC version, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle make me feel like I am truly experiencing Miss Austen's book in real life. Very touching and believable performances.Kiera Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, on the other hand, have no chemistry and it feels like they are carrying their lines without feeling. Kiera spews out her lines as if she had practiced a thousand times and it was just a job to her. Although I liked her delivery of the dialog when she turns down his proposal, her acting is still not as heartfelt as I would like to see it in this character. Not a convincing passion in her performance.In contrast, Macfadyen is such a cardboard figure without expression that I could not feel anything for him or from him. Especially in comparison to the Firth version who had such a way with that slowly surfacing compassion -- his eyes told the story. He didn't have to say much, but you could tell his heart was touched. Macfadyen's character is a wimp. He has no strength or purpose. Knightley's performance, though still a notch below excellence, steals the stage so to speak and overshadows Macfadyen. This Mr. Darcy needed to show that he was a man of means and true pride. I didn't see that here.Also, it felt like the movie was cut short or chopped to pieces. It was missing some good scenes and scene transitions. I enjoyed the way the Bennet household was portrayed, it appeared closer to the &#34;middle-class&#34; of the times. I was pleased with most of the other cast performances. Too bad the leading couple did not &#34;feel&#34; like a couple.	3.0	Not My Favorite Mr. Darcy	2014-03-11	1	0	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2HD28UZ12LO40	Mojave Bob	This is usually thought of as a chick flick, but I have to admit that I, a guy, enjoyed it.  There is a lot of very funny and subtle humor that carries over from the original book (a great read).  Bingley and Darcy are very well cast.  Lizzy (Keira Knightly) is way too cute (the book says her strength is her mind, not her looks), but Keira plays it to near-perfection.  There are long dramatic pauses that are unnecessary, and the time would have been better spent on including more of the original storyline.  If you like action, fights, car chases and bathroom humor, try a different movie.  If you can appreciate subtle humor and dialog, you'll enjoy this.	5.0	Pretty good adaptation of the book	2012-12-11	0	0	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2J382P4YSJKLW	Moke	This film is hands down one of the few most visually and audibly beautiful films I have ever seen.  I watch it over and over and it is almost as if the director uses the natural beauty, power and passion of the landscapes to evoke the emotion of the scenes.  For me, the environment becomes an active feature in the film and I find myself aware of it, not in a distracting but a fulfilling way, throughout.  The proposal in the rain is full of the vital, intense, and overcast nature of each character's emotional state. Very passionate! The scene where Elizabeth meets Darcy at dawn after she realizes she is in love with him is exquisite; the dawn, a perfect time to place her revelation, he walking through the mist with coattails flapping and dressed down to meet her as an equal, the sun rising between their faces as they bring their heads together--just incredibly beautiful.  This film brings together all the artistic collaborators equally, expanding the power, effectiveness and aesthetic beauty of each scene. A work of art.If only the world's political systems could collaborate this way.	5.0	Pride and Prejudice--Visually Beautiful!	2011-01-20	5	4	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3TXAHBYYH43I2	Mom	It's hard to be better than the BBC version of Pride & Prejudice (the one with Colin Firth)...but this one is still good. There is less chemistry between the two characters in this version but the rain scene is great! The music isn't as good...it reminds me of some kind of river-dance music stomp music instead of English waltz/ball music and is distracting from what was going on at the ball. I also don't quite get why they tried to make Mr. Bingley hideous?!! His hair is teased in this film & he looks really weird! I also think they made the family look too poor in this one with not even a servant which I think is unlikely. Still a pretty good movie but it doesn't surpass the sparks that fly in the BBC version!	5.0	Not my favorite version but still good	2014-04-25	0	0	0

What a fantastic job done by the director and stunning cinematography. The music is some of the best I've ever heard. The acting was incredible! The scenery was amazing! You get sucked right in and never want to leave. I didn't think they could pull off a two hour version but it was so wonderful. I do wish it had been 30 minuets longer so we could see more interaction between Elizabeth and Darcy. But this version gets the point across with such passion it makes you want to melt. I think the casting was great, I especially liked Rosamund Pike and Mathew Macfadyen. I'm not a big fan of Knightley, but it was great casting she did well and I liked her in it. I think Brenda Blethyn cast as the mother was a bit annoying but maybe that was their point. I don't understand why all the book nuts say it has to sick by the book word for word.

It was one of those books they order you to read in high school, but just like Moby Dick and Huckleberry Finn, I skipped that assignment.I saw previews for this movie on TV and had no interest in watching it.  I'm really not into movies set in old times and I'm not a Keira Knightley fan either.  However, one day I happened to flip through the channels and before I knew what the movie was, I was hooked.  Really, one scene is all it took.I watched the remainder of the movie and set my DVR to record the whole thing next time it was on.The story is great.  The acting is great.  The scenery is great.  I've never really liked Knightley, but after seeing this movie, I certainly have respect for her.  She was great in this movie.  I can't think of a single character in the movie that wasn't played well by the actor/actress.  You knew what they were feeling even when they didn't speak.  Matthew McFayden was also amazing in this movie. I had never even heard of him, but he didn't make one false move in this film!Although there were a few things that didn't seem 'quite right', this is still an excellent movie.  It never gets boring, and although you know what's going to happen in the end, it doesn't matter because the story up to the end is just so good, and the ending is awesomely played.I really thought I wouldn't like this movie, and now it's probably my second favorite of all time.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3TPUMFNX7L996	Moon Hiker	I was happy last year because I found Pride & Prejudice.I watched the DVD over 20 times and still counting...The first disk became damaged so I had to buy another one and now it's failing...I'm listening to the music CD almost every day...I read the book for the first time and am reading it once again...(No, I'm not a native English speaker.)I read all the customer reviews of US and UK Amazon.com.I bought and watched the 10th Anniversary BBC series.I even got the 1940 version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier.Yet, the first impression was the strongest and it's never fading away.We all are biased to our first impression.It's Austen power, but director Wright, composer Marianelli, and stars Keira Knightley and Mattew MacFadyen did a wonderful job, too.They made my life-time favorite movie.	5.0	Austen power	2007-02-06	8	5	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2OPX67DT21MI6	Moonmaidenblue	Everything about this adaptation was wrong, wrong, wrong!!  But the worst part of it was the casting of Keira Knightley as Eliza Bennett!  What were they thinking!?  All Ms. Knightley could do in her role as Eliza was snarl, giggle or make herself so totally obnoxious that I couldn't watch the movie in its entirety.  Elizabeth Bennett was a high-spirited, witty and warm LADY and Knightley's interpretation was anything but lady-like! Don't waste your time with this version of P&P - watch the Elizabeth Garvie/David Rintoul adaptation.  It's true to the book and would've made Jane Austen proud.	1.0	Don't waste your time!	2010-03-09	19	15	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A26UQ4FD9V778	Moonstar	This version was VERY condensed. In attempting to fit so much into just 2 hrs, I was left with way too many questions. Had I not already seen the MUCH superior version with Firth and Ehle, I would not have been able to connect some of the scenes that moved at lightening speed. Donald Sutherland was a poor choice for Mr. Bennet and the characterizations of Kitty and Lydia were annoying, to say the least. The rest of the cast was good but there was not enough time for the proper character development of so many individuals within the 2 hour time frame. They were left lacking in depth and scenes were rushed and poorly portrayed. For example, when Elizabeth receives the two letters from Jane, she walks around in circles through two doorways and repeats herself. It appears more like a scene retake or 'blooper' than anything else. Mr. Darcy appears rather shallow and immature, as compared to Colin Firth's version, because his emotions alter too rapidly, Jane has no personality whatsoever, she is hardly memorable and Elizabeth shows none of the grace and intelligence Ehle portrayed in the BBC production...AND why does everyone look as though they have dirty hair???	2.0	Just OK....at best	2012-08-26	2	0	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1NRMR3G1MDQNH	"Morgan Forster ""Austen Fan"""	There are two very fine adaptations of Pride & Prejudice already, the first the 1940 Hollywood version with a script by Aldous Huxley (of Brave New World) starring Laurence Olivier as the definitive Darcy.  The second is the recent BBC miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  Both preserved the wit and verve of the source.  This version has the audacity to try to rewrite Austen's dialogue as if to improve upon the original.  The results are downright cheesy, and worse, boring.  The costumes and sets look cheap, the characters are unsympathetic, and the performances are at best one-note, at worst colorless.  Keira Knightley is posing for a fashion spread, but she's not acting.  Don't bother.	1.0	Needless Austen Adaptation	2006-06-08	30	19	11

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1WVV8A6JUAY47	"Morica ""morica"""	First of all, I should say that I am an avid Jane Austen fan. I think she is one of the greatest authors in the English language. Making a film of this story is a privilege because of the material in the book. I loved the previous two adaptations made in Britain by the BBC, the last one from 1995 being exceptionally good. Colin Firth and Ms. Ehle were outstanding in these roles and apparently lived and breathed Darcy and Elizabeth for a whole summer. This latest adaptation doesn't even come close to the standards in the BBC version. It seemed as though this version tried to be different from the 1995 version, and failed as a result because this required a departure from the book.I found the acting surprisingly awful. Mr. Darcy in the 2005 adaptation lacked conviction, and seemed to be bored with the role he was supposed to be playing, when he wasn't trying to stay awake. Colin Firth was far more convincing. The other characters were almost as bad, including Ms. Knightley. The silly 20th Century smirks and childish behaviour, just didn't translate to the period of time that the book deals with. Jane Austen's great lines and dialogue were replaced with many 21st Century lines which although at times funny, didn't fit with the period. I do not understand why the Bennet family was made to appear very rural and poor. They were not poor in the book, but quite well to do. Like Shakespeare such modern adaptations can work, but this one was difficult to fathom. I look forward to seeing another Pride & Prejudice adaptation, but the 1995 version is the gold standard to which they will need to be compared, and not this version.Some positive points:Great CD with wonderful music. I loved it.Great packaging and extra materials.	1.0	Disappointing Adaptation of Pride and Prejudice	2009-05-24	12	7	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A25JF4201HQEJF	"Mostlee ""Everquest fan"""	I too have been predisposed to dislike this hack-job of a story, and it did feel a bit uncomfortable to swallow.  Having watched the BBC version of P&P, I felt as though I were being chased through an enormous theme park, with colors and music (a bit too orchestrated IMO) and what felt like scenes being changed quickly just to give us a scent of what it felt like to live in that time.  All that said, the last minutes of the film more than made up for the condensed montage preceding it. Darcy's delivery of the note was, IMO, more romantic that the BBC version, the following early morning's meeting , along with the concent scenes made it truly worth the while.  If you watch the BBC version, you'll know what I mean.  BBC = two dimensions, New version = three dimensions (in feeling).  And sure, read the book.  I just got done watching Bleak House and have begun trying to read the Charles Dickens book (over 800 pages, no less)...and that might take me all year to get motivated to finish it.	3.0	The latter part of the film made it worth watching	2006-03-01	7	5	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AXAZ996554HW	"Mother of 2, Mary ""nown4evertherose"""	"After I borrowed this movie from my mom's house I dreaded putting it in. I thought it was going to be a long, drawn out & boring old-time flick about snobby people gossiping about each other. I was PLEASANTLY surprised. It caught my attention from beginning to end. The characters were SO likable. Yes, even the two-faced snobby rich sister, annoying mother & giddy younger sisters! They bugged me but made the movie that much more enjoyable. It was very nice how the script was able to portray the way of life back then. Although the Bennets lived in what we consider a huge house they were considered penniless. 5,000 pounds a year was considered rich. Trying to marry off your daughters to the wealthiest man possible was a goal a mother must bear (at least THIS one).I try to avoid watching Donald Sutherland movies as much as possible. He does so much better with villain roles than good-guy ones. Other than the failed attempt to an English accent, I really couldn't help liking his character in this movie very much. In fact, he was one of my favorites throughout the movie. Especially after he contradicted his wife when choosing sides w/Elizabeth in rejecting Mr. Collins' proposal of marriage.Personally, I don't think Knightley is the hottest fox out there but it fits her role of ""nearly tolerable"". Yeah, the lips have always bugged me but I looked past that because she's been great in all the roles I've seen her in. What I found most surprising was when Mr. Darcy first appeared, I had wished they'd picked a more handsome actor. His presentation of the role made him out to be SO irresistible and handsome. I loved the rain-scene the best. You were able to see his big blue eyes & he looked sexiest there.All in all, this was a very passionate & romantic movie. It was innocent enough to let young girls watch. Elizabeth Bennet was an intelligent character & a rather good role model for younger audiences.

I did feel the Jane Austen vibe and think she probably would have enjoyed to watch it herself. The Colin Firth version of this book is just as good, only different. Like people have said, this movie does have a more modern twist to the classic Austen novel. But I don't think that the movie is bad, actually, I think it was done very well.The little artistic screen shots presented throughout the entire movie made it appear less ""finished"" and glossed-over, as in most mainstream movies. The scenery was beautiful and I would LOVE to visit everywhere that was shown.The characters were wonderful and I loved how they actually appeared to be family. Mr. Darcy's character was just as I had pictured him from the novel and although some say the movie caused him to appear pathetically shy, I wonder if Austen had not intended him to be so in her novel? Someone shy can also still have pride, maybe even more so. His pride against the happiness that still came with the inferiority of Lizzie and her family's life? Or pride against having someone not grovel and actually intellectually argue with him? Or whatever...I have watched this movie several times and plan to watch it again. Every time, I find something new that I had not heard nor seen before. Don't expect a movie straight from the novel, but expect a movie that respectably modernizes one of the best books ever."	5.0	Light and Fun	2007-07-18	5	3	2

The BBC adaptation was just perfect.  This film was just neither here nor there.

Keira Knghtely was just plain silly and McFadden just a sulk not a proud man.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AYBL30P5NXNZ4	"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a"""	What a classy movie! This is the successor to the Merchant Ivory movies... Joe Wright does an impeccable job of getting a dense and wordy novel down to the essentials of the story, and still leave time to savour the beauty of England and the cast.The story involves Lizzy and her 4 sisters, following their path to marriage through the minefield of Georgian conventions of 1797 (when the movie was set)and English social mores. The pride and the prejudices come from every angle in this classic and timeless story.There are several ingredients here that simply make this work to perfection. The cast is for the most part spot on, with Keira Knightley in top form as the headstrong Lizzy, looking, sounding and emoting every inch the part. She is surrounded by Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland as her father and mother, Judi Dench as a Lady Catherine to make you wither in your boots (unless you are Lizzy of course), ravishing Rosamund Pike as her older sister and Tom Hollander as the wimpy cleric, amongst others. The only slight let down, and only because the others are so good, is Matthew MacFadyen, who is perfectly adequately brooding as Darcy, but compared to Colin Firth lacks the charisma to make such a character attractive to Lizzy.Therein lies the problem, if any, with this adaptation - it cannot help but be compared to the impeccable casting and pedigree of the BBC version, which is still the definitive version because of its length, which allows it to stick more rigidly and fully to the book. But this movie must be taken on its own merits, and succeeds where the BBC version could not, in the scale and beauty of the photography - England looks absolutely beautiful here. The mud and dirt are all there - this is no stagey drama - but the beauty of the photography illuminates fantastic interiors of houses rich to poor, and most especially the exteriors of Georgian facades, and natures rich greens and majestic moors.I should also mention the music by Dario Marianelli which is a perfect contributor to the movie, beautifully classic while never dull, somewhat like the ivory tinklings of Michael Nyman (The Piano), but not nearly so minimalist, with lush orchestra where appropriate, and lively jigs for the ball scenes making them seem genuinely like something that would have been fun to attend.Overall, I suggest avoiding comparison with the BBC version, and take this movie as the definitive cinema version, at least.- a p.s. there are plenty of extras on the desk fleshing out history and Jane Austen as well as the usual 'making of' stuff, but most interesting is the alternative ending for the US market - this adds a scene of Lizzy and Darcy together cuddling and expressing their love, which seems much more like a Hollywood add on than the original ending, and adds nothing other than some saccharine for those who cannot find the romance in the story but require it spelt out.	5.0	Fantastic entertainment for both fans and newcomers to Austen	2007-02-14	9	4	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A287SA8ODMO21E	mrzm	"So funny that most the BBC afiocionados not to mention the Jane Austen Society are up in arms over the P&P; 2005 version.  The reviews are as condescending as ""Lady Catherine""-- as if the BBC version is above reproach.So if this version is just SOOOO bad and SOOO not Austen, why did it get universal rave critics reviews (critics as we know can be very nasty), got nominations with BAFTA, got Keira Knightley an Oscar nom and Golden Globe nom and is in a quite a few of top 10 films of 2005? Because its a splendid adaptation in cinema form.This is what I don't get with all the gripes against it which I have read.  Movies are a different art on its own, so is TV and so are books.Be thankful that its been well done on the acting level (yes, Keira had moments of being a little too ""modern"" but overall was outstanding), cinematography is just gorgeous, score was very classy and the camera work was unbelievable.  The ""realistic"" approach was refreshing as well. When I was watching the movie, I felt exactly like how I felt with the Lord of the Rings trilogy-- I was transported to another world, in this case back in time.Quite a number of the review reeks of condescencion of the highest order.  Get off your high horse.  Appreciate it for the artform that it was adapted in.  Hollywood spews out so much trash that I could not believe that this wonderful romantic film did not have graphic sex and swearing.  We actually need more of these kind of clean wholesome movies.The BBC was good as a literal interpretation/adaptation of the book.  However, it felt like a play (not a hair out of place on any of the characters) and not the form of media that its supposed to be.  In addition, I found Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth's acting wooden, their lines sprung out of the book verbatim.In closing, I love, love, love the 2005 version. Yes, it may be condensed and is not perfect by any means.  But as a form of cinema, its one of those rare movies I will enjoy many, many years from now and will be a classic in its own right"	5.0	A  few just like Lady Catherine	2008-06-27	8	6	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2YB3TI9KNB9FK	"M.S. ""Classic literature fanatic"""	"While I will admit this is an adequate adaptation of Austen's beloved Pride and Prejudice, I'm afraid that I can praise it no more than that.  Yet again, this is an instance of Hollywood production and direction and the overtness of both overriding the subtle nuances of this keenly written novel and its themes of love and possession.I won't comment on the actors' performances here because, again, the only word I can use to describe the ensemble cast is adequate.  I will note, however, that Kiera Knightely shines as Lizzie Bennett, albeit a little too giddy for my taste, and that Matthew McFayden's Darcy is more somber bordering on depressed than haughty or proud.In attempting to amplify the unsuitability of Lizzie as a match for Darcy, the producer of the film opts to place her family in relative squalor and, by doing so, completely subverts the delicate relationship and definition between the classes in Regency England.Although the film follows Austen's narrative quite closely, it departs from it often in terms of dialogue and action.  How inappropriate would it have been for Darcy to come bursting in the door of Lizzie's bedroom!  Lizzie says things like ""I have no idea.""  ""I haven't the smallest idea"" or ""I haven't the slightest idea"" would have been more correct.  ""I have no idea"" is a more contemporary phrase, and should not be made to feel at home in any movie which claims to be based on Austen's work.Those scenes in particular which veer from the manners and mannerisms of Austen's England just make the film a little too pedestrian for my taste.  ""You have bewitched me body and soul""?  Hardly.  Although it may have been said of Darcy, it is not something that Austen's Darcy would have uttered.  What utter tripe and nonsense!  Even Charlotte Bronte, author of ""Jane Eyre"", was not a fan of Austen's because of what she believed to be a definitive lack of passion in Austen's writing.  It's not so much that passion is lacking, more that it is restrained, so for Darcy to exhibit that sort of passion would be completely inconsisent with the character Austen created.  I actually cringed my way through the last fifteen minutes.  ""'Godess Divine' on Sundays'""?  Don't make me laugh.  There is such a thing as leaving some things to the imagination.  It is a pity that some movie producers just haven't mastered that fine art.All in all, if you view the film as simply a movie NOT based on the book, then it's enjoyable.  If you're a purist, as I am, take my advice and rent this one, don't buy it, and take it for what it is.  If you want to see Austenian adaptations at their finest, RUN AND BUY the A&E; production of Pride and Prejudice instead, or Persuasion, starring Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root."	3.0	Best movie of the year?

Make no mistake, the kids of today know little of exceptional cinema and what it is, or, use to be; but, from time to time one still comes shining thru on occassion.  The beleivability is stunning and memorable, describing to kind of ongoing love we all wish for.  See for yourself.  Walk emotionally into the screen itself and live afresh and be renewed.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A31RYLPTK37TGS	my2cents	Just had to add my two cents on this film....I, too, have seen the previous versions.  The mini-series does stick to the book more closely than this new movie, but with the time constraints of a two-hour film, the movie-makers had to make some decisions about Austen's story. The basic story is all there. Some reviewers have complained about the changes in scenery with regard to certain plot points, the casting, the costuming, etc., but, unfortunately, these reviewers have made these complaints without any consideration to the movie-makers' well-considered reasons for their decisions.  This movie is meticulously thought-out and it takes an exploration into the making of this movie to judge its merits fairly.  This is an adaptation of a much-loved love story that offers a little different twist to the characters, and a little different feel to the period of the story. Why not offer something a little different this time?The scenery is exquisite, the music is SO beautifully done, and the casting could not be better.  As much as I enjoy the mini-series, and as much as I appreciate that its length allows for more character development, it still has the feel of a TV mini-series.  As much as I enjoy Colin Firth's Darcy, and I much as I enjoy his other work, his Darcy really doesn't compare to Matthew MacFadyen's interpretation. MacFadyen's Darcy projects much more depth of emotion....if you TRULY pay attention to the acting, it is simply brilliant.  Just with his eyes alone, MacFadyen brings so much more human sensitivity and vulnerability to the role than Firth does. Even a wealthy upper-class gentleman is human. The rest of the cast is phenomenal, as well....so much so that I find it laughable that any reviewer of this film would suggest that the casting/acting in the mini-series is better.  It is good, but there's just simply no comparison.If you do choose to see this film, or have seen it, watch it a second time on DVD with the director's commentary. It's very interesting.The only issue I have with this adaptation of such a timeless and beloved story is that it isn't longer.  A truly wonderful film.	5.0	I've read all of the reviews...now here's mine	2006-03-27	11	9	2

The movie includes an all star cast. Keira Knightly's portrayal of Elizabeth shows her to be a multi-faceted woman who is way ahead of her time. Keira is absolutely charming in the role. It was my first  opportunity to watch Matthew Macfadyen act. His portrayal of Mr. Darcy is unique and brings a different depth to the character. He shows Mr. Darcy to be a  very strong but sensitive and compassionate character. I am now a great fan of him and follow his other movies. as well.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2UQRGS1NFMRT3	"Nancy E. Merrill ""Lit lover in Utah"""	Aside from that, this is a lovely adaptation. As to the complaints about cuts and re-working of scenes, the film makers didn't have the luxury of five hours to tell the tale verbatum. I took my two nephews (age 16 & 14) to see this, and they both liked it. The older one is an avid reader who had been told by an older brother that Austen was dry and boring, so he expected to hate the movie going in and didn't. Now he's reading Austen and enjoying it. So where is the harm in knowing this is an adaptation and won't be completely faithful to the book? If you want a completely faithful version of the book, read the book.As to the particulars about my choice of rating: Keira Knightly is lovely as Elizabeth without outshining Rosamund Pike in beauty as Jane. Matthew Macfadyen does an outstanding job of showing us what Mr. Darcy is feeling and thinking. There's no other way to portray it in a movie; in the book, Austen puts us into his head so he doesn't have to show it. Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn shine as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, presenting them as warm, real human beings rather than charactures. And Tom Hollander gives an amazing and completely different read on Mr. Collins. Usually played as a complete buffoon, here he is an ackward misanthrope who seems aware of the fact that there's something not quite right with how he comes across. It would have been nice if Judi Dench's scenes as Lady Catherine hadn't been cut so much, but there's that time restraint coming into play. Plus, you can't have everything.As to this DVD: Nice rendering. Good picture. Lovely sound. I only wish that the extras were a little more beefed up. I was sad to find no deleted scenes. However, the behind-the-scenes and interviews with the cast and crew are extensive and well done.Also recommended DVDs: BBC version, North & South (Elizabeth Gaskell), Wives & Daughters (also Gaskell), Sense and Sensibility (Emma Thompson version)	5.0	If it gets people reading Austen, what's to complain about?	2006-03-03	5	4	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1QW8PYKOQNR1J	nancy	it is a truth universally acknowledged ... that no other film adaptation can ever measure up to the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, at least according to austen purists.  and i agree.therefore, i will not attempt to compare this film to its predecessors but rather just review it on its own merits.i like this new adaptation.  it is quite a different take of the novel.  it is a grittier rural england that gives the story a bit more realism.  unlike other period adaptations that tend to be very picturesque and clean depicting a very ideal world, the setting, particularly of the bennet household, gives it a more genuine feel.keira's lizzie & matthew's darcy have such a wicked chemistry when they're together, that alone is worth buying the DVD.  knightley's performance is a bit stilted in some scenes but overall, she conveyed a delightfully strong-willed and witty lizzie.  macfadyen, who had very big shoes to fill, i think did a good job with the material he was given.  he brought a vulnerability to darcy, played quite well by macfadyen ... man, that voice ...  mr. collins, who was always one of my favorite characters, was delightful.a lot of liberty was taken transforming lizzie's character from a very open character throughout the novel to one of an open but gradually secretive character in the movie.  but still, it is consistent with the particular flavor of this adaptation.the film certainly lost a lot of the witty dialogues that made the novel the literary work of art that it is.  however, there was enough to still carry the movie through.i would have loved to see more scenes that showed darcy becoming more attracted to lizzie and vice versa, but i suppose it was effectively maneuvered & compensated by the two actors by making the viewer feel that whenever they were together, they seem to be only aware of each other.one of my disappointments is mr. bingley's character.  i thought mr. bingley could've been portrayed better.  same goes for mr. wickham's character.  although rupert friend's acting was barely tolerable, so i suppose i should be thankful that i was not forced to see more of it.  also, the two youngest girls annoyingly overdid their giggles, most likely due to the fact that they had nothing much to say throughout the entire film.all in all this is a delightful movie.  i watched it expecting to be disappointed but was pleasantly surprised that i liked it.  i may yet watch it again.	4.0	this movie is wicked ... despite its flaws	2006-03-16	17	12	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2S0LBS0S21GPG	"Neil Benson ""neilbco"""	Keira Knightly brings Elizabeth Bennett to life as she weaves her way through the stifled structure of the early years of 19th century England. The movie's great vitality draws the viewer enter the world that Jane Austen vividly depicted. While her sisters manage to get themselves married, Elizabeth refuses to adhere to the &#34;rules&#34; of polite society.  Her pride matches the prejudices of the world in which she finds himself.  Her relationship with Mister Darcy appears more like a fencing match than a romance. Along the way, she gets into a jaw to jaw verbal fight with Judi Dench that is a joy to behold. In the end, everything works out as it is supposed to, but not without twists and turns and a surprise ending. This is a movie well worth owning because you will want to watch more than once.	5.0	A superb movie.	2014-01-01	0	0	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A23088XC654ZBW	Neil J. Hartzheim	"I cannot believe anyone rated this movie with more than 2 stars.  I also can't believe that anyone other than a marketer of the film would say that it is ""easily on a par"" with the BBC version.This version is thin and shallow.  No character gets developed.  Many that are present are protrayed incorrectly.  Mr. Bennet seems to actually respect his wife.  That alone is unbelievable.  Then the writers can't seem to decide how to play the dialogue.  Characters alternately use a more natural style of english and then suddenly lurch back into the more formal language of the book.  They would have done my ears a service by choosing one way or the other.And some of the artistic license is amazing.  That Lady Catherine would travel 50 miles in the middle of the night to confront Elizabeth in front of her entire family.  Or Mr. Darcy delivering his explanatory letter to Elizabeth also at night by appearing almost as an apparition in her room.There are more items I could mention but to get to the point, I thought this version was laughable.  Anyone who does not know Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and watches this, has not seen Pride and Prejudice.  They will have hardly even seen an imitation of the story.  Do yourself a favor.  Read the book and stay away from this movie."	1.0	I must differ	2006-02-28	43	29	14
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3D7IOLEEBNQRV	Nena	I bought this DVD when it just came out.  I watched it and did not like it.  I just finished reading the book - again - and watching all the DVD's I own.  I give top rank to the 1995 BBC version with the 1980 BBC version a close second.  I have to say that the Hollywood version with Olivier was not that good and had several big flaws- I would not even rank it.  Unfortunately,  I watched this 2006 version  from beginning to end and, again, I did not find much to like.  The scenery and music were wonderful; however, the characters are not developed well with Lizzie being  a big disappointment - she did not behave ladylike, she seemed to just giggle and had no wit.  Mr Bingley  appears as a foolish young man without much going for him - can he be Mr Darcy's closest friend?  Can Jane fall madly in love with him?  Mr Bennet does not strike me as gentleman like - he was a landed gentleman with an adequate income, but a spendthrift wife.  I like Mr. Darcy, but he is still in third place.  I would have liked to see more of Mr Wickham - but we don't get to know him, and consequently cannot dislike him as we should.How improper to have Mr. Bingley go into the room where Jane is in bed with a cold - they seem to have copied the scene from the Hollywood version.  Did Mr. Darcy sneak into the Collinses house to give Lizzie the letter or I got that wrong?  If so, it would have been unthinkable behavior for Mr. Darcy.If this movie would have been presented with a different title and in a modern setting, I may have given it at least four stars.  I will keep the DVD and maybe I will watch it again in a few years - I may change my mind, but I doubt it.	2.0	Still don't like it	2012-04-28	8	5	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A313G6780DI0EW	N. Foor	I must admit I was excited to hear about another Pride & Prejudice, however, I was sadly disappointed.  I know that it's impossible to do a thorough job like the A&E; version in just 2 hours, but it was horribly watered down.  Elizabeth was frumpy looking and dressed poorer than she should have been and Mr. Darcy . . . well McFayden isn't a bad actor but it was annoying to see him pouting through the whole movie looking close to tears in some parts.  He just didn't have the essence that was needed.  Liberties were taken and the movie (although not a bad one in itself) falls miserably short.  If you want to see an interesting version of Pride & Prejudice that is funny and it's amusement adds to the fact it follows the book loosely, check out Bride & Prejudice.Poor Georgiana and Whickam died the death of a thousand deaths.  Their parts were dramatically cut and could have added more depth to the story line.  My friends and I were disappointed that by the end of the movie you had no idea why Elizabeth married Darcy.  You didn't see a real evolution of feelings.  Plus that ending was annoying and entirely too cheesy.	2.0	Good if you aren't a fan	2006-03-29	32	14	18
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A10ZCW781N6A9I	Nicholas G. Chaplin	I thought it wouldn't measure up to the BBC and I was right.  To be fair, a 2 to 2 and a half hour limit brings its restrictions and really, the film shouldn't have been attempted.  Colin Firth runs rings around MacFadyen who can't act to save his life.  Dressing Donald Sutherland up to look the part was not enough to take his acting beyond that of school play proportions.  That said, Rosamund Pike was delightful as Jane and would potentially have fitted just as well into the BBC production.  The cinematography is excellent and the music is breath-taking.  I trust the producers lost money on this project which, coming so relatively soon after the definative BBC production, was nothing more than an effort to cash in.  I am grateful that none of the BBC actors and actresses took part.	3.0	Beautiful music.  Mostly wooden acting.	2006-03-10	10	3	7

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1U4UZW7TJXYI7	Nicky	"When I first saw this movie, I had no expectations. I had never seen any other version of Pride and Prejudice, nor had I read the book. The visuals were stunning, the story was good, and although the acting was not perfect, it was good enough. I was impressed enough to look it up later and not only purchase this version, but also got the older, BBC version with Colin Firth.Although I have since watched the BBC version multiple times and fallen in love with the story and the actors in that version...I can still look kindly upon this version. Although parts were missing and this story is nowhere near as in-depth as the BBC version or the book, and although I feel that Kiera Knightley is too charged (her emotions are all very extreme. She comes off as rude, angry, and overemotional to me.) and too self-conscious (again, with her overdone reactions to things...it makes her seem self-conscious and nervous.), I think this version is much more accessible to the public. People are more willing to sit down to a short movie filled with beautiful people than they are to begin the 5 hour of the BBC version or read ""stuffy old novels"". As well, despite the historical inaccuracies, the filming was well-done and I believe the story is as good as it could have been after being condensed into such a small package. While many would be angry that this movie isn't ""as good"" as the BBC version, I still think this movie is better than many others in the last few years.However, I would highly recommend that anyone who watched and was impressed with this movie go out and rent the BBC version. You will not be disappointed."	4.0	Good Introduction	2007-09-15	3	1	2

I did however sit and watch it all the way through a few weeks later with some friends. (I think they had to tie me down to keep me from leaving) The acting was terrible, the characters were not faithfully presented at all. This is one of my favorite novels and it was butchered! Ms. Knightley did not make a good Elizabeth Bennett, she came off as a silly air head with no wits at all, rather than the smart, witty, prejudiced Lizzy we all love. Mr. Bingley was portrayed as an imbecile who only knew how to laugh and smile. I could go on but I think you see my point. Many key parts were left out of the film. I was very disappointed.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1129LM24YWSZV	"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw"""	What a great film! I loved the score, I loved the cinematography, and I loved the casting.Kiera Knightley made a wonderful Elizabeth Bennet, and Matthew Macfadyen was a superb Darcy. Both of their performances were great. Macfadyen seemed to understand that, at first, Darcy had to be quite an unlikable character. However, as the movie progresses, the viewer (as well as Lizzie) learns more about him and grows to like him. It seems that, sometimes, actors are afraid to fully embody those unlikable characters unless they know they are playing the villain. But there are plenty of unlikable people in everyday life who are not villains. They are just cold, or boorish, or rude, or whatever. There are LOTS of folks with no bad intentions who are just plain draggy to be with.I really enjoyed how the movie stayed true to the spirit novel we've all known and loved, without become a slave to the book. (After all, movies and books are quite different mediums, and audiences change drastically over time.) I haven't seen much else that Joe Wright, the director, has done, but you can bet I'll be keeping an eye on him for the future.Near the end of the film, Darcy comes walking out of the morning mist, long coattails flapping in the breeze, to tell Lizzie that she has bewitched him, body and soul.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3BPGJHALRL8UH	Nicole T.	"This film, I must admit, was my first experience with ""Pride & Prejudice.""  And because I didn't know the story line, everything was a pleasant surprise.  I was so incredibly moved by the touching romances and the simplicity of the time (when just the touch of a hand was so electric), and it was a film that truly made me believe in happiness ever after.  Watching the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy develop from disdain and contempt to unconditional love against all odds was emotional and inspiring and a journey I thoroughly enjoyed witnessing.  And now that I have the DVD and have watched it several times, I am still swept away every time.  I absolutely love Matthew MacFadyen's performance, especially in the climactic scene when he tells Elizabeth, ""I love and love and love you,"" getting choked up on the final ""love you.""  Now who could resist that?  Although I enjoyed Keira Knightley's performance as well, I felt that she didn't appear quite as genuine as she should have in this same critical scene.  But that wasn't enough to take away from the powerful moment.Overall, I can't praise this movie enough.  Yes, it is very condensed compared to some other versions, but I love everything about this film, and I think they kept the best parts of the plot line in.  In fact, now having seen three other versions, this is still my favorite by far.  This film ranks as one of my top five all-time favorites, and I don't think it will ever get bumped!  Like another reviewer said, ""It's the perfect movie"" and ""I will probably watch this film a million more times before I die.""  My sentiments exactly!  Another aspect I enjoyed, I might add, was the music -- I even bought the soundtrack.  It's beautiful and adds so perfectly to each scene.If you fell in love with this film like I did, I highly recommend two other Jane Austen stories:  The Emma Thompson version of ""Sense & Sensibility"" and the Gwenyth Paltrow version of ""Emma."""	5.0	One of my all-time favorites!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A232JQR4NBH9SX	Nikola	"Being a huge fan of period dramas, literary adaptations and Keira Knightley, I was delighted by the latest adaptation of Jane Austen'sPride and Prejudice. It is everything a movie should be, and then some. Great storytelling, an amazing soundtrack, an innovative director and a splendid soundtrack, it is definitely a movie you should own.It tells a classic story of Elizabeth Bennet, a smart, boyish heroine who meets the handsome Mr. Darcy, and judging solely on first impressions, believes he is ""the last man on Earth she could ever possibly be prevailed upon to marry"". Of course, it wouldn't be a Jane Austen adaptation if it wasn't for numerous plot twists, complicated character connections and humorous plays on words.Keira Knightley is perfect as Elizabeth, the role which not only propelled her to stardom, but also earned her an Oscar nomination in 2005. She is everything a classic heroine should be - sensual, expressive and beautiful, maybe even a little more than she should have been. On the other hand, there is Matthew Macfadyen, who makes a great, darker Mr. Darcy. Also in the all-star cast are veterans Donald Sutherland and Dame Judy Dench.Director Joe Wright did an incredible job. Not only did he play with the source in a very respectful, yet creative way, he used many tricks to make us care for these characters and believe their plights are just as well possible today. He also uses the stunning British countryside a number of times, and it is one of the film's best props - it is able to, accompanied by a great soundtrack, reflect the characters' emotions and send chills up and down one's spine.""Pride & Prejudice"" is definitely one of the best romantic movies and literary adaptations of the century, and one you should have on your shelf for sure."	5.0	A cinematic tour-de-force!	2008-05-24	5	3	2

Certain things were great about this film, but Elizabeth was completely miscast, although I really like the acctress.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AUCWDITHYQTVF	"N. Schroeder ""~njs"""	"I am not a devoted fan of Jane Austin, but I am certainly familiar with her work and respect it's overall merit.  I watched this movie after reading a number of reviews about it; the most critical reviews tend to focus on the way this version deviated from the written works and it's rather less glamorous visual presentation.  I cannot comment on the first criticism, because I never read this particular one of Austin's works.  As for the second, I must disagree wholeheartedly.  In fact, I think the presentation of the Bennet's home, clothing, and personal foibles was probably a lot truer to the actual history of the period that many other ""prettier"" historical fictions.The relationship between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy unfolds in a refreshingly ""real"" way as well.  They aren't petty and catty with one another up to a moment when they experience some pivotal change of heart.  Instead, they just seem to start off unsure and distant and grow to see more in each other.  The acting required to pull this off must be subtle and genuine, and I think both actors accomplish this.  This is one of those rare love stories that attempts to capture sincerity, and it succeeds.  Mr. Darcy is not a loveable, and warm-hearted prince charming; he is ""locked away"" and seemingly frustrated by the society he sees around him.  He seems to genuinely seek something altogether different than he is routinely offered, and yet he doesn't fall for the crazy romantic girl (too cliche).  For Lizzie is no such girl; although not afraid to speak her mind, she is not silly and trite.  Rather, she is still a girl of the times--eager to find at least a practical husband.  Again, this is much more the way I imagine the heroines of this ""romantic"" period of history to be--spirited but not reckless.I also liked the way they incorporated the music of the day not only into the film score but into the story itself.  And the characters were all well-played, if not always well-liked.  How unfortunate a mother, with her shameless gossiping, eavesdropping and meddling?  And the cinematography was beautiful, without being overpowering.  It captured the visual beauty of this more simple time--both inside and out.  It is not hard to imagine why this landscape was the source of a renaissance of romantic art."	4.0	A solid period drama.	2007-03-20	6	4	2

The visuals were great, the costuming appropriate, the details superb.  But where was the humour, the charm, the wit and the wondeful characters that makes me read the novel again and again?  Some of the things that I love about Jane Austen is her social satire and her explication of human foibles, which have not changed all that much in three hundred years.  All you get with this film (presumably in an effort to make it ""relevant"" to modern viewers) is a lot of noise/yelling, bad acting (even from Dame Judy Dench!!), and the overwhelming feeling that the majority of the actors were miscast. The makers of this film stripped away all the humour of the novel and left me dissatisfied and suffering from a bad headache.  If you really want to experience a version of Pride and Prejudice with the spirit of Jane Austen gloriously intact, search out the 2004[?] version with Colin Firth.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3ATG9CQV70D7E	Obsessed with Austen	This was a wonderful adaptation of Austen's book. The quality of the film and theatrical aspect were beautiful and very well done. I thought the casting was perfect. I preferred the darker, brooding Darcy played by Matthew McFadyen in this version. I felt that each actor fit their character in looks better than some other adaptations. Rosamund Pike (Jane) was actually pretty, unlike the actor who played Jane in the BBC/A&E; version.I was disappointed by all the holes in this movie. It really didn't give enough information for someone not familiar with the book to understand the background of the characters and the traditions of that time. They made it seem as though Bingley and Jane didn't spend much time together as well as Darcy and Elizabeth. I felt that it was almost hard to believe that in the very little time Bingley spent with Jane, there was no way he could have already been in love and the same with Lizzie and Darcy. But I understand that they couldn't have a theatrical adaptation last for many, many hours to show each and every time they encountered each other. The artistic changes made in this movie were worthwhile. The scene in the rain with Darcy proposing to Lizzie was wonderful, and Catherine de Bourgh showing up at night was fun too.All in all, a very good movie, done very well. I am very pleased with it and will watch it over and over again. Even if it didn't follow real closely to the book, the important parts of the story were there and the emotions of the characters were still conveyed perfectly. I am quite satisfied and anyone who is an Austen fan should add this to their collection.	4.0	Beautiful Adaptation, not complete though	2006-06-09	9	6	3

And... wait a moment, I've just run out compliments. In general, I thought this was a terrible adaptation of the Jane Austen novel. There were so many things wrong with it that I hardly know where to begin, and it would make tiresome reading if I were to list all of the film's faults. However, in brief...The film is hampered at the get-go by its very abbreviated running time of just over two hours. This is far too short to do the book any kind of justice, my opinion being that the best way to adapt classic novels on film is in the form of a television mini-series, where the producers can spend three, or four, or six hours to tell the story properly. Far too much material was condensed or cut entirely in this film, for it to be a satisfactory adaptation in any way.But that's just the beginning... another major problem is that nearly every character is portrayed in a way that is absolutely contrary to their personalities as depicted in the novel. Some examples... Mr Bingley, with his moronic grin, complete inability to carry on a simple conversation, and bizarrely wild hair-style, seems primed to take up the office of village idiot (that, or he may be slightly insane; either way, it's difficult to see why Jane admires him). Elizabeth comes across as rude and shrewish in several scenes, and Mrs Bennet (while dead common) appears to be a rather sensible and practical woman, instead of a featherbrain. Mr Darcy is melancholy and brooding, instead of proud and arrogant, and Mr Collins is dull and studious instead of obsequious and ridiculous. Miss Darcy is outgoing and vivacious instead of shy and retiring---etc., etc...Scenes containing important bits of dialogue have been transposed to incongruous locations that are ill-suited for the purpose, and there are many period details that are utterly incorrect. (Let's not even discuss the unattractive costuming; Keira Knightley goes through much of the film looking like she's wearing an assortment of ill-fitting sacks.)Okay, I guess you may have guessed by now that I really disliked this film! I'm frankly astounded by the fact that it has gotten a fairly positive response in general, with many people saying that it's a fine adaptation of the novel. I don't know how to respond to that attitude, other than to wonder if these people have actually read the book, or seen the film in question. I don't even recommend this one as a rental, unless one is determined to see every film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that they can.	1.0	Pretty bad overall	2010-01-05	15	9	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ADRVMQCT63M85	Olene Quinn	"This movie really had it tough. When you go up against one of the favorite movies ever, you have to be brave. Imagine making a new version of Gone with the Wind, or if someone decided to do Titanic Two. I remember when I saw this in theaters, everyone was whispering comparisons between this and the Colin Firth version. So, how is it?On it's own, it's great, actually. I've never been a fan of Kiera Knightley, but she does well here. I do think she played the part a little more teenage and a little less snarky than it was meant to be, but I'm sure the director was behind that 100%. This is, after all, aimed at the young audience. It's screaming, ""I'm new, I'm fresh, I'm just like you!"". Matthew MacFaden seems a little bored, to be honest. When he proposes the first time, it sounds like he's reading a phone book. Of course, I may be just comparing him to Firth because actually he and Knightley are good together. The real star here, though, is Tom Hollander. He play Mr. Collins in an entirely new way, a way nobody else had thought of. He is pitch perfect in his part and if you watch it for no other reason, watch it for him.[...]"	4.0	Had a Hard Battle to Fight	2011-09-18	1	1	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A30LMTLC9XVWKJ	Only-A-Child	"It is my sincere wish that Jane Austen readers and non-readers  not miss a big screen viewing of Joe Wright's ""Pride & Prejudice"" because they let themselves be influenced by negative comments from the Ellen Jamesian sect of the Jane Austen society.  Particularly odious are those presumptuous enough to declare that Austen herself would consider the film a disservice.  Attempting to discourage potential viewers in this manner reveals not just a staggering conceit, but an utter cluelessness about how to read a film and about the power of a visual medium.This film adaptation of Austen's classic is the first one to fully capture its essence within the economical and efficient package of a two-hour feature film.  And it does so in a technically proficient way (cinematography-production design-editing); with perfect physical casting, excellent directing and scene staging, and fine performances from the entire ensemble.  In isolation it is simply the best film ever made, but because it is not an original screenplay the critics have downgraded it a bit from A plus to A minus (their acknowledgement of the debt it owns to Austen).Jane Austen once said,  ""an artist cannot do anything slovenly"".  Joe Wright's film is not perfect but it is the least slovenly in cinema history.  I was reminded of this by the film's treatment of Georgiana, Darcy's sister.  Georgiana was a minor but extremely important character in the book.  Elizabeth's point of view observations of Darcy's tender treatment of his shy little sister is how Austen shows Elizabeth's first realization that Darcy is worthy of her love.  Initially I was disappointed that Georgiana only has two brief appearances in the film, but on reflection I realized that the scenes had been staged and scripted so well that they said everything  needed about the relationship dynamics of the three characters.The film successfully brings Austen's ironic (insert comic here) observations of character and manners to the screen.  As the title proclaims, this story has a double theme, the pride of the aristocrat prejudicing the middle class heroine against him.  But as Elizabeth explains to her father in my favorite scene, she and Darcy are the flip sides of each other as her pride has long blinded her to Darcy's efforts to overcome the prejudice of his class to hers.The film also captures the more critical macro element of Austen's novel, the idea of a generous humanness that can transcend the motivations of social class.  Society is imperfect and while the social order encourages foolish prides and mean prejudices, it also enables kindness, affection, and courage.  In the film's movement of events there is a modulation between vices and virtues in which the latter more than mitigates the former.  This was Jane Austen's primary ""value"" which I think  would have formed the basis of her judgment and ultimate approval of the film.Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child."	5.0	Why I Think Jane Would Have Approved	2005-11-30	12	7	5

Focusing on this 2005 film version starring Keira Knightly as Elizabeth, I found it filled with beauty, romance, music and breathtaking scenery. The casting is nearly perfect as each of the characters comes to life in a highly believable manner. Knightly does an extraordinary job at expressing her love of her sisters (even the kooky younger girls) and her father, along with her initial distaste for Darcy.I particularly enjoyed the peformances of Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennett, and the appearance of Dame Judy Dench. It's a championship moment when Elizabeth stands up to her in the middle of the night--as good as her romantic scenes with Darcy.Everything about this film make it a period piece that completely capsulizes a point in time and a classic work of fiction. I will watch it again and again and again.	5.0	Beauty, Romance . . . What's Not To Love?	2008-08-27	6	3	3

Normally movie adaptations of books are more than pitiful.My only problem with the movie was that it was not long enough. There was so much more that could have been put in that was not. Though, what was put in was almost perfect. There were some historical inaccuracies as well as book related inaccuracies. Some of these inaccuracies helped show the degree of emotion or importance, like when Lady Catherine calls on Lizzy in the middle of the night, it shows the urgency of her manner.This movie was well casted. Keira Knightley was absolutely perfect for the part. Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightley have great chemistry and a believable passion for one another.I highly recommend this movie to everyone.	5.0	A Wonderful FIlm	2006-01-26	12	8	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AZ77K7BCBK8V	Padderz	I thought that this version/adaptation of Austen's novel was excellent overall and would strongly recommend viewing to anyone (rent or purchase).I've seen most of the previous versions and agree that the BBC Ehle/Firth outing is indeed still much loved, however, I found this simply more realistic - from the grittier, grubbier lives of our heroines, played more girlish and younger than previously - to a much more 'real' portrayal of Darcy. Shy, vulnerable and as such, aloof.The real strength for me though was the true family that Sutherland and Blethyn create. The girls feel like real sisters, not literary ones, led by the extraordinary Knightley and Pike. Both quite luminous on screen and both embodying the spirit of the age.Special kudos must be given to Knightley though, who here just radiates a feisty lovability and who's capture of Darcy seems completely natural, as if any man who met her Lizzie would fall madly in love.And as such, McFayden embodies a Darcy that I can actually imagine falling in love with a girl, well below what he and his own family expects, and his struggle with his feelings and responsibilities.All in all, a great film.	5.0	A family affair......	2006-10-09	10	6	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3DBV5U109ZKBE	Padraic Ley	"2005 movie adaption with Keira Knightley was a master piece introduced me to Jane Austen world.  If Jane is alive today and lived thru our century that time measures in millisecond.  I can imagined she be proud and approved this movie for her contemporary audience.  After watched the movie and then read the book more than 10+ times each. I had to say the movie adaption is truly great in matching the casts and the personalities in the book. It is really picture worth a thousand words.  The cinematic effects, the dialogs and the sets were beautifully created in such brilliant art form; so pleasing to the eyes and so much touching of the heart.Keira carried the whole movie fantastic well; she was alive with the character of Elizabeth Bennett. Her personality, her dark eyes matched Lizzy in the book well. Her expressions and the looks to Darcy were so real to live. Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy was great as in the book; I grew to the character more in re-watch. They had great chemistry. For a modern generation, this movie bridge to the classic. The ages of the actors were very well match to the stories. Not like the BBC TV series or 1940, somehow their age like 30s years old from today looks. Jane's story portrayed Lizzy at 20 years old when the stories began and Lydia at 16. This 2005 movie made a relatable youthfulness of younger people today.After the movie, I can read the book (free download from Amazon Kindle) with a little ease since this was my first classic from high school 30 years ago. The book was detail and added dimensions to that of the movie.  I re-watch the movie and saw the depth of the director and actors painstaking performances on each scene to create the original mood of each setting. The flow of the story is really well as book to movie goes. Many of the scenes were fantastic creations of the word / feeling from the characters in the book. With the music, our human visual & audio senses were flooded with emotions that the book can't. Then I did research on the internet and got the 18th century England Regency period to expand the depth of this story. That again adds depth to the feel of the movie and the book. Especially those forgotten terms like ""Gentleman"", ""Amiable"", ""Agreeable"" that we were brought up in such a faint echo of the early 18t century.Jane Austen thru her book and this movie has re-educated me the hidden Pride & Prejudice in me and how that affected me in many of my life.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3FBZDOS0SKVIJ	Paulina S	"This film seems created by people familiar with the storyline of ""Pride and Prejudice"" but with little sense of Jane Austen's times or, indeed, her characters. The plot is essentially correct but the tone is frequently and incomprehensibly off.The general excellence of the actors, the dreamy cinematography and music, and the obvious care lavished on this movie make its flaws even more apparent and confusing. The Elizabeth and Jane Bennett described by Jane Austen would never listen at keyholes or shout at their mother or giggle at a feeble marriage proposal.  Mr. Collins was written as a comically pompous character; here he is so meek and awkward his romantic attempts are more pathetic than amusing and make the sisters' reactions seem cruel.The costumes and hair are inexplicable--Kitty and Lydia are dressed as if they are from a generation past, when they are the ones most concerned with fashion and are always buying new bonnets and gowns, and Elizabeth walks about with her hair down and in bare feet.  In reality, this would have been considered absolutely vulgar--akin to spitting tobacco--and never something a well-bred girl would do, no matter how high-spirited or independent.The Bennetts live in a place so ill-kept the animals wading across the yard look in danger of drowning in mud.  The Bennetts don't have the wealth of Bingley or Darcy, but they are supposed to be respectable, established gentry; Jed Clampett wouldn't own a place this slovenly.Despite all these missteps, this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is worth seeing for Keira Knightley's lively, if over-giggly, portrayal of Elizabeth and Matthew Macfadyen's interesting take on Darcy: he's more shy and subdued than actively arrogant (though his stuttering proposal at the end seems all wrong.  Love makes Darcy MORE eloquent, not less). The proposal scene in the rain is a highlight, and the plot stays true enough to the original for viewers to enjoy a cinematic vacation to Jane Austen's world.For the truest version of P and P, on all levels, definitely check out the BBC Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth version.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1QM7NGKJNX1RP	Paul L. McKaskle	"I debated whether I should give the picture 3 or 4 stars.  I obviously chose 3.  The problem with the production is simply it is too short to give full credit to Jane Austin's book.  That said, it is well executed, which is why debated between the two ratings.The first problem is for those who have no prior familiarity with either the book or at minimum the two relatively recent much more lenghty mini series (the BBC-A&E; version with Colin Firth of 1995 and--in my view, the better--BBC-Australian version with Elizabeth Garvie of 1990).  So much is cut from this version that the nuances of what Austin was trying to convey are simply missing.  The three younger Bennet daughters are hardly differentiated, mostly they giggle and it is even hard to figure out which one is which.  I have just seen Carey Mulligan as a wonderful Ada in Bleak House, and it took me most of the movie to recognize her as Kitty, the second youngest daughter.  Eventually Lydia becomes recognizeable but only because she gets married to Wickam.Wickham appears only briefly at the beginning and though he tells Lizzie of Darcy's alleged mistreatment of him, one never realizes from this movie that Lizzie is unduly intrigued by him and is in danger of succumbing to his false charms.  We do hear of his falsity from Darcy's famous letter, but nothing more is provided to flesh out Wickham's perfidy until he ""elopes"" with Lydia.  (In particular, the wise words of the housekeeper at Pemberley, a neutral source, on the perfidy of Wickham, an important fact for Lizzie, are simply missing.)Although Charlotte appears early in the film, her significance is almost unnoted  Thus, it is unclear why it is of significance (to those who don't already know the book) that Mr. Collins marries her.  In general the repellant nature of Mr. Collins is seriously underplayed. He is almost a minor character.Mr. Bingley's married sister and her shiftless husband are entirely missing.  The Bennet manse is presented almost as farm, not a gentleman's small estate.  On the other hand, Chatsworth one of the grandest estates in England, the seat of the Duke of Devonshire, is presented as Pemberley.  This is much grander than Fitzwilliam Darcy would likely to have.  Darcy is not a Duke, and not even a lord.  (The movie script suggests that Darcy owns half of Derbyshire, and nothing in the book remotely suggest this, and if he has ""only"" 10,000 [pounds] a year--the only sum mentioned in the movie or book--it is highly unlikely that he owns more than a few thousand acres of Derbyshire.  Even the extremely wealthy Duke of Devonshire doesn't own more than a small fraction of Derbyshire.I won't go on with the faults.  Why do I give it 3 stars and even consider 4 stars?  Mainly because the most central points, the evolution of Elizabeth Bennet, full of prejudice and Fitzwilliam Darcy, full of pride, are reasonably well developed and are extremely well acted--particularly well developed for Elizabeth Bennet.  A number (though not all) of the key scenes of this relationship are well presented (though in somewhat truncated form which was necessary for fitting the whole movie into an approximate two hour length required for commercial movies).  Lady Catherine de Bourgh's ill-fated attempt to derail the budding romance between Lizzie and Darcy is well done (though also a bit truncated).  Mrs. Bennet's hysteria was dealt with sympathetically.I have read the book a half dozen times, seen the 1995 (Colin Firth) mini-series version a couple of times and the earlier Elizabeth Garvie mini-series version a dozen times, and so I know the story well enough to fill in for all of the important missing details.  With this prior knowledge, the plusses made it worthwhile for me to watch.  For someone is not particularly acquainted with Jane Austin's book (or last read it in high school many years ago) the movie provides a pleasant love story, even if it is seriously lacking in the subtlety of the original.  Knightley as Lizzie is a delight to look at and Macfayden may be the best Darcy on film--at least as far as the script allowed.But, at best, it is the ""highlights"" of Pride and Prejudice and is no substitute for the book, or at minimum, one of the mini-series.  As I indicated above the Elizabeth Garvie version of 1990 is, in my view, the best.  Elizabeth Garvie is incredible, she simply ""is"" Elizabeth Bennet.  This version also adheres closest to the text of the book, and is now available on an inexpensive DVD--which, incidentally, is more complete than the earlier VHS version.  (However, the Lawrence Olivier movie of the 1940s is, in my mind, a complete travesty to be avoided like the plague.)"	3.0	"""Highlights"" of Pride and Prejudice"	2006-03-05	20	13	7

Brown ""Admitted Addicted to Love Stories"""	I am a fan of Jane Austen and while this film does it's best to stick to the reality of the book it does omit characters and takes the liberty of adding scenes or altering them completely.  This does not bother me as I know that seldom do movies follow an author's intention.  Having said that, this movie is a pure delight!

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AN4DJJLQVXFO0	PearlTech	"Having finished reading Amazon's complimentary e-copy of Pride and Prejudice on my Kindle, I was ready to watch the movie adaptation of this delightful story. I knew that the BBC 1995 version was the golden standard having watched snippets of both the 1995 and 2005 versions on Youtube. One night, while surfing through the tv channels, I caught the second half of this 2005 adaptation. I've enjoyed it very much and decided to purchase the dvd + digital product.This was not a 100% faithful adaptation of the book. It took poetic license in capturing Jane Austen's witty observations. The fireworks between Mr. Darcy and Lizzy Bennet were there. Kiera Knightley's portrayal to some might represent the same old ""I am tough"" mentality but it brought to live Lizzie's wittiness and intelligence when she stood up to Darcy and his aunt, Lady Catherine. One could felt the loving bonds between Lizzie and her father (Donald Sutherland) towards the end of the  movie when she declared her love for Mr. Darcy. Of course, the American ending was a bit ""saccharine"" as observed by the actor Matthew Macfadyen  (Mr.Darcy) in his interviews.The cinematography was simply beautiful. It was noted in the DVD commentary that one of scenes was filmed next to a 500 years old tree.I was able to download the digital copy from Itunes using the provided complimentary code and watch the digital copy.This movie has 2.8 million likes on Facebook. Those statistics speak for the popularity of the movie."	5.0	Beautiful cinematography and entertaining !	2012-04-18	3	2	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AA0BGTQHWKSQY	Peekablue	Keira Knightly's interpretation of Elizabeth Bennet was ridiculous.  She made Lizzy out to be sort of a snot.  Elizabeth would never have disrespected her mother the way Knightly's version did in this movie.  It was not true to the book, to the character, or to the period.  Perhaps it was bad directing & not completely the actress's fault but that totally ruined the movie, for me.	1.0	A horrible portrayal of Elizabeth	2008-07-26	27	17	10
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1RO53YG6XST7I	"Peety R. Arblaster ""Eclectic Collector"""	"This is a great adaptation.  The acting is great and is the directing.  This story is the classic "" Pride and Prejudice"" story as told by Jane Austen once you've cut out all the exasperating and inconsequential details.  This movie gets right to the point without diminishing the theme or plot of the story.It is the classic tale of Elizabeth.  Elizabeth is smart, but loyal to her sisters.  Jane, Elizabeth's older sister, falls in love with Mr. Bingley.  Mr. Darcy is Mr. Bingley's best friend and insults Elizabeth, but is unaware that she can hear him.  Elizabeth is enchanted by Mr. Wickham.  Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy and through a series of misunderstandings on both their parts they end up misjudging both each and others.  Elizabeth finds out that Mr. Darcy encouraged Mr. Bingley not marry Jane because he believed that Jane didn't love Mr. Bingley.  Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth that he loves despite himself.  Elizabeth clears up the misunderstanding that Mr. Darcy had about Jane and she also tells him off.  Mr. Darcy writes a letter and explains the truth about Mr. Wickham and what a leech he is.  Elizabeth's feelings towards Mr. Darcy start to change.  Then Elzabeth's youngest and most foolish sister, Lydia runs off with Mr. Wickham.  Mr. Darcy uses his vast fortune to make certain that Mr. Wickham marries Lydia.  He also gets Mr. Bingley and Jane back together.  Elizabeth finds out about both of these things.  Both she and Mr. Darcy start telling each the truth about how they really feel about one another.  It is not hard to deduce what happens next.All in all this is a great romantic film.  Jane Austen, tends to beat around the bush too much.  This film takes out all unneccessary running around and it gets right to the point without changing the plot.  However if films where the primary focus is romance are not your thing I would advise against you watching this film.  If a person loves a good romance then I would highly recommend this film."	5.0	It Gets to the Point	2013-04-28	1	0	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A33M6QPC4YD0LC	Pepe Le Pew	"After reading so many one-star reviews that called this film rubbish, I was curious to watch it and try to find out if this is really such an awful movie. Well, it is.  In fact, ""awful"" is too mild a word. ""Abominable"" is more like it.Everything in this film is appalling. All the characters were badly cast. Mr. Bingley was a teenaged idiot. Mr. Bennett seemed to be on drugs most of the time or just senile. Mrs. Bennett looked and behaved like a fishmonger's wife, no manners whatsoever. Mr. Collins was humorless (capital offense!). Lady de Bourg looked like Marie Antoinette who had somehow escaped the guillotine and talked just like M. Keira Knightly spent 50% of her screen time trying to be cute, and the other 50% to be sexy by keeping her mouth half open in a clearly orgasmic expression (she was supposed to be Ms. Elisabeth Bennett, my goodness, who was anything but a sex-kitten!). But the worst of all was Mr. Darcy:  he couldn't act for the life of him, and he looked like a cross between a hound and Peter Lorre! In fact, all the moments of comic relief in this movie came from this non-entity of an actor. I laughed out loud when I saw him walking across the field in his open shirt, looking like Keanu Reeves in Constantine or in The Matrix, and I laughed again when he spat out from ONE corner of his mouth the line ""You have bewitched me body and soul.""  Yuck!I know somebody might argue that it is unfair to compare this film with the 6-hour A&E; version, but then, with all the money that was available to them, they should have tried to match, if not surpass, some of the pivotal scenes. Try comparing the wonderful Netherfield ball scene in the A&E; version, so charged with sexual tension, with an almost insolent yet refined Jennifer Ehle sparring with the love-sick Firth  and weaving in and out of the other dancers, with the same, but anemic one in this film, and you'll know what I mean. Worst yet: the liberties that both the director and the screenwriter took to ""improve""on the original story were just preposterous and bizarre to say the least. For example, the very first scene showed Lizzie reading a book upside down WHILE walking (it was fortunate she did not walk into a pond or a tree); the first proposal became a shouting match with Lizzie working her mouth like a pump; Lizzie starting a conversation during church service and licking her fingers at table; Lady de Bourg visiting at night; Mr. Darcy entering Lizzie's room to deliver his letter, etc. And what was that scene with the pig with inflamed organs? And the room with nude sculptures? Clearly, they were trying to sex up the story. I wouldn't be surprised if their next project should be a porn version of Snow White. Oh, I forgot, someone did that already.The whole film has the feel of a two-hour commercial for Nissan cars or Prada products, with the camera focusing almost obsessively on  Keira Knightly's face and CGI effects added to ""enhance"" the scenery (the flying geese in the pond scene are clearly one of such doubtful achievements).A waste of time. Not the worst movie I have ever seen, but a pretty good runner-up. As to money, I congratulate myself for having to pay only 9 bucks for a previously-viewed copy from Blockbuster. Even that was too much for such a lousy film. The screenwriter should be banned from making another ""adaptation"" of any classic of literature for life and the director from making any new movie for ten years, until he acquires the good sense that only age can provide."	1.0	Abominable, appalling	2006-05-30	112	81	31

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2QEA1RKT5N09I	"Peter G. Keen ""rabidreader"""	P&P; is one of the jewels of English literature. It's very robust in that it is so open to different slants on it. This movie is a new slant and adds beautifully to the Ehle/Firth BBC interpretation. It's the more moving. Jennifer Ehle was my own perfect embodiment of Lizzie but Keira Knightley adds a dimension of extraordinary unfolding of the internal turmoil of Lizzie and her kindness -- the scenes with Jane are so subtle in their deep love for each other. Matthew Mcfadyen is a completely different Darcy from Colin Firth's but far more resonant. It is interesting to see Judi Dench in the film as the dreadful Lady Catherine. I am an old Brit who saw her in many performances on stage -- I think Keira K signals in this film that she is in the same league and on the same growth path.Critics of the film point out that it plays around somewhat with the tone and storyline of the novel. True, but it also enhances one's perspective on this great work. The movie is too kind to Mrs. Bennet but does articulate the truly desperate issue of marriage as the only career chance for young women. Donald Sutherland is a little underplayed especially in not showing his contempt for his wife but brings out so well his love for Lizzie. This is also the best portrayal of Jane I know of.And so on. Yes, this is not the literal adaptation of P&P; but it really is a superb accompaniment to and enhancement of it. Jsne Austen was in no way a romantic but a shrewd and cool observer. She is Mozartian in that the cool and controlled surface is moving in that the depth of feeling their work hides but dignifies is so intense. Only in her last and apparently semi-autbiographical novel, Persuasion, does one get a sense of the depth of her regrets and the pathos of her short life. I think that the main contribution of the Keira/Matthew combination is to bring P&P; closer to Persuasion and unpeel Austen's deep insights into and regrets about love in an age where feelings were so rarely expressed.This is a lovely and loving film. It is almost Chekovian in its style. I hope Knightley doesn't get nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal. It's far too good for that. I also hope she will pick scripts that help her grow beyond the Oscar-ready stuff.	5.0	Austen, Mozart, Shakespeare -- all unique	2007-01-03	7	6	1

(We both HATE to dance, among other things) I was, shall we say, reluctant to believe her, but curiosity got the better of me. After all, I had to see what she was talking about.Now keep in mind that I was supposed to read this book in high school and as a seventeen year old male, I refused on sheer principle. What did I care about some romance book about a bunch of girls who want to marry rich. Who cared?All that said, this movie is a GREAT adaptation of the book (which I have since read, again out of curiosity) It makes the characters both modern and classic without diminishing either quality. The supporting cast is understated, but outstanding. Both Sutherland and Dench deliver superlatively without taking the limelight from Knightly or Macfadyn, to whom the film truly belongs.Even if the thought of having anything to do with Jane Austin makes your skin crawl (as it did with me), give this a try.

The BBC version was probably the best version of Pride and Prejudice. It remains true to the characters and to the tone of the book. It would remain the flagship and reference point for all other P&P; based movies.  I am certain that Jane Austin would have loved it. *****2. I also saw Bride and Prejudice (An adaptation). Although, it was far removed from the BBC Classic, It actually remained true to Jane Austin for the most part. A Comedy. A romantic comedy and very delightful. The Jane Austen Society was so enthused and ecstatic after sitting through a screening, they offered Chadha a lifetime membership. . On my first watch, I was expecting a serious classic and hence was disappointed. But on subsequent viewing, I thoroughly enjoyed the light humorous take on P&P.I; would wager that Jane would approve of Bride and Prejudice. ****3. This version? Well.. It is a romantic movie...but it is not a romantic comedy. It was way too serious more like Bront. Many of the characters were downright loathsome (Lizy's mom and Collins).

They got it all wrong on so many accounts that I am trying to figure out where to begin. I really didn't care for this portrayal of the characters, they made the mother look like a sweet little lamb just trying to get her daughters married, Mr.Bingley like a bumbling idiot,and the three youngest girls act like children! Keira Knightley is beautiful, but a woman with that kind of flat chest would have been considerd deathly skinny, and not a man would have wanted her because she has no figure. They also portrayed the Bennets as being poor. Which is incorrect because the man didn't expect to have five daughters and therefore didn't make provision for there dowries.They were actually supposed to be upper middle class people. Lydia Bennet bothers me as does the relationship between Lizzie and Her father. They are supposed to be close, but through out the whole movie there relationship seems strained until towards the end where her father says that he will miss her.Boom! Right out of no where. And Lidia Bennet is supposed to be tall and good looking for her age, that's why she can attract the officers like flies. She flirts and looks cute. But no! The actress that plays her looks like she is a tall twelve year old. And speaking of looks, were they trying to go ugly when they cast Darcey? I thought he was supposed to be rich AND handsome. And if the guy that played Mr.Wickham would have wanted me to run away with him, I would have cried from insault! But, on a lighter note, they did cast Mr.Collins well. He is about as creepy as a little man can get. And this movie has some great cinematography. But the cons definantly weigh out the pros. I almost winced whenever Lizzie or Darcey spoke their lines, their delivery was awful. If you want to see THE BEST adaptation of a truely great story, stick to the unmolested version.

The rest of the dialog is anachronistic and stupid, with too many panderings to 21st century conceptions of romance.  The pauperization of the Bennett parents was completely unnecessary to point out the particular situation of their daughters. A few comments about the entail would have been sufficient.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3CKWKLURZWPRP	policeman's wife	Pride & Prejudice is one of my favorite books, I've read it at least a dozen times.  This film version is very faithful to the main storyline and the important side stories as well.  Brenda Blethin (sp?) does a fantastic job as silly, vapid Mrs. Bennett and Donald Sutherland is spot-on as snarky Mr. Bennett. Keira Knightley is not a favorite actress of mine but she does a fine job as heroine Elizabeth Bennett.  Matthew McFadyen is a smoldering, tense, and prideful Darcy.  When he finally relaxes and smiles, your heart melts!  Simon Woods and Rosamund Pike do a beautiful job portraying sweet and affable Mr. Bingley and Jane, respectively.  Caroline Bingley is snotty, proud, and gorgeous.  Dame Judi Dench as Lady Catherine is superb.  She is derisive and arrogant in full measure.  When she confronts Elizabeth...watch out!I ordered the digital copy of this as well as the dvd copy.  The scenery, settings, and music are just lovely.  You will want to watch this film again and again.  And then probably once more.  =)	5.0	wonderful movie adaptation	2013-01-29	0	0	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AVYKIZP2CL3FG	Polly Anna	I made the mistake of paying two bucks to rent this. I don't know how anyone could give it more than 1 star, or how Knightly got an Oscar nomination. This was miserably miscast, misdirected, and poorly acted.The script follows the novel only loosely, omitting so much of the story that I doubt someone unfamiliar with P & P would even know what is going on. Instead of showing the Bennets as gentlepeople, this version has them living in a farmyard with a pig wandering into the house. The historical detail is a mess, too. This film has Darcy proposing to Elizabeth at dawn in a field with both of them in their pajamas.A real travesty of one of the finest novels in the English language.	1.0	Ghastly. Awful.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AVYOWVJHYX2DN	Ponette	Like most of the reviewers below, I liked this version a lot -- again, not as good as the BBC version, but it came mighty close.  I particularly liked the dance scenes, which I felt had so much life and passion to them that was missing in the BBC version -- the BBC scenes were much more genteel.  The main actors were wonderful (particularly Keira Knightley).  The close ups of Dame Judi Dench were a little hard to take on the big screen, and I felt she played it over the top. My only other complaint was the last scene (I won't give it away) -- but it was way too modern for my taste and didn't seem to fit the period.  But all in all, a wonderful movie, I do recommend it highly.	5.0	Wonderful Version -- Comes Close to 1995	2006-02-17	9	6	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3RMG28RCD60MO	Pride and Prejudice Rules (The book and 2005 ...	This movie is the best movie I have ever seen. The actors are great, specially for Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfellen. I think that the movie gave a totally new look at the story. Whenever I watch old or set in older times movies I always think, ah! That looks so fake! Oh, its boring! But with this movie, after a while, you get observed in it, and practically believe that it IS the 1800s. Everything has such a great, fresh look to it, unlike the 1995 BBC version, where its all chocolate boxes instead of real life settings. The portrayal of Mr. Darcy is perfect as Matthew Macfellen! He totally shows what my idea of Mr. Darcy was! Colin Firth (no offence), to me, seems more like not gay, but different from what Mr. Darcy really is.I always thought Mr. Darcy as a manly man, like Mcfellen. I LOVE the way he looks at Elizabeth and how he can show everything he is feeling with his eyes. I'm really happy that they decided to keep the characters to their Austen ages because I hate it when I watch movies and they show people like really old or really young. I think that Knightley did an awesome job as elizabeth, just like i imagened her. The 1995 BBC series Elizabeth totally doesn't fit my image of her.I love how the movie ended because I really liked the book but when I read it, I thought that the only thing it lacked was, exactly, a kiss. At least its better than Colin's 1800s wet t-shirt contest contestant scene!!Overall I LOVE this movie and this adaptation. Its greatly acted, great scenery, great costumes, and great portrayal of characters. Also it does a great job of adapting the book because the script really sticks to the book. A lot of people don't like the movie because its 2 hours long and they claim that it should be longer and that it cuts a lot off, but I think its great! You can watch it with your family, friends, etc. etc. If you really want to know everything, you should read the book instead of watching a chocolate box, wet t-shirt contest adaptation because you shouldn't be lazy and sit with a bowl of popcorn getting fat for 5 hours because you don't want to read the book! Read it! Also, the 2005 p&p; is MUCH better than the sucky 1995.Go watch and buy the Dvd for pride and prejudice!:)	5.0	Excellent Movie!!	2006-02-15	17	11	6

Her shock at Mr. Collins's proposal is palpable.But the real revelation is Darcy.  Instead of the prig he usually seems, here he seems a smoldering, volcanic presence more like Mr. Rochester.Also the setting is smashing--Romantic lush outdoor scenes, very untypical of Austen.Also the earthiness is sublime.  Pigs cavort in the Bennets' house--reminding us WHY Mrs. B. is trying to marry her daughters off: the rigid class system that prevents them from owning land, and prevents them from working.	5.0	Un-Austen, and Wonderful	2009-05-06	4	2	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ACMM9OS9QTO4X	Pure Nerd	I can hardly believe Amazon's review and customers review of this movie. While the casting of characters like Elizabeth and Mrs.Bennett was exquisite, it is contrasted poorly by pitiful casting, for example, Pike as Jane.The thing with novel adaptations is that character's image will be different from one reader to the next so no movie will ever satisfy, in the regard, every audience member. But the characteristic is unquestionable and so is the mood of each scene. The director poorly captured certain mood and disposition of minor characters such as Mr.Bennett and Jane.I give up.

Although Eliza is spirited, I feel that in this movie her character went from spirited to blatantly rude.The Bennett's lived like paupers in this movie, which was not so.  They were not rich, but they were not poor either.  The girls seemed unkept in this movie.And as many others have pointed out, many of the historical societal behaviors were disregarded.And why was Bingley portrayed to be intellectually incompetent? Nowhere in the book is it suggested and completely ruined the movie for me.I also believe that after seeing the Firth and Ehle version, that followed the novel so meticulously, I may be biased.	2.0	Nonsense	2012-04-12	4	3	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AQR22MPF45M3P	Rachel Ford	"Where is the Austen in this Austen ""adaptation""? Little from the original, beyond the names of the characters, remains in this sorry attempt; characters are altered, society is turned on its head, and custom is thrown to the wind - in short, everything that made Pride and Prejudice the masterpiece that it is is discarded in favor of dramatic flare and overblown romantic nonsense. Which is all too bad - Knightley is a capable actress, and, with a script that was worthy of the name, would likely have made a very interesting Elizabeth Bennett. Alas, but this version is to Austen's novel (and previous film interpretations) what a preschooler's scribble is to the Mona Lisa.One of the beauties of Jane Austen's works was her depiction of social reality - the austere social boundaries, the condescension with which those who crossed them were met, the petty grievances and wiles of social climbers, etc., etc. The decision makers behind this film, however, apparently found that all far too tedious, and, in their wisdom, opted instead to introduce a host of classic elements of refined society, such as pigs in the house and a family full of eavesdroppers congregated about every door. While her family was mingling with the swine and fixing their ears to the nearest entryway, this Lizzy, unlike the intelligent but flawed Elizabeth of the book, preferred to simper and smirk more than anything else. Poor Mr. Darcy, however, fares no better, and wanders about aimlessly in this film, seeming at times as if he suffers more from bowel discomfort than symptoms of the heart. The rest of the characters fall into this pattern, seeming little more than absurd caricatures or parodies of the original.The scenarios are no less appalling than the characters. Gone are the societal strictures that governed life, and, in their favor, the annoying banalities of the ludicrously dramatized romance novel. The tedium of proposing in a parlor is traded for the excitement of proposing in the rain; the monotony of social calls made according to the custom of the day abandoned in favor of dramatic confrontations. In short, the authors of this script attempted to apply the formula of the trite, forgettable modern romance novel, with all of its absurd scenarios and fanciful gestures, to a masterpiece of historical social commentary, and a love story worthy of the name. In doing so, they failed to make either a compelling Austen adaptation, or even a tolerable romance.1/5 stars...try to understand the source if you're going to make a film about it..."	1.0	A cheap, overly dramatized romance masquerading as Austen	2011-02-16	13	5	8

Yet this film portrayed them as more working class with their cheap looking gowns and ugly home.However, on another matter i thought Mr Darcy was fabulous in appearance yet when he opened his mouth he spoke far too fast for the Darcy we all know.A very disappointing film yet funny in places.I did buy it and it is good to watch if you have a few hours spare but much better to rent from the video store than actually buying it.	1.0	Very disappointing	2006-06-19	21	12	9

Having said that, I'm not one to get into the realism of each scene and whether or not it was historicaly accurate.  I loved the movie.  Until the end.  I loved the cast and thought they did a brilliant job.  Until the end.  Was I the only person who was left in the theater going ""That was the end?  Are they kidding?""  There was no kiss, no joyous words of love exchanged, nothing. You wait the whole film to see the end and they just cut it off, like they ran out of money or time and had to end it right there.  I'm all for leaving things to the imagination, but that was just mean.  How could they not kiss?!  There's no culmination of the love that has been built between them.  I left this movie feeling like something great had been built up and then just ripped away. Am I the only one who felt this way?  I can't imagine I am, but  I was disappointed when I left.

I could not wait until Keira Knightley's version came to America. However, I do agree that it was shorter and left you wanting.  It was over too quickly and you felt sort of cheated.  I must say I thought the actor that played Mr. Wickam was much better looking than the Mr. Wickam of the mini series.Also, Judi Dench's Lady Catherine lacked character and was not a very good role for her so I was very disappointed. I'm a fan of Judi Dench's. And I really missed Colin Firth. Oh no one plays Mr. Darcy like Colin!  NO ONE.  So, Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth as far as I'm concerned still rein as the only true Lizzie and Mr. Darcy.I might add my sister is a great fan of the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice. She also was just getting over a treatment of chemotherapy for breast cancer and my niece and I decided to have a Pride and Prejudice Birthday party for her.  It was wonderful.  We all dressed in long skirts or dresses, white gloves, hats and we each brought a beautiful tea cup and saucer to the party.  At the end we drew numbers and whatever number was on the bottom of the saucer that matched ours we got to take home.  My sister was overwhelmed and very happy that we did that for her.  We also blew up a photograph of Colin Firth (whom she loves) signed it and framed it for her.  We put that beside her place of honor at the table which was ladened with scones and tea cakes, muffins and teas.  It was great and we plan to do it again this year!

Colin, Jennifer Ehle, and A&E; articulate all the nuance possible for Jane Austen's text.  Matthew, Kiera Knightly, and director, Joe Wright cut through the fat and get to the meat, which is a good thing.  I have seen both versions (mini series and movie) and like them both.  It's a good thing that there are so many versions of this story available; this is a testament to the value of the basic story.Some may have problems with Joe Wright's 2005 movie version, but it is refreshing to see this interpretation/adaptation of the story.  The Bennets are brilliant cast as very rural gentry, which is what they were.  Moreover, Darcy and Bingley are not overly fastidious, as urbane gentlemen.  Judy Dench, of course, nails aristocratic Lady Catherine.  These are three levels of English society.  Social caste was critical during that time, so it is important that Wright emphasize levels such as aristocracy, urbane gentility, and rural landed gentry.  It is very credible in either version that these city boys (Darcy and Bingley) would prefer country girls rather than too polished city girls, as sometimes the artifice must stop.If pigs in the country offend, or museum-quality mansions on the other side of the country seem cold and unlivable, then stick with the A&E; version, which sticks very close to Jane Austen's book.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2L6QS8SVHT9RG	"randomartco ""period film aficionado"""	"First off, the casting: Keira Knightley was a good choice for Elizabeth Bennet. She would not have been my first choice after the lovely job by Jennifer Ehle in A&E;/BBC's 1995 version, but Keira played the part very well and I believed in her Elizabeth from start to finish! Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy: all I can say is WOW! MacFadyen is a relative unknown (I know him only as the gambling loser Felix Carbury in Trollope's ""The Way We Live Now""): his portrayal was passionate, gritty, determined, loveable, heartfelt and moving: I was completely convinced and fell in love (as other Colin Firth fans will likely do so shortly). Added to these two top-notch choices is some other great talent: Rosamund Pike (Lady Harriet Cumnor in ""Wives & Daughters"") as Jane Bennet, Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet, Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet, Tom Hollander (Osborne Hamley in ""Wives & Daughters"") as Mr. Collins, and Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourg: the only somewhat puzzling choices were Rupert Friend as Mr. Wickham and Simon Woods as Mr. Bingley...they seemed to make Mr. Bingley's character incredibly nave and almost silly in this film (which I must admit, did add some nice comic relief), whereas the 1995 P&P; chooses to make him only too apt to believe the best in everyone too easily influenced by others. Mr Wickham was only slightly likeable to me, and was not given enough screen time for us to truly believe why Elizabeth defended him so much to Darcy. The cast was rounded out with Jena Malone as Lydia Bennet, Talulah Riley as Mary Bennet, and Carey Mulligan as Kitty Bennet, as well as a few others.The overall storyline and feel: I thought they did an excellent job condensing the storyline into a theatrical movie-length version. I was mighty impressed with the screenwriter, and was not surprised to find out that Emma Thompson (who wrote the screenplay for 1995's ""Sense & Sensibility"", as well as giving an Oscar-winning performance as Elinor Dashwood) did an un-credited and unpaid rewrite of the new ""Pride & Prejudice"" script: she is given a special thanks in the end credits. The cinematography of the film was well done, with gorgeous scenes and imagery created: the soundtrack score is excellent, soft and unassuming, but seems to blend perfectly with the film: highly recommended. There is little that I would like to change overall: a few content issues (as described below), and otherwise, my changes would be: 1) the final scene: it is a bit too modern-feeling, and not true to Jane Austen as it should be 2) one scene where Lizzie reads a letter: she is upset & crying, only I thought it felt a bit stilted and not quite credible 3) Lady Catherine's speech to Elizabeth: I felt it could have been stronger, and have more ""umph"" behind it. Set design and costumes: the costumes work perfectly with the mood and feel of the film: at first I was a bit disappointed that they put Elizabeth in so much brown, but it works very well with the grit and feel of the film (and makes it seem much more real), and there are times (like at the Netherfield Ball), when you get some gorgeous white & light-colored costumes on the characters (including a beautiful snow-white dress on Elizabeth, with a lovely upswept hairdo). I thought the set design was very well done, and loved the very realistic feel of the film: the comparison between the Bennet house and Pemberly is quite drastic and added to the credibility of Darcy's wealth.For those of you interested in ""family-friendly"" remarks, read this paragraph, otherwise you can skip to the next one. Content: There is one scene with a character walking through a room full of white, marble statues, mostly nude, and admiring them: mostly the shots show behinds, though some naked breasts are shown as well in a ceiling painting. There is one use of a*s, and little else in the way of language. There is some dialogue that alludes to the fact that an unmarried man & woman ran off together, not necessarily with any plans to get married, but it is eventually resolved; there is some cleavage shown, but nothing too drastic. All in all, the content is kept to a minimum.This beautifully-filmed and well-acted movie is well worth the time & effort of going to the movie theatre, in a day and age when there is often little that does such. The romance they created in a few scenes was, I felt, beyond compare. For those of you who loved & enjoyed A&E; and BBC's 1995 version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you are in for a treat: there are enough differences in the movies to make them both loveable, but enough similarities in dialogue that you don't feel you are missing anything. This new film & soundtrack is highly recommended (I bought the soundtrack from Amazon UK a month ago, as it is being released Nov 15th in the USA): this movie will also end up being a must-add to any woman's DVD collection!!"	5.0	Gorgeously-filmed & delightfully-enchanting new film adaptation!	2006-03-07	17	13	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2HJB9J5O5CLPB	R. A Rubin	I've read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Emma, and Sense and Sensibility.  She rivals Shakespeare as the greatest artist of English literature.  Both writers were concerned with basic human motivation, but Austen limited her observation to what she knew best, the courtship of 18th Century men and women of all classes.  She particularly enjoyed matching rather struggling middle class girls with the Bill Gates of their day, the local nobility.Keira Knightley makes a lovely Elizabeth Bennet.  She's has every virtue and flaw that her love match, Mr. Darcy possesses, and there is the problem.  They are so alike, they are blind to each other's virtues initially, obsessing upon their human foibles instead, mostly their unmitigated pride.  But what smitten couple of any century is any different.  Ah, Austen is universally appreciated since she spotlights what most Earthly inhabitants will encounter one or more times in a lifetime, love.I think I may prefer the Laurence Olivier version made in the 1930's.  After all, his Darcy is superb, never to be duplicated, but this newer version uses modern color cinematography to advantage.  Jane Austen is always worthwhile.  This is an excellent rendition.	4.0	Excellent Rendition	2006-05-05	19	12	7

The acting is superb and very believable; it gives more depth to the characters. Jane Austen, herself, critiqued ""Pride and Prejudice"" after it was published, by saying it lacked shadows or depth. Director Joe Wright did a fantastic job at creating those moments between Elizabeth and Darcy, so the movie takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride that is very believable. Brenda Blythe and Donald Sutherland do outstanding jobs in their roles as Elizabeth's parents. One last thing: the music is out of this world.

Then imagine this woman walking with vibrant piano playing in the background and her dress flowing in the breeze. Put her in an idyllic country setting and then set up an impossible romance. Then surround her with four lively sisters who love to dance and live for the faintest moment of romance. There are so many scenes in which these women amusingly listen at doors or giggle while discussing men. It is simply made even more intoxicating when these women engage men in witty banter. Truly, Elizabeth is a radiant delight. There is one scene where she expresses her utter disdain for Mr. Darcy and they almost kiss. The tension is unbearable but I completely adored every minute of it. To top it all off, this movie is so superbly filmed it makes other movies pale in comparison. The timing in every scene is impeccable and the precision is an absolute wonder to behold. This is now my all-time favorite movie. It is just indescribably beautiful.

A simple story based on the timeless theme that you truly come to know yourself through the eyes of the one you were destined for. Lizzie has her eyes on everyone around her, noting their flaws, and has a very small circle of people she believes in. Through Darcy she is able to see that she doesn't know everything, that she has faults and makes mistakes, but that she is still a person of integrity and worthy of love.	5.0	I Love, I Love, I Love You	2007-06-04	1	1	0

When I was in high school, I read Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". It was honestly one of the few books I've read in my entire life (and I've read many books in my life) that literally had my heart beat and race at a fast rate. I couldn't put the book down. Jane Austen was one of the best writers of all time. You truly feel, sense, and live through her writing when you flip each page of her books. Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfayden do an excellent job in this film. The whole cast is great, but it is Keira and Matthew's acting that make this film so beautiful and emotional. If I had a fantasy romance, I would want it to be like this film's version of ""Pride and Prejudice"".

The casting was very good. Keira Knightley was an excellent Elizabeth Bennet and she carried the film. I daresay she's one of the most talented young actors of our time. Matthew Macfadyn's performance as Mr. Darcy was a little wooden compared to Keira Knightley's lively Lizzy. But I believe Mr. Darcy himself is a bit wooden so the portrayal is accurate. The lines were delivered wonderfully and I can't help but quote them from time to time. The score is beautiful as well and puts me in a very relaxing mood. I highly recommend buying the soundtrack.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1KJZ24K2Y8IH2	Renoir	I hadn't read the book or seen the BBC version when I first saw this film, so I could only compare it to the old Garson/Olivier version. I think it is an improvement to have younger actors playing Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy (even though I'm a major Greer Garson fan). I definitely felt the chemistry! It might help that Kiera Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen are so lovely to look at.I'm thoroughly impressed with the director of this latest version. I was moved by the small gestures, glances, and lingering looks that said so much. Also quite taken with Matthew MacFadyen's grace and elegance contrasted with his awkwardness at times. He did an outstanding job portraying a sense of superiority as well as depicting his confusion and love for Elizabeth without words, though his deep sonorous voice has bewitched me....I agree, it was a more contemporary take on the time period, with informalities we would never have seen in those days--but easily overlooked. Beautiful cinematography, charming costuming, and pleasing soundtrack. The only thing that gave me trouble was the incredible quick pace. The diaglogue was often delivered too rapidly. This did not, however, diminish my appreciation for this beautifully directed, superbly-acted, utterly romantic film.	5.0	Three Cheers for the Director!	2006-08-25	9	7	2

The music lets you know right from the beginning that this is a love story/epic, and uses period-style melodies that draw you into the narrative. The attention to period detail hasn't been so impressive since Polanski's ""Tess"". And the acting couldn't be more pitch-perfect. Indeed, Keira Knightly was the headstrong yet vulnerable Lizzie, and Matt MacFadyen managed to get better looking as the film went on, to the point that it was almost a distraction. We are seeing Darcy through Lizzie's eyes. Wonderful supporting performances from Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland, and a particularly bitchy Dame Judi Dench, as well as everyone else, certainly add to this most pleasurable film experience. I'm hoping the Academy won't write this off as just another adaptation of a classic. This film can stand on its own as entertainment right alongside any of 'em.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2PC729BOEA502	R. Geiler	The main character in this movie is a person of few words and blunt statements, which is the opposite of what the main character of the novel is.  She should love language, revel in banter -- everything the film version does not offer.  Without this love of spoken language, the character is unbelievable when she actually speaks the lines of the novel's character in important scenes.  Suddenly, her speach becomes elevated and exacting, whereas she normally just grunts responses.  In fact, this is about the worst script version of the story have seen.  It seems that the makers of the movie didn't believe that a modern audience could appreciate a literate character, so they dumbed her down.	2.0	This Production Dumbs the Main Character Down	2008-08-15	15	10	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AXOS8IWBXNZGT	"Richard W Little ""I am a maple leaf on the wi..."	"I quote Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Last month my fiancee and I went to see the film, starring Keira Knightley and company.Any period piece film adaptation draws an inevitable comparison against its novel roots. I have to say that, for the most part, the film does well with its translation. I had been concerned with the casting of KK in the lead heroine role here, but she does a good job with the material, and the emotional range she conveys with her facial expressions rather caught my attention. The rest of the main cast are solid choices as well, and it is nice to see a fellow Canadian, Donald Sutherland, continuing to find work at his age! I was left wondering if Dame Judi's character was supposed to be so one-dimensional, as it has been a long time since I've read the book, but it's only a little nit, nothing more. Matthew MacFadyen, does an excellent job with Darcy, leading us to see a complex character from a distance, literally, as the characters' pride keeps the two main characters apart so often.My main complaint is with the ending. If the movie had ended with the novel's ending, it would have been perfect. The ""Hollywood ending"", with ""the big kiss"", sticks a dagger into the spirit of the times, and of the writing--romantic love was supposed to be implied, not shown. Not sure what the movie makers were thinking--did they think this would be a big box office draw? Ah well.I do recommend the movie though. It's well acted, and well produced, and shot in spectacular scenery. It's, uh, safe for kids, but they'd better be able to keep up with ""fancy talking""!"	4.0	"""For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"""	2005-12-12	5	3	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3171JJW1KM592	Rick	I must first confess that I am the typical man. True to my kind, my favorite movies heretofore tended to be triumphant accounts of victory such as &#8220;Miracle&#8221;, &#8220;Invictus&#8221;, &#8220;Secretariat&#8221; and of course &#8220;Gladiator&#8221;, coldly avoiding romantic movies as a waste of time!I only watched this film because Mrs. Douglas, my high school English teacher, required my class to read the book.  However, either I didn&#8217;t read it well or as a result of my failing memory I couldn&#8217;t recall what it was about.  I did, however, recognize the title as I clicked through the cable guide.  So, on a whim, I began watching it and shortly after the beginning I found myself captivated, frantically hitting the record button!I adore this 2005 interpretation of Jane Austen&#8217;s novel.  Keira Knightly is divine and Mathew MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy compliments her charming yet feisty portrayal of Miss Lizzie Bennet perfectly.Though previous renditions of Jane&#8217;s novel may be more faithful to the story line, the 2005 film boldly strays, offering a story deliciously saturated with laughter, riotous gaiety, humor and, of course, seething emotion.  I feel Jane herself would not have objected.  This version skillfully contrasts the grandeur and spectacle of Georgian England society through its display of the fictional estates of Netherfield, Rosings Park, and Pemberly to the earthy likes of Longbourn.  I know many criticize how Longbourn was represented in the  movie, but I felt it deepened the theme of the story.  So get over it!As for my avoidance of romantic stories, I&#8217;ve been so blind.  This movie has bewitched me, body and soul.  It&#8217;s an entrancing film, most completely and perfectly and incandescently wonderful.  As for the number of times I&#8217;ve watched it, guilt ridden, I can hardly be expected to own to it.It rises to the very top of my list!	5.0	You got to watch this!	2013-03-21	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2FUB7MZT7APPC	R.L.	"The acting is decent, though the leads are not at all in the league of Ehle and Firth, from the BBC miniseries. The real problem, however, is that it is an adaptation that tries to shoehorn Pride and Prejudice into a two-hour film. The ""set up"" for  many situations is weakened or virtually eliminated, so many scenes lack the punch they should have. I think somone coming to Pride and Prejudice for the first time would be bewildered as to what the 200+ years of fuss have been about. Another serious problem is that this drastic condensing eliminates a lot of the comedy in Austen's novel (that the BBC miniseries preserved) -- the character of Mr. Collins is one example, as is the visit of Lydia and Wickham after their marriage. And the close relationship between Elizabeth and her father just doesn't exist in this one. I'm afraid the BBC miniseries still rules, hands down!"	3.0	Two hours can't do it justice	2006-04-01	20	15	5

Sun ""RoLeeSun"""	While this adaptation was not entirely disagreeable, I cannot understand why anyone would alter the best thing about Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice...the language, the dialogue.  I enjoyed the slightly grittier portrayal of a country gentleman's lifestyle, but the wholesale trashing of the beautiful language and dialogue used by Jane Austen is a tragedy.  Often times it seems like the screenwriter could not come up with words for the character.  Word of advice...use Jane Austen's original words.  They are perfect.  It seems like scenes were cut short in order to show Lizzy spinning on a swing, looking at a sunset, etc... Though these scenes were pretty, they did not justify cutting out classic scenes.  It seems like the director wanted to do a stylish film, and it succeeds to a degree on this level.  But, this adaptation falls flat on so many levels.  The definitive adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is still the A&E version with Colin Firth.	3.0	Don't mess with Jane Austen's use of Language and Dialogue!!!	2014-01-04	1	0	1

I hadn't read the book in over 20 years and so pulled it off the shelf to reread it.  They certainly used many quotes from the book, however it was rarely the correct character who spoke them.  Still, it was a lovely movie.  They made Mr. Darcy seem more awkward and nervous than haughty.  He was definitely not as sweet in the book.  He was a snob.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	In the past week I have seen a movie that I thought I was going to love but ended up disliking and a movie that I thought I was going to dislike but found myself loving.  The former was BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, which I found physically beautiful to look at, but whose characters I found to be uninteresting and bland.  The latter was PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  The reason I thought that I was going to dislike it was the existence of an absolutely superb BBC mini-series, which seemed to me to be the last word on what could be done with Jane Austen's masterpiece.  I was wrong.  Not only is there room for a truly great six-hour television version but also for an excellent two-hour cinematic version.I still prefer the BBC version.  There are two reasons.  First, there probably will never be a better Mr. Darcy than Colin Firth.  Laurence Olivier might have had a shot in the 1940 Hollywood version, but that film was destroyed by an almost inconceivable rewriting of many of the key elements (the worst being making Lady Catherine de Bourgh into a matchmaker between Darcy and Elizabeth).  Matthew Macfadyen is an extremely capable Darcy, but it was as if Colin Firth were born to play the part.  The other advantage of the BBC production is time:  there is simply no way that a two-hour movie can do as good a job of adapting the novel as a six-hour production.  In watching the BBC version, one gets the sense that almost nothing of importance gets left out, whereas with the movie I found myself constantly regretting parts of the story that had of necessity to be left out.Nonetheless, there is no questioning the excellence of this new movie version.  Simply because the series does a fuller job of telling the story does not mean that this movie cannot excel in a shorter time span.  The film definitely feels abridged, yet one also feels that most (though certainly not all) of the most important bits have been retained.  With most adaptations of a novel this might not have been such a problem, but PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the best known and beloved novels in the English language (I have read it five times, see the Garson-Olivier version twice, and the BBC version three times).  Given the time restrictions, I believe the movie did as good a job as is possible.The film does have some advantages over the television version.  First, it is remarkably gorgeous to look at.  Whether we are beholding household interiors or shots of the countryside, this film was a delight to behold.  Also, with the exception of Jena Malone as Lydia and the aforementioned Colin Firth, most of the performances in the film version are a bit stronger.  I wouldn't say Keira Knightly is better than Jennifer Ehle, but she is definitely a different Elizabeth.  Let's just acknowledge that both are superb.  I recently saw Kelly Reilly (actually, all of Kelly Reilly) in the wonderful MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS.  Here is plays Miss Bingley and does a fine job.  Rosamund Pike is excellent as Elizabeth's slightly more beautiful sister Jane.  Well, she isn't noticeably more attractive than Keira Knightly, but she'll do.  Two supporting performances stand out.  First, Tom Hollander was superb as a completely different kind of Mr. Collins.  In all other versions, Collins is presented as an utter buffoon.  In defense of previous versions, Mr. Collins is a buffoon in Austen's novel.  But it is nice to see him as slightly less absurd.  And Brenda Blethyn, one of the great actresses of her generation, manages to make Mrs. Bennett into more than merely a silly cartoon.  In his book ASPECTS OF THE NOVEL, E. M. Forster makes a distinction between flat and round characters and argues that Jane Austen loves to mix the two types.  His example of a flat character is Mrs. Bennett.  And while it remains true that Ms. Blethyn isn't able to transform her into a deep character, she does keep her from being the silly twit seen in previous versions.  The one other character that did not appreciably improve upon the BBC production was, surprisingly, Judi Dench's Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  Part of the problem is that most of her scenes were shot in a somewhat subdued manner; partly she obviously decided not to play the role as a broad character.Finally, the movie works in very large part because of the chemistry between Keira Knightly's Elizabeth and Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy.  Though one genuinely misses the many big scenes early in the story in the BBC production where Darcy's pride is made manifest and Elizabeth forms her prejudices, in the romantic portions they are great together.  Also, Knightly is one of the few actresses to play the part and be the age that Elizabeth is actually supposed to be.  All in all, they click onscreen.So, I guess this should be a lesson that you shouldn't prejudge a film.  You actually can be surprised.  In fact, in the past couple of months, the two films that I most enjoyed in the theater were two that I didn't expect to like, the other being KING KONG.  So I suppose this is a lesson previously learned that has now been reinforced.	5.0	A movie I loved that I truly expected to dislike	2006-02-19	12	9	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1WWY63ZWM8YT3	"R. OBrien ""RachelReader"""	If you're an Austen newbie, this film may be acceptable, but as one who has read all of Austen's books numerous times and seen many film versions of the movies, I found this version to be very common, low-class.  It has none of Austen's charm and wit.There wouldn't have been enough smelling salts in the early nineteenth century to revive Jane Austen if she saw the pendulous pig testicles that somehow became a part of this tale.  I think that shot somehow set the tone for the movie.Mr. Bennett is not a common farmer, and he is not a drunk, although he looks like one here - he is unshaven, unkempt and wears a vacant expression throughout most of his scenes, with the exception of the near-end scene when Elizabeth and he discuss her engagement to Mr. Darcy.  Until that scene, the script all but ignores the fact that Elizabeth is his favorite daughter and that they have a close relationship.  Then, after largely remaining distant from his family for nearly the entire film, he suddenly turns emotional, tearing up, pressing his fingers to his lips and putting a hand to his chest like a teenaged girl.  This is the first time I've disliked a performance by Donald Sutherland.The other problem that stood out for me were the Kitty and Lydia characters.  These girls are silly young women, but they were not raised by wolves.  The depictions were way over the top and completely socially misrepresented the period in which this movie was set.  Their constant raucous laughter and total lack of social decorum would have fit better with modern-day 12- or 13-year-olds.My final criticism of this film is that with the exception of Jane and Mary Bennett, the girls' hair looked ratty throughout the film.By way of small compliments, I will say that this film did a couple of things better than the A&E; version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  First, it toned down the irritation factor of the Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins characters, which could have been acted more subtly in that version.  Second, it at least gave us a handsome George Wickham, which he is meant to be.  (A&E;'s version of George Wickham vaguely resembles my imagination's Ichabod Crane, and it was barely believable that Elizabeth Bennett or any other woman would have been attracted to him.)Overall, if you want to have an Austen film experience that captures the spirit of Jane Austen's amusing and genteel - not common - book, you're much better off with the A&E; version. While much longer, it captures the details that are so essential to the story.  And maybe that's another small part of the problem with this version - trying to cram this rich of a story into the typical feature-length movie format:  For me, this film felt like the script was written by someone who'd barely skimmed the Cliff's Notes.	2.0	If You're an Austen Reader, Skip It	2006-04-14	30	18	12
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2V93W0S41NV70	Robyn Pietsch	The first time I saw this movie I thought it was boring but had not seen it from beginning to end. I love period movies so it kept my curiosity up and I watched it again, and again, and again because I could not get enough of it. Sometimes first impressions are not correct!  I love to watch Kiera Knightly in just about anything and also became a fan of another great actor, Matthew McFayden whose voice is absolutly mesmerizing. His charachter in this movie is, at first, unlikable but you see the chemisty between him and Knightly develop and then all is forgiven. This is a beautiful love story set in the day when a woman's main mission is to find a husband at all costs and a time when husbands were chosen for daughters. In this movie 5 daughters were raised to be free thinkers and were able to choose the husband of their choice but if a suitor were to come along and proposed but was rejected by one of the girls, then the mother was beside herself. Knightly's charachter is ver strong and will not settle for just anyone and wants her heart to be the judge and jury when it comes to a husband,  A beautiful love story and highky recommended!	5.0	Beautiful Movie!	2013-06-08	2	2	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1FLCQRKBTADQQ	"Roger W. Davenport ""neurologyroger"""	"I have now seen every filmed version of this, the Jane Austin masterpiece, and have loved almost every version, because no matter the actors, the love story, as it overcomes pride and replaces prejudice is eternal. The original film was the only big disappointment--but my father, who was an English teacher, loved it.  The ""insufferably noble Greer Garson"" as Pauline Kael called her looked more like Mrs. Bennet than Lizzie, but Sir Laurence Olivier certainly made a handsome if somewhat earnest Mr. Darcy.  In one BBC version, Judy Parfitt played the most imperious Lady Catherine and in the last BBC performance Colin Firth made men's and women's hearts beat as the truly inscrutible and mysterious Darcy.  However, this film has its own blessings.To begin with the Bennet household looks more like the eighteenth century truth of country living than the prettier versions.  Jane is truly vapid in appearance while sweet and trusting on an intimate basis and deserves the incredibly rich and awkward Bingley.  The other Bennet daughters are irritatingly silly and Brenda Blethyn is good--although I have seen more harried and neurotic performances.  But the Lizzie of Keira Knightley and the Darcy of Macfadyen are such that there can not be a dry seat in the house at the film's conclusion.  The impish nature of Knightley and the incredibly haughty disdain of Macfadyen make the final pairing something to long for, since it seems so unattainable.  Their youthful sexuality and the characters' cast iron personalities are lusty and appealing and their ""climax"" scene, in the pouring rain, in a verdant English garden is charged with emotion and longing--especially on the part of the viewer.  It should be pointed out that they are standing in a palladian ""folly"" in the garden which makes a delightful subtitle to their recognition scene.  Judy Dench chews up everything and everyone except Keira and is unfortunately denied some of her best lines when she has her final confrontation with Lizzie.  She would have delivered them in full throat throttle.  But these are insignificant notes to a beautiful production.  Lizzie and Darcy meeting on a foggy meadow is the stuff of romance and with these two actors the sexuality crackles like lightning.If you have seen the other versions of this film, please see this one to make the experience complete.  If you have never seen a version of this film, this is a great film to begin with--and then work your way backwards.  As for me and Jane Austin, Lizzie says it best when speaking of her obsequious cousin who is living on Lady Catherine's gifts: ""I am sure that her blessings could not have been bestowed on a more grateful subject."""	5.0	Never is there enough pride and prejudice	2007-01-10	8	5	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"***1/2It seems like every time we turn around these days some filmmaker has been hard at work producing yet another adaptation of Jane Austen's most beloved novel ""Pride and Prejudice.""  And even though some of the versions have been quite good actually, one can still wonder if this glut is really all that necessary.  The book's two most recent incarnations came in the form of miniseries produced by the BBC, the first in 1980 and the second in 1995.  However, since 1940, there has not been a ""straight"" (i.e. set in the proper time period) version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" designed specifically for the big screen.  Well, now we have one, written by Deborah Moggach, directed by  Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley in the lead role.This latest version is distinguished from the earlier efforts primarily by its grittier, grimier and grungier depiction of life in early 19th Century rural England.  With its peeling paint and dusty furnishings, the film certainly has a less prettified and more lived-in look than we are accustomed to seeing in movies based on Austen works.  Yet, perhaps because we have been spoiled by the marathon lengths of those earlier miniseries, this film, at a mere two hours and seven minutes, feels hurried and rushed as it attempts to cope with Austen's complex tale of the five Bennett sisters and their mother's frantic efforts to marry them off.  We are moved so quickly through the story that some of the more subtle details of character and theme get lost along the way.  Still, it's quite remarkable just how much of the plot Moggach is able to cram into a little over two hours, so that even the staunchest of Austen purists will have little to complain about on that score.What they may have reason to complain about is the fact that the film fails to capture much of the unique humor that distinguishes the novel.  For the most part, the scenes are played much too seriously and ""straight,"" particularly those involving the odious Mr. Collins and the insufferably condescending Lady Catherine de Bourg, who together supply some of Austen's most bitingly witty commentary on the superficiality of England's class-conscious society.  Tom Hollander gives a spiritless, leaden performance as the sycophantic minister, and Judi Dench plays Lady Catherine as if she were taking a stab at Lady MacBeth instead.  The same goes for Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett, whose pivotal role as the droll, dry commentator on the absurd Mrs. Bennett's matrimonial obsessions seems to have been lost on the actor.  Matthew Macfadyen fails to make an impact as the haute Mr. Darcy, although Brenda Blethyn hits the right notes as the grating mother driven to despair at the prospect of her daughters ending up old maids.In the coveted role of the high-minded, strong willed and extremely judgmental Elizabeth Bennett - certainly the most brilliant and fully realized of all Austen's creations - Knightley clearly means well but doesn`t seem quite up to the task.  Her annoying giggle and epicene expression make her far too silly and modern to successfully portray the rational but often misguided 19th Century heroine Austen intended Elizabeth to be.Yet, despite all these weaknesses, ""Pride and Prejudice"" makes for a reasonably entertaining film, thanks, primarily, to the strength of the original source material and the liveliness of Wright's direction (the ball scenes are exceptionally well done).  The film moves quickly and does a decent job telling its story.  Perhaps if we didn't have better versions to compare it to, this ""Pride and Prejudice"" would stand up better on its own.  It's far from a failure, but watching this condensed version instead of the two BBC miniseries is a bit like reading the Cliff's Notes instead of the actual novel.  You may be able to get the general gist of the thing, but not that wonderful flavoring that makes the original so special."	3.0	gets the plot details right but misses much of the humor	2006-06-26	28	23	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1XYPOWHP06IG7	Romantic at heart	"Considering that a large majority--if not all--of the negative reviews given to Joe Wright's adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is based on their comparison to the ever-popular BBC version, I must defend the other half that finds this movie an absolute delight.First comes the matter of Wright condensing the novel to a point where it all seemed, I suspect, not enjoyable to many fans of the novel. But the fact is that Wright had two hours to portray Austen's rather lengthy novel as compared to the BBC version, which was a miniseries and, I believe, went through every single scene and detail of the novel. Not that I'm saying that there's anything wrong with that, but as a major movie fan, seeing Austen's book basically copied and pasted from the pages to a movie script, to me, lacks originality. Wright had his own original way of capturing the main plot of the movie in two hours, without dulling the characters in Austen's novel. Quickly going on a tangent, I will say that Wright's addition of the scene with Darcy and Elizabeth kissing was exceptionally romantic and it absolutely was consistent with their characters. But going back to the topic at hand: yeah, if BBC fans were disappointed that Wright seemed to rush everything, the truth of the matter is, he only had two hours. And yes, he could have included every little detail if he wanted to make the movie 5 hours.Concerning the issues regarding Keira Knightley's role as the ever-proud Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew McFadyen's role as the timid Fitzwilliam Darcy, from the negative reviews I have read, viewers are complaining that Knightley and McFadyen did not do the characters justice. However, I must strongly disagree. Knightley, the wonderfully talented actress that she is, fulfilled Elizabeth's role to the fullest extent that any person could. Elizabeth's proud and stubborn nature was fully portrayed by Knightley and I can't think of any other reason to be dissatisfied. Although, yes, Knightley might be a bit too beautiful to play the role of the more comely Elizabeth, that is just about the only possible flaw with Knightley's role as Elizabeth.As for McFadyen's role as Darcy, one reviewer stated that Darcy seemed ""dull and generally uninterested in what's going on."" Again, I must defend how Darcy was depicted in the film. To me, McFadyen acted out Darcy's role as his character is; initially, when the viewer is introduced to Darcy at the ball, he is seen as ""dull and uninterested,"" which is mistaken by others--mainly Elizabeth--as pride and conceit. That was how the reader originally felt about Darcy in the book, and that is how the viewer originally felt about Darcy in the film. Others stated, ""Austen's Darcy was well-spoken, proud and elegant, not in need of a Prozac."" However, is it just my lack of memory, or was Austen's novel not written from Elizabeth's point of view? Therefore, as Elizabeth found out about Darcy's true character, so did the reader. Wright, I believe, tried to depict Darcy's actual character to the viewers throughout the entire movie, rather than have him portrayed based on Elizabeth's prejudices. Also, Wright's version of Darcy is `well-spoken, proud and elegant,' so I don't know why one would say otherwise. As for the remark on the Prozac, is Darcy's character not clearly revealed to the viewer when he is with Georgiana in his home? I don't know what else there is to say about that. And then there's the infamous comparison between Colin Firth's acting abilities as Darcy as opposed to McFadyen. I, myself, have only seen bits and pieces of the BBC version, and from what I can tell, Firth does seem like a worthy actor to play the part of the loveable Darcy. However, I found McFadyen to not only fulfill the role as Darcy incredibly well, but I also think that McFadyen's appearances are far more handsome than Firth.The next problem many viewers had was the lack of `spark' Knightley and McFadyen seemed to have on-screen. First of all, I don't think that Wright could have picked a better couple to play the parts of Elizabeth and Darcy; not only were Knightley and McFadyen's acting abilities flawless, but their compatibility on-screen was simply amazing. One reviewer even claimed, ""[a]t the end of the mov[i]e they don't even kiss..."" which is entirely wrong. In fact, it should be switched around; Elizabeth and Darcy aren't mentioned to have kissed in the novel, but kiss at the end of Wright's film.Wright's adaptation of Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is not only original, but also highly romantic and enjoyable. For the most part it follows Austen's novel, but for the parts that it didn't, so what? It is it's own individual movie and is an `adaptation,' not an exact replica of the book; if it were, it would just be boring. I think that if people would stop comparing Wright's movie to how off it is from the book or other adaptations, viewers would actually enjoy and appreciate Wright's brilliant piece of work."	5.0	A thoroughly original and absolutely wonderful adaptation	2006-08-10	13	8	5

For that matter, I've never seen the 6-hour BBC miniseries production, so I can't presume to say whether this is a great or faithful adaptation, I can't talk about what was left out (obviously, a lot must have been) and what was changed.All I can do is talk about this as a film. And, in a word, it's great. The directing, specifically, stands out: usually adaptations of classic literature like this is shot in a flat, stuffy, unimaginative way, but Joe Wright really uses the camera to illustrate the power and emotions in the underlying material. It's never showy, but there's a mastery at work here than I haven't seen in a literary adaptation since Scorsese's ""The Age of Innocence."" It's hard to believe it's his first feature.The acting is superb, and don't get caught up (as some others have been) about the minor moments in which this film isn't literally faithful to the book. Wright and his collaborators were obviously primarily concerned with making the film work on its own, and it does, wonderfully.This film is simply a moving, beautiful story, compellingly told.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AFK33DILKFPWX	Ronald J. Weed	Sorry if the title of this review seems frivolous. As a male of the species I will get flack for this review. I am adding my bit just in case others like me like characters that are supposed to be principled individuals. The lead female Knightley and the lead male are both written in such a way, even if only on a superficial level.Still I think two parts of these characters really stand out. The leading males (Mr Darcy) somber attitude rings true of a man with a conscience and drive for ethics. This was really displayed well in the scene were he delivers an explanatory note of his actions, of how he dealt with the luitenent character, to Elizebeth (Knightly). His grave demeanor and desire to make her understand that his actions were ethically based was compelling.Second is the strong willed nature of the lead female. Displayed well in several scenes by Knightley. One of the best was when she learned Mr Darcy had broken up his sister and the doctor. She leaves the gathering and is followed by Mr Darcy, who in awkward fashion, tells her of his feelings toward her. She confronts him with the knowledge of his actions (breaking up the doctor and her sister). I can't think of many scenes as compelling. Two exceptional actors, performing to near perfection. Later Knightley is confronted with Denches character (expertly portrayed). Another scene done to near perfection. The most important scene of all, at least to me, is when she is visiting darcy's mansion, under the mistaken information that he is not there. She and her companions are walking through an art gallery on the premises. They stop at a marble bust (a likeness of Mr Darcy). Her companions ask if it is a good likeness. The brilliant acting skill of this young actress is perfect in this scene. Just in case someone of Objectivist persuasion reads this: Her characters obvious worship and respect for the man, who has proven his character to her, is displayed perfectly by Knightley.Though not the greatest plot, the acting by most of this cast is as good as it gets.Now I must watch some football.	4.0	Chick Flick Invader (rare acting skill displayed)	2007-01-18	8	4	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2RQAFTT14ZDFX	R. Pearson	"I was extremely disappointed in this version of Pride and Prejudice. If you are a fan of the book you will be in for a shock; there is a lot of ""Artistic License"" taken in this film.Kiera Knightly is a very pretty girl but, let's face it, she can not act.  She is constantly giggling in this movie in an obvious and over-acted way. It is very obnoxious. She is an extremely poor actress. They make Elizabeth out to be bookish and unkempt. In the book Elizabeth said herself that she is ""Not a great reader"" but that is exactly what they make her out to be in this film.She is not the only one in this adaptation that seems to struggle. Every time the girl who plays Lydia came on to the screen I wanted to throw something at it. She had a very over-acting-extremely-fake-British-accent. Someone really needs to tell her that overacting belongs on the stage. On Screen it is supposed to look like you are not acting.I was most disappointed that they destroyed the relationship that Elizabeth had with her sister Jane. In the book they were very close and in this movie they are no more than roommates.There are two redeeming things in this movie; which is why I gave it two stars instead of none. 1)Tom Hollander does a fabulous and hilarious job of being Mr Collins. He knows how to act, in fact he is a fantastic actor. 2) Mr. Darcy. In this version he is much more passionate about Elizabeth than in any other version I have ever seen.If you can stand it; see the film and watch the two leading men shine in their roles."	2.0	Kiera Knightly = Bad Actress.	2007-09-18	5	2	3

I think it does a very good job of keeping to the main themes and events of a beloved book while still restricting itself to a feature movie length. In fact, I didn't really miss anything that was cut out, though it does seem to speed through time rather quickly.All of the Bennetts were cast well. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennett is quite good. I felt she captured the right personality and mannerisms. Matthew Macfadyen is very good as Darcy as well. Loved Bingley and Jane, too.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A361RAEN953XE4	"Sabrina ""soyarra"""	Even as abbreviated as it is, this version of Austen's classic story is a revelation -- for once, we have a real sense of the Bennets as a middle-class country family, with pigs and chickens in the garden and crowded, energetic rustic dances for amusement.  The Bennet girls' hair is disheveled, their clothes are plain and unadorned -- in short, they're real.  I had my doubts that both Knightley and MacFadyen would be suitable in their roles, but in the end they are the most purely romantic, emotional Elizabeth and Darcy ever (and yes, I'm a great fan of the Ehle/Firth version).

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2E4OTRQ2EAGIR	Saoirse Marie	Simply put, this production of Pride and Prejudice is just lame. Mr. Bennet has not the wit, nor Darcy the charm, nor Elizabeth the grace of the characters in the book. There is hardly any romantic chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy in this film; the movie relies on skillful editing instead of skillful acting to capture the audience. The brevity of the film and the resulting omission of parts of the original story leave this film flat. A much more charming, captivating, and true-to-the-original (albeit much longer) production is the BBC/A&E production, and I would recommend that one instead.	2.0	The is production of P&P falls flat	2012-08-12	4	2	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ANA2PVMARGY8H	"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person"""	"When a coworker told me that a new version of Pride & Prejudice was in the works, I took interest.  She then said that Keira Knightley would be in it.  I innocently asked, ""Who will she play?""  ""Elizabeth, of course.""  ""But,"" I protested, ""she's too pretty to play Elizabeth."" I was thinking that unless the screenwriter excises Darcy's offensive comments about Lizzie's looks, this casting choice would be unconvincing.  In the 1940 version (with Aldous Huxley as screenwriter), Darcy (Lawrence Olivier) says that he has no time to humor the middle classes, sparing Greer Garson the evaluation of being ""tolerable, but not handsome enough...""This movie has many great qualities. It is far ""earthier"" than the A&E;/BBC 1996 production, as swine roam both outside and inside the Bennet's house, and the characters look like they've worked up a good sweat at the country dances. I also like how much more tender Mr. Bennet's character is than in the book and other productions.  Granted this is an apocryphal character interpretation, but I really liked it just the same. Donald Sutherland's take on Mr. Bennet is one of his finest performances of my awareness. Instead of continuing to chide Mary that the other ladies need a chance to exhibit their musical talents, he comforts his sobbing daughter.  Another point that I liked is that the characters really look their age.  Though I love and still prefer the A&E;/BBC production, all of the Bennet girls were played by grown-up women well into their twenties and beyond.  In this production, Lydia does look like a 15-year-old girl and Lizzie like a girl who's not yet one and twenty (with four younger sisters out, your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own my age).Due to time constraints, this movie didn't get the opportunity to really fine-tune character development and relationships. The A&E; Adrain Lukis' Wickham was so dastardly charming, yet Lizzie's initial attraction to (Rupert Friend's) Wickham and later repulsion towards him was put on fast forward and barely developed due to the movie's two hour time frame. And the man who played Mr. Collins in the A&E; production was brilliant--he apparently was cast because he was the only actor who could keep a straight face while saying some of ""the most fatuous"" lines Jane Austen ever penned. Also, Colin Firth is the hottest Darcy yet on film. Not to disparage Matthew Macfadyen, but Firth's Darcy is an impossible act to follow (though in his own right, Macfadyen did a good rendition).I enjoyed this movie and enthusiastically recommend it.  However, I still prefer all five hours of the 1996 version."	4.0	Even w/o Colin Firth, still an enjoyable adaptation	2006-06-12	8	6	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3GXTZPUEQVS1O	Sarah L. De Busk	I love the BBC version and I went into this movie knowing that nothing could compare to it.  Plus, there is no way you can take a 5 hour long movie and condense it to a 2 hr movie without losing something.  That aside, I really didn't care for there casting.  The chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy was good, but I was really disappointed in the father.  He is supposed to be a witty, sarcastic man and in this movie he almost acts sluggish, brainless man who has very little thought.  I also didn't like the fact that they made the family look like they were poor with there drab dresses and run down house.  It almost made it look unbelievable that they would every even be seen associating with Mr. Darcy or Mr. Bingley.Darcy and Elizabeth were however very cute together, and while the movie seemed like it tried to pack all the high points in, which made it seem a little rushed, it was still a cute love story.

But despite my reservations, I went ahead and watched it anyway. How I regret that decision. If I could it less than one star, I would. The story was rushed, and not just so they could trim it down to standard feature film length. The characters were portrayed all wrong, and I winced at their delivery on many occasions. The casting was okay, but how Keira Knightley received an Oscar nomination, and a BAFTA award, for this lackluster, uninspired portrayal of Lizzy is beyond me. She was dreadful. The writing was equally as bad, as they cut out many of Austen's original lines and scenes in order to put in their own weaker ideas. The scenery and cinematography were the only good points of the entire film. If you've never read the book, you'd probably enjoy this. If you have, don't bother.

I have yet to see Colin Firth's version of Pride and Prejudice, and am sure I will love it.  However, there is something about this movie that captures my full attention each time I put it on.  Every movement, facial expression, the complete immersion into the countryside and the period are rapturous for me.  Donald Southerland as I have never seen him before makes a wonderful father.  All of the girls are so much in love with each other and their family, yet each of them looks to the future with such hope in their own respective ways; although Lizzie's straightforwardness and honesty putting the appropriate people in their proper places at the proper times makes one wonder if she will end up the way her mother blatantly claims her best friend will, ""a spinster in the making"".  Each character seemed born to play their respective parts! It's just a coaster ride of emotions and engnnrossing film work, costumes (the ribbons) and dialogue that sweeps me up and I hate to see the ending draw nigh each time I watch.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A69CNG4QSNZZ4	Sara Weythman	"What a truly accessible adaptation this is.  P&P is one of my all-time favorite novels, so I'll be the first to admit that there is great license taken with some of the original content, perhaps particularly where characterization is concerned, but overall I think any changes made were reasonable and well-considered, and I can't quibble with them.  Most of the acting is excellent.  The cinematography is gorgeous.  The more ""rustic"" take on country life in Georgian England works very well , in my opinion.  This version is much less precious than any others I've seen, and of any others, this one alone does a decent job of portraying the attraction between Elizabeth and Darcy that is the center of the story."	5.0	Fantastic Adaptation	2006-07-10	8	4	4

I am a long-time Jane Austen fan and own the DVD A&E; series, but I have to admit, the newer version tells the story in its own way, with its own interpretation.  Relax and enjoy.  I applaude them for their insight and ability to find the actors and actresses that placed a new spin on the story and the characters.  If you want the purist version, only watch the A&E;, but remember it has a good five hours to tell its story, where the movie had only two hours, and did the best it possibly could in that time allotment.There were vast differences from the original storyline, but I found it entertaining and refreshing.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2MR44CIZR1IJ8	Scaramouche	"The current version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" starring Keira Knightley is a travesty. Do not see it in a theater, buy it, rent it, or watch it on television. It was a waste of time and electricity to make, and will be a waste of your time to see.There was a full-length version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" filmed in 1995, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, that remains not only unsurpassed but unequaled. It is perfectly adapted, cast, directed, acted, costumed, filmed, and scored. It preserves not only Jane Austen's intent, but the dialogue she wrote. Buy it and watch it instead.When she starred in the 1995 film, Miss Ehle did not have the blandly ""beautiful"" features or skeletal body of a model. She was, nevertheless, captivating as Elizabeth Bennet. The beauty--spiritual, intellectual, and physical--of the character she portrays increases in our esteem as we get to know her, just as it does in Darcy's. Elizabeth, as written by Austen and portrayed by Jennifer Ehle, was a mature and fascinating young woman, not a giggly,  petulant teenager with an eating disorder.Keira Knightley looks desperately in need of nourishment, and the ""lollipop-head"" figure does not work for the character she is playing. It's hard to believe that a girl of Elizabeth Bennet's time, place, and social class could have grown up so emaciated, unless she had a tapeworm.And, finally, there are many, including prominent professional critics, who commend this adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" for its ""realistic"" portrayal of dirt, unkempt clothes and hair, farm animals wallowing in the living room, etc. In fact, it is not only historically unauthentic, it is false to Jane Austen. There were no such scenes of squalor included in the novel. To the contrary, Austen wrote a passage in which Elizabeth Bennet sets out on a long walk after a rain storm to visit her ailing sister, during which she soils the hem of her skirt with mud. This slight soiling results in a small amount of embarrassment for Elizabeth, who tries to let down her outer garment to hide it, and a great amount of derision behind her back by two nasty female residents of the house she is visiting. Had dirt and shabbiness been the norm in households like Elizabeth's at the time depicted, it is unlikely a little mud on the edge of a skirt would have attracted anyone's notice or rude commentary, and these events in the book would have made no sense. The fact that Austen wrote such a scene and had the characters behave as they do indicates that cleanliness and neatness of dress were normal and expected at that place and time, among that class of people."	1.0	Skip It	2006-01-17	83	55	28

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A26ILZKBNVV14M	SChristo	The Jane Austen novel is one, that in my opinion, everyone should read. The first time I read this novel was when i was 8 years old, and though at first the colorful language of the story was difficult to comprehend, I must say, it was well worth the struggle. Now a 16 year old, I have read the book several times, and most recently, I have refallen in love with the story through the most recent production of Pride & Prejudice.Some say that they do not think that Keira Knightley being cast as Elizabeth Bennet was wise, but I think that she brought elegance to the role. She is beautiful, which differs with the book, but she does true justice to Lizzie. Her unique style of playing her is one of the reasons I was drawn to the film. I also believe that Matthew Macfadyen did a delightful job with Mr. Darcy. As the movie progressed, his softer side was revealed. Macfadyen and Knightley had chemistry that made the love passionate and real, without them, I doubt that I would truly be as fond of the film as I am.However, I must mention that I have not to this day seen the 5 hour BBC production, which I have heard is wonderful. I believe that the film is a great interpretation, and the young actors bring the passion of the romance to life. Like most have said, the socio-economic level of the Bennets could have been depicted better, and the entire Wickham story line was significantly shortened. Although despite these aspects, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The locations used along with costumes, music, and cast created a masterpiece that I can guarentee you I will buy. I was disappointed when Knightley didnt get the Golden Globe for this movie, yet I guess that's all I can expect, for she is still a young British actress in an American society. However, Mark my words, her day will come!To this day, I have seen Pride & Prejudice 3 times, and only three because it became too costly to see it at the movie theaters. This fantastic movie quickly became one of my favorites, and I am confident that it will remain one.	5.0	One to buy for the DVD collection	2006-01-20	6	4	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3SM02N4JF2NE5	Scott	"The 2005 version of Pride & Prejudice is a great movie, to be sure, to help connect modern audiences with this masterpiece. Indeed, I hated Jane Austen for 23 years, the time between high school British Lit class and that when I first saw this film in 2006.A couple of notes on the version. Macfadyen is not quite the actor that Olivier was, but he seems very real as Mr. Darcy. In fact, when he appeared in Frost/Nixon, I silently exclaimed, ""it's bleach-blond Mr. Darcy!"" The role sticks to him as if he were superglued to it.Mr. Collins is rather serious, almost to the point of mean spirited, whereas Jane Austen's version (and 1940 and 1995 screen versions) paint him as comic relief, a buffoon.Keira Knightly is perhaps the most adorable Lizzie of all, certainly one whom viewers can easily relate to and even befriend. Donald Sutherland is in the middle of the pack as Mr. Bennett overall, but his father/daughter relationship with Lizzie is rather warm indeed!Cinematographically, a bit too modern... two camera elements should be used more judiciously: Zoom/Perspective, and camera angle. In the former, there's no aesthetic benefit to seeing such frequent close-ups of characters when they speak. The two zoom close ups of Mr. Darcy's hand after it had touched Elizabeth's were obvious, nearly to the point of offensive to this viewer.As for the latter, perhaps a bit too much camera acrobatics... in a few scenes, I thought the camera was a supporting actor jealous of the attention given the star, trying to seize the spotlight where it could. The camera was a bit too dramatic at times in angle and movement.The classic (1940) employs both of these techniques, but they are so subtle as to be moving and effective, without distracting the viewer by causing their stomach to jolt with constant gritty emotion. Pride and Prejudice is a fine experience, not a visceral one.I'm compelled to point out one instance where zoom was properly used. At the end of the film, where Darcy and Elizabeth finally declare their love for each other, the use of restrained zoom on the couple was a rather moving as it created a romantic portrait. I felt sparks fly all over my body (as opposed to jolts in my entrails).Despite what I consider cinematographic shortcomings, I love the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice. It opened the door to Jane Austen for me. Nevertheless, it took a first viewing of the Olivier (1940) version five years later to finally pull me in entirely, to hook me on Jane Austen, deeply and permanently."	5.0	Great performance of P&P, accessible to modern audiences	2011-07-14	2	2	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"How does one steal a movie that sees both Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench hit high notes as supporting characters?  Keira Knightley does it by (a) playing one of the best roles in Western literature in Elizabeth Bennett and (b) nailing it.This adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a bit more scruffy (and therefore realistic) than its natural complement, Emma Thompson's adaptation of Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility.""  Everyone looks gorgeous, or course, but they also don't look like they had Hollywood hair stylists, either.  This helps the movie, as it underscores Austen's theme - England was a dangerous place for young ladies unable to get married.Indeed, just as with ""S&S;,"" marriage is the peril and promise for all the characters in the story.  Does a woman grab what she can and hope to make the best of it?  Or does she hold out for true love?  And what do two lovely parents (Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn) do when they are relatively poor and (gasp!) unconventional but have five daughters they need to send into wedlock?One is to be delighted when a rich young man rents the nearby manor and brings along his dark friend, Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen of ""MI-5"" fame).  Lizzie and Darcy fall for each other immediately, but are compelled by circumstance as well as Lizzie's pride and prejudice (you knew they'd turn up somewhere) to go through one of the greatest love stories of all time.This is a gorgeous, funny movie with several thrilling ball and dance scenes, and the camera quietly does yeoman's work as it wanders through chambers and down hallways to keep the large cast in play and the viewer well-grounded in the story.  Of course the camera also knew to linger often on Ms. Knightley's beauty just often enough!  But she is no mere adornment - this is an excellent acting performance worthy of watching on its own merits.  Watching Lizzie how head-to-head with the rich society dame who hates her (Dench) is worth the price of admission.I have not read ""P&P;,"" so I cannot respond in detail to those who complain that the filmmakers have rewritten the story somewhat.  All I would say is that there are plenty of other ""purist"" adaptations of this story as well as the book itself, and that judged on its own merits, this is one heck of a film."	5.0	Keira Knightley steals the show in wonderful adaptation	2008-09-28	9	5	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2RM4YJXOG457	Scout	The 2005 film version release of Jane Austen's timeles tale Pride and Prejudice does a far better job of representing the original novel than the old Laurence Olivier B&W; version. It lacks the thoroughness of the A&E; miniseries from the mid 1990s but fits admirably into a two hour time frame.What struck me most about this version was the depth of the characters. Unlike the A&E; rendition, these are all believeable people. The younger girls of the story especially portray characters of the maturity of someone at those ages. Although Kiera Knightly is not what I would picture as Miss Elizabeth Bennet, her skilled acting performance more than justified her selection for the role. In my opinion, she deserved the Academy Award for Best Actress. Tom Hollander as Charles Bingley is also terrific in his social affability yet someone young, naive and unsure of himself in matters of the heart. The characters of Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins were more believable while preserving their foibles intact. The elimination of inconsequential peripheral characters such as the Gardner children or Bingley's other sister and her husband contributed to a taut story.The film is not without flaws. When Miss Elizabeth encounters Mr Darcy unexpectedly at Pemberley, he offers to escort her back to town. She declines, preferring to walk. The next, brief scene shows her doing just that. Lost in the shuffle are her aunt and uncle, who presumably would never have just left her stranded at Pemberley. Again toward the end of the movie, the climatic meeting of the hearts between the two protagonists rests on contrived and forced assumptions about Lady Catherine de Bourgh's visit to Longbourn. Perhaps the result of overzealous editing to fit into a two hour time frame (2:02 of actual story, with credits 2:09), their respective references to the offended Lady Catherine's tirade just does not fit terribly well. The filmakers would have done better to add a few more minutes to make the proper connections so that this crucial scene works better.All in all, in my opnion this was one of the top two films produced in 2005. King Kong perhaps deserved more the Oscar for Best Picture (and won the British version of it) but Pride and Prejudice was a close second.	5.0	Excellent succinct adaptation	2006-04-25	26	18	8

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1PA728IKLN8SI	"Sean ""OtaBenga"""	"This was the first blu-ray disc purchased for our brand new Sony and first ever blu-ray player (Sony BDP-S590 3D Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi) and I couldn't be happier with the choice. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I've been using our new smart blu-ray player to stream episodes of ""Downton Abbey,"" ""Gosford Park,"" ""The Forsyte Saga,"" and ""He Knew He Was Right"" (Netflix only for now), but hadn't actually seen anything on Blu-Ray.  So continuing the never ending pursuit of British costume dramas, I purchased P&P; and probably have watched it about five times in the first week of owning it, including the director's cut. I'd only seen the film once in the theater when it came out but was blown away by Keira Knightley's beauty and snappy repartee; the quiet, smoldering masculinity of Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy; and one of the most romantic happy endings ever put to film.Add to all that the lush scenery, the beautiful costumes, and the sumptuous interiors, and you have the makings of an absolutely gorgeous film that would make anyone want to move to the beautiful English countryside, even for the Bennet's deteriorating working farmhouse, itself a National landmark in England. Not having had the pleasure (yet) of seeing the Colin Firth version and never having read the book (egads!), I couldn't help but be captivated by Keira Knightley as the witty Elizabeth. She more than holds her own throughout, but most especially in the confrontation scene with Dame Judi Dench's Lady Catherine, which is no small accomplishment for a young actress sharing the screen with such a legend.For those of us in the DVR age, having the ability to rewind and make sure to hear exactly what's being said is what blu-ray discs/DVDs are made for with films like this.  The pleasure in watching it is making sure to get the language that is being employed to move the plot forward or to slice and dice another character. Everyone is in complete control of his or her word choices and has the enviable ability of making feelings perfectly known but with subtlety. Don't we all wish we had such writers in our heads!I look forward to seeing Keira Kightley as ""Anna Karenina"" in Joe Wright's upcoming film adaptation this fall, their third collaboration. He may be going a bit Baz Luhrmann for that film from what I've seen so far, but with  P&P; (and ""Atonement""), he created such a gorgeous film, especially in scenes like the one where Lizzie stares at herself in the mirror, facing the possibility that she was overly harsh in letting her own prejudices fillet Darcy in one of the film's most sensuous and electric scenes. The score, just as in ""Atonement,"" is a leitmotif throughout the film and I'm almost tempted to buy the soundtrack. This is one beautiful piece of filmmaking that may supplant my two favorite movies of all time.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AYN7PWPLYCDU2	Seashell	I rarely form such a bad opinion of a movie. But this is an awful rendition of P & P. Costumes, casting, sets, almost all bad. They set the Bennets in squalor. The casting is terrible. Knightly, while a good actress, is really not suited for the part. Better as Jo from Little Women I would say. Mr. Darcy is not at all a romantic lead and does not pull off the arrogance he is supposed to have had. Mr. Bingley is beyond ridiculous. Even Judi Dench who I always look forward to seeing did not make a very good Lady Catherine. She appeared almost nice! The performance made Elizabeth's wit not justified but impudent.Above all they were not faithful to the story: adding, omitting, and totally garbling scenes and lines. An example being Mr. Darcy's first proposal: one of my favorite scenes from the book was totally changed, in location, weather, words, etc.Everyone I've talked about the movie with disliked it. All in all it may be a good movie in it's own right but has no claim to being Pride and Prejudice.The BBC/A&E; series is much to be preferred.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A19WJUSQMSQPV	Seka	Well, I didn't mind that the Bennets lived on a farm - I minded that they were then called the Bennets. I didn't mind that Bingley was a fool, but the fact that they called him Bingley. I didn't mind that Elizabeth clearly liked Darcy from the beginning, but I did mind that they called her Elizabeth.Really, I didn't mind this movie at all. What I did mind is that they called it Pride and Prejudice. It was NOT Pride and Prejudice, it was only loosely based on that book. Elizabeth would NEVER tell Darcy to call her Goddess Divine or any one of the other names. Mr. Bennet would NEVER show such affection for his wife and daughters so openly (with the exception, of course, of Jane and Lizzy). Mr. Darcy would NEVER have gone walking toward Elizabeth's house in the middle of the night in only his night clothes (and, for that matter, his aunt would never leave her mansion in the middle of the night, especially not to visit him and Elizabeth)Still, the movie had some great parts. The scenery was amazing. The scene in which Darcy and Elizabeth first touch hands, beautiful. Maybe if it had a different name, I would have given this movie more stars. It's just that they called it Pride and Prejudice, and it was not, so I can not.	3.0	Not Pride and Prejudice	2007-07-08	13	6	7

Of course, many purists will object to the lack of adherence to the book in this particular adaptation however they seem to miss out on one word in the description, ""based."" The movie is BASED on the book. No matter if you've never read Pride and Prejudice in your life and are seeing the film for the first time, or you've read all of Austen's work and own many adaptations that you yourself enjoy, this version is just as charming and profound, odd as those two words sound in a sentence. The imagery and music certainly make up for the lack of certain plot devices and characters.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1HU1MYFDGTN61	"S. Gregory ""Pocketbat"""	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is almost a necessity for any lover of literature.  It is, perhaps, her most famous piece and has been adapted a number of times.  This latest adaptation does not disappoint.I absolutely love the BBC edition - I've watched it in one whole day a number of times, to the point where I can recite the lines as the actors say them.  I was tentative about this new Pride and Prejudice, worried that it would bring Austen's world crashing down to the ground with bad, flashy acting.  However, the story still holds the same lovely charm of Austen's story, without being too similar to the BBC movie or too far removed.My biggest criticism is that the movie was too short.  For lovers of the BBC movie, this can be a large drawback.  Things happen so quickly (although the movie is 129 minutes long) and there seem to be so many gaps left.  Wickham, for instance, is only seen once or twice, his character completely undeveloped in the movie.  However, this new Pride and Prejudice was meant to cater to the general public and a five hour re-enactment may have weared a number of the viewers.Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightly are both different from Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, yet they still maintain the original charm of the character they are playing.  Knightley's biggest dissimilarity is the fact that she is stick thin, whereas gentry in Austen's time were of a more stout constitution, since a rounder woman meant the family could afford to be well fed.  Her acting, except for a crying scene, is almost flawless.  Macfadyen plays a different Darcy from Firth's haughtier take on the character; Macfadyden is more shy than he is proud.  But he does a good job, and the scene between him and Knightley in the rain is one of the most romantic scenes in any movie.The film, moreover, does not have the glamorize the story, but the house is dirty, hair is messy, things are out of place and imperfect, adding a whole new sense of reality to the movie, something I think the BBC production might have missed.For any lover of Pride and Prejudice, I do no think you will be disappointed in this rendition.  Or, if you are, it will merely be because so much of the story had to be omitted.  For me, I felt between Knightley's Elizabeth and Firth's Darcy, the world of Pride and Prejudice was well rounded and remained true to what Austen had dreamed up.	5.0	A Must-Have for Austen Lovers	2006-05-18	16	12	4
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A28G30FW804N4I	"sgspecker ""sgspecker"""	I'm a big fan of the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice staring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. Maybe it's due to the fact that it was the first version I saw, but it's always been a favorite. (Who couldn't fall in love with Greer Garson?)I'm not sure if I wanted to like this version or not... but in the end, it won me over. So much so that I seem to watch it over and over again.Keira's performance is outstanding, she had me hooked in the first scene. For some reason it took me longer to warm up to Matthew as Mr Darcy, then again, his character does appear cold and aloof at the beginning of the film. In the end, it would be hard to imagine another playing the role; he won me over, just as he did Elizabeth. The supporting cast is just as strong, so no issues there.Setting aside the great acting and wonderful story, this is - plain and simple - one of the most beautiful movies to watch. Between the breathtaking scenery, as well as the lush score, it's hard not to just let the Blu-ray keep playing on repeat mode.In the end, though, it's Keira's performance that elevates this movie to excellence. She just doesn't strike a wrong note in this performance.	5.0	Gorgeous release of a classic movie	2012-11-24	2	1	1
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2TGSOYDF69X7O	Shadowfax44	When version first came out, I watched it with great anticipation for liking it.  I love Jane Austen, have a Jane Austen related web site, and I am pretty easy to please when it comes to Jane movies.  But I really disliked it.  This past week I thought I would give it another try, and watched it again.  I still really really disliked it. I just think it was poorly portrayed. The Bennet family is made to look excessively poor, grimy and shabby, and not portrayed as the gentlemen's family that they were. Kitty and Lydia were just foolishly, cartoonishly ridiculous, to the point of absurdity. The ball scenes were frenetic and overly crowded, again to the point of absurdity. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth was not likable in any part of the movie - her portrayal was too modern. The entire pace of the movie was too fast - the dialogue was so fast to the point of not being able to understand it at times (and I am not old and I watch British period dramas frequently and so am used to the language). Mr. Bingley seemed a buffoon, which he is not. Mr. Darcy was just never appealing. Their eventually romance seemed implausible.  The whole thing just seemed forced. Jane Austen's subtle humor was never fairly portrayed.It seemed like they wanted give these characters a modern feel while keeping them in early 19th century setting, and it just didn't work. I'm all for modernizations and retelling of Pride and Prejudice, and am a HUGE fan of the Lizzie Bennet Diaries on YouTube.Of course, by far the best Pride and Prejudice portrayal is the Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth 1995 BBC version.

The actor that played Darcy got better as the film wore on, but let's face it there is only one Darcy, but I liked this take on Darcy, he has a kind face and that wears on you..in a good way.  I really liked Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett, his scene at the end with Knightly really got to me, it was perfect.  The period costumes where also well done and they well deserve their Oscar nomination.  The DVD extra's are wonderful, especially the background on Austen...so sad she never found her Darcy, but alas, that's probably what made her such a great romantic writer, dreams are often better than reality.	5.0	AUSTEN'S PRIDE	2006-02-19	7	5	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A13STKDYQO5DQ8	"S. Hebbron ""S B H."""	This is a really engaging and quite authentic production of Austen's great work. There is less of the frothy romaticising of the time and much more of gritty determination to represent the period and the evidence of class division. Equally, Austen's great wit and simmering sarcasm are brought to life more vividly. I have been given to be a little harsh about the artisitic ability of Keira Knightly in the past, but here she utterly redeems herself and shows a level of talent that is confidant and appealing. She injects into Elizabeth Bennett, the fiesty and forthright nature, out of tune with the requirements of her time, that I believe Austen intended her to have. The relationship between Knightly and Pike (Sisters Elizabeth and Jane) is girlish, affectionate and charming. Brenda Blethyn is perfectly dotty and anxst ridden as Mrs Bennett is intended to be and Donald Sutherland is world weiry whilst dotishly  parental.The simmering romance is evident and heartfelt and for all that people have long adored Firth's Darcy, Macfadyen injects this awkward and snobbish, cold-fish with a sense of heartbreaking tenderness and vulnerability not before seen; and it is all the better for it.Dench is utterly and obnoxiuosly brilliant and the Grand and Judgemental de Borg. And the sets are magical and actual representations of great English homes of the period. Well worht the effort and thoroughly well done for it's quality of acting, sense of action and pathos and departure from the frothy nostalgia of so many classic novel, film versions.	5.0	A lovely production.	2006-09-22	12	6	6
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A32GGQEOYSAGGA	S. Hedberg	This movie is reason enough to contemplate burning the book.  Although Jane Austen's original work was not the best, this movie is the epitome of monotony.  Nothing interesting happens at all.  It is essentially one of the most generic and boring styles of cinema: a love story with no twists and no added elements of suspense or uncertainty.  Again, Hollywood fails to do anything more than reprint a book on screen and bore us all to death in the process.  Make no mistake:  the book itself had many flaws, and though considered a classic work of literature, it was incredibly slow-paced and left the reader searching frantically for adrenaline to keep his or her heart beating.  Nevertheless the movie falls into this trap in a far worse way than the book; by the end, you seriously wonder what happened to the last two hours of your life.  The conclusion is unfulfilling at best.  You know precisely what will happen from about twenty minutes in, and it never changes.  No surprises whatsoever.  Even by today's low standards for cinema, this is pathetic.  I honestly cannot see why anyone would want to see this movie, and I've been pondering the positive reviews on amazon.com for hours.  It is not nearly as good as everyone else believes and certainly not worth eight dollars.	1.0	A Travesty for the Body, Mind, and Soul	2005-11-27	36	6	30

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AC744LW4D4U9G	Shemogue	"I've seen all the filmed versions of Pride & Prejudice, and found each one to be enjoyable in its own unique way.There is no reason to remake a film if it is going to be exactly like the one before, and with this latest version of  P&P;, director Joe Wright, who is quite a young man, was obviously unwilling to create just another clone. Instead he has chosen to shock us a little by his attention to realism in the settings and activities surrounding the characters - using social documentary, circa 1797, to emphasize the differences in social status of the family groups in the story.I particularly like the scene where the Bennet ladies visit Netherfield when Jane is sick.  They all sit on the sofa in their best, but dated ""provincial"" Georgian clothes, while Caroline Bingley is dressed in the height of fashion in an elegant high-waisted Empire gown.Life in an English country manor 200 years ago was far from palatial. Even Great Houses were dark and drafty and often dirty.  There was no indoor plumbing, electricity, washing machines, drycleaning, cooking ranges, refrigeration, vacuum cleaners, or central heating. Fireplaces smoked, floors creaked; roofs leaked; water and wood and coal was carried in; ashes and slops were carried out. Livestock was everywhere and flies followed them. There were not even any commercial soaps or cleaning materials - you had to make your own from caustic chemicals.  New furnishings, drapery and carpets were expensive, and hand-me-downs were valued, even if threadbare and faded.Austen mentions only 2 indoor servants at Longbourn - the cook and Hill, the maid of all work, and both would have worked long hours. The daughters would have had to make up the slack, although Mrs Bennet makes it clear cooking was beneath them.  Even the family's riding horses must do double duty on the farm. Life at Longbourn would not have been up to the standards of Rosings and Pemberley, which though they were palaces, would have suffered the same housekeeping difficulties as Longbourn -  but would have more servants to throw at the problems.Jane Austen devoted few words to descriptions of houses and housekeeping. She expected her readers would be familiar with life in various social milieus. We have been reading between the lines, and our reading has not always been accurate, if one is to judge from the disappointed comments of some viewers.This version will never replace the earlier versions, but it does add another point of view, as the film ""Clueless"" did for ""Emma"". Wright has taken some liberties with the characters, making Mrs Bennet more sympathetic.  I found the dialogue was rather mumbled, but,like most Janeites, I  know it  by heart so it didn't matter very much.  I expect the film's biggest audience will be Janeites who already know the story & appreciate a fresh look at it.  Just think of all those versions of Shakespeare's plays & no one has got tired of doing another after 400 years."	4.0	social history circa 1797	2007-02-14	9	8	1

Yes there are some things that were not in the movie that were in the book, Yes there were some things in the movie that were not in the book. However the story does go on and not skipping a beat of action.  Since buying the movie I have watched it about 10 times in a month.The scenery is beatiful and so are some of the houses.I can not tell what part of the movie was the best or which I loved more, cause I loved the whole movie.  Some people said they did not like the movie, but they named Kiera as the reason they did not like it. She was the whole movie cause she played Lizzy, I wonder if they just don't like her?  For I have seen most of her movies and they were all good.

They set the standard for the telling of this story, hands down. Now having said that, I must say that watching this version, I had to adjust myself to the thinking that this is a different retelling of this story. This is a more primitive, faster paced telling than the BBC version. Now personally, I think that cheats the story, rich as it is, and the portrayal of Bingley being a dolt-that seemed uncalled for. But that being noted, it's not bad. It's watchable if you think of this as the MTV version of a classic, revised and motivated to attract minds with the attention span of a gnat, not a faithful portrayal of JA's story for the masses. The masses need to watch the version with Firth and Ehle. I bought this with an open mind, and other than a few slight annoyances (did everything have to look so dirty?), I wasn't disappointed.My test of approval is ""Will I watch it again""?

This movie focuses more on Mr. Dacy and Lizzie's relationship.  I loved the movie. Three stars rating is due to the two disc collector's edition.  It is a waste of money.  It is two copies of the movie. I don't need two of the same movie.  The extras aren't worth the cost.  I wouldn't buy this two disc collector's edition.

While I like the casting of characters in this one, the setting left a LOT to be desired, and the shortness left out the development of the characters and the relationships. Jane and Lizzy have little warmth or closeness in this version as there is no time to develop the relationship. Everything is too much abbreviated for comfort. Anyone seeing this and not having read the book as often as I and some other avid readers would come away feeling it was too shallow a story. Few of the statements from the book carry into the movie, as they did in the BBC versions. It's too different from the book for my liking, although I will continue to view it from time to time along with the others.	3.0	"Just ""okay""."	2006-07-29	10	5	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3IMNEEOZFWP7	"Shiloh ""Musicale"""	"Ok, for starters, let me just say that I knew this movie would not be BBC's 5 hour long movie which in my opinion is the best version out there, and I knew that it would be much more condensed. I was fine with that, really. I teach British Lit in high school and I was really looking forward to being able to show my students a Pride and Prejudice movie, instead of just small clips.But after the first five minutes of watching this, I knew there was no way I was going to show this in class. The list of reasons for that is so long, I won't be able to list them all, so I'll try to do a better job of condensing them than this movie did.1. The characters themselves were not true to the book at all. Elizabeth Bennett is probably my favorite character of all time. She's lively, finds humor in just about everything, extremely intelligent considering she had virtually no schooling, and a natural wit that could rival any scholar. In the movie, she's a hissing, snarling bad-tempered thing with a chip on her shoulder. The writers seemed to take her propensity to find humor in others' ill behavior and twist it into making fun of just about everyone.And then there was Mr. Darcy...ok, I knew going into this that I probably wouldn't like this rendtion more than Colin Firth's, but I had an open mind and was willing to give him a chance. And he wasn't all that bad, but paired with Keira Knightley's portrayal of Elizabeth, this movie just spun off into a ditch.Mr. Bennett is a private, well-humored man stuck in a bad marriage. He is not whipped as he appears to be in this movie. The fact that the writers changed up a lot of the lines he had in the book to ""modernize"" the movie, did nothing to aid his character in the least.2. The movie moves along way too fast. Again, I know it couldn't be five hours, but this was just ridiculous. The actors spoke so fast that even I, a hardened P&P; veteran who could quote just about any line in the book had a hard time following the dialogue.For instance, the scene at Rosings when Elizabeth, the Collinses (and Maria Lucas if her character had not been cut from the movie) are dining with Lady Catherine, the dialogue went so fast I almost got whiplash. Judi Densch had the potential to be the best Lady Catherine of all time in fact I was really excited about seeing her in this movie, but her screen time was cut so short, her lines so diluted that it's extremely easy to forget her. And believe me when I say that Jane Austen did not write Lady Catherine de Bourgh in a way that would make her so easily forgottten.3. They cut out too many supporting characters, ie Mr. and Mrs. Hurst (Mr. Bingley's sister and brother-in-law), The Forsters, Mr. and Mrs. Phillips (Mrs. Bennett's sister and brother-in-law), and Lady and Maria Lucas. Again I know that time was a constraint, but all of these characters actually do play a vital role in the book.4. And finally the BIGGEST complaint I have about this movie is Darcy's first proposal scene. Not only is not in Charlotte's Parlor and in the middle of Hunsford's grounds in a random gazebo structure in the rain (I guess to make it more ""dramatic""), Mr. Darcy goes on to explain everything right then and there. Which I tell you right now is something Fitzwilliam Darcy would NEVER have done. He's too prideful, hence the title of the book/movie.There was no letter, no suspense as the audience watched Elizabeth come to realize that everything she knew about Wickham was wrong and what everyone seemed to think of her family's behavior in general. One of my favorite parts of the book is where Mr. Darcy storms out of the Collinses parlor and Elizabeth is left fuming. And then there's the awkwardness with which he delivered the letter to her. Instead, I was the only one left fuming as I watched Elizabeth practically throw herself at Darcy after his explaination and by that point I actually shut off my DVD player and took a break. I could not believe that anyone could butcher such a great book so effectively.In conclusion, this movie is HORRENDOUS! The only thing this movie did better than the BBC version is that characters are actually much more pleasing to look at, but that's it. Jane Austen is probably rolling around in her grave right now because these people just ripped her work to shreds.And the worst part is, I now have students coming in every year that think they know all there is to know about Pride and Prejudice, but when they actually start to read the book they start asking questions like... ""Wait, who's Maria Lucas?"" and ""What happened to the Gazebo?"", and ""Where the hell did this letter come from?"" and ""Wait, Bingley has another sister?"" and my absolute favorite, ""Why is Elizabeth so nice?"" It's gotten to the point where I have to give a disclaimer at the start of each year, telling them that in no way shape or form should they watch this movie if they haven't already, and if they have they should forget everything.Do not let your children watch this movie. Please. You'll be doing a favor to every English teacher out there. You want to watch a Pride and Prejudice movie that isn't 5 hours long, but still relatively accurate, watch the 1970s version or even the 1940s version. Acting's not quite as good, but they still top this movie about 100 times over. If I could've given this movie 0 stars and still reviewed, I would have."	1.0	Not for true fans of Jane Austen's works	2011-10-29	20	12	8

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3CYZTKCR4MW2M	Shirley Holmes	This pride and prejudice is the finest I've ever watched.The Mother  is not overdone at all but is still her same old self.Lidia is not over done like she is in the A&E version with Colin Firth. Kity is very good. Mary is not over done like all the other mary's did you ever notice that all the bennet sisters were fine robust pretty girls all that is except Mary who is allways sooooo plain thin and boring.inthis one she has the same caracter only she isn't rediculously thin or ugly...Like the one from The A&E version(Colin Firth)Jane is the best Jane ever, no one could ever get a better one. Unlike the A&E version she does have a chance at being prettier that Elizabeth. Elizabeth is perfect she has the perfect everything like her better than A&E's. Keira Knightly and Rosamond Pike are beautiful as elizabeth and jane.Mathew Macfayden is the best MR.Darcy ever He looks yunger, more handsome, and thinner/taller than colin firth.Ah Mr. Bingly is such a breath of fresh air after the A&E one. He is perfect.all the others mr Bingly's i felt embarressed for they weren't very good actors. Mr bennet I like better he seems more responsible and more kind like when he hugs mary after saying she can't play the pianon at the ball. All the other fathers ust seem so much more heartless.So all in all this is the best one yet and is definatly worth seeing for parents with kids they do have 2 bad words in it but no inapropriate sceens especially with lidia and Wicome. Unlike A&E version again.And lidia just has a dirty mouth in the A&E one. so I definatly recomand this movie to the whole family.	5.0	Best of the yearBest of Pride&Prejudice!	2006-08-11	10	5	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2XY9RF0M4B7UF	Shirlz	As a fan of both the book and the 1995 BBC version, I have to say this was a wonderful effort by both the cast and director.The 1995 version is faithful to the novel, but then again, it had 5 hours to tell the story.Time restrictions on this film of course lead to the omission of various scenes and characters but the director gives you enough to understand the story fully.Visually, it's a beautiful piece of film. The sets were awe inspiring. And that sunset scene at the end--oh my, was so glorious.Macfadyen is simply breathtaking as Mr. Darcy. He is easy on the eyes. One thing I loved is that he seemed to really show, by way of his mannerisms, Mr. Darcy's awkwardness and insecurities. When he grabs Elizabeth's hand, that first instant of skin to skin contact, his reaction is heartwarming. In another instance, when he enters the room and surprises Elizabeth, the way he just played with his gloves was amazing and it really gave you insight as to what Mr. Darcy was feeling at the moment. Colin Firth was exceptional as Mr. Darcy but Macfadyen gave him a good run for his money.Kiera did a nice job as Elizabeth. A wonderful effort on her part.All in all, the film was a fine effort. I thoroughly enjoyed it and although I prefer the 1995 version (because of its wholeness and Mr. Colin Firth), the film is a visual stunner, and worth seeing.	5.0	A great effort!	2010-03-16	3	3	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ANK76360Q8YU2	shortandsweet	I am a Jane Austen freak. I love her novels.I am ALSO a HUGE fan of the Pride & Prejudice mini-series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. It has to be one of the most watched sets of DVDs in my collection.That said, I was expecting to go into this movie and be disappointed. I mean, it was hard enough to adapt the novel into a nearly 6 hour mini series. How in the world would they get it down to 2 hours and 7 minutes? Would it be Jane Austen on speed?I must say, though I was not thoroughly pleased (though I expected I would not be), I was most certainly not disappointed either! :o) All the acting was well done. It was interesting to see different takes on the Bennett girls. After time, I adjust to Keira Knightley's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett. McFadden wasn't broody enough in my opinion. He just seemed shy more than proud. I must give much credit to my enjoyment of the acting to Mr Bingley. He was PERFECT. :) Yadda yadda yadda. You'll all form your own opinions.My only qualms with the film was the beautiful shots of the country/Lizzie. They were too long! Beautiful, but too long. I think SO much character development/relationship development could have been helped if they would have taken a few less of those shots, and had another family scene. I really missed Lizzie and Jane's relationship. Wickham was nearly cut out! I missed the culture of the time! The lack of showing this really destroyed a lot of Jane Austen's disdain for the upper crust of society.So I'm rambling, but that's how I feel in a nutshell!	3.0	Avid fans won't be too disappointed.	2005-12-26	13	6	7

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1XEFHQZP8Y35W	Silver Screen	"The most recent rendering of Jane Austen's masterpiece ""Pride and Prejudice"" is not the A&E; version that I own and adore, but it stands well on its own.I'll admit, being a Colin Firth as Darcy fan, and a huge fan of the A&E; version, I was prepared to dislike this movie, and dislike it intensely.  While it was not as good as the A&E; version, I did enjoy the film.My biggest problems?  First, and perhaps most importantly, the length.  A&E; did a five hour masterpiece, with wonderful character interpretations, dialogue and a general overview of Austen's cultures and times.  This version, coming in at 2 hours, requires certain characters and plotlines to be abbreviated, or left out entirely.  Which leads to problem number two.  Lizzy's Uncle and Aunt Gardiner are barely represented here, although they play a huge role in the book (and the A&E; version).  Bingham's sister and brother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, have been axed.  Caroline Bingley has few scenes.  We never see her meeting up with Jane in London.  Mr. Collins and Charlotte have very few scenes. You are not left with the impression that Charlotte and Lizzy are good friends, but maybe just acquaintances.  Lady Catherine de Burgh (played wonderfully icy by Judi Dench)appears in perhaps two scenes.The Bennets themselves, with the exception of Mr. Bennet, are woefully underrepresented.  Despite the loveliness of the actress playing her, you don't get a sense of Jane's modesty, shyness and affection for Bingley.  You also don't get a sense of the close bond that Lizzy and Jane shared.  Mrs. Bennet in this version lacks the hysterics and dramatics that the A&E; Mrs. Bennet possessed - - to the detriment of this film, in my opinion.  Mary, Kitty and Lydia seemed to be simply secondary characters, at least until Lydia runs away with Wickham . . but even then, the viewer may not have the impression of what a huge lout Wickham is, nor how precocious Lydia was.  All in all, having to tell such a beloved love story, with so many characters, is a daunting task, but a very difficult one in two hours or less.  As a result, this version feels rushed - - there is no feeling that nearly a year has passed since Bingley has seen Jane, or since Darcy and Lizzy first met.Now, what is good about this version?  The two lead actors are wonderfully endearing.  No, Keira Knightly is not Jennifer Ehle and Matthew MacFadeyn is not Colin Firth.  But they are very sweet together and have definite chemistry.  When I heard that Knightley was cast as my favorite literary character, originally, I was horrified.  But I have to say that she does a very credible job.  Again, she plays Lizzy very differently than Ehle does, but it works in this film.  The scenery is absolutely beautiful and the music is absolutely perfect for a timeless love story.All in all, I enjoyed this film.  If I had to choose, I would take the A&E; version over this one - - just because Firth and Ehle are impossible to top, and the five hour mini-series was simply magnificent, in casting, direction, sets, etc.But for a 2 hour Jane Austen fix, this movie is worth a watch."	4.0	Not the A&E/BBC version, but still worthy	2006-03-27	11	7	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1A8147D4ZQFNX	Smriti Rangan	I have seen both the 95' version with Firth and Ehle and this one with Keira and Matthew. I have to say that I liked the 2005 version much better. I just didn't feel the chemistry between Firth and Ehle. And they seem a lot older than the characters in the book. Colin Firth too I felt was too stiff faced and did not bring out the emotion or torment he felt. He keeps staring at Ehle like he wants to hit her.I thought Matthew Macfayden was a real find in this movie. He really seemed to bring out all the range of emotions he felt. Keira knightly too was very good in her role.The movie though I felt was short and had some scenes I would have liked to see cut out, was a wonderful adaptation of the novel itself.The rain scene where Darcy proposes and the last scene where he comes at dawn to talk to Lizzie was spot on. I couldn't have asked for a better adaptation there.On the whole if you have read the book this movie is a must see.	5.0	Lovely adaption of the novel	2010-03-17	4	2	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A26A64X86VL1R4	Snowbrocade	Pride and Prejudice is an old favorite of mine.  Austen has a knack for writing about relationships.  There is a fine subterranean stream of masked sexuality contrasting with the formal social necessities of her era that create a wonderful tension in her novels.  The director picked up on this element and created a wonderful movie.Pride and Prejudice was gorgeously and authentically filmed.  The period was pre-regency--in the early Napoleonic wars--one not so commonly portrayed. The men pose in outfits that evoke some of the portraits of Napoleon.  All of the locations are stunning making the most of ancient trees and beautiful mansions.The film portrayed the ramifications of what it meant to be the daughters of poor gentry in this era.  The girls simply must marry in order to survive.  Yet they were looked down upon for their aspirations to marry well.  Also, their lower social status made them prey to men who might exploit these women for sex.  In most cases marriages were simply financial transactions--merging of assets.Matt McFayden was the perfect choice to play the proud man who is humbled by his love for a woman impossible for him to marry because she is not in his social class.  When he decides that his love for her is so great he cannot be without her, his pride and a series of misunderstandings cause Lizzy (Keira Knightly) to reject him. McFayden and Knightly play the star-crossed lovers with the restrained intensity called for by the social manners of the time. In particular McFayden is devastating as the heart-broken lover.This movie succeeded visually, as a psychological portrait of a social era and most importantly as a great romance.	5.0	Hot and sexy, in a mannered English drawing room style!	2006-05-21	17	12	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ADUDP6PUDA2Z1	snow	No, really, and I've seen them all. Of course this is my learned opinion so read at your own risk. Keira Knightly - excellent. Actually most of the cast (Bingley was a little too goofy) were terrific.For the critics that say Macfayden was a little too wooden,they had a point in two or three places at most. But it doesn't detract from his overall portrayal. He never looked maudlin or sappy even once - unlike Colin Firth at the last third of the A&E; version. No trashing me now, I love that one too. But Macfayden came across as a real, believable person. So did Donald Sutherland and I was prepared to dislike him from the first. Instead,I was charmed!Indeed, I'm one of those dedicated little P&P; fans who has the book memorized. I can say with all true feeling that Matthew Macfayden is better then the Darcy version that's lived in my head for the last 30 years.And that's sayin' somethin'.  :)	5.0	Best. Darcy. Ever.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3943KDQAJM85A	Snow White	Being fully aware of the backlash stating my take on the most beloved of the works of Miss Jane Austen I shall attempt to be as brief as possible, by purely stating my own opinion.First of all I will admit that this adaptation of the darling tale does speed through a bit faster than to be desired, but one must remember that this version was made for the cinema, and therefore does not have the advantage of the BBC mini series. On the other hand the fact that it is shorter in length makes it much more feasible for the hundreds of viewings I have endured blissfully.However in nearly every other category I prefer this rendition. I honestly find very little fault in absolutely anything in this movie. The principle actors portray each of their characters in the most beautiful, poetic manor. Particularly I adore Simon Woods as the nave Mr. Bingley, his eyes sparkle and I find myself believing every little word he speaks.Joe Wright did the most admirable job directing such a fantastic film, finding romance and tension in the smallest of actions between Elizabeth and Darcy. When Darcy offers his hand to help Elizabeth into the carriage, the moment is just breathtaking. Not to mention the cinematography and scenery are gorgeous scene after scene.Movie aside, the soundtrack encompasses some of the most beautiful music I could imagine; Most of the tracks by Jean-Yves Thibaudet are in high rotation on my itunes, my personal favorite being `Liz on top of the World.'.It's surreal.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2J1WFUYTHVKW2	S. Rosenhan	I love Jane Austen's novels and wasn't sure how well I'd like this film version. But I was pleasantly surprised. If you are a purest, you may be a little frustrated by what is omitted in order to fit this into a feature film length, but by and large I couldn't really disagree with the director's choices here.  My favorite film version for fidelity to Austen's text is still the BBC version made in the 1980's staring Elizabeth Garvie. But this one is worth your time because it tells the stories of characters you love from a new perspective. This telling is focused on making the Bennets, as a family, believable in their interactions with one another, even if it means softening the flaws of each character a little. For example, traditionally inattentive Mr. Bennet is shown comforting Mary who breaks into tears after her musical performance is rejected at the Netherfiled ball.  I also thought Kira Knightly did a nice job of portraying Elizabeth as someone who really does love to laugh.	4.0	Fun Perspective on a Favorite Story	2007-01-09	5	3	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2NKT7SAP6D3XU	S. Schomburg	"Granted that no film can capture an entire book, but rather its essence, this film interpretation of Austen's perennial classic does not live up to the novel on which it was based.  Instead of going for the light, clever, witty world Austen created in her novel, Joe Wright chose to turn Pride and Prejudice into some sort of heavy-handed, proto-Brontean melodrama.  It ignored the iconography of several scenes which are of critical importance to the story (for example, Darcy's first proposal is filmed outside, in the rain! which means that the difference between Elizabeth being cornered inside during the proposals she rejects and outdoors when she finally accepts is no longer present), and some of the lines (""You have bewitched me, body and soul...""--give me a break!) are just plain cheesy.There are also several glaring socio-historical errors in this screenplay, not the least of which is Mr. Bingley nursing an ailing Jane back to health; a young gentleman would NOT be in a young woman's bedchamber (who was not in his immediate family, which Jane is not), especially when she was in a state of undress.  The lack of concern for nuances of etiquette between characters, lack of awareness of difference of behavior between classes, etc. also evinced a general ignorance of or concern for accuracy in portraying a book written by an author for whom such manners formed the basis for much of her works' humor.  Watching incidents like these are frustrating just plain painful to anyone who has spent any time with Austen.That being said, there were a few aspects of the screenplay which are worthy of note.  The liberties taken with Charlotte Lucas (in which she goes into some detail about her reasons for marrying Mr. Collins) are well-done and point out to modern audiences the plight of the spinster in Regency-period England.  Likewise, a softer, gentler Mrs. Bennett is different from the 1995 BBC version (which is the standard by which P&P; interpretations will CONTINUE to be judged, thanks to this overall mediocre silver screen version), but not necessarily unwelcome.  However, several secondary characters are missing from the cast, and their loss, although not of central importance to the plot, does diminish the overall impression which is present in Austen's novel, and is yet another unfortunate aspect of this version's screenplay.  They completely dropped a sister; without the bookish Mary, there is no foil to contrast Kitty and Lydia's reckless and unrestrained foolishness, two extremes of feminine behavior.  The other omission is of the Hursts (Bingley's other sister and her husband), as is their contribution to the picture of married life presented in the book (there is only one married couple in Austen's book which appears to be genuinely happy: the Gardiners, Elizabeth's aunt and uncle, and thank goodness the writer(s) at least had the good sense to at least keep them in!).Aside from the flaws in the screenplay, the acting by two of the main ""Big Name"" acting draws of this film, Keira Knightley as heroine Elizabeth Bennett and Judi Densch as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, is unremarkable.  While Densch gives merely an indifferent performance of her part as British actress ""of a certain age"" (rather than bringing any particular vitality to her character, an overbearing aristocrat and self-styled ""patroness""), Knightley's acting is actually flawed; at no point in the film is she actually convincing in her part--she was too busy playing Keira Knightley in a long, old-timey dress.Although the cinematography and costuming in this picture are beautiful and beautifully done, they is not enough to save this lukewarm interpretation of a wonderful book, and I have a feeling the only reason it has been as warmly received as it has is because not many people bother to read the original anymore.  Nobody involved with the making of this film (excepting, perhaps, those competent few who were in charge of wardrobe and props) ought to be allowed anywhere NEAR Austen's works again."	3.0	"Pretty film, but didn't really ""get"" Austen..."	2007-01-14	22	13	9

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1RNE1P7FQ8CWP	S. S. Scott	"If you must have a video version of Jane Austen's classic work, then the 95 BBC adaptation is for you.  It is truer than any other adaptation (and I've seen them all) to the spirit, wit, and characters Miss Austen created centuries ago.This version, on the other hand, while it has some redeeming qualities making it worthy of a rental viewing - the scenery, cinematography, and score are uniformly excellent - it is a very poor rendition of P&P.;  Although I agree that the youthful energy shown by all 5 Bennet girls is an interesting take on the story, there are so many flaws and wasted opportunities in this work that I cannot in good conscience recommend a purchase.  A short list of the flaws in the script includes:1.  Judi Densch has been deprived of an opportunity to truly shine - I was so looking forward to her rendition of Lady Catherine, which I have no doubt could have been exceptional.  The script eliminated Lady C's best line ("" I am most seriously displeased""), and pretty well hacked out the entire character.  This was a HUGE disappointment.2.  Mr. Bennet, as written, is more of a soft, whipped character, instead of the sharp, although disappointed in marriage, character that Jane created.  Why change the brilliant line in response to Mrs. Bennet's news about netherfield - ""You wish to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it"", to ""You wish to tell me, so I suppose I have no choice"".  Seems subtle, but this changes the flavor of the character.  And the tears at the end when Lizzie accepts Mr. Darcy seemed completely foreign to the character I knew from the book.3.  Wasted opportunities for character development.  I know that when trying to make a 2hour movie from a novel, that certain subplots must be sacrificed, so I was able to live with the elimination of Mr & Mrs Hurst from the story.  However, when every minute is a premium, why, after Elizabeth hears about Charlotte's engagement, are we subjected to a large chunk of time watching Elizabeth swinging?  That time could have been far better spent.  Also there was a wasted scene at the Netherfield ball showing Mr. Bennet consoling Mary after having asked her to stop playing.  Hello - you're trying to CUT story, not ADD to it.4.  Mr Bingley, in this rendition, is not someone you can see Jane Bennet really falling in love with - the character is rather soft-brained, instead of good-natured.  Again, the scene at the end that is ADDED from the story, showing Darcy helping Bingley to prepare to propose to Jane, very much diminishes his character.  Wasted film time that could have been employed far more profitably.5.  The whole handling of Charlotte's engagement was ham-handed.  Why cut a classic line, when Jane says to Elizabeth, ""Lizzie, you are not accounting for differences in situation and temperament"", as Elizabeth tries to reconcile herself to the news.  Instead, we are treated to an out-of-character tirade by Charlotte, with the breathtakingly inappropriate climax of ""Don't you dare judge me, Lizzie"".  *sigh*I don't think of myself as a purist who objects to any changes in the story in order to adapt it.  It's just that with very little effort, this film could have been far superior, and that is what I find the most disappointing."	1.0	Rent - do NOT buy - this rendition	2007-02-13	147	110	37

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2TU3RO6244TZ2	Stargazer	"I was surprised when this version of Jane Austen's masterpiece was released - after the magnificent BBC mini series, I really didn't think that anyone would try and match the unmatchable so soon.However, as this is supposed to be a review of this latest version of Pride And Prejudice I'd better get on with it. Keira Knightley is mesmerizing as Eliza Bennett and I look forward to seeing a lot more of her work in the future.I also loved Matthew McFayden as Mr Darcy,Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennett, and Rosamund Pike captured the very essence of Jane Bennett, the eldest of the Bennett daughters.Dame Judi Dench gave a good performance as the interfering Lady Catherine De Bourg but Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet left me wondering at both his characterization - dirty unkempt hair and slovenly appearance - and how this portrayal in any way came even close to the witty,intelligent and amusing Mr Bennett of Jane Austens creation.At present, Director Joe Wright has teamed up again with Keira Knightley and Belinda Blethyn to make Atonement and I hope his ability to transfer a fine novel to the screen is more successful this time around.Pride and Predujice is so perfectly written, so precisely mapped out by Miss Austen, that any change is noticeable and the changes in story line are NEVER an improvement on the original.The wonder of classics like the books of Austen,the Bronte sisters, Thomas Hardy, George Elliot,is that they teach one about the lives of people in another century, the houses,the customs,the language, the fashion of the day and so forth.So efforts to update or ""modernise"" should be kept to a minimum.I enjoyed the latest P&P; version, but as a film, not as an adaptation of Jane Austens finest work."	3.0	Keira Knightly - Captivating as Eliza Bennett.	2007-02-01	8	5	3

That said, I LOVE this movie! The cinematography is beautiful, and the essence of the book is completely maintained in this particular adaptation. My one critique would be that the accents can be difficult to understand at times (and this comes from a girl who studied in London).

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2R5DBI1RU05M6	"Stephanie Golub ""Stargaziey"""	"I quite enjoyed this adaptation of Pride & Prejudice.  It keeps much of the main plot & key points from the novel & sprinkles in a few more overly romantic scenes.  Only necessary to make the story seem more romantic for the majority of the populace who are not familiar with the decorum of the 19th century.While Keira Knightly looks the part of Elizabeth, something in her performance niggles at me & I'm just not convinced with her.  However, I'm very satisfied with the rest of the cast, most of all Mr. Darcy.  In fact, it's Matthew Macfadyen's performance that just pulled me into this movie.  I actually makes me wish, in this case, the story was told from his POV & not Elizabeth's.There are several instances where we have these ""introspective"" moments with Elizabeth's character, but as we don't hear any narration or speaking on screen, just music, we're left in the dark on what exactly she's thinking.  We have an idea, since we know what is going on in the story, but really we can only speculate.  Some of these are fine in places, but others just seem a bit pointless & could have been left out.  Especially if the time could have been used to keep in any left out portions of the book.I do love the original story & while this movie isn't the truest version it certainly looks beautiful & has a pretty solid cast.  Some folks may find the movie slow or boring, but not every movie needs explosions to be good.  No, I'd say most anyone who is a fan of the novel or is curious as to what they may find within it's pages will be pleased with this movie."	4.0	Good adaptaion with a solid cast	2010-03-09	2	2	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3J3AKELO8I207	"Stephen C. Jordan ""virginia reader"""	"I resisted seeing this movie for a long time, thinking who needs another P&P;?  It's been done many times, and quite well (BBC miniseries and the Greer Garson, Laurence Olivier versions stand out).  Cynically, I thought this is just another Hollywood grab for some sure dollars.However, I found this version to be refreshing and inspired.  Many people have commented on the youthfulness of the characters, the transposition to more rural as opposed to drawing room settings, and the more unrestrained atmosphere, as opposed to the buttoned-up proto-Victorian image of versions past.However, what I liked about it, was that it had a very clear grasp of the central relationship between Darcy and Lizzy, from the first attractions of their mutual chemistry, to the unfolding and appreciation of their respective characters.  In other hands, the attraction between the two would have been unfathomable, particularly where the dialogue is harsh, but Keira Knightley does a great job conveying the conflict between her head and heart, and the scenes between the two lovers are charged with enough emotion to thrill the heart of any romantic.Because of the intense focus on the central relationship, the other characters sort of fade into the background, and I don't think Mr. or Mrs. Bennett are done as well as in some other versions.  However, Collins and ""his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourg"" are done very well, and the last interview between Lizzie and Lady Catherine is re-cast very well, and is more coherent.In other words, I think this wasn't just made to make a buck, but made from a sense of trying to draw out some of the themes and relationships and show the characters in a fresh light.I was enchanted.

The girl I took was a huge Jane Austen fan, but I never was.  My parents love the A&E version, but I never could get through it.  I went in with the same expectation and was completely wrong.  Keira Knightly's performance is her best to date.  If she doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination, something is wrong.  The film is bright, cheerful, and funny.  The supporting cast is wonderful, but Rosamund Pike and Donald Sutherland stand out.  Guys, don't worry.  I usually hate chick flicks too, but this is one that guys could handle taking dates to.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AGRR05FH945HR	Steven Cain	I think not. Nor, is he in fact, dead. I loved his masterful portrayal of Darcy, as I have loved everything he does, including Love Actually, but it did not prevent me from devouring this gorgeous adaptation.To me, Knightley was a revelation, and this beautifully crafted adaptation is a showcase for her genuine versatility. When you can hold your own against a goddess of stage and screen such as Dame Judi Dench, you've got something going on. Likewise, in her beautiful interaction with a superb Donald Sutherland, when she is speaking to him about Darcy's marriage proposal. Both actors are just stunning.I love this version equally with the Colin Version, and everything from the cinematography to the casting, production and direction all conspire to make this movie a delight for the senses. Being a fan of solo piano, I also loved the soundtrack (Dario Marianelli), especially the exquisite cascading ripples of pieces such as Liz On Top Of The World.At the heart of this delicious interpretation is Austen's disturbing portrayal of the sheer madness of a blinkered patriarchal society in which females, even brilliant, beautiful and gifted females, could never inherit property. Brenda Blethyn's delightful performance as a mother anxious to get her divine daughters married off, is based on this shameful reality.Even though I had heard many good things about the Knightley Version, it actually exceeded my expectations by a quantum factor, and I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.	5.0	Colin Firth... rolling in his grave?	2006-10-02	11	6	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2KVUYPLEW4LXT	"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time"""	"I am not worthy of writing a review of this film, but I MUST try.It seems like only yesterday Codemaster Talon (my genius sister and fellow Amazon reviewer) and myself were sitting in a darkened theater watching previews before some film or other, and saw a fleeting glimpse of yet another Jane Austin inspired film. That was my initial reaction, ""Oh no, not ANOTHER one..."". And yet, within that short time I was intrigued. The acting looking competent, and the cinematography absolutely breath-taking. ""I'll see it for the cinematography alone,"" I commented to my companion.Now I don't pretend to be half the Jane Austin fan that Codemaster Talon is. I don't pretend to be some kind of literary higher critic or the absolute authority on historical accuracy and proper period acting. I do however, know a good story when I see one. Pride and Prejudice as a story in all it's versions holds a very special place in my heart. You see at it's core it is the story of two very similar personality types who are monstrously incompatible on the surface, and perfect compliments deep down.Elizabeth Bennet is an introvert who acts the extrovert, a whimsical person who is practical deep down, a genius who cares more about her friends' happiness than impressing others, and wishes for true love more than riches. She's a young woman who uses her feelings to deal with the world but most treasures her intuition. Darcy is a person who has all his feelings buried deep down. He's an introvert who keeps to himself unless compelled to action. He's logical and analytical, but treasures his feelings above all. He's blunt with his feelings, because so few people understand them. He's arrogant and proud, but courageous, and noble. In short he's the exact opposite of Elizabeth in every way save one. They are both people who live in their own universe separate from the rest of the world. And they are both VERY stubborn and judgmental.I've seen the old version of this story with Sir Laurence Olivier as Darcy and Greer Garson as Elizabeth. I've seen the gold-standard A&E; version which caused such an uproar with it's amazing dialog and acting. I have never seen anything like this. Never before has the true heart and soul of Liz and Darcy been on display. Never before could I see clearly expressed WHY  they fell in love with each other. In fact, never before could I see a real sign that they HAD fallen in love with each other. Now I see it.A movie is more than just acting with some music and sound effects tossed in, captured through a hand-held camera (despite what Indy film buffs may have told you). A real movie uses the acting to further the dialog, the dialog to further the action, the music to further the moment captured by the lens. Everything pushes  to express feelings and emotions that grab a hold of you and don't let go. I mentioned that the preview for this movie intrigued me because of the cinematography, but I had NO IDEA what was yet to come.Painting with Color, Drawing with LightThe title of this movie appears in a ray of sunlight. The first few minutes take us inside of the Bennet house with a genius that reminded me of the camera-work of The Magnificent Ambersons' greatest shot. And it only gets better. This is not showy camera-work for it's own sake. Everything has a point in this movie. Those opening minutes told multiple stories at once. Those first time I saw this movie beginning made me think first of the  standing of the household (as the lived-in and somewhat decayed nature of the estate was quite apparent), then of the personality of the main character (carrying a book and inside her own world despite all the hustle and bustle around her), and then of the personality of everyone else inside the house, as each person's body language, voice and activity summarized their personality in a snapshot.As the film progressed I witnessed a country party quite unlike anything I've seen in a Jane Austin film before. The party was lively and ecstatic and looked like FUN. And when Darcy and his friend came to the party we could quite quickly see how everyone else was a country bumpkin compared to them (something that was never so clear to me before). More than that, again the use of camera angles and body language spoke beyond the dialog to hint at things unsaid. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""This movie is going to be interesting."" Then came the first scene where I honestly was mentally agasp with the question ""How did they do that?"". Liz and Jane are having a sister-to-sister conversation under the bed covers late at night and the perspective of the camera is the the arm of one sister, then it switches back to the other sister's perspective. ""Where's the camera?"", was all I could think. Not good camera use, GREAT.There were three moments in this film that  took my breath away (and while it was certainly impressive and added enormously to the picture, the dance between Darcy and Elizabeth where everyone else disappears {an effect executed marvelously here} is not one of them). The moments were these:The ProposalFirstly, Darcy's famous proposal. Normally portrayed somewhat arrogantly on Darcy's part, here it is played with passion, and we can see his heartache. Nay, we can FEEL his heartache. The whole scene happens in the rain, outdoors, with Liz and Darcy starting somewhat apart, and, as he proposes and she rejects him with more and more fury, they gradually get closer and closer until by the end of the scene their faces are nearly touching. I could FEEL the magnetism between the characters. I could SEE for the first time, that it was not HIM that she was rejecting (though she thought she was) but his ACTIONS. Despite her words, she was clearly drawn to him, absorbed in his personality. Though for so long she acted indifferent toward him, seemingly not caring, she was in fact almost obsessed with him. Yeah, I got all that from one scene.On top of the WorldOkay, this was it, the moment when I knew that I didn't just like this movie, I had fallen head-over-heels-in-love! While there are many splendid moments of wide-screen wide-angle shots (YES!), and some super-nice super-close-ups (the beauty is almost too much for my eyes!), this scene truly takes the cake. It starts with Lizzy in a carriage, the camera  on her eyes as sunlight and shadow dance across them. Then, the camera cuts to a STUNNING  shot of Elizabeth standing at the edge of a cliff with the wind blowing against her. The music swells and... GOODNESS. I'm glad I have ears and eyes and life within me to witness spectacles like this.Your Hands Are Cold.I've always loved Darcy as a character, for the same reason I loved Colonel Brandon in Sense and Sensibility. To me he's always been a hero, a great man just waiting for a chance to prove his strength and courage. This is perhaps the most powerful scene of the movie. After a terrible confrontation with the Lady Catherine, Lizzy gets up early in the cold morning and walks out into the hills. Just as the sun is coming up, who appears but Darcy, walking up with his jacket billowing in the wind like a hero's cape, sad, noble, and with depth of emotion to bring you to tears. It's like a hero coming back from a war. As he and Lizzy talk, they draw close together just as the sun is coming up between the two of them. That's what I live for. It's a moment that's so romantic and larger than life that it belongs alongside the greatest from Gone With the Wind and Casablanca. I don't know what else to say.The FilmWhat can I say about the acting of this film? For the first time in ages I forgot I was watching ACTORS and felt like I was watching a story unfold in front of me. I haven't felt this way since I was a kid. I forgot anyone was acting. For the most part, the characters in the film simply WERE. In other words, I smell Academy Awards.Knightley's Elizabeth is sharp, sensitive, sweet, and strong, a fully fleshed out acting job that simply makes us believe she IS the character. Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy is so sincere, so from the heart, that we cannot for one moment doubt his sincerity. He brings new depth to a new interpretation of a classic character. Rosamund Pike's Jane is simply overflowing with sweetness and good nature (and the scene of her leaving to pursue her love in the back of a carriage is feminine beauty personified). Even the so often portrayed as unbearably oily Mr. Collins gets a new spin as played by Tom Hollander. I actually felt SORRY for the guy a few times (trapped as he is in his own ridiculous world and never realizing how absolutely pathetic and silly he seems). Also wonderfully done are the Bennet parents played by Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland. Mrs. Bennet comes across more as a misunderstood sweet parent than a hyper-annoying flibbertigibbet. And Mr. Bennet just has more emotional resonance than in any previous version I've ever seen. Just about everyone is perfectly played in this movie.The music is sparing, but used to great effect. Never overwhelming the action, but rather pushing it, the soundtrack is quite good (I have it). There are moments of supreme beauty to be heard, but on the whole the soundtrack is rather sparse (comes to little more than half an hour).Some reviewers on the Net said that this production was by-the-numbers. I can understand that...if you happen to be color-blind, tone-deaf, and wouldn't know a good script if it smacked you upside the head. This film deserves to sweep the Oscars in every category. So perfect is the camera-work ( I have seen nothing like it since the days of Ford, Cardiff and Kurosawa), the score (heart-breaking), the acting (I love ALL the characters), and the script (it reaches straight into your heart) that EVERYONE should enjoy this film. Like the story that inspired it, it is a perfect marriage of the Male and Female personalities combining the Epic feel and strength of a man's film with the delicacy, beauty, and wit of a woman's film. I had thought long ago that the two great miracles of film-making would be to make the ordinary seem Epic, or the Epic seem ordinary. This film makes the ordinary, the lives and loves of people, into something as Epic as the end of the world or the blazing of new frontiers. I for one shall never be the same. After seeing this film I look at the world in a different way, and perhaps always shall.If this movie has one major flaw it is this: it is FAR too short at 2 hours. This is simply too big a story with too many characters to tell in that short a time. As such a lot of things things had to be spelled-out, and entire scenes and characters got the chopping block. And another reason I wish it were longer: I enjoyed every moment of this film so much I never wanted it to end.  My first words at as the end credits rolled were something like ""I can't wait for the director's cut."" You could wait for it to come out on DVD, but then you'd have to buy a big-screen TV and a surround-sound system to experience it's full glory.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A396DYUXNX08MA	"Suemc.Sydney. ""Austen Fan"""	Having been a fan of Jane Austen's literature since first studying it during my school years, and having just about every filmed adaption of her novels in my collection, I awaited this version with high expectations.  To my mind, it is both good and bad in about equal proportions.Good from the cinematography angle, with the scenery and beautiful,gracious homes used being quite extraordinary.  Bad from the point that much of the language and intent of the book is lost, when the storyline is condensed down to such a short time.  When you choose to make a movie of a book, especially one so well loved as P&P;,I really think that you have a duty of care to hold the book close and stay true to it, not change things to suit your whim.I do believe that this movie was aimed at an audience who have a short attention span, and those who have never read Jane Austen's books.  Who else but the American market would expect a specially made soppy ending (which fortunately is an 'added extra' here) and would willingly accept so many omissions and deleted characters that causes much of the point of Austen's writings to be entirely lost.  For instance, there is no explanation of how Mr Collins came to propose to Charlotte Lucas - she just appears out of the blue and makes the announcement.And Lady Catherine arriving at the Bennet home in the middle of the night - no way, and it's not in the book.Mr Darcy's initial proposal in the rain, not in the Collins' house as should have been, was rushed and muddled.And he just walked straight into the house in the middle of the night to deliver his letter? Hardly - he was waiting in the woods for Lizzie who walked there.Did anyone else notice that when Lizzie first goes to Pemberley and comes across Georgiana playing the piano, that there is a mirror above her as she plays, and yet when LiZzie and the Gardiners arrive next day, Mr Darcy is standing in front of the piano underneath that superb painting on the wall of the other room?  ?Continuity?With regard to the actors chosen, they are for the most part extremely good, although I did not like the choice of Donald Sutherland for Mr Bennett at all.  Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennett, the indomitable Dame Judy Dench as Lady Catherine,and the luminous Rosamund Pike joining Tom Hollander again following their roles in the BBC series of 'Wives and Daughters', were quite outstanding.  Keira Knightley glows as Lizzie, although sometimes I found her a little lightweight,and Matthew Macfadyen (well known in Australia from his starring role in the TVseries 'Spooks') speaks volumes with just one look, and broods stylishly, although the racing speed with which he delivers his proposal was most unfortunate.While this version of Pride & Prejudice has scenery and music to enrich your senses, I will continue to prefer the A&E; version with Ehle & Firth, however the BBC version with Garvie & Rintoul remains the closest word for word capturing of Jane Austen's writings.Not a bad attempt, but should have been much better.	3.0	Close - but should have been better.	2006-10-30	15	9	6

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A428QH7DO01T4	Susan J Endreshak	I was sort of off put with this adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  I never thought I would watch a screen play of Pride and Prejudice where Lizzie grows up in a pig farm.  Having grown up south of a good ol' Iowa pig farm, I find it very hard to believe that aristocrats could overcome the odors long enough to propose marriage.  I was also surpised to discover the Bennet family living in what looked like a very large city dumpster.  And last, but hardly least, I was very distracted in the second marriage proposal scene, by poor Matthew Macfadyen's bushy eyebrows appearing very assymetrical.  Although, granted, the director might have been making a plot point with Darcy's uneven, bushy eyebrows, as early on, in Miss Jane Austen's novel, Mr. Darcy notes Elizabeth's failures of perfect symmetry of form.  I don't know though.  Also, I did not care for Donald Sutherland's lisping and simpering.	2.0	Rather odd interpretation of Pride and Prejudice	2013-03-07	2	1	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3KTVKVXJW1080	Susan Schultz	This movie was certainly an adaptation.  The characters were not as I envisioned in my head when I read Jane Austen's novel.  I think that because so much was cut it was hard to see how characters developed so quickly.  Some of the actors were downright obnoxious.  I have not seen the A&E version yet but I think I would have preferreed it over this one.  Although this review seems harsh, I think it is a decent movie for someone who has not read the book first.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1MRQUGR3IXV7T	Susan Smith	I'm another devotee of the 1995 BBC production of P&P; but I looked forward to this very much.  I accept that this shorter version can only hope to catch the flavour of Austen's work and I never expected that it would follow the novel slavishly.  However, here is what I liked and did not like:I liked most of the production values - the settings were wonderful and it was great that Chatsworth House was used for Pemberley.  The costumes and hairdressing were good:  not at all artificial and probably very much portrayed life in the 1790s (when the novel was actually written) - people sweat, the ladies' hairdos come undone.  The assembly and ballroom dancing scenes were well done and the room they were set in was wonderful.  The photography was excellent and the music charming.  There were some continuity errors, however, that are pretty annoying; others here have pointed them out.I did not like:  Matthew MacFayden came across as shy and immature rather than proud and the master of a huge and wealthy landed estate.  He just did not ring true; he seemed to be floundering around in both his own and Elizabeth's worlds.  Mr Bingley, Simon Woods, came across as androgenous to me - in fact I wondered if he was a cross dresser at times.  He was so annoying - I just could not see how the local belle, Jane, could find him even remotely attractive.  Yuck! And, finally, Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett:  No, No, No, No, No, No.  The casting, probably a sop to the US audience, was completely ridiculous.  And the scruffy beard????  I think Austen meant him to be a little more refined and sophisticated than the gentleman farmer we see chasing pigs through the kitchen.Silliness:  A complete waste of Dame Judi Dench.  What was Lady Catherine doing visiting the Bennetts in the middle of the night?Nonetheless, it's still P&P; and worth watching although I think I need to revive myself with the Firth/Ehle version again before I view this once more.	3.0	Disappointing	2006-06-06	10	3	7

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ACXTTDH5WKZ1P	Suzanne	I've hesitated on reviewing this for several years now even though I've owned the dvd since its release. I guess I wanted to give it couple attempts to change my mind. Unfortunately, I still feel the same way about this adaptation. It's still the most deplorable adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I've seen even though I really wanted to like it. There are just too many things that were done incorrectly in this adaptation including casting, wardrobe, dialogue, etiquette, and so on. There were too many cringe-inducing scenes and dialogue to allow me the luxury of enjoying it.While I like Keira Knightley as an actress, her portrayal of Elizabeth was simply wrong. Her Elizabeth erred more on the side of petulant rather than witty. I won't even talk about some of the things that her Elizabeth said and did that Jane Austen's Elizabeth would never say and do because they would be considered improper. I also had a problem understanding Keira Knightley. She spoke her lines way too fast and I was often forced to use the subtitles to understand what she was saying. The rest of the cast I easily understood. I also like Matthew MacFayden. I've seen him in Little Dorrit and The Way We Live Now. However, his portrayal of Mr. Darcy was far too timid. There was nothing confident or supercilious about his attitude; he was therefore unconvincing. The only character portrayal that I liked was Rosamund Pike's Jane. The rest also missed the mark for me.Overall, I was really looking forward to this adaptation when I heard a new Pride and Prejudice was coming out. Unfortunately, this just didn't cut it.	1.0	Just Doesn't Cut It	2009-11-29	14	10	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A34LKP9WZ065EU	Sweetjane	As many people here have said, Jane Austen's wonderful book is one of my favorites. I haven't seen the Colin Firth mini-series, but I have seen and loved the great BBC version. One problem here is that people are comparing the two five hour (approximately) mini-series with the two hour movie. Necessarily things are going to be left out of the movie. Naturally the character development has to be shortened. No one is going to sit in a movie theater for five hours. I think the story came across intact considering the time alotted.The way I see it P&P; 2005 is a modern version complete with modern cinematography, modern actors and a beautiful, lush soundtrack. I thought the actors did a fine job, especially the very expressive Darcy. I agree that the Bingley character was a little goofy, but I thought that made him endearing. Elizabeth was smart and independent and I enjoyed the rowdiness of her family. I realize that these same traits bothered other people, but they give this version it's own style. Those who want to know more about Austen's satirical look at society can pick up the book.I think the most important review on these pages was the one from a woman with no prior interest in Austen, who happened to catch the movie on a plane flight. She was delighted and went home and bought the book, read it and saw both of the mini-series. A fan is born and that, to me, is the important thing here. If this movie brings more people into the Jane Austen fold, more power to it. On the other hand, if people see it and that's the only exposure to Jane Austen they get, I'm sure they will get along just fine.I must add that I resent people saying it was dumbed down for American tastes. Isn't it possible to write a review without insulting a whole nation?	5.0	It's a movie, not a mini-series	2006-03-25	14	9	5

I found this adaptation very disappointing and at times corny because this movie does not capture the true spirit of the book (""light and frothy"") and the sharp and irresistable wit of Jane Austen. I wonder what Jane Austen would have thought of the closing scene (no such corny provision made in the book) where Mr. Darcy plants several kisses on Mrs. Darcy while calling her Mrs. Darcy each time.  One such kiss would have been tolerable, I suppose.Moreover, Mathew McFayden's portrayal of Mr. Darcy is quite disturbing because Jane Austen did not intend Darcy to be shy or unsure of himself or wooden or awkward.  Rather, Darcy is supposed to be a little over-confident, arrogant and uncomfortable to be out of his environment and among peasants (at the beginning of the book).  Keira Knightly's acting fares no better.  She did not do justice to the most beloved character of English literature, Elizabeth Bennet who is witty, feisty, vivacious but never forward or desparate.  Nowhere in the book, she asks Darcy if he likes to dance or kissed or would have kissed Darcy's hand, etc.  In addtion, several of the main characters are miscast, notably Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins, Charlotte Lucas.The best, and truest, adaptation of Pride & Prejudice is still the 1995 BBC production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth with excellent cast, no deviation from the witty sparkling spirit of Jane Austen, and with a perfect Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy."	3.0	Disappointing	2005-11-27	25	16	9
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3MF2WD96HMPD1	"Tally ""Tally"""	There's two ways you're going to approach this movie. Your options are:1. I want to watch a fun romantic movie that happens to take place in 1800 England.2. I want to watch a faithful production of a Jane Austen book.If you approached the movie from the first criteria you probably enjoyed it. If you approached it from the second criteria, you probably didn't enjoy it.I have no arguments against the movie as a romantic comedy. It's fun to watch, there's enough sparks to keep you interested and it ends well. What more do you need?But if you're looking for a faithful adaptation of not only Austen's book but an accurate portrayal of the lives of the landed gentry of the time, you probably found yourself annoyed, even angry and disgusted.I've read through several pages of reviews on this movie and there seems to be two common themes regarding the accuracy of the movie's setting.1. Some people thought it was more realistic than the 1995 product but I beg to differ. The Bennets were not farmers. They were not gentlemen farmers. They were landed gentry. The landed gentry lived on estates that comprised of tenanted farms rented out and the family lived off the income. They did not directly engage in farming. The concept that there would be livestock, including pigs, wandering through the manor house is ridiculous, if only because regular farmers certainly didn't let livestock run through their houses either! In the book Mr. Bennet spent his time shooting, reading and drinking wine. Mrs. Bennet boasted about the servants they had and that the girls never needed to cook or clean. They were the idle rich, if not as rich as Darcy or the Bingleys. The Bennets had an income of 2,000 pounds a year at a time when the typical laborer's income was 25 pounds a year. Think about that very carefully before deciding that the relatively impoverished portrayal of the family in this film was historically accurate.2. People liked this movie better because there was more emotion involved between the main characters. I can see where this is coming from. Certainly compared to the 1995 production Darcy and Elizabeth are more physically emotional and one sees more &#34;sparks&#34;. That's fine. It's fun to watch. Then again it's not necessarily historically accurate either. Judging the behavior and attitude of characters from 1800 by 2005 standards is wholly misleading. The British upper classes to which the Bennets and the Darcys belonged prided themselves on a very strict set of rules governing public behavior and social conduct, after all they gave birth to the entire concept of the &#34;stiff upper lips.&#34; Elizabeth Bennet would not have shouted at Darcy as she did in this movie, to do so would be a sign of bad breeding and bad behavior, which she went great pains to avoid because other members of her family were already badly behaved. Jane Austen makes clear that characters who were too publicly emotional and who couldn't constrain themselves with proper decorum were looked down upon or suffered badly - such as Mrs. Bennet who is held in contempt or Lydia who's a ridiculous character deserving little sympathy and whose behavior almost ruined her sisters' chances for a good marriage. It may be difficult for a modern audience to struggle with this concept but the rules governing behavior in 1800 England was very different from today and very strict by modern day standards. If a real family like the Bennets as portrayed in this film were around in 1800 England, they'd have been shunned and despised by their neighborhoods much as we might look down on &#34;trashy&#34; people for loud, vulgar and coarse behavior, lack of neatness of dress or unshaven faces.On the whole it was a fun and entertaining movie to watch if you didn't take it too seriously. It's still too &#34;2005&#34; as too many modern influences from behavior to hair styles and even clothes crept into the film to make it realistically accurate. The 1995 production is so accurate that it's become timeless - you really can't tell if it was made in 1975 or 1985 or 2005 or today.	3.0	Depends on what you're looking for	2006-04-15	0	0	0

This is just, ""Rich man falls in love with poor woman."" Obviously the star is Knightley but in the original BBC movie (still the best) and the book it is both Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The lines were so fast here it was like having a finger on the fast forward. The Bennet's were not so poor that they had pigs in their living room; they were upper middle class so this version is just an ""updated"" fast forward through Cinderella-type story lines. Key lines were said so quickly there was little enjoyment. Better to read the book or - still better - go get the 1995 version with Ehle and Firth.

The story seems to drag on for an eternity and I lose interest long before the book concludes.  My sister made me watch the movie, promising it was better.  I was very skeptical.  But, I now have to admit that I loved the movie!  It cut out all the long, boring scenes the book tended to dwell on.  The acting was great and the story was beautiful.  There are still some cheesy lines and a little bit of corniness, but it's a chic-flick.  That's to be expected!	5.0	Better than the book!	2007-08-12	11	2	9

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2UMXB4NL78W96	Tara	I might be the very last hopeless romantic to lay eyes on this movie, but just in case I'm not, let me tell you how much I LOVED it.  I just got done watching it on DVD and I can honestly say I loved every minute of it.  All throughout this movie, you get to see how people must have acted back in that time.  All the women curtsey to everyone they meet and people are just formal in general.  The landscape of this movie was beautiful.  There were also very slight, but very funny little moments between the sisters, the mother, the father and the upper class of this movie.  I started out not even liking the main male character in this movie, and ended up loving him at the end.  It's like you were able to witness Lizzie and Mr. Dausey fall in love, every step of the way.  This movie made me laugh and cry and want it to never end.  It was one of the most romantic movies I have ever seen.  If you're a woman and you haven't seen this movie yet - you better get your butt to a movie rental store and rent it right away!	5.0	One of the MOST romantic movies I've ever seen!	2006-05-20	16	12	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2A2SUY3IOQKY1	TawnTawn	Read the book, didn't like it, why would I like the movie? The story of a family whose English countryside home and property must pass to the next male heir, just rubs me the wrong way.  There are five daughters in the family, and the mother's goal is to get them all married off advantageously (in case her husband drops dead and they are all kicked out).  I don't remember all the chickens, pigs and goats being all around the house, nor the wash hung on the line. Of course none of the girls, mother or father had to do a lick of work, they had servants for that...the father thanked one of them once for serving the food.  One maid hums as she passes out the clean laundry, so we're supposed to infer that as servants, they were content with their lot in life.Kiera Knightly plays Lizzie Bennet, who is supposed to be not very attractive, but very intelligent and witty. This is not convincing.  Ms. Knightly displayed a disturbing habit of wrinkling her nose and baring her overlapping incisors at the camera at almost every opportunity. In fact, I think her teeth should have gotten second billing.The rest of the story is basically the same as the novel and all following Harlequin romance stories - distant man, girl can't stand him, learns more about him, falls in love (especially when she sees his house), he falls in love with her, oh happy happy joy joy. The mother gets to brag on daughters, keep house, keep servants. Absolutely no contribution to society is necessary. Get what you can, survival is everything.	2.0	I Just Don't Like This Story	2005-12-07	20	3	17

And I have seen, I believe every version of P&P that's out there (including the 1930's version and the Bollywood-like 'Bride and Prejudice'. While I love the BBC miniseries version, this one to me, goes in tone and feeling where I don't think BBC had the scope for. I saw this movie not 1,2,3 but 4 times in the theatre. I never got tired of it, but i stopped going because the theatre staff were starting to recognize me on site. This movie is now in the top 5 of my all-time genre-crossing films. I was moved every time I saw it, no matter how the audience was, or who I was when I was watching it. If you haven't seen it, go buy it, because renting it will only cost you more in the end, after you rent it for the fifth time.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3D4O8EEA1J3MJ	"teachingmom ""teachingmom"""	This version of Pride and Prejudice is what got me to pick up Austen's book in the first place.  Since then I have watched the BBC version a number of times and rewatched this version countless others.  I have come to the conclusion that a blend of the two would be perfect, but since that won't happen this is my first choice.  There is no correct or incorrect way to interpret literature so there can be no correct or incorrect way to produce a film based on Austen's book.This version is my favorite because it was able to create a chemistry between the characters which, from my viewing, is completely missing in the BBC version.  Again, that was my interpretation of it.  Don't not view/buy this movie because reviews criticize its lack of authenticity.  If you want complete authenticity read the book.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1E7QUM8DG0D16	Teresa Medeiros	It's so rare to find a satisfying romance at the movies that I nearly dissolved into raptures of delight to discover not one but two of them this weekend! On Friday I had the distinct pleasure of going to see the new theatrical version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE with Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen. To be honest, I was prepared to be disappointed. I had seen the rather murky looking trailer that made even the gorgeous Keira Knightly look washed-out and blotchy. Plus as we all know, every version of P & P must now be compared to that platinum standard of the 1995 BBC mini-series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.But I found the new movie to be thoroughly delightful and exhilarating! At just a little over 2 hours long, it couldn't cover quite as much ground as the mini-series (Wickham and the two younger sisters had very minor roles), but it beautifully captured the romance and robust good humor of Austen's story. I was caught off guard by several laugh-out-loud moments.Keira Knightly embodied Elizabeth Bennet's intelligence and wit. (Her portrayal also reminded me a little of Jo March in LITTLE WOMEN.) One glimpse of her smile and you knew why Darcy's heart was captivated. MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy won me over in the moment when I realized his voice had the exact same timbre as Alan Rickman's. The murkier cinematography actually ended up making the movie seem more vital and historically accurate. The gritty images of daily life are contrasted with breathtaking shots of the English countryside, including one of Mr. Darcy striding out of the mist that almost rivals Colin Firth's rising up out of Pemberly's pond on the female gasp of appreciation scale.

That cinematography!The lighting was very pretty, although whenever the characters in the movie would take a stroll in town, you could tell that the ""town"" was a set.And why did Elizabeth (Keira Knightly--no, I'm not confusing it with Elizabeth in ""Pirates"") stand on the edge of that cliff in the first place?  Why did she wish to be there?  Was she dreaming?  If not, where in the world was she?  How did she get there?  How long did it take her to get home?  What's the point in having that in the movie, seeing as it made no sense?Altogether, this movie was just so-so.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AKOMVTIW0624J	"Theresa Griffith ""Unrepentant book junkie"""	I can still remember being 18 and watching the BBC mini-series for the first time. The chemistry between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth was breath-taking. Over the years I have worn out one VHS set, replaced it with the DVD set, and re-read the book so many times I had to replace it as well. I was excited when I heard that a new version was being made until I actually had the misfortune of watching the adaptation(and I use that term loosely). For anyone aquainted with the mini-series or the book, this version is little more than a sprint through the rich world that Jane Austin created and it does not remain faithful to much of anything.In this world, any man besides a doctor would never enter the sickroom of a lady under anything but the most dire circumstances and that would usually result in an offer of marriage to save her reputation, but Mr. Bingly wanders in without even knocking. A gentleman would not consider venturing downstairs in his own home without a cravet and coat on and yet Mr. Darcy is shown wandering the countryside in little more than a shirt and pants. The language is too modern, Elizabeth is too childish and don't even get me started on the ridiculous scene in which Lady Catherine comes to personally pound on their door in the middle of the night.If your looking for a true adaptation of this amazing classic novel, stick to the mini-series.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A8SROPEDPV13M	thia	"Those reviewers who criticize the imperfect portrayal of the characters, fancying themselves to be pro Jane Austen, need to go back and read the book again to get it right. They missed a lot of things which the movie picks up beautifully. yes, there isn't time for complete character development in a 2 hour movie. yes, some scenes are combined, which wonderfully serves the purpose of retaining the emotion and atmosphere one gets from reading the book. keeping the scenes strictly by the book, and then cutting it down to 2 hours, would give a watered down version of the overall tone. these people who call themselves fans of Jane Austen seem more to be the narrow minded prejudiced snobs that she abhors. The costumes are different styles, because certain people would be able to have the lastest fashions, and others not. There is a lot of reality in this film that many  peple are overlooking, and much of the original dialogue is incorporated. And who cares that Georgiana is a little extroverted?  The BBC version, BTW, didn't stick strictly with the book - they added things that weren't in the book, like the ""most beloved"" lake scene.  (What would Jane think about that?)  I think Jane would appreciate all these versions as compliments to the book's timeless popularity and introducing it to new generations. It's interesting that some parts of the film, while not necessarily in the Austen book, are very similar to scenes from P. Aidan's trilogy about the whole story from Darcy's viewpoint.

Darcy's second take when he first laid eyes on Elizabeth; her nervous giggle after she saw him; the long scene at the dance where Elizabeth went from room to room, and Darcy flowing through one scene, the dance where at the conclusions it was just the two finishing the dance.But the killer scene was their argument in the rain.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"****Aah, Jane Austen. The ""Harry Potter"" of the independent theater chains. Always reliable to pack the theaters. And you can count on a new film based on one of her books every few years.Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) is in a state, her family of five daughters is living on borrowed time. She and her husband Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) live on their current estate as the guests of family members, and it has seen better days. With five growing daughters, she feels it imperative to begin marrying them off, hopefully to rich suitors who can then help provide for Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and the unwed daughters. When word arrives that a nearby estate has been rented by Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), a rich man from London, she becomes anxious that he meet her eldest daughter, Jane (Rosamunde Pike), scheming for them to spend every available moment together. At the local ball, Jane meets Mr. Bingley and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), the second oldest of the Bennet children, meets Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen), Mr. Bingley's friend and guest. Just as Jane and Bingley seem to be headed to the altar, Mr. Bingley leaves the estate causing Jane to become distraught. Elizabeth learns that Darcy may have been responsible and her hatred grows. Yet, every time they meet, Elizabeth finds herself more and more attracted to Darcy. But is the feeling mutual?Just when it seems another film based on a Jane Austen book, especially one already made into a film or miniseries at least six times, not counting the numerous other takes on the same material (""Bride and Prejudice"", a recent example), could be excessive, this version of ""Pride"" pushes the envelope, offering something new.One of the best things this film does is cast more authentic looking people in the lead roles. From Knightley on down, all of the actors have a rougher appearance, which seems entirely appropriate for the time. Some previous film adaptations of Austen's work have cast the most beautiful American (Aaaah- Gwyneth Paltrow - choo!) or British actors in the roles. Every time they appeared on screen, it looked like they just walked out of their make-up trailer. Sure, they looked beautiful, but it isn't believable. ""Pride"" strives for and attains a more accurate depiction.Keira Knightley is very pretty, but she isn't glamorous. Too skinny, which may be the one aspect of her that doesn't fit the period, she otherwise seems like a pretty girl. Her features are not perfect and this helps her seem to be a natural fit for the English countryside. Also, there are many scenes in which she has just come in from a walk, or the girls are laying about reading books, etc., and they don't appear perfectly groomed; hair may be out of place or there may be mud on the hem of their skirt. It works. In one scene, Dame Judi Dench arrives at the Bennet home. Irate, her hair is not perfect, because she has just arrived on horseback. Matthew McFadyen is also very handsome, but he isn't movie star handsome. He isn't as good looking as Colin Firth or Hugh Grant and it seems more appropriate for the role, the setting and the time.Director Joe Wright also does some interesting things with the camera, which may seem strange or obtrusive on paper, but actually make the experience of watching the film more interesting and enjoyable. In one scene, the camera follows Mrs. Bennet through a ball hosted by Mr. Bingley. She passes certain people throughout the filled rooms. When the camera spots one of the Bennet girls, it stops briefly, allowing us to hear their conversation. After we have heard what we need, it picks up and follows another character, past another conversation. Soon, the camera spots Mrs. Bennet again as she finally reaches the outdoor patio for some fresh air. In another, the camera roves across the windows in the Bennet home picking up pieces of conversation in each of the bedrooms, starting with Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. This gives us the feeling we are watching a book come to life, as though we are turning the pages as we read. It is an effective technique, aiding the look and feel of the film.All of the performances in the film are very good. Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen are very believable as the unrequited lovers. Knightley conveys Elizabeth's intelligence, pride and passion, at turns, throughout the film. She is low key, but very interesting. When she initially meets Darcy, she claims her hatred for him and his attitude. Later, as she tells her father she really loves him, he doesn't understand, yet we do. Matthew MacFadyen conveys Darcy's boredom, growing attraction and passion as well. There are more than a few instances when their attraction to one another is palpable, yet because of their misunderstandings, or misconceptions about one another, are unable to act. It seems as though they take shifts; in one scene Elizabeth is in love with him. In others, he loves her. Throughout, reciprocation is prevented by an outside influence of some sort. The final scene is also very romantic.All of the supporting characters are equally believable. Brenda Blethyn is a little over the top, but it works to see her running around, insinuating her daughters into the lives of every eligible bachelor within ten miles. Donald Sutherland is great as the father who is much quieter than his wife, yet he exudes a quiet admiration for his partner. He is also the more level headed member of the family providing calm and serenity to his somewhat overbearing wife. Judi Dench is also memorable as a member of the aristocracy who tries to control the lives of some of the people involved.I don't think we can ask for more in a film adaptation of a book; the characters, their persona, the setting and the feel of the period are all correct creating an engrossing film worthy of any book."	4.0	Yet Another Jane Austen Film?...

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A278FM2WAUBK4G	Thunderofsilence	"The 1995 version of this movie with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehrle was the most beautiful production, filmed b ythe BBC and shown on the A&E; channel. The scenery was luscious, the acting was convincing, and the period of the drama seemed more authentic than this version. Also the cinamentographer had breathtaking views. Also, this 1995 version is light, breezy, and easy comedic drama. I believe this is the movie catapulted Colin Firth's career.  For me, he will always be ""the"" Mr. Darcy.Now, regarding this 2005 remake, for the film has been remade many times, it was a very drab. I love Keira Knightly, and I thought Brenda Bleven played her part well; however, Allison Steadman, who played the mother in the 1995 version, was very irritating but funny too. I didn't like Donald Sutherland portrayal as the father. To me, he seemed somewhat aloof as the father. Of all the sisters, Jena Malone, who portrayed Lydia, was the most miscast as was the actor who played Mr. Collins. If you get the 1995 version, watch how David Bammer who played this role just makes you laugh at his portrayal of this character. In my opinion, the main fault of this movie, along with the casting, should not have been squeezed into two hours. The 1995 version, on two discs, was just over 5 hours.Andrew Davies, the British screenwriter, really caught the nuance of Jane Austin's book. I'm sure this is the movie that help catapult Colin Firth's film career. In my opinion, he's never had a better role even although he's gone on to have been nominated as Best Actor for ""A Single Man"", then later won the Oscar for his role in ""The King's Speech.""  So, please, please see the 1995 A&E; version with Colin Firth, please see it. It is a wonderfully made."	2.0	Boring version. See 1995 version with Colin Firth; It is EXCELLENT!	2010-04-16	5	2	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A6AC8NJED58WH	Timothy Raiven	"At least the 1940 movie had a superb cast (Most notably L. Olivier as Mr. Darcy) while this version has nothing, absolutely nothing to justify it. Cut to bleeding chunks Austen's witty novel appears like a Rosamunde Pilcher novel set in Regency Times. Which brings me to my next point. Regency. People of that standing did not scamper around in sloppy and non-period clothes at the time, esp. not in England! Wrong hairstyles, utterly wrong and garish colours do not stand for ""natural"" but for lousy costumes & make-up and no understanding of the time-period. The most horrid faux pas was what both wore in the kitschy and trashy sunrise scene that subsituted the truly sweet and charming second proposal moment of the novel. They rewrote not only that but cut important things, added useless stuff & dialogue! And the acting? Keira Knightly, for all her looks, was just annoying as Elizabeth. Her giggling wasn't charming but ridiculous, her impertinence with Darcy came off more as petty rudeness than anything else and her lack of elegance, wit & grace was appalling. Lizzy never would let Darcy almost kiss her in the first proposal scene or yell like that while showing her teeth as if to bite him! McFayden neither has the handsome looks nor the mystery & arrogance needed for Darcy. He portrays him as weak, sweet and misunderstoof from the start, yech! It's ""Pride and Prejudice"" not ""Bitchy & Misunderstood""! The beautiful process of Darcy coming around because of love is destoyed completely because of this. We are left with an utterly bland romance, a defanged Jane Austen & P&P; robbed of its wit, charm, fun and true love so that we may see a soapy, second class romance novel movie that is pretty useless.Stick with the BBC Miniseries with the supreme Jennifer Ehle and Mr. Darcy himself: Colin FirthOr even the other BBC Miniseries with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul."	1.0	Even worse than the 1940 fiasco	2006-02-21	72	37	35

The cast seemed picked by Jane Austen herself. If you think Colin Firth is synonymous with Mr. Darcy then Matthew Macfadyen will make you re-think your loyaty.  Mr. Macfadyen has captured Jane Austen's Darcy, not hollywood's Darcy.  Keira Knightley eyes are as fine as Lizzie's.  Donald Sutherland's last scene as Mr. Bennet with Lizzie in his study is perhaps one of the most genuine performances that I have had the joy to watch.  I watched it over and over again.  Rosammund Pike is the perfect, most beautiful Jane- just as Jane Austen wrote she's the most beautiful of the sisters. She embodies Jane's purity and innocence, her endearing qualities shine through.  I have not enjoyed a ""Jane"" yet -til now.  The use of light and darkness, the constant use of black and white the art and sculptures are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. There is a scene at Pemberley in the art gallery.  The staute of the veiled woman took my breath away!  It was just gorgeous.  The timing in the sunrise scenes are a visual dream! Breathtaking locations, views and beautiful music and acting!  Bravo!!!  And to top it all off--the world famous pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet plays all the piano music.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2UXW18915DQFD	T. Nguyen	I hated this version from beginning to end. Keira knightly's jutted out mouth and her fake accent makes me cringe. And Mr Darcy was completely stiff and I agree with one of the reviewers questioning why he was like a brooding Heathcliff. Ugh, although I agree with everyone that the A&E/BBC version was much better  I still don't like the fact that Elizabeth is always portrayed as the prettier sister instead of her sister which is suppose to be the beautiful and sweet one. I might be nit picky but I just find that aspect of the book to make Elizabeth seem more charming and the story more movable that a plain, tom boyish, intelligent girl wins a mysterious, handsome, wealthy man. I so wish James McAvoy agreed to be Mr. Darcy. It would have been much better with him in it and probably win more awards. He was stupendous in Atonement and so was Keira Knightly. Ugh!!!!! What a waste of film.	1.0	Dreadful	2008-05-22	17	8	9
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ALG7QH2L5JL2L	"T. Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series"""	First of all, I enjoyed this version; I really did. What it got right is a more distinct sense of the darker and chaotic side of Jane Austen's worlds. There's a lot of melancholy here, which wasn't rendered in the preceding TV series. The Brits--though this time contaminated by French input, which didn't help at all; it seldom does-can do Austen very well indeed when they put their midns to it. The BBC version of Emma with Kate Beckinsale was so much superior to the boring Paltrow cinema version.Where does this latest production of P&P; fail?The first problem coming to mind is the script. Adaptation is an art all of its own, and while the TV series had time to plot out most of the significant narrative strands of the novel, two hours of film doesn't. Purely from a scripting point of view, significant characterizations--'significant' in the sense that they contributed to the explication and bringing-to-live of the central characters--were far too 'pro forma', almost as if they were thrown in because the writer felt that they needed to. The result was that many of them had no function at all, and cluttered up the action and diffused the narrative focus.The second problem had to do with direction. The first half, with the aid of the muddled script, was confusing, unconvincing and occasionally annoying. I loved the deconstruction of the decorous superficiality that adhered to the TV series, and the occasionally chaotic social occasions; but in the end it got too much, and the interactions of the main characters were lost, instead of, as the director presumably intended, contextualized. Also, the sound was awful. The deliberate toning-down and made-hard-to-hear-above-the-din of individual conversations may have had an element of realism, but the strain of the listener, having to work out just exactly what was being said, didn't help one's becoming engrossed in the tale. The vacuous sisters and mother and their hysterical carry-ons also became annoying and were overdone and for too long.Third problem: Keira Knightley. She's a cool actress, who fits perfectly into King Arthur, Pirates of the Caribbean, Love Actually--but here she was very much miscast. If the producers had had any guts they would have cast the incomparable Rosamund Pike in that role, instead of wasting her in the nearly-invisible part of Jane Bennett. Rosamund was the saving grace among the women of Die Another Day, and here, too, she basically stole the show without even trying hard whenever she appeared, whether she said or did much or, as was the case for the most time, not. Keira, by contrast, needs to act-by-effort since she doesn't as yet have enough depth of personality. Too much 'star' and not enough 'character'; quite unsuitable for this part. She battled her way through it valiantly, and I admire her for that, but it just wasn't 'right' for her. The mis-casting was rivaled only by the casting of Katie Holmes in Batman Begins.Fourth problem: just about all the male characters, except for Donald Sutherland, who can do no wrong. That the film should fade out with a shot of him was an unexpected stroke of genius. I wonder if it was scripted that way or a directorial decision. (I never saw the alternate ending, which I probably would have loathed; so let's go with this one and pretend that the other never was).Having said all these basically negative things, I'd like to finish on a positive note, which is that in the second half, when the 'busy-ness' started to abate, the film actually acquired depth and became quite touching. The final scene between Elizabeth and her father was the crown, and if an ending is what makes a movie, it makes me forgive many other mistakes.But just imagine if, instead of Keira Knightley it had Rosamunde Pike who had been doing that scene with Sutherland. It would have been near-perfection.It was meant to be FOUR stars (I entered five by mistake!) and that solely because of the second half and a great attempt to take the saccharine edge off the movie-incarnations of Austen's novels.Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNA	5.0	Enjoyable but flawed	2006-03-27	8	5	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2817E4ZO8LJ0M	Tom Chatt	"We greatly enjoyed seeing the new adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen's stories are rich romances, featuring strong and spirited women who seem like they won't get the man they deserve, and the men are often not what they seem at first blush (both good and bad), but character always triumphs over class and money in her endings. In this story, protagonists Lizzie Bennett and Mr. Darcy spar engagingly like Beatrice and Benedick until the inevitable reconciliation. Keira Knightly is perfectly cast as the spirited Lizzie, and Matthew MacFadyen is marvelous as the brooding and taciturn Darcy. The story has been very nicely adapted to the screen by big screen newbies director Joe Wright and writer Deborah Moggach (though rumor has it that Emma Thompson had some hand in the dialogue; she is credited on the film with ""special thanks""), in a sensitive handling that focuses on the romance and the character judgments (and mistakes) that people can make. Beautiful shots of English countryside, together with some very subjective camerawork contribute to the story. (One memorable scene: when Lizzie and Mr. Darcy are dancing at a crowded ball, and for a moment we see the scene as Lizzie does, as if they are the only two in the room, providing a nice depth of feeling in contrast to her seemingly aloof repartee.) The cast are all excellent, but especially notable are Donald Sutherland as the loving father Mr. Bennett (who truly wants his daughter to marry for love), Tom Hollander as the mousy and obsequious Mr. Collins, and of course Judi Dench as the imperious Lady Catherine de Bourg. The costumes, settings, and even the blocking (all that courtly bowing) perfectly recreate the texture of the period. The superb 1995 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility was a hard act to follow, but Pride and Prejudice lived up to our great expectations."	4.0	Lives up to high expectations	2006-02-28	6	5	1

In particular, Elisabeth's attraction to the opposite sex is not so much her beauty but the beauty of thought and the ability to engage others with witty verbal exchanges. The fast and intense fireworks between Elisabeth and Darcy have been partially destroyed by the film's script, which assume movie viewers cannot understand or follow their long verbal duels.  It is sad how the new script have cut or shortened these exchanges.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2A0ZT12G34QB1	Toomuchtimeonmyhands	Okay, I am a rabid Frith and BBC fan of the miniseries, but I was very impressed with this adaption and found it refershing in it's grounded, youthful take on the story.For starters, there is a very grounded nature to the presentation of the story. Some Austenites got their knickers into a twist because they thought it made the family and their circumstances too drab looking. But I loved it! The Meryton Assembly basically sets the stage for this grounded approach-the dancing looks a little heavy footed, the girls look sweaty, and you can't help but think that someone needs to open a window cause it looks awfully sweaty! But at the same time,it made the story come alive, like you were a fly on the wall, peeking in on Lizzy and Darcy and the rest of the gang.Lastly, I loved the youthful take on the story. I LOVE Firth and Ehle as the '95 leads. They had this chemistry and sensual tension that was electric! But their take was definitely from a mature standpoint-like the way I'd act now as a 33 year old woman. Whereas Macfadyen and Knightley? Theirs is a more youthful, innocent, first love take that I just took to. Great chemistry, Lizzy's a little less cocksure, Darcy's a bit more unbalanced by this attraction, and it felt right in terms of age and stage of development with the actual characters in the book.Great adaption, brisk storytelling, and a wonderfully irreverent tone by a fun director who knew it was a good idea to knock the pedestal off from under our Lizzy and Darcy, and let them be seen in a more grounded light. And ps-I thought Macfadyen, even though he doesn't have that big of a part, was a great Darcy!	5.0	I'm a Firth/BBC fan, and I still loved it!	2006-01-11	787	698	89

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A4MX5J20DCKDB	TravelMod	With the Colin Firth-Jennifer Ehle BBC version still fresh and available, why anyone thought that making an abridged theatrical version with anachronisms and insipid acting is beyond me. It's illiterate to confuse the srong-willed and unconventional Austen character of Elizabeth Bennet with a modern-day liberated feminist, which she was not and could not have been. The BBC version understood that; this version was silly and superficial, not to mention that there was no chemistry at all between the leading characters. The idea of Mr and Mrs Bennet as a loving couple is completely contrary to the original story. There was no presentation of the absolute necessity for a young woman with little money to have to marry well, and many other essentially interesting plot points were eliminated.  This Mr Darcy isn't haughty and rude, we're supposed to feel sorry for him because he's shy?  Films are different from novels, but if you're going to change the essentials of the story, you might as well update it entirely to the present day, and call it something else, but not Jane Austen's.	1.0	Well, I suppose a little Austen is better than none.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A28MCN2LZPQ2K9	Trotwood Traddles	"I admit it, all right, I liked this movie more than I expected to.  When I first heard that they were making a new version of Pride and Prejudice, I was excited.  Then when I heard that Keira Knightley was playing Elizabeth, I was put out.  Understand, please, that while Knightley is just fine as a pirate-movie chick, I do not believe she has the acting props or even appreciation of the character she is playing (don't take it to heart, Elizabeth Bennett is, you know, the most complex and thoroughly likeable, believable female character in literature.).  She was ok, a little better than I thought she would be, but I did not recognise Lizzy Bennett in her.  Matthew MacFayden I liked more the second time through, but really thought basically the same of him as of Keira Knightley, that he was more a pretty face to put on the screen than a serious competitor for the ""perfect"" Mr. Darcy.Perhaps my favorite part of the movie was Jane Bennett, who is played very well by an actress whose name I don't know, but who loks and acts the part sublimely.  Sometimes it's hard to like Jane in the book, because she's just too perfect, but she makes you realize why it is that everyone likes Jane, and it was a joy to watch her performance.As for the soundtrack, it was very pretty, but I kept on thinking to myself, ""if you're going to sound exactly like Chopin, why not just use Chopin?

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	DO we need another `Pride and Prejudice'? When we have already the excellent 1995 BBC TV mini-series? It depends solely on this - Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy. Without the chemistry between these endearingly headstrong characters, there is no point in making a new film, no matter how much money you spend on the sets and the costumes.The newest version of Jane Austen classic (`Pride & Prejudice') will be met with skepticism, but as far as Keira Knightley's portrait of this feisty heroine goes, it is a perfect success. Forget her terribly miscast role in `Domino,' and enjoy the film's spirited heroine who learns a thing or two about romance in the late 18th century England.Compared with her, Matthew Macfadyen who plays the laconic Mr. Darcy is less advantageous from the first. We have seen impeccable portrait from Colin Firth (and another impeccable one from Laurence Olivier), and who can forget them? Surprisingly, Macfadyen's Darcy turns out a convincing one, the aristocratic image of a person with something repressed deep inside. Unfortunately, he is not allowed to do much in this running time.[MODERN TOUCH ALL AROUND] I personally do not find the modernized dialogues exchanged between the characters so irritating as some viewers say. I know the film focuses the original book's romantic side, and gives less attention to the class structure of the Regency Britain. But if you have to make a 2-hour film, something must go. If romance must go, then ... what is the point of making this film anyway?But I thought first-time director Joe Wright did some missteps during those two hours. He uses too much showy camera works (there is a long one-take sequence in which the camera glides on the dancing floor) while more orthodox way of shooting the scenes are more effective. As to the portraits of the Bennet Family, some might find the eldest sister Jane (Rosamund Pike) is less impressive than she should be, and I for one thought Donald Sutherland, amusing as he is, might be too old for the role of Mr. Bennet.I know `Pride & Prejudice' should not be compared unfavorably with the previous versions though I was, and am, tempted to do so. Still I heartily enjoyed watching this beautifully-shot, well-acted film, and Ms. Knightley's Elizabeth is genuinely lovely and vivid.	4.0	"As Mr. Collins Says, This Is a ""Very Agreeable Alternative"": Pleasant Austen Adaptation with Keira Knightley's Vivid Portrait"	2006-02-15	3	1	2

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A16MDS80AER8CQ	T. Truong	I share something w/ many of the previous reviewers--e.g. I am female and love Jane Austen novels; however, I am aware that movie interpretations of her book tend to be more of the 'chick-flick' category; this was the first movie I have ever gone to see by myself (because I wanted to spare my boyfriend the experience, given above 'prejudice'); I thoroughly enjoyed the experience together w/ an equally enthused diverse full house; AND it is the only movie I have ever paid for to see an unreasonable 4 times in the theater, which brings me to something I have in common with ALL the previous reviewers:  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie.A big fan of Firth myself, I actually prefer this version to the A&E; series.  Despite the liberties taken, it aspires to be a much more real, down-to-earth vision of the novel, without the stuffy glorification of Britain's Romantic Era.  Firth is a natural Darcy (see other roles such as in Bridget Jones), but I loved the fresh youthful take of Knightly and McFaydden that brings modern relevance to this beloved classic and the growing pains of its timeless characters.Male/female, old/young, Firth-fan and Austinphile or not so much--this film is delightfully light-hearted, witty, and beautifully shot with a superb-cast!	5.0	refreshing take on period piece	2006-01-20	19	14	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	ANN4JW1E08AS6	tuberacer	I never saw this movie at the theater, but I purchased a full screen DVD version and absolutely love this movie. I have watched it countless times. Now I realize how lucky I was to get the full screen version. Recently, I borrowed a copy of the widescreen version from my local library just to see how much I was missing. For some reason, though, I didn't enjoy the widescreen version like I did the full screen version. I then used two computers to run both versions at once, cued at the same time, on side by side monitors and then it became glaringly obvious that the widescreen bars were cutting off immense amounts of important parts of the picture. Yes, the widescreen gives the wider shot, but most of composition of the focus of the scenes is not widescreen in nature, so you're not gaining a lot of important imagery from the widescreen format, but you are losing A LOT from the top and bottom that you get with the full screen format. This really surprised me. I've always assumed that widescreen versions were the full picture shown at the theaters. If the widescreen DVD version is the version shown on the big screen at the theater, then the theater audience missed a tremendous amount of the pleasure of watching this film. I have a hard time believing that this could be the case. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE VISUAL PLEASURE WITH THE FULLSCREEN VERSION. For instance, in the scene at Netherfield where Lydia asks Bingley to host a ball, in the shot of Bingley, Darcy, and Caroline, in the widescreen version, Caroline is cut off at the stomach by the lower bar, while on the fullscreen version of the same shot, you see her near fully sitting on the couch in a way that is very expressive for the scene. Frankly, I pity those who have only seen this movie on the widescreen DVD. What a great shame! How can this be? They don't know what they're missing and their appreciation of this film might be greatly improved by watching the fullscreen version.	5.0	Get the full screen version!	2013-01-02	0	0	0

I especially like the scenes when Lizzie is traveling with her aunt and uncle in the coach and also the scene in the field where Lizzie & Darcy meet early in the morning.And Mr Collins is both annoying & humorous.Lastly, Judi Dench is quite intimidating as Darcy's aunt Lady Catherine de Bourg-except to Lizzie!	5.0	Favorite version	2014-01-12	0	0	0

I've watched it only once. I really can't stand it, sorry to its avid fans. But, when one has watched Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth and a 6-hour, faithful-to-the-book adaptation, this really pales in comparison. A LOT. I really don't know what they were thinking when they cast Keira Knightley as Elizabeth. Instead of being a spirited young woman, she seems to be an egoistic teenager who can't keep her mouth to herself.Matthew McFadyen as Darcy was alright, but I agree he was rather wooden- Colin Firth spoke with his eyes, and through this we saw every unshaped thought and desire of his. It really disappointed me how so much of the book was cut (although more could not be expected from a movie), and the unfaithfulness to Austen's time period was simply shocking. When Jane was sick, Mr Bingley should NOT have walked in to see her! It was highly inappropriate and although I sound like a pedant, such small details ought to be considered in making the movie more memorable. Mr Bingley looked like a lovesick teenager, which was irksome too. *Sigh* maybe I expected too much...but is it wrong, when high-quality, endearing literature is in the mix?In its favor; the music and scenery. Both were exquisite, and (to others) patched up the movie's faults. Sorry to sound so harsh, but that's the way I felt."	2.0	It was JUST tolerable, I suppose...	2008-05-22	15	6	9

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AXRCPQD3CHK9X	tvnmoviefan	I am a big fan of Jane Austen and all of her work. I have actually taken a college class that dealt with all of her work- all 6 novels, her novella, and her unfinished novel Sanditon. I have always had a soft spot for Pride and Prejudice, and LOVE the A&E version (and Colin Firth). The only thing I didn't like about this new movie is a few historical inaccuracies. These, however, are easily passed over and you can see how wonderful this movie really is. Both Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen did an excellent job. I agree with someone who said in a previous post that they acted more along the lines with the ages of Elizabeth and Darcy. I really liked how they portrayed that sweet, soulful love that I understood Lizzie and Darcy to have. Also, that ending... what more could a P&P fan ask for? :)	5.0	Excellent	2006-01-22	13	11	2
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A72XD1X1DR8Q6	T. Webb	This version is an insult to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  I absolutely loved the novel and this movie did not come close to capturing the romance, charm and character of it.  It was as if the director hadn't even read or understood the novel.  There was no depth to Darcy's character.  The most vital points about his honorable character and integrity were left out. Elizabeth's discovery of this was poignant to her falling in love with him.  The scenes of their meetings were rushed (probably due to time constraints) one after another when in the book, months go by before they see each other again.  The portrayal of the Bennet family is exaggerated.  While Austen captures the heart of a woman with the slow and deliberate even agonizing wooing between Darcy and Elizabeth, this movie misses the mark.	1.0	If you loved the novel, this will be a big disappointment	2007-10-10	38	28	10

If I had to pick a favorite it's a tie between the Olivier version and this one.  I love all of them; but these two movies, I just think the chemistry was really right between the major stars.  I did like the new take on it also.  Of course in these theatrical versions a lot of the back story has to be cut as they have to move the story along; that's where the Garvie/Firth versions comes in and makes the story very enjoyable also.  My only quibble about the Olivier version, is that I think Greer Garson is just too old.  She's marvelous, but that little bit throws me off about the production.  As for my Darcys...Olivier, McFayden, Firth, Rintoul.  Elizabeths...Garson/Knightly (tie); Garvie, Ehle.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1AIW8QPB4TGMX	"Valerie Ann Webber ""vwalker72"""	This was a great movie and relatively faithful adaptation of the book. I just finished re-reading Pride & Prejudice about a week ago and wanted to watch the film, so I rented this and absolutely adored it. It is always tough to make a great book into a movie, but they did a great job with this one: they stayed relatively close to the original, simplifying a few plot lines to keep the story concise and focused. People who have read the book will know there is a lot more to Wickham's story, but you can definitely see why they would limit his time.I think the movie did a fantastic job of portraying the Charlotte/Collins relationship, which in turn highlights the really miserable life options women had in this time frame. As Charlotte says, &#34;I am 27 years old. I am already a burden on my family...&#34;Costume, hair and makeup were all excellent in this film. Casting was wonderful. Cinematography, fantastic.There was so much to like about this movie that renting it just wasn't enough. I want to have a copy for my collection so I can watch it again and again.I have a total book-characer crush on Mr. Darcy, and Keira Knightley did a wonderful job of showing just why Mr. Darcy would fall in love with her. Not only is she beautiful in a very natural way, she is sassy and she doesn't take any garbage from anyone, which was an extremely unusual trait in any woman of her time.Mrs. Bennett was just as fabulously inappropriate as she was in the book.My one disappointment with the movie is that they don't include any of the information that Jane Austen shared at the end of the book about how everyone's lives turned out later on--ie, what is life like for Lydia, Mary, Kitty and everyone else in the family five years down the road. I also thought they could have spent a bit more time highlighting the extremely awkward experience that Lydia's homecoming should have been. It is difficult, with our modern perspective, to really appreciate how just how completely inappropriate Lydia's behavior was.Still, one of the best great-book-to-movie adaptations I've seen.	5.0	I rented it, now I'm going to buy the DVD	2014-03-09	0	0	0

The characters in this movie were simply not built upon; as a family, the Bennets, were close and loving but you see none of that here. Mr. Collins character was not enlarged upon so you really don't get to see the odious little man he truly was.  In watching the ""Behind the Scenes"" special feature, several actors mentioned that Mr. Darcy was shy and that's the reason he was so aloof. Not so! Mr. Darcy was arrogant, proud and snobbish, all the characteristics that made Elizabeth fall in love with him, despite these failings.  He softened in her presence and she could see underneath his veneer, while others only saw the indifferent manner he displayed. The portrayal of Jane Bennet and Charles Bingley was ludicrous. These two people were not stumbling, bumbling idiots. They were kind, endearing people who loved each other on sight. There were times, I felt lost and I have two other versions of this love story. Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland were badly miscast.  Lady Catherine would have never made an appearance in the middle of the night to confront Elizabeth.  That scene was idiotic and again failed to show Lady Catherine's true character. I failed to connect with the characters nor the actors who played them.  I feel they were shortchanged by bad direction. My favorite production is the 1940's B&W version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. Although the '90's version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth was quite good.  Give Jane Austen another chance to impress you.

The reason I gave it only 4 stars though is because there were scenes in the older film version (from 1995 I believe) with Colin Firth that I would have loved to seen in this movie.  Also, the character of Mr. Darcy in this version didn't really have much to say which was disappointing.  Despite these two faults this is still a movie I will watch over and over again.	4.0	Great Jane Austen film!	2010-08-02	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2WLHX0B22Z5I	Volvi	I bought both versions at the same time the Firth 1995 and the above. Which to watch first was my initial dilemma. I decided on the above shorter version first and it was the right decision after having now watched watched both versions. Unlike any devout P&P; fan and not having seen either versions before, I at least can watch it for what it is without any pre-conceived notions. It wasnt long into watching this version which I will call the Knightley version, that I noticed a problem with the sound. I couldnt work out if it was me, the player or the transfer. Five to ten minutes in and I said to myself I cant the heck make out what theyre talking about. Dialogue was drowned out by over-powering background music and ran so fast. I had no choice but to start it again and put the subtitles on which as pointed out by another reviewer were often 3 liners and placed which was a nuisance. For that alone I had to drop 1 star when I would have awarded it 5 stars.Sure there was 'Poetic License' taken in this Knightley version. Like theyre manor was more like a farmhouse and very rough and hardly an upper middle to high class. Donald Sutherland though a great actor imho didnt suit his part, he hardly resembled the English Gentleman of his time, more like Colonial America civil war period. These things aside I found this version to be more dynamic then the Firth version. This version gave more goose bumps, lumps in throat and emotional tears. Knightley was perfect in her role she was more dynamic and head strong then in previous version. What you didnt see in this 2 hr.version I saw in the Firth version to fill in the gaps. Which is why I decided on the right version to start off my viewing. So all in all, dont miss this version, it was beautiful even with some of its flaws. It is as I say far more dynamic then the previous Firth version. I also preferred Darcy in this version.UPDATE:Well after seeing the 5 hr. Firth version I could not resist in watching this Knightley version yet once again. It was as moving as the first time I watched it. Only this time I added to my title review the words 'Magical and Etherial' for it truly is as such. Furthermore re the sound short comings. I viewed it this time without the annoying subtitles and came to the conclusion that whilst the production starts almost with a ball which drowned the dialogue I thereafter was able to go along with the dialogue as I say without the subtitles and was better off for it. One still may miss some dialogue as it is still an imperfect sound, but better to take in all the splendour then concentrate on reading every word of the subtitle. My main gripe is that this production should have been longer with at least 3 hours. Especially missing is a wedding scene in its finale and makes ruse with dialogue depicting post marriage. Nevertheless truly magical and NOT to be missed.If you found this review helpful at all please vote on it. Thanks. Pleasant viewing.	4.0	Dynamic, Magical and Etherial.	2010-03-12	8	6	2

Turning the Bennet home into a hovel, where huge pigs roam freely and laundry suffocates the yard, and an unkempt, filthy-looking Mr. Bennet is perhaps a misguided attempt to make Darcy look far, far superior to Elizabeth, and makes his descent to her level perhaps more accessible to those who don't read and don't have an understanding of the time.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2AGBL998D0FYY	VReviews	Jane Austen affected a sea change in the novel in the early 1800s. Before that time the novel was limited to rather farfetched adventure stories like Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. In the early 19th century, writing about everyday events was quite out of the ordinary, and Jane was the first to successfully portray the behind the scenes workings of the ladies and gentlemen of the English countryside.Watching a new adaptation of a Jane Austen novel is like seeing Shakespeare's Hamlet, there are no surprises in the final outcome. Rather the entertainment comes in the particular adaptation, actor's skills, and production qualities. Austen's Pride & Prejudice is one of her most popular novels, and each time it has found it's way onto the big screen and into DVD it's created a lot of passion for and against the adaptation.Universal's production has had a number of disappointed viewers as evidenced by many an online review. This disappointment typically seems to stem with having something to do with the casting decisions and the perceived lack of chemistry between the principal players. Conversely, some felt there was too much chemistry, or not enough propriety in the manner in which the Bennet's conducted themselves. Or that the Bennet's were incorrectly shown to be struggling financially and therefore didn't live or dress up to the idealized version of English gentility.To the chemistry of the actors, I believe the casting in Universal's version was excellent. Matthew Macfadyen perfectly portrayed the aloof, shy, yet emotionally caring Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightley is a surprise in this role, for she is able to capture the strong-willed, hastily opinionated and yet free spirited Elizabeth Bennet quite well. But more importantly, this adaptation develops the full picture of the Bennet Family, with all five Bennet girls, with their individual personalities vying for the best dress, or introduction. Both Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet, and Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet are superb in their timing, and comedic needling of one another. Judi Dench as the controlling Lady Catherine de Bourg, is pleasingly condescending wicked.Screenwriter Deborah Moggach portrayed the Bennet family in a very real and grounded environment. While she may have packaged Austen's novel in a less glamorous light than is typical; she was able to reflect the troubling circumstances people of that time had to deal with.  After all, the financial fix and worry of having five girls with no inheritance in 18th century England was the very point of view and experience that Jane wrote from.Between Director Wright and screenwriter Moggach, this version of Pride & Prejudice is deeply thought-provoking, and portrays the ups and down, moral questions, dilemmas, and hardships of being in society in the 18th century.	5.0	Full Picture of the Bennet Family	2011-05-17	5	4	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	While PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is admittedly gorgeous on almost every visual level, a weak script and strange interpretations by both director and actors mar this otherwise enjoyable film. Joe Wright directs this adaptation of the Jane Austin classic that pairs a country girl lacking looks but loaded with prejudice - played by Keira Knightley - with a city gentleman short on personality but full of pride - played by Matthew Macfadyen. While Wright is true to the period as far as look, he is utterly clueless as far as the manners and customs of the people.So many things that happened left me scratching my head. For example, would the Bennet family really have left their laundry hanging on the line at the beginning of a rainstorm while they stood at the window watching? This may say something about the impracticality of the Bennets; but the way it was handled, it says more about the naivete of the director. Also, people walking in and out of other people's houses and bedrooms unannounced; the grandest lady of the county, Lady Catherine, dropping by unescorted in the middle of the night - and sunburned, no less; a gentleman showing up at dawn to propose, and on foot; everyone getting up from a meal so two people could talk instead of sending them into the parlor: people were more formal and considerate than that in the late 1700's and early 1800's. These types of faux pas break down the credibility of the film and make it less than it could have been.My biggest problem was with the two stars. While Keira Knightly was winsome enough as Elizabeth Bennet, her mischievous smile reminded me of a cat or rat. And since she smiles a lot in the film, I had a hard time warming up to her. Most disappointing, though, was Matthew Macfadyen's downright wooden portrayal of Mr. Darcy. I do believe there is a way to play a character lacking personality without becoming a moribund oaf. Neither actor is particularly attractive in this production, and their odd expressions and mannerisms make them even less so. And their lack of chemistry - even though their relationship is supposed to be alienating and strained - is almost painful. Again, there is a way for two people to act like they dislike each other and still show the telltale signs of a growing attraction. When their love for each other is finally revealed, it seems very unlikely. It certainly isn't emotionally explosive the way the revelation of love between Edward and Elinor in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was. The supporting cast members give far more interesting performances than the stars, and, in most cases, outshine them.The most redeeming aspect of this film is visual, especially the cinematography, which is stunning. There is one tracking shot at the party which is very clever, and makes us feel we are part of it. It begins with Mr. Bennet closing the keyboard to the piano on Mary who had been indiscreetly singing away, continues through the various rooms and conversations, and ends with Mr. Bennet and Mary making up, with a final tag of Elizabeth outside by herself. The entire shot lasts 3 minutes - it seems longer - and is masterful. Another noteworthy shot - less clever because of its self-consciousness - is one of Elizabeth on a swing in the barn, and we are spinning with her, watching the different scenes outside the barn change as they go flying past. While the technique is interesting, it is disruptive, because we are no longer lost in the story, but have suddenly become aware of the camera and what it is doing - an unforgivable sin in cinematography. Other shots of the sumptuous interiors and breathtaking landscapes are wonderful.Overall, this is a fun and enjoyable film, if you can get past the disconcerting anachronisms. It doesn't rank with Ang Lee and Emma Thompson's SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, which had a far better script, far better acting and very few if any anachronisms. But it is good for what it is: a visual feast.Waitsel Smith	4.0	GORGEOUSLY MOUNTED, BUT LACKING THE DRAMATIC DEPTH OF SENSE AND SENSIBILITY	2006-06-24	11	7	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A151T9C99W0AA	Walter P. Sheppard	"I guess I'm in the minority among reviewers, but I'll stick with my opinion that this is a travesty of Austen's matchless novel.  (I'd give it no stars if the system allowed.)  Virtually every production detail -- the costumes, the hair styles, the number of people at the balls, failure to show Darcy's attraction to Lizzy from the first, behavior of individual characters (Bingley's entering Jane's room in the night, Lady Catherine's pounding on the door for a night time visit), the ludicrous sculpture gallery at Pemberley etc. etc. -- is wrong.  The abilities of such actors as Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland are wasted by a script that essentially gives them nothing worthwhile to do.  They are reduced to being little more than set decoration.  A single feature film cannot include everything in the novel, of course (the much praised 1995 BBC production left things out, too), but a better script would more truly reflect the original, and none of the production details listed can be explained as necessary because of the limitations of adaptation.  Even the old Greer Garson-Laurence Olivier film, which is pretty bad, is a better adaptation than this one.  If you want ""Pride and Prejudice"" in video form, get either of the BBC adaptations for a version far closer to what Austen wrote."	1.0	A Travesty	2006-03-20	58	36	22
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2W4PSP3I7CL4B	WAMophile	I was very prepared to like this film. I wanted to like it. I'd been warned about the liberties it took.  I'd already heard that it had played havoc with Austen's language, pacing and intent.  I'd heard about the pigs, the period inappropriate behavior of the characters, the idiosyncratic scenes such as the midnight arrival of the great Dragon Lady, the bursting into ladies rooms, the list is endless.  I was prepared for all these absurdities, but had also heard that it was cinematically lovely, took chances and the characters were age appropriate. Yet still I was appalled by the reality.In all fairness we've been spoilt by the last 1995 tremendous miniseries adaptation by the BBC. And a 2 hour movie by its very nature cannot do justice to Austen's matchless prose and wit. But it was horrifying to watch an Austen film stripped of subtlety, wit, pace, delicate but biting social observation (there was nothing hinted at here, it's thrown in your face like slop at a pig!) and almost completely denuded of that sublime Austen language.It's difficult to say at whose feet lies the blame for the terrible acting choices, the horrible editing, the nonsensical exposition. Even the music, which at times I enjoyed as it was very reminiscent of Chopin/Beethoven/Mozart is almost too wall to wall and syrupy and turns Austen into mush.I am making a mad dash for my 1995 BBC version to cleanse my palate and am only thankful that I only rented this version.	2.0	a ghastly disappointment	2006-09-14	41	22	19
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2CDMCG1Z84A51	Wanda B. Red	I watched both the 2005 film and the 1995 A&E; version close together in time; both are wonderful - the film manages to achieve almost the same effect in just under half the time. Both are respectful of Austen's novel.The new film version is very very fine. The biggest difference between the two is the space allowed to develop various aspects of character and plot (i.e., in the `95 TV series we see the developments from Lizzie's AND Darcy's points of view, we see them in flashback, sometimes multiple times). But the new film version does an excellent job of conveying the book, even if some scenes must necessarily be omitted. The flashbacks of the A&E; version are an easy way of telegraphing a character's second thoughts, but a really good actor can convey doubt and complexity without this assistance.The hardest character for an actor to portray in Austen's novel is Mr. Darcy. Is he a prideful and arrogant aristocrat who changes -- that is, is he a bad character who grows, develops, and becomes good? Or is he a good character who, from the outset, is at least partly misunderstood? There is evidence to support both interpretations. As we learn, all his family, including his servants, who have known him for his whole life admire his integrity and his kindness. But he certainly gives Elizabeth Bennet reason from the outset to find him cold, distant, and even snobbish. However terrific Colin Firth is in the A&E; version, his representation of the character comes down pretty strongly for change and growth, while Matthew MacFadyen, the hero of the recent film and the sweetest Mr. Darcy you would ever want to meet, keeps the question open. His reserve at the beginning could easily be chalked up to shyness. Both Darcies have much to recommend them. Even though Firth leaves more of the impression of confidence and sharpness that I got from Austen's novel, I think I actually prefer the sweetness of MacFadyen, who does a better job of convincing us that he actually finds Elizabeth attractive from the beginning.I'm not a fan of the actress who plays Elizabeth in the 2005 film -- Keira Knightley (her name rhymes with sprightly, only too conveniently) -- but she does credit, in her odd and energetic way, to Lizzie Bennet, and Donald Sutherland makes a surprisingly good Mr. Bennet (though perhaps not quite so true to the book as Benjamin Whitrow in the A&E; version). As much as I admire Brenda Blethyn in other films she is not great here; she is nothing to the earlier BBC Bennet mother Alison Steadman, who more perfectly captures the mother's hysterics. And I don't think Judi Dench is well cast as Lady Catherine de Bourgh (in the movie); she is just too regal and admirable in her own right; Lady Catherine needs a certain reptilian quality, which Barbara Leigh-Hunt in the A&E; production manages very capably. Also, I must admit that Tom Hollander's Mr. Collins in the 2005 does not hold a candle to the simpering skin-crawling performance of David Bamber in the BBC version of that part. Despite these quibbles, however, the makers of this film had their wits about them. Most importantly, they were not afraid of emotion. Both versions end with a very satisfying and un-Austenlike kiss.The music in this film is lush and engaging; the landscape, notwithwithstanding the opinion of other reviewers, captures the constrained circumstances of the Bennets while remaining appropriately Anglophilic in its attachment to the British countryside and country houses. In short, this new movie manages to convey the essence of the book nearly as well and just as movingly as the excellent A&E; series, which is twice as long.	5.0	Wonderful -- Charming Darcy	2006-04-05	19	13	6
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2KU5PG32H7QBN	"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic"""	"""Pride and Prejudice,"" Joe Wright's adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, is peculiarly radient in that these sort of adaptations (for instance, the same novel's '95 television miniseries) are always done with an air of leisure, which is, unless handled well, simply another word for intense boredom; not to say director Wright cheapens the novel in any way. In fact, his luminosity only deepens what societal subtext there is, exciting and intriguing the senses with every frame. We can all from here on out exhale with relief at the thought of a period piece that does not meander but instead distills a piece of art to its exuberant soul while also providing an expansive emphasis on society, in this case Victorian-era Britain. Never are the bounds of marriage forgotten, or the lack of money, or the ridiculousness of romanticism in the context of Austen society (Charlotte, heroin Elizabeth Bennet's good friend, at some point says ""I can't afford to be romantic"" when defending her marriage to the sycophant Mr. Collins, a line that is all the more poignant coming from the fantastic Claudie Blakley).Perhaps what most distinguishes this version of the well-known tale of the Bennet sisters is the casting. I wholeheartedly call it perfect, with each daughter containg their aesthetic qualities and personality quirks as described in the novel. As with most British costume dramas, the supporting cast is pitch-perfect throughout, including Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. Matthew McFayden plays Darcy convincingly, which is important considering the emotional arc he's called the portray. The biggest surprise, however, is most certainly Keira Knightly, who I expected to be nothing short of a mess but instead gives off the sharp, modest beauty inherent in Elizabeth Bennet.In my recent essay on the novel ""Pride and Prejudice"" for AP Literature, I concluded in saying that above all Austen makes the point ""that all people deserve to love and deserve to be satisfied with who they are and who they grow to be."" Joe Wright's largest accomplishment is making me believe said message all over again. Even if the accomplishment is rather minor in terms of cinema (though major when considering that it's a debut), it compells on every level, a quality in film that's been missing for most of the year."	5.0	Surprisingly great	2005-12-21	7	4	3

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3QWKAWJCZ1OS3	"Warrior Two ""Electric Boogaloo"""	"The most basic description of Jane Austen's book, ""Pride and Prejudice"", is that it is a humorous, romantic satire about the hypocrisy of class distinctions among the landed gentry. That is to say, it's about ""rich"" vs. ""poor"" (where the poor aren't really all that poor). In England, in the early 1800's--the setting of this book--there was a great deal wrong with system of money and property transfer, which was very patriarchal, and terribly unfair to women, and the behavior of the so-called elite towards those who weren't fortunate enough to be born into wealth. Part of the humor and genius of P&P; is how refined, polite and kind the lower-class Jane and Elizabeth behave as compared to Lady Catherine, Miss Bingley, and Mr. Collins, all of whom possess all the appearance of class while being as rude and insulting as possible. Jane Austen was making a tart social statement as well as delivering a heady romance.So what on earth is going on in this film? The Bennets aren't so much landed gentry as flat-out peasants. They all behave abominably. The language isn't playful and dripping with hidden meaning; it's ultra-modernized and dumbed down. As far as the total reinterpretation of the story, I am guessing that the writer and director don't even know what this story is all about or threw it aside in favor of making this into a bodice-ripper.  Mr. Darcy, a member of the highest possible social rank, might look down on Elizabeth as a potential wife for being born to a family with less money, but there is NO way that a man of his stature would EVER propose to someone who lives in squalor and has no manners, as this Elizabeth is portrayed. It's as if they were all blowsy Americans, as opposed to stiff-upper-lip Britons.As far as the performances go, the actors here are dreadful. Keira Knightley is the same character in every single movie she's done--either open mouthed and wide-eyed like a deer in the headlights, or with a pinched and vacant smile. Matthew McFayden has as much range as a saltine cracker. The rest of the Bennet girls are indistinguishable from one another, and in fact, I kept getting Charlotte confused for one of them, because they all looked and acted identical to one another. There was wayyyy too much giggling.The period details are all out of whack. Why is Lady Catherine wearing a hairstyle that was popular around the time she would have been born? Why does Caroline look like a character out of a contemporary sitcom? The whole fast-and-loose approach with the styles, mannerisms, and language of the period make it impossible to mentally inhabit the period they're portraying. The behavior, language, clothing and set design are so completely wrong for the period that the only way this film would work would be as science fiction. They should have avoided doing a period piece at all."	1.0	Would have been better with zombies	2011-08-18	14	7	7

Judi Dench and Kiera's rapid fire repart&eacute;es are beautiful to behold. At the end when the view of Mr. Darcy's home across the lake was shown, there were swans swimming about.

I was sorry to see it end!	5.0	Just as Good as the BBC miniseries	2013-05-05	0	0	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1YQS7S1IE53SB	Wendy C. Rigney	"In watching this version of Jane Austen's classic novel of love, marriage, and class distinctions of Regency England, all I could think of was that, while pleasing to the eye, Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen were less playing Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet than versions of Heathcliff and Catherine in Emily Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights"".Knightley's Elizabeth struck me as self important, dramatic, and smug rather than intelligent and full of life. Why was she always snarling, smiling, or generally baring her teeth? MacFadyen's Darcy, rather than proud, alternating between shyness and simply looking like he wanted to cry. Where was the pomposity? The disdain for others around him? I saw none of that.This is not even touching the appalling additions of such things as pigs in the living room and the generally unkempt appearance of the Bennets and their living situation. Mr. Bennet was a bookkeeper, a gentleman. The book states that the Bennets were ""not too poor"" and still managed to appear well mannered and well groomed despite the lack of funds. So the dirt and the farm animals were unneeded and had no point relevant to the ""Pride and Prejudice"" I have read. If they were that poor, what would be the point of the fuss made over Lizzie getting her skirt inches in mud on the way to visit Jane? There'd be nothing to remark on, because it would be the norm. And it is not.But back to ""Pride and Prejudice"" meets ""Wuthering Heights"". I get the idea was likely to appeal to the greater masses. But the Harlequinesque declarations and outright lack of propriety shown in the film - the flowing hair, the over the top emotion, the schmaltz - is counterproductive to the novel. I could buy the sap in ""Wuthering Heights"" because Heathcliff and Catherine were both so dramatic on their own that their romance and doom were highlighted by such actions. Mr. Darcy and Lizzie were more circumspect. No less passionate, but their passion lay in their mannerisms and their verbal sparring, not walking around in bare feet, nightgowns, or half-done shirts. No, no, no. Leave that to Emily Bronte, not Jane Austen.As for the rest, no way would single men visit sick single women when they are alone. Reputation, as was one point of the novel, meant everything. Such an action would be scandalous back in the day. A woman would NOT be seen with her hair down. Lizzie would not giggle endlessly and lick her fingers and act as silly as Lydia. No way would Mr. Darcy EVER deliver that letter in the way he did. And the first proposal: the book mentioned Charlotte's parlor. It should have been left at that. The rain was, again, more dramatic, but it did not fit for these characters, especially not at that juncture of their acquaintance. And no way would Lady Catherine go to Longbourn in the dead of night to have it out with Lizzie over her intentions for her nephew. It's all wrong.I am glad for those who enjoy this version, but if the filmmaker wanted over the top romance, he should have left Jane Austen alone and gone with the more lushly romantic aforementioned Emily Bronte. The Bronte-ization of ""Pride and Prejudice"" left me cold and diluted Jane Austen's observations about love, marriage, society, and money and turned the story into just another romance flick. Give me the A&E; miniseries, please."	1.0	Pride and Prejudice is not Wuthering Heights!	2008-03-26	175	139	36

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A24J6PQ0FN55A6	WestGrl	"I'm an avid book reader so I know anytime a book I love is made into a movie, I will probably dislike some portion of it. You can never get everything from a book into a movie & books leave room for imagination. The reader will form a vision of the character in their minds, so when a fan of a writer or a particular novel finds the actor didn't fit that vision, they are unhappy. So I don't doubt that avid Austen readers will find problems with the movie.Looking at it purely from a movie objective. I loved it. I thought it was well acted and written. It very much reminded me of ""Sense & Sensibility"", which I also loved. I was fortunate, I guess you could say, that I have never read ""Pride & Prejudice"" so I was left in suspense as to whether Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth would ever be together. This certainly added to my pleasure of the movie. The movie allowed me to get to know all the characters. It definately drew out the romantic dreamer in me and I was crying at the end. I plan to read the book now, and I am sure I will have some opinions as to how the book compares to the movie, but for those that just love a good romantic movie.... watch it!"	5.0	For true romantics & dreamers	2007-01-06	5	4	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2YBRZFREWKKY6	W	Many reviews compare this version of the movie to the television mini-series.  I would encourage audiences to take the film on its own merits, though as a Colin Firth fan, I will admit that can be a difficult thing to do.  Give Matthew Macfadyen a chance.  I like this role and other work he's done.This is an enjoyable film.  While some of the locations are changed, and it doesn't use the exact language of the book, I think it keeps very closely to the spirit and plot of the book. The Mr. Wickham story is severly compressed, but I think that they get the point across.  Besides, with the shorter time allotment, I would rather that was clipped than some other sections.  Especially enjoyable was the treatment of Mrs. Bennett.  Some versions make her so vapid and silly one wonders how she functions in society at all.  This Mrs. Bennett was more balanced while still fiting the character of the novel.Also memorable is the look of the film.  The sets, scenery, and costumes all feel realistic, and yet they are not so real and gritty that they lose their beauty.Overall, this is a fine film and well worth watching.	5.0	Take It on Its Own Merits	2006-02-25	15	11	4

To say I was bitterly disappointed is a supreme understatement!! There was absolutely NOTHING i liked about it.It was altered dramatically from the beautiful funny and heartwarming book Jane A wrote, into a commercial, inaccurate, and brash Hollywood version. I felt like every bit of character Jane A infused ito the book had been bleached out. Perhaps the most disappointing thing was the casting of Keira K as Elizabeth. There was very little of Elizabeth in her performance in fact I really disliked her character (and I love Elizabeth!!). I suppose after watching the A&E; verion the standard is very high and this scraped the bottom of the barrel!!!	1.0	Bitterly Disappointed!!!!!	2008-04-17	34	25	9

Her fanatic mother wants them all married because if their father dies they would have nothing. This is because in this time period females can't inherit. The setting is set in an older time period.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2JP93R23ZMHQL	"Will73 ""William"""	"It is August 2011, and this is the first time that I have watched the 2005 Joe Wright-directed ""Pride & Prejudice"". In MY pride and prejudice, I believed that the 1995 BBC version with Colin Firth to be the definitive adaption of the Jane Austen novel, and I refused to even give this movie a chance; that's how certain I believed it would be inferior, HAD to be inferior to the production I loved.  I now believe that this latest version may be the most romantic film of all time, bettering 'Casablanca', 'Gone with the Wind', 'Dr. Zhivago' and in it's comic way 'Moonstruck'. This film is cinematic Art. Every second of this film is a study in lighting (mindful of a Vermeer), costume, direction, and the score is lush, as opposed to over produced. Throughout we have a piano evoking every feeling, every desire and every longing on a summer's day, a walk through moors, a dance with delight as it soars with the love that is growing between Lizzie and Mr. D'Arcy. Every scene of this film has meaning; nothing is superfluous, and not a second is spent wasted in tedium. Keira Knightly is luminous, yet tactile, bright, sharp with wit, and vulnerable with adolescence. There are a couple of scenes with Mathew Macfayden which positively crackled on screen with such eroticism, such intense yet discrete sensuality that they linger in the mind. One is where he simply and surprisingly puts his hand under Lizzie's to assist her climbing onto a carriage. The touch is unexpected by her, and her look is one of offense, and passion simultaneously. It is just a brief part of a second, and yet as Mr. D'Arcy walks away, his hand opens and practically trembles from the electric shock of that skin on skin contact; a horse snorts as he walks quickly away from his assault: he HAD to touch her. The film is photographed to perfection, from  English countryside landscapes with birds singing in the trees, to the inner rooms of the Bennet household, alive with the frolic of having five girls in the house creates. The characters are not stuffy recreations, but real people, and we relate to their relationships, and to their status and to their family life. It all leads up to a scene with Mr D'Arcy walking across the fog-misted moors before dawn to make an hopeful quest for Lizzi's heart. Mathew Macfayden seduces anybody who watches that scene, as the camera catches him from afar and stays right on him as he looms larger and clearer and dearer to Lizzie the closer he gets. One of the best, if not the best film of all time. A MUST SEE."	5.0	Staggeringly beautiful	2011-08-18	5	4	1

Adams	This must be at least the fourth film version of the book that I've seen, and I also saw a stage version back when I was a child, 50 years ago. I never actually read the novel, but I think this production is pretty good. It has younger actors than one usually sees in P and P adaptations, and I found that refreshing, even if the quality of the acting might be less than perfect. I thought it got off to a bit of a slow start, but raced to a fine finish. And lead actress KK is simply irresistable.	4.0	Rewarding romance rental...	2006-09-13	6	1	5

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1ACUHYUW6UANH	Wil Roese	I believe Jane Austen's initial tittle for the book on which this movie is based was First Impressions. To me that tittle better conveys the theme, that our first impressions of others are often grossly mistaken. Lizzy's first impressions of two of the men in her life were wrong. One for the better and one for the worse. My first impression of Lizzy was also wrong. At the beginning of the movie, I was disappointed to find Lizzy as a shallow, giggly girl looking to marry a rich man, but as the movie goes on (slowly at times) I was pleased to learn Lizzy was the complete opposite of my initial impression.	4.0	First Impressions	2006-03-19	12	7	5
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3ICVJQMZAGQV5	wisdomstar	I first read this book in college and loved it, so I have seen all the versions from the silly Lawrence Olivier version to now. My favorite still remains the 1995 Colin Firth version, but this one is also a keeper. Kiera Knightley is wonderful as she has been so far in everything she has played. The scenery alone is well worth the price of the DVD. The settings give you a real flavor of the time - early 1800's - and the muddy way that people lived. No wonder the upper class were revolted by country manners - with a pig that size in the house? Brenda Blethyn does a wonderful job as Mrs. Bennett, as do the four sisters. But, for those of us who know the book by heart, this version is a disappointment. I miss many of the lines I love - they are either missing or thrown away in a mumble. The hair stylist should have done more research as should the writer - I agree that the 'faux pas' - Elizabeth running around in her nightgown - Darcy waltzing into the Collins' whenever he feels like it - are GLARING. It disrupts the reality for those of us who know the manners of that time better. But the real problem with it is Darcy - Darcy has to be cold and haughty, warm and shy, and sexy. MacFayden does angry and appalled, and little else. The director said that he did not want to cast someone too handsome and he certainly has followed through on that. MacFayden could have been cast as one of the farm hands much more easily. Love stories have to be believable - you have to believe that someone as great as Kiera Knightley is going to fall for the guy. With Orlando Bloom this works. But not here - such a shame. Lastly, although I like Donald Sutherland, he plays Mr. Bennett as though he on the edge of senility - Mr. Bennett has a lot of great lines in this story but I'm not surprised that other viewers didn't value them because Sutherland threw them away if he got to say them at all. Read the book, it's funnier.	3.0	great scenery, but jane austen is funnier	2006-03-09	24	12	12

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A7Q9TV61USLVF	Woody	While I am a huge fan and appreciate the quality and content of many BBC productions, this movie is quite possibly the greatest romantic film ever made.  Even though Jane Austin purists may think it is subpar, I advise taking it for its own qualities and strengths.  This rendition of Pride and Prejudice is simply a masterpiece!  Kiera Knightley should have won best actress and this film should have won best film of the year.  The acting by the two leads is exceptional, the musical score is moving, the choreography is beautiful, the storyline terrific, the humor is engaging, and the romance inspiring.  This film holds you in its grip and does not let go.  It is a movie to watch over and over again.  Joe Wright did an outstanding job directing.  (This is far superior to the movie Atonement, by the way).  If you are truly a romantic at heart you cannot miss this movie or deny its intensity.	5.0	A Romantic Masterpiece	2011-03-01	3	2	1

In fact, I was pretty excited about it.As we started watching the movie, we were like, ""Why can't we understand what they're saying."" The first half-hour seemed muffled, then they spoke more clearly.On the movie, I thought it was just OK. This version didn't need to be made. A much better version exists out there and that's the 1995 A&E; version. Too many scenes were shortened to accommodate for time and I think it hurt the movie. I don't think there was chemistry between Lizzy and Mr. Darcy. Lydia's character should have been expanded on as well as Mrs. Bennet to understand these characters. Mr. Wickham was barely there and you don't know how terrible his unless you've read the book. By the other characters telling us his story doesn't help us loathe him the way we should. I could go on but there isn't enough space.On the positive side: the Cinematography was very good and the ending, though completely fabricated, gave it a nice ending, hence the two stars given."	2.0	Condensed Doesn't Make Better	2006-01-03	11	3	8

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1YEL87FWFZN14	Xaphania	First, to all of the Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth lovers (of which, I am one), we will always have that remarkable masterpiece.  Therefore, we should be able to judge any new versions freely.  Having said that, this version is great!This movie is quite shorter than what we're used to for P&P; adaptations and at first it seemed to me that the dialogue was rushed, but after the first 15 minutes it either slowed down or I ceased to notice it, until Darcy's proposal scene anyway, but it worked quite well there.This film is also much more of a comedy than the two BBC versions.  There were minor changes with dialogue but none of the changes lessened any of the characters or the spirit of the story.  Instead, it probably enhanced the feelings the audience shared with the characters. In fact, I think that everything left out of the two previous BBC versions were added to this one so you still get something new from the same story.One major change is the loss of Mr. and Mrs. Hurst.  In a two-hour movie there just isn't enough time to do their characters justice.  The rest of the cast is so marvelous though that we barely notice they're missing and it makes the movie flow more naturally.The actors chosen are wonderful in their parts.  I didn't think I'd be able to accept Keira Knightley as Elizabeth but after the first five minutes I was completely taken in by her.  She pulls off Elizabeths witty dialogue like, well... Elizabeth and just as Jennifer Ehle added some distinctive traits to Lizzie, so does Keira.  She wonderfully manages to show us Lizzie's love of a good laugh without making it seem as though she was a giggling loony and every time she smiles, we smile with her.I won't critique all the performances but I have to add that Donald Sutherland really does a spectacular job as the head of a household of silly women.  The last scene with him and Lizzie had me in tears.Not to say that this movie was perfect, what adaptation can be without some faults or silly alterations?  None are too serious though.  The first is at the Meryton ball, when Darcy, Bingley and Caroline walk in, everything stops.  The music, the dancing, all conversation and the crowd parts to offer them a path.  I thought for a second the crowd had mistaken Mr. Bingley for royalty.  It just seemed a bit over the top.  But it passed quickly enough.  The other was actually Darcy's proposal scene which was done in the rain.  I thought it silly that he would follow her outside in such weather to propose, but one can accept that in view of the other changes that turned out so well.I give this movie 5 stars because I wouldn't want to miss it and I don't think any P&P; fan should.All in all, if you have a good sense of humor and aren't afraid to laugh, like Elizabeth, you will just enjoy the story as it is played out.  Remember, afterwards you can always put Jennifer and Colin Firth back in the DVD player.	5.0	A Great and Fun Version	2006-01-14	142	125	17
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A0961332GV25C93YELZ5	x	The girls giggle too much. The character of Lydia does not speak clearly when she is at the dinner table after she marries.  The  background sound over powers the actors so you are forever adjusting the volume. Could they have found any more dull and dowdy clothes? The overall film is far more dreary than the other versions. Also, do we need to see so many farm animals? It gives the film an appearance that the Bennet family were poor farm tenents. The scene with the huge pig was ridiculous. This version lacks the elegance of the other two older versions. Based on this version it is difficult to imagine Mr. Darcy ever being interested in Elizabeth.

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2WI2336OJNW7T	Y. Alexander	"I finally purchased this DVD to add to my collection of favorite movies. I was torn between the full screen format or widescreen, and opted for the latter. I really detest the black screen above and below the video, however was concerned over images being cut off by the full screen format.  Anyhow, this is the background that led me to purchase this movie.I'm rather embarrassed to admit that I had never read Jane Austen's masterpiece, nor was aware of the story line. I happened to be flipping through the TV channels one evening and this movie was on. I watched and absolutely fell in love with the story and the characters, particularly that of Mr. Darcy played by Mathew McFayden. It was entertaining to see him transform from the condescending snob at the initial ball to a sexy romantic in the final scene; one of the best love stories I have ever witnessed. The movie had me and I viewed it several times on TV.Then, I happened to catch the BBC miniseries version one evening with Colin Firth. Luckily all episodes played simultaneously, so I spent 6 hours watching these new characters and altered story line of what I was accustomed. Admittedly, it was disheartening to watch these new actors initially . There could never be a better Mr. Darcy than Mathew McFayden, and Colin Firth did not quite fit the bill, IMO. However, by the 4th episode, my feelings gave way and I actually enjoyed the development of all the characters. Although the contrast of Keira Knightly and Jennifer Ehle as Lizzie Bennet is quite evident, I rather liked both. Additionally, it was quite enjoyable to watch a young Colin Firth (I knew him only from ""The King's Speech""). I recorded these episodes to my DVR and have watched several times. Colin Firth's Darcy definitely comes off as more proud and conceited than the 2005 version, and the intimacy of that momentous kiss at the end lacked luster. However, the story line in whole still captures my heart and it is nice to go back and forth between the 2 versions.I happened to discover and watch a third version, another BBC miniseries made in the 80's. Since my evaluation of these movies are based upon my interpretation of Mr. Darcy's character, I must confess that David Rintoul's physical appearance was too thin and not sexy enough. I observed some differences in the 2 miniseries, from the more elaborate costumes, the enhanced vulgarity of Mrs Bennett and her younger daughters, and the more even- tempered attitude of Darcy.By now, I had become enamored with Pride and Prejudice. I discovered yet another version made in 1940 with Laurence Olivier as Mr. Darcy. I disliked him even more than David Rintoul's interpretation. I equally disliked the gaudy costumes, the limited scenes (although this would be expected in 1940), and the fact that Lady Catherine de Bourgh schemed with Darcy to influence Lizzy's decision to marry him. Although I hadn't read the book, I knew that the scene could not have been part of the original story  because it just didn't make sense.And so, I decided to read the book and see for myself which version was more accurate. It took all of 48 hours to complete and it is now one of my favorite novels. I must admit that the 2 miniseries most correspond to the novel, particularly the one that was made in the 1980's. Also, I now see that the 2005 version was a hurried and condensed adaptation of the book, however this is still my favorite and Mathew McFayden will forever be my Mr. Darcy :-)"	5.0	Oh, Mr. Darcy!	2013-11-29	1	1	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A35W50ZM9EK38Q	Y	Beautifully shot, this is an enjoyable movie, although true Austen fans may find it outragous sometimes. For instance, the custumes for the Bennetts look very shabby; the interior of the Bennett's house looks like a French country house; the first dance scene (when Darcy shows up) is very country-side like (are these people really gentlemen and ladies, I almost wondered out loud) ......But overall, I still enjoyed watching it multiple times. You have to remember this is a Hollywood rendition of a much loved story. Don't be offended by its lack of authenticity.	3.0	If you're a true Austen fan, you may find this movie odd	2007-07-30	8	5	3
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2RR4S9Z28BY5C	Y movie buff	Jane Austen is timeless, as is proven by her popularity as much today as it was in almost 200 years ago!  Her choice of subject matter of human nature will always appeal to people.  This movie is an artist's perspective of one of the greatest novels ever written.  The mood, the use of a muted color pallet and musical score create a visual image of beauty, which portrays the novels theme perfectly.  I am convinced that if Jane Austen were alive today, that film would have been her chosen form of artistic expression and this movie one of her creations.  Kiera Knightley lends an almost luminous quality to Elizabeth Bennet, with a slight edge of mischievousness.  In my opinion the best P&P ever!	5.0	Breathtaking	2008-02-01	4	3	1

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A2FWK2B6SRNG2A	Yudith	I saw this movie the first time in 2005, and LOVED it. I enjoyed this movie so much that I decided to read the book, and to be honest I'm wasn't a fan of classical romance or any kind of romance ( and I'm girl) but that all changed after P & P. I love Matthew Macfadyen as Mr.Darcy.He was born to play Mr.Darcy.And Keira Knightley is a excellent actress and she did a superb job as Elizabeth. I recommend this movie to everyone I know because it made a great impression on me.This movie really makes you feel so many emotions, you'll cry, laughed, and at the end you will truly believe in true love.P.S.: I tried to watch the 1995 BBC P & P but in my opinion the actors portraying the characters are so bland and boring, but again that's MY opinion.	5.0	My favorite movie	2010-11-28	3	2	1

The movie, focuses more on the Bennett family and the love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.  It truly is a wonderful movie.	5.0	Exceptional	2006-03-13	10	6	4

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A3Q8QAG0OSGMT6	Yvonne Creek	I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't at least a 2-Disc Special Edition of this movie. The movie is entertaining and gives another depth of the forever told story. It has also brought a lot of fans to Ms. Austen.I've been quite a fan of Jane Austen's books for quite a long time and have gotten to see the most beloved version of this story with Colin Firth. To all of those who have seen this version I strongly recommend that you try not to compare MacFadyen to Firth (I mean how can you?). And take it for its own interpretation of the book. (Although I was bit mad that they left out certain characters.) But all in all I'd recommend this movie.	3.0	More Special Features...	2006-03-14	13	4	9
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A19BYWLK3FCWBC	Zaida Marcial	I recommend this movie to teenagers, young adults as well as older adults.  It's my one move I go to every time I'm down or I need to relax by myself or it's raining, snowing with a glass of milk and homemade chocolate chip cookies with my doggie by my side.It's a clean move, not too many movies out there that are just clean and innocent.  love it!!	5.0	recommend	2014-04-17	0	0	0

B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Z Hayes	I watched this 2005 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice some years ago and then forgot all about it. I guess I wasn't really paying attention to it, and decided to give it another go last night. Now, I am an ardent fan of the BBC adaptation starring Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet,Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996), and the other adaptation I have a fondness for is the one starring David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet,Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980). Both are faithful adaptations of the novel and I've worn out my DVDs watching them over and over whenever I have the time.This 2005 adaptation is a film version, so it is predictably an abridged version. It stars Keira Knightley (who does well in period dramas, e.g.The Duchess, andAtonement (Widescreen Edition)) as Elizabeth Bennet, and Matthew McFadyen as Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Long-suffering Mr. Bennet is played by Donald Sutherland, and Mrs. Bennet is played by Brenda Blethyn. The other daughters are played by Rosamund Pike (Jane), Jena Malone (Lydia), Carey Mulligan (Kitty), and Talulah Riley (Mary). Elizabeth's best friend, Charlotte Lucas is played by Claudie Blakley (who went on to do an amazing job as Emma Timmins in the beloved BBC series Lark Rise and Candleford.So how does this film version measure up to the full-length BBC series? There is truly no comparison. Many liberties have been taken with the storyline such that the essence of the story is there, but many of the finer nuances of Austen's writing and social commentary is quite lost in translation. Both Knightley and McFadyen deliver credible performances, though Knightley's giggly and bewildered looks do tend to get a tad tiresome after awhile. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are sufficiently adequate in their roles, but the actors portraying them fail to capture the true essence of these two ridiculous characters, especially in Mrs. Bennet's case. Jena Malone also fails to convince as the flirty, silly, and impulsive Lydia Bennet (she really can't compare to Julia Sawalha's infuriatingly convincing performance in the 1996 BBC adaptation). The actor portraying Mr. Collins delivered a tepid performance. Luckily his counterpart in the movie, Charlotte Lucas nee Collins as played by Blakley, is compelling. Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the snobbish wannabe mother-in-law to Darcy, is well-played by Dame Judi Dench (who never fails to deliver in any of her roles).Despite these flaws and the liberties taken with the plot, I did like this adaptation because of several things. The two leads beguile viewers with their strong chemistry. There's a sexual tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy that practically simmers on-screen and draws viewers in. The love-hate relationship and longing that is so evident is credibly portrayed by the two leads, each look, gesture, etc. The cinematography is breathtaking. When I first saw Pemberley in this movie, it just about took my breath away (though the Pemberley featured in the 1996 BBC adaptation will always be my favorite). My favorite outdoors scene in this movie was of Elizabeth standing on the cliffs with the haunting music playing the background...it was just transcendent! Then there's the amazing score. The music is so perfect for this period drama, and Dawn is one of my favorites. The music is memorable and can very well be a classic, just as the score to the 1996 BBC adaptation is.All in all, I was glad I watched this again, and will add this adaptation to my Pride and Prejudice collection.	3.0	3.5* - Many liberties taken here, but the chemistry between the leads sizzles!	2006-04-28	1	1	0
B00005JOHI	Pride &amp; Prejudice	AU61CID785ACB	Zuberdeen	"Okay, here's the deal: if you have read Pride and Prejudice and loved it, do NOT watch this movie unless you want to go on an unrewarding emotional journey: first you will hoot laughing, and then cry in despair,  and then become angry and hurl insults (and possibly rotten garbage) at your dvd player. If you are not a reader and are not a fan of Jane Austen, then you might find this somewhat amusing. I guess. I wouldn't know because I was so outraged by this ""adaptation."" I like to think of it more as an abomination, because that's what it is. The costumes are awful, the writer's and actors' interpretations of the characters is dreadful, and the whole thing is a hideous mess of a movie.Keira Knightley is fine in movies like ""Bend it Like Beckham"" and ""Pirates,"" but she cannot carry a true period drama. (By the way, is anyone else distracted by her mouth? It is CONSTANTLY open -- watch for it in ""Pirates"" as well). Darcy, Bingley, and the Bennett parents barely resemble the characters as Austen wrote them, and Wickham is hardly present! There is NO chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy either. Ugh, the whole thing is just terrible.Do yourself a favor and watch (or re-watch) the A&E; BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. Okay, so they made up the scene with Darcy at the pond, but it's a pardonable (and saucy) addition to an otherwise extremely faithful and beautiful rendition of Pride and Prejudice. If you haven't seen the BBC version, by all means skip the Keira Knightley debacle and go straight to the real thing!"	1.0	An Abomination	2007-08-13	67	48	19
