6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3HQ5CWXZJXF8J	Adam Platts	"""The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns"" ranks right up there among the best documentaries of all time.  Years after its initial release, the images, music, and voices still tell one of the most powerful American tales of civil discord and strife in US history.  The film can be utilized in a variety of educational settings ranging from classroom instruction to personal interest.  All Americans should know the story of how the US was divided over the issue of slavery, of how so many died fighting for what they believed in, and of how the Republic continued to stand as the last best hope of Earth.Review by: Adam Platts"	5.0	The Civil War - an excellent documentary.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3BWVS6VS7MXB3	"A. J. Vivolo ""A.J."""	"This particular series follows the civil war mainly from the perspective of the southern historian Shelby Foote. Mr. Foote has written extensively on the civil war, but has gone to great lengths to present the civil war as a conflict between ""states rights versus federal rights"" rather than the conflict between the economic model of southern plantation slavery versus northern wage workers. Great lengths are taken to white wash slavery and the extreme poverty of most southern whites. Battles and anecdotal stories are focused upon rather than the events that actually pertained to and promoted the conflict. Most of what made the civil war actually happen is not discussed. As with most histories that follow the lead of Mr. Foote, great lengths are taken to justify southern succession and uphold the southern way of life and southern slavery as some how noble."	2.0	Lacking in Depth	2013-08-02	3	0	3

It puts me there and gets me thinking how it was back then. I look at how things are today and the &#34;reasons&#34; we have conflicts and go to war. Back at that time, this country did establish itself and must have given hope to many around the world that people and governments can set things straight when they go off their original set of good goals and purpose. This country is or can be a good one again. We need take a look at what is the greatest good for all and work towards that. Then everyone, or most, around the world will benefit from it. What I mean is that every people should find what is right for them and work towards it but keep in mind that there are others out there and they should have that same right. The greatest good for the greatest number is what we all should work towards. We are capable  of doing that and we should.	5.0	This is how to tell history.	2013-06-26	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2V40R97RU5NAB	Allan W. Goodall	Ken Burns' Civil War is an excellent introduction to the period, told well with style. It's a documentary, not a history book. It is, however, far more accurate and balanced than other Civil War documentaries (such as the History Channel's Civil War Journal).To hit on a couple of criticisms in other reviews, slavery as a cause of the Civil War is an argument bordering on the level of a holy war, itself. Recent magazine articles and essays have done a good job of discussing it. The result is that both Burns' view and the &quot;Burns' is wrong, it was all about states rights&quot; views are both simplistic. Burns' documentary does a good job of capturing the Southern view of slavery and abolition but he does over state the view of the north as abolitionist. While there were Southern abolitionists and Southern soldiers who didn't care one way or another, Burns shows quite well that without slavery there would have been no war. (The statement that the South only fought for &quot;states rights&quot; was actually championed in the 1880s. If states rights were the only reason for fighting the war, why did the Confederate Constitution prevent any Confederate state from passing a law against slavery, even if that state wanted to abolish it?)To the point of Grant being the first Lt. General since Washington, Burns is both right and wrong. Winfield Scott was made Lt. General, but it was a brevet (something a little more than honorary) rank. It was a brevet specifically so that Washington would be the only man to have officially held that rank. This changed when Grant was given the rank.	5.0	Excellent Introduction	2001-10-31	7	3	4

The photographs that Ken Burns has found and the way he uses them tell the stories in ways never done before.  Add to that superb narration, excellent voice acting (including Sam Waterston, Morgan Freeman, Jason Robards, and many more), engaging historians, and a perfect soundtrack and this series is a must see.  This is Ken Burns at his best.  It's not perfect, and there are a few inaccuracies, but the power and emotion that is drawn out through this series is something everyone should experience.	5.0	The Absolute Best Civil War Documentary	2011-06-05	9	8	1

Just as a for instance, the details about the battle of Culp's Hill and also Picket's charge at Gettysburg and what about the where abouts and movements of general J.E.B. Stuart at that time. I jut feel that more time should have been given to this pivotal battle epic that lasted for several days. ALso if it had not been for the outstanding comentary contributions of Shelby Foote, this entire series would have fallen flat on its face.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AFDYHKAH8AJDT	A. Sloan	"I used to watch documentaries with my dad when I was growing up from time to time.  Being African American and from the deep deep South (both parents from the Atlanta area) we never really watched the ones having to do with the Civil War or Black perspective because they tended to be slanted one way or the other.  I never wanted to see those kind of documentaries and my parents had such pained expressions on their faces whenever something of that nature was on tv it just wasn't worth it to me.  Seeing as my parents lived such trying times day to day when they were growing up, I guess they could never be interested in other's views since they lived it.Both my parents passed unexpectedly 2 months apart from each other my mother dying after my father. (This documentary originally aired literally days after my fathers passing.)  I know I was in shock from his loss at that time otherwise I never would have watched, but since it reminded me of watching documentaries with my him I watched it.....then I became captivated.The presentation rang so true, because it wasn't just opinion from the modern viewpoint feeding us information from their own perspective. There were period photos, correspondence, diaries from actual people and Good Lord...the MUSIC was wonderful.  Things from North and South, White and Black woven throughout giving authenticity to the series. It was like a tapestry.  ALL sides were never ever presented as a whole to see why things were as they were.  Especially in such an eloquent manner. Although I in no way agree with why any Southern slave holders (not just White,  but there were Native American and Black as well) felt the way they did, I began to understand that this was all they knew since the time this country began. Slavery was not aggressively addressed then because it was too divisive.Because slavery was too painful to speak of it was never examined in my household. It truly changed me, I HAD to know more.  Then when the movie ""Glory"" came out on video shortly afterwards I was a goner.  I became a true Civil War buff.  This is honestly a truly perfect documentary that should have been named ""The Real Civil War"" God Bless you Ken Burns."	5.0	"""The Real Civil War"" !  Thank you Ken!"	2005-06-29	61	59	2
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AXSH6O4OP5L4M	"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen"""	"Hal, a friend of mine from work, and I have similar reading interests, so it didn't surprise me to find out that he knew far more than I did about the Civil War.  I'd  recently taken a short course on the subject, a period in history that had not heretofore interested  me in the slightest, and was enthused over the text for the class, Battle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson (for which see my review).  In sharing that excitement with him, I discovered his own knowledge in that area--he's a nurse with a degree in engineering and a wide range of reading interests--and he recommended the Ken Burns collection of videos, The Civil War.  I have to agree with him, it is an entertaining work.The interviews with Shelby Foote are, as Hal suggested they were, the highlight of the film.  They make it worth viewing even for someone not necessarily interested in the Civil War era, and they might conceivably enkindle further curiosity.  His laid back and genteel style of address, his thorough knowledge of and apparent impartiality for both sides in the conflict, and his delightfully anecdotal approach to the subject were a pleasure to both hear and view.  (In fact this first introduction to the gentleman encouraged me to find out more information about him, ..., which gives a short biography and a list of publications by and about the man, some of which are available through Amazon.)The film's approach to the Civil War is, as it must be, through still photos of the event.  This is the first war the ravages of which were caught on film to be presented to the public of the time and preserved for posterity, and the first time that this type of journalism brought the horrors and the true cost of the war to the American breakfast table as no other medium had yet been able.  Although the modern viewer, used as he/she is to the visual terror of real time attacks on the World Trade Towers and the Gulf War may find the style more awkward, those of us who followed the Viet Nam War through the photojournalism of the time will feel a sort of recognition.  The film presents a series of black and white photos of the war, of family keepsake photos of  individual soldiers, of paintings and photos of some of the heroes of the war, and of the carnage of various battles.  These are interwoven with video film of battlefields, buildings and memorials as they have been preserved today.  Giving a more personal touch to these pictorial documents are the recitations of material from personal diaries, letters, and family anecdotes given by notable actors like Colleen Dewhurst, Jeremy Irons, Morgan Freeman, Sam Waterston, among others.My favorites of these recitations are the diary entries of Mary Chestnut ( by Julie Harris), a woman born in the antebellum south, who chronicled the events of the war from the first battle at Fort Sumpter to the surrender of Lee.  She was the wife and the daughter of  US Senators from South Carolina and a personal friend of Varina and Jefferson Davis, so she had extensive knowledge not only of the events of the era but of their political and social ramifications as well.  She later published the condensed form of her very extensive diaries as a book entitled A Diary from Dixie ... The candor and insight of her observations as read in the Civil War by Ken Burns made me curious enough about her to add some of the books by and about her to my own wish list!A stunning film, full of information and visually arresting, it leads the viewer to find out more.  I would recommend it as a classroom aid to teaching a subject that is often neglected by students as ""boring!"""	5.0	A stunning film, full of information and visually arresting	2002-04-20	7	6	1

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	ADTGWOXJWWAY7	Ben Franklin	On this the 150th anniversary of the start of the Civil War, it seems appropriate to write a review of the most compelling and best made documentary of the Civil War in America.  From the strange accident of Wilmer McLean having the war start in his front yard and end in his front parlor, to the compelling prominent personalities of the war- Lincoln, Lee, Grant, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, Sherman, McClellan, et. al., to the soldiers in the field- Joshua Chamberlain, Elijah Hunt Rhodes, Sam Watkins, and the long list of historical figures that have become household names in American history, this documentary covers it all- and in compelling fashion.  The style of the documentary I think draws much from the late Shelby Foote, whoseThe Civil War: A Narrative (3 Vol. Set)is one of the best works on the Civil War ever written, and an excellent follow-up to those who like this documentary and would like to read more about it.  In any case, the personalities, the political issues, the problems, the set-backs, the terrible bloodshed, and the context of the war are all presented in compelling detail that really draws you in to the historical significance of the Civil War.The voices and, for the most part, the historians are all top-notch and help add drama and interest into the already compelling facts of the war, and make it a pleasure (if such a word can be used in context of the Civil War) to take in.Ken Burns deserves a lot of credit for taking on such an enormous task, assembling the voices, historians and data from thousands of sources- as the credits indeed show.  Such an incredible public service to the nation to keep this important chapter in our nations history alive in ways not really possible from a book in today's media age.  For the layman and even the more knowledgable historian, there is no better documentary of the Civil War than this one.	5.0	THE documentary on the Civil War	2011-04-12	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A20EEWWSFMZ1PN	"bernie ""xyzzy"""	"Ken Burns is noted for many find documentaries that leave little out and still keeps your attention. This time we get to set our ""way back"" machine to 1861 where we start with the cause of the Civil War. Now I know there are many causes for the Civil War as the one that I learned from my economics class was that it was economics. However, Kim Burns gives a more holistic look at what was happening at the time and the indicators that foretold of the war. Each chapter or section of this documentary is approximately an hour long we go through several titles such as ""A very Bloody Affair"" and ""Forever Free 1862"".What keeps this film from being a dry documentary is Ken Burns' balance between sounds and sights of the civil war re-created from sketches and extracted from books and drawings. To tie this together we get a talking head presentation from Shelby Foote. Shelby makes you feel like you are right there as he can describe in every detail any piece of the civil war that you care to ask about.One thing not to be overlooked is the voices in this presentation are those of popular actors. So be sure to watch the credits to find out whose voices are being used for which people are portrayed.I do not want to go into too much detail because that is why you are buying this documentary. However, it has something for everybody; for those that already know the Civil War it adds more depth and maybe a different spin on the politics and people of the time. This also works as one of the best introductions far superior to anything that I was able to receive in school history classes.This is also a must background reading for anybody in the military as everyone knows each war is different from the last but attitudes and sometimes knowledge of previous tactics can help carry you through the next.Even though the war is over while watching this documentary, you will find yourself kibitzing.Do not forget to buy the companion book to this film for contains many of the pictures and diagrams that were displayed so that you do not have to put the film back in to see this on the extras. Oh yes do not forget to look at the DVD extras.If like me you were fascinated with the presentation by Shelby Foote, do not forget to buy the three-volume set of civil war books, a narrative By Shelby Foote.The Civil War: An Illustrated HistoryThe Civil War: A Narrative (3 Volume Set)"	5.0	"Ken Burns opens some eyes and makes you feel ""You are there"""	2010-04-24	3	3	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AHCVWPLA1O4X8	bixodoido	This is probably the best documentary I've ever seen.  Yes, it's true, this film isn't the PERFECT guide to the Civil War, nor does it contain EVERYTHING you may want to know.  Is that so unreasonable?  I doubt it is possible to make a documentary containing ALL the important facts from the war, and even if one were made I doubt I'd want to watch it.  The point is:  this one comes darn close.At somewhere around twelve hours, this documentary is a serious time investment, yet it is one well made.  Never before have I seen the Civil War brought to life like this.  Never before have I experienced the sights and firsthand accounts of those associated with the war.The historians (with the exception of Shelby Foote) are somewhat corny, but Foote makes up for that as the picture-perfect Southern scholar who is loaded with anecdotes from and about the war.  Also, the documentary follows closely the lives of two men (one from each side) who started out as privates, kept journals, and somehow survived the duration of the war.  Besides these two mens' accounts there are many direct quotes from the generals and leaders involved in each of the major actions of the war.I agree that this isn't the definitive account of the war.  Shelby Foote couldn't do it in three (big) volumes, and I doubt anyone will.  Still, this is about as good as it gets.  If you're a Civil War or history buff I highly recommend this magnificent film by Ken Burns.	5.0	The Civil War comes to life	2002-12-03	5	5	0

Brother against brother, and our nation all in an uproar.States rights, self determnation, slavery, human rights, freedom.  People lead by those of influence, and power.  Many unclear as to what this conflict was about.  Though the wounds of which remain to this day, open.A must have for every History Buff, and a very good outline for American history.  One every Primary school student should embrace.  Even more we as Americans should also have these DVDs in our collection, that we may never forget, this tragic peroid in ""American History.""  Because history forgotten is history doomed to be repeated.  May we never forget.I love the narratives, photos and excerpts from the letters of the partisipants.  A war in such a time as that, which was frought with new inovations, and unfortunely increasingly effecient means of taking human lives.Dive into this docu. with an open mind, make note of the inventions,and advancements.  But make a point to pay attention to the tragic results, to all our citizens of this nation, then and now.

I recently made a visit to Franklin, Tennessee, and became tangled in the Civil War stories there.  After getting back home, I wanted to learn more about this fight between North & South.  The Civil War by Ken Burns is amazing!  I watched an episode a day and now I am even more hooked on learning Civil War history than I was before.  Until you see this film, you think the Civil War was just history.  It is not.  It is also our present and our future.  This is a great work.  I enjoyed Shelby Foote's commentary during the film so much that I think I will be purchasing his book &#34;The Civil War: A Narrative&#34;.  There is much more to learn about this war which defined our country.  I highly recommend this film as an excellent starting point!	5.0	Just watched and had to review!	2014-06-30	0	0	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	ADEJNRAT95LWV	"Bpollen ""bpollen"""	This series of nine parts is the best documentary ever made, IMO. Told through narration by historians and through actors reading real letters and journals of those involved puts the viewer right there, in the midst of it all. It was a long, complex war that resulted in the death and suffering of hundreds of thousands of our ancestors. The first hand accounts bring home the decisions made by the generals, by Lincoln, and the experiences of ordinary soldiers (some little more than boys), and the wives and girlfriends and mothers back home. Whether you like the intracacies of the battles or the personal human way the war affected individuals, it's all covered. Excellent. Make the kids watch, too! They'll thank you for it later.	5.0	Best Documentary Ever Made.	2014-04-15	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A37UST0CDS4ST7	Brian G. Ruschel	First off: I'm a Northerner.  I just think the Civil War and its history is a total con-job.  For example, you don't hear much about all the fortunes made by the draft dodgers (people who bought their way out).  And all the other unbelievable injustices.I've watched a lot of this on PBS and kept wondering how superficial it is.  I also never understood why Lincoln is considered so brilliant.  His writings are hickish, semi-illiterate, etc., and I've especially never understood what is so great about the Gettysburg Address.  Likewise, I never understood what was so brilliant about Grant.  Actually, the whole war was incometently handled by both sides.  And I kept wondering if there were secret attempts to negotiate a settlement, and whose fault it was that it wasn't settled earlier.I kept wondering about consequences of each death--realistic details.  For example, with all the Southern deaths, were Northern carpetbaggers buying up widows' properties, etc.?  Instead, there is always just generalized talk about carpetbaggers taking advantage of the new post-war poverty in the South.  But can we get some details about this poverty?  For example, did farmers borrow from banks, and they couldn't repay their loans?  And what about some details about business losses?This documentary is just a bunch of music, sounds, and thematic pictures.  Very little substance.  And I couldn't stand how the same photos of Lincoln, Lee, Grant, etc. are shown over and over and OVER again!	1.0	superficial	2011-04-07	128	15	113

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AD0A05GX5VV28	"Burly Nerd ""burlynerd"""	"Ken Burns' ""The Civil War"" has been nit-picked for various offenses of minutia in the reviews here.  Virtually none of the criticisms are worthy to deny the quality of this work.  Many seem to be the automatic criticism given to any work which achieves popular success.""The Civil War"" is an excellent introduction to this very important episode in American history.  It is presented to the viewer wrapped with several techniques that make the material more palatable to the viewers.The music is the primary technique that one encounters.  The ""Lorena"" theme that flows throughout the film is a hauntingly pleasant tune that provides continuity.  Other, appropriately-placed tunes provoke the emotions for the event being described.  This is a technique used in most films, but rarely done so well as in ""The Civil War"".The choice of narrators for the various characters in the war was also done remarkably well.  The slightly soft and solemn voice used for Robert E. Lee promoted the grand illusions that so many have for this very human and fallible man.  The main narrator for the film possessed a clear voice that was easy to listen to for long periods of time.Interesting, tangential elements like the 104-year-old lady added much to the watchability of the film.  She recited a poem from memory of such length that one wouldn't expect a person of advanced age to recall it.  Shelby Foote's occasional unexplainable humor was also interesting to watch.  He would recite some simple comment by a soldier and then chuckle about it, leaving you wondering how he had extracted so much humor from that simple statement.  It was quite amusing.Historical revisionists object to the portrayal of slavery in the movie.  In actuality, Burns didn't give much of a view of slavery at all.  However, slavery had such a key role in the war that it could not be concealed to the level that the revisionists desire.  While neither side in the war had emancipation as a major motivating factor initially, the slavery issue had a massive and overwhelming effect on the outcome.  Any less attention to slavery by Burns would have invalidated his work.  Slavery is an issue that many have tried to defuse, but none have been successful.  Now, they just try to historically conceal it.  Ken Burns' movie makes their job just a little more difficult.I could go on for some time about ""The Civil War"".  I have owned the set for some years and have watched it repeatedly.  There is a companion book that provides additional information, and references for further reading to cover parts of the war that could not be addressed in a movie of this length.  Being a long-time Civil War buff that has finally had the opportunity to live in Virginia where much of it happened, I am reading everything I can find about the subject and visiting battle sites.  This movie is one of my favorite sources of events that I can further investigate."	5.0	A most excellent introduction to a key piece of history	2002-09-16	21	20	1
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1VT3LYARBWKF5	Buyer beware	Ken Burns uses photographs, maps, documents and quotes to weave the history of the events of 1861 leading to the breaking apart of the Union.

This conflict is the central defining event of America.  The splits in the Civil War still exist today in American society and occasionally disrupt smooth politics.Ken Burns documents the Civil War in his epic film of the same name.  He focuses the war on the major actions (i.e. Vicksburg, vs. Port Hudson & the March to the Sea vs. the Trans-Mississippi Action).  He documents the war through a unique film-making way.  Instead of hiring re-enactors and other actors to play the scenes, instead he films the photographs of the war as well as sketches and paintings.The research needed to find the right photo for the right part of the war to convey the right meaning in the film must have been legion.This movie is truly the top in art.

Some of the historians who give commentary on the events discussed are very good indeed (f.ex. Shelby Foote), while others either have an ideological ax to grind, or insist on shoehorning their pet topic (f.ex., feminism) into everything they're asked to comment on, whether it's relevant at that particular point or not.  The accompanying music is superb (and I believe has been released separately, either as a CD or DVD).  If you have the patience to sit through all 10 episodes (not in a single sitting, though!), you'll learn a lot about the Civil War.  If you don't have that kind of patience . . . go to YouTube, and you'll find parody videos done in a &#34;Ken Burns' The Civil War&#34;-type style!  ;)	4.0	Classic series on defining period in our nation's history	2013-06-21	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2H3TGP5WIJNHK	"Center Man ""centerman@aol.com"""	"Everyone else has mentioned the power of this film, and it does give you an emotional left hook. The fact that power is conveyed mostly through still photographs means you're in the presence of a rare talent.  And it does focus on slavery as the cause, for the very good reason that it caused the war: the economic and state sovereignty issues that undergirded the Confederate States of America all sprang from the politics of human servitude.  No slaves, no war.Burns, though, hews very, very closely to the traditional telling of the Civil War as a conflict that occurred mainly in Virginia, with some other, minor battles in Tennessee and Mississippi.  The western campaigns matter only when Sherman comes on the stage, and for Burns they matter because Sherman is there.  Historians abandoned this approach three decades before ""The Civil War"" debuted, and today it looks even more archaic.Is this so bad?  I think it is.  It's a peculiarly myopic view,  which ""Lost Cause"" historians happily parroted in the 20s and 30s: the gallant and brilliant Southerners, fighting north of Richmond, held off the stubborn and brutal Yankees until the most brutal Yankee (Grant) put down the flower of chivalry with unapologetic, disgraceful butchery.  It gives Robert E. Lee a genius out of proportion to his abilities and downplays the military revolution in the Union Army, arguably the first fighting force of the modern era.The Union's superb organizational techniques came to the fore in the Western theater, where generals like Grant, Sherman and George Thomas, out of the Virginia spotlight, were free to operate, and had much more success.  With the exception of the Vicksburg campaign, Burns fails to convey this: he ignores the Army of Tennesee's invasion of Kentucky, he skips over the Tennesee campaigns (leaving Thomas, the war's best defensive general, a footnote in the process) and never adequately conveys the strategic manuevering of Sherman and Johnston north of Atlanta in the spring of 1864.So, will anyone besides a Civil War geek like me complain?  Probably not.  If Burns' documentary was all tactics, it wouldn't be as powerful.  But his approach here was repeated in ""Baseball"" and ""Jazz"": take a handful of colorful personalities to tell the story and trust them to tell it fully and completely.  As critics have noted, this translates into one field or one idea getting the face time, at the expense of others.  In ""Baseball,"" the 50s are almost exclusively devoted to the Yankees, Dodgers and Giants, as if baseball did not exist outside the Big Apple; in ""Jazz,"" Wynton Marsalis, a neo-traditionalist, gets to tell his version of Jazz, one reason the form's last 40 years get so little treatment.So it is with ""The Civil War:"" it's all about Virginia and the east.  Why?  Because Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is more telegenic than William Rosecrans, and his story had a happier ending.  For a story-teller, it makes sense.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1S3C5OFU508P3	Charles Ashbacher	As a child of the public school system of the United States and with children now in school, I can accurately state that the real history of the American civil war is not being taught. In general, students are told that it was largely about slavery and the rights of blacks. Nothing could be further from the truth. The abolitionist movement was rather small and some of the antiwar riots that took place in the North were due largely to the resentment of men who did not want to fight and die for the blacks. This and many other misconceptions are set straight in this film series.The causes and consequences of the war are presented in great detail, with an emphasis on historical accuracy. Even almost fifteen decades later, it is sad to watch the first episode and the events leading to the states seceding from the union. It is amazing to realize that there was still strong sentiment in most states for staying in the union. It is overstating to stay that the majority was pro-union, but it is accurate to say that the majority of white people in the Confederate States were not in favor of seceding in 1861.In the beginning very few thought the war would last more than a few months, and there were some who thought that it would end with a peaceful political settlement. William Tecumseh Sherman was considered unfit for duty when he stated that it would be a long and bloody fight. As the events unfold, one cannot help but draw comparisons with the events in Europe in August 1914. As the armies of Europe marched off to war waved on by cheering crowds, no one thought that it would end four years later with one side totally destroyed after horrendous slaughter.The civil war was the first war where massive citizen armies numbering in the hundreds of thousands clashed. In this tape you see scenes that could pass for what happened fifty years later in the fields of northwest France. Extensive fortifications of trenchworks, reinforced by barricades and stretching for miles. Dead men are left strewn across fields after leaving their fortifications to attack the enemy in their trenches. It amazes me to think that the Europeans repeated the American experience in world war one, somehow still believing that courage was strong enough to defeat armed men behind barricades.The course of the war leads many different ways, but most often union defeats at the hands of dashing, talented Confederate military leaders. George McClelland has to go down as the greatest example of arrogant ineptitude in American history. Had he acted with anything approaching the dash of Lee, the war could have been ended in the first year. So many things went wrong, and yet in the end, as long as no other country intervened, a union victory was assured.The conclusion put forward in the final tape is a bit overstated, but it is accurate. Before the war, the United States was a political entity where the emphasis was on the states. After the war was over, the emphasis was on the united, as it was the single event that forged a nation. No longer was a person first and foremost a Virginian or a Texan, forever more they would be an American from Texas or an American from Virginia.Despite years of reading about the civil war, I still learned many aspects of the war from this tape, The producers have created a documentary masterpiece that should be required viewing of all citizens, current and potential.	5.0	Superb film about the event that made America a nation	2002-06-21	26	24	2

I made the purchase immediately, it came literally 2 days later in very good condition. There are 5 DVD's, I played the first one...........it never loaded and after about two minutes came back with ""No Disc."" I put the second one in, it came back with the same message. The third disc worked, the fourth disc did not, then the 5th and last one worked. So I basically got 2 good discs and 3 bad ones, this was a real bummer because I wanted to watch this on my Memorial Weekend break and now have to schlep to the Post Office and mail it back for a refund, not even a replacement. This got 3 stars and I thought that was generous, but I am totally shocked this thing did not play and it isn't my player, just bad discs that have been sitting around for too long."	3.0	Great series, bummer when it arrived.	2011-05-27	6	3	3

Both my wife and I are Civil War buffs and jumped at the chance when we had the opportunity to move only a few minutes away from Gettysburg, PA.This 5 disc, 11 hour documentary uses narration, still photos (with the now famous ""Ken Burns Effect"" of moving along the image and creative use of sound effects), and historian interviews to cover every aspect, from the reasons for the war to the tragic events shortly afterward. The production quality is very high since this was made for PBS broadcast.While this is a documentary about a very bloody war (and there are plenty of disturbing images), the most memorable and touching segments are the personal stories told from the letters and diary entries from common soldiers and civilians on both sides of the Mason Dixon Line.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A378JZW2KKGJCR	Choices Unlimited	I have seen a number of people raving about Ken Burns' &quot;The Civil War&quot; who referred to this massive film simply as &quot;a documentary.&quot;  For anyone who has seen it &quot;The Civil War&quot; is not just a documentary, it is THE documentary.  To proclaim this magnificent set the greatest documentary of all time does not does &quot;The Civil War&quot; justice.A powerhouse of emotion, intelligence and ultimately a fascinating story brilliantly told, Ken Burns reinvented the documentary with a style of such grace and humanity that he lifted the entire medium to the level of high art.But &quot;The Civil War&quot; is so much more than just a documentary.  The film tells a story of the people and places shattered by a war that would so fracture an entire nation that it pitted brother against brother.  We see those fighting for honor, fighting for their way of life and some (eventually) even fighting for their very freedom and how this conflict intended to hold a nation together nearly destroyed it.  &quot;The Civil War&quot; is such a masterful piece of storytelling it is enough to make one wish all naratives -- non-fiction or fiction -- were this strong.The fact such a masterpiece came from television, the motion picture's much kicked around cousin, is besides the point.  T.V. show or not, &quot;The Civil War&quot; is the greatest movie of all time, period.	5.0	A Masterpiece Beyond Comparison	2001-07-16	0	0	0

Its voiceover actors are almost perfect for their roles and its talking heads, particularly Shelby Foote, are interesting and informative, coming in at just the right time.  Even though there isn't a battle recreation here, I got more of a feel of what the battles must have been like watching this than from any other Civil War documentary I've ever seen.  The subjects covered here are rather cliched; one would like to heard much more about things like the inner wars in east Tennessee and Missouri or the New York draft riots.  But this is still the best Civil War documentary available.Which isn't the compliment you'd think.  Because if you want to understand why the war happened, you won't find that out here.  Burns dedicates about half of one episode to the causes of the war, nowhere near enough time.  It took Allan Nevins 2,000 pages to get from 1848 to 1861.  Entire books have been written on the causes of the war, a topic Burns barely discusses.  There is next-to nothing here about the split in the Democratic party in the 1840's, the political controversy over Oregon and Texas, the battles over internal improvements which alienated the West, or even the Kansas- Nebraska Act, which led to the formation of the Republican Party.Burns' Civil War just kind of begins.  It would have been nice to know what brought it on.  If you want to know about Civil War battles, this is a good place to do it. If you want to understand the war, keep looking.	3.0	Good, but with one major fault	2001-01-02	69	43	26

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2KESMKX6BU6AB	C.J. LaPierre	"The Civil War deserves praise.  It brings history to life and arouses our interest in the events that have shaped the United States.  But there are two regrettable things about this film.  The first is in its grand portrayal of Robert E. Lee and the second is its disparaging portrayal of General Custer.  Robert E. Lee, no matter how dignified his personality or pensive his noble face, he was a traitor.  He made a decision to side with the Confederacy and the cause of slavery and division.  He was responsible for the slaughter of the very men who fought for Union, the United States and, ultimately, freedom from slavery.  He shouldn't be absolved because of his prayers for northern soldiers or his refusal to march in step with the cadets at Washington College after the war.  Even in the favorable light of this beautiful documentary, I can't get past the idea that he must have been an incredible egomaniac to fight to the bitter end for such a lost cause and to sacrifice so many lives along the way.  In regards to Custer, his real Civil War record tells a different story than what was portrayed in the film.  You really don't have to dig all that deep to uncover his heroism and the feats that inspired his men to follow him into battle after significant battle (try Margaret Merrington's ""Custer Story"").  His own memoirs indicate that he knew at some point that the real cause for which he fought was freedom and liberation of slaves not self-glory as the film alludes.  He might have had flashy uniforms but his men respected him because he was brave and he asked nothing that he wouldn't' do himself.  In fact, if a Civil War era Northerner could drop themselves into our time and watch this film, I think that they'd be baffled that one who fought so bravely for Union would be dismissed while the one who fought so doggedly against it would be elevated."	4.0	Robert E.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A18YMFFJW974QS	CKE	"Praise for Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" is truly endless. However, I have a story that I think will prove the greatness of ""The Civil War."" Recently, I was stuck grounded on a plane. A powerful thunderstorm caused the closing of the entire airport, and due to the lightning we were unable to leave the plane. We were stuck. It had been a very long week and I was very anxious to get home to my family so adding additional time on a sweltering plane was the last thing I wanted. I then remembered that I had myPhilips DCP851 8.5-Inch Portable DVD Player with Ipod Dockand the series ""The Civil War"" with me on the plane. The next thing I realize it was 2 1/2 hours later and I was annoyed by a tapping on my shoulder as flight attendant told me that I had to stow my electronics so that we could prepare to take off. I was annoyed.... I was so enamored by this min-series that I lost track of time and I had forgotten that I was sitting on a plane just outside of my gate (and no, I was not sitting in first class!). As we were taking off I realized that I had never watched ANYTHING that would have distracted me to that degree.What makes ""The Civil War"" such a mesmerizing experience? It really is almost too much to list, but I will try anyway.- The narration of David McCullough. It is amazing (to me) that such a talented Pulitzer Prized author could have a second career that may be better than his first! McCullough's voice is perfectly toned and adds both passion and knowledge to the narration. It is very clear that he is not simply reading from a script - this is a rare instance when the narrator has a deep and personal knowledge of the subject matter.- Shelby Foote.... Shelby Foote .... Shelby Foote ( author ofThe Civil War: A Narrative (3 Vol. Set). I can't imagine ""The Civil War"" without the commentary provided by Shelby Foote. It is like trying to imagine your right shoe without the left - it may look ok, but it just wouldn't work. Shelby Foote and his Mississippi draw was something to look forward to within the series. His commentary was not only insightful but it offered a sense of reality that is unmatched in other documentaries. It reminds me of listening to stories from a favorite uncle - one that had first-hand experience in the events and a flair for story-telling that keeps you on the edge-of-your-seat. Shelby Foote makes the entire mini-series feel personal and intimate. I could go on for days about his contribution to this documentary.- The soundtrack - The songAshokan Farewell: From ""The Civil War"" (Intermediate String Orchestra)is an inspired choice to be used as the underpinning of the story. Ashokan Farewell is truly haunting and emphasizes the melancholy of the entire series. While ""Ashokan Farewell"" may be the star of the soundtrack it certainly does not stand alone for its contribution. Again, Ken Burns is able to use music to weave together the narration, pictures, and the commentary to make a tight and engaging story.- The pictures and the use of ""The Ken Burns Effect"" - I guess by now this is to be expected by Ken Burns documentaries, but again in ""The Civil War"" it adds a stark realism about the people who participated and died in the conflict.- The story is balanced in a way that no one will agree 100% with the interpetation. For example, in the special features Shelby Foote admits that he feels that Burns focused too much on slavery. However, Shelby Foote has a southern bias so it is to be expected that he was not completely comfortable with that aspect of the documentary.Final Verdict - Should be required viewing by all Americans. Ken Burns is an outstanding director and producer, however ""The Civil War"" is truly inspired and it will likely remain the greatest documentary of our lifetime.5 Stars"	5.0	The best 11 hours I ever spent in front of a television	2010-06-27	6	6	0

And since in those days people wrote...diaries, letters, journals...there is the written record not just of the great leaders, the politicians and generals, but of the wives and sweethearts, the nurses and doctors, newspaper editors and farmers. Most of all there are the words of the soldiers. Burns shows the importance and the sweep of the war, but in part he does it through the lives of average people caught up in events they may not have completely comprehended, but which they believed in.If the words themselves have power, so do the voices. Burns recruited great voices, some actors, some not, to speak the words, distinctive voices that give great resonance to what we see. Julie Harris as Mary Chestnut, Charlie McDowell, a Virginia reporter, as Sam Watkins, Arthur Miller as William Sherman, Jason Robards as Grant, Studs Terkel as Benjamin Butler, Sam Waterston as Lincoln, and many others. He has David McCullough as the narrator. McCullough, an outstanding historian and writer, does a wonderful job. Burns also uses a number of historians to underline key points. Foremost, in my view, is Shelby Foote. Foote is the author of the epic three-volume Civil War. With his Southern accent, common sense and soft irony, he's a fascinating raconteur.The program is never dry or dull. It is gripping and emotional. Both sides felt they were fighting for a pure cause. What is particularly touching is that, as a people, we had not yet lost much of the capacity for simple, unadorned, unembarrassed feelings, whether it be patriotism for one's country or love for one's wife. I challenge anyone to read this letter from Sullivan Ballou, a 32-year-old soldier in the Union Army, to his 24-year-old wife, and not sit stunned with emotion. Ballou was killed in the first battle of Bull Run a week later.July 14, 1861Camp Clark, WashingtonMy very dear Sarah:The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days-perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write again, I feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more . . .I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans on the triumph of the Government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and sufferings of the Revolution. And I am willing-perfectly willing-to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt . . .Sarah my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me unresistibly on with all these chains to the battle field.The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them for so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when, God willing, we might still have lived and loved together, and seen our sons grown up to honorable manhood, around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me-perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar, that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battle field, it will whisper your name. Forgive my many faults and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often times been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness . . .But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the gladdest days and in the darkest nights . . . always, always, and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath, as the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by. Sarah do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again . . .--------------The program flows over 11 hours on five discs. In addition to the documentary, the discs are stuffed with background information...maps, documents, biographies and additional interviews. This is a superb production and is worth every penny."	5.0	One Of The Best Documentaries Ever Made	2005-08-09	512	498	14

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A185E7C28MZMNM	Conn MacEvilly	"There are only two contenders for the title: this series, and ""The World at War"". Buy both, as they are astounding examples of what TV can do as a medium. But if I were forced to make a choice, I would nominate this as the better of the two.The series is no tricky narrative or superficial dramatisation. It tells its story straight, accurately and well. But it is incredibly evocative of time and place.The voices of actors read the words of combatants, observers and commentators over a soundtrack of music from the era. Visuals are provided by contemporary photographs and beautifully-filmed moving shots of the landscape. The natural beauty of the land on which the battles were fought is powerfully evoked, while the faces of the men who fought there look back at us. Academics, especially Shelby Foote (whose Southern accent does much to give him an air of authority about his subject), provide description and anecdote.The effect is of a stately progression through the story of the first modern war, one that was sometimes noble, sometimes dreadful. There are moments that are harrowing, others that will inspire you.Sadly, there is no equivalent work on the history of my own country (Ireland). If there were, I would urge my own countrymen to see it. The true political and historical causes, course and consequences of the American civil war are things that every American should know about in depth. As is pointed out in the closing episode, before the civil war people would say ""The United States are ...""; since its end, we have said ""The United States is ..."". It is the story of the conflict that created the modern U.S. and arguably of the modern age. Watch this and you will gain an appreciation of it that will stand to you and inform your opinions about war - about why some are worth fighting and how a just war must be fought.You must see it."	5.0	Perhaps the best documentary series ever	2002-06-18	6	6	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A16DMCKV9RMQGI	"Continental Op ""philmarlowe39"""	"Ken Burns' eleven-hour epic brilliantly captures the tragedy of the American Civil War through folksy historians, celebrity voice-overs, searing photography, and the eloquent letters and diaries of everyday soldiers and civilians on both sides of the conflict.It has been said often enough that to truly understand the American spirit, one must study the U.S. Civil War.  In a four-year microcosm, the war summed up all the best in the United States.  Namely, the abolition of race-based chattel slavery, the vindication of democracy in a republican form of goverment in an era dominated by European monarchs, the incredible bravery of the Union and Confederate soldiers, and the sheer political and intellectual brilliance of men like Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.  Likewise, the war also displayed some of America's worst characteristics:  the vicious 1863 Draft Riots in New York City, the draft exemptions for the rich--both North and South, the 1864 massacre of 300 black Union soldiers by the Confederate army (and Robert E. Lee's refusal to stop similar racist carnage in the future), and Sherman's brutal campaign against civilians in Georgia and South Carolina.In eleven, sprawling hours, Burns and writer Geoffrey C. Ward capture the essence of the war and of the American spirit, and how the war united the country, but yet still divides it.  This is no small feat, and Burns' documentary is truly magnificent.That being said, Burns focuses just a little too much on slavery being the cause of the war (it wasn't).  The real cause was federal power versus state power.  Simply put, the South didn't think the North had any right to tell it what to do--and was convinced that the federal government was a stooge for Northern interests.  If you don't believe me, look to the fact that the U.S. nearly had a civil war over tariffs in the 1830s.  Ken Burns conveniently didn't put THAT in his documentary, but liberty and human freedom undoubtedly make a more compelling story than how much in tax you can charge to imported goods from France.  However, in all fairness, slavery (as well as Lincoln's election in 1860) was the straw the broke the camel's back (so to speak) and it was the preeminent moral and political issue of the mid-19th Century in America.The DVD extras are somewhat insightful.  Ken Burns himself comes across as a stale personality and isn't very interesting.  George Will calls the war ""the greatest war in history"".  Not true, I think the Persian Wars, Punic Wars, 30 Years War, Napoleonic Wars and World Wars I and II all outrank our civil war, but it's interesting fuel for debate.  The best interview is Stanley Crouch of the ""New York Daily News"" who gives a very candid view on the war and why Robert E. Lee is ""overrated""."	5.0	The definitive U.S. Civil War documentary	2002-11-23	2	2	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	In an age when almost none of our children knows the dates or even the decade of the American Civil War, an extended program like this is absolutely vital to give them at least some exposure to the war and some of the issues involved.  Is this series going to satisfy experts on the War?  No.  Is it comprehensive?  No, again.  But it is certainly more information than they get in their general history books at school.This series captured the public imagination for a lot of good reasons.  The use of contemporary photographs is done very effectively and lets most people see images of the War they had never seen before.  Hearing Shelby Foote and many other fine historians talk about the War is also interesting and informative.  Yes, it would be better to read the million words of Foote's narrative of the War and dozens of other books.  However, I doubt you will get most kids to do that and an effective mini-series like this could spark their interest to dig deeper.For all its limitations and simplifications of important issues, this is a terrific series and deserves to be in every home that has at least some interest in American history.  Every now and again I am able to get my kids to watch an episode or two to refresh their memory.  I am glad to have it on my shelf.	5.0	A great intro to the Civil War - especially for students	2004-01-13	7	7	0

I have become a history buff and it all really started here.  Its like Shelby Foote says, any real understanding of what the U.S. is is found in an understanding of the Civil War.  These videos grabbed my attention in 1990 and haven't let go.  Revisionist history?  I think not.  The cinematography itself consists of a series of period stills that Burns seems to make to come to life with the narration.  The narration consists of interviews with top Civil War historians/writers (i.e. Foote) mixed with exerts, beautifully narrated, straight from the pages of first-hand accounts such as the memoirs of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Sam Watkins, Elijah Hunt Rhodes, Whalt Whitman, Lee and Grant, and a host of others, most of which I was compelled to read for myself. There is little room for revisionism, even if there is still less room to fit all the stories in.  The documentary's simplicity is what makes it beautiful, its beauty is what makes it moving, and it can move anyone onto the path of great intellectual and historical discovery.	5.0	Nearly a full days viewing of delight.	2002-01-26	8	8	0

This is the perfect combination.  Burns has captured the epic nature of the War Between the States without pandering to a popular understanding of the events or spinning the facts, despite what detractors have said in certain reviews.Burns presents historical documents and personal correspondence with dignity and respect, but above all with power.  It may not tell the complete story of the war but it comes closer than anything else I have ever seen or read.As for documentary filmmaking, it will always be recorded as either &quot;pre-Burns&quot; or &quot;post-Burns.&quot;  This project has had that profound of an impact on the way documentary films are made, even to this day.This series is at the top of a very short list of films I will revisit regularly for years to come.	5.0	Both brilliant and ground-breaking	2003-10-06	13	12	1

I loved the experience, but it was difficult to find the time to watch more than one episode at a time (there are 9 episodes, 11 2/3 hours in total). Too many days would go by before getting back to the film, which surely lessened the total experience.That being said, I was continually amazed at how perfectly Ken Burns conveyed the feel of war and human loss, using only still pictures, sound and commentary.  It is a powerful statement about the human experience AND a statement about the ability of the human mind to absorb sounds and visual images and translate them into emotions and physical reactions.2013 is a particularly good year to see this masterpiece, given the battles now going on in Congress, the gridlocked and the political strife that each day pulls our Nation further apart.	5.0	Excellent film!

The nine tape  set is comprehensive and like Bruse Catton's, Shelby Foote's and  Time/Life's multivolume sets of books, all nine tapes are required to do  justice to all the battles, social issues, and great leaders which  comprised the Civil War. The tapes are made particularly interesting by the  inclusion of colorful commentators such as Shelby Foote and Ed Bearss. I  recommend a study of the War which includes both reading as well as video  presentaions and I believe this set is a great component of such a study.  There are other good multi tape sets such as the History Channel's  wonderful &quot;Civil War Journal.&quot; If you are buying just one,  however, the Burns masterpiece is the one to get. Also, whether or not you  intend to read one of the great histories of the war such as Foote's or  James McPherson's, you will do well to view this documentary.	5.0	A great Investment	2000-08-05	21	20	1

Mullins	"The most comprehensive and concise detail of the civil war ever produced by film maker, Ken Burns.This historical epic on the American Civil War is both informative and entertaining. I have wanted a copy of this production since I first watched it on Maryland PBS.As an amateur film maker I fully comprehend the enormous task that was undertaken in the production of this long past event brought to life by Ken Burns. His narration and the ""move on stills"" photographic work create the illusion of life in the old photographs used in the film.This production is a must for anyone interested in American history."	5.0	HIstorical Epic	2009-01-07	0	0	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1SG2T9V5MU34M	Davo	I have always believed that a superbly written script will trump a lot of on-screen action any day. This superbly written and narrated documentary proves the point. There are no filmed reenactment segments or dramatizations presented in the over ten hours of the story. The entire war is retold with gripping narrative, using actual still photographs taken at the time, interspersed with interviews from writer Shelby Foote and Historian Barbara Fields. Foote brings us in touch with the attitudes, anecdotes, sentiments and personal attributes of the key figures on both sides of the war. Fields expertly identifies the socio-political impact and outcomes that flowed from the decisions and milestones of the war. The sound track consists mostly of music from the period, played on the instruments available at the time. The music captures the complex moods - despair, fatalism, hope, profound loss, patriotism - that must have characterized this period in American history.I simply loved this documentary. It gave me a deeper appreciation of the price that was paid to have a nation such as ours and brought me in close touch with the horrors of war.	5.0	Just like being there...	2013-10-14	0	0	0

I am a Civil War buff and was afraid that this would be to fluffy compared with a solid history book and too anti-South as it is a PBS product.  Wrong on all counts.  It is a brilliant piece of work, moving, accurate, even-handed and comprehensive.  You will understand battles and strategies better than static maps in books can show.  I was moved to tears at times, especially by seeing the group shots of soldiers together before battle and some of the rare movie footage of old Civil War veterans in the 20th Century, including a very dignified gentleman with a white beard washing himself at a pump at a reunion, and you suddenly realize he only has one arm (watch for it).  You will be moved too even if you think you've seen it all.Minor gripe:  All land battles, too little non-military stuff (Confederate navy, diplomatic efforts in Europe, etc.) but these are flyspecks on an absolutely brilliant series.  You will never regret buying it but you will regret delaying if you put that pleasure off.	5.0	Buy this immediately and take your phone off the hook	2001-03-07	5	4	1

Burns does a great service to all those who took part in the war and the nation that was shaped by our ""greatest"" War. As Shelby Foote so wisely put it, ""It was a divide in the road and a hell of a divide it was"". (The War basically made us the Nation that we are for better or worse and I like to think for the better)The use of the old photos and the actual terrain by Burns was frankly brillant.It really helps one gets a feel for what it must of been like and what the people of the war thought and behaved.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AFT6HJ1ALIWZ2	"DeathfromAFar ""deathfromafar"""	It is difficult to use an adjective that has not been used already to describe this magnificent documentary series, but the one that springs to mind the most is elegent. Anyone, with an interest in military history, sociology, the history of the United states, or the making of the United States could not help but be captured by this great series.The series comes in three discs, with 3 episodes on each. The series essentually tells the histiry in a chronological order ( unlike, say the seminal &quot;world at war&quot; series which would deal with say, the bomber offensie from 1942-45), but each episode is broken into discrete chapters which cover an event of importance. Put another way, the terribly involved and complex war is broken into readilly digestable chunks, with a very smooth narrative flow. I am no expert on the Civil War ( although I do have some passing acquantence with 19th century warfare), but the scholership and research is sound.Noted historians, and particully Shelby Foote, explain in understandable terms- often illustrated by individual quotes and quips- matters of importance, and other events are narrated by beautiful- and I use that term deliberatly and dignified readings from speeches, diaries and letters from the period. MOrgan Freeman and Sam Waterstein are outstanding.Finally,, the graphics - colour film of the battlefield, old black and white film from the 1930's of a civil war vets reunion, and photographs from the period are superb. Finally the elegiac and moving musical score makes this a feast for the ears, eyes, and mind. An absolute gem, and most highly recommended.Grade: A+	5.0	Elegent	2002-12-25	2	2	0

What Burns has created is nothing less than a documentary masterpiece.  I personally have seen this entire film at least five times and I learn and see new things with each viewing.It is a feast for the eyes as well as the ears.  The entire film is filled with vintage photographs, Civil War era music, superb narration and the insights of those who lived through the war themselves.I have noticed a few minor factual errors in the film (i.e., Lincoln was 56 when he died, not 54), but they are few and certainly do not take away from the impact of this magnificent work.This one is definitely worth the money.

He made history live but he did so in a sensitive way. Ken Burns reviewed the script with a renowned group of Civil War historians before producing the series.

Very glad I did, for I find Burns' and Foote's works to be a fantastic educational companions.  Not only do I have a better sense of the chronology of the war, but I understand more of the impact the war had on the nation at the time, including the ways the conflict affected the rest of the world of the mid-19th century.

Lincoln has just been elected, and the South has officially launched its war for slavery (known as ""The Lost Cause"" among the toothless and inbred). A pack of yokels has gathered at the town square in Charleston, South Carolina, to rejoice, all of them yelpin' and hollerin' and just generally acting like a bunch of liquored-up jackals. By itself, this wouldn't warrant any notice (just another Sunday afternoon for your average Confederate), except that these reactionary ""rebels"" wield a curious implement: a yellow flag with a coiled snake on it accompanied by the words ""don't tread on me"" beneath it. As they wave their anti-government merit badge of hickdom from the tops of statues and buildings, undoubtedly drunk on moonshine, it dawns on you: the proud imbecility and backward provincialism of the Confederacy is still very much alive today, only now dispersed across the continent and concentrated in the suburbs of the major metropolitan (read, enlightened) areas. Maybe Ken Burns and his corporate backers didn't intend on highlighting this reality, but there it is. If you want to find the modern Confederacy, just follow the dumb yellow flags."	3.0	The South Shall Tantrum Again	2014-06-20	3	1	2
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1VWU58O9VNG5Z	DReese	For what is included, this documentary is good. The music is great, the stories by historians and authors, especially Shelby Foote, are wonderful, and the images are often haunting.My big problem with this, however, is the limited scope. Considering the length, I was expecting so much more. After watching this long documentary, one would believe that Americans fought each other in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvannia over whether or not to free the slaves. For shame! The civil war is so much more. Burns focuses primarily on the Armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginia, while in reality the war was won in the west. Battles of the east were the biggest in terms of numbers but the battles in the west, discussed but practically ignored, were more important. Ft. Donelson, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, and Atlanta are in there, but not given their proper due. Not a word is said about battles west of the Mississippi, the complicated issues of European involvement are ignored, the importance of blockade-running dismmissed, technological advanced glossed over, anti-war movements in North and South forgotten, and the causes of the war are treated with all the complexity of a fourth grade book report. Any cause not not DIRECTLY related to the abolition movement is completely ignored (but what would you expect from PBS).That all being said, I really enjoy watching this dvd. I just remember that it is VERY imcomplete.I once heard it said that a person's enjoyment of this series was inversely related to how much one knows of the Civil War. I found this to be true. As I study the war in greater detail, my tolerance for this documentary has declined.	3.0	Very good but limited	2003-08-15	18	15	3

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3N27L13CWJ9HY	D. R. Smith	"After watching over half of this movie all they were talking about was slavery, hence my title declaring the title of the movie false. When the title is ""The Civil War"" It should be about the civil war. To make a movie about the civil war would also require it to be a series as there were so many different battles and strategies in play by both sides. This is straight up false advertizing and not worth your time to watch if you want to see a movie or documentary about the Civil War. If you want to watch a documentary that gives basically the unions side of what starts the Civil War, then watch this. This is only about an hour and forty minutes long, and there is no way possible to describe the plight of the slaves, the issue of states rights, the secession of the southern states, the beginning of the war and all the battles that occurred and how they came to be battles and how they ended. The different strategies employed by both sides, the prisoner of war camps and the mistreatment of the prisoners on both sides. The Emancipation Proclamation and it's effects. The plight of the just freed slaves leaving the south and thinking everything was going to be all hunky dory when they made it across the Mason Dixon line, and finding out that the people of the north didn't really want them up there with them. They just wanted them freed from southern slave holders and expected them to stay in the south to make their living. Racism of course reared it's ugly head when Democrats, in the south mainly, started the KKK after the war and started killing republicans, both black and white. The story of the Civil War, and its ramifications, cannot be told in a mere hour and forty minutes. This just shows Ken Burn's view on slavery back in Civil War times. There are far better movies and documentaries, and also books, which do the Civil War far more justice. To give such a short sighted view of The War Between The States, is a grave injustice to the 600,000 men and women who died in this most terrible war in our nations short history."	1.0	Title is false	2013-01-21	45	7	38

Luckily, I was able to purchase this magnificent documentary, and I can tell you all that it is well worth the steep  purchase price.Ken Burns' artistic creation seems to be the standard by  which all other documentary films are judged.  It was a landmark film  disecting a very complex subject.  Using actors to read actual letters and  quoting dialog from the war's participants, while showing the viewer  startling photographs from the war, was a brilliant stroke.  And the  commentaries sprinkled throughout by the historians, especially Foote,  gleaned an insight not often found in documentary films, and brought  vividly to life the great battles and the terrible human cost that the  people of the era (both male and female / north and south) had  suffered.If one wants to see how our nation grew up and is the country  we have today, look no further than this epic as a starting point.  I would  also recommend the four-hour movie ""Gettysburg"", taken almost word-for-word  from the late Michael Shaara's pulitzer prize novel ""The Killer Angels"", as  a fine companion piece.""The Civil War"" documentary (nine video  tapes--approximately 15 hours of viewing time) is a fine beginning for  anyone thirsting for knowledge about our history.  Those interested in the  ""Old West"" may also get an insight, or at least an understanding, of where  some of the most notorious outlaws and lawmen sprang, and possibly why they  felt human life was so dirt-cheap.Between 1 and 10, ""The Civil War""  rates the highest level possible.  If films like these were available when  I was going to school, maybe I wouldn't have napped so often in history  class."	5.0	A must for anyone&#65533;s video collection.	2000-05-09	37	36	1
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2TXR85WQLE32N	D. S. Thurlow	"Ken Burns' absolutely superb documentary ""The Civil War"" may have been public television's finest broadcasting hours, now available in a DVD set.  Burns' unique mixture of photographs, period music, interviews with various historians, voiceover narrative by David McCullough, and excerpts from period letters and speeches creates a spell-binding effect for the viewer, whether dedicated student of history or general viewer.Burns takes the war chronologically, as a festering debate over the future of slavery becomes a civil war between the American states and a total war for the future of the country.  Although the series covers the fighting from Fort Sumpter to Appomattox, it is less a battle history than the story of nation undergoing a primal shaping event.  In Burns' hands, this catastrophic event becomes almost a lyrical epic poem, touching everything from high strategy to the impact of war on individual homes North and South.  A particular highlight is the commentary by Civil War historian Shelby Foote, whose wry observations provide perspective on the war.  Extra features in the DVD set detail the making of the documentary, along with some additional commentary.  Originally broadcast in 1990, the content of the documentary generally holds up pretty well.This DVD set is very highly recommended as superb entertainment and education."	5.0	Public Television's Finest Hours....	2008-03-17	3	3	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A6WYLA5ZTMFCR	Eagle Eye	"This documentary emphasizes why America's Civil War was also its most significant: it was a war of national self-definition.  We were fighting to define who we were and who we would be.The devastation of the war, with 600,000 Americans dead, the use of repeating guns and ironclad boats, and the Holocaust-like conditions at the Confederacy's ""Andersonville"" POW camp were some of the precursors to the horror of modern warfare.  It was total warfare, extending to civilians as Sherman's brutal march to the sea made clear.One weakness of this production is that it does not make the causes of the war explicit enough, and make clear that slavery on its own did not cause the war.  Abraham Lincoln himself had said at the beginning that if he could preserve the Union and free no slaves, he would do it.  Robert E. Lee did not support the institution of slavery, though he believed that whites were a superior race.  At the beginning, slavery was more a touchstone to conflict, an issue where deep-seated differences between north and south came to a head.  It was probably inevitable that northern society with its industrial base and ""classless"" society would clash with the agrarian South, which was built on a hierarchy of privilege, with white plantation owners at the top and black slaves and poor whites and the bottom.  With the North's economic progress came southern anxieties about the growth in the federal government's power and what that meant.  Could the federal government override the ability of new states to decide if they were to be free or slave states?  The states that would make up the Confederacy said no.The profiles of the major players in the war, Lincoln, Lee, Grant, McClellan, Sherman, Stonewall Jackson and others, as well as the correspondence of rank and file soldiers, brings out the humanity of the conflict.Its wounds remain.  I once knew a descendent of Robert E. Lee, who carried himself with a sense of honor and grace that seems to have almost completely disappeared from our national life.  He'd get choked up talking about the ""War between the States.""  It is hard to understand how Robert E. Lee, someone of such outstanding character, could allow himself to be so blind to racial injustice.  But that famous Mathew Brady photograph of him standing outside Appomatox Courthouse after the surrender, depicted in this documentary,  shows his noble bearing.  In his own way, Lee depicted those qualities so lacking in our political and social life these days:  duty and honor.This documentary brought home the Civil War's devastation.  It helped me understand more about who we are as Americans."	5.0	A War to Define Ourselves	2006-08-14	19	17	2

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A9L6L5H9BPEBO	Edwin C. Pauzer	"This five DVD series provides a detailed account of the most tragic war in American history, the Civl War which claimed more lives than all of our wars combined. Narrated superbly by David McCullough, who would later narrate the film, ""Seabiscuit,"" the viewer is led through the events before the conflict to fifty years after the Battle of Gettysburg when veterans met again as friends rather than enemies. The last one would die in 1959.  The diaries of soldiers, civilians, and leaders of both sides are reread by such prominent actors as John Waterston, Jason Robards, Julie Harris, Jeremy Irons, Derek Jacobi, George Plimpton, and Morgan Freeman. Actual civil war photographs are interspersed with modern photography of the places where they fell or suffered the misery of bivouac and deprivation. Sounds of musketry, commands and rebel yells often provide background audio that makes the viewer feel as though he or she is there.As the stories are told to us, music of the era provides a background that adds to the realism of the time. It will replay in your ear many times over. ""Dixie"" and ""The Bonnie Blue Flag"" were southern favorites. Another favorite would be written by a lady who suddenly awoke in the middle of the night to pen a poem that would be set to an old Methodist melody. It would become the ""Battle Hymn of the Republic.""Nuance and coincidence are thick and so frequent in this series it is impossible to catalogue all of them here. At the first Battle of Bull Run, Wilmer McClain, a farmer decided his home and family were too close to the war. He would move them into western Virginia where four years later, Robert E. Lee would surrender to Ulysses S. Grant in the parlor of the farmer's new home. ""Dixe"" was written by a Northerner. Union forces named battles after rivers or creeks, while Southerners named them after towns. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, a college professor from Maine, found the only way he could be released from his teaching post to fight was to go on sabbatical. As colonel, of the 20th Maine, he would hold and defend the most pivotal position of the battle of Gettysburg, the most important battle of the war, and he understood both at that moment. His regiment of fishermen from Presque Isle ME would face farmers from Talledega, AL.  Drawing a straight line to both communities found Gettysburg on the line, 650 miles apart from each. A failed officer, drunk, and store clerk would end up leading the US Army. His name was Ulysses S. Grant. Robert E. Lee, was offered command of the U.S. Army, but refused. He would not take up arms against his state. A Confederate officer would capture and board a Union vessel where he would cradle a dying Union lieutenant in his arms, his own son. When President Lincoln orders a new cemetery for the fallen, the Quartermaster General, Major General Montgomery Meggs brings it to the front door of Robert E. Lee's home. Within a year his son will be interred in Mrs. Lee's rose garden. It would later be known as Arlington National Cemetery. Two brothers would meet on the battlefield of Gettysburg, one fighting for the South and the other for the North. After the war, the state of Mississippi would spend one fifth of its budget on prothesis for their veterans. Elijah Hunt Rhodes would rise from the rank of private to general and would meet with veterans for years after the war as Major General Chamberlain would. Confederate Nathan Bedford Forrest would also rise from private to general becoming one of the most feared cavalry raiders of the war. His tactics and phrases would become doctrine of the army to this day. ""When surrounded, attack"" or ""Keep up the scare."" Ironclad ships would make their debut and make every navy in the world suddenly obsolete. Abraham Lincoln would be invited to say a ""few appropriate remarks"" at the dedication of the Gettysburg Cemetery on November 19, 1863. His two minutes of 272 words would forever be remembered as ""Lincoln's Gettysburg Address,"" and it would become the most memorable in American history. The two-hour long speech of 14,000 words by the featured speaker, Senator Edward Everett of Massachusetts would be forgotten. Only his kind telegam to Lincoln, a day later would be remembered, ""I would like to flatter myself that I came to the central point in two hours as you did in two minutes."" In the greatest irony of all, the rebellious Confederacy would have rampant inflation making the U.S. gold dollar, the most valuable currency they could possess.What makes this documentary  so effective is that doesn't look or sound like one. Ken Burns has proven to be a master at this. He has shown how our civil war has had such a profound effect on the American pysche. ""Ashikan Farewell"" written in 1963 in upstate New York, is frequently played throughout the story. It has become a favorite at weddings, anniversaries and funerals across America, and is forever linked indelibly to this story. The sounds of commands, horses, and musketfire add to the realism of this production. Historians Shelby Foote, Edwin Bearss, Barbara Fields, Stephen B. Oates, and James Symington, a former congressman bring to life untold personal accounts of those long dead so well, you think they had been there. The true power of a DVD of this stature is that it makes you think and want to learn more. It's power is that you may never tire of watching it.The actual Civil War defined a nation for people from the North and South, and it continues to this day. Even though it is an event of yesteryear it can no more be separated from us than we could be separated from our own skin. It reveals the resilience and genius of our Constitution. Not a single word is changed because of it.  The United States becomes the first nation to have a civil war over slavery, and the first to have elections during one. Before the war, the United States was described in the plural, are. After the war, it was the ""United States is,"" and it has been ever since.November 11, 2009: For our veterans, North and South, past and present."	5.0	Moving and Brilliant Beyond Words	2009-11-11	4	4	0

The Civil War is one of my favorite time periods in United States history and I felt these movies did a decent job of retelling it. I've read a couple other reviews from people saying that it only really showed the Northern POV and I have to admit that yes it does lean heavily that way. However and I'm sorry I feel the need to point this out but the North won and history is written by the victors so it makes sense to have a predominately Northern view. I'd also like to point out that it's not called The &#34;Complete&#34; Civil War - A film by Ken Burns.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AZB4CQ9JZSUQB	Eric Pregosin	"Well after 12 years, Ken Burns' miniseries that started it all, The Civil War is finally hitting DVD. For those of you who enjoyed his other longies like Baseball, Jazz and New York, or even his 2 parters like Mark Twain, Thomas Jefferson or Lewis and Clark, you will love this. This is the perfect film for History buffs and Non-History buffs alike. There are things that you don't read in the books in this series. For example, I've been to Gettysburg and I've read Mackinlay Kantor's book found in library kid's sections for ages. I know that when General Sickles accidently left Little Round Top unguarded On July 2, 1863, that a young General G.K. Warren saw the situation and called for a division to get into place, and there is a statue on Little Round Top to his memory. What I didn't know was that division was commanded by Maine professor Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and it was his ""unlikely textbook maneuver"" as David McCullough puts it that helped keep the Round Tops from falling into the hands of the Confederates. Whether you're a Civil War buff like me or not, you learn something new every day. This DVD set will be a welcome addition alongside not only my DVD copy of Baseball, but also ""Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided"" which aired on American Experience last year and is also narrated by McCullough. Like Baseball it has a gallery of names doing the voice overs, Sam Waterston, Garrison Keillor, Morgan Freeman, Jason Robards, Julie Christie, Studs Turkel, Charley McDowell and more. UPDATE 10/12/02: I just got my copy this morning. It is time to express my kudos to the manufacturer (for an example of this see my review on The Prisoner Mega Set). Back in 1990 when PBS video first released this series on 9 VHS tapes, the copy of episode 2 was partially cut. After David McCullough's last narration which foreshadows the Battle of Antietam (which will appear in episode 3) on the televised copy, Morgan Freeman gives what I think is the best of his Frederick Douglass voice overs of the entire series. On the pre recorded VHS of Episode 2 that was released in 1990, this last but touching segment of that episode was cut (even though the booklet that came in that slipcase accounts for it). The series was re-released on VHS with help from Turner Home Entertainment in 1994 around the time of the release of Burns' next mega hit ""Baseball"" and re-released again at least once more since, but I do not know of this was rectified at that time (you may email me if you have one of these sets, and you know if it was fixed there). Well I can't speak for the NEW 5 VHS set, but as for the DVDs, justice has been finally served. The missing clips HAVE BEEN RESTORED. So kudos to the folks at Warner Home Video (who co-released the set) and to someone at PBS Video for taking my phone call a few years ago seriously when I mentioned this injustice. After 12 years, Ken Burns epic The Civil War is preserved in a format that will live forever, a set of DVDs you always remember (and watch over and over, like me) about a time our nation can never forget.

Yes, this show has great content. But for the life of me, I cant understand how Ken Burns let this one go through. Normally PBS/Ken Burns titles are pretty good but this DVD has the worst telecine wobble I have ever come across. It is ****VERY **** distracting. FYI:When film is transferred to video, it is done by a telecine machine. This is a machine that is fundamentally a modified movie projector, but instead of projecting the film image onto a screen, the film is projected onto a device which converts the film image into a form suitable for processing into video.The film is moved through the telecine machine mechanically. If the mechanics of the telecine machine are not precisely set up, the film can weave backwards and forwards as it passes through the machine, with the result that the final video image wobbles from side-to-side as well.I would give 5 stars for content, but I'm only giving 1 star for lousy the DVD transfer.	1.0	Worst Telecine Wobble Ever	2004-04-02	49	24	25

Read their words, feel their passion not some one trying to be ""a story teller"".  I read several other reviews about this film by people gushing over Mr. Burns like he was some sort of History god. .... I disagree sharply with some of his reviews and ideas about the Civil War but he does open doors that ""story tellers"" would rather keep closed.I too, as the Southerners did, fought in a losing war and came home to half a country that hated me for standing up for my ideals,honor and duty. People have been trying to take that from the South for over 130 years. I know I sound like a Southernerbut my sympathys lie with men in the blue uniforms. Born a Yankee and always a Yankee.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3RDOWCVJ6UZTW	geemmm	The pace, the mood, the soundtrack, the narrators make up for the lack of motion cinema.It's actually quite beautiful. I didn't want it to end. What an artful way to piece history together.That and all the other positive raves you don't need to hear from me again.The downside of the documentary is almost it's upside.What I wish this documentary would have gone on to do -and history may be lacking-was portray Lincoln's vision for the country after the Civil War, how he meant to heal the countryafter those 4 grueling years. This would enhance the loss of Lincoln to the nation andexplain why, while slavery ended, the civil war ended, racism continued for a hundred more years.In addition to that, the South's reaction to Lincoln's death was omitted.I don't know if it was because the south today is mostly Republican, and it mightoffend those viewers to know that side of their history.But it is crucial for people to know just how cruel they were towards Lincolnin the South, their reaction to his assassination;how cruel they were to blacks in the South, another omission.By failing to convey the harsh realities of the time, not just the war,history loses it's ability to teach the proper lessons.While the documentary was about the Civil War, 15 - 30 minutes could have been addedto describe the true conditions for the blacks and what slavery actually meant; adding too,the mentality and philosophies of the slave-owner.By understanding these concepts, a viewer would be less prone to sentimentalizethe rebel flag, General Lee or Grant, the times or the war, what so many people do even today.I found myself doing exactly that, sentimentalizing things I shouldn't.The South seceding was all about slaves and discrimination. That africans were not consideredhuman. How this country ever rationalized slavery is one of it's greatest sins.So the documentary should have added more spotlight on the issue.None of the above should stop you from enjoying the work, but caution yourself.It really needed to go the extra mile, and it's too bad they did not.	4.0	Excellent Piece of Narrative History, with a few cautions	2011-05-17	2	0	2

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AK7D1BHZOSOL1	General Pete	Very good yes it does lean a little to heavily on the eastern theater of the war and yes depending on ones point of view it leans too heavily on slavery as a cause for the war.  However slavery was a cause of the war weather you want to believe that or not.  Also there has been some criticism that Ken Burns only focused on the parts that he would want to focus on well to those people I say make your own documentary.It also makes clever use of several things1.  Photographs thereby putting a face on all of these people.  Too often these civil war documentaries focus to much on the movement of the armies it does not capture the attention or the imagination of the audience as much as a face can.2.  Shelby Foote who isn't just some random historian blowing hot air he actually knows this stuff.3.  The celebrity voices are excellent as well Garyison Kyler and Morgan Freeman just to name a few.Overall-I could go on for hours but the most important thing you could do if you want to understand the Civil War is watch this documentary.  You will find that the Civil War is not a simple story of good guys and bad guys but a more complicated situation with men of principle on both sides.	5.0	One of the finest documentaries ever produced	2007-10-22	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AC6IPDPPXGUZR	Geoffrey Woollard	Regardless of historical reservations and allegations of bias from both North and South, I regard this work of Ken Burns as a true masterpiece. I bought my first set on VHS several years ago at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and played it through a dozen or more times. I went to the expense of having this set transferred to new tapes for my VHS player here in England. Having heard in 2002 that it was available on DVD and that the whole series had been digitally enhanced, I purchased the same and I can vouch for its much improved picture quality. I have played the DVD series several times, too, and I never tire of it (nor of the separate music CD, which is one of my all-time favourites).Why do I love the series? Well, despite (as I have said) historical reservations on my part and allegations of bias from both North and South (as I have read), Mr Burns has gathered together over many years the most remarkable collection of old still pictures, interviews with such as the superb Shelby Foote, extremely beautiful modern scenery film footage and stills, inimitable commentary by David McCullough, and, most especially, ancient film footage of such as the reunion of veterans at Gettysburg in 1938 (the last mentioned brings tears to my eyes to this day). Mr Burns has made a wonderful whole of wonderful parts and has done a wonderfully impressive technical job.And my historical reservations? Well, I am British and, in a British tradition dating from well before the American 'Civil War' or 'The War for Southern Independence,' I am a Southern sympathiser. I feel 'at home' when visiting such as Virginia to this day and I regret very much the loss of much of what went with the dreadful wind from the North of 1861 - 1865. I have many Yankee friends but we mostly steer clear of discussion of the Northern aggression under the appalling law-bender Lincoln and the religious hypocrites at his back. I tend, therefore, not to believe any medium that portrays the old Southerners as other than victims. This magnificent video or DVD set does not do this: it makes an attempt at balance - maybe successfully, maybe not.Thankfully, the South has 'risen' again in a manner of speaking, but it's a shame that more than a century and so many lives were lost by succeeding and successive generations of Dixie's people.Having got that off my British chest, I urge those who have not seen the PBS TV series, the VHS videos or the DVD set to rush out and get them/it. Of course, you don't need to rush out: just order the lot from my friends at Amazon!	5.0	A true masterpiece, regardless of historical reservations!	2007-08-25	3	3	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2MNB9PF4QMK9P	"givbatam3 ""givbatam3"""	"Ken Burns did a magnificent job making a multi-hourproduction using archival still photography and stillmaking it interesting to the viewer with no backgroundin the Civil War.  However, as other reviewers havepointed out, political correctness does take its toll.A good example is the way General George McClellan istreated.  Although it is pointed out that he builtthe Union's Army of the Potomac from scratch and thathis men loved him, he is presented by Burns, who oversimplifies the War as being a crusade to ""free the slaves"", as being something of a cross between a traitor and coward for not pushing his clear superiority during the Peninsular Campaign.The way this crucial attempt by the Union to captureRichmond early in the war is portrayed leaves the viewerpuzzled as to why McClennan decided to call off theoffensive in spite of having won several battles.Burns implies that McClennan didn't really believein the cause and was looking for an excuse to backout it.  Further investigation on my part has revealedthat McClennan had very poor information about thestrength and intentions of the enemy and was workingunder immense pressure from the political echelonsback in Washington which interfered in the militarydecision-making process. It is unclear that anyother commander would have had any more success.What is particularly interesting is that historianShelby Foote who appears in the series defends McClennanin his famous history of the Civil War so apparentlyhe didn't have that much input.  The fact is that theUnion wasn't able to really decisively defeat theConfederacy until it found a General, U S Grant, whowas willing to go all the way with a war of attritionand accept high casualties in order to gain victory.On the other hand, obscure aspects of the war arebrought out that are not really dealt with in othersources.  One good example is the series destroysthe myth of the ""united South"" pointing out that therewas tremendous opposition to secession.  Even in a""Deep South"" state like Alabama, only 55% of the populationvoted for secession in a plebescite.

I was reading Shelby Foote's three volume set of books ""The Civil War"", and bought the DVDs to view after I finished the books. The books are unsurpassed, and the DVDs make a perfect accompaniment to them. They provide many period photographs, which are not available in the books. And they also trace the war from beginning to end through the writings of several participants and observers of the war. The narration is excellent, Foote's comments insightful and very helpful, and the character voiceovers are too.I am thoroughly impressed with both products, and would recommend them without reservation."	5.0	Superb!	2007-12-28	1	1	0

I was not disappointed.Over the years, I have read various reviews about the fairness/objectivity of the accounts -- I have found it to be fair.

Davis personal writingsof all the problems he had dealing with the other confederate states, issues that Lincoln didn't have (and he knew it andwas envious of Lincoln) you can see that the war was lost as long as the confederate states were all going in differentdirections and then after the war ended they blamed him for losing the war.

Casteel"""	"I was very hesitant to write this review; because, no matter how much I happen to like or dislike something I've bought on Amazon, it seems like a waste of time and effort for me to post a review unless I feel like I have something of value to say about it beyond just a simple ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"".  And I don't really feel particularly moved to say anything about this wonderful documentary series apart from the fact that I really liked it.  (So, I guess that would be a ""thumbs up"" from me, then.)  After all, this series originally aired more than two decades ago, has been seen by millions of people, and is now rightly regarded as a national treasure.  What more can I say about it than has already been said by countless others over the years?  It's a brilliant piece of documentary filmmaking.  It manages to be both entertaining and educational throughout.  It is very moving in places.  It really gives you a sense of what the Civil War was like for the soldiers who fought in it, as well as for the noncombatants who lived through it.  It brings the historical figures of the Civil War -- Lincoln, Grant, Sherman, McClellan, Davis, Lee, Jackson, Forrest, Booth, et al. -- to life, showing them as real human beings rather than as icons of legend.  It features the amazing storyteller and Civil War expert, Shelby Foote (1916-2005), who I would gladly listen to for hours on end.  He talked about the war as if he had been there.  Now I want to read everything he ever wrote about the Civil War.  And, last but not least, this documentary series had some really beautiful music -- especially the theme tune for the series, ""Ashokan Farewell"", which I can't get out of my head.  But all of this has been said before, and said better, by others.  I just don't seem to have anything original to add.  I wish I did; but the muse just doesn't seem to be cooperating.  So why post this review at all?  Because Ken Burns' ""The Civil War"" is so good that I felt the need to add one more five-star review to its tally as a show of support.  Sorry I wasn't able to do more."	5.0	Five stars is the least I can give it	2012-05-20	3	3	0

It is by no means all inclusive, but for the average individual, all they will ever need to know.  I would recommend the companion book along with it.  It does have some mild undertones of today's general and liberal beliefs laced into it, ie.it seems to be impossible for 20th and 21th century people to completely understand that people actually had different beliefs and idea in centuries gone by, but it is to be expected any more and doesn't hurt the final result.	5.0	Excellent	2003-10-15	3	1	2

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1MAG8BDOVJHTT	"G. Swift ""97jedi"""	As with most DVDs, I will comment but little on the actual content of the film, but I have to say that even after twenty years, this is still the finest example of filmmaking to have come from PBS if not from any other source as well. More than once in the viewing was I moved to tears at the remembrances of the bravery, the salutes to the fallen, and the grief and triumph of a nation sundered and made whole. Combining period photographs, modern video, and voiceovers with both, Burns provides an overview of the war from the earliest days of Lincoln's political career through the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg when a few dozen survivors gathered together to celebrate their comradeship across the years and the sides.The DVD transfer is exceptional, though the coloring in some of the old photographs is a little incongruous. The voiceover work is also well carried over, being better than the original print. Sam Waterston's voice still does not work as Lincoln, sadly, especially his poor reading of the Gettysburg Address. Morgan Freeman as various black personages, most especially Fredrick Douglas, is the class of the group, with numerous well-known (though some now passed on) luminaries with distinct voices lending their talents. The narration is superb and the interviews with hitorians wonderful.Most lacking, and a terrible oversight with things seemingly being easy to produce in these days, is the lack of subtitles. The hearing impaired would surely appreciate being able to view the program with a text readout of the voiceovers which are the entirety of the film. The cover art of the current set is abbreviated from that of the displayed photo, since the slimmer packaging has a narrower spine. Otherwise, this is the best DVD purchase for anyone interested in a terrific grounding in the Civil War. From it are many sources and references to lead one into numerous other directions, whether from visiting historical societies or locating the memoirs of those who lived through the conflict.	4.0	Unparalleled	2010-11-01	6	4	2

The Battle of Nashville, December 1864 was, perhaps, the greatest victory in the war,  greater even then any of Lee's. After Atlanta Sherman stripped Thomas of veteran formations, bridging equipment and cavalry and sent Thomas to Nashville to protect it from John Bell Hood's Army of Tennessee. Thomas also had to contend with constant interference and intrigues from Halleck, Grant and Sherman. Thomas' complete attention to training, logistics and planning destroyed Hood's army and cemented Union control of the West.	4.0	"Good, but follows the ""accepted"" story of the war"	2014-03-25	1	1	0

The only thing better than knowing that was receiving this set for Christmas.  I was a very good boy last year, and I love Santa.The thing that I've noticed is that these still pictures sometimes wobble ever so slightly.  I never noticed that with the VHS version, because the picture on VHS isn't as great as that of the DVD.  Apparently the camera wiggled just an eyelash' worth from time to time, probably due to movements of the photographer or others in the room at the time.I offer that as an observation, not as a criticism.  I have no regrets having this DVD edition, and highly recommend it to pretty much everyone.I would have appreciated additional material (perhaps a short documentary) about the backlash against the original broadcast, and the responses to that backlash.  If anything, the series bent over backwards to examine the role of slavery as ""the inciting cause"", the role played by women, etc.While I would prefer to have seen a bit more axe-grinding, such as concerning the incompetence of Ambrose Burnside, demonstrated at Fredricksburg, Antietam, Peterborough, and elsewhere, or Robert E Lee's complete lack of major victories (other than Grant's blunder at Cold Harbor) after the death of ""Stonewall"" Jackson, I can't complain about this series.  The script is great, the narrator was the perfect choice, and the various talking heads edify and educate.  The use of hundreds of Civil War era still photos is something that doesn't call attention to itself.  The show is remarkable._The Civil War_ should be enough to induce interest among those (particularly kids) who don't know much about it, or haven't even heard about it, and as far as I'm concerned, this should be shown in every elementary school classroom, bit by bit, in the post-lunch break cool down.  There are any number of books about SNAFUs of the Civil War for those interested in more in depth history.On the one hand there is the ""what if"" ideas seen in some books, particularly regarding lost victories and the like.  Those are often derided by the less plausible ""foregone conclusion"" school who frankly have their heads stuck up their rears.Burns and company in taking the middle way produced the best TV series ever broadcast.

The historical portrayal of events are less than satisfactory.  Too much emotionalism is inserted into the presentation.  The dates and places are correct, however, there is a great loss here as the actual history of the conflict is not accurately potrayed.  The Confederacy is portrayed as a ravenous gentleman clinging to his traditions and wealth, while the U.S. are pure-hearted crusaders with a limited attention span.  The high points of the film include the many diary entries and letters of the times.  The conflict of the war is presented as an equal to ""human rights"" issues.  I would imagine if Ken Burns presented a ""documentary"" on Operation Iraqi Freedom the terrorists would be ""resistance fighters""."	3.0	Emotional History	2004-10-20	20	9	11

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AL5OEDM8TPTKV	James Hiller	It's hard to believe that this epic documentary on America's greatest defining war is more than ten years old now. Back in th early 90's, I don't think Americans were quite prepared for the deep and lasting impact that Ken Burn's &quot;The Civil War&quot; would have on them and on our nation. The impact returns, it all of its amazing glory, in the reissue of it on DVD.Watching this is like revisiting an old friend, and meeting a new one. To hear the familiar strains of the &quot;Ashokan Farewell&quot;, to listen to the wise words of Shelby Foote and Barbara Fields, to see the old, worn photographs forever burned into our collective conscious, brings back all the old feelings I had upon first viewing. But it's also new. The &quot;cleaned up&quot;, restored version of the series looks amazing. The interviews look pristine, as if they were just filmed yesterday. The soundtrack stunning, rich and deep. The work they put into this restoration is well worth it.Ken Burns work set the highwater mark for future documentaries. If you take a look at documentaries done since &quot;The Civil War&quot;, many of them copied his photograph, narration format that was so revolutionary at the time. Rightfully so, this series will be the benchmark for all future documentaries to come!So sit back, and enjoy Ken Burns' gift to America, a recounting of the Civil War, a recounting of the second birth of our nation.	5.0	A monumental creation to a monumental war...	2002-10-05	8	6	2

Far too many Americans today have no clue what the war was about nor the causes that created the war nor the ramifications of the war when it ended. The Civil War is THE most important moment in the history of the United States. Even though the war ended over 140 years ago it still effects us today. Everything the U.S. is today as a country is because of what happened between 1861 to 1865 and the years before and after the war was fought. Ken Burns did an outstanding job in presenting the Civil War series. It is by far the best program to ever have appeared on television. The program is not totally perfect. There are little inaccuracies in fact and timelime here and there. But they are minor and far between and may be overlooked because how well put together the whole body of work is. This program is not only riviting to watch it compells you to watch and learn and hopefully understand better the bloodiest period in American history.	5.0	A Must For All To See	2011-11-07	0	0	0

If you are undecided about buying it, just think of it as a cultural investment. I first watched this in High School and have watched it once a year since the 90s.

This topic was perfect for the Ken Burns style of documentary.  He makes you really feel what it was like by his interviews of historians and their descriptions, as well as the way the individuals involved viewed everything.  Shelby Foote was especially interesting to listen to.  David McCullough is a great narrator.

Goodson	"I became interested in the Civil War because I read the book ""The Killer Angels"" by Michael Shaara, and, like Ken Burns, I became fascinated with Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, a figure who apparently was very prominent in the Army of the Potomac, but never written about in any of the history books I had studied while in school.  His story made the war real to me, and Ken Burns' documentary brought all of those historical figures to life - as well as the plight of those who suffered during the war.  I loved the use of real historical photos, and the music in the background set the mood.  I recommend this documentary to all Americans, as both North and South are wellrepresented in their views.

I enjoyed being able to put together more of the background of the Civil War time period after watching Lincoln (starring Daniel Day Lewis).I am not what you would call a history buff, but I understood the main themes presented here. There are some points that I plan to research to satisfy my own curiousity in the days/weeks to come. I would recommend you watch this film whether you are just starting your learning about the Civil War or if you want a nice concise overview of the years 1861-1865 in American History.	4.0	Want an overview to the American Civil War with points of interest to follow up on?	2013-07-09	0	0	0

As a home-school parent, I've discovered how truly interesting and necessary studying history is.  We paired Ken Burns' Civil War series with book 6 of Joy Hakim's History of US and a few other reference tools for a 9 week study on the Civil War.  Short of being there, I don't know how it could have been brought any more ""home"" to us. For his part, so intricately and delicately did Burns weave the narrated diary entries, documents and letters with the photographic images and interviews with historians, it seemed as if I was watching real-time action.  I will watch this again, but not for awhile.  It's heartbreaking."	5.0	Superb as part of High School history course!	2009-03-18	1	1	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A6KNR46BDWOJU	JJ	I probably cannot cover much that hasn't been covered under past reviews but my take on this documentary is just awe inspiring! The thing that strikes me is the commentary by Writer Shelby Foote, absolutely amazing to have such a respected historians own words!  You can just feel for these soldiers and family during this time like it happened yesterday, just so sad to see all the lives lost in this conflict..What was done on this documentary that is different from others is Ken Burns way of taking an absolutely bloody conflict and adding the human side to it, the side that includes real accounts from diary entries and family letters to put a face where one might not have been..You might get the diary entry and an actual picture of the soldier which is so nice to see because sometimes with the old black and white pictures they can speed through it with so many facts that it leaves behind the human feeling that though this was the late 1800's those people did exist and these things did happen..In the end the documentary covered the war so much while putting such emotion into it that you really feel a sadness yet with the words from the past Ken Burns paints a picture for us to see the civil war as truly what it was brother against brother, father against son...A war that you actually had to stand up for what you believe in enough to choose sides and fight against your own but it shows you how really this war had to be fought and why...This is a documentary that needs no re-enactments to hold it's own as the best civil war documentary ever produced..A civil war documentary that needs only words and black and white photographs to tell it's story.. As first stated, throughout the documentary writer Shelby Foote is giving bits of commentary over the whole thing which is another thing that makes this documentary special, to hear such a civil war historian like foote explaining the little known facts about the war made it that much more enjoyable...You find out things about the generals that you might not have known, I've loved learning about the civil war since childhood and I found there were things I never heard before on here maybe it's the neutral balance between north and south...Many documentaries on the civil war carry a northern or a southern bias, never can you find an enjoyable documentary that takes you on such a fascinating ride through history to the time of lincoln and one of our nations great struggles..I wish I had this as a kid, I would have soaked this up so if you have kids interested in the civil war, especially old photos then this is your documentary..Or for the enthusiasts like me that want to add a gem of knowledge to your collection, that adds that spark to you civil war section...To be truthful this to me is the only civil war documentary made today that is worth mentioning!For those of us that are fanatical about the civil war and it's history to the amateur who is just starting to learn, this is truly the most beautiful civil war collection to have..Words cannot describe what this work does to me, I can only state what I know and Hope that you may treasure this as I do	5.0	Brilliant!!!

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1R3YG7BCYT2XL	J. Klein	I'm currently watching this online for the first time since it originally aired.The series works well when it brings the viewer the experience of the participants to life in their own words and in photographs.It does however, leave out some bigger-picture items. For instance, no mention of why the Confederacy fired on Fort Sumter in the first place. a pretty big omission IMO, and would not have cost them much time to cover. Also, the Fort Pillow incident is presented strictly from the Northern viewpoint, using newspaper clippings/headlines. I've read enough of this action as to cast some doubt as to what actually happened.Burns also seems reluctant to say anything bad about Lincoln, who had said some fairly negative things regarding Blacks. No mention of alternatives to war either.Good series, but not w/o fault.	4.0	Pretty good series, but...	2011-03-04	4	3	1

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A343CRJ1JDE6RP	"J. M. Jacobs ""Just one man's opinion..."""	"I wonder if I can say anything that hasn't already been said about this marvelous piece of work? How much do we owe to a documentary about a critical time in American history that's actually enjoyable to watch... and hear?To see even one installment of this series is to get hooked... Period. I remember when it first aired and I watched the first segment. I made the mental note to myself... ""Do NOT miss any of the rest of these!""And thus was I baptized into my love of this glorious piece of work.Upon a considered third viewing, this time being of my own copy, I was struck by the fact that Burns took great pains to get out just exactly why each side felt it was in the right. That was a pretty evenhanded approach in my book and it allows more of the truth of the matter to come out.A side note on the song selected as the theme, ""Ashokan Farewell."" It strikes a beautiful note of sadness and longing which you can relate to being homesick, the loss of a loved one, being separated from one you love. There is a Special Feature dedicated to the writing and use of this song and it made me like it a lot more than I did in the first place. When you hear it, you'll know what I mean.If you're thinking about purchasing this item but the price seems a little daunting, let me reassure you that it is worth whatever is being asked for it. Maybe you could go to your library and check it out a little first. I think if you watch just the first installment, you'll find yourself wanting to expose yourself to more of Mr. Burns' technique as far as a study of the Civil War is concerned and do so deeply enough that you will want to own this DVD set.In school, we didn't spend enough time on the subject of the Civil War to truly understand most of it. The scope is simply too large to be dealt with adequately in a limited timeframe. Here no such error in length occurs. You're steeped in the atmosphere of our nation almost 150 years ago, and because of Burns' careful guidance, you'll come to see an important part of how we, as a nation, came to be where we are today.In my view, it is impossible to recommend this one strongly enough."	5.0	Almost too good to say anything worthwhile about it	2009-04-10	1	1	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AYKYFFCC49HVT	J. Mullin	If you are like me, you tried taping these wonderful episodes when they were aired on PBS years ago and kept botching up the job (I kept forgetting to turn on the tapes on time after the pledge drive interruptions). So, despite enjoying the episodes, you have done without the complete set for years. Well, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a handomsely packaged, complete copy of this classic documentary about perhaps the seminal event in our nation's history.Most of you who are reading this have seen at least a portion of this film and are familiar with Burns' documentary style. He uses top actors to record written or spoken words of his participants (for example, Sam Waterston does a great job with Lincoln), and he interposes those voices over photographs of the speaker, battlefield maps and photographs (modern and classic), while playing period music or battle sounds in the background. The music is perfect for the occasion, and lingers in your head for days after watching any of the tapes. There are no reenactments like in other documentaries of war, but oddly the battles and participants seem to come to life more authentically using Burns' technique. Then, periodically, he inserts video commentary by leading historians to provide some background information, or to put the action in context. Shelby Foote is primarily used, and his sage commentary led me to read his masterpiece three part Narrative History of the Civil War, but others are interviewed as well including Stephen Oates, biographer of Lincoln (With Malice Toward None), etc.All in all, the series is a stunning achievement, which captivated the attention of the public toward the war between the states while revolutionizing the method of making documentaries of pre-film historical events. There are occasional misses, like the repeated close-up interviewing of a 100+ year old African American woman in the Gettysburg tape whose commentary is hardly legible. However, I respectfully disagree with those reviewers who chide Burns for not spending enough time on the events and political struggles leading up to the conflict - these are powerful and important issues to be sure, but they are outside the scope, budget, and timeframe of this project.  Some of the same reviewers have said Burns also ignored some of the &quot;less important&quot; conflicts, like the war in the west. Well, what (other than the 100 yr old woman interviews) would you cut out?  Or should the film be 20 hours long instead of 11? It's like making a film on reconstruction, and suggesting that it didn't have enough material on the end of the war. This is an 11 hour film on the war, and I think it succeeds on every level.  It's worth twice the price.	5.0	Stunning - as entertaining as it is informative	2001-01-30	13	13	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AQ8XPRFYN67VU	Joanna	This 8- or 9-part series provides an overview with some details. I like that it gave insight into the personalities of the military and political leaders during 1861-1865, and shared a generally unbiased view of the American Civil War. I would have liked more context around the beginning of the War as well as more information on how it coloured the American public, politics, economy, etc.; there was some sprinkled throughout but not as much as I was hoping.Because there wasn't a capability to film back in the 1860s, the majority of the video is still shots, which can be dry at times. However, there are interviews interspersed, and multiple narrators keep the audio fresh and interesting. The couple of video interviews with people who had been alive at the time are especially fascinating, now that we're 150 years after the conflict.	4.0	Covers full timeline of battles	2013-05-22	0	0	0

This show really opened my eyes up about Northern ideals and some of the poor leadership they had until they got to U.S. Grant.Grant's treatment of Gen. Lee at Appomattox Courthouse made a big impression on me on just how honorable these men were back then.

Produced by Ken Burns this series tells the story of the Civil War from 1861-1865.  Mr. Burns and his crew did an outstanding job of presenting this great war in a interesting and moving way.  It is not an easy understaking in going thru literally millions of photos, maps, biographys, diarys, battle books, and other published and unpublished forms and edit them to create a solid, interesting, and accurate retelling of the war especially 130 years after the ending of the war when it was aired in 1990.  Great historians such as Shelby Foote, Ed Bearss, James Iverson and others give interesting comments and analysis throught the series.  Haunting and wonderful music enhances the documentary, and of course the great narration by noted historian David McCullough made this the most watch documentary series in PBS history.It would take to long to go thru each segment of this documentary and explain each one.  Let me say though, that each segment beginning with the years before the Civil War and to then end of the war give great history and the photos related outstandingly with the narration.  This series is rebroadcasted on occasion and it is just as good to watch now as when it was first aired.  This series truly brought America's interest back to the tragic era of the Civil War.

There are several aspects of the documentary which are compelling, from the narration of David McCullough, to the choosing of various actors and others to give voice to many of the important, and not so important people of that era alone make this documentary great.A few things stand out. Obviously there was no motion pictures from that era, but Burn's style of zooming in and slowly moving over the still photos that were taken during the war, makes those photos come to life as no other technique can.Burns was also excellent in his choice of historians to give the background of the war, and how the war progressed, as well as the other issues, such as abolitionism, which played an important part.What really made this stand out, however, was the choice to record from the diaries and letters of actual soldiers and other witnesses to this defining moment in US history. Many documentaries only focus on the military strategy and actions of the generals and political leaders. With Burns, you get an idea of how ordinary people experienced the war.And then there is the music. The selection of both period songs, to the theme, which is actually a modern song, perfectly matches the mood.This documentary was the highest rated program EVER for PBS, when it was released 20 years ago."	5.0	Best documentary ever	2012-03-29	4	3	1

Beatty	There's nothing new, nothing original, and certainly nothing very informative if you've read more than two general histories.  There's no technical novelties, no dramatic moments, no real excitement.The only point to this film was to make money for Ken Burns, and that it did.  Save your money and effort if you can already put the Civil War in the corrct third of a century.	1.0	Nothng to recommend it	2002-08-08	123	9	114

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2TDO5NYPCVXYA	John M. Lounsbury	I really like to study the Civil War and have read a lot about it.  This particular set of videos by Ken Burns is simply outstanding. I had seen some of them on TV, but I decided to buy the package when it went on sale. Ken Burns is well recognized as outstanding in writing books and producing DVDs about subjects like The Civil War  I always had a sense of wanting to know all about it.  The DVD set was my way of getting interesting information and real videos about The War. I already have several Civil War and books. However, these DVDs are really good, and they use quite a few quotes from people of that period in the 19th Century who observed or went through the War. II haven't seen any other video series that is as good as this one.The only downside, if there is one, is that the series can seem long and dragged out. There is good vocalization about the pictures of the war and people who went through it.  The music played in the background is slow and solem, and it can be a little depressing if you sit and watch too much of the series at a time.  The pace of the DVD's seems somewhat slow. I found that to be a positive rather than putting too much information out at the same time. I would buy this DVD set again and may get another copy for my son who is a Civil War buff.  PBS has run the The Civil War a number of times over the years.  That's okay.  They don't present too much at one time. With the DVDs, I can control how much I watch at a time. On TV, if you miss 20 minutes, well, you've missed 20 mintues and can't make it up until the next time the series is run on TV.	5.0	The Civil War by Ken Burns provides a complete history of the War.  The DVDs are easy to listen to and informative.	2012-12-26	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A25CQTB313XDWO	"JON STRICKLAND ""Jon Strickland"""	"Ken Burns' Civil War is one of the greatest documentary films I have ever seen. Though it is sketchy in some places, Ken Burns nonetheless performed a masterpiece summarizing in eleven hours a tumultuous period in America's history that went on for at least five years.Burns depicts and highlights the adversities that soldiers and military leaders of both the Union and the Confederacy had to deal with. It was quite interesting to listen to the historians and writers, including Shelby Foote, account how rough the going was for the Union at the start of the Civil War, for the Confederacy had top-notch generals in Robert E. Lee and ""Stonewall"" Jackson who, despite their limited numbers of forces, were equipped with rebel soldiers who, thanks to their hunting and gathering upbringing, were skilled marksmen long before they entered the battlefield; the Union, on the other hand, had, in large part, troops whose backgrounds did not adequately equip them for effective use of weaponry.On a broad scale, recurring themes concerning both sides which include: communication (or lack thereof), coordination, cooperation, strategic revision, and retraining are prevalent throughout. Near the end of the Civil War, however, it seemed to be all about: persistence, will, and reinforcement, all of which were becoming more present in the Union's court.Other noteworthy topics are the number of lives lost in each key battle as well as the toll the casualties had taken on each state's budget. Alarming was the percentage of Mississippi's revenues that ended up being used exclusively for artificial limbs.Despite the focus on the hardships, many of which were accounted for in the vast number of studied notes and letters written to families at the time, Ken Burns' Civil War, nonetheless, does have a lighter side to the subject. Included in this DVD collection are humorous anecdotes recorded by Grant, Lee, Jackson, etc. One such laughable moment was Grant's recollection of how he was not able to familiarize himself with many of the marching tunes that accompanied his forces and how he ended up handling this predicament.All in all, I salute the quality of this work. Ken Burns' Civil War is, by and large, a thorough summary of how hard living was for people back then so that those of us living today could have it so much easier by comparison. It is a powerful reminder that we should be ashamed for taking for granted so many blessings bestowed upon us in this modern world, for these good things in life would very likely not have existed without the persistence of our forefathers to pave roads to excellence that we today can travel and build upon."	5.0	Stark Details of Some of America's Darkest Hours	2003-03-07	14	14	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3MME9TD0UXGY4	Joseph O Batyko	The Civil War produced by Ken Burns is a learning experience relevant to all Americans and without doubt the finest documentary film ever made. What especially interested me were the ironc twists and turns of fate that in some cases produced greatness. How, for example, does a plodding man who was unsuccessful at every venture he tried suddenly become a brilliant military stratigest able to motivate his troops to defeat the great Robert E. Lee. Until Lincoln discoverd U.S. Grant every commander Lincoln used lacked the stomach to pursue the undermaned but more than capably led Confederates. How were we as a young nation so lucky to have a man as great as Lincoln become President. He was determined and unwavering in his commitment to stop secession and just as determined to emancipate the slaves. Lincoln was our greatest President not only because of his compassion but his intelligence.As Burns shows us virtually every move he made from promoting Grant to the Emancipation Proclamation was masterful.Holding a open hand out to the South in Lincoln's words &quot;with malice toward none and charity for all&quot; was exactly what both sides needed to hear.Nathan Bedford Forrest son of an illiterate farmer became a  millionaire farming  cotton and trading slaves. When fighting broke out he rounded up a group of rebel horsemen outfitted and paid them out of his own pocket and, despite not having any formal military education, was so feared and so sucessful a Cavalry General that none other than William Tecumseh Sherman called him the finest General on either side.	5.0	Ken Burns The Civil War	2002-09-28	5	3	2

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1RBE8GZPV7YIB	Joyanne M. Bell	This series was interesting the first time I saw it on television, years ago, and I always wondered if I would be able to view all of the episodes, in order.  Among the works of Ken Burns, The Civil War strikes me as quite balanced in its viewpoint.  It takes mainly a Union-sided view, but it looks rather deeply into hearts in the Confederacy as well.  It acknowledges that the Civil War was heavily based on the issue of slavery, but also as it stood within broader questions, such as the unity of a nation, the rights of Americans and the states, in the presence of federal decrees, to decide their own way of life, and the right to keep property.  This film strongly emphasizes the humanity and higher potential of those who suffered under slavery, and it reveals many individual attitudes of the time.The production stays interesting to watch because of good camera work with still photographs, modern scenes of old battlefields and other places, constant attention to message and tone, interviews with subject experts, narrative discussion, quotes from letters and history, good use of voices, and other techniques that combine to build an informative and moving story.	5.0	Famous for a reason	2011-05-05	1	1	0

It is a MUST for every civil war buff. It is the best way to learn about the war, and as a young teenager it helped spur my interest in the war. I am 26 now, and couldn't wait to purchase it. I love all Ken Burns documentaries, but this is my favorite.My favorite part of the whole documentary is the letters from people such as Mary Chestnut, who actually lived through the war.I am glad that the installment has finally come out on DVD. My mom had the VHS set, and mine takes up a lot less space on my shelf. It's also easier to access if you want to re-watch a certain battle you have interest in. Typically, after I visit Gettysburg ( as I do annually), I like to watch the time leading up to the battle on the DVD before my trip, and then the actual tape on the battle afterwards. It just intensifies the meaning of the whole experience.	5.0	Amazing	2004-12-01	8	7	1

It is like a good museum, you see and learn something different each time you watch it. The death and destruction is still stunning and tragic. Burns film illustrates once again that this war was about slavery, and that we are still fighting it. Hopefully, a larger historical perspective will give this war meaning in humankind's evolution. 150+ years on, it still seems like a misguided and preventable bloodbath. Although the nation became one in a literal sense, civil rights didn't appear for another 100 years, and states are still talking about succession. It makes one wonder, did it really accomplish anything? Did 650,000 people really need to die? As a patriotic citizen of this great country, the Civil War still haunts me everyday.	5.0	Better the 5th time around	2011-04-10	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A11JMBVJ07W5DB	Juridicus	"There are books and music we call classics because they can be read and re-read or played over and over again without tiring of their meanings and beauty.  Ken Burs's Civil War is one.  We all know the outcome of the war as a simple fact.  Burns makes us live it.  After watching this documentary many times, I began to pay less attention to war strategy and was drawn into the life of the times.  I can almost feel the texture of those hot wool unifoms, the cold of fighting in the winter without adequate shoes and clothes, the smells of horses, unwashed men, the sweet smells of unpolluted forests, mud - and blood.  I was with Sherman when he held his nightly discussions with his officers far from the battlefield to escape the cries of the wounded.  And I felt the serenity when Stonewall Jackson, in his final delerium, and, with his last words, ordered his troops to ""cross over the river and rest in the shade of the trees"".  In short, Burns made me fell that I was there among the masses of human carnage listening for their thoughts as they died.  The letter from Sullivan Ballou to his wife is a haunting reminder that each of the 600,000 dead were individual people and not just statistics.Picket's charge seems idotic to us today, but that was the strategy of the times.  We can see for ourselves that the massive number of dead resulted from the triumph of technology over tactics.  The Civil War was the beginning of mechanized combat, the genesis of the ""machine gun"", mass killing with canon loaded with grape shot and mortars loaded with lethal pieces of jagged steel.  The series chronicles the end of the sailinng ship as a war machine and the beginnings of marine armor that changed the world's navies.One can watch this series many times and each time discover something that was missed in all the past viewings and become lured even farther into reliving those significant times.  That is my meaning of a classic."	5.0	This Is a Classic	2009-03-04	2	1	1

No stone is left  unturned in his thorough research and clear delivery. He uses historians to deliver the story of the Civil War in a clear and concise and entertaining manner. His choice of narrators and voices is outstanding and poignantly sensitive to the events of the time.

The moving love letter from a soldier to his wife before he goes into battle still brings tears to my eyes.  Being from the South, I appreciate the way Burns treats their cause with dignity and understanding.  There is no gloating over a defeated half of a nation who believed in secession from the union.  This is a difficult subject, but Burns handled it about as well as it can be done.  Whether you are from the North or South, you will learn something about how this tragedy happened and what it cost our ancestors.  There is no glamor in war.  It is brutal and ugly.  Every generation must learn it's lessons and recover from grievous losses.  May we never repeat the same mistake twice!	5.0	The Civil War	2013-06-20	0	0	0

Back in 1990, I taped it of PBS and didn't hesitate to purchase it on DVD as soon as it was available.This ""new"" (2004) DVD package seems to be physically different than the ""old"" (2002) DVD package that I bought.  Mine has (had) a gold banner on the top where it says ""PBS Home Video"", while this one is silver.  I'm thinking that they changed this because the gold flakes off very easy.  Other than that, I'm happy with my ""old"" DVD package.With one small exception, that is.The ""wobble"" that many reviews talk about.  Recently, I looked back on my old VHS tapes and the ""wobble"" didn't appear to be as pronounced as it does on the DVD package.  It is only a minor annoyance, but it would've been nice if they had done something about it.Something else that I was thinking:  In the ""Re-Making of the Civil War"" documentary in the ""Special Features"" section, they say that they ran the old film through a datacine and captured the film at ""5 to 6 times"" that of 480 (original telecine).  They went on to say that it was datacined down to ""film granual level"" and showed a demonstration.  Each frame, taken from original film, would be between 2,000 and 2,400 lines!  Each frame was also, as they said, 14MB!  Did they digitize the entire series at once or did they just do a little bit at a time?  If they did it all at once, that is an insane amount of data.  14MB * 24 (frames per second) * 60 (minute) * 60 (hour) * (Entire hour length).  You get the idea.This is what I am getting at:  If they still have all this datacined data, then shouldn't it be pretty trivial to re-release the series on Blu-Ray?  Would 1080p be worth it since it is just still pictures?  Can they fix the ""wobble"" problem in the process?  Finally, figure out a way to get it neatly in 16:9.  I'll re-buy the set for $200 for all the above."	4.0	Do they still have the digital master?	2008-03-12	13	10	3

Through photographs, modern footage of the places in question, period music, and voices reading primary source documents of the time, Burns conjures up the conflict in all its thrilling drama, bloody tragedy, dark humor, and stirring nobility. Personal and engaging, this film brought a new awareness of American history to millions of viewers. It should be noted that a huge topic such as the Civil War cannot be entirely crammed into one film, however long; this is necessarily an overview, though an excellent and detailed one. (At least the Civil War had a compact number of years to it; Burns subsequently took on huger topics still such as Baseball and Jazz, with less success. His finite films like this one and ""Lewis and Clark"" are easier to see as a whole.) I have one quibble with this show - I think it oversimplifies the causes of the war. To be specific, it sees only one cause - slavery - and pays no attention to states' rights or economic issues. This is no surprise; his other films have shown us that Burns sees race as the defining issue of our country. Whether you entirely agree with this idea or not, you are sure to enjoy and learn from this epic documentary."	5.0	Fine Film	2002-09-23	10	6	4

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A362QP1G931H2A	Kenneth L. Habegger	This series is a enlightening summary of the atmosphere that lead to the civil war and the brutality of the battles.  Both sides expected the conflict to last only about 90 days, but decisions and events prolonged the war for four years.  I had not realized that Robert E. Lee was offered command of the Union forces by President Lincoln, but declined and remained loyal to his home state of Virginia.  Abraham Lincoln initially was not against slavery, but his goal as to same the union.  Later the Emancipation Proclamation raised the mission of the war from one of saving the union to one of saving the state of mind for mankind which gave the cause honor.  I was awed by the fact that on many occasions the war could likely have been won by the North and been shortened to a year or two, but for the decisions made by the Union generals, particularly George McClellan.  However, the South was the winner in many of the early battles and had opportunities to become the ultimate victor as well.  England and France were being affected by the war due to the loss of cotton trade with the South and attempted to procure an armistice between the parties to restore trade.  I still have a few episodes to watch.	5.0	Extraordimary events revealed that I had not known	2014-01-22	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1ZGAZLH9K711I	Keonyn	One of the most memorable and well done documentaries of our day. Ken Burns mastery of storytelling using little more than authentic still photography and camera panning and voice overs has given us an 11 hour documentary on the definitive war of our country that has remained unsurpassed for nearly 20 years.The film uses a great deal of authentic photography from the war and excerpts from journals and letters written during the war read by a cast of amazing voice actors who sound so authentic in the language of the day and emotion that you'll swear you were hearing the voices of the real people from beyond the grave. David McCullough lends his voice to the narration of the documentary and does it as well or better than any other narrator I've heard in either film or documentary.The series covers nearly every relevant part of the war from the years leading up to it to the years following it. By using journals and letters written by people from that era it gives you a great insight in to how people saw the war and how it impacted their lives. The series isn't completely analytical so you won't find a step by step analysis of every battle fought, frankly, that would get a little dull anyhow. It does cover the key events of the war and then some though it does leave out a few, most notably the secession of West Virginia from the confederacy which doesn't even get a mention.It's few faults hardly drag it down though as it did so much so well. This series provides an unsurpassed insight in to this great war and really examines the human element to it while still providing a decent tactical analysis as well. It's an amazing piece that manages to provide 11+ hours of interesting footage despite relying on still photos, interviews and voice actors reading material from the period. This is a must have for any Civil War buff or fan of documentaries.	5.0	A masterpiece of simplicity	2008-02-15	2	2	0

True, not all material could be included...unless filmakers wanted to exceed the 11 hours that this documentary already comprises.  This is a stirring masterwork which features master historians with the powers of captivating story -- Shelby Foote, Ed Bearss, and others.  Giving renewed life and voice to those who have passed on, the drama of this timescape is carefully unfolded.  It is filled with struggle, humanity, and grace.  If I could afford the collector's box set, I'd own it...but it's a tad expensive.  If you can afford it, buy it -- it will be a set that you often revisit.

Even though they did not cover ALL the battles as completely as I think they should have. I mean it IS a documentary. And this was an important part of American history.  There was no mention about the battles west of the Mississippi. Or if there was, they were quickly dismissed. The issues of European involvement were ignored. The importance of blockade-running was not given much time. The almost one-sided technological advancements made during this war barely mentioned. The anti-war movements in North and the South forgotten. But the music....so moving. The letters and still photos used to give you a sense of the battles and the feelings and thoughts of the soldiers and civilians caught up in such a terrible time makes this worth watching.

Mr. Burns' contributions to helping the public understand the Civil War cannot be measured. He has taken this war and broken it down in the simplest forms. He has put faces on the faceless. He has told the stories of the nameless fighting men. He has helped us understand the famous figues of the War (such as Grant, Lee, Jackson, Sherman, Lincoln and Douglass).However, Burns is one-sided in telling the whole story. He is more interested in the events that happened in the East (example Gettysburg). However, events that happened in the West is just as important. I wanted to learn more about Grant's success in the West and the fall of Vicksburg. I wanted to learn about the Generals of the West, such as Thomas, Johnston, Hardee, Howard and even the folliest of generals Braxton Braggs and John Bell Hood.This documentary is a great start, but I suggest looking into other Civil War films that tells the complete story from BOTH fronts.	5.0	Excellent Documentary....	2008-03-09	3	2	1

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1X544VTNGWISS	Larry Neal Poole	To say that this masterful creator of fine documentary films has set the standard for all future film efforts on this subject is, by now, 12 years after it first appeared, redundant.  He has given us a film which should be required viewing by every american.  As historian Steven Ambrose has so often admonished us, freedom is not free.  It has been purchased with the blood of countless thousands.  To forget this or, what is worse, to be unmoved by it, is beneath contempt.  As Shelby Foote said in the film, you cannot hope to understand why we, as americans, are who we are without understanding this terrible conflict.Mr. Burns has shown us the military, social, and above all, the personal consequences of the war on those who fought it and on those they left behind.  I'm sure that this film has motivated many to explore the war in depth through books, family archives and other sources of information.  Hopefully, when PBS airs it again beginning September 22, 2002, many more will want to explore the war further; perhaps to learn what part their families may have played in the history of their country.  Who would not want to do this?  It is fascinating and rewarding; and, in my opinion, should be considered the duty of every citizen who loves his country.	5.0	The Architype for Civil War Documentaries	2002-08-28	5	5	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	Once a year I rewatch Ken Burn's celebrated documentary on &quot;The Civil War,&quot; listening to David McCullough's narration haunting narration as hundreds of still photographs from the period are  brought alive by combining them with contemporary interviews with historians like Shelby Foote, mutli-layered sound effects, the voices of actors such as Morgan Freeman and Sam Waterson, and the simple but evocative music.  We become hooked on this compelling narrative at the end of the first episode, with its unforgettable section on &quot;Honorable Manhood,&quot; which includes the letter written by Major Sullivan Ballou of the 2nd Rhode Island to his wife Sarah back home in Smithfield, a week before the first battle of Manassas. The letter is as emotionally powerful as it is poetic, and once you hear it you will not be surprised that it was included on the CD.  I was also struck by the revelation at the end of the documentary of how the glass plates of photographs taken during the war were sold to greenhouses, where the sun slowly burned away the grim images of death.  In between Burns covers the Civil War in detail, focusing not only on Presidents Lincoln and Davis as well as all the Generals from Grant and Lee to Butler and Forrest, but common soldiers like Elisha Hunt Rhodes and Sam Watkins.  By personal favorite discovery form this film is Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain.  There is just so much to take away from this documentary.  Even if you are not a Civil War buff, watching &quot;The Civil War&quot; is a remarkable experience.	5.0	A landmark documentary that bring the Civil War home	2001-06-03	22	20	2

I have been interested in Civil War history since childhood but Ken Burn's definitive and history making opus forever changed how I viewed this conflict...almost overnight any and all of the romanticism I had tended to associate with war in general and with the Civil War in particular were GONE WITH THE WIND-pun intended. In it's place were real life men-and boys- and women. Real flesh and blood. Real suffering. Real heroism. Real terror, hate, ugliness and death. I found myself cringing and dreading the next episodes at times but I could never, ever have simply turned away and stopped watching.Like so many other reviewers have stated, this series affected me on every level...emotional, physical and even spiritually. No review I write could ever do justice to it's haunting brilliance.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	When this stunning 11 hour documentary was released on PBS in 1990, I remember watching parts of it with awe.  But that was years ago, years before I could easily record episodes on DVR and, frankly, years before my interest in history grew passionate.  That's why I was so delighted with the 5-disc set released in 2004. However, I did find the package a little awkward and it's easy to make a mistake and wind up viewing the same episode twice or missing one altogether, but once these small details are mastered, what is left is the feeling that I have actually lived during those tumultuous times and I now understand how this war has shaped the history of my beloved country, the United States of America.Ken Burns's use of archival photos, interviews with historians, original and traditional music and voice-overs by well-known actors such as Julie Harris, Morgan Freeman and Jason Roberts make this epic haunting, especially since Mr. Burns clearly has a sense of irony and uses it throughout.  However, it is the facts that make this story real, the facts that chill me to the bone.  More then 618,000 people lost their lives in the Civil War.  In the Battle of Gettysburg alone there were 54,112 casualties, including the wounded who often had to have their limbs amputated because guns shot bullets in a spray which literally destroyed bones.The film is divided into nine episodes.  The first describes the history of the causes of the war.  I could feel the tension mounting during this episode because we all knew what was to come.  It was especially sad to see the enthusiasm of the confederates which was so very misplaced.  The second episode brings out how the war to preserve the union became a war to free the slaves.  It also describes the new weapons, such as ironclad ships.  I had heard of ironclad ships before, but now they became real to me, especially with the introduction of diaries of some of the men who actually manned them.  In the third episode the Union forces are suffering defeat but Lincoln still decides to go ahead with the Emancipation Proclamation.  Throughout the series we are constantly learning about the generals on both sides and in the fourth episode we see the combat between Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant.  Throughout, we also feel their humanity.  The interviews with historians, specifically Shelby Foote, really bring this out.  The turning point of the War, the battle of Gettysburg, and the draft riots in New York are depicted in the fifth episode, as well as beginning of the use of Negro troops by the Union forces. There are more battles in the sixth episode, and a description of Lincoln's bid for reelection.  By the seventh episode we see people turning against the war as battles continue to rage.  General Sherman's march to the sea is the highlight of the eighth episode.  Victory seems assured for the Union but the Confederates continue to fight on as the South is being destroyed.  Then, in the ninth episode the war is finally over, but not without a lot of sorrow.  Lincoln has lived to see the end of the war but then his life is ended by assassination.Life goes on.  Years pass.  The soldiers who lived through the War turn into old men, march in parades.  Eventually, we see them no more, and the memory of the war lives on only in history books.  I'm inspired to read more, even explored reading Shelby Foote's 3-volume saga.  But when I looked for it in a bookstore I discovered that each book is 900 dense pages long and I could barely lift each book.  So I guess I'll leave this history for the historians.  That's why I'm so delighted that Ken Burns made this series.  If you want to learn about this definitive period of history, this classic Ken Burns work is the way to go.  I give it my highest recommendation.	5.0	As this haunting epic unfolded, I felt I was living through the Civil War.	2008-02-21	0	0	0

One can feel - and see -- the wretched tension in his grave face as he charts the course toward unifying this divisive struggle into a new integrated Nation.150 years out, I definitely recommend revisiting this saga for insights and lessons for our country -- and citizens today.

I am almost amazed that we had waited so very long to buy it. The job that Ken and Richard Burns did was nothing short of incredible. The jacket notes let us know how they went about their daunting task. They were no less excellent in their choice of commentators. We eagerly awaited each time we were about to hear from Shelby Foote, for example. The other commentators were as good, but Mr. Foote seemed to embody, by some magical means, the tales he told.In this year, when the Civil War is everywhere, when the films like ""Gettysburg"" and ""Glory"" are being resurrected, to have a tool as grand in scope and as deep in treatment as this one is truly uncanny.But this is more than a tool. It is a trip back in time. It tells little-known stories, by little-known story-tellers, to immerse us so completely that ""we were there"", Thanks Amazon!"	5.0	150 YEARS LATER !	2011-07-06	1	1	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2011JHYNSQIPO	"Luke B. ""youngstudent"""	This film is produced by northerners and is very biased.  Throughout the documentary, Ken Burns portrays Lincoln as the great emancipator and humanitarian.  Lincoln told the nation when he was inaugurated he had no intention of freeing the slaves and he felt he had no right to do so.  The emancipation freed no slaves at the time.  It was a shrewd political move.  He had power to free the slaves in the north and in the territories during the war but he didn't.  He wouldn't where he could and he couldn't where he would.  It also misrepresents the North and South's motives for fighting.  97% of Southern families owned no slaves.  This film portrays the South as being full of cruel slave owners!  U.S. General Grant owned slaves!!  Ken Burns also forgot to mention that between 30,000 and 50,000 blacks, free and slave, voluntarily fought or aided the Confederacy.  The South was fighting for the same thing their forefathers fought for in the American Revolution (independence from the rule of a tyrannical government).  The Southern soldier was fighting to save state soverignty and constitutional liberty which northern radicals were trampling on.  The South's agricultural exports were being taxed so heavily, many planters were being bankrupt.  When the Southern states seceded, the north lost its biggest source of revenue.  So what did they do?  They forced the South back into the Union at gunpoint!!  The north then began the sympathetic act of reconstruction.  TEN YEARS OF MURDER, RAPE, PLUNDER, DESTRUCTION, AND NORTHERN DICTATORSHIP!!  Do they explore these subjects in Ken Burn's Civil War?  No.  This documentary, if viewed, has to be viewed with caution.  Research about reconstruction, black confederates, and the South's true reasons for fighting.  The truth is out there...it just has to be found.	1.0	well researched but very biased and misleading	2003-11-15	86	19	67

Haven taken recommendations from people I decided on this item.The DVD is beautifully shot and is very thorough. It's narrative style is a mixture of commentary, interviews of 'experts' and quotations from soldiers whom fought in the war.  A particular visual feature is the battle scenes are filmed at the time of year they happened. One part I didn't enjoy was the commentary from an author, whose credentials are never established and who seems to harbour a disappointment that The South didn't win.The DVD is informative and it has a nice balance between fact and emotion.Highly recommended.	4.0	Non US citizen review	2011-03-09	2	1	1

I think that he captures the flavor of the people of the time through their writings and the photographs available of the people and the landscapes. The vast array of voice characters is truely amazing as well as the contemporary historians that were interviewed for this film is truely first rate. I especially enjoyed the interviews with Shelby Foote on of the foremost authorities of the Civil War with a keen Southern perspective as well as the North. I've watched this 8 part series twice and in ten or twenty years from now I'll sit and watch it again and I know that I will be just as impressed as I was the first time I saw it.	5.0	The best Documentary I've ever seen.	2013-07-29	0	0	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3AFEF1BJIGN64	malevolentmuse	"Having watched Ken Burns' staggering ""The Civil War"" on PBS for the umpteenth time this past week has made me begin to look at this brilliantly realized documentary differently.  Yes, it is a documentary and yes, it is a TV miniseries, but to lump this 11-hour look at America's darkest years does not do this masterpiece justice.  Burns' masterful ability to enrapt his audience is a testament to his storytelling abilities, abilities that most of today's so-called filmmakers should long to achieve.Using a documentary style so closely linked to him that it is now called ""The Ken Burns' Style,"" Burns took what little physical pieces he had to work with (letters and photos) and used them to his advantage to create an intimacy no other documentary had ever managed to achieve.  By doing so, Burns took non-fiction storytelling to new heights in a way that while commonplace today was revolutionary back in 1990.  Relying on emotional narration (especially the brilliant David McCullough, the film's main narrator) and stirring period music, the audience is not given a history lesson, but rather told a story; a touching, emotional story of a nation divided, a beleaguered President and battles pitting brother against brother and friend against friend.While yes, it is the greatest documentary ever made and it is without a doubt the greatest program ever aired on television, to label ""The Civil War"" as simply a TV show is to not give this FILM its due, a film that certainly ranks among the greatest of all-time, if not as the greatest ever."	5.0	The Greatest Film Ever?

But Ken Burns' documentary of the Civil War was so realistic and  moving, that I had to tear myself away from the television.  The music and  the photographs really make the Civil War come to life before your very  eyes.  Two words that make this film worth watching:  Shelby Foote.  His  stories and insights make him seem as if he were sitting in the room with  you discussing the Civil War.

This series brings to your home the horrors and triumphs that was a bloody and difficult war. From the inside of the south to the thoughts of President Lincoln, there is no work out there that covers not only the historical but the feel of this war. Ken Burns pulls you in with a star vocal cast which you no longer can identify after the second episode other than the voice of the people they portray.If you have not see this, you must. If you have seen it you must have it for your collection.

Ken Burns' account of the war is encyclopedic, and it seems to me that he doesn't have an ax to grind for any of the combatants.  Rather, he portrays the war as a tragedy for the whole country.  Today, it seems that we are a nation ignorant of our history.

Not only to study and learn from this huge conflict, but - in a sense - to experience it.  The production values, composition, and above all the variety and rhythm of the finely edited final product raise it to the level of poetry in my eyes.

You will LOVE Shelby Foote's commentary on the Civil War... he basically makes this documentary shine.  Ken Burns writing and editing does a great job of telling the story through film, of an event there is no film of and filling a horrid event in history with some comedic breaks and with fun facts that give personality to the conflict that really wasn't that long ago.Excellent film - highly recommended.  5 Stars.	5.0	Best documentary ever?	2014-06-23	0	0	0

Most recently I am struck by the delicate profundity in the last episode where historian Shelby Foote quips that we as Americans like to think of ourselves as superior beings with our generals and our battles and so on and so fourth being superior and the Civil War being the greatest war, etc., when if we were such beings no such war would have ever been necessary, nor would we still be fighting it today as historian Barbara J Fields posits.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1AL45IEVLFUCB	Merlin	This series is THE definitive documentary on the American Civil War - it's the first of it's kind in style and content and powerfully evocative of the spirit of the time.  However, there are some inconsistencies which become apparent to the attentive viewer.  For example, statements made throughout the film representing North and South waiver between certainty of Northern perserverance and widespread dissension regarding Lincoln's leadership - points which are not in agreement and do not make a cohesive statement about the momentum of the Union.  And as 'CenterMan' states in his review,  this documentary has a decidedly 'Eastern' tilt and emphasis, probably because Burns is himself a New Englander. The Western states and territories played an extremely important part in the war both militarily and economically, but this is not touched on. To back up another of 'CenterMan's points, the armies of the West, and ESPECIALLY the Generals of the West, were utterly essential to the evolution of the war and warefare in general by the North, from an Eastern generals' stalemate to a frontiersmens' sweep.  Most all of the generals who were made famous by the Civil War, both North and South,  earned their stripes and first practiced their military trade serving together as field officers in the Mexican-American War twenty years prior, and in fact the North's superior use of artillery throughout the war was largely the result of methods first tried and learned by Yankee gunners and officers at Vera Cruz and Mexico City. Both Sherman and Grant, who made broad sweeping movements using entire army groups and army corps became familiar with these tactics in the wide open expanses of the Mexico and then the Indian territories, and used them to devastating effect against the flash and elan of the Confederates. Also, the political and financial importance of California, Utah, and Oregon, which supplied desperately needed cash and gold to the Union in spite of a large seccessionist element, is completely overlooked by Burns. This seems to point out a kind of misperception among many Easterners, both then and now, that the United States is centered on and revolves around their section of the country.  It is a serious misperception and is a major reason the rift between North and South reached the breadth and depth that it did.  Burns focuses on the traditional military and socially emotional issues of the war, which are shown anew, but he does not cover the cornerstones of demographics (the huge disparity in population growth between North and South, in birthrates and immigration) agriculture, finance, or industry, (in particular steel and the railroads), both before and during the war, which are essential to a broad understanding of the Civil War.  Ultimately this documentary is an excellent introductory showpiece and is thoroughly engrossing, and should hopefully inspire students of the subject to probe deeper into it.  It is an excellent piece of art and is worth seeing and owning.	5.0	Great piece of work; good start for beginning historians.	2007-04-26	2	2	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2B58YQFYTX5E4	M	I recently re-watched my set and logged on to buy 2nd set as gift. Sorry to see it only seems to be available individually. Buy them or keep shopping! it's so worth it. Ken Burns did an amazing job. Even if you're only remotely interested in the Civil War, you WILL be hooked. The pictures, the diary entries, it's a very personal account and also quite surprising to see what a miracle it was the North won. Northern Generals like George McClellan were absolute idiots. The South was much smarter tactically and it's clear the only reason the North won was troop volume. This set gets into everything from the day to day hardships of the soldiers to the personal notations of Lee and Lincoln and Davis to the hell the civilians went through. Very eclectic even-handed account that I HIGHLY recommend.	5.0	must see	2006-08-27	5	5	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3THJZS34MBENI	Michael Burton	The film is an absolute masterpiece. Other reviewers can point out how great an influence it has had on other filmmakers. For myself, the film changed--in some surprising ways--how I see much of the world.There's a Bugs Bunny cartoon with a nonsense song about &quot;peeping through the knothole of Grandpa's wooden leg.&quot; After seeing this film, I knew why Grandpa had a wooden leg.When I was younger, in the 1960s, I couldn't comprehend the bitter animosity that many Southern politicians still felt against the North. But when this film showed me the chimneys of ruined buildings in Georgia, I realized: the angry Southern senators of my day had grown up surrounded by the relics of this ruinous war. How could it fail to affect their view of the world?I've watched it, all the way through, perhaps half a dozen times. Every time, it is profoundly moving.The DVD is a bit of a disappointment, if only because the remastered audio track is sometimes out of sync. The original audio track is also on the DVD, and seems not to be affected. The supplemental material is interesting, but a bit thin.

The Civil War is Mr. Burns' greatest work.  The attention to detail brings the history to life.  Mr. Burns does an excellent job of bringing humanity to the tragic time in America.  With the use of solder's and family letters it is evident what a difficult time it was to be an American.  Originally aired on PBS in September of 1990, nearly fifteen years later the series remains the ultimate narrative about the United States darkest time.The series is finally released on DVD.  While the price is a little high the amazing quality of the series makes the cost very reasonable.  Ken Burns' Civil War is required for any Civil War historian's collection.  The series is also a great way for those wishing to learn more about the Civil War.  I would recommend this to anyone that loves historical documentaries.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AAOL3R55JOMPM	Mick_Under the Influence	The cost of this hefty volume, at about $20 per disc, may worry some purchasers. The film certainly hasn't pleased all of the Amazon reviewers. So a quick word to the weary: if you simply despise the notion that the Civil War was fought because of slavery, or feel that any true discussion of the war begins with validation of the reasons for Southern State secession, don't buy.The film highlights prewar abolitionist activities as the war's chief cause and little else. As the film progresses it occasionally returns to the voice and experience of abolition and slavery. However, Shelby Foote, star narrator and Civil War expert, will attempt to provide some balance when he ennunciates so very well a conversation between a ragged, Rebel private and his Union captors. &quot;Didn't own any slaves... illiterate... couldn't have much interest in the constitution... When asked what he was fighting for, he replied... Cause you're down here...&quot; You'll hear President Lincoln's memorable words after the Battle of Antietam, &quot;If I could save the union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save the union by freeing some and leaving others alone I would do it.&quot; In short, as this documentary unravels it offers opposing views on abolition as well as many aspects of the war in the words of Northerners and Southerners.Certainly, any knowledgable Civil War buff knows that these 5 discs, though extensive and detailed, cannot, and do not cover all aspects of the war. And, what of it. I'll wager that there is no other collection of Civil War videos or combination of films that can touch Burn's architecture, depth, or detail. And this breadth, coupled with the balance of viewpoint previously mentioned is what makes this documentary a quality EDUCATIONAL experience.The entirity of the U.S. Civil War 1861-65 is documented roughly one year per disc, including a short prelude to the war, and an interesting biographical summary of the war's celebrities after the war has ended. It is a factual story of the war, revealed in actual photos and quotations, narrated by popular narrators and actors, interviews with historians and topic experts, and woven with period music and recent film footage. Burns' covers the major battles, politics from the home front and government seats, soldierly life, what they ate and drank, how their wounds were treated.Ahh but Burns' ability to pull the pieces together into a story is to be admired. His ability to pull the viewer closer to the people and events is apparent. His film making artistry is as good as the any Hollywood seduction. Initially, I was not pleased with the choice of voice overs, probably as a result of reading extensively about the subject beforehand, but I eventually found myself coming to enjoy them as old friends when I viewed the videos again.Special feature sections are comprised mostly of interviews, discussing the film making processing, the historical importance of this period, and general kudos for Burns' effort. A few maps are included, but don't think you can use them to take a drive from D.C. to Richmond; they are disappointingly lacking in detail. Instead Burns could have culled Claude Van Damme/Rambo fans with photos of nude women straddling Treddegar cannons. Or perhaps advertised his Jazz Documentary. Shameless, I prefer the cannons and must reduce the rating from a 5 to a 4.	4.0	Very entertaining and educational	2003-12-10	8	7	1

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2CDA8OI3BVKPO	Mindhaunt	Extraodinary care and love were given in the production of this epic documentary. This commemorative edition comes with a booklet that describes aspects of the Civil War that are not included in the original version. It also includes an extra disc that includes commentaries by Shelby Foote that were not included in the series in either edition. I didn't know this when I purchased this CD version, but I was pleasantly surprised and impressed. Heck, I would have bought this version for the Shelby Foote commentaries alone, The Civil War was Shelby's passion, and it shows. Ken Burns can rightly be called a genius of film making. This is one purchase that you will NEVER regret, I promise.If you DO regret it, Just bill me.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1AFXJ8U72MD6L	"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie"""	"This is the quintessential documentary on the American Civil War by Ken Burns. Forty million viewers watched it during its initial broadcast, making it the most-watched program ever to air on PBS. It was awarded more than 40 major television and film honors. The film was remastered on the twelfth anniversary of its release, and a book following the movie has also been released.Ken Burns was inspired to make this documentary because of Mathew Brady's photographs. More than 10 hours in length, the documentary has nine episodes that explore the Civil War through personal stories and photos. During the creation of the movie, Burns made extensive use of more than 16,000 archival photographs, paintings, and newspaper images from the time of the war. This resulted in the coining of the term the ""Ken Burns Effect."" (Wiki).This was my third time watching it so I'll just list some of the remarks which stood out for me this time around (first time doing an actual review):More than 3 million men fought in it and over 600,000 died in it.So many Southerners applied that a third had to be turned away early on. Odds were against them with a Union population of 21 million to their 9 million which included 4 million unarmed slaves. The value of all manufactured goods were  of those produced in the state of New York but the South didn't care.At Fort Sumter in South Carolina General Beaureguard fired on Major Anderson, his old artillery instructor who kept him on for an extra year as an aide. This was truly a war in which family and friends were pitted against one another.At the Battle of Shiloh General Albert Sidney Johnston nobly sent his surgeon back to tend to Union soldiers and then took a grievous wound that could have been stopped if said surgeon had been around but no dice. Last shot fired at Shiloh was a group of Union boys trying to take out General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was part of the cavalry rear guard to slow them down. He took a wound to his side.Shiloh had the same number of casualties as Waterloo of 1815. It convinced Grant that this was going to be a war of conquest and would therefore take a long time, not a few months as some had predicted.Ironically Shiloh is a Hebrew word that means: ""Place of peace.""First land mines and telescopic sights and repeating guns (fore runners of the machine gun) showed up in the American Civil War. Elongated bullets began the demise of the bayonet charge. High casualties were because the weapons were way ahead of the tactics.General Jackson, who never wanted a letter in transit on a Sunday, sucked on lemons constantly and kept one hand in the air constantly to stay balanced. Thirty six miles a day marches were common for his men but they faithfullfully stomped along because of his victories. At the Second Bull Run Battle Southern soldiers hurled rocks when their ammo ran out.Private Elijah Woods and other Union soldiers saw CSA General Stonewall Jackson who was entertaining ladies. They looked across at each other and Jackson even used his eyeglass but neither shot at each other. Woods said it would have been ""murder"" to do so and what use was it?General Sickles lost a leg at Gettysburg and as he was taken away his men saw him cooly smoking a cigar.General Forrest was said to have had 30 horses killed underneath him and also killed 31 men in one on one melee combat which surpasses any general on either side during the war.La Belle Rebel, the southern belle spy who charmed Union boys even after she was jailed yet she was able to smuggle secret information out in rubber balls to a contact who passed it along to Richmond.Davis, the spy who was so brave at his hanging, that the Union leader stalled in giving the order to hang him so Davis gave the order and died.Sherman and Grant, buddies going back to their old days and both Ohio boys who frowned on pomp and the like turned out to be the best Union commanders of armies.The siege of Atlanta in which President Davis and his people made the mistake of removing General Joseph E. Johnston and putting the bulldogged John Bell Hood in charge. Hood proceeded to leave the defenses and attack and lose a third of his army (20,000). At one point during the siege a Georgia bugler played so well that both sides would stop to listen.General Meigs, a true hater of the CSA (Conferate States of America), built a cemetery around Robert E. Lee's house and confiscated most of the land. It was later returned to Lee's heirs after a lawsuit but one of those heirs chose to later sell it back to the government for a tidy sum. Today this is known as the Arlington Cemetery.Grant refusing to get to the point until Lee brought it up. The scribe's hand shaking and somebody else having to write for him. Grant being polite and making conversation with Lee. Lee doffing his hat as he left the negotiations.When Edmund Ruffin (who fired the first shot of the Civil War on Sumter) found out that the CSA had conceded he wrapped himself in a CSA flag and shot himself.82 year old General Joseph E. Johnston was a pall bearer at General Sherman's funeral (they had been rivals during the war but later became friends) in 1891. As a sign of respect he kept his hat off during the cold, rainy weather, caught pneumonia and died ten days later.""Little Mac"" (General George B. McClellan became governor of New Jersey; General Beaureguard promoted railroad companies; General Forrest started the KKK but quit when it grew too violent for him; Sickles escaped court martial and gave his lost leg to the Army Historical Medical Center; General Hood died in the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878; General Pickett never got over his charge and suffered severe depression; General Longstreet joined the Republicans and dared to criticize Lee's strategy at Gettysburg and was considered traitor by his comrades in arms; in his later years General Grant's fortune was lost so he wrote his family memoirs to provide for his family; it sold half a million copies.NARRATION: A minus to A (told with letters and the like or real people during that era); EDUCATIONAL: A to A plus; HISTORICAL ACCURACY: A to A plus; OVERALL GRADE: A to A plus; WHEN WATCHED: 2011 (third viewing) (streamed)."	5.0	MY GRADE: A to A plus.	2012-06-06	2	2	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A12N6XUM5ZYLXG	"Mons ""Mons"""	Ken Burns' the Civil War is definitely the best civil war documentary, probably the best war documentary and possibly the best documentary I've ever seen, period. There are 9 episodes of just over an hour long. The main body of narrative is made up of letters, articles, memoirs, novels and diaries from the period.  Leading historians contribute stories of their own; Shelby Foote in particular - a southern gentlemen judging from his dialect - is full of laugh-out-loud anecdotes and fresh insights. My favourite is the story of the southern politician who, on the eve of the conflict, was so confident the war would be over quickly, that he offered to mop up every single drop of blood with his pocket handkerchief. Shelby Foote is sure that there's a PhD for anybody who can calculate how many pocket handkerchiefs it would have taken to mop up the blood shed during the war.The narrative is brought to life by photographs from the period - some beautiful, some startling, some terrible, but all fascinating. These are worth the admission price alone. There is also modern day film footage of the key places of the war.What is truly remarkable, however, is how this vividly this period is brought to life without a SINGLE RECONSTRUCTION. The viewer is encouraged to use his/her own imagination.And I haven't even mentioned the actors who do the voices: Morgan Freeman, Jeremy Irons, Derek Jacobi, Sam Waterston, Jason Robards to name just a few.I've seen a few documentaries about the American civil war, but Mr. Ken Burns has rendered them all obsolete. This is a shimmering beauty in the genre.	5.0	Magnificent achievement	2007-09-15	14	14	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2BXS4GU3L6RJY	MovieFann	In 1990, PBS launched an ambitious project by a young film producer, Ken Burns and his brother Ric.  The most factual and eloquently narrated (by David McCullough) story of America's most devisive and costly historical conflict whose ramifications still are debated today:  The American Civil War.From the onset of this epic we are seduced by a sweet yet sorrowful violin serenade which meanders through  introductory chapters to an almost epilogue-like closure to the many horrific post battle scenes as  eyewitness accounts are offered; field dispatches, letters (both personal and official) voiced by several well known individuals such as the great Morgan Freeman as the tenascious Abolitionist, Fredrick Douglass.  This entire production has become the benchmark from which all historical documentaries look to for perfection..........As an avid reader and follower of the Civil War I was taken back to the early years, back to the earliest days of the simmering issues of Abolition and States Rights.  Mr Burns chronicals the divide which started as festering wound to the final hemmorhage of the Union; neither victimizing nor criminalizing the moral struggles of not just the residents of the border states but also the United States Congress....Romantic ideals, ringing in the rhetoric of our political leaders and those who felt sucession and the enivitable entry into war, fuelled the fatal belief that each side was right.The battle scenes were enhanced by soundtracks so realistic you feel that you were there-the voices of combatants, exploding cannon shells, the clash of sabers during Calvary charges, gunshots and screams of their victims as they fell as leaves in the fall........Voices of the great Commanders, Generals and President Lincoln attest to the uncertainty of the widespread slaughter and the yearning for its end.  Many times I felt the fear and horror that our soldiers must have felt upon being led to certain death (witness the horrific battles of the Wilderness, Antietam and Cold Harbor)  This was the most emotional, costly yet defining event in the young evolution of our United States.....Many of our greatest Military as well as Political leaders participated in this conflict....witness the wisdom imparted (much which has also become inscriptions on statues, placques and quotes in American History books today) both on and off the battlefield.  I believe it was a great Roman General (if not Ceasar himself) who spoke that &#34;only the dead know the end of war&#34;In closing, this is the GREATEST cinematic presentation on the Civil War; painstakingly researched, professionally presented, delightfully enhanced by opinions of renowned Civil War Historians (Shelby Foote was the best!!!!) with a hauntingly beautiful musical score--Ken Burns has offered a look into perhaps the most tumultous and devastating period in our history--and in doing so, united us in the knowledge that &#34;a House divided cannot stand.....&#34;	5.0	A House Divided	2013-01-27	1	1	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3ELA14YZQ0NE7	Mr Baz	I bought this set many years back having been glued to the TV watching the series before. Over the years I have watched this many times, and continue to learn more and more about the details of the Civil War.But more than anything, Ken Burns has succeeded in making this a very &#34;human&#34; and personal film, which not only exposes some of the questionable choices made in terms of strategy and politics, but the tragic and human suffering the conflict inflicted upon so many.Expertly filmed Burns manages to bring still photographs to life using his now famous &#34;Burns effect&#34; slowly panning across photographs, zooming in, each and every picture is given maximum impact just from a single still image. Narrated by David McCullough, who has a voice that grips you with every word and phrase, there are also some wonderful additions by many others including:Morgan FreemanJason RobardsLaurence FishburneArthur MillerJeremy Irons and many othersNarration is flawless from the entire castA special mention must go to the historian Shelby Foote, his well thought out and often witty sections add greatly to the impact of the series. His intelligent and yet sometimes touched responses sweep past any of the usual rhetoric you might expect from some historians, and he's well grounded and down to earth, with an expert knowledge of the conflict. All wrapped up in a wonderful and soft Tennessee accent. You could listen to Shelby all day longStructure is excellent, starting off in the pre conflict stage, moving along to many of the well known battles and giving a good coverage of the political struggles of the era right up the conclusion and aftermath. This is an in depth documentary that covers the conflict in nice bite sized episodes.At 11 hours 30 minutes running time this is a beast in terms of watching hours.What stands out above all else is the ability of Burns, and the narrators to bring the individual stories to life. Letters are frequently read out by the cast, images and stories of ordinary people, soldiers, slaves. Not just Lincoln, Lee, Grant and the big headline people. It would have been very easy to make a film that covered events purely on a grand scale, and with less details or without the personal stories that go with the conflict. Burns manages to make this a touching and thoughtful documentary, and yet whilst it is detailed, it never bogs you down; accurate and with counter viewpoints helping the viewer form their own opinion.Rarely is such a film easy to do, clearly a labour of love of Burns this has achieved a near faultless account of the conflict. If you have even a mild interest in the Civil War it's an essential purchase, even if you don't it's a compelling watch for just about everyone.One of the few documentary films that really does achieve epic statusHighly recommended	5.0	The definitive documentary of the American Civil War	2014-07-06	0	0	0

Having the comments by the late Shelby Foote is a stroke of genius, Mr. Foote is the author of a three volume history of the Civil War and so lends authority to many of the historical happenings and comments by many of the people involved in fighting the war.I have been a student of the civil war and have visited many of the battlefields and so have learned quite a lot about the whole four years of this war, but what I learned from this set is totally amazing. One thing that is outstanding in this commemorative DVD set is that it has subtitles for the hearing impaired, I now have a very serious hearing impairment, so the original tape version is no good to me now, but this new edition is a godsend, for anyone who has a hearing impairment and wants a history of the Civil War I absolutely recommend this DVD set.	5.0	Civil War	2014-03-23	0	0	0

That some of the pictures ended up in green houses sold for glass value only. BUT someone saved many of the photographs.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AIRIOO6LD1OO1	Neil Roger Chertcoff	This is a classic series millions saw  in early 90s and see today.Its strengths are it runs a strong , specific  accurate  time line and the  key events keptwell in focus. also it gets into the differences of not just the politics , societybut also the  strongly related culture and lives of people from the North and the Southincluding mainly the hoi palloi.Its weakness is it touts too much for the idealistic ideological reasons used  to 'justify'  thistitanic struggle , , 'freedom' (really for who ? and for what purposes?), ' Our Way of life?'but who  reaps the benefits - who suffers from this ?)  and that most thepeoples ,who really  bore the brunt of the  conflagration , actually gained very little at all  then,whether in the North or the South . But Others , in the States elites though, found waysto make huge profits and power from the  horrendous  and continuing sacrificesof others..The pictures and filming done and the series  narrators are pretty good, folksy, but give a surface viewat how those in the North and South look back at this today . But I would still say thatBOTH have a bit too apologetic, polyannish  blurred  vision  and  a failure to face what the war(admittedly inevitable!) brought out  in both its GAINS  and LOSSES  for the peoples of the nationas the USA really became the 'United States  of America' , a rising up  mightyindustrial - political giant.Back when I was  a teacher I got to show a  few parts  of this series to the studentsand most stayed  quiet,  eyes glued to the screen and actually  learned a few good thingsabout US history . That's better than I could say for most their  history text books, videos , thatare really boring , inaccurate, thinly veiled baby food  propaganda, whiney pap , +slick  cover ups, etc..	3.0	Ken Burns  classic documentary on he US Civil War	2014-04-21	0	0	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1HVRHZSD1A5F6	Nerdy Woman	Although it's been 20+ years since this documentary series was made, it still has the power to inform, entertain, and evoke an emotional response. It's been some years since I first saw it, but watched again on Amazon Instant Videos with my 16-year-old daughter. Ken Burns assembled an all-star cast to narrate diaries, letters, and quotes from various people who lived through this most dramatic, tragic, and nation-changing event. Since the first time I saw it, I've never been able to think about the Gettysburg Address without hearing Sam Waterston's voice in the role of Abraham Lincoln.Burns doesn't just tell the history many of us know from textbooks, he brings Shelby Foote's incredible trilogy to life with photographs, but he created what became known as the &#34;Burns effect&#34; by making 150-yr-old pictures &#34;move.&#34; Foote researched individual stories and anecdotes that put flesh on what could otherwise be a dry recitation of a very long military event. You'll be disgusted by the pompous George McClellan, delighted by the sardonic wit of William Tecumseh Sherman, and amazed by the brilliance, stupidity, and arrogance of military leaders on both sides.The only thing missing from this very watchable series are the interviews with Ken Burns that were originally aired on PBS. I still remember how he told of &#34;saving President Lincoln&#34; for one brief moment before they filmed/narrated the assassination and the emotional reaction of the production crew as that event was relived.This is a must see series. It's the benchmark by which all others documentaries should be measured. Watch with your kids who think they hate history because it's storytelling that far surpasses any fiction.	5.0	Still the most incredible documentary ever made.	2013-09-04	0	0	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A16WN78OWPXBTY	New Kindle Reader	After having watched this series several times, I still am moved by it.  Burns tells the story of the Civil War in a variety of ways.  The photographs are powerful tools in bringing the history to life in a way that narration could not do alone, even the distinguished narration of David McCullough.  The reading of the words of many of the famous historical characters involved provide a special glimpse into the era, particularly Sam Waterston as Lincoln, Morgan Freeman as Frederick Douglass, and Arthur Miller as General Sherman.  But it is ordinary citizens (Mary Chestnut, Elisha Hunt Rhodes, and Sam Watkins) whose insight is most informative.  We should not overlook the perspectives of Shelby Foote for details and Barbara Fields for a more global view.The music provides a poignant underpinning to the entire series -- not just the beautiful Ashokan Farewell!  The piano playing and arrangements of Jacqueline Schwab are both inspiring and touching!Anyone with an interest in history or the United States would find this truly must see TV!	5.0	Wish I could give it 10 stars!	2014-05-16	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AMNPFW5GRHCM9	Nick	"I've been a reenactor and Civil War enthusiast for about 7 years now and I finally purchased and watched Ken Burns's The Civil War.  While I believe the word ""disappointed"" is a bit too strong, it IS the best documentary on the war, but its no more than a primer.  In some respects, it appears to skim over the meat of the material like a high school history textbook, while at other times throwing in details, seemingly merely for trivia.  Putting the film up against, say, James McPherson's book Battle Cry of Freedom, considered as the best single volume book on the Civil War, Burns's film comes off as lacking.  No doubt, time-frames existed for the film, and a documentary on any one of the important battles may easily consume 11 hours, and it may also be unfair to compare a book and a film, I still feel that more could information of interest could have been added to make the story more well-rounded and in-depth. I understand that Burns may not have wanted to get bogged down in details and maybe also feared losing peoples' interest on that path, but I still feel more should have been included.In saying that however, I reiterate that this is the best documentary on the war and admit that I may be asking too much of not only a film, but one which covers such a vast expanse.  Judging it for what it is, instead of what it is not, it is outstanding.  Its breadth of commentary is enormous and Burns admirably attempts to cover many aspects of the rebellion.  I was delighted to see pictures I had never seen before and many times paused the film to go find them for my own records. The voices seemed to me to be spot on, exactly as I would imagine any one of the personalities to be.  Sam Waterson as Lincoln... of course!  The personal letters and diaries of the average folk add a great deal to the emotional aspect of the film.  While initially I thought Burns should have considered more sources, as there are millions of touching accounts covering just about everything, it did work well that he stuck with a few and followed them throughout the conflict as he no doubt intended.I don't think I could add anymore to a product review that 99 other people have not already covered on such a popular film, so I will end this here.  I would recommend this film to any and all, and even if its the only civil war subject material you view or read, it will serve you quite well."	4.0	Outstanding	2009-08-13	13	9	4

Ken Burns can capture life as no one else can. To take still photographs and make you feel you can see the people moving in them is a talent very few have. The soulful musical background makes you ache. Narration that is so moving by actors like Morgan Freeman and story telling by historians such as Shelby Foote. So many stories such as, most of these ""soldiers"" hadn't ever been off the farm, some as young as 15. Over 600,000 dying and about two thirds from disease. And then of course the major fight over slavery and all the intricacies of that. I love this series and am watching it for the fourth or fifth time."	5.0	The Civil War/Ken Burns	2012-01-05	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3U4VUSBJMR5KP	Patrick A. Hayden	I remember watching this documentary by Ken Burns when it first appeared on PBS in 1990.  It started my lifelong interest in the Civil War.  Countless books and trips to battlefields later, it still stands as the finest general work on the war ever made.The story of the war is told through pictures, narratives, and the unobtrusive narration by David McCoulough, who's voice is pitch pefect for the job.  Never before have photos had such a dramatic effect in telling a story.  They say a picture says a thousand words, and this series prove that maxim correct.  The five discs cover the 5 years of the war, and the 9 parts of teh series.  The most effective are &quot;1861: The Cause&quot;, &quot;1863: The Universe of Battle&quot;, and &quot;1865: The Better Angels of our Nature&quot;.  They cover the events that led up to the war, the turining points at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, and the end and aftermath of the war.  Each is suprememly emotional.  One episode intersperses an old narrative from the daughter of a former slave as she remembers her father's stories.  Shelby Foote, author of the most comprehensive book on the war, offers invaluable advice.  High praise must also go to Sam Waterston, who voices Abraham Lincoln.  In the final segment of the 1863 disc, Waterston recites the Gettysburg Address, and I must admit it brought me to tears.The music is also a key factor to the success of the film.  Burns went back and found the old music that was popular among the people and the soldiers, both North &amp; South during the war.  It is moving, from the haunting opening music, to the old spirituals that are found on disc 2's &quot;1862: Forever Free&quot;.  Add that to a stable of great voice actors, (besides Waterston, Morgan Freeman as Frederick Douglass and George Plimpton as George Tempelton Strong are standouts), and the film becomes almost magical, transporting the viewer to those 4 horrible years that changed the Nation forever.The Civil War is the most important saga in American History, and this documentary gives the people who fought it and the effect the War had on the US as a people the proper historical weight and respect.  It deserves a place on any amatuer historians shelf.	5.0	Can I give it More than 5 stars?	2002-10-31	83	80	3

The original series itself was released in 3 versions: complete (with varying episode lengths), slighly shortened (to provide similar length shows) and short version (about 1 hour per episode.  The slightly shortened version was the one initially distributed on Video and DVD.  This is the one that has the wobbly transfer.  The new DVD version (2003) is a digitally enhanced full release.  Ken Burns returned to the original film to achieve a new hi-resolution transfer and then proceded to digitally clean it up.  This is demonstrated in a mini-doco on the DVD.  No one questions the quality of the series and with this release the reproduction quality matches it. Ken Burns turned me into a Civil War buff and collector.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3637SI6DIHPJT	Paul-Joseph Stines	Ken Burns is a good documentary film maker. It's amazing what they have done in this documentary set just using old photographs, voice overs and interviews. The interviews with Shelby Foote alone make owning this set worthwhile. But, like everything about the Civil War it is very biased and, like most things on the war, it is very politically correct. But this review is not about the content of the program; I knew what it contained before I bought it. This review is about the physical DVD set, which was very disappointing.This product is fulfilled by a Third Party vendor. The set arrived very promptly and was well packaged and appeared to be in good condition. However, several of the programs freeze at the same points every time you watch them. Most of them simply freeze, you resolve it and the program plays on. However, some of the episodes freeze every few seconds, making watching them impossible past that point. Amazon's Third Party vendors do not have to follow the same procedures that Amazon follows for resolving such issues. I had a problem with an Amazon product once, they immediately sent out a replacement. I returned the defective one and everything was resolved quickly and easily. However, in this case, the Third Party vendor would reimburse me for all costs including shipping after receiving the returned product. Then, if I chose to do so, I would have had to reorder the DVD set again. They refused to just replace it with another set when I requested they do so.I decided not to return the set. The turnaround time for returning the defective set, getting reimbursed, ordering another set and waiting for it to arrive, seemed more trouble than it was worth, and then there was no guarantee it would be any better, if not worse. There are 5 DVDs containing 9 programs. Most are watchable, although not nearly as enjoyable. Only 2 programs freeze so badly they are unwatchable. I am more concerned with the vendor's unwillingness to simply send me a replacement. I have shopped with Amazon for years and have made quite a few purchases, and I've never had a problem with Amazon. However, except for books, I don't think I will be making any more purchases through Amazon's Third Party vendors.	2.0	Civil War Bummer	2011-12-07	15	4	11

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A17BT73RVRQYSP	Peter Ingemi	Ken Burns first effort was simply a masterpiece.  I am a history buff who had very little interest in the civil war.  Mr. Burns changed that, (With some help from Shelby Foote.)  The history is great.  The actors for the voices were well picked, and most important the EDITING made this film.  As I recall before this film it was rare that a picture featuring primarly stil photos.  It started a flow of imitators.This film like A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM  was made a classic in the editing room.  (And I'll wager nobody ever figured you could put these two films in a relevent sentence together.)  The technique of focusing on a figure in a shot, then a second shot pulled back, then a final shot of the whole scene added drama (unlike Forum who's cuts added farce.) and brought the story alive.Burns duplicated his winning ways in BASEBALL but this one stands above the rest as the trailblazer.	5.0	Well filmed well acted well worth the price	2001-09-07	4	3	1

Now, I have the time and interest to learn about the Civil War and do more research.  Ken Burns' film is a montage of still photographs that are extremely sensitive to the casualties of war.  That any of these photos were ever taken with the crude equipment under difficult circumstances is remarkable.  War photographers can bring aspects of war that no tale can tell.  I find this DVD set absolutely riveting, and fair.  I am enchanted by the dialogue with Mr. Shelby Foote.  Something every American should watch and absorb.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A27KNX6B1GSHKL	Polymath	"Ken Burns's ""Civil War"" begins with the election of Lincoln and the pressures that drove an increasingly beleagured South to secede and form the Confederacy. It ends with Lincoln's assassination and the nation's belated recognition that we had lost one of the greatest statesmen and wartime presidents of all time. Between the beginning of the war and the end, Burns gives us a panoramic view of events, through the eyes of politicians, generals, private soldiers, citizens, and slaves. The narrative is gripping, given increasing fascination by the horror and drama of Americans shooting each other to bits on the battlefield and by ingenious use of music and cinematography. Burns pans over still photos, creating the suggestion of a moving picture. The same musical motifs are used repetitively, which sounds like it could become dull, but instead creates an emotional bond with certain events. For example, Lincoln has thematic music, while Southern battlefield victories are celebrated with a joyous rendition of ""Dixie."" Overall is a hauntingly beautiful theme for violin and guitar, which opens and closes each episode. The clash of armies in the East is thoroughly documented, while the Western campaign is also included, with descriptions of such battles as Shiloh, Vicksburg, and Chickamauga.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A26JP9Z2Y0ZNXG	Poor old dad	First, let me say I originally recorded this series on VHS tapes when it was first broadcast.  Second, about a year or so of watching my tapes, I bought the VHS series.  Finally, when VHS tapes went the way of the dinosaur, I bought the series on DVD.Yes, there may be a few inaccuracies through the programs, but taken as a whole, Ken Burns has brought the American Civil War to life in a very accessible and understandable manner. Everything about it is top notch, from the chronological scripting, to the spoken text, to the music.  This is Mr. Burns' Opus!I watch this series multiple times through the year and every time, it sparks something new for me, prompting me to dig further.  In my library, I have somewhere between 500 and 600 books on the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln alone.  I have traveled to hear Ken Burns speak (and if you ever have the chance, please do so as he is unlike other authors/film makers as he does not simply rehash what he has done).  I have also attended the &#34;Civil War Institute&#34; at Gettysburg College.  I am not a re-enactor, with my interest being in the study of the time surrounding the Civil War, events leading up to it and reconstruction afterwards.This series is a must have for all that have any interest in this time in American history, from the most serious to those with just casual, passing interest.  If I could give it more than 5 starts I would as it is that good!	5.0	Quit reading the reviews and just buy it	2014-02-25	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3FWGY4A33WKFM	P. Zeller	Simply put, Civil War,by Ken Burns, set the standard for making in-depth documentaries when it came out 20 years ago, a standard that is seldom met and has never been challenged since.The depth of detail, the cinematography (especially as it is applied to a subject with no existing film footage and highly variable still photography quality), the over-all structure and delivery of the entire sequence, as well as the ability to have the viewer connect with individuals, on a personal level, from which they have only distant history in common, are all still traits that are seldom matched and have never been bettered by a documentary before or since. That likely even holds true for Ken Burns' work which has followed this seminal series(all which demonstrate a true master in the craft).This series belongs in every American's video library as well as anyone who professes an interest in History in general. Likewise, this film should be a starting point for anyone studying the fine points of film making.	5.0	The Benchmark of Documentaries	2012-01-17	3	3	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3ANXF0LF4Y4IC	R. Adams	Where to begin ? I've always enjoyed reading books on war from the age of 10 and up. As a child my father made a point of taking me to some of the major US Historical locations eg Gettysburg, Monticello and Mt. Vernon NY and thereby stoked my love of history. Ken Burns Civil War tells in plain terms the facts that lead up to the war and then through surviving photographs and plates depicts the actual aftermath of various battles. This combined with excellent narrative by a myriad of actors can at times send shivers up your spine.The major impression I came away with was how totally convinced each side was about the virtues of their position that culminated in one the bloodiest war ever fought on North American soil.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2ZD6Z16JWL8HU	Randy Funderburke	The Ken Burns saga never gets old.  From the haunting music and the grainy photographs, to the written and spoken prose of America's best patriots and finest historians, the epic confrontation that ironically divided families but solidified a nation is displayed in gripping detail.  While the horror has faded over time and that time has healed our wounds, the contradiction of emotions while viewing never ceases to amaze.  A century and a half after the event and we Johnny Rebs still take pride in the early and often victories, even though the final outcome is no longer in doubt.  Out-manned, out-resourced, out-gunned and underdogged, the Rebel Yell kept raining down for four years.  And in any state south of the Mason-Dixon line, the flag still flies as a symbol of pride for most, and sadly,  racism for a few.  Neither side should ever forget the four years and over 600,000 lives because those are the ingredients of freedom for which we enjoy.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AUZ6TLLO882VB	Rebecca	One of the best (video) presentations of the Civil War that I've seen, it's long enough  to go into measured detail about many areas of how the war affected both sides of the divide during and after. A large cast of very good voice actors bring to life an impressive collection of quotations from primary source documents of Civil War witnesses and participants. Music was put to tasteful use, too, as well as an extensive photo archive. The subject is handled overall in a respectful, sensitive way: honoring the loss and suffering of everyone involved, addressing the historical significance of the war and its implications for the future of our nation, and assessing the choices made in an academic, unbiased voice.My main criticisms are only due to the two large holes in Burns' narrative. It's understandable given the huge topic that this series couldn't cover everything, but very significant details were left out: firstly, the role of the Union and CSA navies was all but ignored (a short bit about the construction and success of the Monitor is about all we get) when the blockades and coastal confrontations of the civil war were very significant factors in its outcomes. Secondly, this series, while progressing for some time into the post-war unified America, essentially handwaves the period of reconstruction, which was arguably a more significant and complex period that permanently affected our nation. Instead, we get a &#34;where are they now&#34; of two dozen or so of the people we came to know during their wartime stories, which is nice, but is completely lacking in the context of a nation spasming for decades with economic devastation and social disorder.For the style, detail, clarity, and dignity with which this series addresses the topic, however, it's an excellent piece, and is, in my opinion, an essential education for anyone wanting to truly understand the American Civil War.	4.0	A Beautiful Series	2014-01-03	1	1	0

This series takes you there with insightful commentary and photos that reveal the outward character of the important people in charge and their involvement in the planning of the battles.Watching this series you can't help but feel for the many nameless thousands on both sides who shed their blood, lost a limb or were buried without fanfare for their heroic behavior over a cause that seemed clouded in politics, strained, nebulous and increasingly ill-defined as the war raged on.A highly recommended visual history lesson that is not for the squeamish.	5.0	One of Ken Burns best	2013-07-22	1	1	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1O130H3XTF5WF	Richard Buck	I have spent quite a bit of my learning time in the past two years focusing on the Civil War, wanting to get a better handle on the whole thing. I watched movies, read books, listened to books on tape, listened to college lectures, recorded and watched shows from the History Channel and PBS. I visited Civil War battlefields at Gettysburg and in Virginia and Tennessee.Throughout this, I used Ken Burns' film as my guide to keep things straight. I think I have watched every part of this film at least twice, and it never let me down.Burns, whom I once heard give a lecture at Willamette University, found what in my opinion was just the right way to weave elements of learning into a compelling fabric that never bores. I loved getting to listen to and see historians like Shelby Foote. I loved the photographs, the music, the animated battlefield sequences. The many quotations from letters and diaries of participants, read by such familiar voices as Garrison Keillor, lent the whole project an unmistakable credibility.Finally, no review could do justice to this film without lauding the narration of David McCullough.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	R. Nicholson	Having just finished watching The Civil War by Ken Burns I felt I had to review it. The DVD, on 6 discs, encompass the entire civil war from beginning to end, including important events that preceded the firing of the first shot.In the end, the union won of course, but was somewhat lucky to do so: despite continually squandering the advantage of numerical superiority and the innumerable opportunities they had for victory.Although it is difficult to describe what so compelling and addictive about this work, I believe, one of the factors is the beauty of the story telling. The main portion of the series in simply nothing more than old black and white photographs captured by photographers of the day; images with a ghostly, grainy quality that makes for a special eerie affect. I do not think colored pictures, somehow, would have been effective in creating the mood that these B &W; photos do: simple images of men in their barracks, in front of a tent, on a horse etc. or sometimes grotesque scenes of death and destruction after a battle. The fact that so many of these images survived is a miracle in itself.Just as important is the beautiful, narrative voice of David McCullough and others historians who give expert commentary and actors who read letters written by people involved in this event.However, in my opinion, it is the music that sets this epic event apart from any other work on the same topic. The Ashoken Farewell by Jay Ungar begins each installment: it is hard to imagine a more fitting piece of music that could preface each episode: this haunting melody, played by a solo violin, seems to capture the raw essence of the story so perfectly: it simply seems to reach out and touch the soul.  The majority of the music accompanying the story is played by solo guitar, piano, banjo or violin: and again the singular instrument seems much more appropriate than orchestrated music: capturing the ever increasing loneliness and solitude that these men must have felt as the war dragged on throughout these four years.All in all, the photographs, the narrative, and the music blend together to make an unforgettable 10 hour series that surly is one of the most important events not only in American history, but maybe even more importantly, for the entire world.	5.0	The Civil War:  Ken Burns masterpiece	2003-01-26	9	9	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A39GV4G05ANQEW	"Robert A. Johnson ""Bob Johnson - bobjohnson.w..."	"It's been many years since originally glued to I think HBO to watch this magnificent portrayal of the fight between the gray and the blue.  It is a bit pricey, but it is polished and insightful. When I purchased it, I'd just finished reading ""The Civil War"" by Bruce Catton, and the Catton Trilogy on the Civil War, and I realized I simply had to re-watch this engaging film by Ken Burns.Ken Burns I think started the era of talking heads and documentary's using experts along the way.  It works well in his film (but I do wish others would find another way - it is getting old).  There is one man in this film, Shelby Foote who is just priceless.  He knows how southerners feel about the war, and northerners who think the civil war over, while correct, underestimate the feelings of loss that are present in the south.At one point Foote discusses how proud many Americans are of our record in wars.  ""We have never lost"" many think and say.  I paraphrase Foote now; he says with an ironic look on his face, ""Not in the South"".  I've found that talk of the Civil War in social circles is a topic best left at the door.  I've been told in no uncertain terms, after bringing it up is some way, ""We don't talk about that down here"".  I recall vividly being surprised and feeling foolish.  Later I wondered why, for I see the Civil Was as a great tragedy and example of the failure of compromise, and the lack of will to solve very difficult problems.  We must learn how to deal with supposedly insolvable problems.The Civil War is also an excellent example of how a war must be fought, and, the power of resources and logistics.  The north had many generals who were the bane of Lincoln's life; generals who may have been sympathetic to the southern cause and unwilling to slaughter people with whom they agreed.  McClellan is the primary example of a fumbling pompous man who thought of himself as Savior and real president and commander and chief.  While Lincoln bemoaned their behavior - he had to lose sleep over his judgment and ability to appoint real fighting men - he knew the north could not lose if only he could get the army to fight.  And then along came Grant and Sherman.Lee recognized that without manpower, supplies, and transportation he had to whittle away at the will of northerners, lowering their will to fight to a point where resignation to the idea of a Confederacy might win for his beloved Virginia and the south.  His swift and incisive victory's almost carried the day.  And then along came Grant and Sherman.The Battle of Richmond with Grant continuously moving to outflank Lee on the left, and Lee anticipating the move and beating back Grant, demonstrates Lee's warrior skills and Grant's willingness to keep the fight going.  Grant knew he could not loss; eventually Lee would run out of men, literally, and supplies.Sherman waged total war.  (We might think about this offensive before going to war.  Can this nation repeat it?  Is it a necessity in order to win a war?)  The obliteration of cities, towns and fields and people,  put an effective end to the war for the south lost its base of supply and I think realized the war would be lost.  This was especially true in South Carolina; Sherman punished the state for leading the secessionists to fight.This invitation to review ""The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns"" comes with an urge to watch it yet again.  The playing of Ashokan Farewell while reading a soldier's letter home to Sarah, his wife, and his acceptance of his coming death, is a stunning and emotional point in the film.  There are many others, and I will watch it again, and urge you to do so as well.[...]"	5.0	Pricey But Polished and Insightful	2009-03-11	0	0	0

I made my 16 year old son watch it with me, and, he was more moved by my emotion than by the film, I think. The stark beauty of the presentation, balanced by the unimaginable horror that gripped our land 137 years ago was both eloquent and artistic in its' presentation. As a Vietnam combat veteran, my heart reached out to all the men on both sides for the incredible hardship they endured and their single minded devotion to duty and their comrads. Lincoln's greatness is magnified and examined and one is left in awe of his single minded purpose, which was to keep us a house undivided. As brilliant as Ken Burns' film making abilities are, however, he is ill advised on the issue of slavery and its' place in the cause and continuation of the war. It is almost as if he has a racial agenda with his films. His misunderstanding of the true causes of The Civil War are, sadly, the result of a historical agenda that was set in place long ago in an attempt to assign a higher morality to the reasons the north fought other than union preservation. The record clearly reveals that those who followed the battle flag of freedom were southerners who were rebelling against unfair taxation and representation, just as their own father's had done against the British. Shelby Foote's quotation by the poor southern farm boy who, when captured by yankees, told them he was fighting because ""your down here"" pretty much says it all. Let us be reminded that the first act of aggression, that started the fighting, was Lincoln's ordering of the blockading of southern ports. There was not a single piece of legislation before congress that threatened the right of southern states with regards to slavery."	4.0	Brilliant, but, Biased	2002-09-27	15	9	6

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	This is a superb film, combining the emotion evoked from images and selected narratives (wonderfully read by great actors) as well as some analysis by prominent scholars or writers. So far as it goes, Burns has exploited the attributes of the film medium to what I believe is the maximum extent: you leave this experience with a good idea of what went on and how it changed the country. It is moving, horrible, and beautiful all at once.That being said, I believe that Burns was also very conscious of what the film medium could accomplish less well, i.e. the deeper scholarly treatment that can only be plumbed from the concentration and effort that books demand. That is where some of the reviewers here went wrong IMHO, as they expected more than a film can reasonably deliver. This is not a university lecture and there is not enough space to explore all the details as they might deserve. Nonetheless, I did not find any glaring inaccuracies or unacceptable biases - it was a good critical bit of work.What you get with Burns is a taste of the Civil War, some clear ideas, and feelings about what happened. For real depth of understanding, the viewer will have to go elsewhere, and that is fine. After all, this is a life long labor of love for some of us Civil War buffs.I watched this while my son (7) played next to me, and every so often he would look up and ask questions about what was portrayed - it was a nice bonding medium, got him thinking a bit, and engraved certain images into his mind. Just what I wanted, while I went over the outlines of hte Civil War again.Warmly recommended as an outstanding starting point.	5.0	excellent introduction, but only as a starting point	2006-07-05	17	14	3

He took the history of the Civil War period and brought it to life with dialogue and very early photographs.  It was well balanced, covering both the Uniontroops and the Rebel troops.  It talked about the complicated reasons for fighting a civil war; the development of the Union army and the Southern army; a detailed account of the major battles; and the end of the war.  The impossible role of governing a torn nation was also sensitively explored.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	Ken Burn's THE CIVIL WAR was a watershed moment in the history of television documentary.  The influence of this series can hardly be overstated, with a horde of documentaries on PBS and The History Channel adopting many of the techniques that Burn's mastered here.  When the series was first broadcast on PBS in 1990, I was utterly enchanted--along with millions of others--with the unique blend of narration by David McCullough, archival photographs combined with contemporary location shots, lines from famous individuals read by professional actors and other celebrities, sound effects, commentary by professional historians, and beautiful music that contained just a touch of melancholy.  I had never seen anything like it, and the only things I have seen like it since have shamelessly imitated it.The DVDs not only provide a superior copy of the original series, but also contain a number of excellent features, including additional interviews and a wealth of other goodies.  I had rewatched much of the series on video, but I found the color somewhat off.  The DVD is a great improvement.There are so many things to praise about this series.  It isn't perfect, and not all will agree with the emphases.  The interpretation follows fairly consistently that of James McPherson and Shelby Foote who saw slavery as the root cause of the war, unlike previous generations of historians who out of a respect to Southerners (I'm a Southerner, for the record, though I now live in Chicago) de-emphasized slavery and identified the cause of the war more with states's rights than slavery.  But what can't be argued is the brilliantly vivid way that Burns and his collaborators manage to bring back to life a time long past.  There are countless photographs and not just those by &quot;Matthew Brady&quot; (most of the photographs attributed to Brady where taken by his assistants, primarily Alexander Gardner, who deserves the reputation that Brady has), but from all over the United States.  All the disparate elements are blended seamlessly to produce a nearly unblemished surface.The quality of the voice-overs was, at the time of this series release, utterly unprecedented.  A host of well-known individuals were used in the readings, but the principle ones were Sam Waterson as Abraham Lincoln, Julie Harris as Mary Chestnut, Jason Robards as Ulysses S. Grant, Morgan Freeman as Frederick Douglas, Garrison Keillor as Walt Whitman, journalist Charley McDowell as Private Sam Watkins, George Plimpton as George Templeton Strong, and a host of others.  My favorite may be playwright Arthur Miller, who marvelously provides the gruff voice for the remarkable statements by William Tecumseh Sherman.But despite all this excellence, one person managed to steal the whole show:  Shelby Foote.  It is simply shocking that amidst all these riches that many of the greatest moments of the show consisted of a lone Southern historian reflecting on the meaning of the war.  Foote, although well known for his monumental narrative history of the war, was more or less an unknown.  But the series made him a media star, a role that he refused to take on or exploit.  Of the ten greatest moments on the series, perhaps seven of them involve Foote, whether explaining that the Civil War was the central event of American history, that it made us a nation (before the war people would say &quot;the United States are&quot; but afterwards they say &quot;the United States is&quot;), or eloquently talking of the brilliance of Nathan Bedford Forrest, or stating that Gettysburg was the cost the South had to pay for having Robert E. Lee lead the Army of Northern Virginia.  He was partly his Southern drawl, partly his remarkable ability to distilling a point to its essence, and partly his mastery of words.The great thing about this series is that even if you have read such classics as Douglas Southall Freeman's LEE'S LIEUTENANTS and his four-volume biography of Lee, McPherson's BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, and Foote's THE CIVIL WAR, Burn's documentary will make the war come alive in a completely new and exciting way.  This set will therefore be essential viewing for all serious students of the Civil War, as well as nearly anyone even remotely curious about American history, or, for that matter, great television.	5.0	The birth of the modern television documentary	2003-11-12	33	30	3
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	ATPKIKB3T6UB6	Roberto Silva	Anything that Ken Burns works on is a work of art and this Commemorative Edition of The Civil War is no exception.  In essence, it is a total work of art that brings the Civil War into the Modern Age Period.  The pictures, the music, and the narrative is totally well done and makes one feel as if one is there viewing the Civil War of front during the Civil War itself.  The Commemorative starts from the inception of the problems that started the conflict to the end of the Civil War itself.  And at every change of the turmoil the pictures change with it, as well as the music.  And the music chosen by Mr. Burns is music of the Civil War period and performed by period instruments.  And each change of periods that Mr. Burns has chosen, go in sequence to the periods of the Civil War as if one is reading a History book in class.  Each change is correctly following the sequence of events as if written in a History book and being a History buff, each event is correctly supported by historical facts, and historical documentation, not to mention, the Civil War music in the background that gives the narrative an excellent sense of one being given a tour of an actual Civil War site or an actual Civil War conflict itself.  In essence, I highly recommend The Civil War (Commemorative Edition) by Mr. Ken Burns highly, and every History buff, Library, or Civil War Historian should have one in their libraries or collection for Historical reference.	5.0	Excellent Commemorative Edition	2014-03-04	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A253GAS0ECQRAJ	Robert Postal	Things to note. The series is justifiably given its due as a seminal documentary.But I couldn't adjust the CD's format on my HD television, or my TV's format to the CDs. Consequently, heads, text, and scenes were cropped. More than annoying, some scenes were just not watchable. And, maybe it is my expectations in the year 2013, but the audio and video technology these days just seemed to make this performance seem a little dated.I received this set as a gift so I was going to keep it on my bookshelf but the # 1 CD was damaged. When I returned it, I could not get a new set since it was sold out and not available in the future. I received a credit; thank you Amazon. So, all's well that end's well.There are many fine and more recent books and films on the Civil War; I recommend that you pass on this one (again, if you can get it because I was told that you can't) and like the high school sweetheart, let this series live in your memory.	2.0	There's better ways to learn about the Civil War	2013-08-06	2	0	2

Slavery was an abomination, and should never have been included in the Constitution language in the first place, but I understand it had to be put in as a compromise to get the approval of all the members of the Constitutional Convention.  Other than the issues on slavery, BOTH sides in the Civil War were justified in their actions,  I do didagree with many of the actions of President Lincoln as they were 'blatantly Unconstitutional'.  Again, I understand why he did it, but it still makes much of his actions and words about the Nation and the Constitution a mockery of the entire process.  The entire affair was a sad event in our nations history and a waste of life.  I could go on, writing a novel of the good and bad on the events and actions of the Civil War, but I shant.

I never tire of watching it, whether my local PBS station is running it, or watching my  very used videotapes! It's not just the wonderful photographs, the actors  reading the words of those who were there, or even the historians bringing  their considerable expertise to us. Throughout the documentary, it is  evident how much the whole subject of the Civil War meant to the makers of  the film.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2WSI8HOWHFDOT	Rocco Dormarunno	"How anyone could not appreciate this tremendous documentary is beyond comprehension. Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" gives us an unforgettable look at a country tearing itself apart, piece by piece. Beginning with the death knell that clanged as each state seceded from the Union, we are prepared for the disaster that would be the Civil War. The countless haunting images of battlefields and hospitals, the photos of amputated limbs in an ambulatory waste can are shocking but powerful. The short section entitled ""Now, Fix Me"" is so heartbreaking, it reminds the viewer how these men suffered and how they paid the ultimate price.What must also be appreciated is that Brooklyn-born Ken Burns relied so much on southerner Shelby Foote's analysis of the war. While it may be argued that Burns relied too much on the late Shelby Foote, who better to turn to? Anyone who's read his extensive, three-volume history of the war between the states will recognize that he was the best resource at the time. In fact, I would highly recommend reading Foote's trilogy after watching this film.The cast of actors, actresses, and singers who provided the voices are so near-perfect as to be nothing short of inspired. Sam Waterson's Abraham Lincoln, particularly his reading of the Gettysburg Address and Lincoln's second inaugural speech, is very moving to say the least. In fact, this entire documentary is so moving and informative that Ken Burns could not top it in his later documentaries. While his Jazz and Baseball films are very good, they pale in comparison to ""The Civil War"". But how could they surpass it given the epic scope of America's darkest years?"	5.0	So good, even Burns could not top it.	2006-10-25	5	4	1

It certainly is one of the better ones.  This film, which contains no dramatization or re-enactments, nevertheless does a wonderful job of explaining both the political and military dimensions of the greatest conflict ever fought in the New World, and the greatest struggle in American history.The documentary features excerpts from the diaries of various Civil War figures, high as well as humble, and commentary from various historians, including author-historian Shelby Foote, who does a good job of introducing in particular the Southern perspective (past and present).  The overall presentation is outstanding, and well worth watching and owning.  No Civil War afficianado will want to pass up the DVD collection of this piece.  It is quite simply a must-have.

It is simply everything you need to know about the American Civil War.  If you think history is dry and uninteresting, this film by Ken Burns will change your mind.  This is filled with comedy and pathos, courage and cowardice, and a balanced explanation that is fair to both sides of the conflict.Burns used well-known actors to read the diaries and writings of both famous people (Grant, Lee, Lincoln) and average persons and soldiers.  It gives one a well-rounded view of both sides.  I am in awe of the writings of that time--the people had an incredibly, descriptive way of writing; a command of the English language that has sadly been lost in modern times.Burns also used still photographs, panning across them, giving the audience the feel of watching an actual movie of the time.  That technique has since been adopted by other documentaries.I've seen the series many times, and each time find something more.  If nothing else, see it for Shelby Foot--a writer/historian who speaks about Robert E. Lee, and others, like he personally knew them.

Too often the filmmaker relies on writers, not historians, or historians with an axe to grind.Slavery is given as the main cause of the war.  This is true and not true.  Without slavery, the war would never have happened, yet it was not sufficient in and of itself.Other errors include the age of Lincoln when he died, that Grant was not the first person since Washington to be a Lt. General (Winfield Scott held the rank) and the number of boys under 17 to enlist in the Union Army, off by an order of magnitude.Watch it, but don't make it a sole resource.	4.0	The Best TV has done, BUT	2001-08-04	16	13	3

As someone from the West, who has no hang ups about being a Northerner (read leftist liberal whacko) or Southerner (read NASCAR-fueld, Dixie-humming, Confederate flag-waving whacko), and has done some post graduate work in 19th century America (yes, I'm telling you I'm smart and my opinion matters), I think it's a good documentary, and worth owning so you can watch it again and again.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A107O8UATN67M8	Samurai	"Whereas critics may have chirped at Ken Burns' other documentaries like 'Jazz' or 'New York', there is virtually universal praise for this single, spectacular masterpiece. Not only is the Civil War brought to life but by the end of the entire 11 hour series you feel like you've been through the war itself.The most important achievement of the documentary is showing how the war, with all its carnage, achieved the higher purpose of freeing the slaves. While the war may have started with the notion of keeping the tattered union together, it eventually brought societal, constitutional, economic, and medical changes that would have otherwise not come about had their not been a war. It truly was the birth of a ""new freedom"".You watch as new innovative tactics are introduced out of sheer necessity. You see thousands of men using outdated tactics (charging a defense line with your bayonet) are mowed down by new weapons such as the gattling gun and the Repeating Rifle. You witness the banality of siege warfare as implemented by Gen. George McClellan. And you contrast that with maneuver warfare brilliantly executed by Stonewall Jackson and Nathan Bedford Forrest. You learn how the generals (and the country at large) grew to appreciate and utilize the telegram. You learn from General Lee how to lead from the front and how a few men effectively positioned can hold off 100 men. You witness how incompetent Union generals nearly lost the war to an inferior army. With only a rudimentary understanding in medicine, tens of thousands died from disease and from reparable surface wounds. However, without the enormous loss of life, we would have never made the medical and tactical advances that the war brought on.More than any other character in the documentary, I enjoyed historian Shelby Foote the most. His amusing Mississippi drawl and the way he personalized the war made you realize the humanity of these legendary figures. He also highlighted how resentment towards blacks lasted for decades after the war (how the south still hates Lincoln, how Vicksburg refused to celebrate 4th of July for 80 years). You cannot possibly begin to understand US History until you have faithfully studied the Civil War. Thank you Ken Burns."	5.0	Should Be In Everyone's Collection	2002-10-17	41	38	3

Still, we both enjoy the documentary equally. It gives new and suprising (and startling) facts about the Civil War, but at the same time explains historic events in a way that even someone without a lot of background knowledge can understand.What I found most impressive were the letters written by ordinary soldiers to their wives, parents, and children (and read to the audience throughout the film). It puts the Civil War into a whole new perspective, beyond historic facts and figures and lets you understand that, ultimately, the ones least involved in the decision about starting this war were the ones most affected by it.	5.0	Outstanding documentary	2008-12-23	0	0	0

So, I've modified my favorite quote of Confucius somewhat, yet one has to understand the present and past ""to divine the future""; I think Confucius implies that. The American Civil War was a significant event of American history, no doubt about that. I watched a bootlegged VHS version of this recorded from the PBS series. What I like most about this film is the commentaries from different historians about the Civil War years. I particularly enjoyed Shelby Foote's and Barbara Fields' remarks. Shelby Foote's three volume set on the Civil War is a classic; he is a southerner who is also a veteran who served in WWII. Barbara Field is an African American historian. I felt that it was not biased and succeeded in showing faithfully what life was like during that era for people on all sides, and not just soldiers on the battlefields, by showing photographs of battle scenes and sites and soldiers, and by revealing the emotions of men and women who lived and died during that time through letters they wrote. On such an emotionally charged subject and divisive one at that, the series ends on a note of unity and understanding and caution. And I add we must understand this past, its real causes, to avoid repeating such tragedies in the future. Ken Burns and company did a beautiful job at illuminating an ugly and harrowing subject.One of the songs that plays wordlessly in the background at various times during this documentary is a tune that was recycled probably from an Irish tune from 1688 during the Glorious Revolution there. It was known during America's Revolution as Johnny's Gone for a Soldier, in the late 1600's and before 1776, it was also called Shule Agra and Buttermilk Hill. One must wonder at why the southerners suffered so many deprivations during the war to keep fighting like they did without shoes on their feet and little food, marching and marching for countless miles, 20-30 a day. I agree with others when they say that the subject of reconstruction is not dealt with in this film. It is an important subject too but is more than enough for a film of its own. After the war, southerners had their properties confiscated which engendered the term carpet bagger to denote the true motives of northern transplants to the south. Such were some of the liberators of American slaves. It was such a tragic war and as Ken Burns and others comment at the end, its consequences are still with us.All citizens of this country should watch this at least once.'Here I sit on Buttermilk Hill/Who can blame me, cryin' my fillAnd ev'ry tear would turn a mill/Johnny has gone for a soldier.Me, oh my, I loved him so/Broke my heart to see him go,And only time will heal my woe/Johnny has gone for a soldier.I'll sell my rod, I'll sell my reel/Likewise I'll sell my spinning wheel,And buy my love a sword of steel/Johnny has gone for a soldier.I'll dye my dress, I'll dye it red/And through the streets I'll beg for bread,For the lad that I love from me has fled/Johnny has gone for a soldier.'"	5.0	so tragic	2005-01-15	48	43	5
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AR1T36GLLAFFX	Scott FS	If Amazon invented the five-star rating system, it was for this film.  Ken Burns made a masterpiece with 'The Civil War.'From the photographs, the rare footage of the reunion of civil war veterans at the 75th anniversary of the battle at Gettysburg, the telling of the story of persons famous and not, using voices famous and not, the basic narration of David McCullough, the dividing of the episodes into coherent segments, this is a film NOT TO BE MISSED by anyone who has any interest at all in the world around them.I still run into people who have not seen this film.  Were they on Mars when it came out?  This remains PBS' most highly-rated program, and appropriately so.I've recently watched it again, and I can tell you that after the 10th viewing, it is as compelling as the first.  It is a landmark achievement, it is a winning effort, and it has a haunting and very effective soundtrack.  And the restoration available now makes the film even better.Burns' other documentaries are very good, especially 'Baseball'.  But he reached an insurmountable peak in 'The Civil War.'  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience to watch this film. If so some reason you have not viewed this stunning work, you really owe it to yourself and your family to purchase this DVD series and watch it with the spouse and kids.I am planning to lend my copy out to a friend (I don't know if she was on Mars or not in 1990).  I was concerned that I was building up the film so much that there was the risk that she'd be disappointed.  No chance.  I've seen it many times, remember how excellent it was, and yet I could hardly stop watching it again, recently, as the clock rolled around to two o'clock in the morning, with work just a few hours away.I consider myself blessed that I was alive to watch this.If ever there was an essential documentary, this is it.  It is the standard by which all other documentaries must be judged.Very, very highly recommended.  It is a must own.	5.0	The best documentary ever made, bar none	2009-12-21	2	2	0

The Civil War seems so long ago, but in doing my family genealogy, I realize that it wasn't. Many things have changed, yet some have not changed at all. These were real people, real lives, real emotions. We were devasted with the attacks on our country by terrorists from other countries on 9/11. Imagine how your ancestors felt about the attacks from within their country by their neighbors, friends and families divided by misbegotten notions.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	ASHBYEY81ZSE8	southernarc	I am very please with the Ken Burns DVD of The Civil War.  This is the documentary that first brought the War Between the States to life for me, and continues to do so today.  Now because of the DVD format, I can pause the screen at any time and have a perfect still picture to examine within my home!  The black and white pictures and moving color shots are definitely enhanced from the original VHS release.  While the audio is crisp and clear, I was a little disappointed with the 5.1 nature of the re-release.  Although at times the audio did come through the rear surround speakers, most of the action seems to take place in the front and center speakers.  A Hollywood action film it is not.If you have read earlier reviews about the &quot;shaky camera affect&quot; and are hesitant to buy this format over the VHS, do not let that stop you.  This criticism is silly, plain and simple.  On close ups of the stills, when the camera is either panning across or zooming in, there is bound to be some camera movement due to the high magnification.  But it is not excessive, nor distracting.  It even adds some &quot;life&quot; to the stills, which I believe would look less interesting if they were presented there just laying dead!  Again, don't worry, the DVD is not defective, it is the same as the original VHS format in terms of this.  It is not on the scale of the Blair Witch Project as some reviewers would lead you to believe.	5.0	Brings It To Life	2003-01-23	0	0	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	ANQCG0U5854L6	Sox2004	"Very entertaining, a masterpiece really. However, it perpetuates the myth that the abolition of slavery was at the heart of the war. So many facts run counter to this notion. For example, until well into the war, the North made it clear that it would welcome the South back into the Union with slavery intact. When Lincoln emancipated the slaves, he specifically did so only in the rebel states, leaving out the slave states that were loyal to the Union. This clearly indicates that this was a war tactic, pretty much the same one the British employed in the Revolutionary War. (If Britain had won that war, would they have justified it later on the basis of abolishing slavery?) Then, during Reconstruction, slavery was basically reimposed in the South in all but name, and the North did nothing about it. Why? Because the North had already achieved what it really wanted: reunification. I.e., slavery was no problem as long as the country stayed together, with Washington in firm control of all of the country's territory. If you think about it, what else could Lincoln have done when the South seceded? Letting those states go would have set a lousy precedent for all of the other states and probably would have fatally weakened the country (""give us what we want, or we'll secede like the South did""). In fact, Jefferson Davis himself faced this issue in the Confederacy: how do you keep a set of states together after endorsing the idea that any state has the right to secede basically whenever it wants? It's less romantic, but it makes much more sense to think of Union at the core of the war, not slavery."	4.0	Great but misleading	2006-12-04	26	20	6

This is the definition of a five star effort. It is exceptionally well filmed, exceptionally well narrated, and tremendously impactful.  Burn's masterful combination of images, music, and narration does more than simply inform, it moves you.  For my money, the letter of Sullivan Ballou to his wife on the eve of Bull Run read by David McCullough over the haunting melody of ""Ashokan Farewell"" is one of the finest moments in documentary film making.From the ones I've seen, Burns has never really come close to this in any of his subsequent projects in my opinion. But then again what other material can still pack as great a punch as the Civil War?  The people and events are larger than life and still resonate today.

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A3VQSFORKH8B7O	Steven Hancock	After years of hearing about this Ken Burns documentary, I finally sat and watched the eleven-hour documentary. To say the least, I was a bit dissapointed. Even though it was extremely stirring in many scenes, it was terribly one-sided. I hated the issue of slavery, and thank God that slavery was abolished, but it was not the main reason that this war was fought. I believe that if the south had won the war, that slavery would've been abolished within a decade because there was a chance that Lee, who also hated slavery, would've been elected president of the Confederacy. The line &quot;Robert E. Lee, who did not believe in slavery or secession, would end up defending both&quot; enraged me. He was not fighting for slavery OR the confederacy, but fought in defense of his home state of Virginia. If you like an emotional experience, then buy this film. But if you want to hear the story of the REAL Civil War, then check out the documentary &quot;Civil War Combat&quot; and the films &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; &quot;Glory,&quot; and the upcoming &quot;Gods and Generals.&quot; Grade: B-	3.0	GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT!	2002-09-29	30	13	17
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2AOZ5G2XR67V	"Straight No Chaser ""bluetooth"""	I saw this production when it was originally shown on PBS.  Sitting at home two weekends ago PBS broadcast a portion of it again and I was reminded of the greatness all over again.  Timeless is one word which comes to mind and it truly has all of the components of a great documentary,but the Civil War by Ken Burns was more than a documentary, it truly is as on reviewer stated - noble.  Of all of the things that this country is and ever will be, it is important to understand what we were, before we became a nation. As a collection of states where each state had the right to determine it's own agenda independent of the national needs, the Civil War redefined what a great nation would need to overcome to possess the responsibility of a union.Secondarily, but of supreme importance was the fact of the photographs used to tell the story.  As the first war ever to be photographed the story could be told and we could brought onto the battlefields, into the halls of congress, even into the slave quarters and cotten fields; and finally into the theater box of the assination of the President; the Civil War allows us to live the those moments again.  Again, there are some things which should be required viewing before everyone reaches a certain age (Dr. Strangelove,Blazing Saddles, The Godfather), the Civil War is an important epic of American History, and could be one of the things to be required to view.	5.0	The best thing you will ever see on television	2010-10-17	1	1	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2KVUYPLEW4LXT	"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time"""	I remember studying the American Civil War when I was a kid in school. But stangely, I don't remember really learning anything. Sure, I learned who the Presidents were and who the Generals were, and the names of a battle or two, but I really really FELT it. I never knew the real story. Then, a few years back some of my friends told me about people who lived during the time period (Grant for instance). About the same time, I was told about this documentary by another acquaintance. He went on and on about how great it was. The more I heard about it from various sources the more I wanted to see it. Then, I finally found a copy at the library and watched the whole thing.Wow. I've seen documentaries aplenty over the years, but never ANYTHING like this. This documentary is an absolute tour-de-force of the American Civil War. From the first shots fired to the end and aftermath, everything is covered. Every issue, every confrontation, every bullet and riot seems to come alive. What makes this really unbelievable is the fact that most of the film is told through pictures with voice-overs. How you can feel like you are watching an epic movie when you are really just seeing still pictures really boggles my mind, but it is true.In this documentary you will learn about the people, locations, social forces, culture and beliefs of an entire nation. You will hear about incredible good and bad luck, death and destruction, loyalty and devotion, and sheer madness. I remember a time during my trip through this huge masterpiece when I asked myself &quot;When are Grant and Lee going to meet? They do fight each other in the war don't they?&quot; In reply the documentary ended a section on the mother of all cliff-hangers. A line representing Lee's Army and a Line representing Grant's Army drew closer and closer, and the narrator said that the two unstoppable forces were about to meet in battle for the first time. The tension was incredible. Then I saw the words on the screen that told me the confrontation would be on the next volume...This is not just a great documentary, it is a great work of art and a masterpiece of direction. I learned more from this documentary than I ever learned from school, and it was endlessly more entertaining. I feel that I have grown as an individual from watching this film.

Whether the United States would remain a loose and voluntary union of sovereign states or a centralized modern state was the ultimate question of the war.  Burns' narrative by way of personal anecdotes and period letters makes for an emotionally gripping tale that pulls the viewer in to the story.  With it, the viewer begins to realize just how much of the modern political debate have roots in that conflict a mere century and a half in our past.

He uses still photos, but moves the camera over the photos to give the illusion of movement.  Combining this with film of reenactments and the voices of writers and actors, he helps us understand what the Civil War was all about.Shelby Foote is featured in the series, and he's worth the cost of the set.  His trilogy of Civil War books might be the best history of the war ever written, and to hear him tell the stories was a real treat.Burns uses the music popular at the time; the voices of actors, quoting the participants in the war; sound effects; still photos and sketches; stories told by historians and some reenactment film to tell the story of this bloody war.  He includes some amazing statistics, letters and exerpts from diaries written at the time and other quotes to tell the story.	5.0	Outstanding Civil War Miniseries	2003-10-29	2	2	0

Has anyone else noticed this?Examples:1. Deleted? The scene where Lee's nicknames of Granny Lee, the King of Spades, and Marse Robert are mentioned. Did I just miss it?2. Added? The scene that talks about John Mosby and all of the dispatchs that Lee wrote that mentioned him.3. Added? The Mosby scene was followed by a scene about popular hymns and songs and showed photos of related sheet music.I don't mind the added scenes, but I hope they didn't omit any.I've also think there are some problems with the transfer, but maybe they couldn't be cleaned up during the ""reconstruction"" of the film.Any information or opinions appreciated!

Watching this should inspire you to tackle Shelby Foote's three volume series. Watching this should inspire you to visit (and preserve) battlefield sites. You must see Gettysburg and Shiloh at the very least. You have to walk the ground. It is a sad commentary that so few Americans appreciate our history.

Ken Burns documentary presents us with a staggering picture of the good, the bad and the ugly during the greatest conflict our country has ever endured.  I just purchased four copies from Amazon for my adult children for Christmas since my husband and I have so thoroughly enjoyed every episode.  Unlike some documentaries, Ken Burns' Civil War is riveting and informative without being bogged down in the minutia that can put you to sleep no matter how interesting the topic.  The narration by David McCullough is the key element that holds it all together with an extraordinary voice that pulls you in. Interviews with people who have spent their lives studying this great conflict offer insightful and thoughtful opinions and observations which lead to a greater humanization of the story. The interviews with  Shelby Foote were especially notable and enjoyable.  And possibly the most riveting part of this series are the many photographs taken primarily by Mathew Brady, noted photographer of the day.  They are poignant and haunting and bring images you won't soon forget. Also the thoughtfully chosen music throughout (especially the beautiful Ashokan Farewell) makes the experience all the richer. For anyone who wants a clear understanding of the devastating effects caused by the Civil War as well as Lincoln's brilliant leadership that brought a healing nation together under the most compelling of circumstances, I cannot recommend it strongly enough.	5.0	A Must View...

It took up 3 Video tapes and I watched them over and over for 20+ years. Needless to say they are thoroughly wore out and I no longer have a VCR to play them on anyway. This DVD set with all the extras(extended interviews with Shelby Foote and Ken Burns and so much more) brought back all the visual beauty with superior surround sound which makes you feel like you are right in the middle of the battle. Is it perfect... no, the only downfall is it didn't hit the western campaign with great detail but, it brought not only the historical aspect to life, Ken did a superior job of bring the human aspect of the major players plus the human aspect of the struggle of the slaves to life as well. this project took Ken 5 years of intense work to bring this to the small screen, I consider that a monumental task!

Only thing I disagree with is that slavery was not the main cause of the civil war. There were other factors involved as well. Ken Burns set the standard that would be used in all of his future documentaries by using pictures and expert interviews. One contributor was historian Shelby Foote who gave expert information sourounding the civil war. This documentary does an excellent job in describing a very traumatic part of our American history.

I remember seeing it on TV when it first appeared on PBS in 1990 or so. However, the new updated version is even better due to the improved sounds and visuals. Now we can enjoy it at our leisure due to the new DVD set.I highly recommend this DVD set for any history buff. It's unique format of celebrities narrating the quotes of our ancestors from the Civil War era is a delight.	5.0	Ken Burns' Civil War Documentary is an American Classic	2010-02-06	0	0	0

Fields ""cinemagic"""	"Before the Civil War, people said ""the United States are"", whereas afterward they began saying ""the United States is"".  This alone shows how much the war defined what our country really is.  No longer a federation of states, it is now one nation indivisible.  The Civil War was also the first truly modern war, with widespread use of the telegraph, the railroad, aerial observation, the machine gun, trench warfare, ironclad warships, and organized battlefield medicine.  It was the first war to be extensively photographed.Ken Burns brings out the details of the great struggle. Without any clear bias, he retells the story from both sides.  He makes it real and vivid, not like a classroom lecture.  This is one of the best historical documentaries ever, comparable to Victory at Sea or The World at War."	5.0	The War That Defined America	2010-02-01	1	1	0
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A1GZKHEQWTS4Z5	Thomas Moody	Simply a masterpiece...when viewing these types of historical documentaries, one of my major viewing points is: how is the history told/portrayed? and do we get context with the narrative? Ken Burns has certainly succeeded on both counts and he's also set the standard for documentary with this monumental effort on the Civil War. Political, Social and Historical perspectives abound in this boxed set with no equal anywhere in the documentary world, I'd wager. The political climate that started the war gets it's very own tape and is wonderfully told in context with the social atmosphere of the time. The war and all the major battles are overlayed with readings from historical documents/diaries of the time as well as &quot;then and now&quot; pictures and films that set the viewer squarely into those momentous times (the battles at Antietam, Gettysburg, Shiloh and the Wilderness are wonderful examples of the &quot;then and now&quot; pictures/films...). One of the major selling points of this work is that Burns has managed to keep the flow of the War uppermost in the viewers mind (amazingly through all nine tapes) while still able to digress into the aforementioned social and political issues of the time (slavery, the everyday man and woman's perspective, Abraham Lincoln's administration ...etc.). Finally, with historical discussions with Shelby Foote and narration by David McCullough, Burns has set the bar unattainably high for other documentaries...it simply doesn't get any better than this. It takes a while to view all these episodes, but if you're even remotely interested in the Civil War or history of the mid-1800's, I promise that you won't be disappointed. Highest recommendation.	5.0	Video history at it's finest...	2002-02-26	3	2	1

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A35KD1U1M387I0	Todd E. Newman	The CLASSIC! Looking back, Ken Burns' work from the late 80's that brought this production together was monumental for the time and probably will be most remembered as his best work.  What makes this DVD set different from the huge VHS pack released 10 years ago is that it now has interviews with key historians like Shelby Foote that talk about the making of the production and their thoughts then and now.  This work is monumental and probably won't seriously be tackled for a long time by another director and we're lucky to have Ken Burns handle this huge task of reporting the entire Civil War.  This DVD set is put together very well and is probably the most well rounded documentary ever assembled on the subject.  It has nearly 11 hours of material and is definately worth the money. Like all of Burns' work, everything is always done very well and high-class.  I highly recommend this set!!	5.0	Probably the best Civil War documentary ever produced!	2002-09-19	16	16	0

Burns starts with the correct historical stand that the war DID NOT start because of slavery, but because of the succession of the states. Slavery became a factor quickly later. This USED to be what history taught in government schools, but now, it is merely an issue of slavery totally. Burns does a great job with film, facts, and the music. The songs are very authentic and the piece Ashokan Farewell (written in the early 1980s) fits perfectly as sort of the theme song for the series. It is hard to watch one segment and not go to the next. The segments are very well placed so that long pauses can be taken without losing out on the story line. I particularly liked the old films of the last living civil war vets and the poetry by a granddaughter (I think) of a former slave. As with most of Burns' productions, you cannot go wrong with this set.	5.0	One of Greatest Expose's on the Civil War	2009-01-30	0	0	0

I challenge anyone to remain impervious to its charms.  In addition to offering a wealth of historical information, the series removes from abstraction the intimately human aspects of this remarkable event and illuminates them in a way that makes it possible for us to truly resonate.  Multiple strands are skillfully interwoven while music and images from the era generate tremendous atmosphere, making the experience of viewing more like sitting on grandpa's lap while he shares this rich and compelling tale.	5.0	Some Things Are Special Because They Were Made That Way.	2002-07-03	7	6	1
6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A333J214SI1VFZ	"Tony Hughes ""stellarossa"""	I'm not entirely sure if even Ken Burns knew exactly how successful a series he had made when he produced this. It took longer to make this series than it did for the Civil War to come and go - and it shows. Burns and the enormous amount of people who worked on this series certainly did their research.The story starts in the 1850's, explaining the slavery versus free states issues and concentrating on 'bleeding' Kansas. The catalysts of war are explored, everything from growing disparity between north and south to the redoutable John Brown.Burns then takes us from battle to battle, skirmish to skirmish, switching sides then switching back again. Expert analysis is provided by a number of 'talking head' historians, the best of which is Shelby Foote, who seems to have a genius for making the most ordinary story sound interesting and occasionally comical.And so it goes on. We follow Union and Confederate privates, listen to diary entries from concerned civilians and listen to battle plans being discussed by Generals of both sides. Pertinent facts are fed to the viewers by the deadpan narration. A nice touch is that, although we move from State to State throughout the 4 year war, Burns keeps us in touch with an ordinary soldier from each side, and we therefore have their view of the war from the start right to the very end.The DVD is packed with extras, including a very interesting documentary on making the documentary. A great starting point for anyone interested in this conflict, or understanding this country.	5.0	Don't  Look Away!	2003-09-03	1	1	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A2MDF75WMX607L	"Trajanus ""Varus"""	"To a truth, it is a memorable piece. It would be hard to give service to all in a scant 10hrs of television. With that in mind I think it is important to remember that while it may seem ""in depth"", that this is a history that spans decades before the war and in it's nuances encompasses a vast subject matter that 10hrs of narratives and images just scratches the surface.To those that have plowed through just one of the tomes available to us from eye witnesses published after the war, it will seem as if Burns ""doesn't get it"". To credit Burns where credit is due, he does succeed painting a landscape in attempt to let us further the understanding what seems may seem to be inconceivable. That being the prime question, ""Why would Americans (US citizens) butcher one another for 4 years?"" Burns also makes effort to help in conveying the scale of that carnage.Using the perspectives and notions of a 21st century mind are dangerous when analyzing history. It does seem that the 21st century mind finds it easier to imagine why someone would go to war over slavery than to preserve states rights or to preserve the Union. It's imperative to keep in mind that our reasons are NOT their reasons.  Mark Twain might have launched a triad about the simple characterizing of the causes of the war. I think we can safely say that these are over simplified. Yet, in some ways the simplistic view of the cause does have a ring of truth in it.It's also hard not to mention the one sided nature given to both sides. I'm glad Shelby Foote was included to tell stories and I do think that Foote is capable giving credence to those that deserve it. However, the romancing of any figure of the Civil War will lend itself to liable, let alone the likes of Nathan B. Forrest. In hearing the grievances on both sides of the ""blue and grey"" line, I think he's done it in nearly equal amounts.An exception to this is the apparent ""Virginia Blinders"" in leaving out almost entirely the early western campaigns of 61-62.In closing I won't hold back my praise the informative piece this can be to spark more then just a casual interest in the Civil War. And for those who have had more then a novice course in the history. The wonderful color and emotion is welcome when you look past the omissions that, while unfortunate, are common short comings."	5.0	Here-to-and-fore a memorialable piece	2005-06-22	4	2	2

Indeed, it may well have single-handedly paved the way for the creation of an entire network, The History Channel.But for me, the best praise I can give this thing is to say that before I saw this film, no period of history was as boring to me as the American Civil War.

Don't; you'd be missing one of the great video-viewing experiences around. Where else could  you learn, for example, that General Ulysses S. Grant showed &quot;no more  emotion than last year's bird nest&quot; after he read Robert E. Lee's  letter of surrender? Or that Union troops marching through Georgia ripped  off and bowed so many railroad tracks along the way that Confederates began  calling the familiar sight of twisted metal &quot;Sherman's neckties&quot;  after the general that led the march? Set to nostalgic period music and  refreshed with sideline comments from historical experts, the series is a  visual treat meant to be viewed again and again. It's not only a valuable  and accessible source of historical information, but a truly entertaining  drama that never failes to inspire new insights with each viewing. The test  of any work is its ability to present solid information in a beguiling and  memorable way, and &quot;The Civil War&quot; excels even at its own high  standards. Its open-ended construction is meant to be seen in the  open-ended way that history is lived, so that it's logical for a few hours  to suspend the historical knowledge of the war's outcome that's known to  every school child. Thus, as the film unfolds, it seems realistic to think  the &quot;rebs&quot; could rally and defeat the northern blues after all,  or that Lincoln might stay home that April evening instead of going to see  a play at Ford's Theater. All in all, it's an experience not to be missed.	5.0	View the Civil War the way contemporaries lived it!	2000-06-08	3	3	0

I won't go into detail about it as many other reviewers have already done so.I did want to mention something that I noticed after I bought the set and watched it through twice. On Disc 1: The Cause, the narrator says:""By 1860, the last year of peace, one out of every seven Americans belonged to another American. Four million men, women and children were slaves.""Immediately following this, a quote by Abraham Lincoln is read:""Whence shall we expect the approach of danger? Shall some transatlantic giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never. All the armies of Europe and Asia could not by force take a drink from  the Ohio river or make a track on the Blue Ridge in the trial of a thousand years. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men, we will live forever or die by suicide.""-Abraham Lincoln, 1837The documentary presents these two quotes in such a way as to give the impression that Lincoln's quote was about slavery. It was not. The speech which includes these words was a speech entitled, ""Opposition to Mob-Rule,"" given as an address before The Young Men's Lyceum in Springfield, Illinois on January 27, 1837.I'm a stickler about such things. The quote was taken out of context and I don't appreciate that. Due to this, I now feel that I cannot reasonably rely on what is said in the documentary. I will have to pay closer attention and look up what is told in the books that I have, along with Lincoln's writings and speeches, which are free on the Internet. They are also free in Kindle form here on Amazon, which is where I got my copies."	4.0	Breakthrough documentary	2012-05-28	4	2	2

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AV0E7GJP6BPDY	"VirtualNeighbor ""~miked"""	Five stars - does a good job of painting the social and political times, and discusses some key battles and overall strategies.  Civil War expert historians discuss things at some length.  The main narrator is fantastic.  Good use of quotes from people who wrote at the time.  The photography is amazing, as you would expect of a Ken Burns film, and this helps bring the Civil War to life in a way no other series or show ever has.  Fantastic background of some of the generals and their interactions (Lee, Grant, Sherman especially, and many others, too).I'd recommend this series to people wanting to immerse themselves in the period and get some deeper insight into the feelings and thoughts of the people who fought/experienced the war.  It was a little weak in some battle details (though in depth military strategy of how the battles were fought was not its focus so this isn't a fault, just something I would have liked).  I think it might be a little weak on the topics of: how much slaves did to shape the outcome, how much railroad and telegraph shaped the outcome.  Still, five stars!	5.0	Fantastic rounded view of the period	2014-01-08	0	0	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A18M68DE1Y6W51	Wendy Kaplan	Watching this masterpiece in its brilliant entirety is like being on the battlefields with the soldiers, North and South. Like being at home with their left-behind loved ones. Like being the parent of a teenaged young man eager to join the carnage in the naive thought that it will be a lark.Through Ken Burns' soothing and easy-to-listen-to narrative, illustrated liberally with photographs, drawings, maps, biographies, and letters read in voiceover, the viewer is completely drawn into another time, another era. And yet--looking at the pictures of the (mostly doomed) soldiers, hearing their letters home, knowing of their suffering and their heroism, one realizes that life has not changed all that much. These boys are our boys. The struggling leaders, from generals with drinking problems on up to Abraham Lincoln in all his glory, are just people, caught up in a conflict so historic, it still lives on.How much better to teach children about the Civil War through this series of tapes than through a dull, boring textbook that lists dry dates and lists of names. Part of our heritage, this conflict should be learned and understood by everybody. And there is nobody more skilled at teaching it than Ken Burns. Bravo, Mr. Burns. I applaud you.	5.0	History Comes Alive	2002-11-29	6	6	0

The war was really fought over North, South trade practices, controlled by northern industrialists. Import, export taxes and duties were starving the South. Slavery was already in its death throws before the war started. The real cost to the country was the wasting of patriotic American men over money and the attempt to destroy States Rights.

There were so many moments of grandeur and tragedy interwoven into the show--it was remarkable to watch.The show's ability to create dramatic tension with only old photographs of Civil War battle sites and the people of the time, coupled with voice-overs was astounding to me--there was not one dramatic re-enactment in the entire series.Since the show was an extended miniseries (11 hours long) that meant that it could be leisurely yet thorough, and explore people and events from multiple points of view.Probably the most appealing single person in the series, for me, was Shelby Foote, a Southern historian who, throughout the series, provided an appreciative accounting of the Southerners who fought on the Confederate side, while making it clear that he had no appreciation for the practice of slavery.Along with the remarkable eloquence of the people who wrote the letters during that War, I appreciated the care that was taken by Ken Burns to find celebrities, like Jason Robards and Julie Harris, to read those letters aloud. They had such wonderfully evocative voices, and along with the mellow voices from historians like David McCullough and Shelby Foote, providing information and perspective, they made the experience of watching The Civil War magical.	5.0	One of the finest documentaries ever	2007-04-25	39	39	0

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	A38QEATH3NODFM	Wiseguy 945	"I watched this series when it first came out in 1990 on PBS, and was mezmerized by it, also studing U.S history at that time and having read a rather large Civil War book for a class project as well.  Now on weekends our PBS station has been reruning some episodes, and it sparked me to look it up here on amazon to see what prices were, which have come down tremendously, so I bought a set.  Now reflecting back 16 years later, this show is good for base history, but it also has the narration, music and organizations of a Drama.  I enjoyed the battle history and seeing the maps as the battles played out, but the narration got tiresome around tape 5.  And I know Shelby Foote is a smart man, and knows a lot about the civil war, but I just got so sick of his ""quotes"" of generals etc, no historical value in any of the quotes, and they got tiresome really quick for me.  But,Overall, you can't beat this collection for civil war history, and the price is now very reasonable on VHS. 4 stars from this reviewer overall, but 5 stars as a production, and unmatched to this date by any other series on PBS, or TV in general."	4.0	A great collection, drama and great narration, and some good history as well.	2006-10-28	6	5	1

6301996135	The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"Ken Burns' epic documentary about the Civil War is perhaps the greatest and most all-encompassing history lesson of the North/South conflict that has ever been put on film or page. Not only is every important detail of the war covered (and in such a way that the details are interesting and important, not boring), but two entire episodes are devoted to the build-up and aftermath of the conflict. Essentially, if you were teaching a class on the Civil War, this video is all you would need, as it both conveys the vital information of the war, and does so in a way that doesn't stagnate. In essence, a very tight, well-produced series.The only reason I give this set four stars out of five, though, is that it lacks (althouht through no fault of its own) the emotional punch of Burns' more recent ""The War"" (World War II) series. Such things as personal interviews and live video could obviously not be obtained from the 1860s, but the reading of letters and still photographs doesn't quite measure up. The best example I can give of this is that while watching the Civil War series I found myself treating it as one extended history class session, while ""The War"" was almost more of a dramatic event (what with the live interviews and video footage).So, although the Civil War documentary by Ken Burns is a brilliant work of research and cinematography, I can only give it a four-star rating due to its lacks of live video footage or emotionally moving personal interviews. I do, however, strongly recommend this series to anyone wanting to learn a bit more about the most brutal war in United States history. You may not need the tissue box while watching this series (unlike ""The War""), but I guarantee you will come away with a much more solid understanding of the events that caused, prolonged, and ended the American Civil War."	4.0	"A Great History Lessons, But Lacks The Emotional Punch Of ""The War"""	2008-11-02	0	0	0

It definitely has a somber tone, and really makes the war seem more real than ever before.

The use of sound effects with old photos makes the pictures come alive and the color videos of the battlegrounds are impressive.

His dry humor and knowledge of the war make his observations always interesting. Don't miss his comments on the bonus disk.I recommend the PBS DVD ""Slavery by Another Name"" released in 2012 as a followup to this set.
