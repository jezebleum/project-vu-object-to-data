0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2QB4F1510HPL8	13 Ways And Counting	"We've all seen this one, know the lines, and you likely have this on VHS and DVD.That being said; a really good Blu-ray transfer. Shelly Long and that hideaous gaping maw of a mouth has NEVER looked so repulsive. Her giant piano key teeth really pop out during the beginning of this movie. It was the first thing my fiance and I noticed.Jack Nicholson looks just that much crazier in hi-def. If you like the original film/DVD/VHS this is worthy of your Blu-ray collection.On a side note - the TV mini-series movie thing is also on DVD. In my opinion it is far superior to Kubrick's rendition of the shining any day. You'll know exactly what I mean if you've read the book. Get this one on Blu-ray and also purchase:""Stephen King's The Shining (Two Disc Special Edition) (1997)""Use the above text in a search on Amazon, it's only $7.50 - you won't be dissapointed!"	4.0	Blu-ray Review - Worthy of purchase	2009-01-06	2	1	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"(4 1/2 *'s) After all these years, I hedged at the prospect of watching `The Shining`.  Having seen the snippets of Jack Nicholson's skillful performance, I partly dismissed the movie.  In my mind, thinking of his famous line, ""Here's Johnny!"" the film seemed a novelty, something entertaining in a way it wasn't intended.  Between Stanley Kubrick's amazing direction and Nicholson's and Shelly Duvall's excellent performances, first impressions can be misleading.  Watching `The Shining' is a real treat.Most people are familiar with either the film or the Stephen King book or both, so I'll be brief about the plot:  Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a former Vermont school teacher, transitioning as a novelist.  He interviews as a hotel keeper during the off season in Colorado's high country with the prospect of bringing his family to the empty domain.  During the interview, his new employer delicately lets him know about a tragedy at the hotel several years ago:  A former caretaker became unhinged by cabin fever and had slain his entire family with an axe.  Unfazed by the history, Jack signs on the dotted.  At home his son Danny has rough times.  A visionary of sorts, his other personality picks up on future ominous events, making the boy dread their new venture.  At the hotel, they meet the head chef, Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who picks up on little Danny's perception with an ESP type awareness.Both the story and Kubrick's masterful direction make 'The Shining' a horror classic.  From the start we get vertiginous mountain views and all of the visions seep into our unconscious core, making the deep winter mountain adventure chilling indeed.  Seldom have I seen such an effect of going around the bend.  Whether from the point of view of boy on a Big Wheel  or in an outdoor labyrinthine evergreen maze, the suspense of danger around every corner is palpable.  Foreshadowing is amply present, constantly building up every scene to each chosen climax.While nearly a flawless horror movie, there are a few objections.  Jack makes some connections to the horrible past in ways that are meant to be authentic, but break some of the mood of the movie.  While the time frames are well connected between present and past, the execution leaves something to be desired as Jack finds a key player in the past.Despite this minor objection, `The Shining' is a thriller.  The aftermath of my latent viewing is awe for Nicholson's creepy performance as the slowly transforming Jack, and Duvall's portrayal of growing terror is unnerving and frames Nicholson's performance perfectly.  Like Linda Blair before him, Danny Lloyd is perfectly believable as the little boy.  Happy Halloween! -JP |:>["	4.0	Just Around the Corner	2007-10-31	2	0	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A22AD8M2SSOFHJ	"A. C. Ege/Acedoh ""acedoh"""	This classic remains a sensational, psychological thriller over 25 years later.  The story remains the same but now it comes in fantastic high definition.  Stanley Kubrick's vision was different from how Stephen King originally wrote it.  Although it's Kubricks vision that makes this movie so enjoyable.Set in beautiful Colorado the story is dark in a bright environment.  Jack Nicholson plays an average father named Jack.  Jack has been unemployed for a few months and is trying to be a writer.  To further his writing he takes the opportunity to move his family to a desolate resort in the Rockies.  The resort closes during the Winter and hires Jack to be a caretaker during that period.Jack's son Danny has begun to exhibit abnormal behavior by making an imaginary friend out of his finger.  This friend tells Danny things that seem to exhibit a special ability.  Jack's wife Wendy just seems to want everything to go right in their lives.  Unfortunately the move to the resort is the worst thing that can happen.Most of the acting is excellent in this movie and the scenes are still scary at times.  Even though movies have become more action packed and fast paced The Shining still shines.  That is why movies like this get even better with time.The Blu-ray version is okay.  The remaster is not the best I have seen for an older movie.  The picture is more defined but still not what I would like to see.  I am not going to mark down the score since this movie is too good for that.  The picture is better and the price is right.  For people who want to add a wonderful classic to their Blu-ray collection, The Shining is quite the movie to have.  For the price it can't be beat.	5.0	Still Sensational	2007-12-29	7	4	3
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AO3JW5VHT2GQ	A Customer	Summary:Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a writer looking for some time to get away from the hectic humdrum of modern life so he can focus on writing.  Hearing that a a Colorado resort, The Overlook Motel, closes for the winter because of extremely deep snow but needs a maintenance person to stay there during the winter months to prevent major damage, he signs up, bringing along his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and his son, Danny (Danny Lloyd)...My Comments:I remember seeing this on TV (edited obviously) when I was younger, but I didn't remember much of it by the time I watched it again, just a few shots of Jack Nicholson's crazed face.  I can only guess that I tried to forget it as a child so I could sleep.  This must be a very disturbing movie for children seeing as how Danny's father, one of the people he is supposed to be able to trust, is trying to kill him.Of course, I'm no longer a child and my opinions have changed.  Watching this as an adult I found the movie to be absolutely entrancing.  There are some problems, of course, but nothing particularly major.  First, as the movie worked its way into the depths of Jack's mania my wife and I were discussing what we believed would happen (I really couldn't remember the plot, so this was a fair discussion).  It wasn't that hard to guess based upon the setup - ...  But despite knowing pretty much what was going to happen, there were still a number of unpredictable surprises.  I found the delusional conversations with people out of the past of the motel to be particularly engaging.The other problem I had with the movie was Shelley Duvall.  Is she not the biggest whiner and wimp you have ever seen?  I think it really came out in the 'making of' featurette that she is all about getting attention; she's like a spoiled child.  Perhaps this worked perfectly for her role, her constant crying and giving in to Jack, but just the story itself and the performance by Jack Nicholson were probably enough to guarantee that whoever played his counterpart would be good.  Not that I can really question Kubrick's decision, it did, after all, work very well, but Duvall is still whiney and annoying.One final comment about the special featurette on the DVD... Though the behind the scenes shots included in the featurette were very interesting and gave a nice additional perspective to what was going on, Vivian Kubrick is not Stanley.  Apparently she hasn't tried to hard to follow in her father's footsteps, thank goodness.  I don't know how you could really spoil the 'making of' featurette of this movie because pretty much everything about the movie is fascinating, but the way she arranges the clips and includes some bizarre shots is more distracting than entertaining and educational.  There isn't really much of a need to be overly artistic with a 'making of' video.Overall, I don't think I would recommend this movie for children.  However, after having seen it I think I'd like to visit the 'real' Overlook Motel (the outside shots were of Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood in Oregon) to get a pictures; I drove through Fargo, ND for the same reason.  It's a great movie with a classic performance by Jack Nicholas.  If you want to be entertained by a classy thriller, see The Shining.	4.0	Amazing!  No wonder it scared me as a child	2003-07-01	0	0	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1VWWTCCFU8EVQ	A Customer	This is more about my experience than an actual review. OK here we go....I read the Stephen King novel twice before I finally got to see this movie at a late night showing in Southend, Essex(UK)in the 80's. Stephen King had a problem with Stanley Kubricks interpretation, other websites go into this in more detail but to be fair if you want the actual version of the book, Stephen King remade it in 1997 as a TV mini series, and that version is pretty good. It has a couple of moments in Stephen King's film version of 'The Shining' which I wish was in Mr Kubrick's version. 'The Shining' has influenced me throughout my life. I remember in the 80's when I used to say it was my favourite film of all time, people would look down their noses in disapproval or laugh. Nowadays when I say `The Shining' is one of my all time favourites people agree...My instinct was correct all those years ago.For me there is nothing more scary than having Jack Nicholson chasing you down long corridors with an axe in a hotel isolated in the middle of bloody nowhere. Period. (OK, I lied, if you have played games `Dead Space' and 'Dead Space 2' on Xbox 360  that's not scary, it's bloody terrifying!). I took my film club buddies to a special screening of `The Shining' at the REX Cinema in Berkhamsted, a beautiful red and gold art deco cinema, unmatched by any other venue here in the UK. This cinema will blow you away: [...]The atmosphere of The Rex was perfect to see `The Shining'. The icing on the cake, which was unexpected, was that Kubrick's daughter introduced the film. `Wow, it doesn't get better than this' I said at the time. It was a dream come true to see this film for the second time on the big screen. My good friend Wayne had never seen it before, he said afterwards...'I dunno what to say, I can't say I liked it because it was an experience. It blew me away. I'm speechless'. Wayne's totally right, the film is an experience and one that I've cherished.I remember when I was at drama school we had to be a famous person for a day and I chose to be Jack Nicholson. When I arrived at the school in character, in my old black city mini, I had the third year students check the school over for bombs and security because I asked them to be my body guards. My explanation for driving a small car was due to the fact my limo had broken down. I (Jack) was visiting the school to talk about `The Shining 2'. I never forget Damon Albarn (who was in my class at drama school) decided to be the Ayatollah Khomeini and said he wished he thought of having body guards like I had. I also learned Jacks lines from `The Shining' and continued to use them throughout that drama school day. Great memories!The film had an ongoing impact with me, 'Jack Torrence' would be the part I was born to play, but damn, Stanley made it when I was too young to play a recovering alcoholic father. Years ago when we went to Canada and crossed over to Maine, I enquired about the location of the `Overlook Hotel'. At the time I didn't know the inside scenes were film sets. And I was way off target to travel to the actual Timberline lodge which is an hours drive from Portland. The lodge is featured in the film as the outside of the `Overlook Hotel'. So eventually a video shop owner in Maine (with a shelved wall dedicated to only Stephen King videos) told me where the man himself, Stephen King, lived... I was going to press the button on the open security gate to Stephen's home, but my bottle went, I chickened out. The home was huge, red with iron fencing with three serpent headed iron bats resting on the gate entrances.My friend Guy has an actual framed print from the film which is very cool, I have a Blu - ray copy I bought overseas which is the full version. A long time ago I had the idea for a film `Shining 2'. The story; a group goes on a trip to see where `The Shining' locations and influences are ....and one of the group actually has some kind of breakdown similar to the Jack Torrence character. I remember seeing a similar idea in the sequel to 'The Blair Witch Project'. I missed the boat on that one, I had a good idea and someone else not only thought of it as well, they had the means to implement it.Nicholson is spectacular in the role of Jack Torrence, Shelley Duvall is an absolute wreck as the story develops. The making of `The Shining' by Kubrick's daughter is enlightening, especially about Kubrick's demands on Shelley. The film is way ahead of its time, especially with the Steadicam work that enables the camera operator to run smooth following the actors, most notably the child on the cycle Go Kart rolling over wood and carpet, in turn creating the distinct changing floor thud sounds. Awesome stuff. I also remember seeing the soundtrack available on record once in London, I didn't buy it and boy do I regret it now because it's unavailable. So many film makers have been influenced by this film and deservedly so. Kubrick's obsession with attention to detail is crazy or genius; everyone has their own take on this. I think it's a bit of both. However, it is the end result that matters.I wonder what people in their twenties and thirties feel about the film. Maybe it's not on their radar or they have their own personal film that's made a mark. Who knows. It's inevitable one day `The Shining' will be remade. You could research so much about this film online, it really is that interesting. I remember reading that Simon Cowell almost worked on it but decided not to. I hope this film holds it's value in the future, it's so unique.I'll leave you with this thought; Can you imagine an amusement thrill ride park that has a huge special set built exactly like the Overlook Hotel and real snow covering an external large hedge maze and when you visit this experience....a Jack Nicholson lookalike (one that can act of course) comes after you. Some people would pay alot of money for that thrill. And so would I.Terrific.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com	5.0	bleedingfilms.com review of 'The Shining'	2012-03-31	10	2	8

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1OUCSOFWJ5RNN	"A. Galarza ""AG"""	"The real horror of The Shining lies in the film's hidden messages.  Knowing that Stanley Kubrick used film genres (e.g., terror) as a means to an end-to show audiences larger social, cultural, and even cosmic truths (e.g., 2001: A Space Odyssey)-one can see that this is more than a regular ""horror flick.""  This is what separates this director from most, who simply direct movies for their entertainment value.In The Shining, Kubrick shows us a horror larger than that of a writer (Jack Nicholson) who, one winter, disintegrates mentally and tries to kill his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) with an ax at a deserted resort hotel in Colorado.  Sure, this is part of the terror, and the fact that Jack actually murders Dick, the hotel chef (Scatman Crothers), at the end after the clairvoyant cook follows his instinct regarding the need for him to travel from Florida to Colorado to check up on the family.But dehumanization, the flick's leitmotif, involves much more than that, and the other horrors that occur throughout the film are what contribute to the mayhem at the end.  The truly terrifying aspect of this film is that these horrors affect us all day-to-day-at least, those who live in contemporary America.  These horrors are too numerous to describe here.  But the most serious involve separate, disparate elements of modern living, and yet, elements that are strangely interrelated.  First, the genocide of Native Americans surfaces repeatedly in the film (e.g., Indian rugs everywhere, Indian pipettes on kitchen cans, Wendy's braids, Indian background music, a rushing river of blood gushing from elevator doors, etc.).  The luxurious hotel is also called the Overlook, a literal name for a lavish America built on an Indian burial ground, which continues to ""overlook"" the fact that the United States was built at the expense of Native American blood-not to mention that of blacks.  Second, the film's large, empty hotel both symbolizes and reifies the same isolation of the typical, suburban, middle-class American family-the nuclear family literally light years apart from neighbors and community (e.g., most neighbors don't even know one another's names).  Furthermore, this real-life isolation is not just inside suburban homes-empty as the Overlook's interior-but outside on neighborhood streets and sidewalks, except for a car or two swooshing by.  In turn, America's isolation from the world relates as well to the Overlook's isolation.  Third, the film is about the illusion of middle-class ownership.  In The Shining, Jack and Wendy appear to own the hotel-having it all to themselves, but in reality they are merely employees, owning nothing.  Fourth, the movie is about the historical brutalization (not just genocide) of minorities-Wendy's victimhood representing the real-life equivalent of women, Dick's the equivalent of black Americans, and Danny's the equivalent of children.The film isn't perfect, and one of its most disappointing aspects is the climax, when Jack-other than outside the bathroom-never really gets close to Wendy with the ax.  Had this happened, the film would have REALLY had a suspenseful climax.  Another serious disappointment is the lumping of homosexuality at the end (e.g., the bedroom's ""gay"" scene) with the other horrors of the hotel (e.g., the ghoulish man dripping with blood, the roomful of skeletons, etc.).  Unfortunately, this lumping of homosexuality with creepy things is common, even nowadays, in film, TV, and writing, and the fact that this happens in a highly thought-out movie is an even bigger horror.  Because people generally accept well-presented things uncritically (e.g., a visually flawless movie), it is imperative that incidents like Kubrick's depiction of gayness in The Shining be viewed and spoken about with critical eyes.Most viewers who ask, ""What was that movie about?"" have simply failed to see the hidden meanings of this film, but once uncovered, this film makes perfect sense.Other than that, The Shining is one of the best filmed and acted movies in the history of moviemaking (e.g, the Steadicam scenes, the meticulous camera shots, Nicholson's snarls and facial expressions, etc.).

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3DJMO0WZNJ8N5	Alan Seals	"I went to see ""The ""Shining"" in the movie theater back in 1980 when it originally came out.  At 13 there were some parts of the plot I couldn't grasp at the time, but even then I knew a great movie when I saw it.  The movie, like the book, takes place in the heart of the Rocky Mountains of Colorodo.  As an Oregon native, however, I immediately realized that the shot of the outside of the Overlook Hotel was made using Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood in Oregon.  The inside shots were filmed in England I believe.  Trust me, though Timberline Lodge is a beautiful place, it doesn't look like the inside of the Overlook Hotel.The movie deviates some from the book.  The 1997 miniseries version is much closer to the book.  Kubrick and the writers use so many great suble tools to make the movie effective.  The characters are interesting enough.  Jack Torrence is a former school teacher who is insecure (we see in the movie he fears having to work in a car wash).  He is also a recovering alchoholic.  There are hints that he left the teaching profession under duress and that he is an abusive father.  Still, the Jack we see for the first half of the movie is a steady person.  It is during the second half of the movie that the more sinister parts of his character start seeping through.The Shining reminds me of The Ring in some aspects as it uses quick but powerful images to direct the movie.  As you see the movie more times, you pick up on more subtle details of the movie that you missed before.  Therefore it is definately worth owning.  Some details of the movie remain a mystery to me.  What did Mr. Grady mean when he told Jack that ""you have always been the caretaker here""?  This idea is apparently revisited at the end of the movie when we see him in a photograph at a New Year's Eve Party from early in the century.  Though the movie leaves many mysteries behind, it is a modern masterpiece and is definately worth buying and adding to your library."	5.0	Stanley Cubric's Best Movie	2006-05-08	8	2	6

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A9UU8OR0TBMHE	Alexander Nordquist	"The Shining, based on Steven King's novel is a masterpiece! I usually don't watch horror movies but this one was not like many I had seen before. What I like about this movie was it was not unpleasent to watch, and I say that because I don't like movies with a lot of gore. This movie had some but since the movie was very interesting, I was still able to watch.The movie is about a family that is hired to watch a summertime hotel over the winter. Jack Nicholson plays as Jack Torrance[father]. Shelley Duvall plays as Wendy Torrance[mother] and Danny Lloyd plays as Danny Torrance[son]. Jack has really been in this hotel before and that's why when Jack first walked into the hotel he mentioned: ""it seems like I have been here before"". Danny was born with something called the shining which means that he can see things that may have happened a long time ago, or things that might not have happened yet. So, Danny and Jack begin to see very strange things around the hotel and eventually it drives Jack crazy and he wants to kill his family.I thought that the movie was very well done. Jack Nicholson's acting was very good and it seems that he is the one that really fits to the character. The special features is also interesting, featuring the making of The Shining.

The direction is so utterly unsettling it will have you on the edge of your seat and leave you cold at the end, the true elements of any horror film.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1SQFUCSPMUE8I	ALF	It's tough to believe that Stanley Kubrick received a Worst Director Razzie nomination for &quot;The Shining.&quot; While &quot;The Shining&quot; may not be given the classic status of some of his other films like &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;2001&quot;, it's actually the least polarizing of this highly-praised and atypical filmmaker's work.This atmospheric thriller is sure to creep you out with its pacing, eery editing and cinematography (those tracking shots are highly effective), and Jack Nicholson's powerful performance as Jack Torrance.  Horror films often tend to divide audiences into genre fans who follow the gore and those who laugh in the face of so-called scares, insisting their own resiliancy to cheap thrills and lamebrain plotting.Fortunately, &quot;The Shining&quot; doesn't make you take sides, because its chills come from plotting and character study as much as they do from odd sights that will make you jump. It may stray from Stephen King's book and not all of it may make sense, but &quot;The Shining&quot; has so much going for it that you won't mind. It's a gripping and satisfying film experience, and in my opinion, one of the best films of the '80s.This Warner DVD re-release is definitely the version to get. The fullframe presentation comes at the wishes of Kubrick and the video and audio offer significant improvement over the drab initial release. (Unfortunately, the original Mono audio track has been dropped altogether in favor of an effective 5.1 remix. They could have included both with no problem.)In the way of extras, there is an engaging half-hour on-set documentary, filmed by Kubrick's daughter Vivian. It provides a candid experience of the film's creation, and interviews with some of the actors. In addition, this DVD re-release includes an audio commentary on the documentary (sort of a &quot;making-of the making-of&quot;) by Vivian Kubrick. There's also the spooky trailer, which shows how a movie preview can perfectly pique one's interest in a film, without spoiling (or even saying) much.	5.0	Heeeere's Johnny!

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A4PTUEVFE13K6	Allen Chapman	"""The Shining"" is one of my all time favorite movies, saw as a little kid and it scared me to death. Years later I watched it again and loved the movie. Many people either love or hate the movie based on the fact that it strays pretty far from the Stephen King novel. The way I see it is like this, the book was incredible, the movie is incredible, they are two seperate things and should be viewed as such. The only problem with the movie is the casting. Nicholson and Duval were both perfect and horrible casting at the same time. Nicholson plays the madman to perfection, but you never see him as a loving father and husband. Duval plays the terrified wife perfectly as well, but you get the feeling she's lived her whole marriage in fear. You don't believe these two would have ever gotten together. Because of this, the first half of the movie is a bit hard to swallow, once she reads what Jack's been writing however, the casting is perfect.As for this new edition included are two new documentaries about the movie with interviews with crew from the film as well as Jack Nicholson and others who are fans of the film (Steven Spielberg for instance). The docs are interesting to watch and learn about some of the behind the scenes stuff. There is also a piece with Wendy Carlos who did the music for the film. Too bad the soundtrack is not in print, it is by far THE scariest music from a film ever. If you can find a copy somewhere, give it a spin sitting alone in your house at night! Creepy stuff.A nice upgrade from previous editions of the film."	4.0	The classic just got better	2007-10-23	12	10	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A84F07TF9PAED	Amanda	I read The Shining several months ago and found it to be very gripping. I attempted to watch the movie shortly there after and found myself honestly bored; it was dragged out with not much action. I stopped the movie about halfway through. However, upon the suggestion of my boyfriend and several others I decided to give the movie another shot. Very glad I did. Though there is not much action to speak of, if you sit back and really watch the movie and understand the characters it gives you a look into the human mind and how easily it's corrupted. Jack Nicholson was, in my opinion, perfect for this role. He captured every essence of Jack Torrence from the book. I would have liked to see more of the hedges and the hedge animals as they were a big deal in the book. And the ending didn't grasp the book as much as I'd have liked. Overall, a classic.	4.0	A look at the human mind	2010-12-11	3	1	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AWR915QOQA8D3	Amazifier	"Who would watch a movie like this and why? That's, good people, what I'll tell you. Do you like horror movies, visual art, a good romp through psychological waters with a comedic twist? No? Well, you'll still like this. The plot will make you think, don't worry. For a first time viewing during the beginning you may find yourself going, ""What the...?"" but trust me. You will love getting scared to this. Now for some fun facts to aid in the visual digestion process. The movie was taken from Steven King's novel with the same name. King didn't like it because the plot was changed but Kubrick, genious that he was, decided to show what people would do in certain situations and leave the viewers to decide why. Stanly Kubrick, the director, used some camera angles that are so original no one knows how he did it, so be prepared for some roller-coaster visual effects with no computer technology aiding the way. Who better to play the part of a man turning insane than Jack Nicholson? His spiky eyebrows will get you every time. The characters show tons of emotion and you have to wonder how it looks so real. Well, it's partly because Kubrick took take after take to get the actors riled enough. Old Jacky looks and sounds like he's just about to throw a chair out the window? Close. I hear people quote the movie all the time. It's just right for a horror flick, that's all, and the scenes stick in your mind. So in conclusion why should you watch it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's better than Psycho. There's slashing and gore but it isn't all mindless---it really shows a lot of truth in situations. What would you have done....seriously...and also what's all the plot about? Watch with a friend and you WILL start to talk about it.

And after watching this on DVD last night I noticed a few things (even though my friend The Nostalgic Critic made a very good review) I noticed something last night. Even though Jack is played by Jack Nicholson who is pretty much the same in every role (I'm not saying he's not awesome though) They make the reference that he's just playing Jack Torrence as well, Just &#34;Jack&#34; when that Isn't true....(even my friends noticed this. Take the beginning.....when they're driving in the car...and he's talking about The Donner party. He's still being his Scary self.....but it's the start of how the character is. Then we have when he's upstairs....he's trying to write but nothing's coming in a bad case of Writers block before he starts getting Cabin fever....and the Nightmares. Now this is another thing as Shelly Duvall walks into the hedge maze with Danny (and Shelly Duvall is NOT as bad as Everyone says (and now that I've seen both movies I actually like BOTH casts.) And one of the best scenes is when the ghost start up Jacks drinking problem again, now I always loved this scene. We were all reading about this as well and it said in this internet encyclopedia....that the rooms in here don't make ANY logical sense. But the only rooms that seem off..are the hallway the girls are in, the Gold ballroom and that weird bedroom, and these are my favorite rooms in the place (but I also love Every room in the Hotel ( in both movies....with no surprise to my guy or Any of my friends....Room 237 being my favorite.) But then with how I am, what I like to watch, and what I like to write....I was born to be scary.	5.0	All Work And No Play Makes The Scream Queen A Dull Girl	2013-10-27	0	0	0

Needing, like all writers, some isolated time away from society to work on his assignment, he decides to become the winter overtaker of the Overlook Hotel, which sits on a lonely monutaintop in Colorado. During snowstorms, the lone road there is impassable, so Jack and his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) will be completely alone for a whole five months. But instead of finding the Muse at the hotel, Jack discovers other things that might not be so pleasant, or hopeful. His son is seeing strange, bloody visions of the previous family that had stayed here. What's behind room 237? And why is a once loving father carrying that axe?Stanley Kubrick's film is reported to be very different from the novel by Stephen King, but since I haven't read the King book, I can't really compare. Whatever he did, however, the film is an effective and suspenseful piece of existential horror. The claustrophobic tracking shots down the hallways are very eerie the first time you see them, as are the visions that Danny (the son) sees, especially of the two little girls. However, if you're a horror film buff, you might find that this film isn't all that scary--it's often too slow-paced and deliberate (in Kubrickian fashion) to be too scary, and by modern standards the body count is very, very low. (The death scenes aren't as frightening as some of the title cards like ""TUESDAY"" to me!) The film ""shines"" mostly in Jack Nicholson's frenzied and passionate acting and in Kubrick's cinematography of the hotel; though many of the scenes and lines are familiar to movie buffs, it's still amazing to see his growing insanity on screen. Ultimately, this film is an exaggeration of the frustration of being a blocked writer. Those of us who write probably all at least thought the same words that Jack recites here, in one of the memorable lines of hte film: ...Most of us, however, manage to refrain from wielding axes afterwards. :)"	4.0	An Effective But Not-So-Scary Allegory of Writer's Block	2003-03-13	3	1	2

It's been popular consistently for over two decades.It's tough to make a great horror movie. Most of them come out and then instantly fade away and a year later no one remembers them. Who will remember ""The Ruins"" and ""Prom Night"" a year from now? I started forgetting them twenty minutes after I saw them. One had something to do with singing plants and the other was probably about a prom and mostly likely took place at night.The Shining is one of those movies that have become so ingrained in our culture that if you haven't seen it you really miss out on a lot of other things as this movie is still referenced constantly. Even commercials would be hard to ""get"" without seeing this. I mean, just a few months ago there was some cellphone commercial that featured the twin girls from The Shining haunting a cellular ""dead zone"".What makes this movie so great is that it's not just a Halloween hack-n-slash. There is a plot and they spend time building up to the insanity, so that you get drawn into the characters and actually care what happens to them. The actors, the music, the directing.

There is a feeling of a paranormal environment, manifest by the lighting, the sharp contrast of colors white, blue, red and fog in some of the scenes. And, this special environment is made even more surreal by the very special soundtracks of ""Atmospheres"" by Gyorgy Ligeti , ""Timesteps"" by Wendy Carlos, or the  score in The Shining by Carlos' couple too.

Of all of Kubrik's work, this so far stands as my personal favourite.The film doesn't follow the story too closely to the book.  There are many scenes from the book that are missing (""Stephen King's The Shining"" is a closer adaptation).  But it still follows the basic story about a family who takes care of the Overlook Hotel and confronts ghosts.Kubrik's adaptation offers much to think about.  The way the scenes are established still makes me wonder if all the hauntings are real, or are part of the character's imaginations.  The source of the film's horror stems from a psychological kind of aspect and to me alludes to a greater kind of dark force.  That is to say that the horror of the film is not in the ghosts, but in the characters' growing insanity and darkness.  The madness of the characters is real, and is very well portrayed (especially by Jack Nicholson).For all its brilliant acting and provocative cinematography, this film captures the sheer horror of Stephen King's original novel and shoves it deep in the human mind."	4.0	Heeeeeeere's horror!!!!!!	2003-01-25	0	0	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AOMDGKZTVIE9P	Andrew Collins	Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall), and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) are on their way to an isolated hotel in the mountains on Colorado. Jack is a writer who accepts a job as the hotel's caretaker during the winter off-season. He hopes the isolation will give him the peace and quiet he needs to concentrate on his writing. At the same time, Danny appears to be suffering from abnormal behavior and experiences horrifying visions. As the winter weather moves in and the roads become impassable due to the snow, strange happenings start to occur at the hotel.I found this film to be quite an interesting watch. Although I myself am not really a fan of the horror genre, this film is a classic and it really shows off Stanley Kubrick's skills as a filmmaker. The cinematography and set design alone make this movie simply amazing to watch. Add on top of that Jack Nicholson's almost hypnotic acting starting as a rather typical person slowly descending into madness.I thought, however, that the film felt rather long. While there are really no bad scenes in the film, some of them just seemed to drag on longer than necessary. In addition, some bits seemed out-of-place in the film, apparently holdovers from the novel which are not explained in the film.Overall, I recommend this movie to those interested in horror films or just those wanting to experience the genius of a Kubrick film.	4.0	Interesting, if Sometimes Long	2014-07-05	0	0	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	There are few films that can deliver the same chills and feeling of eminent dread that `The Shining' manages to bestow upon the viewer each and every time it is watched.  Just about every frame is perfectly crafted to entice genuine feelings of misery, fear and anguish.  This is one of those rare films that can stop your heart dead cold while simultaneously causing it to beat louder and faster than it has every beaten before.  `The Shining' is, in all honesty, one of the most effective horror films every filmed.But, thankfully, it's also one of the smartest.Yes, `The Shining', helmed at the capable hands of Stanley Kubrick, proves to be far more than a slew of cheap thrills but in the end becomes a fascinating film, one with enough `hidden' messages and meanings to keep the audience guessing long after the film has wrapped.  I love films that move you to ponder the vision behind it, and Kubrick has always been known as the supreme visionary.  `The Shining' is no exception.  When you look at Kubrick's work you can see his ability to make something deeply disturbing and ultimately `important'.  Just look at `A Clockwork Orange', `Eyes Wide Shut' and the obvious `2001: A Space Odyssey' and you'll see that Kubrick is far from a `simple' director.  So then `The Shining' would no doubt be far from a `simple' horror film.  When you watch and dissect all of the clues and tricks Kubrick places throughout the film (there are whole websites dedicated to this film and that very purpose) then you will begin to see this film in a whole new light entirely.Couple Kubrick with the intensity that is Stephen King and you have the potential for greatness.What I think happened here, sadly, is that many `horror' fans were expecting to see King's novel transported onto the screen; nothing more, nothing less.  Kubrick is not that simple.  If you look at what he did with `A Clockwork Orange' (although he did stay `truer' to that work than this) you can see that Kubrick always makes his films his own.  The same is true with `The Shining', but to a greater extreme.  Stanley Kubrick gave us his interpretation of the novel.  I admire this, adore this even.  Kubrick was a fascinating director who took chances and risks and they almost always paid off.  This is a masterful example of those risks working wonders for the finished product.The film follows the Torrance family; Jack, Wendy and their son Danny.  Jack and his wife have been asked to care for the `OutLook Hotel' for the winter and they are more than looking forward to the task.  It doesn't take long though for this task to turn into a burden when strange things start taking place and Jack begins to descend into the darkness of insanity.I don't really want to say much more about the plot or the events that unfold.  This is a film you really must see to fully appreciate.  What helps elevate this film is Jack Nicholson's flawless performance as Jack Torrance.  I'm going to broach the same subject I jostled around when reviewing Tim Burton's `Batman'.  Jack Nicholson always plays a variation of himself; and I adore this about him.  He's one of our greatest actors ever even if his range is slightly jilted by his overpowering demeanor.  I am the one person in all humanity who disliked his turn as The Joker.  I just thought it was too much.  It was an example of Jack playing Jack poorly (in my opinion)...but Jack Torrance is the supreme example of Jack playing Jack masterfully.  All his eccentricities are here in fullest form and they add so much to the fear permeating the film.  Any other actor would have fallen flat in my opinion for no one else can play Jack like Jack.  `The Shining' may be a smart film, but without Jack it would lose a lot of its chill-factor.When you take a flawless director and take a flawless actor and give them free reign with a flawless script you have a flawless film; no way around it.The other actors in the film have their ups and downs.  Danny Lloyd us very, very effective as Danny Torrance.  Next to Nicholson, Lloyd is perfectly cast.  They work off one another brilliantly, and Lloyd effectively carries one of the most spine-chilling scenes in the film (`redrum') and manages to stay with the viewer long after the credits have rolled.  Shelley Duvall is less effective (thus the Razzie nomination).  Her whiney annoyance is a little much to take at times, especially towards the films conclusion.  I won't give her too much flak though for she does prove to be frantically stimulating (especially in that bathroom scene) at times.  When every other facet of the film is perfect you tend to forgive effortlessly the minor faults.In the end I must say that `The Shining' is in a league all its own.  As far as horror films go, there really is no better place to look.  Unfairly snubbed by every awards body at the time, `The Shining' is seriously one of the finest films ever made.  Kubrick was a master of the lens, and this is a superlative example of that very fact.	5.0	One of the smartest horror films of all time...	2008-05-05	4	2	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2O7MOWVMSKO5J	Andy Gill	This review is going to be a metaphor for the movie, in that the title has little to do with the content, it's overly long, it's repetitive, and people are going to be divided as to whether it's great or just a complete waste of time and talent.So what's the film about? Is it Jack's slow descent into madness? Well, no, he's a psycho from the start, evinced by Wendy saying in such an obviously ominous way that he once dislocated his son's shoulder in anger. Indeed, his manic grin and arched eyebrows don't become more manic and more arched as the film progresses - it is obvious from the film's opening scenes that he is going snap and try to kill his family. Resultingly, there is no tension whatsoever.Is it, therefore, about a would-be author suffering writer's block? Well, no, because he spends months writing the exact same words - not the actions and frustrations of a blocked writer, but the behaviour of a psycho. And, again, the frustrations don't develop - all the knobs are turned up to max throughout, so there is no sense of impending disaster.So is it about a family that falls apart at the seams? Well, no, because the family is never really a family to begin with, so there is no frame of reference - the family is dysfunctional from the offing.Then is it about a child's burgeoning psychic abilities? Well, no, because other than seeing a couple of ghosts, which both his father and his mother can do, and talking in a silly voice, it adds absolutely nothing to the plot, short of giving it a title and using it to provide a body for Jack to axe.Therefore it must be about a haunted hotel, right? Well, by now, you probably don't even care, but I'm going to keep going anyway, just as the film does, on and on and on. It's about a haunted hotel in the same way that Ghost Ship is about a ghost ship - an excuse for a couple of cheap thrills and low-brow special effects in an attempt to be `scary'. And, like Ghost Ship, Stanley Kubrick missed the concept that `horror' relies upon a sense of dread based upon the human fear of what lies out of sight - the darkness at the end of the passageway, the malevolence that watches from the shadows - and not upon a couple of people in period costume who we assume must be dead.Now I have to add a sprinkling of pretension, because we find that in every Kubrick film: The movie's lack of inherent humanity, its stale motifs and soporific pace leading to a sudden orgy of Dionysian extravagance, fail to believably convey the essence of a human being struggling to maintain a thread of sanity amidst a vision of dystopianism and an overriding sense of ennui. The symbolism of the empty hotel reflecting the yearning loneliness of the soul that is the human condition, far from validating its own position, serves merely to strengthen the apathetic interactions between the viewer and the screen. The movie therefore acts as the antithesis to its own goals, failing to engage the individual while attempting to elucidate a universal notion of the individual's concept of Self in relation to Other. Furthermore, its utilisation of dichotomies - sane/insane, reality/fantasy, natural/supernatural - fail to resonate upon any level beyond the visual.If you want a scary, haunted house horror, the original version of The Haunting, based on the Shirley Jackson novel that inspired King and others, is the definitive 20th Century haunted-house-as-basis-for-psychological-thriller. If you want a Kubrick film in which his detached style adds to the plot, rather than detracting from it, watch Full Metal Jacket. If you want a film that puts a human face on trying to keep a family together amidst the supernatural, watch Stir Of Echoes. And if you want to watch a film about a guy who goes psycho in a place of geographical isolation, Dead Calm is a must-see.And now that that's over, to maintain my metaphor of the film, I need to end this review and leave you feeling unsatisfied, confused, and a little annoyed: Frank Sinatra sang about flying to the moon, but he died.

The film is two and half hours long and the pace is not pretty rapid, things start out slow but the tension build and the exotic, thrilling atmosphere is created successfully, such that the characters make your eyes get glued to the screen completely and you find yourself holding your breath to observe their consequences. The film may not be perfect and leave you wanting for more, but the strong performances really make up for tiny flaws.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2C0X7WOIHNFTX	Anthony J Novak	"Stanley Kubrick's landmark film is based on one of Stephen King's best novels.  The book is great, and the movie, though very different from the book, is pretty good.The story centers on a writer (Jack Nicholson) who takes over the position of caretaker at an isolated Colorado resort hotel.  Soon, he and his wife and son are snowed-in at the hotel.  Soon some ghosts begin to appear. And sooner than both of those things, Nicholson begins to go nuts.  That's the one key difference from the book--as in King's ""The Shining,"" the caretaker slowly begins to lose his mind in a subtle, seductive way.  In Kubrick's version, Nicholson's caretaker is pretty much insane from scene 1.The movie is filled with many iconic images, that even if you haven't seen the film, you will probably recognize.  The film also has a great score.  If the movie has any flaws--it would be the slow pace and the lackluster performance from leading actress Shelley Duvall.The DVD includes a creepy trailer and a very-good ""documentary"" about the making of the film.  The best part of the documentary are the clips of Kubrick absolutely torturing lead actress Shelley Duvall into getting the scene right.  It's the type of uncensored, unapologetic look at a director that you wouldn't see today.  Just to let you know, The Shining is shot to fit your Standard TV screen, so there is no widescreen version available."	4.0	Dark, Scary Horror Film	2006-11-07	4	1	3

Brimming with amazing camera effects, terrifying sequences of outright horror, a great score and, as one of the most diabolical characters in cinematic history, a dynamite performance by my favorite actor, the one and only Jack Nicholson.Author Jack Torrence (Nicholson) has been hired as an off season caretaker at The Overlook Hotel, a secluded country getaway located high in the snow covered Rocky Mountains. Of course, there's a little story behind the hotel, a story of great terror. This does not seem to frighten his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall), but his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) seems a little...apprehensive about the situation. When the family arrives, everything seems fine at first. But slowly, Jack is beginning to lose it. His temper is growing shorter. He's beginning to have nightmares. He sees disturbing visions. He's become a loose cannon, and no one knows why...or do they? Danny learns of his special pyschic gift known as the shining, and what he sees are visions of great error.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A238W091256DTY	Anthony Ochoa	As a technical director in a very subjectional thinking media business, I can fully understand why some &quot;bad comments&quot; &amp; &quot;bad reviews&quot; of the &quot;bad DVD&quot; were given.  But...while working  for a very single minded...very focused...very perfectionistic media talent  myself, I more so understand Stanley Krubrick's request to have the viewer  &quot;view&quot; the work as &quot;he&quot; viewed it.  That is to  say...one mindless reviewer said something to the nature that the DVD  version on his home theatre &quot;surround-sound-dolby-pro-logic-5,000  channel-THX-super-dooper-cienema-head &amp;  balls-to-the-wall-megaplex-titanical-killer&quot; system sounded....WEAK!

If  it looked &quot;hazy&quot; or &quot;fuzzy&quot; and sounded  &quot;narrow&quot; or &quot;pointed&quot;...well maybe...just  maybe...that's the way Krubrick &quot;specifically&quot; invented that  particular wheel to &quot;specifically&quot; carry his particular  thought's.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	ARA48345JZPZR	Archmaker	...crazy as a loon! When Shelly Duvall started reading page after page, neatly typed and spaced and formed in different paragraphs and indentations, the same sentence over and over it gave me chills, as she and we realize just how crazy her husband has become. This is pure Kubrick, not Stephen King. Frankly, the whole movie is pure Kubrick and very little Stephen King. Thank God. If you want King, see the sorry mini-series.Only Stanley Kubrick would make a ghost cum haunted house (in this case haunted hotel) movie brightly lit without deep shadows and no one jumping out of the dark shouting &quot;Boo!&quot;. Even when Jack kills Halloran it is under the brightest light in the room. And the bright lighting of the movie is just the first departure from the usual scarey movie formula.Nicholson's performance is a point of contention for many. I loved it. His Jack Torrance isn't some nice guy being possessed. He is a deeply disturbed man sliding into total madness. His scene where the months without alcohol has put him to the edge of fury until Lloyd serves him his first drink and the drunk's bravado &amp; expansive b.s. emerges is classic. And when he turns to Wendy who approaches him sitting alone at an empty bar, his just-off-the-mark and a seconds-slow focus and cutting reply to her shows us he's really drunk even if she doesn't see it.As he slides into the abyss, we see Nicholson become abusive and crazy and capable of murdering his own family.The movie is full of great Kubrick touches: the tracking shot following Danny on his bike with the great sound of the wheels on carpet then floor then carpet then floor; Room 237; REDRUM; &quot;Here's Johnny!&quot;;the wall of blood; and so on. It also has typically odd points of humor in the performances and direction.Like all of Kubrick's later movies, I initially felt a sense of disappointment upon first seeing them. Only because I had such anticipation and he had raised his own standard so high it was inevitable it wouldn't match hopeful expectations. But I came to revere every effort on later viewings. Each film is so unique and goes where others haven't. This was true for The Shining as well.The movie should probably be 4 to 4-1/2 stars. But I miss Kubrick so much, I can't rate it any less than 5. He was a daring and challenging artist, and we will not be able to travel with him to new places any more.PLEASE NOTE: I am rating the movie, not the DVD.	5.0	All Work &amp; No Play Makes Jack.......	2001-07-08	2	2	0

I never read the book, so I had nothing to base it on. The only other movie of Kubrick's that I remember seeing would be 2001 and that was terribly boring. The only part I liked was Hal, that scene was pretty cool.In short, it sucked. I knew it would suck when I looked at the counter and noticed nothing happened 45 minutes into the movie and it was going to last roughly 2 1/2 hours.He did a lost of showing when he should have been telling or showing what was necessary for the movie. Nothing really developed. Nothing happened for 45 minutes, then all of a sudden he's getting mad at being interupted by his wife? What was eating at him? Was he having problems with coping with not drinking? I don't know, there was no hint at what was going on internally with these characters whatsoever. It was all showed, nothing was told. Why? Because Kubrick had no idea of what he was either trying to show or say, he just pretended he did.The black guy travels all the way from another state just to get killed and provide a vehicle?

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2VMT89TCSF105	"Ashtar Command ""Seeker"""	"Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" is a classic horror movie, starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. The movie is loosely based on a Stephen King novel.The movie is, of course, a turkey. It's not a co-incidence that ""The Shining"" has been frequently lampooned over the years. Especially the evil twins. Another iconic scene shows Nicholson looking at us through a big hole in the bathroom door. Here comes Johnny!Personally, I was scared by this movie when I was about 10 years old. Today, I suspect that the only people who like it are Stanley Kubrick cultists. But then, they like ""Eyes Wide Shut"" as well.However, I readily admit that Jack Nicholson is excellent starring a man slowly descending into madness. He always is. Now, *that's* scary."	1.0	A shining turkey	2010-02-25	19	1	18
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A30N4QJJMR7RD9	"A. T Mauro ""amauro@indiana.edu"""	Film is a seperate medium and you should never attempt to directly copy the original written work. The book will always be better, because ones imagination personnalizes the experience.This film is top notch and Nicholson is flawless. Young Danny Lloyd is also superb. I read a review where they thought the kid was a downer. Since Danny is privy, from the opening, that evil exists in the hotel, then I would expect him to be terrified and depressed throughout the film. I think it would not have worked for Danny to be a little giddy, when his world is crumbling down. Take a look at Danny's expresion when Scatman is killed and he's hiding in the kitchen cupboard. Priceless! Kudos to Kubrick and Danny Lloyd for playing it correctly throughout.Another complaint was the pacing, as many thought that the film dragged. I can only assume that you've grown up with the modern blockbuster, action film. You have not acquired the patience for a film to develop tension and suspense. Oh well, there'll always be plenty of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; type films to dull your mind with.My favorite scene is still the one between Jack and Mr. Grady in the bathroom. The tension created is incredible and it's also the point where the audience sees the connection of Jack's character to the hotel.It's a great film with a marvously tight script, superb direction, perfect pacing and terrific ending. My only minor complaint would be the awkward acting in some of the secondary scenes. Duvall could have been better and Scatman looked uncomfortable at times.The new DVD remastered version is very good, with a great 5.1 surround mix.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1IBC9XP2LICQL	A. Wolverton	People who view &quot;The Shining&quot; usually fall into one of two categories:  those who love it (having never read the novel), and those who hate it (having loved the novel).  My opinion falls somewhere in the middle.  If you don't know the story by now, you can read the other reviews to check out the details; I won't present them here.  I also will not judge the film on the merits of the book.  Such a comparison would not be fair.Many fans and critics will agree that Kubrick's &quot;2001&quot; is a masterpiece of science-fiction film making.  &quot;The Shining&quot; came so close to being a horror masterpiece, that you just wish someone could fix it.  But, it's too late for that.  In Kubrick's defense, the images look wonderful.  Kubrick had a great eye for what he wanted to paint on the screen.  He was so careful and meticulous that every scene &quot;looks&quot; right.  The scenes are clear, uncluttered, and exactly what he wanted.  And of course the Nicholson performance is great, as we have come to expect.  Kubrick's choices of music are creepy and set just the right mood.Now for the problems I have with the film.  For those unfamiliar with the story, the pace is extremely slow.  I know that Kubrick wants to build a certain amount of tension and build a reasonable foundation, but he also asks his audience to stay with him for a very long time.  Some of the scenes don't work well.  I really like him, but I thought Crothers's scenes were very stiff and unrelaxed.  Sadly, very few of the scenes with Shelley Duvall work.  It's a very weak performance.  Any actress who wants to work opposite Nicholson had better be up to the task, and she just wasn't.  An almost great film.The DVD itself is rather disappointing as well.  It was a real let-down to see that Kubrick had not chosen the widescreen format, but I got over that.  The distributors, however, SHOULD have taken care that the print that we see was the best one, free from scratches and dirt.  The video transfer is very poor in some places.  I was really looking forward to the documentary by Kubrick's wife about the making of the film.  This too was a disappointment.  While she gives us a glimpse of how her husband worked, Mrs. Kubrick includes too many scenes that don't really tell us anything about the making of the film.  Also included are long scenes from the film that we've already seen.  Again, a disappointment, but better than nothing.	3.0	Jack, Yes!  Kubrick, Yes!  Duvall....well....	2001-02-05	9	2	7

I think it's just as good either way. King should be happy. This is one of the better film adaptions of his books(the other good ones being ""Stand By Me"" and ""Misery""). Jack Nicholson stars as family man Jack Torrance. He gets a job as a caretaker for a large hotel that's closed for winter. He brings his wife and young son along with. The eerie hotel is filled with possessive spirits. Little by little, day by day, Jack begins to go mad as the spirits start to take him over and turn him into a crazy, murderous psychopath, who turns on his family. Sound scary?. It is. There's nothing scarier than when something evil is after you and there is no escape. You can run, but you can't hide. The actors are over the top brilliant. Nicholson. What can I say?. He is one of the greatest legends we have. This is one dandy of a teriffic, classic performance. Nobody else could have done this role. NOBODY. He is creepy and mad, and will get under your skin. There are a few classic(and often hilarious)lines and scenes here. Nicholson delivers them in a pitch perfect portrayal of a normal guy driven to insanity. Shelley Duvall, as his victimized wife, is very effective as well. Director Stanley Kubrick really filmed this classic very well. Establishing the hotel and it's creepy inside was filmed just right. It's long, empty, silent corridors and rooms. Oh lord. It's scary just thinking about it. Some people have problems with the movie. That is too bad. Some others think Nicholson's performance was pure ham and was really overacting. Some times, people, what seems like ham and overacting is what's best. It's acting. Some people don't understand that. All in all, this is a good, well made movie. A classic!."	4.0	"""All Work And No Play Makes Jack A Dull Boy...."""	2001-12-27	0	0	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3O808B3JB26GQ	Bayfia	Recently, I decided to re-read the book, &#34;The Shining&#34; because I want to read it's sequel, &#34;Dr. Sleep&#34; about Danny's life as an adult.  Well, I know that will be scary too... after all, Stephen King is this century's best author in the horror genre.  In any case, I felt that I needed a refresher before starting the new book.  Re-reading &#34;The Shining&#34; scared the heck right out of me again!  And it brought back memories of the film, which was so terrifying that I wasn't able to sit through it without running into the theatre lobby  when the suspense became too intense.  If you go to the horror film to be shocked, disturbed, and genuinely frightened by the story, The Shining is definitely the film to see.  It's nationally rated as one of the top 5 horror films ever produced, and I strongly believe it earns that designation.  You don't need to read the book first to appreciate the suspense and the sudden revelations that will frighten you.  Of course, reading the book first will make the film version a bit easier to understand, and quite a bit more frightening in the bargain.

Touted as ""the first epic horror film"", THE SHINING is a love it or loathe it affair depending on whether you are a Kubrick fan or a King fan. Which is where I have a problem as I am both.For those of you who are unfamiliar with the story, it centres around Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a struggling writer and recovering alcoholic who takes over the job of winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel, even after learning that the last caretaker went mad with ""cabin fever"" and killed his family. So Jack moves in with his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) who has a psychic ability which allows him to see the future (or his imaginary friend Tony does). Both book and film get these points across. Here Danny befriends an old man named Dick O' Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who also has the same ability as Danny (""shining""). But soon Danny starts having disturbing visions: the word REDRUM appearing on walls, blood gushing out of the elevator, two identical twin ghosts show him a vision of his butchered body etc.But none of this is scary at all. Odd, but not scary. In fact the creepiest part of the movie is when Wendy reads Jack's manuscript... The scene featuring Nicholson and the dead woman in the bathtub is suitably gross, but not scary.Personally though I feel that the movie is mostly a huge disappointment, Kubrick has virtually  completely restructured King's masterpiece and concentrated more on the character of Jack Torrance than on giving the viewer explainations as to why he is going mad. That isn't what mainly bothers me, as I love the psychological stuff; but the fact that Kubrick tried making a horror film without knowing anything about them. Viewers were also expecting great things after the disappointment of BARRY LYNDON. I have mixed feelings about the movie. The casting was pretty bad too: Nicholson, though a terrific actor never really grows into the role and Shelly Duvall is just awful. Danny Lloyd is pretty bad too, it's hard not to burst out laughing when you see him talking to his pinky, it's not creepy; it's just plain ridiculous.

Stephen King's horrific bestseller has not entirely been adapted to the screen, and some of the changes that director Stanley Kubrick makes are strange yet they work all the same. If you read the book, which in my opinion is about equal, then you may not agree. Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall give two glass-breaking, over the top performances but Danny Llyod and Scatman Crothers give two great performances here.The film centers around a caretaker, who is watching over the spooky Overlook Hotel in the Rockies for the winter. But what he doesn't know is that the hotel is filled with ghosts, not pleasant ones either. Nicholson slowly begins to lose his mind [although it seems strangely quick on screentime] The ghosts are scary, yet not your traditional transparent things. The camera work, the editing, and just the feel of it all though is what makes this a modern horror classic.My advice is to read the book first for better understanding of the story, but never fail to catch this movie alone at night. One thing it never lacks is thrills and spooks! By the way, don't ever watch the horrible 1997 remake, and don't get the titles confused either.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1EKTLUL24HDG8	Bill R. Moore	"The Shining is one of the all-time great horror films, and excellence in several general areas makes it transcend its genre. It is not director Stanley Kubrick's best or most ambitious film but is another jewel in his unparalleled crown; that he was able to master a genre seemingly so far from his territory on his first try is a true testament to his genius. Fans of his denser films may be disappointed by its relative lack of substance, but there are plenty of his signature skills, and those usually not keen on him may be pleasantly surprised.The film has almost no equal for psychologically thrilling horror. No other film I have seen has held me as expectant; my eyes were fixed on the screen with great intensity and simply could not look away. The tension quickly reaches a fever pitch and never lets go; at times it is near-unbearable - in the best sense of course. Few films get the pulse racing quicker and keep it beating as fast.Most remarkable of all is that it does all this with almost no traditional horror trappings. There is only one onscreen murder and very little of the usual guts-soaked slashery. Kubrick showed in 2001:  A Space Odyssey that what we do not see is often more powerful than what we do; our minds fills in the blanks more forcefully and powerfully than anything overt likely could have. One would be very hard-pressed to find a more successful ""less is more"" example. As in the past, Kubrick also uses music very effectively. Nearly all horror films try, but very few are as successful; it not only builds suspense and heightens foreshadowing, but sparseness is again used to great effect. The points at which it stops are often at least as important as when it begins or plays.The cinematography is also incredible; Kubrick had long had a deft hand at this but truly outdoes himself here. The camera work is near-faultless, and several shots - such as Jack locked in the pantry with his hand on the release - are nothing less than brilliant. The famous blood flow sequence is even better; one of the best scenes ever, it is the preeminent example of how the film uses the power of suggestion to achieve highly-wrought effects one would not have thought possible with such sparseness. Similarly great is the segue from Jack looking at the maze model to his family walking in the actual maze - a superb visual sleight-of-hand on par with 2001's legendary bone/spaceship transition. Lighting is also excellent; dimness is of course another horror film clich&eacute;, but Kubrick uses it with rare precision and purpose, achieving just the right effect without being obvious or overbearing. Finally, one must not fail to mention the many breathtakingly beautiful shots of both natural beauty and luscious indoor settings.The basic plot is not horror's most elaborate; simplicity is again key. However, the execution is almost dizzyingly complex. The mix of hyper-realism and strong supernatural overtones was daring and highly influential. Kubrick included innumerable complexities ranging from ubiquitous mirrors and all they signify to deliberate continuity ""errors"" to plot ambiguities. The story is told so that many apparently supernatural elements can be naturally explained with varying probabilities. Almost every scene can be interpreted multiple ways, leaving us as dizzy and disoriented as the characters. This is a film that truly rewards close and multiple viewings.As for the acting, it is of course top-notch. Jack Nicholson's signature performance is one of the greatest ever. Though frightening in the best sense, it is also screamingly funny; the film's wealth of black humor is indeed one of its most overlooked elements. It is very hard not to focus on Nicholson, but six-year-old Danny Lloyd also deserves great praise. His is one of the toughest and best child acting jobs of all-time; particularly impressive is how much depth and emotion he conveys silently.The closest thing to a downside is something that should be obvious considering that The Shining is unashamed horror - it lacks the philosophical depth and profoundly meaningful themes of Kubrick masterpieces like 2001 and A Clockwork Orange. This is not to say it is without them; there are indeed perhaps as many as the genre allows. For example, like Joseph Conrad's classic story ""Heart of Darkness,"" it shows - especially via Jack - that vicious brutality lurks just beneath humanity's ostensibly peaceful and normal surface. It is in danger of coming out at any time and certainly will with the right stimuli. The ballroom scene is also a subtle colonialist critique, and there are nuanced depictions of alcoholism's dangers and family relations. The Stephen King novel on which the script is based focused more on these last and some other issues, disappointing King and some of his fans, and some Kubrick hard-cores bemoan the general lack of profundity. However, nearly all viewers will consider this nitpicking, and it will do little, if anything, to detract from their enjoyment.All told, The Shining is absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in horror, Nicholson, Kubrick, or King and is indeed so generally excellent that anyone looking for a supremely suspenseful and entertaining film should check it out."	4.0	Top-Notch Horror and More	2010-03-18	2	1	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AIMR915K4YCN	"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby"""	To me, THE SHINING has to be looked at from several different angles. First, as a horror movie THE SHINING is a classic in the same league as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN,  and ROSEMARY'S BABY. Then, I look at how it stacks up as a Stanley Kubrick movie. In this regard, it's also a classic, with it's isolated / desolated atmosphere, and cold, vast set-pieces. Next, I judge THE SHINING against other Jack Nicholson films, and yep, his Jack Torrence role is up there with his take on the Joker in Tim Burton's BATMAN and his version of Satan in THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK. This is malevolent, crazy Jack at his best! Lastly, I ask myself how good THE SHINING is as a Stephen King movie. Well, it's right along-side of CARRIE and THE DEAD ZONE as far as I'm concerned. I loved King's novel and have read it many times. I just see the book and the movie as two completely separate entities that can be enjoyed on their own merits. So, I give THE SHINING it's due as a chilling masterpiece...	5.0	Do Not Disturb...	2008-03-22	4	2	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2TAPL67U2A5HM	Bjorn Viberg	The Shining~ Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite movies of all time. Nicholson is amazing in the role as Jack Torrence and Duvall is not bad as his meek and sweet wife Wendy Torrence. The suspense and the psychological effects are harrowing and Jacks descent into madness is truly frightening. The music is very similair to that of Hitchkocks Psycho. The movie is so much better then the book and Kubrick has turned a fairly mediocre book into one of the best horrror movies of all time. Danny Lloyd was amazing in his one and only role and it is truly strange that he did not star in any more movies. This is one of the best horrror movies of all time and like I mentioned earlier Nicholson does a stunning job with the role. He should have won an academy award for the part since it is truly astounding.	5.0	The Shining  ~ Jack Nicholson	2006-04-07	9	3	6

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1ZY7N9F82F9EA	"""blivet"""	You can read Stephen King's masterpiece or watch the late Stanley Kubrick's swan song, but either way you are in for a dark, twisted, foreboding and haunting jaunt.  The idea that King was irate over Kubrick's vision so much that he oversaw a made-for-television venture that all but tanked, had to have been a rumor. For how could the master spellbinder have issues about one the greatest horror films ever to come out of tinseltown?  Ok, so the hedge animals were deleted over a hedge maze. It doesn't really matter. If you watch any other horror movie adapted from King's work it is clearly apparent that King was given complete authority, because every last one is horribly constructed(except maybe, Misery). King is a writer, not a filmmaker. I think perhaps King was jealous of a man(Kubrick) who brought his idea to life so well, that people thought of the movie as more significant in the years to come than his novel.  As always Kubrick gives us a horrific painting with a pulse. His colors and lighting techniques are second to none. If this were a silent film, it would still chill the spine because of these two elements alone. Enter the music and sound effects and you have a Kubrickian nightmare that you will not be able to escape until the last shocking scene and then some. As far as the actors are concerned the casting is flawless. Nicholson is a bit over the top, but this is a horror film we're talking about. Shelley Duvall is spectacular, but I got the sense that Kubrick hired her to get the audience to root for the Nicholson's devilish persona. In a morbid sense, it's almost like you want Duvall's character to die. The woman she plays is so weak and feeble-minded that its true wonder that she stays alive at all.  Again, this is in-your-face Kubrick. He is a man who has known no boundaries in his filmmaking as he has pushed the corners of creativity and the intensity of the imagination to expand into a cold, unrelenting study in what will disturb us indefinately.  In that respect, I refuse to believe that King was completely disappointed with this film. Insofar as this review is concerned, this is a must see movie.  If you like King, if you like Kubrick and if you like horror films you owe it to yourself to swing your hatchet into this one. Watch it more than once and take in one of King's finest stories and one Kubrick's most haunting interpretations. This may also be one of the only times you will be able to say in confidence that the movie is just as good if not better than the novel that inspired it.	5.0	The KING of KUBRICK	2001-07-09	1	0	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2Z28WKY1LHBKY	"blockhed ""blockhed"""	Jack hams it up and the script is cheesy. Stanley sure worked very hard: perhaps that's why he was such a dull, dull boy. This film is allegedly based on a good Stephen King story, and some people think it was influenced by Resnais' immaculate masterpiece Last Year at Marienbad. Well, it does look as if Stanley had actually seen Marienbad, but he clearly had not the faintest idea of what made that movie so sublime. Stanley's sandwich is no picnic. As usual, he relies entirely on design, design, design. As usual, the narrative is slow, slow, and plodding. Laboured. Leaden. Ponderous. The suffering actors, driven mad, not by the mind-numbingly dumb plot, but by Stanley's obsessions. There is absolutely no subtlety or even sense in this production. The fact that the cavalry will come to the rescue, summoned by telepathy (they usually do arrive by telepathy), is signalled so early on that there really isn't any suspense at all. The delaying tactics --- the phone lines cut, the radio ripped out, the sno-cat distributor removed, and then the other escape sno-cat not starting quite properly, are just crushingly corny. The only (slightly) surprising thing was that the unfortunate cavalryman, who seemed like a half-way decent person, got axed suddenly. And what happened to his left arm? Or was that bit chopped in the final cut? I'll admit I felt a slight sense of tension to start with, but this feeling soon evaporated; the thing grew tedious, and eventually laughable. The rake-thin Mrs Torrance getting stuck in the bathroom window had distinct overtones of something out of Laurel and Hardy --- or am I thinking of Pooh Bear wedged in the rabbit-hole?  No, she wasn't carrying an ounce of fat. And who was that naked lady in the bath? Judy O'Grady? A portent of things to come in Eyes Wide Shut, perhaps. What about that final shot: I suppose we were supposed to understand that Jack was a re-incarnation of a man who'd lived in 1921; but it still doesn't add up. When I started writing this I had two stars at the back of my mind, based on the design/cinematography, the counterpoint idea of having a would-be terror/horror tale shot in day-bright colours and mainly with massive lighting; but no, one star will have to suffice. You still have to admire the way Stan the man won a reputation as one of the 20th century's greatest film-makers on a body of work so much of which is basically nothing squared, or even cubed.	1.0	Ham & Cheese	2006-03-10	32	13	19

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	`The Shining', directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on the novel by Stephen King may be one of Kubrick's best movies, and may be the second best rendition of a Stephen King novel on film (next to `Carrie') and yet I understand Herr King has little respect for this film interpretation of his work. This is odd because aside from this work and the aforementioned `Carrie', there has been little of quality done on film with King's novels. I do confess that the TV miniseries based on `The Stand', arguably King's best novel, was decent, but I think that was only good, not great.I always feel a very personal connection to this movie, as it's announcement was the reason I started reading Stephen King novels. I was in my local corner book store in Nyack (pre Borders / Barnes and Noble megastores, where the salespeople really knew your name and tastes) looking for `something new' to read in fiction. The owner / manager happened to suggest a new paperback copy of `The Shining' and I was unimpressed until I saw that it was scheduled to be made into a movie by Stanley (my very favorite director) Kubrick. That sold me and I snatched up the paperback faster than you can say `Here's Johnny'.As it turned out, I was very pleased with the novel in its own right and set me off on a history of buying each Stephen King novel in hardcover as soon as it hit the bookstores (pre Amazon.com advance ordering). So, when the movie finally did come out (Kubrick always seemed to take forever between the announcement of a project and its final release), I rushed to see it with the same enthusiasm I had for `2001' and `Clockwork Orange'.My reaction upon my first of many viewings was mixed at best. The first thing which bothered me was the way Jack Nicholson hammed up the part of Jack Torrence. His irritable leering give away the threat to wife and son long before King does in the novel. I believe it even starts before the little family actually takes up residence in the Overlook hotel. Nicholson partially redeems himself when he falls into full homicidal lunacy and does his famous bathroom door scene.On Kubrick's part, his adaptation of the story overall is good and his blocking and cinematography is superb, but we would expect nothing less from Kubrick. The one area where he falls down is when he does not convey King's point that it is the hotel and not something Jack Torrence brings with him, or a simple case of cabin fever, which brings on Torrence senior's madness. Kubrick also minimizes the role of the chef, reducing his second appearance to nothing more than a device to bring a working snow cat to the hotel.And yet, the movie endures and its reputation in my mind grows with each passing attempt to do justice to a King novel on film. `Misery' with Kathy Bates' Oscar winning performance has joined the select few good King movies, but most seem to simply drop to the bottom of the barrel of notable horror movies.So, in the end, I have to give Kubrick high marks for succeeding where only George Romero has done well, out of all the King cinematic attempts, including some done by King himself.	5.0	Kubrick sets the bar for Stephen King movies.

Not to mention that this is one of the (if not the?) best reviewed movie of its genre.  Let's just say the movie itself is great.Now, on to the Blu-Ray review.  When I first bought into the Blu-ray format, I told myself that I'd stick to buying the new releases primarily, thinking ""how good can they really make older movies look without a digital source?""  Having said that, I decided to pick up The Shining, mainly because I love the movie and the only other copy I own is the VHS tape.  In one word: WOW.  I don't know if it's because I skipped the SDDVD step and went straight from VHS to Blu-Ray, but it really is like watching the movie for the first time.The picture is stunningly crisp and detailed-- there are innumerable details that I never saw/noticed in the SD version and the colors and contrast are phenomenal.  The flesh tones are even and consistent and they've really shaken that washed-out look of the previous versions.  I felt like I was ""inside"" the Overlook Hotel, and this makes the experience of the film all the more unsettling and terrifying.There is definitely a bit of noticeable grain here and there.  Whether it's intentional or not (if not, the movie IS almost 30 years old...), it doesn't detract from the awesome hi-def experience of watching one of the most psychologically disturbing movies of all time.  If you're a fan of this movie and own a Blu-ray player, well... you probably already have it.  But if not, there's no time like the present!"	5.0	Awesome Blu-Ray Transfer	2008-02-13	6	5	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3J2CGLKCCPSBE	Bragan Thomas	I used to think this movie was terrible - overproduced, overlong, and cursed with some of the worst performances in cinematic memory.  Then one night I rented it for a lark and found myself unexpectedly swept up by it.  After the film was over, I went to bed and had one of the worst nightmares of my life, dreaming that I was trapped within the hedge maze and running frantically from a screaming Jack Torrance like Danny in the movie, only I was unable to find my way out of the maze.  I woke up drenched in sweat and didn't sleep for the rest of the night.  Any movie that could do something like this to me must be great!  I have since watched it again, and am astounded by the film's tension, general atmosphere of unease, and I have come to greatly admire the fine acting of all the principals. Kubrick's Overlook Hotel is one of the great sets in the history of filmmaking.  The photography, camera work, and compositions are all spectacular, and the film gains greatly from a truly exquisite use of music (a soundtrack was released very briefly, but it is long out of print).  This film has the simple yet compelling structure of a fairy tale, and some of its images have become mythic in themselves - the unnerving bird's-eye views of Jack's car driving through the forest, Danny cycling through the endless corridors of the hotel and suddenly being confronted with vision of the dead girls, the scene between Jack and the non-existent bartender, the horrific scene where Jack threatens Wendy on the staircase, and of course the final bathroom and maze sequences.  This DVD offers the film in stereo for the first time, and having a stereo soundtrack greatly improves the viewing experience.  And by the way, there is no widescreen version available because this film was not shot in widescreen to begin with - it was filmed in the traditional 1:33 aspect ratio and &quot;masked&quot; by Kubrick into a horizontal format when it was released.  What we are seeing now is actually MORE of the total image than was originally seen in theatres, as can be noted if you take a close look at the great opening sequence, where the shadow of the helicopter supporting the camera is quite clearly visible in the lower right corner of the screen for a few seconds.  So stop griping about the widescreen issue, folks, because it isn't going to happen!  This is a very great film that richly rewards repeated viewing - it is my personal favorite of Kubrick's after 2001.

Also, Dick Halloran was important to survival in the book, but in the movie he comes all that way and dies! What a ripoff! Also, Bill Watson made roll on the floor with laughter in the book because of his dirty talking humor about the woman in the tubs history when she was at the hotel and her grandson!

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2LYJ89DKSCOM7	Brenda L Shields	I saw &quot;The Shining&quot; a few years back and am presently reading the novel; despite the former being based on Stephen King's novel, I see them in two entirely different categories. Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King are brilliant in entirely seperate ways. The novel is good and even though Kubrick changed a lot of things, I must say that the movie is equally good. It's sincerely creepy to it's credit. Who didn't feel a chill up their spine when Danny is riding his tricycle around with dizzyingly effective camera scenes only to come upon two twin girls in a hotel that is supposed to be deserted? And the ocean of blood cascading out of the elevator is sincerely creepy. Jack Nicholson's performance is nothing less than extraordinary and reading the novel I started out thinking it would have been better for Jack Torrance to have gone from nice with a bad temper to totally insane instead of all ready slightly off his rocker as portrayed in the movie, but you know what? It's Jack Nicholson, who with his sinister eyebrows and piercing eyes just wouldn't seem right in the role of a nice guy. I consider the Jack in the book and the one in the movie two very different people. Nobody else besides Jack Nicholson could have played Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's, &quot;The Shining, he's just so genuinely creepy and not someone you'd want to be barricaded in a hotel with. I would rather Kubrick hadn't taken such liberties with Wendy, however, who was described as blonde and lithe in the book; the total opposite of Shelly Duvall in the movie. She got the hysterics of Wendy down well enough, but I think an actress closer to the one in the book would have been better. The absence of the topiary scene is rather sad too because in the book it's genuinely creepy and I don't think it would have been too difficult to do as long as the audience had experienced the animals from Jack's POV since he never actually sees them move. Put in the rustling sounds and get someone to cut the animals differently and it would have been a nice edition. Like I said though, the movie and the book are very different. Both the movie and the book are scary. I can see why Stephen King didn't like Kubrick's version since it strayed so far from the book, but I think of &quot;The Shining&quot; more as a movie LOOSELY based on a story written by Stephen King. Hey, it was done with &quot;The Body&quot;, a short story written by King, which became the cult movie &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. So if you see the movie and read the book, making comparisons is pointless because they vary in numerous ways.	4.0	Book and Movie Almost Entirely Different	2001-12-10	2	0	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2LLWO2030A41A	Brittany	"I know this is often considered one of the scariest movies of all time, and I will admit that it has its moments, but good grief, I've never seen a horror film that is so slow to build up to anything remotely scary.  All scenes involving the supernatural are excellently portrayed by the actors, but since I'm rating the film on its overall composition it has to take a hit for all of the cheesy dialogue scenes in the first few scenes.  In particular I have a hard time stomaching the character of Wendy.  I wasn't a fan of her in King's novel either, but at least there she seemed to have some backbone, and I wasn't treated to a visual representation of her 80s ""fashion"" -- I mean, I'm not particularly picky about clothes, but enough with the unflattering dresses and red socks, already!  This Wendy looks too meek to even consider locking her husband in a pantry, let alone fending him off with a knife: she can't even remark on how beautiful the hotel looks without sounding like someone in a cheaply made infomercial.  Jack Nicholson didn't do much for me, either (and he really proved how terrible he is at pretending to drive -- rocking the steering wheel back and forth...really?  I've only ever really seen that in B-movies.), until he finally had to  start acting insane, and then I thought he was brilliant.  He really seemed to make the transition from sanity quite abruptly, though -- I think that aspect of the film could have been written out more clearly and more believably.  Also, I'm not sure if Danny Lloyd was actually voicing ""Tony"" as well or if he was dubbed, but regardless, the Tony voice was the creepiest part of the movie for me -- I can't even think about ""redrum"" without getting chills now.  The ghost scenes were legitimately creepy as well, but all and all I can't say that this film lives up to the title of best horror movie of all time, at least in my book: to do that it would have had to capture my attention from the beginning, and the first 30 or so minutes of The Shining are so tedious that they may prevent some from being willing to view the rest of it."	3.0	Not sure how to feel about this one...	2010-10-08	7	2	5
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AHSS38LAX6E97	BrooklynBrand	It's always hard to lasso the entire depth and essence of a story from a book and transfer e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g onto the screen, yet Kubrick manages to capture the bone chilling horror of King's story and pierce the audience with this icy and utterly disturbing film.Stripped down to bare bones this movie is packed with:1. Classic crazy Nicholson in all of his psychotic glory. No one, and I mean no one does it better.2. A perfectly cast Shelly Duvall as the mousey, abused wife who would aid anyone's spiral further down into the abyss of insanity.3. Some pretty chilling acting from a terrific little 6-year old (Danny Lloyd); who, by the way, was unaware that the movie Kubrick was shooting was a horror flick.4. Scenes of disturbing images that pulsate throughout the film, and manage to stay with you long after the movie is over.5. One hell of a great haunted hotel story.Whether you read the book or not, this movie will not fail in thrilling and chilling you to leave one or two lights on, check in the closets, peak behind the shower curtain and maybe, just maybe, have a very restless night's sleep. Ever since the first time of seeing this movie, I still don't see long stretches of hallway (especially in hotels) the same.	5.0	All about Jack	2013-11-01	1	1	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1GB0HW46Y2EB	Bruce G. Taylor	"Even though I've always had the highest regard for Stanley Kubrick's work, I do have mixed feelings for ""The Shining"". Even from the first viewing, I never felt that it terrified me as much as it should have.  But it is a film I do re-watch from time to time simply because visually, like most of Kubrick's films, it is so satisfying and the Blu-ray version is even more so.  I won't dwell on the screenplay or performances except to say that they are sometimes yes, sometimes no.  But the Blu-ray disc does bring out the technical achievements of the movie.  The cinematography is excellent as one would expect, but the frequent use of the Steadicam, being used here by Kubrick for the first time, does begin to call attention to itself.I'm glad the BD was released in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio since I'm  quite certain that it was presented in theaters using a 35mm print in 1.37:1 aspect and masked in the projector to get 1.78:1 or something close to it.  In the early aerial shot of the hotel as shown in the 1.33:1 DVD, the blades of the camera helicopter are clearly visible at the top of the frame.  I'm certain Kubrick would never have allowed this, given his attention to detail and I don't think that by 1980 there were many theaters in the U.S. showing movies in 1.37:1.  The video quality of the Blu-ray release is impressive in its clarity, color balance and freedom from graininess and the helicopter blades are nowhere to be seen.Somehow I get the impression that the musical portion of the soundtrack is a little too much of a good thing having been, I believe, remixed at a higher volume level relative to the dialogue track for this release.  The music for this film was taken mostly from existing concert pieces by Bartok, Ligeti, et. al.  To have the greatest effect for this film, the music, in many places, should be rather quiet and needling rather than intrusive or overbearing as it often is.  Playing this film in a totally dark room and at a lower than usual audio level will help provide the feelings of uneasiness that the viewer should have.This release makes me pine for a Blu-ray release of Barry Lyndon."	4.0	The Shining in Blu-ray Worth the Trip	2010-07-02	12	10	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1TONI9A0YFOD6	Bruce Rux	"Stephen King's best book becomes Stanley Kubrick's worst movie. As usual, Kubrick's cinematography is incomparable, but it's almost the only worthwhile thing in this epic mess.The characters are completely unsympathetic. Alcoholic madman Jack Torrance, hired to be winter caretaker of Colorado's (fictional) Overlook Hotel, is plainly crazy from the first moment he appears on camera, so going to the point where he attacks his hapless family with an axe is such a short step that there's nothing surprising about it. His wife, Wendy, is annoyingly simpering, making it hard to care that her life is in danger. His son, Danny, is virtually catatonic throughout the film, and only shows any signs of life toward the end, when menaced by his crazy father - the rest of the time, he comically talks to his finger in a really idiotic voice, which makes no sense at all. The only sympathetic character in the lot is that of the Overlook's cook, Halloran, who exists as nothing more than a plot device to deliver Jack's captive family, and then die a violent death (which is itself rather unconvincing).The film itself is disjointedly chaotic, and deathly slow and overlong. Scene separators are employed that are inconsistent - at one point, a card on the screen tells the audience it is ""December,"" at another point one reads ""10:37 P.M.,"" and a later third one reads ""Thursday."" Since none of these things are in the slightest important to the plot, they are nonsensical to begin with, and all the worse for their lack of any unity. Similarly, act headers such as ""The Interview"" appear for no worthwhile reason, and throw the viewer out of any semblance of continuity of action. And the question of whether the Overlook Hotel is actually haunted by real ghosts or only by one mad alcoholic with an axe is so inconsistently addressed that to even attempt commenting on it would itself sound confused and inane.But worst of all, the film simply isn't scary. It has more unintentional laughs than anything else. And that's when it isn't boring the viewer to sleep. The use of scary-sounding atonal music is almost an overkill telegraph to the audience, screaming, ""This is a scary movie!"" because, if it wasn't there, no one would know the movie wasn't supposed to be a cartoon black-comedy. And it doesn't work, both because it is overused and because it builds, repeatedly, to...nothing at all.This is just an incomprehensible film, no matter how you look at it. Read King's terrific book. And if it's Kubrick you want, watch any of his other films, almost all of which are terrific."	1.0	What Happened?	2002-05-25	74	38	36

But The Shining comes very, very close.Reading the reviews here is a clue to what makes The Shining so special.  Most of the negative posters seem bored by the movie (as well as unable to spell or construct a complex sentence).  It's not a movie for children or those with a child's attention span. One example: the scene where Jack and the hallucinated bartender have their first conversation lasts for over five minutes; we keep waiting for some sort of shocker (e.g. the bartender turns around and has no face, or something like that).  Instead,  Kubrick keeps the scene disturbingly normal, brilliantly allowing Jack's delusional paranoia to feed on itself, which of course is the real horror of the movie.  This kind of patience and craft is lost on those used to more pedestrian gorefests, but for those who appreciate subtlety and humor along with sheer mounting terror, it's just one high spot in a movie filled with them.	4.0	Second scariest movie ever made	2004-04-23	6	4	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2EDRFWI8AL6NH	Bullitt68	Everyone knows Stephen King hated Stanley Kubrick's movie version of his classic horror novel. But Kubrick has been known to take certain parts and mold them into his OWN version (for example Lolita, 2001, etc.). Even though it strays pretty far from the novel, it packs a punch because that is what Kubrick did best, make engrossing films! Although you may have trouble following some of the plot and others may interpret it differently, you can still enjoy the madness that builds along the way. Some have criticized Jack Nicholson's performance as over the top, but I like it even more after each viewing.I recently reread the book and saw both movies again (the t.v. mini series that King wrote and produced) and each of them has it's own place. So if you like horror movies, put this on your list. But maybe you should NOT read the novel first and enjoy it for what it is, a stand alone horror classic.	4.0	Not like the book, but stands alone as a horror classic	2013-09-21	1	1	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A388ZDFVK72VCA	"Cale E. Reneau ""Mound of Wires"""	"The Shining is one of the horror genre's most notable films.  Made in 1980 by the late, legendary Stanley Kubrick, the film stands out as not only one of his best but probably the best Stephen King adaptation as well.  Though not nearly as true to the book as the later TV-movie would be, it is undoubtedly darker, more macabre, and ultimately superior to that version.  Kubrick was a genius behind the camera, giving us long, beautiful shots, allowing us to take in both the beauty and the horror of the Overlook Hotel.  For those who have yet to see the movie (and honestly, who hasn't at this point?), do yourself a favor and buy it today!  Disappointment is impossible.As for the transfer of the film, it is unbelievable.  While clearly not as visually stunning or breathtaking as modern day flicks, this HD DVD version of The Shining boasts a virtually flawless transfer and cleans up many of the blemishes that were present on previous VHS and DVD versions.  Black levels are deep, clean, and ungrainy and the majority of the film offers a surprisingly clean look.  Detail is not as strong as it could have been, but Kubrick intentionally shot this film softly. The images won't pop and shine like modern movies will, as this is an old film, but for the price of the disc you are without a doubt getting the highest quality transfer this film has ever seen.Audio has been upgraded from a mono to a TrueHD soundtrack, but for the most part audio will be very front-heavy.  Most of the peripheral speakers are used only for music, to intensify the sound of it (and it is effective).Special features are slim: the old making of documentary (with or without commentary), theatrical trailer, and a few small featurettes that delve deeper into the making of The Shining, as well Stanley Kubrick's ""Visions.""  All pretty standard fare, all in 480i/p standard definition.Whether you're a long time fan of the film, or new to it, this is a must-own if you own an HD DVD player and HDTV!

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1PJZKEZQGREDY	California Dreaming	I rarely go to the movie theater.  Nowadays, why would someone want to, unless perhaps he wants to see some special feature, such as &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; in 3D.  Even then, the BD disk will be out soon and many people have 3D sets at home.  (I could argue that 3D for home use won't be usable until 4K TV is available at a reasonable price, where you will enjoy passive 3D with 1080P minimum per eye.  But I digress. . . .)  Or maybe some people like the idea of hanging out in an uncomfortable theatre with a bunch of screaming kids.  Well, not I.But there is a downside to avoiding the theater.  There are so many older movies that I've never seen before in their original formats, or even in HD.  So, I've been making a point of rewatching some of these films in their original 16 x 9 HD glory, and &#34;The Shining&#34; is one example.  And I must say, I surely wasn't disappointed.  The cinematography is fantastic, especially many of the outdoor scenes in the mountains in Colorado; I believe that that is where it was filmed, but if not, who cares?  It still looked amazing wherever it was.  And even the indoor scenes just looked much better and brighter as well, especially all of the blood on the walls.  It was as if I'd never seen the film before, and was watching for the first time.You already know the plot, since you've seen this film yourself at least once.  But there is some really good dark humor here.  My favorite:  the Jack Nicholson character is arguing with the wife character, and he says something like, &#34;I had a dream.  I dreamed that I killed you and Danny.  But I didn't just kill ya.  I cut you up in little pieces.&#34;  Now, a line like this must have the correct delivery.  And Mr. Nicholson's delivery is perfect.This film has a lot of symbolism, and I'm sure that symbolism has been argued ad nauseum.  But I believe that the main theme might be something like:  &#34;People never pay attention to warning signs, and they just plow forward until they skid off the road.&#34;  This is true with the child character, and this is true with the Nicholson character.One issue that I did have:  early in the film, when the child character seems to have imaginary friends, a female psychiatrist character is introduced that interviews him.  Now, based upon the questions she asks him, it is obvious that she is probing to determine if he is schizophrenic.  Now, any psychiatrist would know that this disorder rarely -- if ever -- occurs in people before their late teens, and he is much younger than that.  So, this was a little bit of a plot device that didn't quite work for me to help drive the rest of the story.A pretty big recommendation here by me, even for a second or third look.  Especially in HD.	4.0	Still Shines Today (in HD)	2013-02-27	0	0	0

The first movie I ever saw Jack Nicholson in was One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest, and then I saw him in this, so I automatically see him as crazy, his wild eyes and forehead and that hair help with that vision greatly! Although the book explained what Shining was in more detail, Kubrick shortened it enough to get the point across, to me his films although they are visceral and sometimes leave a bad taste in your mouth, are so cleanly lit and the sets are maddeningly perfect.I was certainly scared, of ""that"" room, the lady in the tub, the twin girls, all the blood, but what I was most scared of was how badly that hotel wanted that family to suffer and die, and how desperate Wendy was to save her child and realize that by doing that she had to kill her husband. Kubrick really got across the struggle between disbelief and the resolve to survive. The only thing I couldn't stand, and its no fault of Kubricks, or Kings, but the whole ""redrum"" chant to this day is a bit comical for me, because everyone copies it, holding up their finger, making their voice strange and gravely, I even do it at inappropriate times, like when I see some kid in the mall with a bowl cut.

Nope, Kubrick didn't want the actors to be bad, as his many fans claim, they were bad because they couldn't act. It's that simple. Duvall and Crothers were so bad, they couldn't even rank on the fun, cheese factor scale.Kubrick directed this so it must be art ? Nope. He tried to get oh-so-artistic but failed miserably. Besides, who wants ""art"" in a horror film, especially ones that concern ghosts ? Not me.Jack was intentionally hammy ? Was he ? Maybe he was actually trying to be serious and wound up overdoing evrything and it turned out ""hammy."" True horror fans know that ham does not belong in a horror film.Scary ? Could someone please tell me what was scary. When you have a horror film that's badly acted, and the  attempts at depth and artistic merits result in silliness, how can it be scary ? Distracting is a more appropriate word.This film has so many metaphors and hidden messages ? Well, again some attempts were made, but the results were shallow and nothing more than vanity from the director.The Shining is a film that tried so hard to be ""more"" than a horror film, but, in the end it's not even a likable horror film or a success at whatever it tried to be."	2.0	"a beloved and ""scary"" horror film ?"	2005-09-23	20	6	14

I'm glad that it is available ""On-Demand"" so my son and daughter (now that they are old enough) could see this with us.Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall put in great performances as ""Jack"" and ""Wendy"", respectively, and young Danny Lloyd plays a very creepy Danny\Tony. This is an adaptation of Stephen King's novel by the same name, while it is not as accurate as the later TV movie, it is every bit as creepy and even somewhat more disturbing.Even though this is an older movie and book, there will be no plot spoilers from me: The story centers around a family (Jack, Wendy, and Danny) who take on the winter upkeep of a mountain hotel in the ""off season"". Jack is hoping to use the time to write a novel, while Wendy and Danny are left to their own devices. Like many King stories, the location and history (both explained very early) of the hotel are key plot elements. Nicholson's portrayal of a man slowly going insane is truly brilliant and some of the lines are very memorable.Many of the scenes are often spoofed on popular modern shows, which is why we wanted our teens to see it. I should note that there are a lot of disturbing and gory images all throughout this movie, including some full frontal nudity that I honestly hadn't remembered was in it (likely because I first saw this on ""Network"" TV). While not a traditional family movie, there are obviously some scenes that can be somewhat awkward.Even with all of that, this is still a fantastic movie that has become part of our popular culture.Highly Recommended!CFH"	5.0	A Classic Horror Movie - Highly Recommended	2010-07-28	1	1	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2J7B7F2J7V4DM	Chosroes III	"Kubrick's joyously pessimistic, counter-Nietzschean remake of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" finds a paradoxically rhapsodic filmmaking style to portray a nightmarish universe governed by malevolent supernatural forces (or is it that Time itself is a malevolent force, or the key to allow our own malevolent urges to work through eternity?).  Taking the glacial beauty of the ultra-aesthetic ""Barry Lyndon"" and revving it up with free-floating Steadicam action, endless tracking shots and zooms both somber and shocking, Kubrick makes ""The Shining"" a hyper-stylized art object.  What other space in cinema feels so inhabitable, so tangible to its viewers, as the Overlook Hotel?  We might well declare, with Nicholson's Jack Torrance, that we know what's going to be behind every corner.  And yet, all this pictorial seduction is tingling with menace-- and menace made concrete in all the worst forms; Kubrick incorporates themes of child abuse, spouse abuse, self-loathing, lust, madness, murder, even genocide in this cinematic catalog of sin and damnation.  Most disturbingly of all, Kubrick's notorious invocation of Eternal Recurrence reverses the starchild optimism of his ""2001"".  Indeed, by quoting a theme from Berlioz' ""Symphonie fantastique"" (itself quoted by Franz Liszt in his ""Danse Macabre"") Kubrick seems to reverse the Romantic quotations that open ""2001"" (Nietzsche's dawn to Strauss' to Kubrick's).  The Vermeeresque lighting provides an uncanny backdrop for the spectral goings-on; Kubrick and John Alcott's cinematography is flawless both in conception and in its technically breathtaking execution.  Why then has ""The Shining"", like ""Apocalypse Now"", been unable to shake a certain unsavory reputation among critics?  The explanation may lie, not with Nicholson's terrific performance (calibrated, in its exaggerations, to Kubrick's ultimate design) but in the film's uncanny irreducibility-- very few movies hide their most shattering ambiguities as well as ""The Shining"".  And yet it is one of the most compulsively viewable films in cinematic history.  Perhaps no other film comes as close to being a communally shared dream as ""The Shining"".  It is a gorgeous, intoxicating and obliterating nightmare from which a generation has yet to awake."	5.0	Kubrick's consumate statement	2003-01-08	2	0	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1HHYFZXNB2PG4	CHRIS FARRELL	&quot;The Shining&quot; is one of my favorite movies and is especially enjoyable late at night in the dark because of its isolated setting and Jack Nicholson's increasing mania. It is a must see for anyone who is a fan of either Kubrick or Nicholson (his finest performance other than in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;). My only displeasure at watching the film on DVD is the fullscreen format. Why can't this film be distributed in its original theatrical aspect ratio? I feel that we are missing a lot. I saw the film in a theater in 1980 and I think we are missing out on Kubrick's intent in framing each scene so eloquently.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A16TLDIOO355DG	Chris	I am quite pleased to say that The Shining not only lives up to it's reputation but even exceeded nearly all the horror films that have come out since.  The Shining is chilling, it's a subtle movie, at least by today's standards, it is brilliant on levels Hollywood has seems to have forgotten.The subtle special effects are never overdone, never desensitizing us by overstimulating the horror factor over and over again until all the scares blend together.  The absolutely fantastic cinematography and camera direction.  The grand low shots following Danny at his own eye level as he rides around the hotel builds the terror of our expectations and then often denying us what we expect resulting in even greater impact when something paranormal does appear.  The increasingly claustrophobic and uncomfortable shots make us feel like we are just as trapped there as Wendy.  Finally the chaos that surounds Jack as he goes more and more insane.  All of these are perfect in their effectiveness.Jack Nicholson's performance is flawless and and every bit as riveting as the cinematography, I can't imagine how they could have found anyone more perfect for the part.  Danny Lloyd also does a terrific job, especially when his imaginary friend comes out to play.  Shelley Duvall's acting on the other end was fine but did stick out as the weakest part of the movie, but it gets the job done.Of course, all this wouldn't be worth a thing of the story hadn't been so well written, Steven King obviously providing great source material while Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson's adaptation bringing the novel alive in cinema.  All of this a testament to Kubrick's skill as a director.If you haven't seen it you really need to, if you have seen it maybe you should see it again and try to appreciate it on a completely different level, I promise it won't disappoint.	5.0	A Masterpiece of Terror.	2008-12-09	2	1	1

I recall that when I watched it when it first came out and I was younger, Duvall's character 'Wendy' irritated me so much I was begging Jack to 'give her the axe' (I know, what a thing to say). Watching it at an older age, her character doesn't irritate me for some reason. Jack Nicholson's antics always amaze me and I never seem to tire of them. I was surprised to learn in some trivia that Stephen King wasn't happy at first when he was chosen for the role.When an alcoholic on the wagon agrees to isolate himself and his family by taking a winter caretaker position at a large Colorado hotel, it seems like the perfect job, especially for an aspiring writer who hopes to finish his novel. Then old ghosts hatch a plan to tear down the serenity of the lodge and replace it with their haunted past. This movie will still keep viewers on their toes, despite having been filmed in the eighties when many advances in special effects hadn't been made.

Too often, Hollywood is satisfied giving us blood and guts, slasher flicks with supernatural overtones but with little or no substance. In The Shining, Kubrick offers us a ride into madness and hysteria, scaring us with both the real and surreal. Frightening images from this film stand out long after viewing and the horror concepts it introduced have been often imitated. Although it is not true to the King novel, which places the story's focus elsewhere, Kubrick's reinterpretation stands as its own tale of terror.	5.0	....	2001-07-07	0	0	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A25IGV63LRMRLA	"Christopher E. Bivona ""CB"""	"The Shining is perhaps one of the greatest horror films ever made. Like Jack Torrance, its writer, director and creator Stanley Kubrick had an obsession.  Kubrick was one of Hollywood's finest director but he believed everything, including the slightest detail had to be perfect. Kubrick loved Stephen King's novel but felt that it had flaws so he decided with his writing parter that he would take the concept and characters of Jack Torrance and his wonderful adventure in the old Overlook Hotel and create a more eerie and sadistic story.King allowed Kubrick to take his novel and create a movie out of it, giving it a physical life. Although King loved Kubrick's envision of The Shining, he was upset of how Kubrick changed some of the roles of characters and the storyline. King did not believe in Jack Nicholson's character as Jack Torrance, the simple and kind abusive drunk who goes from teacher, to lonely writer to psychopath serial killer. Jack Nicholson has a history of being a bit loony in his films which is obviously true. King did not like Nicholson as a Jack Torrance because he did not want the audience to witness Nicholson and automatically assume that he will turn into a psychopath based upon his history in films prior to the Shining. Jack Torrance at first is to appear as a warm, loving family man who later goes insane due to isolation, alcoholic withdrawal and maybe perhaps the afterlife presence that exists within the hotel itself. King did not believe that Nicholson could play the role of Jack Torrance.Clearly when you watch a Nicholson film, you can see right from the start that he is a truly gifted actor, superior to most of the crap that is portrayed today. Nicholson is able to pull off various roles. He excels in the crazy, psychopath role which is what Jack Torrance later turns out to be. The premise of the Shining is to have a strong believable Jack Torrance, you need, the movie cannot survive without a powerful performance. Nicholson was the perfect fit for this film. He knew, the cast and crew knew it and Kubrick knew it. Although King is a brilliant author, he is as crazy as his characters if he believes that Nicholson was not perfectly suited for this film. The Shining, I guarantee some day, there will be another theatrical remake, whoever assumes the role of Jack Torrance has mighty shoes to fill. They must live up to Nicholson's standards.Kubrick's envision of King's novel is a masterpiece. This film was not nominated for any academy awards... it should have been especially when you see all the garbage that wins awards in today's ""questionable"" standards. The movie should have been nominated for best film, best director, best actor and best actress. Sadly, it wasn't. The movie is brilliant. Kubrick was very obsessed with his work and he didn't care how tired the actors were or how much of the studio's money he was spending, he had to have double digit outtakes on his roles of film for each scene. He was the drill sergeant of films directors. He made the cast and crew earn their paychecks. He drove them insane. When you see crazy yet brilliant performances from Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall in this film its not only because they're talented but also because they were tired of Kubrick that they began to lose it. Their frustration in the film showed in their performances. Nicholson's dramatic impression with the ax wasn't far from the truth, he really was beginning to go insane. Thats why his role in this film is so powerful, because it was real. Although he loved Kubrick, at points he probably wanted to hack the famous director into tiny little pieces. Kubrick in all of his films reached for perfection when clearly he worked with a mortal cast and crew.The Shining is a movie that leaves you guessing because you don't really know for sure whether or not there are supernatural beings living within the Hotel because whatever so called ""ghosts"" you see are either an imagination of the young and gifted child of Danny or the crazy father Jack. The only proof of supernatural beings is when Jack is locked in the food bin and someone lets him out. Now there are several answers to this,  it could have been the wife, it could have subconsciously been the son or the last resort could have been the spirits that are kept alive through  the power and memories of the hotel. Kubrick does not want to give it away to his audience and like Hitchcock, he leaves you guessing. The point of Jack reaching his last step towards insanity must be fulfilled through his great escape from his enclosure. Once free, he not only physically releases himself from his shackles, but mentally his mind goes a muck and he releases the psychopath within that perhaps always was part of him but was just suppressed. The symbol of Jack losing his sanity is when he is at the bar talking to the bartender and he is offered the drink of whiskey. At first, he looks at it and wonders whether or not its right for him but finally he gives in and drinks the alcohol. Keep in mind, Jack was a recovering Alcoholic that had been sober for months. That scene where it takes a few seconds for him to decide whether or not he should or shouldn't drink the liquor, that symbolizes the struggle between his sanity and insanity, two different egos of his mind. Ultimately his sanity is lost.Shelley Duvall, although not a pretty actress to look at, is the perfect choice for the role of Wendy, Jack's concerned wife. King criticized Duvall as not being as strong and Independent as he made Wendy out to be in his novel. This is completely false. Wendy essentially does Jack's job that he originally was hired to do, she is the caretaker of the hotel because she looks after it, runs it and takes care of it. You do not see Jack taking care of the hotel at all. She makes sure the boiler is running she knows the kitchen well, she makes minor adjustments to the hotel while Jack is typing away gibberish on his typewriter. She also stirs Jack's emotions and causes him to go deeper into his isolation which causes him to crave alcohol and later go insane. She looks after the family, especially her little boy Danny. She is the heroine of the film. Duvall  plays a powerful and convincing role. She makes up for her appearance by  acting as Nicholson's foil and you can tell right from the start, there is a good chemistry between the two characters. They portray the average American family because not all couples look like Angelina and Brad, so therefore it is more realistic because people can relate to the characters. Duvall is not the greatest actress, there are far worse but she truly shined in this movie, no pun intended. She gave Wendy life and meaning. Her body language and accent is perfect for the film because at first you get the impression that she is this dumb senseless brunette but she later evolves, showing her true colors and you understand who wears the pants in the family the same way Hilary Clinton dominates her marriage with Bill. She proved to be Kubrick's perfect choice because he was not looking at her face or breasts when he chose her, he was looking into her soul. Many actresses may be pretty but the question is, can they act? Duvall proved her case in the Shining showing that looks are not everything.The Shining was released on HD shortly after Toshiba began creating and distributing HD players and movies. I personally owned the Shining on regular DVD but when I learned that it was released in a more superior format, I jumped at the chance the own the HD version of this film.  I'm not the type to buy multiple formats of DVDs that I already have. The Shining was an exception because this truly is a remarkable film. Its brilliantly acted and directed and the scenery for the time was remarkable. This had a decent budget, it was not a B movie like Night of the Living Dead. This was one of Nicholson's finest performances and probably Shelley Duvall's best. Kubrick's interpretation of the Shining was far superior to the made for TV film that was produced by King himself which was a complete waste of time and not because of the budget and production but the acting was better, the script was better, the props and sets were better and the storyline was more dark and dreary. I do not recommend the TV version of the Shining at all.The HD format looks unbelievable, so much clearer and crisp. This movie was made for HD especially the end when Nicholson shows his true colors, his persona of his own personal life. The extras as the same extras that are on the 2 disc special edition of the Shining. The extras are not in HD but it doesn't matter because your not buying the movie for special features but for the feature itself. The movie looks amazing on a 50 inch 1080p HDTV especially when Nicholson drills a hole in the bathroom door with his trusted rusty friend ax, sticks his head through the hole and yells out ""HEREEESSSSS JONHNNNYYYYYYY!!! This is a must buy. I would recommend buying this movie NOW because very soon, Toshiba will be taking HD movies and players off the market due to the competition with Sony's Bluray. Its also available on Bluray, but if you have an HD player and you want to stock up cheap titles, this is definitely the one to buy. This is a fantastic film, if you don't believe me, check it out for yourself. I hope this review was helpful.- Chris B -"	5.0	Kubrick's version does justice	2008-03-13	4	3	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1WI4GTJRIQ60K	Christopher Griffin	Okay, I KNOW some will say &#34;how could you love horror and have never seen &#34;The Shining?&#34; Well, it's true! as much as I love CLASSIC horror, as much as I love watching Jack Nicholson, as much as I love the works of Stanley Kubrick, and as much as I've read most of Stephen King's books (except The Shining) it was only recently that I sat down to watch it. For some reason whenever I see too many clips of films they seem to go to the end of the line when it comes to be watching them. So yes it wasn't until now (I'm 49) that I finally sat down and watched it. All I can say is WOW!  What an incredible performance by &#34;Jack&#34;! Shelley Duvall was great as that passive wife who would probably begin to grate on any husband over time and little Danny Lloyd was both adorable and SCARY! I was VERY pleasantly surprised to see Scatman Crothers as a pivotal character in this film! Overall, a great actors, great cinematography, great story and a GREAT film from Kubrick!	5.0	I hate to say this...	2013-04-19	0	0	0

You get insight into Nicholson, his rehearsal process and his performance, the tension involving Shelley Duvall, and a strange interview with Scatman Crothers who is really, really (really) happy to be involved with the production.But mostly, you get to see and hear Stanley Kubrick in action. He is, of course, the man.  I'd never heard Kubrick's voice before I saw this documentary and you get to see him really winding some people up -- not just the lead actors but extras as well. Plus, there's a great scene in which Kubrick and Nicholson are explaining revised script pages to Kubrick's mom and I can't say for sure but I think she's bored by it all.  It's classic.A creepy teaser trailer is also included on the disk but not the television preview, which -- when I was 10 years old -- completely scared the bejeezus outta me.

Especially the first bar scene with Jack and Lloyd in the Gold Room. There was also a feel of isolation in the film as well, like you were actually there, that was creepy enough. For those of you who haven't watched The Shining, and are thinking about getting it, I highly recommend that you do. There is not a horror film that could be as great as the Shining, or will there ever be one as great as The Shining.

Everything that previous reviewers have said about the last release of &quot;The Shining&quot; is true.  The picture transfer and sound are horrible.  However, the upcoming release of this edition corrects all that.  It has a brilliant transfer and a 5.1 Dolby audio track.  Just too bad Kubrick didn't want it released in widescreen.  So, if you love &quot;The Shining&quot; don't let the limitations of the previous edition stop you from purchasing the new one.	4.0	Improved DVD	2001-06-08	8	8	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2C3MWVKGGBJFS	Clob Lane	Many people say that hate this version of Stephen King's novel because there are elements that have been changed. It is a fact that the story has been changed somewhat, but the enjoyment that a person can get out of this film is an enormous amount. Jack Nicholson is pure genius as Jack Torrance and the rest of the cast and crew are also very good. The direction of Stanley Kubrick is the reason why this movie is so creepy, and the musicscore is also very eerie. No other movie has scared me this much.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	ALASEBO7GCFAD	CloseYourEyes	**MAY CONTAIN SPOLIERS**First off, let me say WOW. I just finnished this movie, and I came out of the living room in shock. This movie is truly horriyfing, and truly analyzes the transformation from a nice and caring father to a man without a heart stopping at nothing to murder his family and relive the past of the OVERLOOK HOTEL. In the beginning you are introuduced to the TORRENCES. Jack Torrence has accepted a job at the beautiful yet haunting OVERLOOK HOTEL to leave the hectic life of the city and spend several months of peace and quite to work on his novel. When he accepts the job as the care taker for the winter, the whole family moves up into the isolated hotel and starts to relive the horror that awaits in every corridor, around every corner, and in each and everyone of the spirits that are locked within the monstrous walls.	5.0	"""its almost like ive been here before"""	2005-03-26	5	3	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"I'll put this in perspective: the only other Kubrick film I've seen is Clockwork Orange which I didn't like all that much. So I guess in a way it's perfect for people inquiring about this film since I'm not a ""anything director touches is gold"" idea. I've never seen Dr Strangelove or 2001 so I'm merely reviewing this as a movie fan and not a Kubrick one, even though the film is quite good.Jack Torrance is a teacher/struggling writer and a job as an off-season caretaker is just the trip he needs to clear his head. Off to the Overlook Hotel with his wife and son, he takes up residence in there only to find that they're not exactly the only occupants in the place. And Jack starts to find himself changing by the day.Earlier I posted a review for the Exorcist, another well-made horror film and another thing felt familiar: the parody of the scenes. Maybe because they're parodied and lose their shock then many of the images in this film weren't scary but more unsettling. But still, love those parodies(All beer and no TV make Homer something something).  The images however are memorable: the twin girls, the blood getting off the elevator and a guy in a bear suit, qualifying for the biggest ""what the hell?"" moment in film.One thing that did irritate me about the film was the music: it was a bit too overbearing. It's almost as if the music was going ""be scared, hurry up and be scared already!"". Music in essence shouldn't do that, it should supply it without you being conciously aware of it. While it does its job of being very unnerving and being ""scary movie"" music, it felt a bit too loud at parts. Another thing the film had which you I can understand is a large amount of tracking steadicam shots. There's probably at least 15 or so in the entire film.With good performances, memorable scenes and good tracking shots(although really used excessively), it's not the most scariest film ever, it's just a really well-done thriller movie."	4.0	It's more unsettling than scary	2006-01-23	5	3	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AE2KCASMQPMO	"C. Meja ""CMM"""	I bought this movie after I saw A Clockwork Orange and I was all about Stanley Kubrick... and after I saw The Shining I didn't stop talking about for a week. I showed to my friends and my sisters and everyone agreed with me. All those long silent moments... the traveling of the child going everywhere with his tricycle... the production design (the use of those constant forms and shapes in the hotel's decoration)... and those final twenty minutes... all of these things get you into the movie. Jack Nicholson y Shelley Duvall give great performances (it's beyond reality), as well as the little kid going: REDRUM and writing it with red lipstick in the bathroom door. Cabin fever meets a baroque use of images to suggest spirits and evil forces playing through the entire movie. This movie is scary because it has a mood and a tone (there is a sequencial development of the plot and the character's nervous and psicological breakdown) that locks you in the hotel along with the characters. About the DVD... well, I really hate the WB's way to package movies. Their menus are the worst... but the extras are very good... well, the documentary about the movie is pretty interesting...	5.0	REDRUM... EIVOM TAERG!!!	2002-04-17	1	0	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AFIZGT9TPYW8Q	C. Michael Hall	I am not exactly a Kubrick scholar, so my knowledge of this film is somewhat limited compared to that demonstrated by some reviewers.  That said, for the casual viewer, The Shining is a singularly unique viewing experience.  The third act is among the most harrowing in the history of cinema; the use of the then-new technology of the steadycam is incredibly effective at heightening the tension and surreality of the isolated setting; and Jack Nicholson's manic performance is simultaneously over-the-top and chillingly realistic...madness made manifest.  Technically speaking, the Blu-ray transfer is very crisp, and the sound (always important in a Kubrick film, but especially important in this one) is SUPERB.  30 years after I first saw it, The Shining remains one of the definitive American horror films, and the Blu-ray edition is a wonderful representation of the work.	5.0	One of the finest horror films ever made!	2011-10-25	6	6	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2NPQZSNUWQIQU	Cole Sear	The director is Stanley Kubrick, the actor is Jack Nicolson. Right there you know is a great movie. The Shining a great, bizaar thriller about insanity, and what is real. Jack Nicolson plays Jack, a retired teacher-turned writer whom is to take over the Overlook Hotel during the off-season. He becomes isolated and has a severe case of cabin feaver. Eventually, he becomes utterly insane and his wife and son must defend themselves in the middle of nowhere. But what Jack doesn't know, is his son's supernatural power, the shining. The movie, though, starts off slow but grows stronger and more exciting to build the climax. I strongly recommend this to any horror/Nicolson/Kubrick fan. By far, one of Kubrick's best.	5.0	A freakish, bizaar, insaley great horror film	2001-05-21	0	0	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A25ZVI6RH1KA5L	"cookieman108 ""cookieman108"""	While watching The Shining (1980) last night, a couple of things were impressed upon me...the first thing is that Shelly Duvall is one creepy looking woman, what with those humongous horse teeth, gigantic peepers, and abnormally large ears (I kept expecting her to say something like `Take me to your leader..').  The other thing is it seems regardless of the scariest, twisted, most frightening, and just generally demented nightmare I could conceive either while sleeping or awake, there will always be someone out there to top it, and even perhaps, commit it to film, as is the case here.  Based on a novel by Stephen King, adapted and directed for the screen by Stanley Kubrick (A Clockwork Orange), the film stars Jack `I like `em young' Nicholson (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), Shelley Duvall (Popeye), and young Danny Lloyd in his first onscreen role.  Also appearing is Benjamin Sherman `Scatman' Crothers (Bronco Billy), Barry Nelson (Airport), Philip Stone (A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon), and Joe Turkel (Blade Runner).As the film begins we're treated to some amazing shots of snow-capped mountains and lush valleys taken from a helicopter as we follow a car along a winding mountain road.  The scene ends upon a grand, somewhat elegant looking structure we will soon learn is called the Overlook Hotel, an extremely isolated retreat for people who have a lot more money than I do...here we meet Jack Torrance (Nicholson), and he's interviewing for the position of caretaker as the hotel prepares to close its doors for the winter (they need someone to stay on for the five month duration to keep up the place).  Jack's eager to get the job (and he does), as it will allow for him to have the time to work on his writing.  Jack returns with his family, including wife Wendy (Duvall), and their son Danny (Lloyd), along with Danny's imaginary friend Tony (Danny's got some kind of `special' abilities of an extra sensory sort, which tend to channel through his finger, and he' come to know as Tony).  The family settles in, and things seem to be going well enough until Jack begins to develop writer's block along with a touch of the `cabin fever', and a massive snowstorm settles into the area, further isolating the Torrances from the outside world.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, it seems the hotel had some `unpleasantness' in the past as a previous caretaker also suffered a bout of the winter blues (nowadays we'd call it seasonal affective disorder) and did some very nasty things to his family...and then I should probably also mention that the hotel, which was built in the early 1900's, occupies land that used to be Native American burial grounds, obviously without their permission.I used to read a lot of Stephen King books back in the day, and I've always felt The Shining not only managed to stay pretty close to the source material (keeping and focusing on the important elements), but also reflected much of what made that story so damn scary (the main idea is that psychic activity may not only be inherent in certain individuals, but also places).  Now I know author King disagreed with director Kubrick on a number of things (King wanted someone like Jon Voight or Michael Moriarty instead of Nicholson), but given the thoughtful meticulousness of Kubrick as a director, I'm glad King wasn't able to impress upon Kubrick to alter his vision of how the film should look or play out.  King's a great writer, but his directorial skills leave something to be desired (as displayed in the 1986 bomb Maximum Overdrive, which King took on the directorial reins stating that `If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself'...whatever dude).  The film is filled with wonderful shots featuring interesting angles and unique points of view (the shot with Jack in the freezer, leaning against the door talking to Wendy is inspired) that work amazingly well to foster a sense of claustrophobia in a place that's anything but...some might say the pacing of the film is slow, but I'd characterize it as antagonizing and deliberate, as it takes roughly an hour and 45 minutes before we begin to see the horror appear in more overt forms, specifically Jack becoming more and more unhinged.  This role is characterized as a `signature' role for Nicholson (a role he'll always be known as, much like Voight and the character of Joe Buck or Deniro as Travis Bickle), and while the over the top performances by Nicholson are what gets noticed, watch the quieter scenes for some of the most chilling parts as we see his character desperately struggling to maintain his tenuous grip despite the forces piled against him.  Duvall does an amazing job here, especially the scenes where she has to react as the situation continually deteriorates.  I also thought Danny Lloyd served the film extremely well, helping to create some of the truly shocking and unnerving moments.  Other elements that work so well throughout are the eerie music, the beautiful and elegant sets (the interiors were shot on an English soundstage), and the very realistic dialog featuring many memorable lines.The picture on this DVD is presented in fullscreen format (1.37:1), which is representative of the aspect ratio of the original camera negative as intended by the director, and the sound comes through clearly in Dolby Digital 5.1.  There are a couple of extras including an original theatrical trailer and a making of featurette by Vivian Kubrick with optional commentary.  Is this the most frightening film I've ever seen?  No...that honor would have to go to The Exorcist (1973), but this one is certainly in the top five, and may cause a sleepless night or two.  By the way, make sure you have a couple of hours before watching this film as it runs nearly two and a half hours, but it's worth it as not a single moment is wasted.Cookieman108By the way, does anyone know where I can get some of those lovely, velvety paintings of nekkid, nubile Nubians featured on the walls of Scatman Crothers characters Florida residence?  I'm thinking of sprucing up the old homestead, and they're just what I'm looking for...	5.0	"""Perhaps they need a good...talking-to."""	2005-04-05	15	11	4
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3NESZUVU8697Q	"Cooper ""Coop"""	I love this movie. It is the only horror movie you don't forget anything. If Stephen King doesn't like this version he needs to come here and read these reviews. My husband and I don't really like the new version of the shining. No one can play Jack but Jack Nicholson. When I see him in anything else I still see him as Jack from the shining. I read the book just because of the movie.  I love the original version of this movie. It is one of my favorites. I also really didn't like the new Wendy in the new version. They were too different from the original ones. My only problem is not with the movie itself. It's with Amazon Instant video. I bought this movie so I could have it on my computer and tv without getting the dvd out. I was sorely disappointed when I realized they edited out some scenes that were creepy and one to me is very important to the story. If you had not seen this movie you would not understand what happened. The first scene removed was the scene with the man on the bed and had a person at the foot of the bed in a bear outfit and they both turned and looked at the boy. It't  not important but very creepy knowing there was no one else in the hotel. The second scene which removing it may confuse someone about what happened. It was the scene where the son goes into the room 227 thinking his mother is in the room. They show that part and then they cut out what happens with the woman in the tub. They just show Wendy with Jack and they son walks in the room with the tattered shirt and marks on his neck. This is not the first movie I bought that took out important scenes. The other movie was Land of the Dead. I wish Amazon would let you know when they edit a movie. I would think twice before I buy it that way.

Wow, what a difference!,  Now, the Blu-Ray is out and now the film has taken another giant leap.  It makes the other versions look primitive.On its own - and I'm not a horror movie buff - I found it to be very entertaining and very suspenseful film. Those visuals are so good that I didn't mind the slow pace. Jack Nicholson was perfect for the role. Shelley Duvall was fascinating with her ""Olive Oyl"" face, smile and soft voice. She got panned by a lot of people, and that was unfair. She's fine. The kid (Danny Lloyd) was good, too, as were the supporting players.If you are any kind of a fan of this film, or director Stanley Kubrick's unique style of filmmaking, you owe it to yourself to look at it on this high-definition transfer.  You'll be amazed how great it looks."	5.0	Blu-Ray Edition Really Elevates This Film	2008-11-14	7	6	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3NEYMHYNBZ9PO	craig ganson	This is by far one of Kubricks best pieces of film direction. Jack Nicholson brings to the screen an unforgetable performance as the possesed psycho who is overcome by the spirits that stay in The Overlook Hotel that he decides to look after with his family over the winter peroid. no one else could have played the part any better than Nicholson himself. Watch out for the unforgetable scene where his character eventually begins to snap and the camera slowly zooms in on his face as he glowers out of the window as his family play in the snow or when he smashes his way through the bedroom door with the axe. The original book that the film is adapted from is more complex and carries a lot more detail but Kubrick manages to deal with this problem and condenses the film while still making it enjoyable and make sense. The supporting cast also do a good job and act magnificantly with Nicholson.	5.0	The Shining	2001-07-14	0	0	0

They just don't make horror films like this anymore.  It's very hard to find a film that chills your bones and gets under your skin like The Shining does, and it's equaly hard to find a villian who haunts you long after you've seen the film like Jack does.  Jack Nicholson nailed this performance with conviction and pure insanity, you could really be afraid of this man.  My only complaint it the overly obnoxious acting on the part of Shelley Duvall who played Jack's wife.  She was really annoying.  Danny Lloyd who played the son Danny (it's funny how both Jack and Danny play charactors named Jack and Danny) was frightening.  I rest my case, little kids are creepy as hell.  The whole redrum scene where he's in his mothers room and he's repeating 'redrum' over and over in this demonic voice, I was cringing...It was so nerveracking.  That poor woman...no matter how annoying she was, she had to deal with a crazy husband weilding an ax and a crazy psychic son.  The scene where she locks Jack in the storage room and he's pleading with her to let him out...where he was like ""you hurt my head real bad"" I mean, that was acting genious.  This film proved what people have been saying forever...Jack Nicholson is a freaking legend.  Watch this film.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AWS7LIIU1QFKP	dan	Stanley Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; is a rather disappointing movie.  He took a very good novel by Stephen King, used about ten percent of the actual story, and threw the rest away and made it into a Kubrick movie.  Sure, the novel was weird, but it wsa supernaturally weird, like any other Stephen King book.  But the movie was weird because it was a Kubrick film.  He made it very dark, and twisted, took out all of the greatness of the novel, and gave Nicholson an excuse to run around acting as crazy as he possibly could with an axe in his hands.  Sure, Nicholson was good in it, but I think he's really the only actor in the movie that deserves any credit.  Shelley Duvall just [made me mad].  Why was she in that movie again?  Oh yeah, that's right.  THERE'S NO EXCUSE.  I think she did a horrible job in this movie.  Wendy, Nicholson's wife in the movie, was an excellent character in the book, but in the film, she was just a whimpering, crying idiot.  And Danny Lloyd, what happened to him?  Where did he go? Currently residing in the &quot;Where are they now&quot; files or something? Wow.  Another thing that Kubrick didn't do a very good job on was the character development.  A movie needs good characters, especially a horror movie, and this didn't really get into the characters like the book did.  One thing it almost totally lacks is the relationship between Danny and his father Jack.  In the story, the two are very close, with an undying love for each other, but in the movie, they're just a guy and his son.  Also, the end of the movie and the end of the book are literally different.  The movie had a completely different ending.  In the book, the hotel explodes because Jack forgets to empty the boiler in the basement, another key element of the book that Kubrick for some reason left out.  In the movie, Jack chases his son around in the hedge maze (which isn't even mentioned in the book), lagging as far behind as you can get, which doesn't exactly make the chase at the end exciting.  I wasn't &quot;on the edge of my seat&quot; the whole time.  Kubrick also left out the characters' feelings of total isolation in that icy hell of a hotel in the winter, which added some serious tension to the book, and maybe could've made the film a little better.  But hey, this is just my opinion.  The movie is okay, but I don't really recommend buying it that much.  The first time watching it is good, but for me, after that, it went downhill from there.	3.0	Decent, but...	2001-07-01	4	2	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1SD82ZAT3INZ2	Daniel Hayes	"I remember when I first saw the trailer for this movie in the fall of 1980, and I was only 12 at the time, and I was so horrified with the heavy handed horror on this film. I even went as far as to saying ""The Shining Stinks"" to my classmates. I finally watched it on television in 1986, and I was 19 at the time, and I still had to turn on all the lights in the house as it still gave me the willies. This was however, a teriffic story about a man and his family staying in a hotel high up in the Rockies. The hotel is supposedly haunted, and the man begins his own descent into madness. This film is soooo good you can use it for a Sunday School lesson in which you talk about the young rich ruler who goes to Jesus, and asks what he could do to enter Heaven, and Jesus finally tells him to sell his possessions, and follow him, and the ruler goes away because he didn't want to part with his possessions. You can also use this as a Marriage Counselling tool as there was evidently alot of failure to communicate with the man and his wife. I can see a whole mess of things that this film depicts with the man and his wife. There is however, one flaw where the man fully descends into madness, and tries to murder his family with an ax, and chases his son into a hedge maze, and the wife is running through the hotel, and alot of people become alive, and creatures, or humans wearing animal costumes, and so forth. I still don't know what this was all about, but Kubrick does a good job of balancing those scenes with the chase scenes through the maze. I feel that this is quite possibly the best film ever made. I know the AFA lists ""Citizen Kane"" as the best film ever, but I know this is my all time favorite movie."	5.0	Quite possibly the best film ever made	2008-10-14	5	1	4
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	"The ominous bass chords of Wendy Carlos's keyboards accompany Jack Torrance's white VW Bug going down the highway, with Stanley Kubrick's aerial long shots soaring over lakes, mountains, and the forest.  An interview later, he is given a job to look after the Overlook hotel in Colorado during the off-season (October to 1 May).  However, as Mr. Ullman, the manager says, ""The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is, uh, a tremendous sense of isolation. ... for some people, solitude and isolation can, of itself become a problem.""  He then relates the story of Delbert Grady, a former caretaker who went mad and murdered his family before taking his own life.  No problem, as Jack finds the seven months perfect to write his book while his wife Wendy and their son Danny can do other things.  However, Danny has a talent of recalling past occurrences through Tony, his imaginary friend.The visual imagery is stunning and horrifying.  The one etched in my mind is the ocean of blood pouring out of the elevator doors.  And the Grady twins have got to be among the creepiest movie children I've seen in years.  It's quite a shock to Danny when they appear.  But the design of the hotel itself is a visual feast with its decorations, especially the Gold Room.Stanley Kubrick's usual technique of long range camera shots achieving visual symmetry, e.g. hallway shots with Danny driving his Big Wheel as the center, with the rooms to the doors on either side, is ever present.  Another one is Jack looking at the schematic of the maze, which gradually turns into an aerial view of Wendy and Danny in the maze's center.  But the symmetry also represents the state of Jack's mind.  When he's sane, okay.  When he goes over the edge,...Yet one criticism I have is the effectiveness of the captions indicating the elapsed time.  Despite the fact a month passed, I came away with the impression that Jack suddenly goes crazy instead of something that gradually happens.  It's more effective later on, but that initial transition could've been better handled.And chalk up yet another role that deserved at least a Best Actor nomination for Jack Nicholson.  From the genial family man to a demon wracked by the murderous rage, his facial expressions.  A line from the MAD magazine's satire of this movie, The Shiner, is apropos.  Remember how he did one called One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest?... Well, he's still flying.  The well-famous still of his manically-grinning grizzled face framed against the door he's chopped away is one of cinema's indelible images.  And Shelley Duvall adds to the credibility as Wendy.  Her wide eyes effectively realizes the horror she feels as her husband tries to ""correct her.""  A definite contrast to her Olive Oyl from Popeye, also released in 1980.  While Danny Lloyd does a credible job as Danny, he loses big in having a cheesy pudding bowl haircut that was big in the 1970's.Kubrick was one of those directors who was not tied down to genre but explored different ones, be it sexual obsession (Lolita, Eyes Wide Shut), Cold War satire (Dr. Strangelove), science fiction (2001), near-future dystopias (Clockwork Orange), and the follies of war (Paths Of Glory, Full Metal Jacket).  With The Shining, he effectively added psychological horror to his small but potent resume.Closing comments:  All review and no play make Daniel a dull reviewer.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A27CFNHYZG6WS8	darragh o'donoghue	Kubrick's best films have always, thematically, had much in common with horror films - e.g. the mental and physical decline of confident male heroes; the intrusion of the past on the present; the preference for cavernous interiors - so it is surprising people found his choice to make 'The Shining' an odd one.  It is only odd if you define the term horror within limited boundaries - a formulaic narrative in which everything is reduced to sensation.Kubrick parodies these boundaries by throwing in every old horror cliche as 'explanation' for the events in the Overlook Hotel (e.g. horrific crime committed there in the past; built on Indian burial grave; the horror narrative as a sublimated account of Jack's marriage, fear of aging etc.).  All these threads are plausible, and do what the horror film has always done - created a mythic or symbolic space where crises, fears, anxieties, repressions etc. are played out, and normality is in some manner restored.And 'Shining' is deeply satisfying on all these levels: it is, for instance, the best metaphor for marriage since Beckett's 'Happy Days', a heightening of a very real situation - two people forced to spend all their time together, wearing each other down, making each other feel small until the only release is in violence, child abuse, murder etc.  This is a condition for millions of couples around the world, Duvall's voice only a little more grating, Nicholson only a little more mad than the norm.The film can also be seen as an allegory for America's past, the spirits of African slaves and massacred Indians come back to haunt a nation on the brink of the Reagan years.  it is a film about what happens to man when this Indian period, the Western, is over, and he must turn inwards, must domesticate himself, become female (Jack is a caretaker, his job is to look after a house).  And it is a film about creative failure, writer's block, where inspiration flows everywhere except that white page.'Shining' could be about all these things and stay within the confines of the horror film.  Kubrick, of course, has never been interested in confines, and 'Shining' plays as the third film in a trilogy that includes '2001' and 'Barry Lyndon', culminating one of the major achievements in the cinema.  As in those films, Kubrick moves beyond mere genre by displacing narrative, with its linear move towards crisis and resolution.  Instead of the past returning to haunt the future, the past, present and future co-exist in a temporal labyrinth, which is reflected in a narrative labyrinth composed of 'reality', dreams, visions, flashbacks, flashforwards etc., with each narrative development repeated or foreshadowed in an endless loop, and physically reflected in the garden maze, whose walls seem to move with Kubrick's camera, and whose model Jack peers over, like a God, or a writer who's just got an idea for a book.As in '2001' and 'Lyndon', Kubrick conflates time and space in 'Shining', so when Jack walks physically in space, he is also walking through time.  'Shining' often feels like '2001', those endless Steadicam shots like voyages through vast, empty, unpopulated space - the film's opening, with its chillingly articulate officials and large lobby hint at a terrifying voyage ahead.  The use of architectural space and the collapse of narrative into dream logic, with the hero forced to confront his various selves in one time, also echo that film.Like '2001', 'Shining' is unexpectedly, blackly comic, yet also curiously moving - the Gold Room sequences are among the most resonant in all cinema.  The pay-off is unparalelled and devastating.  Confines indeed.	5.0	The third in Kubrick's major Time and Space trilogy.	2001-09-13	6	4	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1K9ES7D1I1X4H	Datus	No plot development.  No character development.  Just Jack Nicholson doing his same old, gimmicky acting which I find no charm in as it's always superfluous. Also, the music in the film overshadows every scene.  Scenes that aren't even the slightest bit suspenseful are scored with intense music.  To make things worse the camera angles are way off.  For instance, Jack rips a piece of paper from his typewriter, some intense music comes in, but the shot is taken from so far away that it leaves no impact at all.  The film is littered with this sort of aimless direction.You learn nothing about the hotel.  You learn nothing about the characters.  Right from the beginning the movie attempts to be this sort of house-of-horrors but falls way short of that goal because you're not lead into it guessing. Right from chapter one, during the interview the Hotel administration - not acting as they should in a normal interview - come right out and state that people kill themselves who stay here, and they go into graphic detail and Nicholson is already doing his little crazy person talent show act.  I mean it's a total joke.Short of the attention-to-sound which is Kubricks only talent - scenes where the kid is riding around on his 3 wheel, and hits a sequence of hardwood then carpets, was probably the only creative idea in this film.I think only Nicholson fans like this movie, and there are many.  Hence the incredibly high ratings this movie gets.  Based on these ratings you would almost think it was as good as The Godfather, yet in reality this movie is not even as good as Earnest Goes To Camp.	1.0	A total loss	2008-05-25	15	3	12

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"""The Shining"" was an interesting choice for director Stanley Kubrick to tackle.  Generally, when you think of Kubrick's choices they deal with larger themes and you would not think that he would engage himself in a discredited genre such as horror.  When this film was released in 1980 to lukewarm critical and audience reaction, some feel he didn't engage himself in it very well.  What is this film? Is it horror? Is it dark comedy? A hybrid of both? To my mind, whatever it is or whatever Kubrick intended it to be it works.  The movie is about Jack Torrance(Jack Nicholson), a blocked writer, who takes a job as a caretaker at an isolated mountain resort for the winter with his wife, Wendy(Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny(Danny Lloyd) in tow.  As the onset of winter presents itself, the pressures mount on Jack and he starts to slowly go beserk by seeing things real or imagined and decides to turn on his family.  Now, alot of people point out that Nicholson telegraphed his insanity early in the film by playing his character broadly from the get go.  But considering the demands that Kubrick put on his actors I believe this was purely intentional.  Duvall also gives a frenzied performance, but legend has it that she was a sensitive soul who cracked under the pressure that Kubrick exerted.  The Overlook hotel set also works as a character in the film, with it's long hallways and cavernous rooms used to terrific effect.  The snow-covered exteriors and in particular the hedge maze that was created for the film enhance the horror.  Stephen King was on record as saying that he despised this film, that Kubrick gutted his novel.  He so disliked this film that he approved a made-for-television adaptation that stuck more closely to his book.  I've read ""The Shining"" and found it more silly than scary.  I think this film has held up remarkably well and that Kubrick made the correct choices."	5.0	Kubrick Tackles Horror	2004-10-08	11	9	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3QY9AN12M8P8N	"David B. Jaromnak ""djaromnak"""	Alright, this film version of the best selling Stephen King novel is not very faithful to the book, however, it has Jack Nicholson, who gives an over-the-top performance that makes this film five stars.  Stephen King was so unhappy with the interpretation, that he later made a made-for-TV remake with Stephen Weber and Rebecca de Mornay years later.  Comparing the two, both have their moments and stronger points.  The centerpiece of this version is the writer Jack Torrence played by Nicholson and of course, the beautiful Overlook Hotel and its scenary. Slowly Nicholson succumbs to Cabin Fever and with this &#34;shining&#34; ability, is seduced by the hotel management to do some terrible deeds.  The most outlandish scene is Jack and Wendy on the stairs with the bat, which is brilliant.  Instead of animal topiary and the evil playground, we get the hedge maze. The animals were better.  The final scenes are truly scary stuff with Wendy walking through the cobwebed halls, skeletons, and a river of blood.  Classic horror from the master directoy Stanley Kubrick.  I highly recommend all of Kubrick's films, and this is no exception.  This review is on the now discontinued HD DVD standard by Toshiba.  It is a shame this format died off ,as it is just as clear as Blu Ray, but lost the format war to Sony.  In this HD DVD transfer, the image quality is absolutely breathtaking.  The actors stand out on the screen.  When Wendy is smoking a cigarette, the smoke and embers looks entirely real!

Nicholson's performance is way over the top, as is Duvall's, and the soundtrack becomes overwhelming by the end of the film.  Yet it all seems to work, raising the horror of the situation to operatic heights.  Director Stanley Kubrick knows how to frame and light a shot so that the desolation and chill of the environment seeps right off the screen.  Perhaps it is the basic horror of the situation that affects me so strongly.  The nuclear family should be the last bastion of trust and security, yet here we have a man stalking his family with an ax through the dim, deserted corridors of the cavernous hotel.  The final shot is intriguing and frustrating and made me wish that Kubrick had found a way to include more backstory about the Overlook.	5.0	Horrifying (in a good way)	2003-05-30	1	0	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A15KVNFOLDB904	"David Brimer ""David Brimer"""	By 1980, we knew that Stanley Kubrick could make movies. He revolutionized the genre with his classics 2001, a clockwork orange, and Barry Lyndon, and The shining is no exception. The first Kubrick I saw, the shining really terrifys. Yet, the movie would not be the same without Jack Nicholson. His face is the most terrifying thing in the entire film. The way we notice his gradual decline into insanity will send shivers through the bones.The shining has many scenes that will make you jump. Of course The crucial scene (heeres Johnny!) when Jack Torrence breaks his way into Wendy's room is terrifying on all levels. First, Kubrick's camera work is steller. the way the camera follows the axe is unmatched, and truely adds to the terror. Second is the pure fear the graces shelly Duvall's face, and of course third, Jack's imfamous insane grin.Some may find that The shining is slow, but those who can appreciate the way Kubrick makes movie's, will be enthralled by the set's, the camera movements, and the superb acting. Yet, the ending of the movie could be the most horrible, terrifying thirty minutes in film history, it still sends shutters down my spine.Kubrick was a Genius, is a Genius, will always be a Genius	5.0	the most terrifying film experience	2003-08-10	2	1	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3GKOMCQTTWPUI	"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL"""	"When critics appraise director Stanley Kubrick's extended output, they most often count ""The Shining"" as the odd duck, the one that never made it, the one that didn't live up to the great man's reputation. In fact, the film has been something of an embarrassment for Kubrick aficionados. Even his final effort, ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" got better notices than ""The Shining.""Yet ""The Shining"" remains one of Kubrick's most popular pictures, the movie most non-Kubrick fans enjoy the most. Is this to suggest the director was purposely aiming his film at a lowbrow audience? I hope not. I'm a Kubrick fan, I appreciate his other work, and I love this film, too. Well, admittedly, I'm pretty lowbrow. Taken for what it is, an extremely well-made horror flick with a typically ambiguous Kubrick theme about the lingering effects of evil, ""The Shining"" stands head and shoulders over most of its competition. Now digitally restored and all the better to appreciate, this new version of the 1980 film makes its second DVD appearance within a year. It is part of a remastered series from Warner Bros. that includes ""Lolita,"" ""2001,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Barry Lyndon,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" all offered individually or as part of a boxed set of nine discs that also contains Columbia TriStar's ""Dr. Strangelove"" and an excellent documentary on Kubrick, ""A Life in Pictures.It's one of the few horror films that can still give me chills the fifth and sixth times around and make my hair stand on end.Based on the novel by Stephen King, ""The Shining"" tells the story of a former alcoholic (Jack Nicholson) who takes his wife (Shelley Duvall) and five-year-old son (Danny Lloyd) to spend a winter as caretakers of an old, rambling, isolated hotel in the mountains. The conflict? The hotel is haunted by the ghosts of past atrocities, including the ax murder by a previous caretaker of his entire family. And the young son happens to be psychic, which adds to the dilemma; he is said to have ""the shining,"" the ability to read the future and talk to spirits. Before you can say ""Boo,"" the child is seeing all kinds of weird stuff, like the bloodied corpses of twin girls who were murdered at the hotel. Combine these spooky goings-on with the boy's well-founded fear of his father, who hurt him earlier in an alcoholic rage, and we know the poor kid is not exactly in for a pleasant winter vacation. As we suspect, it doesn't take long before old Jack starts to crack under the strain of solitude, ""cabin fever"" it's sometimes called, seeing ghosts, turning into an ax-wielding monster, and tearing after his wife and son.Whatever its critics have said, I believe the film succeeds on almost every level. The first hour is appropriate introduction and exposition. It builds a mood of quiet tension. We can readily see there is something just a little wrong with the father, but we can't yet pin it down. By the second hour, all hell breaks loose, and in the last few minutes it's sheer terror. It's one of the few horror films that can still give me chills the fifth and sixth times around and make my hair stand on end.Over the years I've heard ""The Shining"" faulted on three major counts: It goes on too long, the director is too constrained, and Nicholson is out of control. Let's take these items one at a time. First, is it really too long? Well, there is hardly a scene that could be deleted. Maybe the interview toward the beginning between the boy and the social-worker psychologist could have been dropped or shortened. Anything else? Nothing I can think of. Kubrick is a filmmaker who tells his stories largely through imagery, so naturally there are going to be long, lingering mood shots. It's a beautiful motion picture to look at, whether it's for the glorious outdoor scenery or the equally impressive indoors of the grand hotel. It may be the most good-looking horror movie ever made, and I love those long tracking shots through the hallways. The hotel itself is made to become a dynamic persona in the drama. Besides, Kubrick did later cut the film for television, and it only made it worse.Second, is the director really too distant, too aloof from his characters? Again, I think not. Like E.A. Poe, Kubrick uses his characters to carry out his story line; they exist as vehicles to create an effect rather than as three-dimensional human beings in and of themselves. Not that we don't feel for the wife and child and their predicament; indeed, we come to careabout them very much by the end of the film. It's just that their personalities are not as important as what they're experiencing.Finally, is Nicholson truly unrestrained? Much has been said of the apparent conflict between the ever-cool, ever-calculating director and the volatile actor, most criticism suggesting that Nicholson had more input than he should have had and was allowed to go over the top. The DVD's accompanying documentary, however, made during the film's shooting, refutes the argument. One sequence shows Kubrick telling Nicholson they will have to re-shoot a scene (Kubrick was notoriously exacting and would re-shoot scenes more times than most directors would have the patience or budget for) because Nicholson isn't acting ""mean"" enough! I'm convinced that most of what Nicholson did in the film was written, suggested, or encouraged by the director. The upshot, in any case, is a tour-de-force acting job. ""Heeere's Johnny!"" As much as for any of his many fine film roles, it may be for this performance that Nicholson is best remembered.Video:Although I liked the film the first time around on DVD, I had wished the picture quality was better. On the first disc, the image was only so-so at best, sometimes less. The transfer was clearly not made from as pristine a print as we could have hoped for, because age spots and grain were quite noticeable, especially in the beginning of each reel. With this new digitally restored and remastered edition, the video quality is greatly improved. It still isn't perfect, but the focus is sharpened, some of the more ragged edges are smoothed out, and much of the grain and most of the age spots are eliminated. Some flickering lines and some grittiness remain (especially in the opening sequence), but, overall, this is a substantial improvement over the film's first transfer to disc. The film is presented in a standard-screen, 1.33:1 aspect ratio, said to be the full-frame photography from which the theatrical widescreen version was later matted. Warner Bros. state on the box that the film is ""in the full aspect ratio of the original camera negative, as Stanley Kubrick intended."" The image is high, wide, and deep, quite a bit more so than I had remembered from its initial widescreen theatrical release.Audio:The other major improvement is in the sound. The first DVD rendering of the audio provided only a monaural soundtrack. Now, we get a remixed Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 track, rendering all the better the atmospheric music Kubrick chose to accompany the story--Bartok's ""Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta,"" for instance, and selections from Hector Berlioz, Wendy Carlos, Gyorgy Ligeti, and Krzysztof Penderecki. Since most of the excerpts Kubrick used were taken from commercially available stereo recordings (the Bartok is a von Karajan DG performance, for example), the remix is really from two-channel sources opened up to five. The results are far from spectacular, and they are still accompanied by some tape hiss and noise, but they are a decided improvement on the previous mono.Extras:The primary bonus item remains the behind-the-scenes documentary, ""The Making of the Shining,"" about thirty-five minutes long. It was shot by the director's daughter, Vivian Kubrick, much like a home movie during the feature film's production and includes interviews with cast and crew, and a good deal of inside information. Warner provide the same, generous forty scene selections and trailer as before, but now they include French in addition to English as a language choice and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Of course, if you buy the gift box, you also get the Kubrick documentary disc, ""A Life in Pictures,"" almost two-and-a-half hours long and telling us practically everything we ever wanted to know about the director, his movies, his motivations, and his themes. It's narrated by Tom Cruise and features interviews and commentary with Woody Allen, Arthur C. Clarke, Keir Dullea, Shelley Duvall, Nicole Kidman, Malcolm McDowell, Paul Mazursky, Jack Nickolson, Sydney Pollack, Martin Scorsese, Richard Schickel, Steven Spielberg, Peter Ustinov, and many more. Extensive film clips from Kubrick's films and from private sources take us behind the movies and into the soul of the man who made such unique films. Much of the documentary goes over material we already know, but much of it is new and fascinating, too. No Kubrick fan should be without it.Parting Thoughts:Supposedly, Stephen King hated Kubrick's interpretation of his book so much that in 1997 he wrote his own screenplay for a television miniseries. The result was a long, tedious, non-frightening experience that only proved how taut and well constructed Kubrick's treatment was. ""The Shining"" is a damn fine scary film, made all the better in its new DVD restoration. And remember, ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play....."""	5.0	All Work and No Play...	2005-11-29	12	8	4
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A34IBXM7E8CPWE	David Girod	I've read King's original novel, and I've seen Kubrick's film several times...but it's been awhile since I've done either. Last week I went back and re-read King's original tale, and fell in love with it all over again. Just a creepy, wonderful story. This past weekend I re-watched Kubrick's film, and I can understand why King doesn't really care for it.Let me state right up front, that I really enjoy this movie. It's a beautifully shot film; amazing camerwork, a hauntingly unforgettable score, and some fantastic performances. I think the biggest problem with this movie, is also it's biggest asset, and that's Jack Nicholson.The character of Jack Torrance in the novel strives to be a loving father, he's truly struggling with his sobriety, and you see that he's really hoping that the caretaker's job will give he and his family the second chance that they desperately need. In the novel Jack Torrance loves Wendy, and he's doing everything he can to save his marriage.Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance seems to hate his wife from the get-go. On the way to The Overlook hotel, he's already lost his patience with both Wendy and Danny, you get the feeling that this Jack Torrance hates being a family man. You don't feel that Torrance regrets hurting Danny, and you just know that, Overlook or not, this Jack Torrance would be hitting the bottle again.There really isn't much of a character arc for the movie version of Jack Torrance as he slides from irritation to outright lunacy almost as soon as the first snowflakes fall.What really stood out to me on this viewing was what a wonderful performance Shelley Duvall put in as Wendy. As the movie opens you see that she's battled for her family, she is hanging onto threads to try and keep her family together, and once they are in the Overlook, and Jack starts his lunacy, her performance gets amped up. I think that Duvall's performance gets buried under everything Jack Nicholson is doing (and how could it not?), but the next time you watch this, pay to attention to Wendy. Her character arc his much more compelling, and I think Duvall adds so much to the film, and to the character of Wendy, as it's much better than what King gave to Wendy.Danny Lloyd as young Danny Torrance carries a lot of the film on his shoulders, and he is really, really good. If you've ever seen the unfortunate TV mini-series of &#34;The Shining&#34;, you can see just how crucial the character of Danny is to the tale, and if the role is miscast, the story can't be salvaged. Lloyd carries his scenes, and plays off of Duvall and Scatman Crothers really well. His few scenes with Nicholson are secondary as Nicholson is kind of doing his own thing, and you kind of forget who or what else is in the room.The movie, and Nicholson's performance is iconic. If you grew up in the 70's and 80's, then &#34;The Shining&#34; stands with &#34;Halloween&#34;, &#34;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#34; and &#34;Alien&#34; as on of the building blocks of modern horror. Again, it's a beautiful film, and so well shot, you should watch it just to see see Kubrick at the top of his game.If you're only familiar with the film, then make sure you pick up King's novel. It parallels the film in some ways, but it's a drastically different take. With the novel, you get the feeling that the Overlook is haunted, where the film feels more a film a man's slide into insanity.	5.0	I Can See King's Point	2014-05-05	0	0	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3MA0EU5PGAPJ8	David	I love how meticulous this director was in making this film. Some say there's even a Apollo 11 Moon Landing hoax filming cover-up conspiricy laced throughout the film, representing Kubrick's lament, shame and horror that he had helped the American government cover up the &#34;fact&#34; that they had deceived the American public and the world. I'm not sure about it's accuracy, but hey, still fun to consider. You be the judge. See how many things you can find in the film that may have to do with the Apollo 11 mission.	5.0	One of Kubrick's Masterpieces	2013-10-07	0	0	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1A39PCVKL0X2M	David Lorell Hoskins	Every once in a while, I get this need to watch The Shining again. And not just watch it, but get obsessed by it, researching more about its cast and the making of. Up until now, I've just rented it again and again (and again). After each obsessive episode, I always think I've had my fill of The Shining and am over it for good. I've finally learned. Though I haven't felt the need to watch it again since my last viewing after my purchase, it will come tapping soon enough, at least by October if not before then.PS - I think Shelly Duvall's performance as Wendy Torrance is the soul of this film. She appears to have worked the hardest of the cast and sacrificed the most. Imagine the mental stress of repeated takes of those emotionally draining scenes. She allowed Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance to bloom so magnificently. Love both actors. I just think Shelly deserves a bit more recognition than she's so far received.	5.0	Finally got smart and purchased this movie	2013-07-13	1	1	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A39L5T2ZQZ52FN	David Michael Cohen	Let's get one thing straight, the Kubrick film is not, repeat, is not the book. It is a re-invention of the theme under the same title. That being said, let's cut the whining about how different it is from the book and try to judge the film on its own merits.The movie held my attention from start to finish, and geuniunely scared me at parts. Much has been made of the characters, so let's review them. First, there is Jack, a man who was apparently never very stable and, once placed in relative isolation in a haunted hotel, goes completely crazy. This is consistent with the character's history as explained in the film. His &quot;recovery&quot; after breaking his son's arm was apparently only a thin shell that he developed to hide his abberation. As a side note, this is consistent with the Jack in the book, who never sought outside help to help him control his drinking (unlike the miniseries, the first 20 minutes or so of which seemed like Jack doing a commercial for AA). In this film (and in the book) Jack's erratic nature was invisible to his family because they loved him blindly. Shelly Duval's character appears to be just the kind of person who could love a person so blindly, so she gets five stars too.Danny's performance in the movie is also widely criticized as over the top, especially with regards to the &quot;redrum&quot; sequence. Let's not forget, however, that he is a child and something unworldly is happening to him. What do you expect, calm acceptance of his situation? I doubt that even an adult could manage that in his situation. Furthermore, the Tony in the film was largely unseen, like the Tony in the book, which enhanced the effect of &quot;his&quot; role greatly. This is in contrast to the Tony of the miniseries, who hovered above Danny and preached like some cheesy b-movie angel.A lot is made about the elements of the book that were excluded. The things that were lost, however, really made little difference to the plot. The hornet's nest sequence served only to highlight Jack's inadequacy as an exterminator  The topiaries were not missed as they were probably the silliest part of the book (when I read that part remember thinking &quot;what is this, 'Day of the Triffids' all of a sudden?&quot;). The hedge maze was a place of fun turned into a trap that required paradoxial thinking (i.e. walking backwards) to foil. This was consistent with the tone of the movie and enhanced it greatly.Again., I urge viewers to watch this movie with an open mind. Don't criticize it just because it is different from the book. Instead, try to appreciate the creepy atmosphere, shockig visuals and excellent performances.	5.0	Liked the book, and this movie	2002-01-03	2	2	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A176XPHAQEOKUI	David Staples	There aren't that many things wrong with this movie...although the fact that they're incredibly bad things makes up for the lack of quantity.I won't get into the DVD aspect of it, because frankly I haven't seen it,  and judging from some of the other reviews here it's pretty horrible.First of all; the casting. Jack Nicholson played a great part...although  his character didn't stay true to the book. You couldn't believe that he  was a recovering alcoholic trying to keep his marriage together for the  sake of his son (as in the book). Why did he try to kill his wife? Well  after seeing Shelly Duvall's performance, I can see why.She was a  snivelling, absolutely horrible actress. She was nothing like the Wendy  that graced the pages of one of Stephen King's best novels. From the very  beginning I actually WANTED Jack to kill her.That little kid that  played Danny...I don't know his name...he was a GOOD actor...probably the  best in the entire movie.Unfortunately, when it comes to staying true  to the book, the movie veered as far off course as the Exxon Valdez. And it  ran right into the same shallow water.The ending was horrible. The  maze scenes weren't even IN the novel. The only part that I was impressed  with was when Danny was riding along on his Big Wheel through the  hotel.Anyone who says that this is the best horror movie of all time  has to give themselves an &quot;I'm An Idiot&quot; sticker, glue it to  their foreheads (because god knows they won't be able to figure out how to  peel the backing off) and read the original novel.Or, barring that,  see if you can find the 3-part miniseries ABC aired a year or so ago.  Everything about it was much better than this, one of Stanley Kubrick's  worst movies.	1.0	Sadly disappointing adaption.	2000-01-06	31	13	18
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3E3H54FAX08ZH	David V. Matthews	I notice that the deluxe DVD for this movie has the shorter, widescreen version, instead of the longer and/or full-screen version.  Kubrick shot his last three films in full-screen, apparently his preferred format, so why not release that version along with the widescreen in one set?  And I know he shortened the movie for its British release, but why not relelease the longer one?

NOT long after,  I seen the film and thought it was GREAT, it was also my first introduction to Jack Nicholson. I don't think ANYONE could have played ""Jack Torrance"" better than Jack, It's been said that Jack's performance took away from the main character (The Hotel) but that is rediculous....Nicholson MADE this movie what it is. He goes from being a normal ""Hard on his luck"" type of guy, and you see him being pushed to the point of madness. I liked how his look as time went on began to change. There are SO MANY classic parts in this movie, like the part as Danny and Wendy are out playing in the snow and we see Jack just standing there in a trance, THAT is SCARY, almost bothersome., The part where Wendy tells Jack they need to leave the hotel after Jack just encountered the crazy lady in 237, He goes from calm to boiling hot in 2 seconds. The infamous confrontation Wendy and Jack have while she's holding the bat walking backwards, and how about when she locks Jack in the food storage??? His performance is SO good (""Go check it out...."") This movie made me a huge Jack Nicholson fan and I love all his movies but THIS one in particular stands as his absolute BEST, at least for me. NOT really sure how there can be ANY negative reviews.....I've seen this movie litterally over 50 times and everytime it is like watching for the first time, I LOVE IT!!! Have to give a hats off to Shelly Duvall as Wendy, she comes across as so believeable and you begin to feel sorry for her and what she is going thru. All in ALL, I am esstatic over the 2 disc special edition this movie is getting, I bought the last one as well from a few years ago, and I'll buy the 30th aniversary and the 35th and so on.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A26N8RCL0U07PH	Dennis Rowland	First of all, i must state quite simply; this is probably the greatest most epic horror movie EVER. I have never been more scared during a movie then I was during this. Sorry, but halloween, Jason, Freddy, and all their  clones just dont frighten me. This is TRUE horror, suspense at it's  greatest. It is IMHO Nicholson's greatest performance, he is PERFECT. And  the set design is UNBELIEVABLE!  Ok, now for all you people who think  this movie doesn't compare to the book or whatever, first off the bat, the  book hardly scared me, if anything i thought King's book was cheesy. This  movie frightened me and put me in a state of awe that the book couldn't  touch. OK, this movie was not supposed to be exactly like the book. If it  was, King would have written the screenplay. He didn't, Kubrick wrote the  screenplay. They are very different in their morals and in their beliefs of  human nature. This movie is more realistic then the book. And yes, even at  the beginning of the movie Jack is supposed to have that glimmer of  insanity, he is an unstable person recovering from alcoholism. BUT he is  still a good father and husband.There are so many themes I could touch on,  but I won't even bother. Just know that this is a completely different  entity then King's 'masterpiece', as all you people call it (haha).It is  much superior. Kubrick truely is a genius.....	5.0	this goes out to all you 'fans' of the book!	2000-07-30	2	1	1

Not just a high-grade classic in its own right, but practically the &#8220;go to&#8221; option when all other plans fail.  This is the &#8220;necessary evil&#8221; for all horror and suspense fans to keep handy when the weather gets bad, or cable programming is terrible, or when you&#8217;re just plain bored and feel like delivery food and a blanket.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AFTEDMW813PAW	D. Gorman  &#34;Crystalline Structure Moon&#34;	Without Jack Nicholson, this so-so movie wouldn't be worth the effort.  But Jack really shines through (as he often does) and makes this flick almost work.  The script and storyline fall short of representing this great Stephen King novel.  The true explanation of what is happening is never given in the movie.  You're left wondering what the whole thing was about.  Scatman Crothers was a wonderful choice in the role of Halloran, the cook who tells Danny about 'the shining'.  The boy who played Danny did a good job as the kid.  Shelley Duvall is supurb at acting scared, but otherwise fails to carry the role of Jack's wife Wendy.  For the most part, the acting, script, pacing and overall effect fell short of its target.  Too many short cuts were taken, such as having a hedge maze instead of hedge animals, and the cheesy ending that was cheaper to shoot than it would have been if they had ended the movie properly according to the novel.  Decent special effects...occasionally almost scary.  Jack Nicholson does a great job of saving this movie, but there is such a drag factor in so many of the movie's downfalls, it's still only worth 3 stars.  If you're a big Jack N. fan, get it.  Otherwise, I can't highly recommend this so-so flick.	3.0	Jack Nicholson makes this inadequate adaptation of a great S. King novel worth watching	2008-05-29	3	1	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3MCC5MAJYJYMD	Dhaval Vyas	"Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', judging by its cult reputation over the years, and its high rating on this website, has become a classic. It has gained a notorious reputation among film lovers. It was horror movie made by Stanley Kubrick, a director who arguably has had greater polarization than any other filmmaker in history. It has a legendary performance by the legendary Jack Nicholson. It has several scenes that have scared the crap out of people, most notably the 'river of blood' sequence. Does 'The Shining' deserve the reputation that it gets, or is it yet another confusing Kubrick film that is overrated?The story is loosely based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. It is about a family of three who have to take care of an expensive hotel for the winter. Jack Torrence (Nicholson) is a struggling writer who is the main caretaker. His wife and his son accompany him for the winter stay. What happens during their stay is a series of terrifying events that leads to a tragic conclusion. What is most interesting about 'The Shining' is that it horror film that not like most other horror films. It follows a formula of creating tension, rather that blood and gore. Although there is violence in the film, it is not as explicit or gory as other horror movies. This is a good thing and it is not surprising that Kubrick followed this formula.Kubrick, once again, shows his masterful craftsmanship for film-making. The lighting, editing, and overall technique is unparalleled. It can be argued that no other filmmaker could shoot a film as well as Kubrick did. But at the same time, this mastery is his greatest flaw. What he mastered in the technical side, he gave up in storytelling, character, and logic. 'The Shining' is often goofy and silly, rather than tense and frightening. It is very slow and many scenes and unnecessarily long. Two superstars exist in the film. One is Stanley Kubrick.The other is Jack Nicholson. Nicholson gives one of his most memorable performance as a writer who goes mad at his stay in the hotel. His acting is really over-the-top, but Nicholson is such a supreme actor, we do not care because it is Jack Nicholson. Actors do not get any larger than him. Near the end of the film, when he confronts his wife by his typewriter, is absolutely awesome film-making. Nicholson is at his most brilliant. The other people in the film are simply annoying. Shelly Duvall is so annoying playing his wife, it is no wonder Jack wants to ""bash her brains in"". Danny, Jack's son, is equally annoying. I believe child actors should play a very minimal role in adult films. Minimal meaning they should only say a few lines and take up no more than 10 minutes. I understand Danny is at the center of the film, but do most people really think children have the maturity and ability to be in films like these?Another thing that is annoying about 'The Shining' is its change of subject matter. A film that begins exploring themes of alcoholism and child abuse, slowly turns into yet another silly horror movie. Yet another typical horror movie with the madman with the ax and the screaming woman. One major thing does not make any sense. When Wendy discovers what Jack has been writing for months on end, it has a logical flaw. It suggests Jack has been crazy since the first day he stepped into the hotel, and that he did not go insane over time. Why on Earth would he be crazy from the beginning and why did his family not notice? Should we be asking these deep questions because it is yet another horror movie, or should be ask them because it is a Kubrick film? This is the frustration many people feel after they have finished watching a Kubrick film. It isn't that they don't ""get it"", they just don't get what all the fuss was about."	2.0	A Well made film that does not make any sense.	2001-12-28	7	4	3

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A7LXWJYEKPQTT	D. J. Richardson	"In my opinion, this is the best ""horror"" film ever made.  However, it is not the conventional horror flick, full of blood guts and gore - and that is why its the best, really.  The directing is superb.  Kubrick is a genius who has no equal.  Every shot of every scene is labored to perfection, like all his movies.  The scares are not shallow make-you-jump scares... they are intense scenes of creepiness that invade your mind, forcing you to think and feel in ways you never want to, but follow nevertheless, out of curiousity and intrigue.  This is the genius of it all.  The best scary movies are not repulsive, they want you to look, to explore, but all the while you ask yourself, why am I following?  No other director can take a script with very little violence (for a horror movie) and very little real action (for a thriller) and deliver the goods almost on the look and feel alone.Kubrick knows how to scare, he knows what fear really is and he knows how to pick a soundtrack.  This music is downright chilling.  This is a movie I saw for the first time well over ten years ago and ever since certain scenes have never left me... the twins standing in the hallway, Wendy sitting in the bathroom screaming in sheer terror as Jack tears the door down, and room 237.  Who would have thought a scary movie could be made with good acting?  I am not a fan of horror, really, so I dont have a vast knowledge of films made in this genre, but the only other horror film I can think of with real, quality acting was the original Exorcist - another classic.This is not a movie of cheap thrills.  This is a study of the psyche, an exploration of fear itself.  What terrifies people?  I think Kubrick wanted to get to the heart of true terror by answering that question.  Terror is not an ugly monster and blood and guts.  Terror is the darkness of the mind... the fear of the unknown... it is the loss of stability... the loss of love and familiarity... it is betrayal... vulnerablitly, hoplessness, it is The Shining - which incorporates all of these emotions."	5.0	"My favorite ""horror"" film of all time"	2005-03-10	5	3	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AVCRD98TH48RN	D. Knouse	"The title of my review once haunted my fragile childhood like no other phrase.  I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13, and sharing the same name as the boy in the film, it is little wonder why this movie scared the life out of me!  The style of the film, with its minimalistic use of music and the cinematographer's use of wide-angle shots to give a sense of open space, make for an interesting experience.  Not to mention this movie has ""Jack.""  I once heard that Stephen King hated this rendition of his popular novel, but I think that the story is more visceral and terrifying without the overdose of the supernatural that his novel is prone to.  This film is a ghost story by film's end, but a journey into madness along the way. There are some over-the-top moments meant to invoke terror.  Like the ""Here's Johnny!"" scene, or when Danny is riding through the halls on his big-wheel and turns a corner to find twin girls staring at him and chanting, ""Come and play with us, Danny.  You can play with us forever...and ever...and ever...""  But some are simply too much to swallow.  Like Shelley Duvall running through the hotel looking for her son and encountering all the hauntings.  Of those scenes, only one works.  It's the scene when the elevator opens in slow-motion and blood flows from the compartment filling the hallway.  Anyway, if you love Jack, then this movie is essential viewing.  An interesting side-note: I watched this film again recently and I found myself looking at the film from Jack's perspective instead of the little boy's.  I found that to be equally unsettling.  Overall, this is very creepy, and a worthy edition to any Horror film collection."	4.0	"""Danny!  I'm comin' to get you Danny!"""	2004-03-10	2	1	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	This movie, while being a film from the great Stanley Kubrick, is nothing short of horrible. While containing small aspects of what the book wished to convey, there is nothing believable about this movie, unlike the totally  engrossing novel. This movie tends more to concentrate on the effects of  blood and gore, showing scenes of two little girls' chopped up bodies, Jack  sinking an axe into Halloran's heart (VERY GRAPHIC), and a possessed Danny  who talks to his finger in a voice that seems to come straight from the  catacombs of hell. Maybe that is what Mr. Kubrick wished to convey, but it  certainly does not do justice to the brilliant novel. Even the room that  Danny is warned about, Room 217 in the book, is changed to 237 in the  movie. WHY? And what is with that stupid maze thing in the garden? It makes  no sense to me. This movie as a whole doesn't make sense, but then we soon  forget that Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut, made no sense either. This  is not a movie for fans of the novel, and if you want a movie that follows  the novel, then try to find the 1997 miniseries starring Rebecca de Mornay  and Steven Weber. That's the best.	1.0	Horrendous.	2000-03-03	27	12	15

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A11PTCZ2FM2547	"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	Shelley Duvall is just plain weird, and Stanley Kubrick morphed Stephen King's bestselling novel into something almost unrecognizable, yet THE SHINING stands the test of time and continues to scare generation after generation of wide-eyed viewers because the one-card-shy-of-a-full-deck Jack Torrance is so aptly and believably played by a demonically grinning Jack Nicholson.  No other part has been so tailor-made for Creepy Jack, who fits into the lead role like wiggling fingers into a well-worn glove.Kubrick supplies the heady visuals:  a luxury mountain resort, about to be abandoned for the long winter, with its whispers of the past, labyrinth of hallways, and dark shadows.  Duvall and Nicholson supply the tension:  a struggling writer about to go off the deep end with his wife and small son living as caretakers at the resort, while the wife watches helplessly as her spouse unravels.  The hotel plays its part helping Jack Torrance descend into maniacal madness, giving Nicholson the vehicle he needs to grin and grimace and scream and shout as he terrorizes his family with flesh-crawling creepiness.Sure, there are plenty of flaws; the film becomes silly and disjointed as it rushes towards its climax, some of the visual gimmicks (gallons of what looks like cranberry sauce spilling out of the elevators) are lame, and Duvall was definitely a weak link, but it doesn't take away from THE SHINING's ability to terrify.

This overblown, over-hyped, overacted, and over-distributed filmmaking debacle is now being released as a special 2-Disc Special Edition.  Pardon me while I play the grand piano...Originally released in 1980(?), this stinker is based on the novel by Stephen King.  As in most cases, the book is 50 times better--not to mention SCARIER--than this movie.  A friend of mine accompanied me to the cinema to see this when it was first released.  We both had such HIGH hopes:  directed by Stanley Kubrick, starring Jack Nicholson--what could possibly go wrong?  Fifteen minutes into the movie and we both realized MUCH had gone wrong.The novel was about a man's GRADUAL descent into madness.  Nicholson's characterization of Jack Torrence was absolutely despicable from the outset.  It was as if he only tolerated his wife and child.  He took the job of overseer at the Overlook Hotel in Colorado because he thought it would jump-start his writing career.  Once they family arrived at the hotel, I was hoping that would jump-start something.  Disappointed yet again.Shelly Duvall plays Wendy Torrence.  Her's was the ONLY performance I thought was believable.  She managed to capture confusion, horror, and pathos all at the right times.  I don't remember the cherub who played Danny, the son.  The only thing I remember was how ridiculous he looked with his ""talking finger.""  See, Danny had the gift to ""shine""--see the future; predict the future--whatever you want to call it--and in the book his imaginary friend Tony always ""appeared"" when something bad was going to happen.  How difficult would it have been for Kubrick to simply shoot this?  TOTALLY unbelievable and COMPLETELY ridiculous!  And it only gets worse.Many have said this movie is the ""scariest of all time.""  Yeah, right; and these are magic beans...  Kubrick, it is said, contacted King and asked him how he would feel if ""he killed everyone.""  I'm glad King at least balked at that.  Kubrick had already bastardized most of his book, including completing overlooking the fact that it was the heating system that held that hotel together.  If you let it overheat, all hell would break loose.  AND he had the original hero of the book (Halloran--played here by Scatman Crothers) fly back from Miami to get hit in the chest with an axe and die.I'm not sure but I think the movie last about 3 days.  It is rated R for retarded.  So many have said that Kubrick paid so much detail to how the movie was shot.  It's a shame that's the ONLY thing he was concerned about."	1.0	The Shunning	2007-10-24	50	8	42

I read 2001 A Space Odyssey as a kid in high school, and i LOVED that novel! Kubrick's movie knocked my socks off! Since then, i became a devoted reader of his books. I have never read Stephen King's novel The Shining, but i had seen and read many of Mr. King's movies and novels. The Shining is one of my all-time favorite horror movies. Jack Nicholson was the perfect choice to play the role of Jack Torrence in the movie, and Shelley Duvall as his wife, Wendy, did a fine job as well. Danny Lloyd, who played their young son Danny was also suberb. The colors and sound quality are much better than the origional DCD video. It was nice to view this Blu-ray disc without having to make any adjustments to the picture. (eg. hitting the zoom button on the Blu-ray player to cut off the black borders on the top and bottom of the picture) I understand the concepts of Letterboxing, but I've always been annoyed by the black borders on the screen.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A29COAL60SB48B	Donna Di Giacomo	Jack Nicholson turned in yet another convincing performance as Jack Torrance, who is hired to be the caretaker of The Overlook Hotel for the off-season.  He relishes the opportunity to get his marriage back on track and to jumpstart his writing career.  Instead, the isolation causes Jack to lose his mind, see flashbacks of the previous caretaker's family murdered, and to set out for a repeat.  His family suffers from the isolation just as much and that causes further strain in Jack's marriage.I haven't read Stephen King's novel so I can't make a fair comparison but the movie was done quite well and Nicholson, as always, played his part so well that you feel as though you're losing it along with Torrance.The late Stanley Kubrick may not have faithfully translated King's tale to the big screen but it's pretty good, nonetheless.	4.0	Nicholson rocks us yet again	2005-12-15	6	3	3

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2UUWETDYA2EKV	Douglas Doepke	If The Shining were about camera work and atmosphere only, it would rank with Kubrick's best, which is to say about as good as the movies get. To Kubrick's handheld camera and cinematic imagination, the hotel's vast empty corridors and adjacent rooms become a labyrinth of horror in which evil of any kind might emerge. Only The Sixth Sense, of recent vintage, comes close to capturing the same spooky anything-can-happen atmosphere of the Shining's Overlook Hotel. If the film were about script only, it would still rate an arguable 5 stars, as Kubrick &amp; Co. substitute mood and spectral apparitions in place of the book's hokier parts, such as flying topiary. Nor do I think the film is overlong, since a leisurely buildup is essential to the crashing, mind-altering climax.But this is not the early Kubrick, the sure-hand behind Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, or 2001. This is Kubrick in decline. A director who either cannot or will not control the wild excesses of his celebrity-star Jack Nicholson in the film's pivotal role. In a part that fairly cries out for sublety and nuance, especially in limning the descent into madness, we get instead a leering, smirking self parody of an actor obviously wallowing in a chance to pull out all stops. And who can believe that that dreadful mood-killing line, &quot;Here'sss Johnny!&quot; is actually in the script. Rarely has such a grossly self-indulgent performance been allowed to reach the screen in unaltered form. And for that, there is only Kubrick to ultimately blame.I realize I risk offending Nicholson's legion of fans for whom this &quot;cool dude&quot; can do no wrong. But the fact is he traded in his acting credentials soon after Cuckoo's Nest for the easier road of self-parody, in which the silk purse of Five Easy Pieces becomes the sow's ear of the typical Nicholson Role.

I actually visited the hotel in Estes Park, Colorado where Stephen King stayed that inspired this book.  I also heard an interview with King where he talked about working in a Laundromat and living in a trailer, being shut in the trailer with his screaming children while it was snowing.  Jack Nicholson is fantastic in this movie as an alcoholic father cooped up with his kids while snowed in as a caretaker in a haunted hotel.  He literally goes stir crazy and starts drinking and battling his demons.  When he comes down the hall with the ax in his hand, I think it is one of the best scenes ever in a psychological horror film.

Kubrick just pulls you into the story and sets up an atmosphere of fear and uneasiness with a great cast and haunting images.  Did I mention that he compiled a great cast?  The actors he chose were perfect for their roles (more specifically Jack, his wife and child) that makes the movie that much more unusual and terrifying.  I remember watching this when I was a kid late at night and being extremely scared, but at the same time intrigued by how odd it is.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2LAQUPC5D46BS	D. Saunders	Despite the obvious limitations inherent to this DVD, this  film &quot;shines&quot; through. Kubrick delivers an absolutely brilliant interpretation of King's novel. The film itself continues to be a personal  cult favorite, but the Kubrick touches should cement this opus in the  pyschological horror hall of fame. Kubrick manages to film at  simultaneously alternative depths. The soundtrack is superb -  excrutiatingly effective. Casting is sublime. Jack 's role requires no  comment: what scene has been more memorable in this actor's entire  repertoire than his axe wielding confrontation with Wendy? Ms. Duvall,  while mildly abrasive, is effective at creating support for Jack as the  anti-protangonist. Danny Lloyd nearly steals the show (if it weren't for  Jack) as the innocently attuned lad who survives the madness. Scatman  Crothers also delivers a memorable performance as Danny's extra-sensory  mentor. This DVD's faults include a lame audio/video duplication and no  option, at least, for the 1:66 to 1 format; nonetheless, I am thrilled to  own this film on DVD and am infintiely pleased with the inclusion of Vivian  Kubrick's &quot;The Making of...&quot; which will prove incredibly  insightful for any Kubrick fan or The Shining fanatic.	5.0	Unparalled Masterpiece	1999-10-18	0	0	0

Melli	"Everyone has that one horror film that marked them as a kid and ""made them afraid to be alone"" or ""made them never want to look at a TV again"" or ""made them dread that long, dark hallway.""  For me, that one horror film was this masterpiece, Stanley Kubrick's ""THE SHINING"".  I clearly remember, when I was 6 years old, it was the classic ""dark and stormy night"" (making the mood all the more scary) I saw a little more than half of this movie on TV.  My mom told me not to watch it, but my dad said I'd be fine.  At that time, NO, DAD, I WAS NOT FINE!!!!!!!!  I finally had enough common sense, even though I was little, to turn off the TV at one point; I'm pretty sure it was right after the ""rotting old lady in bathtub scene"".  This movie scarred me for literally three years after that!  I MEAN IT REALLY TRAUMATIZED ME!!! And my family knew it, too.  Whenever we'd go to the video store, my sister would grab a copy off the shelf and hold it to my face and scream loudly and I cried once or twice out of the 900 times she did it.  I always thought, ""Yeah, you can just shut up, Christina, because you didn't even see the movie!""  Just the sight of the cover freaked me out!  Oh...that face...that creepy, heart-stopping smile!  I was always afraid to be upstairs alone; I was afraid I'd see the two twin ghost girls at the end of my long hallway when I opened my bedroom door and I was afraid for a while to pull back the shower curtain on the bathtub for fear of the undead rotting woman getting out and attacking me.  NOW, THAT'S SIGNS OF A GREAT HORROR MOVIE!  The movie does what it wants to do, which is scare the hell out of you! Then, one night, I decided to face my fears because I thought my hair was going to start falling out from stress pretty soon!  I asked my dad to take me to the video store, I got there, I stared at the cover of the movie for like five minutes, I think I may have even punched it at the end of those five minutes, I moved the box aside and took the rental copy behind it.  I remember my dad saying ""yeah?  You sure you wanna go for it?""  I said, ""Yes,"" feeling proud inside. I rented it.  I watched it.  Now, surprisingly, this is one of my all-time favorite films and i own the DVD.  I finally finished the movie and let me tell you, there's far more scary stuff than the hour and twenty minutes I saw!  Truly a classic psychological masterpiece of modern horror!  Jack Nicholson and the greasy-haired, messy, wide-eyed Shelly Duvall both do great!"	5.0	"""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!"""	2003-07-21	3	1	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"Stephen King has inspired two kinds of movie adaptations -- the ones that are brain-meltingly bad (""Dreamcatcher"") and the ones that are considered quite good (""Misery,"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"").""The Shining"" is often considered to be the best adaptation of King's works ever, primarily because it was directed by Stanley Kubrick. However... it's actually a pretty terrible adaptation. A very chilling horror movie -- if excessively slow for the first four-fifths -- but it has little in common with King's story. Also, a good man turning evil is less suspenseful when he's played by Jack Nicholson.Teacher-turned-writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) accepts a job as the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, a luxury mountain resort. He figures that since the Overlook is completely cut off by snowfall in the winter months, it would be the perfect time for him to get some writing done.  His wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) is eager to stay at the overlook. but his young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) is having premonitions about the Overlook.Why? According to the chef Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers), he has the ""shining,"" which is basically any psychic abilities that the plot should demand. Unless you're an African-American man, in which case they will go on the fritz just so you can die. Movie cliches must be maintained!At first, the Torrance family seems to be enjoying themselves -- Jack has plenty of time to write, and Wendy and Danny are able to explore the giant hotel and hedge maze. But Danny keeps seeing disturbing visions of creepy twins, ""redrum"" and rivers of blood. And Jack is quickly falling into the sway of the Overlook, becoming more violent and vicious towards his wife and son...One thing to keep in mind about ""The Shining"" is that... well, it's a TERRIBLE adaptation. Had this movie been made by Joe Director instead of the great Stanley Kubrick, it would probably have been despised for how much of the original novel was discarded -- in particular, how much of the supernatural elements were cut out completely... just so Kubrick could insert his OWN supernatural elements.It feels like Kubrick liked a one-sentence summary of the movie (""Writer stays in a haunted hotel with his family, goes insane and tries to kill them""), but had contempt for the original story (presumably because it's mere pulp horror). This gives ""The Shining"" a peculiar unevennness -- some parts are pure King, others are pure Kubrick.Taken purely on its own merits, ""The Shining"" is an excellent psychological thriller -- lots of icy, eerie atmosphere, with pale light and cold, echoing rooms. Kubrick fills every scene with a feeling of tension building just under the surface until it erupts into blood and screams. The story is rather slow-moving until the ax-swinging climax, but Torrance's legendary rampage is definitely worth seeing.However, the casting of Jack Nicholson was a mistake. Jack Torrance starts as an ordinary man, but is slowly devoured from within by his demons and resentments. The problem is... Nicholson already looks evil. He ALWAYS looks evil. He is incapable of NOT looking evil. So when he is turned into a sinister cackling lunatic by the Overlook, it doesn't really feel like much has actually changed.The rest of the cast is pretty solid, though -- Duvall gives a fluttering, weepy performance here, but she does give the impression that Wendy has some guts. Lloyd gives a decent performance as Danny, and Crothers is waaaaayyy underused as the kindly psychic chef... who inexplicably can't see Jack coming. I still don't understand that.""The Shining"" is a very good psychological thriller on its own, but ends up feeling uneven and weird because of the bizarrely unfaithful way it was adapted. Very creepy, but a really bad adaptation."	3.0	"She called it ""shining"" (spoilers)"	2013-05-24	2	1	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	ALVBM3RPSSLU1	Emily Elizabeth	The first time I ever saw Kubrick's film The Shining I was in middle school watching it with my sister late into the night. Circumstances as they were the movie terrified me. It takes advantage of the idea that catastrophic events leave an imprint on the places they occurred. The idea was so intriguing that I became fascinated by the film itself. Now, in college, I decided to revisit the Overlook by reading the book. After reading the novel I understand completely why Stephen King disliked Kubrick's adaptation. I found myself wondering how the screen play even came from King's novel.The film gives no background about Jack's troubling history, aside from him accidentally injurying Danny. Jack's character has so much depth that is not explored in the film. Granted, Jack Nicholson must be given credit for his portrayal of Jack Torrance. Nicholson has the ability to take a weak script and develop a character that is tantalizingly mad.The most frustrating point in the film is at the end when Wendy is running through the hotel and is confronted by many of its images. The history of these images is addressed in the book but there is no precedent for them in the movie. I understand that it is impossible to include all of the details in any novel in a cinematic adapation, but to present them as random images is confusing to the audience. Other unnecessary changes made in the screenplay include the hedge maze (in the novel the Overlook is actually guarded by animal topiaries) and a major change in the outcome of Jack's insanity.I highly recommend the novel The Shining to anyone who watched the movie and enjoyed it - reading the book gives you an entirely different perspective. However, to anyone who has not seen the film - read the book first, and then if you're still curious about the movie rent it.	2.0	Poor adaptation of King's novel	2004-09-12	15	9	6

Anyway, this newly restored and remastered version of The Shining looks and sound fabulous. Vibrant colors (no bleeding), nice smooth image, nicely detailed, clear Dolby 5.1. The previous abomination of a DVD was one of the worst DVDs to be produced by a major studio. Very grainy, pixely, washed out colors, horrific sound fidelity. They used the transfer for the early eighties VHS edition for that DVD. Ludicrous. This new edition could have used more extras but it includes a delighfully playful commentary by Vivian Kubrick on the documentary she shot on the making on the film. This documentary didn't have the commentary on the previous version and appears to have been remastered as well for this version. Well done!

His son Danny would have visions of someone telling him not to go to the outlook, but in the end they decided to go. Everything seemed ok when they got their but they were going to be the only ones their since during the winter months that it would close only the caregiver and if he choose his family would stay there. Little by little Danny the child started seeing things that he couldnt explain, but his parents wouldnt believe him. He was always lead to an especific room where a father had killed his twin daughters and wife before killing himself. The surprise turn happens when his father Jack is the one going crazy from the isolation that he to begins seeng people. The difference between them two was that jack had really become possesed by the hotel and decided to kill his wofe and danny. They outsmarted him and he ended up deying.

Picture and sound quality (5.1 and PCM both sound excellent) is top notch, and the special features are actually worth watching; the steadicam feature, the ""Making Of"" which highlights Kubrick's abilities as a visual and psychological director (he practically torments his actors to get the agitation and desperation out of each take), and the documentary filmed by his daugther. This is a necessary upgrade for any Kubrick enthusiast or fan of the movie (or both for that matter).** The movie is in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, not 1.66:1 like Amazon's specs say. Also, this is the uncut version, not the European edit.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	"You've probably seen this movie before. Either that or you've at least heard of it somewhere. Yes, Stanley Kubrick's loose adaptation of Stephen King's ""The Shining"" has become one of the most famous horror films of all time. It's been praised by critics including Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin, and has been parodied in music videos and TV shows such as The Simpsons. It may not be loved by Stephen King himself, but I, including millions of others, love it. It's not your typical Hollywood-style horror film, and it doesn't want to be like one. It doesn't have any loud ""jump"" music or annoying teenagers or underdeveloped villains. This is a very unique film that stands on its own. It's not the blood and gore that make this film very special, but the eerie atmosphere that is present throughout the film. It also delivers some haunting images and iconic performances. Now I do like a few recent horror films such as Saw, Event Horizon, and House of 1,000 Corpses, but The Shining remains as my #1 favorite in this specific genre.Like many other Kubrick films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Full Metal Jacket, critics and audiences have analyzed the entire movie. There have been film critics and college professors who always discuss everything from the opening aerial shot to the photograph right before the end credits. I don't think that's really necessary, because The Shining isn't supposed to be fully analyzed. It's up to us to decide for ourselves what the story is all about. For some, it could be the effects of isolation and how it transforms into insanity. For others, it could be how the spirits that dwell in the Overlook Hotel are messing with these people's minds. For me, I would go for the latter. True, a few scenes seem like they come out of nowhere, and have no relevance to the plot (the man in the bear costume, for example). But the images themselves are so grotesque and so undeniably scary, that you can't help but be amazed by them.But aside from the ambiguous story and some terrifying images, I think the strongest elements in the film are not only the eerie atmosphere, but also Jack Nicholson's performance. Nicholson is without a doubt a fascinating actor; he knows how to play crazy. Here, you can see some fine examples. Nicholson was rightfully cast as the lead character; he knows how to be frightening and intimidating when he slowly becomes psychotic. It's a very effective performance, and one of his greatest in his entire career. The other performers do extraordinarily well themselves. Scatman Crothers is believable as the chef Dick Hallorann, while Danny Lloyd is surprisingly good as Danny. Shelley Duvall, despite all the complications during filming, really pulled it off with her character Wendy. Her fear and desperation look genuine. I don't think anyone else would have done a better job than her.At least 95 percent of the reviewers here have nothing but praise for this movie, and I am part of the majority. I won't say much about The Shining, since it'll probably make this review look like a short story, but I will say that it's one of my favorite films, and my top favorite horror film of all time. Kudos to Kubrick, Nicholson, Duvall, Crothers, etc.Grade: A"	5.0	Kubrick + Nicholson + King = Horror Classic	2010-02-26	1	0	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1XQ7UL7A41DNT	Eric T. Hanson	One of the most controversial movies in Stanley Kubrick's lexicon, The Shining polarizes fans of the book and film a great deal. It is, to say the least, not very true to the original novel by Stephen King, and becomes a totally different story unique to this version. So how is it as a movie?It is a masterpiece. Kubrick is one of the greatest film makers of all time with such classics as 2001, Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange under his belt. The Shining is probably his most accessible movie for a general audience. I first saw this film when I was 13, and even then I was aware it was something special. That and I always wondered just what the movie playing during the drive in scene from Twister was. What Kubrick does is rather than simply adapt King's novel verbatim, he tweaks it to make it something uniquely his own, only using King's novel as inspiration for his original take on the story. This will understandably upset a great deal many people. I am a King fan myself, and have enjoyed many of his books and film adaptations. But tweaking a story can improve it in certain ways. The film alterations of The Shawshank Redemption have since become signature parts of the story, and that film is universally loved. The Shining should receive a similar reception.Jack Nicholson delivers one of his signature performances in this film as the slowly unhinging Jack Torrance, an oddly sympathetic but thoroughly frightening villain. Ol Jack always was a trooper with acting, creating a variety of colorful characters from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to Five Easy Pieces. Here, he delivers one of his more crazy performances and it is a treat to watch. The rest of the cast, Duvall, Crothers and Lloyd, do very nicely. Lloyd especially delivers a turnout performance as Jack's frightened son in probably the best performance by a child in a horror film.One of the most interesting parts about the story (book and film) is the setting. Isolating the characters was always effective in horror stories such as Alien and The Thing. Like the latter, this film uses the cold and snow to cut off the characters from just walking out the door. It really makes the hotel become not a beautiful mansion, but a spooky maze from which there is no escape. The choice of hotel for both the interior and exterior was just fabulous, and allows for many great images to be created on the movie. And it is just perfect for building atmosphere.The film varies in just how it creates fear. First, it is fear by suggestion, with creepy images and dark shadows that slowly build a sense of dream. One of the creepiest moments in the film is when the young Danny is lured into room 237 whilst playing in the halls of the hotel. This scene boasts a minimalist score, some oddly symmetrical images that are somehow very unsettling, and it draws out the scene to the point that it is almost torture. Not until the final third does Jack become the mad axe man, and the film dispenses with its sense of dread and opens the floodgates into total terror. It is this section of the film that most people remember, and it is not hard to see why as it is very well executed. However, the two thirds before that are also something to see. Who knew a kid looking down a hallway could look so damn creepy?The two disc DVD delivers the good with a host of features, including the classic trailer for the film and the original documentary from its original release date. Not a lot of new material, and that is kind of sad, but still great stuff.If you are a Stephen King fan, just remember this. This is not a Stephen King movie. It is a Stanley Kubrick movie. Don't put it in with the book, and view it on its own merits. If you are able to do that, you are in for one of the best horror films ever made.	5.0	Not a Good Adaptation of the Book, but a Great Movie Nonetheless	2013-08-23	1	1	0

Mostly when grown-ups tell me that a movie is very very scary, I don't tend to think so.Not in this case.""The Shining"" kept me curled up in my chair with my eyes glued to the screen. The tension never lets you rest, not for the whole 2.5 hours! The music helps a lot; it's absolutely electrifying. So are the performances by Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. Some say they overract a lot; ...They capture a sense of reality like nobody I've ever seen before. They should've won Oscars. It also has some of the greatest photography I've ever beheld infront of a TV set.While the story moves at a somewhat slow pace, it does not a thing to ruin the experience...in fact, it probably helps it out (exactly like ""The Exorcist""). Viewers be warned: it is very wierd, especially the ending, but hey, it's Stanley Kubrick for Godsakes! What do you expect?!This is certainly one of the all-time great horror movies ever made, in every aspect. While I've heard that it doesn't stick especially to Stephen King's original book, I haven't read it, so I couldn't care less.Watch it on a dark and stormy night, with the lights low...it'll scare the living daylights outta ya! And be sure to watch it on the excellent Stanley Kubrick Collection DVD; the picture and sound quality is flawless. It's in full-screen, but that's what S.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	What he did for science fiction in 1968 with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the late, great Stanley Kubrick did for horror in 1980 with THE SHINING--he made a film that people keep talking about and debating.  This very lengthy 144 minute-long horror film, though it does diverge wildly from the Stephen King source material, maintains an aura of mystery and suspense throughout in its story of a family of three taking care of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado during the winter off-season and succumbing to its power.  In this respect, the basic structure of King's novel is still very much in place.Jack Nicholson's performance as the father figure of the piece has caused wildly divergent opinions; he's either maniacally right or too far over-the-top.  All I can say is that it worked for me, especially with his &quot;Here's Johnny!!&quot; line.I can't think of too many horror movies whose camera work and production design are anywhere in the class of this particular film; these elements are almost every bit as chilling as the movie itself.  Kubrick also uses very dissonant classical works by such composers as Bartok, Ligeti, and Penderecki to underlie the film's atmosphere.  The film also achieves one of the horror genre's greatest moments by showing a huge tidal wave of blood spilling out in slow-motion from the hotel's elevators.Like anything Kubrick made in his life (and like the more recent Kubrick/Spielberg collaboration A.I.), THE SHINING must be seen with an open mind.  Just for myself, this film is one of the best horror films ever made because Kubrick's images linger in the mind long after the film itself has ended.	5.0	Here's Johnny!!!	2001-07-10	5	4	1

I think that every actor and actress does a great job, especially Danny Lloyd, the son.  Stanley Kubrick takes a different route with horror  by giving the audience a psychotic twist and who better to deliver it than  Jack Nicholson.  The movie is scary and suspenseful and in some scenes,  Nicholson goes so crazy it's hilarious. I bought this on DVD so it would  last a long time and have great sound &amp; picture.  The picture is grainy  and has black spots that flicker every so often. Some scenes are better  than others.  The sound is awful, I had to turn up the volume all the way  to hear it comfortably and it's in mono audio. (I would have given this  movie 5 stars but because of the disappointing DVD format.) It does have a  plus though, a quite long and interesting Behind the scenes documentary  made by Kubrick's wife that has up close interviews with everyone and you  even get to see Kubrick work with the actors.  Great movie, but could have  been done a lot better on DVD.  (Try reading the book.)	4.0	Hoped for much better on DVD	2000-03-19	12	12	0

The &quot;Making Of&quot; featurette is a charming &quot;day-in-the-life&quot; type of documentary filmed and edited by Kubrick's wife. It opens with her  following him into his bathroom and then downstairs for filming. Jack is  his nuerotic and entertaining self the whole way. Highlights include the  little boy saying confidently that he was probably earning &quot;$500.00 or  $600.00 dollars&quot;, and Kubrick yelling at doe-eyed Shelly Duvall trying  desperately to defend the fact that missed her cue. As for the film itself,  we've all seen it. Kubrick's signature is lingering shots with haunting  music. Mood is his canvas, and it is very attractive. No other S. King film  is anywhere near &quot;The Shining&quot; in class and style. Jack  Nicholson's most intense roll to date. I suppose Duvall was very effective  in that I spend most of the movie wanting to slap the sh*t out of her  myself. Another trailer would have been nice because I don't remember this  one. It is merely the elevator door blood thing and the title. Anyway, a  nice addition to any DVD collection.	4.0	a classic accomplishment for Kubrick	1999-07-12	7	3	4

Nothing like this here.  The back cover tells you:  ""The first epic horror film - Jack Kroll, Newsweek"".  That is not true.The scene in the bathroom, meant to be frightening, is just plain funny -- comic relief in a boring movie.  Jack Nicholson is not convincing as a madman: what you see is just an actor trying to look frightening.  His wife is good at screaming and being afraid, but somehow she doesn't manage to make you share her fear.In short, a boring movie, but you do watch it to the end, hoping that finally you will get some of the promised horror.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1WUGLK5OIZVIZ	"""filmbuff2000"""	This is one of Kubrick's lesser efforts, but then again almost all fo  Kubrick's films have become milestones in their genre and this is no  exception. Filled with unsettling images and chilling sequences that stay  with you long after the first viewing. `Chilling' is probably the best way  to describe this film, the pace drags is spots here and there but maybe  Kubrick intended that to heighten the sense of seclusion and boredom which  than produces `cabin fever' and then things tend to get a bit scary. The  use of steady-cam cinematography is great and the low-key score really  heightens the suspense. Jack Nicholson goes way over the top at times, but  still, he delivers a compelling performance. Shelley Duvall, on the other  hand, is very effective as Nicholson's wife who must protect his son  against Nicholson's maniac killer. Once Nicholson begins his descent into  madness is when the film really gets on its feet. Many now-classic scenes  such as the `Heeeeere's Johnny' sequence and the chilling ending. Stephen  King aficionados may argue that the novel is better, and in many ways it  is, but this film survived best in the audience's mind and in America's  culture.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2FIEBYAFQIIIP	FJN	Like those people who are in the Gold Room as skeletons. Well, presumably they represent the people who used to work at the Overlook (or at least visited) and have died. As for the way ghost Grady appears to let Jack out of the food locker room Jack has the Shining as Danny does and this is a psychic ability. Perhaps Jack also has telekinetic powers he is just unaware of and he just imagined Grady was there doing it. The man in the photo who looks just like Jack. Well, it is possible that Jack had the shining when he came to the Overlook and he shined in on the happenings that went on in the 20's there and felt hew as there because a fellow who looked so damn much like him was there at the time. My view is there were no ghosts at all at The Overlook and the entire bizarre happenings were the Shinings of Jack, Wendy, Danny and Halloran and telekinetic powers of Jack.PS Remember, Grady was not at the Overlook in the 20's. He was just there in the late 60's early 70's. Jack imagined him at the roaring 20's party.	5.0	About the visions seen in the Shining	2005-12-23	8	4	4

Like most Kubrick films, `The Shining' is deliberately detached and calculating. I believe that the performance by Nicholson at times (although progressively over the top), as well as Crothers (the only character I cared about; it is difficult to care about a character in a Kubrick film) are fine. I think Duvall was miscast and the boy was rather annoying with the hokey ""redrum"" scribblings and the obnoxious finger talking. Overall character development is lacking.From a cinematographic point of view, there are some excellent shots, although they don't necessarily lend themselves to a feeling of suspense or tension (contrast this with the editing and shot selection in `Psycho'). I think that the pacing of this film is at times quite tedious. The film is not scary. While the film's psychological underpinnings are interesting, the plot itself has holes. I find it convenient that the police don't bother to check out a remote place where there was a gruesome murder when the radio stops working. I would venture to guess that over five months some cops would drop by to check out what is going on at least once or twice, especially if there wasn't any contact. Crothers takes a day to get to the place. You think he could have called the authorities? They might have gotten there a tad quicker. The wife also should have known her husband was losing it and could have made an effort to get out before he started to try and slash her. I don't think this is necessarily a flaw since she seemed to be in a state of denial herself. The boy's ability to ""shine"" is never really played out and ultimately ancillary to Jack's descent into madness.Some reviewers consider this to be the best horror film of all time. That is an absurd statement. If Kubrick wasn't the director, would this claim be made? I doubt it. He's good, very good, but it doesn't mean `The Shining' is great. Stake your claim for a gender leader with '2001' or 'Dr. Strangelove', not 'The Shining.' It is clearly inferior to Psycho (by eons) and a number of offerings from Universal and Hammer, not to mention `Halloween' (released two years prior to `The Shining'), `Alien,' and plenty of others."	3.0	Not enough luster for 'The Shining'	2006-01-08	12	6	6

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2EIRCMHTO7CUI	Frank Messely	"Whole volumes have been written about Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING, proving that it is indeed a masterpiece of modern horror.  A not to be underestimated element which makes this film full of atmosphere and tension is the lighting.  Every time I watch it I'm sucked up in the Overlook's universe because of that brilliant use of light.  In the European shorter version Kubrick wisely omitted the `skeletons in the lobby' tableau, which was right for a Hammer Dracula or Corman Poe film, but not THE SHINING.  Due to this photography and lighting, Kubrick makes of the Overlook a place where reality and nightmare blend.  And then there is the way in which he approaches the story (read:  alters King's story), thereby making it a much stronger ghost story.  In particular the surprise at the end (Jack Torrance picture on the wall) is a brilliant move which leaves us with the same feeling of disorientation as when we start awake from a nightmare.  That sort of confusion leaves us - at least for a while - mentally vulnerable, a prey to the horrors lurking in the subconscious.  King's book and Stanley's film should be seen as two totally different works of art (I still consider the book to be Stephen King's real masterpiece - a classic!).  Yet, the subtler approach of Kubrick places the story on a much higher level.  Perhaps these words by M. R. James explain it all:  ""the greatest successes have been scored by the authors who can make us envisage a definite time and place, and give us plenty of clear-cut and matter-of-fact detail, but who, when the climax is reached, allow us to be just a little in the dark as to the working of their machinery. We do not want to see the bones of [the] theory of the supernatural.""  That's what Kubrick's THE SHINING is all about, allowing us a peek into a terrifying universe where man starts to doubt his own sanity, where he loses track of time, forever doomed (is this, perhaps, the reason why Kubrick uses roll-up titles for the opening credits, something usually used for the end credits?).  With THE SHINING, Kubrick made a timeless chef-d'oeuvre."	5.0	Timeless	2009-10-11	6	4	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	I am a big fan of Stanley Kubrick and although I liked2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray],A Clockwork Orange (Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray] andDr. Strangelove  [Blu-ray] a whole lot more there is enough of Kubrick in this film for me to enjoy it although truth be told this is not as scary as sayThe Exorcist (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray] and if you are looking to be scared out of your wits this is not the film for you.  If you like giving your eyes a feast and your mind a relaxing treat the way only Kubrick can through his uncanny gift of the composition of a picture that intrigues your mind so much that you become addicted and find yourself revisiting the film over and over again as if to reassure yourself that you actually saw what you thought you saw the last time - this is the only way I can explain why I keep wanting to watch the three films I mentioned at the start of this review over and over again and why this is also the case with this film although admittedly the storyline as a horror film is pretty weak and is certainly not one of the film's strong points - then you'll enjoy this film a whole lot more.Strangely though, Kubrick is such a great film-maker and there are so many other facets to his craft that I found myself forgiving this film for having a poor script because I was too busy enjoying the great visual stimulation I get from watching this film.  I thought the tsunami of blood from the lift was really stupid and made me want to laugh but there are many other scenes that are just stunning to behold.  It felt like I was in an art gallery at times watching a quick succession of masterpieces pass before my eyes.  I particularly liked the low moving camera scenes that closely followed the child as he tricycled around the hotel culminating in the shot where he encounters the twins in the corridor.  I thought Nicholson and Duvall played their roles excellently and the casting overall was very well done.  I've never read the book nor do I intend to and so it doesn't bother me how closely or not this film follows the book.This blu-ray release though is disappointing as although the picture quality is pretty good the sound quality is very poor and the special features are nothing really to crow about.  Lots to enjoy in this film if you are a fan of Kubrick's unique gift of framing a picture to provide a veritable feast for the eyes and his uncanny ability to select excellent soundtracks to enhance the effect but don't try to understand the plot or expect to be scared out of your mind unless you scare easily.  When I tried to make sense of the story it just made me see how stupid the plot is and I couldn't understand the significance of the ending; did Nicholson somehow leave the picture and made the jump into the future just to get married, have a kid and to bring them to their deaths at the hotel?  The stupidity of it all boggles the mind but once I decided to just enjoy the rest of the film and ignore the ridiculous storyline I found I liked the film a whole lot more.Enough Kubrick-isms to love the film, good picture quality, poor sound quality and average special features makes this blu-ray release a bit of a mixed bag to say the least.	3.0	Like Any Kubrick Film, It Rewards Repeated Viewing But Blu-Ray Could Be Better!	2011-07-11	6	2	4
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3HETHW2XD3DWH	frisky2000	I'm reviewing the VHS edition, but from reading reviews on the excellent DVD extras, I'll probably want that edition as well.THE SHINING is pure and simple HORROR at its creepy best.  We are easily folded into the story from the beginning, and we hang on till the shattering ending.Jack and Wendy Torrance settle in as caretakes at the isolated Overlook Hotel in Colorado over the winter; their son, a kind of spooky fellow with some unearthly abilities himself, spends time riding his bike down the hotel corridors and talking to his imaginary friend, Tony.  He speaks in a different voice at times, and has visions of the young children who were murdered at the Overhook many years ago.Jack is a writer who grows increasingly frustrated with his wife, the claustrophobic nature of the hotel, and the writer's block that has such a strong grip on him that he literally spends hours typing the same sentence maniacally on his old fashioned typewriter.As we learn more about the history of the hotel, and weird visions begin occuring, like Jack having a drink at the bar (which is really compeltely barron of any alcohol) and talking with the barkeep, we begin to see just how deep into dementia this man is spiraling.Stephen King can take any road he wants with horror and still manage to keep the reader gasping for breath by the end.  We never lose sight of Jack's mounting rage, though he appears at time to be mellow and easy-going.  Wendy, though a devoted wife, is cooky and creepy in her own right, and despite rooting for her survival at the end, we almost want to shake some sense into her to leave the hotel way before disaster strikes.Having never read the novel, I cannot compare or critique the similarities or differences, but I truly enjoyed Kubrick's work here and have kept THE SHINING in my video arichive for decades.	5.0	Chilling Horror Classic	2005-06-04	3	1	2

The obvious reasons for it being so good are because of the acting talents of Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. Jack makes one creepy looking dad, even when he is sane. The script is just so well written and the actors do so well, how can you not be sucked into the movie? Being a Simpsons fan, I can't help but think of the parody they did of the movie years ago. This is just a classic film that may not be as scary as it once was, but it is still a great movie, and that will never change. Other remakes of the film have tried to capture the power of the original film, but nothing can touch this	5.0	A Classic From Beginning To End	2007-10-12	4	2	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1SP8AQ2FZ9SLJ	Gangrel353@CompuServe.com	Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall give both powerful and believable performances as Jack and Wendy Torrance respectively. The real star of this film though is the Overlook hotel itself. The most memorable scene for me  personally will always be the scene when Jack confronts Wendy and Wendy  actually walks backwards up the huge staircase while at the same time  defending herself with a baseball bat from Jack. When viewing pay close  attention to the scene when Wendy is left in the bathroom after Jack chops  down the door. Listen to the sound of the wind as it gives the scene an  errie and chilling effect.	5.0	The pinnacle of Horror films, the world over	1999-05-14	1	1	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2HU94KJ4SUFR0	"Garrett Stiger ""Gar"""	"""The Shining"" was Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s first, and only, film in the horror genre.  While not the masterpiece that ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""2001"" was, ""The Shining"" represents a terrific effort by Kubrick and is one of his more recognizable films.Kubrick&#8217;s adaptation of Stephen King&#8217;s novel differs, widely, from King&#8217;s story. This isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing; the novel and film were both good in their own way. Kubrick did, thankfully, edit down the vast amount of material presented in the novel.The performances are reasonable for a horror film. Jack Nicholson is effective but occasionally a little over the top. Shelley Duvall comes off as being quite annoying when she shrieks in her high, shrill voice. Danny Lloyd is believable as the troubled child, Danny Torrance.John Alcott&#8217;s cinematography is superb, particularly, his use of the steadicam in the opening title sequence and in the hallways of the haunted hotel, the Overlook, provides an eerie calm which is quite a contrast to most horror films which tend to be very loud in style.The moody, unnerving musical score is VERY good at getting one uncomfortable. A good example of its ability to make the audience uneasy is the piece of music played during the beginning title sequence, which provides a real sense of impending doom.The set design adds greatly to the eerie atmosphere of ""The Shining;"" the striking brightness of the Overlook&#8217;s walls contrasts nicely with the dark, heated colors of its chaotic-patterned carpets.""The Shining&#8217;s"" pacing is rather poor, especially for a horror film. Also, the last 10 or 15 minutes of the film betray the style that was set up by the beginning of the film. The beginning of the film contained very quiet, subdued terror, towards the end Kubrick uses cheap thrills and jack-in-the-box type terror.This DVD doesn&#8217;t boast a large amount of extras but I suppose what is given is adequate for this film. The trailer is particularly interesting and quite unlike any trailers you see today. The documentary, while not very long, provides an insightful look as to what went on behind the scenes of ""The Shining.""""The Shining"" is definitely one of the more effective horror films that I&#8217;ve seen; that&#8217;s not saying much, though, because lately most of the horror genre has been plagued by ill-conceived films such as ""Scream 3"" and ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later."""	4.0	A moody but flawed classic of the horror genre.	2001-08-15	4	3	1

Kubrick's unique style of cinematography is reflected in his previous works, so in a sense you could always spot a Kubrick film. Some critics have argued that Kubrick's films are too clinical and can leave the audiences somewhat detached, but I guess that's up to the beholder.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	"First of all, I'm a huge fan of both the novel and the 2 film adaptations.  Everyone out there seems to think that you need to hate at least one of these, but I don't.  Certainly, this version doesn't follow the novel closely at all, but this isn't an inherent flaw in the film.  It is what it is, and how closely it follows the source material is really neither here nor there.That aside, I just watched this movie for the first time in a couple of years, and I was surprised by how well it has held up.  Actually, I definitely like it better now than I ever did before.  Lotsa people, particularly King himself, have criticized this film as being a well-crafted, great looking film with no soul.(A common criticism of Kubrick's films in general, as a matter of fact.)  I think they have something of a point, actually- I don't like any of these characters much, and they are really quite flat and underdeveloped.  But, the striking visual and atmospheric qualities more than make up for a relative like of human interest.Lots has been made of the changes of the changes that Kubrick made to the general story line of the novel, particularly how the supernatural elements of the story have been downplayed somewhat, and how Jack Torrance is much more imbalanced and hostile from the outset.  I've read a fair bit of analysis/criticism of the film, and come across many laughable interpretations as to why the changes have been made.(Such as the suggestion that the hotel isn't haunted at all, a theory which holds no water whatsoever) Personally, I don't think there really is much of a thematic reason for the changes: Kubrick just needed to condense the story in order for it to fit into a 2 1/2 hour time frame, while adding in a fair number of his own episodes.  More significantly, Kubrick's approach to the material is completely opposite.  Despite the supernatural nature of the story, King's tale emphasized character, using innumerable internal monologues as the characters considered their various plights. Some people seem to act as if the decrease in supernatural activity meant that the psychological depth of the film is greater than in the novel, but this absolutely isn't true. The film version is externally concerned, as we never get to see much into a character other than Jack,(and we still can't really understand why Jack acts as he does) Wendy is reduced to a mere doormat, who rarely says anything more than bland pleasantries and platitudes, while Danny rarely says or does much of anything at all. I actually think this is necessary for the sorta of mood Kubrick seemed to be trying to achieve.  The film is icy, and inhuman- having warm, full human characters would reduce that feeling.  The film doesn't really seem concerned with how or why things happen, but simply on how they are shot.  This is definitely a valid approach,  and the film manages to have genuine amount of discomfort at pretty much all times, even when not a whole lot is actually going on.As with virtually all of my favorite horror movies, `The Shining' has stunning music and visuals.  The music is largely avant-garde classical stuff, from Ligeti and Bartok and others.  It's not the sorta thing I'd likely enjoy listening to it by its self, and it used to rather annoy me, but it's quite startlingly effective during the film.  I particularly like the song used during the opening scenes.  ""Dies Irae' I think it is.  Visually, this isn't quite like anything else I've ever seen.  It was made shortly after the creation of the steadicam, and Kubrick apparently fell in love with this new apparatus, illustrated by the near perpetual use of tracking shots.(If anyone ever moves from one part of the hotel to another, you can rest assured that you will get to see them walking there.)  I'm not really sure why the steadicam was used to  extensively, but it really works, establishing a visual motif to the film, and giving us a sense of the size and isolation of the Overlook, as well as illustrating the monotony of life their via numerous similar camera angles/movements.  That, and I just think that smooth, steadicam shots are, well, cool.`The Shining' has quite a few powerful images, even if some of them don't really seem to be here of there.  The famed blood-flood coming out of the elevator in slow-motion is extremely cool, and actually kinda creepy, I think.  The twin girls are quite creepy  as well, particularly when Danny sees them in the game room, and they somehow manage to seem to be floating, only semi-corporeal.  His final encounter with them is quite stunning as well, particularly the tight tracking shot of him rolling through the surreal, dollhouse corridors of the hotel.(Though there `scary ghost voices' don't quite work)  The final chase is quite excellent and nightmarish as well.(The hedge maze is very cool in general, as a matter of fact)  The absolute best shot would have to be just after Jack here Danny scream in the kitchen, and rises up from below the frame, nastily grinning.  Sadly, the encounter in 237 is totally botched.  It's just.... stupid, for the most part.  Kinda gross, no doubt, but pretty silly and it hurts the atmosphere of the film as a whole. But, the rest of the film is good enough that  it doesn't matter.The acting is more than competent, though nobody other than Jack Nicholson really does all that much.  Nicholson's performance is generally loved or loathed, but I come down somewhere in the middle.  He's pretty damn over the top much of the time, but well, he IS supposed to be crazy, ya know, and some of his other scenes are a bit more nuanced than many of the critics would have you believe.  He's definitely entertaining, and quite menacing at times, particularly in the very last act, after the main encounter in their apartment.Well, that's it.  Definitely one of my 10 favorite horror films.  I'd recommend you read the novel first, partially because I like it a lot, partially because the movie likely won't make a whole helluva lot of sense to someone who hasn't read it."	5.0	Classic Horror	2005-02-13	5	3	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3SP8WBIJMCMS5	Gregory J. Bendokus	First, a special message to all the fools who are chastising the DVD video for being full-frame and the sound for being mono.  If you folks had the SLIGHTEST clue, you would be aware that THIS IS HOW KUBRICK WANTED HIS  MOVIES TO BE RELEASED!  In theatres, The Shining was matted to 1:78 to 1, I  believe, so the home video actually shows MORE of the screen than you've  seen in the theatre.  Full Metal Jacket was the same way - have any of you  complainers ever seen a widescreen version of that? Duh!As for the  movie itself, what can you say?  It's one of the best horror flicks of all  time, and the only people who hate it are usually those who are unable to  THINK.  With every repeat viewing, you can find some new food for thought.  For example, when Jack yells at Wendy for breaking his concentration, after  she walks away you'll notice that he suddenly starts typing on a new piece  of paper which he DIDN'T put in the typewriter.  Is this a blooper? With  well-known-perfectionist Kubrick, I doubt it...seems to me like the hotel  is giving him paper! And when Scatman Crothers and Wendy are touring the  kitchen, how come Wendy is leading the way, even though she's never been  there?  Watch the scene and you'll see what I mean.The steadycam  shots, and the camera angles in general, especially the one where the  camera is looking UP at Nicholson in the storage room, are incredible -  it's plain to see that Kubrick was a genius.As for the DVD, the print  used is pretty worn, with reel-change marks, hairs, and who knows what  else, but it's still better than the videotape.  To me, The Shining always  had a grainy, old-looking appearance which is part of it's charm - but the  film (hell, ALL of his films) is due for a full restoration.The only  extra on the DVD is Vivian Kubrick's documentary, which is a treasure and  well worth the price of the DVD alone...the only other extra I could have  asked for is the original theatrical ending, which is probably  long-gone.A must-have!	5.0	Kubrick wanted this to be seen in 4:3 format!	2000-03-06	37	30	7

This movie is in its own  league above all others in its accurate portrayal of the feel, the  prescient atmosphere, and the palpable enveloping terror that surrounds the  family in the Overlook (not to mention myself when I read the book).  To  whine about it not including every occurence in the book is peurile King  fanboy nonsense.  If that's what you want, rent the 1997 TV movie.

However, if you like the horror like Nicholson can deliver, this is a must-see.  His line ""Here's Johnny,"" as he is trying to tear down the bathroom door, is not only classic Nicholson, but it captures the character's slow crawl down to evil.

There are some haunting images involving undead characters and  a butler who is more than he seems, but what really makes the film  unmissable is Jack Nicholson's overwhelming performance as a family man who  slowly becomes more irritable and unstable, ultimately resulting in an  edge-of-seat finale.	5.0	A masterpiece of horror.	2000-08-29	0	0	0

If your looking for blood and gore this movie wouldn't be for you. If you want an eerie feeling and some spine-tingling this may be for you.Despite hearing a horrifying tale of the previous hotel keeper(Grady) that lost his mind and brutally slaughtered his wife and twin daughters Jack Nicholson(Jack Torrence)and Shelly Duval(Wendy Torrence) decide to watch over a hotel in the mountains during the off season. Jack feels the quiet will help him finish the novel he's been working on. They bring along their young son Danny. Danny has a special ability to communicate telepathically. As the days go along the Jack begins losing his mind and we begin seeing the eerie visuals of the previously murdered family. The plot is a strong one. It starts off slow but builds to a great climax.This movie is certainly is remembered for two things I believe. The scene where King spills gallons and gallons of blood out of the elevator and the line ""Here's Johnny"" as the crazed Nicholson chops down the door with an axe in pursuit of his wife.Whether your a fan of suspenseful thrillers, a Stephen King fan, or just a fan of a well made movie The Shining is worthy of your collection."	4.0	HERE'S JOHNNY!!!!	2002-03-27	1	0	1

I believe that the best  'adaptations' are not those that are tightly based on the original novels,  but those that have borrowed from the originals and added their own sense  of brilliance.  This brilliance is recognizable throughout.  Every scene in  this movie was constructed intentionally, and the use of music, visuals,  and time reinforces the psychological effects it has on the viewer.  Don't  rent or buy this movie expecting Stephen King.  This film is totally  Kubrick.	4.0	Kubrick is King	2000-07-10	0	0	0

First, the sound: recorded in mono, and sounds ten times worse. Second, the picture: some of Kubrick's films have a tendency to look grainy, but this is ridiculous. It looks like it's been sitting on a shelf for the past twenty years, and when through a minimal amount of restoration. The special features are probably the best part of this DVD: there's Vivian Kubrick's &quot;Making of 'The Shining'&quot; documentary, a powerful insight behind the scenes of the film, and featuring Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall, Scatman Crothers, Stanley Kubrick, and even an interview with Danny Lloyd! Whatever happened to him anyway? It's pretty neat, even though it was cut by Kubrick from an hour to thirty minutes. There's also a trailer, featuring music by Wendy Carlos. Overall, an average DVD at best, but I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you reaaly love the film that much. I would wait until the new &quot;Shining&quot; DVD comes out in June. It has a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, in contrast to this one in mono. In other words, don't buy it!	2.0	The Shining DVD- Was it worth it, folks?	2001-06-03	7	5	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	ACB840X2RWJW1	Haris Baki	that Stanley Kubric decided to make a movie out of one of best horror stories around  and this was the pure lack of luck for King. I read the book 15 years ago and it is a cornerstone in my fondness to King. Having heard that it was a movie directed by Kubric (one of the directors I respect(ed before this movie) although I have not watched many of his works) I waited for years to find a very high quality version of it. For what? Just to see one of the worst book adaptations ever made. Jack is already crazy from the beginning...his wife, Wendy, is a hysterical silly thing that makes you want to grab the ax and cut her screaming tongue into two just to silence her...Danny, one of the most original characters in King's pallette, was turned into a shadow doing nothing but just cringing... a black cook who travels hundreds of miles just to get knifed as soon as he enters the hotel... sinister bush animals turning into silly labyrent...and worst of all, lots of unnecessary blood pouring from elevators (then why do you people hate Friday the 13th and Evil Dead because of lots of gush of blood) and two silly little girls supposed to be horrifying and foreshadowing. If you tell this summary to anyone and then make him read the book, he will say this has nothing to do with it...In itself alone the movie may be a nice and little horror movie with nothing exceptional...but as an adaptation, it is disgusting...just a reflection of Kubrick's unbearable arrogance trying to hint that he does anything and everything better.To sum up: I am so much disappointed and disgusted with the movie that I woved never to see any other Kubric film in my life. If you have read the book, never attempt to see the movie;If you have not watched the movie and read the book, then first see the movie and then read the book just to see what torment you have undergone. If you have seen the movie but not read thebook, please read it and see how unashamedly Kubrick was wrong with everything.	1.0	I am too unhappy	2003-05-10	30	11	19
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A18MBO1U4DPY20	Harkanwar Anand	"After having read the first page of the reviews for ""The Shining"", I'm sorry to say I find ""none"" of them  manage to describe this film. I saw this film last night and I quite liked a few things about the film which I will share with you.The Shining is about a big hotel and a three member family that moves into live there as caretakers. Jack Nicholson is an aspiring writer who finds that the big empty(cause of unfavourable weather) hotel is where he will give writing a book a shot. Things start happening and ultimately the family is left in absolute horror at the incidents that take place. The reason the film manages to have a huge effect on me was because of the big mansion the film was shot in. There are a hundred plus rooms and I really think the camerawork was quite awe-inspiring. Some very solid performances by the kid called Danny.Please Read-The reason the shining manages to hold the gravity and an everlasting fright mixed with entertainment impact on my mind is because of how non self-conscious it was. There is nothing in the film that the director seems to do just out of pleasing the audience. There are many things rather unexplained in the movie which keeps you thinking for quite a while. During the 2hours and 20minutes of this film I was almost completely absolved in the film.I would most definitely like to watch the movie again so I consider it worth purchasing if you have the money to.Also check out ""Thinner"" if you like this film. Although it's not one of those films that make you jump out of your seat it manages to entertain nonetheless. ""The Others"" is also another worthy recommendation."	4.0	Room 237	2005-11-05	9	2	7

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A457S8SW690NM	hi	"I am so shocked that this movie even received one bad review. One. Some of these reviews here say that the movie is boring, too complicated and not scary. When you see Danny riding his little troller, how aren't you hooked. When the naked girl ""transforms"", admit that you jumped out of your seat.This movie also isn't complicated, you just need to pay attention.The plot of the movie is one of the most creative that I've ever seen. It is said to be unfaithful to the Stephen King book. I never read it and mr. King must be a pretty cocky guy if he thinks that he can remake this movie and top it.This movie is perfect. No, I'm not kidding, it's perfect. Only this movie, Mulholland Drive and Psycho stand as perfect movies in my opinion. What I mean is that none of these movies have any flaws. They are 100% perfect.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a writer, takes a job to watch over and maintain a hotel complex up in the mountains in Denver. He goes there with his wife Wendy and son Danny.At firs, he seems to be the perfect fit for the job but that's before he becomes mad.Danny has the shining, an ability to see dead people and horrifiying images. He can also maintain conversations without opening his mouth. Danny Lloyd the actor who played him gives a performance that left me speechless.Jack is also seeing crazy stuff, talking to a guy who used to care over the place who went really crazy.The movie shows Jack on the brink of insanity. This movie shows the fear encountered towards a memeber of your family. And that is trully a terrifying thing.The score is brillinat, going along with the pace of the movie.The cinematography is my favorite part of the movie. It is the best of all time. It follows Danny on his troller from behind so you don't know what's around the corner. And that definitely builds up the chills.The acting is wonderful. Jack Nicholson gives his best performance and one of the best of all time. He is terrifying and has so many great lines. Just look at his movements, his tone of voice, his eyes, his grimaces, he is a creepy guy. His perfromance is chilling.Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd also give very good performances notably Lloyd.The Shining is an absolutely horrifying movie, and is one of the few movies that scare me.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2HFL26OQJ2T9X	H. Jin	The title of this review tells you what you need to know; despite this being based on a Stephen King novel, `The Shining' is very much Kubrick's baby. The supernatural and personal themes of King's novel are toned down, and many of the characters' traits are very different to those in the book. This version of `The Shining' is much closer to straightforward psychological horror, albeit with a very Kubrick twist.Jack Nicholson gives his character a very different feel to the Torrance of the novel, but his over-the-top performance is a memorable one. Really, Nicholson carries the entire film, although Scatman Crothers deserves praise for his performance as the sympathetic Halloran. There are also excellent cameos from Philip Stone as the sinister Grady, and Joe Turkel as Lloyd the bartender. Shelley Duvall, however, isn't so good; Kubrick was apparently merciless in his demands on her, and at times I think he pushed her into hysterical over-acting during the intense scenes. As with Jack, her portrayal as a flaky housewife is very different from the more strong-willed Wendy of the novel.As expected from Kubrick, the technical aspects of the film are exceptional. The use of Steadicam technology to follow characters through the corridors of the hotel makes the Overlook seem like an endless, claustrophobic maze. Again there is an unsettling use of close-ups, both during the intense scenes and to depict Jack's slow decent into madness. Another technical highlight is the opening overhead sequence of Jack's car approaching the Overlook.Note that, as with all his works, this is very much a Kubrick film first and a genre film second. It is far more intellectual and thought-provoking than most horror, even psychological horror, films. There are plenty of unanswered questions and puzzles by the end, and you get the feeling that Kubrick didn't want everything in the film to fit together too neatly. Some questions seem designed to be open-ended, with no clear answer, but guaranteed to have you discussing the film for a long time afterwards.Those who loved the novel might not be able to forgive the changes Kubrick makes to the story, but the differences in character and plot do not hurt the film. While it may not be the best adaptation of King's book, `The Shining' stands well enough on its own merits.	4.0	"Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"", not Stephen King's...."	2010-02-14	0	0	0

I do like this film. I think it scared me sensless first time I watched it, so top marks  for that. Duvall and Nicholson play so well, both human characters with  their flaws (okay, Jack's a bit more flawed than most). It really drags you  in, the entire claustrophobia of it all, spun against a background of snow  and ice (archetypal good things).I drop it a star purely from  beligerance against the novel adaptation. You cannot enjoy King films once  you've read the books - or at least not to the same extent. Try it if you  haven't - you'll be pleasantly surprised.Oh yeah - one more thing. I  can't watch the 'Here's Jack' bit anymore without seeing Homer Simpson  fluff it three times in 'The Simpsons' version of this - 'The Shinning'  (Quote Bart 'Don't you mean Shining'?

It is more about a guy who just plain old goes under with cabin fever, not  some mystical force horror flick. The adaption from King's master piece was  disappointing.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3FUBUJAIGM87T	"HorrorMan ""HM"""	"All things considered, at least from a horror movie connoisseur's perspective (like myself), Stanley Kubrick's horror masterpiece called ""The Shining"" is probably the scariest movie of all-time. An adaptation of Stephen King's novel also called ""The Shining"", Kubrick tweaks the story in all the right ways to make his movie version even more effective and terrifying than the actual novel itself. The result is a perfect piece of horror cinema in every way imaginable. Kubrick's choice of actors in this movie is absolutely perfect as Jack Nicholson, Danny Lloyd and Shelley Duval all turn in brilliant performances that really bring the terror home to the audience. When viewing ""The Shining"", the viewer gets lost in a world of utter terror on several different yet brilliantly intewoven levels of : isolation, madness, the human psyche specifically its connection to the metaphysical and the world of the supernatural evil itself.The plot of ""The Shining"" is simple and yet highly effective in producing horror. The story begins with Jack Torrance on his way to the Overlook Hotel, an isolated location high in the mountains of Colorado. Torrance, a writer, is on his way to interview for his job as the winter caretaker of the magnificently beautiful Overlook Hotel. Indeed, Torrance impresses his employers and gets the job, but the ominous and absolutely horrifying score associated with this movie produces a dark and morbid theme early in this movie...the audience knows something is not right and that something horrible is about to happen. The interview itself introduces the audience to ""quite a story"" about the former caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, but Jack and his family seem like a normal family except for Danny's disturbing blackout episode early in the movie which acts a precursor and dark forecast for things to come.Jack and his family move to the hotel and Jack begins writing again. All seems well at first...the only thing that resembles anything that could give rise to fear is this horrible sense of isolation that is so inherently associated with the hotel itself...the winters are ""fantastically cruel"" and travel by automobile is impossible during the winter as well as communication by telephone. Except for a snowcat mobile and a CB radio, the family is entirely cut off from any kind of civilization and the only world for Jack and his family is themselves and this huge and yet darkly beautiful hotel they reside in...or maybe not? Gradually, Jack begins a descent into madness as he becomes overwhelmed with a ""cabin fever"" and something much, much more powerful and evil takes a toll on Jack's psyche.Nicholson's performance of a man who is gradually going mad as each day goes by is so powerful that he should have won an oscar for his role in this film...""The Shining"" is a model horror movie that shows the manifestations of a madman so that the audience actually sees it happening before Wendy (Jack's wife) does and this is terrifying in and of itself. The scene where Wendy begins reading Jack's work is one of the most horrifying scenes in all of horror movie history...she realizes that she and her son have been living with a madman for quite some time and have been completely unaware of his degenerative state of mind. Wendy and their little boy Danny are confronted with a horror that is so awful and terrifying that it is simply unspeakable and unimaginable, but Kubrick brings this horror crashing down to reality for the audience and forces the viewer to empathize in Wendy's shoes.It is obvious to the audience that Danny is already a troubled child with a dubious gift that only adds to the eerie atmosphere that Kubrick instills into this glorious piece of horror cinema and this is yet another brilliant and yet terrifying element to this great movie. Danny's troubles involve this amazing psychic ability called by Mr. Halloran (the head chef at the Overlook) ""the shining""...however, ""the shining"" is not just being able to connect with other gifted individuals and being able to see the future, but also being in touch with the past or particular people or places associated with the past and often a dark and disturbing past...such is the case with the Overlook Hotel and Danny is tormented by disturbing images and visions throughout the movie. Danny sees the awful atrocities that occurred over the years at the Overlook Hotel and in a great scene symbolic of not only the past but the very nature of the darkness and sinister element which dominates the Overlook Hotel as Danny sees a gushing flow of blood in the hotel itself which in my humble opinion represents all of the blood spilled at the Overlook Hotel ""over the years"" .In another great scene, Dick Halloran explains to Danny that sometimes things that happen can leave a trace of itself behind, not things anyone can see, but things that people who ""shine"" can see and in the case of the Overlook Hotel, these things are so horrifying that go beyond mere fear of death, but fear of pure evil and a nightmare from which one cannot wake. Indeed, Danny is confronted by ghosts of the past who show him the horrible past of the Overlook and this burden drives Danny into such a state of shock that he creates an alternate personality which is in touch with ""the shining"" to deal with his fear.""The Shining"" is a brilliantly layered horror movie that works in so many different ways to create the ultimate horror viewing experience. True, the supernatural and evil elements present in this movie are horrifying enough and are brilliantly captured and presented by Kubrick and his cast to really bring home actual fear and terror to any sophisticated horror movie audience. Yet, ""The Shining"" would still be scary even if there was no supernatural evil evident in the film...the idea of a woman and her child being isolated and snowbound in a huge hotel with a husband who is obviously losing his mind to go with his already violent temper is enough to make anyone experience the fear that Wendy and her son experience in this film. Just imagine what it would be like to be the mother of a small child suffering from emotional trauma and essentially locked into a hotel possessed by the most sinister force and a husband who completely loses his insanity and becomes a psychotic killer by movie's end...amazing horror.The score associated with ""The Shining"" is one of the greatest horror movie soundtracks or all-time, second only to John Carpenter's ""Halloween"". This darkly and absolutely harrowing score presents theme and mood brilliantly from scene to scene and never lets up on the audience, but actually gets more and more disturbing as the movie progresses. The atmosphere presented by Kubrick in ""The Shining"" is so effective that I would still be scared to watch this film in a strange two story house...the movie is that powerful and that moving for the audience that it actually grips one's heart and mind and never lets go, even after the movie is over, the residual effects of this movie will stay with you for years. Even the landscape, sound effects (a la big wheel over the carpet and hard floors) and the hotel itself create such a dark and morbid image that human fear is the only possible emotion a reasonable person can feel, but while this fear is a treat to lovers of pure horror movies, it can become quite uncomfortable when it is time to turn the lights off and go to sleep.Ladies and gentlemen, I have reviewed many horror movies on Amazon.com and while not necessarily the greatest horror movie of all-time, Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" while certainly one of the greatest, is without a doubt the scariest movie of all-time in my humble opinion. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough to the serious horror movie fan...FIVE STARS does not begin to do this movie justice, but suffice it to say, this is one of the top five greatest horror movies ever made. Anyone who fails to appreciate the merits of this horror movie simply does not like horror movies as ""The Shining"" is emblematic of what a horror movie should aspire to be and is a tribute to the horror movie genre that can be watched over and over again, the horror of which will never quite leave you.P.S. Incidentally, the movie known as ""Stephen King's The Shining"" is absolutely terrible and does not hold a candle to Kubrick's masterpiece...and, I do not care if the newer version more closely resembles King's novel because Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" is superior in every way to both the new miniseries and the novel...PERIOD!!P.P.S.  On a final note, this movie is finally being released as a special edition which is long overdue.  It is my hope that the picture and sound are improved dramatically by this edition.  However, my review is strictly about the brilliance of this masterpiece known as ""The Shining""."	5.0	"""Get him out of here?

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A355WMP0CQBJFX	horrorqueen	the shining is by far one of the best bone chilling movies. so good, so sinister, and jack nicholson is superb. stephen king does it again, what can i say the man is a genius. it doesn't hurt that jack is a great actor either. just goes to show what a little cabin fever, and an evil hotel, in an isolated mountain can do to a person, and a family. what is real what isn't. who can you trust, where do you go when you're all alone? just imagine yourself in a huge hotel, where no one can hear you scream, where no one can find you, where although you're alone, always feel that someone is just right behind you. where things far worse than even your worse nightmares are real. what does it take to make you lose your mind. it's everything about this movie that will make your skin crawl.	4.0	HELL'S HOTEL	2007-08-31	3	0	3

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1KLNYFROE90OV	Howard Tuttleman... howardtuttleman@howardtut...	"Wow. I just got done watching this movie that was recommended to me by a friend. I'm not going to use any new radical styles of reviews for this one. I started a new style of review, but I got interrupted part of the way through, and it RUINED the flow of seeing the movie as it happened. It was a fresh new outlook-review known as the Q-and-A-review, but now it's top-secret and I can't mention it anymore. Anyways, I'll just try to review it in more of a standard-review style, but it will be levelled-up because I'm Howard Tuttleman, and I can do that. Let's review!Okay, there were 3 main-characters in this movie. A dad, a mom, and a smart little-kid. The mom was pretty much just and annoying whiner and cryer and I couldn't relate to her. Reminded me too much of my mom. The other two however, I made a personal connection with them. There were MANY times where I couldn't decide who to side with, because I saw parts of myself in both of them equally.Okay, the kid REALLY reminded me of myself. So much that it was actually a little eerie. Basically, throught the movie he has thought-dreams that he can't explain, and he often goes into terrifying cloud-nightmares because of these visions. He has a power called ""The Shining"" that makes him go through all of this. You see, I too believe that I must have this out-standing power after seeing this movie. Ever since I was a young boy I have seen thing in thought-dreams, and my dad was always mean to me about them, just like in the movie. The meaner my dad got, the worse they would get, and then BAM! I could slip into a cloud-nightmare and go get lost. He writes stuff on the walls just like I always have too. And he loves running around all over the place like me too. He even goes to a Doctor, just like I visit Dr. Bertrand.Now as far as the dad goes, I can relate to the fact that he's not always in control of what he does. He is a writer, much like myself, and he goes on a vacation to a HUGE mansion so he can concentrate more. His family, (mostly his wife) keep bugging him and bugging him and I know what THAT feels like. For example, earlier today:Mom: Barry, where's Howard? Why won't he answer me?Dad: He's just sitting there typing on my computer and watching a movie really loud.Mom: Well go make him stop. It's time for dinner.Me: Wait! Wait! This is really important for my career! If I stop in the middle of my review it will RUIN it! I can never watch this movie for the first time again!Dad: What on earth are you watching?Me: It's called ""The Shining"". It's about this guy who goes crazy and tries to kill his family for bothering him while he's trying to write. Why?Dad: You know, uh....I think were going to have to see Dr. Bertrand more like uh, ONCE a week Howard.Do you see how it goes? So anyways, there is this guy in a dog-costume in the movie that will give me night-mares for the rest of my life. Not just cloud-nightmares either. He just appears for no reason at all. At ALL. At this point in my mind, I can't imagine anything worse than this guy in his dog-costume just being there in my room for NO reason one night. Why does he wear it? Where does he live? And what would he do to you if he caught you!? I shiver at the thought. Hands down, the most horrifying movie-scene EVER to me. It didn't have to be that scary. I'm sure there's a deleted scene somewhere where they tell you all about him and his legend and practices and what-not, like most horror-movies.Another thing about it is that the dad is possessed by evil-spirits that make him do irrational, bad-things. I'm pretty sure that this happens to me all of the time, so the movie wasn't all THAT shocking to me. No one ever believes me, but now I have a point of reference to back this strange phenomenon up with.And I can TOTALLY relate to that persuasive bar-tender that offers him a drink when the dad KNOWS he's not supposed to drink. Now I'm DEFINITELY not talking about alcohol as this relates to me, because I don't drink. What I'm talking about is how people are always like, ""come on Howard, do something crazy with your fire-works."" and I'm like ""No, no guys, I really don't think I should. I might get in trouble or hurt someone."" and they're like ""Come ON Howard! Just this one time, Howard"". ""No, come on guys, cut me some slack, I'm trying to be good lately."" ""HOWARD! Just DO it. If you don't shoot those fire-works at something highly flammable we won't talk to you anymore!"" ""Okay, okay, just this one time guys. Jeez."". And there it goes. I get in trouble.Oh, and there's this great hedge-maze. I would like to grow one of those some day.There's probably a lot of great things I could talk about, but I was interrupted mid-movie, so I'm having thought-errors now that it's later.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1GBMUSQ1GN9QH	H. Shipman	There's not a film made by Kubrick that I didn't like, and this one's at the top of my list--just below 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Whenever he put together any film, the actors weren't the only characters.  His characteristic wide open sets, deliberate pacing, moody soundtracks and sparse dialogue were characters as well.  In this film, they were all integral elements in the narrative.  Nothing went to waste and nothing was overdone.  This is a timeless classic that I never grow tired of seeing.  Similar to a fine wine, it gets better with age.  Turn down the lights, light a few candles and serve chilled.	5.0	One of Kubrick's Best	2013-12-22	0	0	0

I've probably seen it 30 times over the years. The step up from DVD to blu ray is as pronounced as the DVD was from the VHS recording off of television. The picture on this new transfer is stunning. By now I've seen enough HD sources to know that this stands out in the crowd. You can almost reach out and touch the Overlook. It's like you're inside the hotel.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AH1M9A3JTV7C3	Ian Muldoon	Brilliantly made film by Mr Kubrick which gets the viewer in its grip from the opening shot of a little VW bug edging its way up a road on the side of a very large mountainous valley with a stupendous, Wagnerian like intimidating soundtrack of orchestral music.  These litttle people, in their little car, are soon occupying, as caretakers over winter, alone, a huge hotel.  One them, the husband,  goes mad, or perhaps, madder, the child,  starts seeing ghosts, and the third has a nervous breakdown.  A tour de force for Mr Nicholson who lets fly all his acting skills.  Along with Carrie perhaps the best film of  a Stephen King original.  If you willingly suspend disbelief the film can be remarkably unsettling.  One instance is when the wife discovers husband's manuscript he's been working on for some months - it contains just one sentence repeated thousands of times, which Kubrick insisted be typed up by hand for authenticity - the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog  HELPPPP!!!	4.0	the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog!!!!!	2003-10-28	5	2	3

I very proudly love the book and both movies! The book was excellant and this Stanley Kubrick version was very different from the book and there are a lot of things changed and a lot of reviews griped about that but even though I loved the book I still liked this movie despite the changes and I enjoy this movie in it's own right, come on, Jack Nicholson is truly wonderful in this movie, how can anyone not like this movie or his performance? His acting is way over the top but in a fun way that is very entertaining and that is why I bought this DVD.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3EQ61ES6HQ090	"impitbosshereonlevel2 ""impitbosshereonlevel2"""	There are movies with multi-million dollar special effect and makeup budgets that give you a good scare. Then there are movies like Shining, which have very little in the way of special effects, but can scare the bejeezus out of you, with atmosphere alone.Like others have noted, the Shining owes its uniqueness to two things - directing talent of Stanley Kubrick, and the acting talent of Jack Nicholson. It's hard to imagine anyone but Nicholson provide the genuine insanity of Jack Torrance. Coupled with exquisite cinematic talent of Kubrick, the scenes of The Shining are far more realistic and horrifying than any amount of special effects could achieve. Music alone can easily make the hairs on your neck stand up.Again, I largely credit Kubrick with the success of the Shining, not Stephen King, whose other book-based films are generally forgettable, if not often silly (Dreamcatcher and It, anyone?) It may also interest you to know that King himself dislikes this version of the book, and has often stated so (perhaps not too surprising).	5.0	Great party, isn't it?	2006-02-13	3	3	0

The hotel is totally empty (except for the family)  and very quiet, but sometimes there are a lot of people, dancing and  drinking. These imaginations are worked out really good.

In my opinion, it is the masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick's career and it displays Jack Nicholson in one of his most memorable and defining roles.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3B9BMW8RK2DMX	Jagrot	This was a spectacular piece of work. It had a chilling soundtrack, and had some very good camera work. In the case of the Shining, a movie has finally exceeded the book upon which it was based. Things that would normally make a movie terrible have made the Shining a spellbinding movie. For example, the dialogue throughout the entire movie seems forced and unnatural. Another example is during an argument between Jack Nicholson (who performs incredibly well throughout the entire movie) and Shelley Duvall, after which Jack storms out of the room and glances at the camera as he goes by. If you're a horror fan, or just into movies, this is definetely one to see again and again and again.	5.0	Possibly the Best Horror Movie Ever	2003-08-12	16	12	4
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A38ZLPBKB5ITTP	JAK	None of us would want to know what it is really like to go mad.  There are some exceptional sequences in this film.  There is a palpable sense of isolation, and Nicholson is particularly strong in the early and middle parts of the film when he is just starting to lose his mind, but is desperately trying to maintain his sanity, amidst the undercurrent of child abuse.  I don't want to know whether this is what it is like to go insane, but it sure convinced me.  There is a quiet scene when he asks his son to sit on his lap that is masterful in its understatement.  There is another scene in which Nicholson is on the verge of tears because it seems like he understands that he is actually losing his mind.  The parts of the film toward the end after Nicholson has gone completely mad and is on a rampage seem far less effective to me then the earlier parts of the film.  There are a lot of exceptional extras on this disc as well.	5.0	Descent into madness	2011-03-15	2	1	1

Anyone who has seen this film both in the theater as well as on video can attest.  It is the video version that has been cropped!  Movie screens have not been constructed for the 1.3 ratio since the fifties!  Try to understand how that works as far as projection goes.  Trying to project a film shot in 1.3 aspect ratio onto a screen formatted for 1.6 will result in either black bars on either side of the screen or missing footage on the top and bottom of it.  And anyone who believes that Kubrick shot ANY of his films with the intent that they should be viewed on television first and foremost is crazy!!!

I own the 4:3 aspect ratio DVD release, and have seen the 2007 release on DVD too.  The BD version is by far, the best version released even if the aspect ratio is not 4:3.  The audio and video is the clearest ever.  Since Kubrick's movies are highly visual experiences, the better the video and audio, the better the movie is too.  The clarity of BD immerses you in the experience, as if you too were there.  Kubrick's legendary attention to detail is even more appreciated in high resolution, as the grandeur of the Hotel, the exquisite details including the actor's faces and responses, jump out even more than the theatrical release.  There are no audio option settings on the disk but it plays like stereo only, not surround or 5.1.  In the extras in the disk, mention is made of 'restoration', but I don't recall if it referred to the 2007 release, or to the BD release.	5.0	Shining on blu-ray, Best Ever	2009-08-14	2	1	1

I never liked this movie when I was young because I had no idea why so much of it seemed to be saying something, but not in an intelligible way.If you have only a vague idea what kinds of symbolism Kubrick may have intended (no, it isn't simply about native Americans or the Holocaust), watch the documentary Room 237, then watch this movie. I think several of the commentators in Room 237 are nuts and just plain wrong about what Kubrick intended, but the documentary is a very useful primer on many of the layers of symbolism Kubrick used.I find that the older I get, the more I understand The Shining and the more I appreciate it.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3LLDA6T3OG3LP	Jason Brennan	This is my favorite Kubrick film to watch because it is his most  &quot;extreme&quot;- in language, violence, and subject matter.What makes  this movie so much better than all other war movies is the fact that it  doesnt concentrate on one facet of war, such as a battle, man or mission.  It focuses on the complete process of dehumanization of men in war.From  drilling it into their heads in basic training, to &quot;pacifist&quot;  Joker wasting the sniper, and thus, completing the process.Kubrick really  seems to capture the essence of men in the Vietnam War. Commanders only  intent on creating killing machines, soldiers simply killing for amusement,  and no one thinking of the consequences for anyone. I've read a lot of  criticism of the second half of this movie-the battle scenes-for being  boring(compared to the first half) and unrealistic. I feel I must point out  that the first half is so savagely brutal that the revelation of the  meaning of life would probably  be a letdown. As for it being unrealistic,  Vietnam is not just one big jungle, and war is not made up simply of planes  flying overhead and bombs being dropped. These scenes, I feel, capture the  isolation and  sense of terror  in being in a situation in which you have  little or no control, and can be killed at any moment.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3NESOQDJGMM45	"Jason Buckmaster ""hero_of_cybertron"""	First off, If you've read the book YES the movie left a lot out, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  This movie is already 2 and a half hours and if they would've made it just like the book you'd be watching a 5 hour movie.Jack Nicholson is at his best here.  He is the main reason why this movie is so great.  He is psychotic right from the beginning of the movie.  The way his eyebrows curl up and he gets that sinister grin on his face.  The hotel is simply what drives him over the edge.  There are some especially frightening scenes in this movie including the bathtub scene, the scene in the ballroom's bathroom, and the scene where Wendy reads Jack's writing/story.  The only part I don't get is why Jack turns on his own son?  It's obvious why he wants to murder his wife, but he does seem to truly care for his son.  Anyway buy this movie right now if you want a really scary horror film.  Gore is at a minimum as is the body count.  It's not a slasher flick.  It's scary on a much higher level.	5.0	The best horror movie ever.	2002-10-29	3	1	2

This much is true: You won't ever want to stay in the real-life hotels again! The Stanley in Estes Park, Colorado, which inspired King while he was here in Colorado, or Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood, Oregon, which provided the exterior shots.In Mick Martin's movie guide, this is one of the few for which ""his"" review (admittedly, many of the reviews in the book are compiled from trusted reviewers) disagrees with my own in a big way. Specifically, he alleges that Nicholson's performance ""approaches high camp"" and that the movie itself is slow.I, on the other hand, appreciate the slow burn and feel it gives us time to watch Jack Torrance slip (back?) into insanity. I've never been a huge fan of Shelley Duvall but each time I watch this I appreciate how she nailed the helpless wife/mother. Scatman Crothers (head chef and fellow ""Shiner"") is great.Taking one star away for the deplorable lack of extras, although I imagine they've corrected that on the newer (Blu-ray?) release."	4.0	Stephen King is wrong: this movie is great	2009-09-07	3	2	1

(ride around the hotel on a big wheel) .or get lost in the maze.  so when jack finnlly reaches the point that he loves this place better than his family because she wants to leave he snaps...heres johnny......one important scean that jack says when he talks to shelly on the bed about .she had her whole life to figure things out.(just like the scean in eyes wide shut)you might get the vibe that he is really talking about himself,that he feels kind of worthless and needs something to belong to..(maybe the hotel is his escape) so of course this movie is really not about everything i have just said but it is really another way of looking at it.being a more politicaly incorrect way .which is some thing that stanley was known for.  so at the ending of the film when the camera goes to a picture of jack with the date july 4th.that to me only thinks that this was jacks independance day.he has always been there because he has wanted to be something not the bad father he was or the alcoholic.but a creative writer a man that could be the center of attention.....so you decide horror or a journey into the relems of the disfuntional family.......seeing how kubricks other movies EYES WIDE SHUT , LOLIDA, A CLOCK WORK ORANGE AND BARRY LYNDON .had those themes there must be a link????	5.0	watch the shining again with my insite of how i see it...	2002-06-22	5	3	2

Transfer quality is firmly  &quot;average&quot;. And another strange item: the closing credits are not  the ones from theatrical print: they are white instead of blue, much  larger, and appear on screen out of sync with the music.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2CEX7784M8YSU	Jeffery Bauman	"The Shining is one of those horror films that can consider itself a masterpiece of screen horror.  Many people have complained on how long the film takes to build, but I fing the wait worthwhile for the terror later to come.  The direction by Stanley Kubric is excellent with his dream like tracking shots of the Overlook hotel.  Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd all give excellent performances as the winter caretakers of the Overlook hotel.  The film is nearly perfect.  Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the DVD.Movie: The Torrence family is selected as the winter caretakers of the Overlook hotel.  Danny (Lloyd) has a special gift called ""Shining,"" hence the film's title.  This means he can see things before they happen.  Danny is able to somewhat able to see that his father, Jack,(Nicholson) will eventually go mad, and try to kill him and Jacks' wife, Wendy. (Duvall)  From here the suspense builds and builds until the finale.  An epic horror film in the truest sense of the word.  (5/5)DVD:Picture: Nearly horrible.  Grain, fuzziness, and dirt can always be spotted.  Film also shows wear.  It's obvious that there was no remaster for this studio release.  I watched the film on the cable channel FX recently, and the picture quality there looked like a masterpiece compared to what is presented here.  Warner Bros. should have taken at least some care in releasing this film on DVD.  The film is presented full frame.  I prefer widescreen, but if that's the way Kudrick wanted us to see it, then that's fine with me.  (2/5)Sound:  Not as bad as the picture.  The only option here is the original mono soundtrack.  Dialoge sounds natural, but occassionally thin.  Music has a commanding precsense.  Not a bad audio presentation, but nothing to get excited about.  A 5.1 soundtrack would have been greatly appreciated.  (3/5)Extras: There is a very funny and interesting documentary on the making of the film.  This was shot while the film was being shot.  The trailer is also included.  (4/5)Overall:  A truly excellent film, but a mediocre DVD.  A special edition will hopefully be in the works.Overall Grade: (3.5/5)  5 star rating is for the movie itself."	5.0	The Shining DVD Review	2002-10-30	2	0	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3Q6TBXAHLJJ0Q	jeff Gates	Ok I watched this movie like half a month ago or so for the first time.  I watched it at like at midnight with one of my friend's and I was scared even though much doesn't scare me in the line of movies.  I haven't seen the exorcist before, I hear that's very scary, but to me this is the scariest that I have seen.  It's maybe slow for like a half hour maybe 40 minutes, but that is when it's preparing the story and then it gets really scary.  Although not much killing and there is hardly any blood, they are pretty much quick glimpses of mutilated corpses, but the quick glimpses are gory.  But anyhow this is a movie that doesn't require showing you a body getting ripped inside out for a minute to scare you.  The roles are perfect and this movie had me the entire time.  If you thought Halloween or something like that was scary or no movies can scare you, grab this, and if you've got a lot of guts then watch it alone at night, although I watched it at night with a friend.  Although it is probably more fun with a friend.  Try this.  Unless you don't like getting scared then this is for you.  It will probably be disturbing for you though for the rest of the night definately atleast.	5.0	The Scariest Movie	2002-09-10	1	0	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2V3P1XE33NYC3	Jeffrey Leach	"Love it or hate it, the horror genre never felt the same after Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining."" Adapted, as we all know, from a Stephen King book of the same name, the legendary director of such classics as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Barry Lyndon"" created a picture here that leaves a chill running down your spine long after the credits roll. Too bad King never liked the picture. It's been well documented in the intervening years how the author blamed Kubrick for fundamentally altering his vision. I saw somewhere that King believed that Stanley Kubrick thought his novel was inferior material that needed to be elevated on celluloid. Well, everyone has an opinion. For my part, I don't think Kubrick thought it an unfavorable book even though it is. I read ""The Shining"" and really didn't care for it that much. It is, in fact, one of my least favorite Stephen King novels. Only ""Cujo"" ranks lower--and in that case the film version didn't ride to the rescue. King is a great novelist capable of producing fine work, but long after he is gone people will forget his novel and remember Kubrick's translation. Of course I could be completely wrong, but I don't think so.The film opens with the Torrance family--father Jack (Jack Nicholson), mother Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and precocious son Danny (Danny Lloyd)--driving out to the Overlook hotel for the winter. Jack took a job there as the winter caretaker, a big task considering the resort sits high up in the mountains where heavy snowfall virtually assures his family will be snowed in for months. A struggling writer and recovering alcoholic, Jack sees this opportunity as a great way to churn out a novel. It's not as though he has much else to do in the hotel: there aren't any guests loafing about and the staff isn't around to hassle him. All he's got to do is keep the lights and heat on, call in to a ranger station on the radio every few days, and he can sit back and collect a paycheck. Problem is, spending five months cooped up in a hotel in the mountains can bring on a powerful case of cabin fever resulting in...well...bizarre behavior. It happened before at the Overlook, actually, as Jack learns during his job interview with the manager of the hotel. One previous caretaker took an axe and slaughtered his entire family. Fun! Jack doesn't think such a gruesome event will present any problems for him or his family.Boy, is he mistaken! Jack Torrance has absolutely no idea of the supernatural horrors that lurk in the bowels of the Overlook hotel, but his son Danny does. It seems Danny has the ability to ""shine,"" or read people's thoughts and see things that the rest of us don't see. And what he'll see at the Overlook hotel would give the stoutest among us a massive coronary. Suicides from years past, rivers of blood pouring out of the elevators, and the deceased daughters of the aforementioned caretaker appear as if by magic in front of the terrified Danny. One of the worst horrors resides in room 237, a room a departing employee named Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) tells Danny to avoid like the plague. Hallorann has the ability to shine as well, and is fully cognizant of the powers the Overlook can unleash with ease. As the days turn into weeks, Jack descends into total insanity, terrorizing his stricken wife and son even as he falls under the spell of the spirits in the hotel. There's no sense in dragging this out except to say that the movie unfolds like a relentless, evil dream. ""The Shining"" isn't so much a film as it is an experience to savor--for those who can stand the terror, that is.Goodness, where to start! The movie fires on every cylinder. Jack Nicholson is sublime as the mentally unbalanced Jack Torrance, capable of menacing subtlety and raging insanity at the drop of a hat. His line ""Hereeee's Johnny"" is arguably one of the best-known movie quotes in the history of cinema. Those who hate the film usually cite Shelley Duvall as the primary reason, claiming her whiny and weak personality mars an otherwise acceptable film. Horse hockey. Duvall is supposed to be in a fragile state largely because of her husband's past history and her concern about her son's odd psychic abilities. And when she sees her family falling apart again, she cracks under the pressure. I think she did fine. As amazing as the performances are, however, they pale in comparison to the look and feel of the film. ""The Shining"" is a cold, detached movie like most other Kubrick films. The dread is a palpable presence in every single frame of the movie, whether we're following Danny's big wheel through the halls of the hotel or watching Jack converse with evil spirits. So many great scenes rise to the forefront of my memory as I write: the chase through the maze, that last soul shattering shot of Jack Torrance, and Wendy's discovery of ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" all exquisitely torture the audience. This is a frightening film, and its one that never loses its impact with subsequent viewings.The DVD? Surprisingly, we don't get much. The picture quality is quite good, as it should be for a Kubrick film, but extras are lacking. A lengthy documentary about the making of the film with commentary from Kubrick's daughter Vivian does help, yet I can't help but wish for more. I could go on and on about how wonderful a find ""The Shining"" is for the horror fan, but you probably already know all about this film. If you are one of the roughly five people in the world who haven't seen the movie, I pity you. Get out and see it now!"	5.0	Redrum! Redruuuum!	2005-04-13	62	48	14
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	"During the period of the late 70s and early 80s, several slasher horror movies were released, such as Friday the 13th, but The Shining generates its horror through psychological means which keeps the viewer guessing throughout the movie.Using a script based on the novel by Stephen King, director Stanley  Kubrick has created a story with menacing settings and excellent performances by Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd.  Nicholson stars as Jack Torrance, who's come to the Overlook Hotel as the off-season caretaker.  Duvall plays his wife Wendy, and Lloyd stars as the Torrance's son Danny.At his interview, Jack is told about a former caretaker named Delbert Grady, who murdered his wife and two daughters.  Soon, Jack is experiencing his own psychological changes.  The Overlook soon becomes Jack's personal playground of terror as Wendy and Danny are forced to fight for their lives against Jack.  Will they survive, or will Jack succeed in killing them as Delbert Grady did to his family?This is an excellent movie.  Nicholson's performance is first-rate, and his ""Here's Johnny!"" line has become legendary.  Shelley Duvall does a fine job as the scared wife, and Danny Lloyd's performance of Danny, who has psychological powers, is very good as well.  I highly recommend this thrilling and scary film.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AWSCX4C0JA8D9	Jerad Walters	"Kubrick's The Shining has its detractors and admirers, especially among those who feel that the film is a celluloid masterpiece and the book is pulp garbage; or those who feel the film is pretentious and self-absorbed and the book is classic literature. I'm a fan of both of them.Kubrick is more interested in creating a sense of claustrophobia and slowly looming menacing than in creating three-dimensional characters and seen as a mood piece, The Shining is pretty hard to surpass. This is due to the camera shots (many from a child's point of view), the title cards that lose all meaning, and Kubrick's brilliant use of the music of Ligeti, Bartok and Penderecki.The acting is, to me, excellent, especially Shelley Duvall and Nicholson. Danny Lloyd is good, too, and Scatman Crothers turns in a memorable performance. The technical aspects of the film are superb, especially Danny's Big Wheel sound as he goes onto carpet/hardwood/carpet, etc. What always gets me is how Stuart Ullman calls the former caretaker ""Charles Grady"" and Jack calls him ""Delbert Grady."" Anyone got a reasonable answer for this?A few things that people always complain about: first, Scatman Crothers getting killed. Many people feel that it is a waste of his character that he dies once entering the hotel after his journey up the mountain. This has a great effect, however, in that you know that Kubrick will kill a character at any time (King had Jack wield a roque mallet rather than an axe, which allowed King to beat up his main characters pretty badly without killing them). I mean, he has to go out killing at least one person, right?Finally, people love to complain about what a wimp Wendy is in this picture. I think she's the hero of the movie. She deals with all of the day to day operations of the hotel: cooking for the family, running the boiler, communicating with the outside world. When Jack starts verbally abusing her, she still hangs in there, even after he confesses his murderous dream. Faced with all of the daily operations of the hotel, she then has to deal with a psychotic husband, a potential murderous crazy woman in the hotel (Jack could care less), and a beloved son descending into catatonia. Despite this, she still manages to whack Jack with the baseball bat (a tremendous act of courage) and lock him into dry storage and then somehow deals with him getting out and hunting her down in her bathroom, going crazy with the axe. Even then she has enough sense to defend herself. Kudos to Wendy, one of the most unsung heroines in all of horror films!"	5.0	"still a ""masterpiece of modern horror"""	2005-10-26	5	3	2

In 1980, the film wasn't a commercial success and was also very difficult to produce ( fire on the set, Kubrick's high number of takes, Shelly Duvall's illness). However, the film is now considered a true classic horror film. It is a must-see film in all aspects: the story (based loosely on Stephen King's book), the photography (with use of the stedi-cam), the acting and finally the music.(The music is extremely haunting)The special features found on the second disc are excellent, as they provide not only a ""making of"" documentary made by Kubrick's daughter, but also other interviews and insights about the making of the film.

Unlike that other film, The Shining was from the start in for a substantial makeover, in this case by Stanley Kubrick and his co-screenwriter Diane Johnson.  For this reason, the film has never really pleased many fans of the original book who believe that films must be faithfully and accurately transcribed to screen in order to be considered a successful adaptation.Watching The Shining today, what strikes one are the uncommonly elegant sets, the lack of special effects (one trick shot of the hedge maze notwithstanding), the gliding Steadicam cinematography and the tricky tone the film manages to maintain between horror film, domestic drama and very black comedy.  There are scenes in the film that never fail to make me laugh and others that give one the appropriate creepy frisson expected of a horror film.The film takes a distinctly more psychological approach than the novel.  While the hotel does appear to be truly haunted in the film (Danny sees ghosts, Jack appears in the portrait in the final shot, etc.), it's also possible to read all of the scenes between Jack and Lloyd (the bartender) or the Grady (the former caretaker) as the delusions of an alcoholic having a breakdown.  Certainly, the subtext is at the very least made quite clear.  Oddly, the one scene in the film that I recall making clear beyond question that the supernatural is at work (when the ghost of Grady opens the storage locker door to release Jack) is actually ambivalent.  Jack speaks to Grady through the door and we simply hear the door being unlocked while the camera remains on Jack's face...the next time we see him he is hacking away at the bedroom door with an Axe. Perhaps he used the ax to bust open the locker door himself?  In any event, Nicholson is great in the film, perhaps his finest performance.The Blu-ray is (as expected) notably crisper looking than earlier DVD's.  There is some grain evident and the colors don't quite ""pop"" in the same way that they do for some more recent films but this is undoubtedly the best The Shining has ever looked on video.  Considering this is one of the best photographed films of it's period, I think most people will be pleased with the picture."	5.0	The Shining -  classic horror	2008-09-08	2	1	1

However I did not get the pleasure of seeing Jack Nickelson in one of his best performances until my Freshman year in college. Coincidently I saw it the night before I went to the Stanley Hotel (where the hotel was loosely based off of, here in Colorado.The movie very much screams 70s style and horror, with scary movie, and scary clothes from the 70s. But Jack does such a great job as a reformed dad who goes crazy while trying to write the great American novel as his wife and son help him babysit an abandoned hotel, vacant for the winter. You feel enough for the characters that you drawn into each of them, thereby scaring you and making you feel for them that much more.THis is a movie that I will time and time again watch.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1MMKUAZAKL395	Jevron Mc Crory	Let's put this as simply as possible : The Shining, is without a doubt, a film I'm quite literally obsessed with. In all of my twenty three years, nothing I've seen since has affected me quite so deeply as Stanley Kubrick's masterful retelling of Stephen King's little tale about a family, a hotel and a force of pure evil. Forget the book, the film snakes it's way inside your brain and locks you in with The Torrances for it's murderously tense two and a half hour running time. Considered by some (including me) to be the scariest film ever made, noting it's qualities would take up this entire web site. I won't bore you with scrawling out here the plot and themes explored in the movie, I simply urge that if at present, you are yet to view The Shining, waste not another night. Draw the curtains, load up the DVD, pull a chair into the centre of the room and go on a guided tour into the Overlook Hotel.

But, now that i'm able to mentally segregate the film from the book, this is a classic horror film with a terrific DVD transfer that I saw last night. As for the movie, simply take a recovering alcoholic prone to visions and flashbacks (Nicholson), pair him with a son who's got many problems himself despite psychiatric reassurances(Lloyd) and bundle this up with a sane mother who looks insane(Duvall))and you've got all the ingredients for a winning tri-fecta at sea level. Add a secluded mountaintop hotel with a notorious past  that this trio will inhabit alone for the next six months, and you have all that you really need to know.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1X1CEGHTHMBL1	jjceo	This movie is one of the best films ever made that is based on a Stephen King book.  Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) takes a job as the caretaker of a hotel/resort high in the Rocky Mountains.  He takes his wife Wendy (Shelley Duval) and his young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) with him and they will be isolated for the entire winter as the place is literally snowed in for months.  It is an undemanding job as there really is not a lot to do and they get free room and board for the entire stay.  Jack is going to use the time to write a book he has in mind.Danny is a special child as he has telepathy and premonitions of the future.  He is shocked when the hotel's cook who is giving them their introductory tour speaks to him telepathically.  The cook (Scatman Crothers) has his ability from his grandmother and that she called it the shining.  He tells Danny that he has it also.  Danny tells him that the hotel is scary and that it has its own shine.  He tells Danny to be careful and to stay out of room 237.A major winter snow storm hits and now they are truly isolated.  Unfortunately the hotel has an evil history and evil spirits abound there.  Jack is slowly driven crazy and possessed by the former caretaker that murdered his family.......This movie and book is just downright scary and creepy.  There are some scenes in the movie that are very graphic and macabre. I love horror stories and movies and this one is just outstanding.  It is really a classic Stephen King story that was transformed to the movie screen with a wonderful cast and great directing.  I recommend it to you.	5.0	Freaky scary!	2012-07-28	3	3	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A8F2AZWB20X1H	JLind555	Stephen King's books have usually made a transition to the screen ranging from so-so to god-awful, but in &quot;The Shining&quot;, Stanley Kubrick has made a movie that is actually better than the book.  It's tight, spare, lean, mean, and spooky as hell.  From the marvelous opening, of a lone Beetle making its way up a spectacularly beautiful and utterly empty mountainous terrain, we get a sense of the crushing loneliness and isolation that eventually drives the film's protagonist over the edge, coupled with his out-of-control alcoholism.  Jack Nicholson is a diabolical presence as Jack Torrance, the frustrated playwright who takes an off-season job as caretaker of a once-glamorous hotel gone slightly to seed; after being kicked out of his teaching position at a posh prep school, it's the only job he can find to support his clueless wife and his five year old son Danny.  Danny has the &quot;shine&quot; on him, which means he has the gift of Sight, and he is able to see, as neither of his parents can, the ghastly doings that have haunted the old hotel where he and his family are trapped for the long winter.  Jack's descent into madness and his wife's growing panic are wonderfully portrayed in the film.  Probably nobody else could have played this part as effectively as Nicholson; with his peaked eyebrows and sardonic, twisted grin, he even looks devilish.  Shelly Duvall as his wife overdoes the shaking and quaking in some scenes, but she is very good as the wife who just wants to protect their son and get them both out of this possessed hellhole alive.  The only disappointment in the film was the diminished role of the cook Hallorann, who understands Danny's gift because he shares it; although Scatman Crothers was very good indeed in this part, we saw much more of him in the book and we should have seen more of him in the movie.  The cinematography and the music are both excellent and effectively contribute to the film's atmosphere of haunting isolation and insulation.  King must have been glad when he saw this movie that at least one of his books came out right on film.	5.0	For once, Hollywood does it right	2002-04-03	3	3	0

One of the greatest movie moments is in this when the cook goes to save the family.  I won't give it away but it is brilliant.  I heard that Stephen King was dissapointed in the movie but I can't see why.  It is by far the greatest addaption that any of his books has ever gone through.

The ""Horror"" angle of the story isn't very interesting to me, just another typical Stephen King story. However Kubrick manages to create unique atmosphere, haunting and chilly, which slowly builds up through his slow and hypnotic shots of the house. The giant mansion is the real hero of the film. Kubrick shapes the house with odd colors and lightings, much like in clockwork orange, but where in Clockwork orange it was a mere quirky abstraction here it manages to reflect the inner moods of the main character- ""All work and no play"" loony Jack Nicholson, and propels the atmosphere of insanity slowly building.(Notice the use of lighting- throughout the movie there always some kind of strong light in the center of the screen, making an effect of surrealism.)It's also Jack Nicholson greatest performance, and there's a lot of humor in his amusing insane expressions.This movie shows that Kubrick's odd choice at making a horror film wasn't in vain, and might be his greatest achievement, especially in terms of visuals.""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy""."	5.0	"Possibly the most ""Kubrick""ian of his films ."	2004-11-21	2	0	2

Nicholson is a marvel to watch as his character evolves from a slightly odd but functioning adult to raving psychopath. Scatman Crothers is also memorable as the hotel's only other resident.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AR92Z6CO5KQTF	"""johnh68"""	If you own the earlier DVD of &quot;The Shining&quot;, trash (or sell) it; this is the definitive version. Completely remastered from the original negative, the image is incredibly smooth and free of the analog noise and dirt, grain, etc., that plagued the sorry earlier effort (taken from the same aged master used to strike the old VHS and Laserdisc editions). The image is unbelievably pristine, considering Kubrick's fondness for &quot;pushing&quot; the film stock, usually resulting in a bit more grain than usual. This is a wonderful picture, and Kubrick, were he still alive, certainly would have approved. Added to this is the terrific new 5.1 sound mix; subtle, but giving the film a newfound, creepy edge (something the old mono-only soundtrack simply couldn't do) and enhancing the jarring musical cues and overall atmosphere of extreme disquiet. As for the issue of widescreen - particularly another reviewer's ill-informed and naive statement that no DVD is worth owning unless it is in widescreen - Kubrick did not shoot any of his films (with the exceptions of &quot;Spartacus&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;) in scope; all were shot &quot;full frame&quot; and  &quot;soft&quot; matted for theatrical display. In short, you're seeing all (if not more, since the theater matting chopped off the top and bottom) of the image Kubrick composed in-camera. Warner's deserves high kudos for these fine remasters of Kubrick's films.	5.0	&quot;Wendy....I'm home!!!&quot;	2001-07-12	6	6	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1F6DHVFE1ZIXX	John	"In an introduction to a new edition of Stephen King's book, The Shining, he says that he reached a point while writing the book where he could leave the main character as just an every day crazy villian, or he could go deeper, and create someone who was not only driven insane by the ghosts of the hotel, but by his past (pariticularly his father, and memories of certain things he did while he was drunk-read the book for specifics).  Not only would he be DRIVEN to kill, he would start to WANT to kill.  Mr. King did decide to go deeper, and the result is one of the best books around.  Unfortunately, Mr. Kubrick decided not to go deeper.  In the movie, Jack Nicholson plays a guy who is insane from the get-go.  Nothing really interesting about his character really, but it provides for some cool movie lines.I'm not saying that this is a horrible movie, though.  As evidenced by my four star rating, I think this is a pretty good movie.  It definately is scary, using kind of subliminal images (flashing the dead twin little girl ghosts on the screen) much like The Exorcist, to provide an air of real spookiness that will have you looking over your shoulder if you watch this alone at night, to make sure there isn't a ghost behind you or something.However, Kubrick could have elevated this to the rank of a classic.  In the book, the main character slowly is driven mad by the hotel.  He doesn't just go nuts, though.  He fights (not literally-in his head) the influence of the hotel.  He actually has times where he comes out of the trance it has him in, usually after he does something he normally wouldn't do, like hitting his son-and he thinks to himself ""What the hell did I just do?"".  He also kind of redeems himself in the end.  The book also has some great sequences that would have been great in the movie.  Like the whole thing with the hedge animals.  I read that part and was totally freaked out.  I jumped when I heard my heater kick on!  It also included the boiler which needed to have the steam knocked down everyday, or else it would explode.  There are just so many elements of the book that could have made this movie into a masterpiece!  What was Stanley thinking?!Anyway, enough of my b#tching.  This was a very entertaining movie, and it held my interest throughout.  It definately can be watched over and over again without becoming boring.  A great effort by Kubrick, but he could have made it a sensational effort (there I go again...I just can't seem to stop my p*ssing and moaning about this).  I highly reccommend that you see it, and on second thought, I think the title of my review is a little harsh, but it is a cool title and I like it too much to change it.

Maybe some people find those little girls disturbing or the gallons of blood but if you don't where else can you go?The atmosphere was more institutional feeling than frightening and that silly voice repeating ""redrum"" ( an asinine devise old as the hills - spelling a key word backwards ) actually made me laugh.If you're thinking of seeing this on the strength of Kubricks name I suppose there'll be no stopping you but think Barry Lyndon not Clcokwork Orange.If your a Stephen King fan you'll love it - it's a total bore."	2.0	SHINING IS DULL	2004-02-25	14	7	7

This hotel was once build on a ancient Indian burial ground and long ago, a family who did a similar job to Jack's at the Overlook Hotel but the father went insane as he butchered his family to pieces. The hotel is haunted by spirits from the past that have come to haunt the family and make Jack go insane with madness as he falls off the edge to insanity.An epic supernatural horror thriller shocker from Stanley Kubrick is a very loose adaptation of the timeless novel from Stephen King which he said that he disliked this movie version. It's a surreal and nightmarish film about madness and supernatural with great acting by the cast especially Scatman Crothers who plays the lovable chef, the music score by Wendy Carlos is chilling for particular and the whole film is atmospheric. I also like how they use special camera tricks and high tension for the film, sure it almost nowhere near the novel but this is a classic horror movie that will remain a masterpiece.This Blu-Ray gives the movie a perfect look with sharp crystal clear picture and awesome CD-quality sound with interactive extras like audio comemntary, ""The Making of the Shining"" with optional commentary, theatrical trailer and three new featurettes."	5.0	A masterpiece of the macabre done wonderfully on Blu-Ray.	2008-05-24	3	1	2

The sound quality sucked! I had to turn my dolby digital surround system all the way  up, which under normal circumstances would get myself evicted from the  premises. With the volume all the way up I still had problems making out  some of the text.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A23VGBG17K5NJ3	John Nolley II	Stephen King's novel The Shining is a classic of modern horror and one of the author's best and scariest works.  The film  version of the tale may be more a product of Kubrick than King, but it is in its own way a good psychological thriller.Whereas the novel encompasses far more of the supernatural nature of the Overlook Hotel's ghostly and evil residents, the film instead chooses to see Jack Nicholson's descent into madness as just that rather than largely the product of phantasmal touches.  Nicholson's performance is masterful in only the way he can deliver such a role; one might really wonder if he ought to be in a straight jacket at times.Purists and fans of the novel might resent Kubrick's reinterpretation of King's novel--and the film is indeed the lesser of the two in comparison--yet still the Shining on video is a shocker to terrify and thrill and a requisite title in any fan's video library.	4.0	Good Film Adaptation that Stands On Its Own	2003-09-25	0	0	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1UI2N2LBGVKC7	"Johnny S Geddes ""OC"""	There are two ways to approach 'The Shining' for critical analysis. It can be treated either as a free-standing thriller or as a generic Kubrick work. Either way, it's effectively lensed thanks to Kubrick's rigid and  cerebrally born camera technique. Visually, the movie is a brick-by-brick  reconstruction of Stephen King's novel. Kubrick wastes no footage in  ensuring that there's a nice long runway built for his monster. The only  problem is that his movie, for all its exhaustive detail, just can't get  off the ground.This is almost entirely due to Stanley  Kubrick's failure to transplant the essence of the work from King's book. A  thinking man who was firmly grounded in the here and now and whose cold  calculatedness always came through on his lens, Kubrick really did choose  the wrong book to work with. His film blueprint hadn't altered since '2001  - A Space Odyssey' and its exactly according to this schema that he  constructed 'The Shining'. His filming is sincere and milks each set and  sequence to the limit; it's just that there's no spirit world for Kubrick,  no capacity to consider the supremacy of inference and suggestion over  direct representation. From start to finish, 'The Shining' is heavily  imbued with images that can be taken at face value and dialogue scenes that  sometimes seem perfunctory and even a little 'uninspired'.A  problem arises in Kubrick's method of suspense build up and the  precipitation of his action sequences. Everything makes sense and works  like clockwork (excusing the pun on one of his best films) but there's  never any orchestration made toward injecting occult and supernatural  terror into the mix beyond much beyond that which is halluncinatory. The  violence, when it finally does come, is neat and graphic and is one of 'The  Shining's strongest elements as a movie. The suspense, however, doesn't  come off the way it happens in the book and that's what's really wrong  here. Owing directly to the blatant idiosyncratic differences between  Kubrick and King, a fair portion of the potential for terror is lost in the  gulf that separates the story's writer's and its film director's  personalities.The casting presents mild difficulties also.  Shelley Duvall is excellent as Mrs Torrance only in the climactic scenes  near and at the movie's conclusion. Elsewhere, however,  she's just a  quivering heap of jangled nerves and her character's personal weaknesses  seem exaggerated at times, almost to the extent of self parody.Jack Nicholson works in the role of Torrance as as much as he doesn't. King  purists, naturally, are inclined to leap in to join the attack on his  selection for the part, citing blindly that he's messed up from the start  of the picture or that he's too fresh from 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's  Nest' to be anything other that a crazy man. Nicholson actually portrays  Torrance accurately here: he's burnt out (hence the mild symptoms of lunacy  right from the beginning) and is a feather-trigger alcoholic. Sure; his  performance makes for some problems as the viewer will find it hard to  witness the psychological disintegration of his character from sequence to  sequence. Looking back, though, the would-be critic should entertain one  notion very carefully before frowning on Nicholson: could any other  prominent actor of the era have carried off the role without sacrificing  some other aspect of Mr. Torrance? That may sound frivilous and academic  until one cringes from the thought of Michael Caine in the part. All things  considered, by the movie's action-packed conclusion, Nicholson has thrown  his gears quite visibly and he goes wonderfully berserk. His rampage is, in  fact, far more appreciable and close to the Stephen King idea than has been  given credit.It's a long movie at two and a half hours but  then it was a long novel. There are many things at this director's disposal  and he uses them to the full. Exquisite sets, staggering images and high  grade (though far from perfect) casting all work in his favour on this  assignment. Unfortunately, the result is a seamless Frankenstein monster  lying still and lifeless on its slab in the laboratory. Kubrick's atheistic  outlook just can't give it the all essential spark.'The  Shining' receives four stars by way of mean averaging. Five stars would  definitely do it justice for its looks and fine cinematic veneer; four  would be fair to indicate its value as a thriller; three stars have to come  into play to account for this director's failure to encapsulate in whole or  in good-sized part the gist of his source material. Curiously, Kubrick  grafted 'A Clockwork Orange' flawlessly from its novella. It just proves  that he wasn't accustomed to handling a project created by someone as  spiritual as King.Great entertainment, if a little dragging in  areas, 'The Shining' is a must-see on the order of its being a rite of  passage. Watch it repeatedly for academic study or for pleasure - you're  bound to come away better for the experience. It really isn't hard to find  the middle ground between those who overapplaud it as 'haute' arthouse  cinema and those who decry it as a callous cinematic translation or a  massacre of a masterful plan. King hated it and another version has been  filmed since. While more faithful, maybe, to the bits of his book King felt  cheated out of by Kubrick, 'The Shining' Mark Two (1997?) just can't hope  to stand beside this juggernaut.Stanley Kubrick deserves  extra respect for this work in the sense that he endowed 'The Shining' with  his trademark directorial power. The movie is well armoured to withstand  the criticism that it has brought Kubrick. It has become a false albatross  for him to wear about his neck, a job for which he has received much harsh  and undue criticism over the last twenty years, at times borderlining  ridicule.	4.0	Boils down to a good job.	2000-03-31	3	3	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1BLLXKGBTC51Y	Johnny the movie critic	The Shining is definitly one of the scariest movies i've seen.  It stars Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence who applies to take care of the overlook hotel during the winter months.  He starts out pretty normal maybe a bit strange when he's talking to mr. ullman during his interview.  THe movie starts out a bit dull but once the movie starts and the family is buy themsleves in the hotel it's scary. Jack's son Danny has an ability to shine so he knows what's going to happen just like Dick Halloran {Scatman Crothers} head chef at the hotel.  The movie goes through it's eerie scences like when Jack is talking to the ghostly bartender Lloyd and when he's talking to Dilbert Grady in the bathroom and of course when Danny is writing Redrum in his room also when the elevator opens and a pool of blood covers the screen. The overlook hotel itself has great scenery and also how they show the hotel practically every time the day switches on the mountain setting.  Jack is great in this role and people will always remember him in this movie.  I would recomend this to anyone who likes horror and if your a horror fan and you  didn't see this were have you been. this is the second time this DVD has been out at first there's was no remaster and the sound was awful. the second time time they remastered the sound and picture and it's great.  Documentary is funny. Full screen doesn't bother me because that's how Kubrick the director wanted it shown in the 1:33 format.	4.0	Heeere's Johnny!	2002-10-06	2	0	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1EEA6TGBP8EKB	"John Spurling ""psitrancer"""	I think we've all had dreams of being in a place similar to the Overlook Hotel - even before we ever saw The Shining. Endless, mazing corridors; rooms almost vibrating with supernatural potential. This movie captures that atmosphere and dread and makes us feel it all over again in spectacular visuals, stroking the darker aspects of our collective unconscious like a cold, clammy finger. Add into the mix Wendy Carlos's chilling soundtrack - which accentuates the visuals to creepy perfection - and you have the recipe for a genuinely nightmarish experience.The acting, all 'round, is impeccable. Kubrick milked these actors for all they were worth, and it shows, from Jack all the way down to the child actors.For some, especially the younger generation (who are used to the hyperkineticism which seems to define 21st Century entertainment), this movie might seem to drag. But for me, it goes by all too fast. When this film grabs you, time outside the movie loses its meaning, and one finds oneself blinking incredulously at the end; it's like waking up from a dream, surprised one fell asleep.	5.0	What can I say?

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A11XKY4EIU2KNR	"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist"""	Ah The Shining. As usual a brilliant Stephen King book turned into a so-so movie, however this one is better than most. Of course if you've read the book and seen this movie, you'll see many differences and stuff left out, and changed. No bushes shaped like animals chase Danny, Jack has an axe instead of a mallet, Jack actually does kill the cook, and the Overlook does not blow up because of a neglected boiler.On to the movie. Jack Nicholson rules in this flick. His facial expressions, line delivery, and dance with madness will forever be immortalized here. Shelly Duvall is the helpless wife who cannot cope with her husband, and finally Danny, the young son with psychic powers.Of course the `ghost' characters round the film out in a great, fun filled way. The two daughters who Danny meets in the hall will give you the shivers, especially when you see them axed, their father the `former caretaker' has his own charm, the bartender, the bathtub chick, and the homosexuals in animal costumes all help Jack sink deeper and deeper into madness.All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy indeed.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A22BPC7LRSGSYQ	Joker	Actually, that's not the case with me.  But anyhow...So many good reviews of this movie have been written about the plot, etc.  I just want to give my evaluation and opinion of various things.The Shining (1980) is based on the novel by Stephen King.  Director Stanley Kubrick gave us a masterpiece.  I like nearly everything about this movie.  I remember seeing it on cable TV around 1980 and 1981.  This is a different kind of horror movie in that it is not over the top with LOTS of blood and gore and LOTS of killing.  Instead, it's a movie that has a moderate amount of blood and killings (with the exception of the scene with the tidal wave of blood), but it's greatest strength is its reliance on atmosphere and the gradual buildup of tension and horror.  Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) gradually becomes a madman over time.  Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) becomes increasingly terrified.  Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) is effective as the son that possesses psychic abilities.  The story and setting are very simple.  The hotel itself seems to be a character itself.  The atmosphere in the hotel is eerie with a sense of emptiness, but frightening.  There's a feeling that strange and horrifying things are bound to happen in this huge vacant hotel.  Again, the buildup to all-out madness is the movie's strongest point.The camera angles that are used at times are very innovative.The best acting performance in this movie was by Shelley Duvall, in my opinion.  She was totally believable.  Jack Nicholson also gave a great performance.The electronic musical score is great and very memorable.  It's the kind of music that crawls under your skin and adds to a tense atmosphere.My favorite scenes are the bar scene where Jack is having a drink and talking to the bartender, the scene where Wendy discovers what Jack has been typing all along, and the chase around the maze during the snowstorm.This movie is a classic that has stood the test of time.  It's definitely one of the all-time great horror movies.  Stephen King himself actually hated it, but horror movie fans generally like it.This two-DVD set contains commentary by Steadicam inventor and operator Garrett Brown and historian John Baxter, the theatrical trailer, Vivian Kubrick's documentary called The Making Of The Shining, and featurettes called View From The Overlook: Crafting The Shining, The Visions Of Stanley Kubrick, and Wendy Carlos, Composer.I highly recommend The Shining to all horror fans.	5.0	All work and no play makes Joker a dull boy.	2010-09-27	2	1	1

I&#8217;ve seen this film many times on video and really liked it but watching this blu-ray release on a 6 ft screen was amazing. Now I LOVE IT. It kinda made up for being shafted back in 1980 for getting to the drive-in too late. Even knowing what&#8217;s coming up next didn&#8217;t take away from the viewing experience. Kubrick is still unmatched as a filmmaker. Never having read the book but hearing the changes made to the script (via the info contained in the extras) I can&#8217;t imagine now enjoying the book more than the film, but that&#8217;s just me.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A24Q40NN7O07GK	Jon Morris	"'The Shining', written by Stephen King and published in 1977, was adapted into a feature film in 1980 and was directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick. It starred Jack Nicholson in all his insane glory and since then has been a staple of horror and suspense film ""best of"" lists. In fact, only a very small handful of films in history have elicted as much fear as ""The Shining"". It is an exercise in pure terror and a masterclass on filmmaking. What Stanley Kubrick accomplished with ""The Shining"" was a perfect marriage of twisted psychosis, the supernatural, horror, isolation, and ambiance. No other movie makes you feel more claustrophobic and alone than does ""The Shining"". From the beautiful hotel settings to the snow covered hedge maze, the movie has stunning locations and sets and succeeds brilliantly in surrounding the viewer and sucking them into the snowbound and disturbed world of Jack Torrance and the Overlook Hotel.As usual, I will refrain from explaining the plot as it has been done to death on here, and frankly I doubt if there are very many people out there who haven't seen it, or don't know what its about. In the smallest of nutshells, it's a ghost story and a story of survival against the odds and against unseen forces. If I were ranking all-time horror/suspense films, then ""The Shining"" comes in at number four on my list, just behind the seminal films ""Psycho"", ""Jaws"", and ""Halloween"" respectively (with Wes Craven's original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" rounding out the top 5). That is amazing company and ""The Shining"" more than deserves a spot among the best of it's peers."	5.0	An exercise in pure terror...	2013-08-05	0	0	0

And &quot;The Shining&quot; goes a long way to proving why this is still the case.  In a lesser actor's hands, his character would have become a joke - yet Nicholson infuses him with a calibrated presence that makes him stand out in an otherwise so-so film.  Shelly Duval can't compete with the legend, nor can Scatman Crothers - they are both out-&quot;shined&quot; by Jack in an almost forgettable way...in other words, its hard to even care for them because we're so busy trying to figure out what Jack'll do next.  Scary through and through, though  far from being a great adaptation of a Stephen King novel (see &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; for the best of the lot there), &quot;The Shining&quot; still works.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A34D06JL7LC6MU	"Joshua Miller ""Josh"""	Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining is widely regarded as one of the best films of the horror genre and contains some of the most iconic images of not only horror films, but films in general. Like all of Kubrick's films, the initial reception wasn't very positive but time has been good to The Shining. Still today, it's a film that polarizes some viewers; many feel it's too cold, too slow-moving while others regard as it as another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces from the great director. Now, with its availability on Blu-Ray, one is finally allowed to fully appreciate Kubrick's perfectionism. I saw this film for the first time on television at the age of five, tuning in quite late but finding myself glued to the screen. Fourteen years later, and having seen it many times since, I still notice new things about the film. Watching it on Blu-Ray, I can tell you that the iconic images that make up this film have never looked better.Everyone is familiar with the beautiful, scenic opening helicopter shot and the haunting music that accompanies it. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a former schoolteacher, arrives at the Overlook Hotel to take a job as the winter caretaker. The hotel is closed between October and May, with the 25-mile stretch of road leading to it averaging 20-feet of snow. Jack intends to stay there with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd), while taking advantage of the seclusion to work on a novel. Once they arrive to begin their stay, Danny, who has been having horrifying visions of the hotel courtesy of his imaginary friend Tony, meets the chef Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who possesses a telepathic gift similar to Danny's. Soon, the family is all alone at the hotel and as the snow starts covering everything in sight, Danny's visions become more horrifying and Jack begins a slow descent into madness.Few films produce so many iconic images. Audiences that haven't seen this film can identify many of them. Danny riding his bike through the halls of the Overlook, the image of the two dead girls, and the blood pouring from the elevators are some of the most recognizable moments in cinematic history. Then of course there's the legendary scene with Jack Nicholson that is featured on nearly every piece of promotional material for the film. For all of its disturbing and even violent imagery, there's less blood and gore than one would expect from a horror film of this stature. The strength of Kubrick's filmmaking is that many people remember The Shining as a violent film, which it really isn't. Even with a miniscule amount of violence, this film contains some of the most nightmarish images in all of cinema. Kubrick strayed drastically from King's source novel, but the masterpiece that came as a result is much more psychological, ambiguous, and terrifying. Anyone who says differently must remember that nearly every truly iconic scene in the film comes from Kubrick, not King. The flip-side of the argument could be that, arguably, the scariest, most unexplainable, and downright creepy scene, which features a man in a bear (or is it a dog?) suit came from King's novel.Kubrick seemed to always be working with great stories when making his films, but his emphasis was always on form and that's what makes this film stand as tall as it did 31 years ago. The red color motif, the static images of two girls, the blood slowly pouring from the elevator, the score that wonderfully accentuates and strengthens the effect of the filmmaking; these are the things people take away from the film. Kubrick was a photographer before he was a filmmaker and this film really honors his ability to frame a shot of innocent, common things and make them terrifying. The film's majestic, jaw-dropping, unexplained and perhaps unexplainable final shot has baffled viewers for years and given them plenty to analyze/discuss. It's the poetry of these shots that make The Shining possibly the most elegant horror film ever made.The characters are also memorable, but this is because of the actors more than the characters. Not that the characters are underwritten, but the acting is what burns them into your cinematic memory. This is true also for the Overlook Hotel, which is the silent character in the film. As a concept, the hotel is terrifying but the way it appears under Kubrick's direction makes it all the more so. The performance Danny Lloyd managed to give without knowing he was in a horror film is remarkable. It's fine work by a child actor. The late, great Scatman Crothers has such a warm, endearing screen presence that can also be stern and frightening. Duvall must play distressed in almost every scene and the stress that she suffered during the shoot shows in her performance, giving it a real sense of intensity. Philip Stone gives the most oft-overlooked (no pun intended) performance as Delbert Grady. Rarely mentioned in discussions, I invite you to consider how quietly frightening his performance is and how quickly and seamlessly he goes from cheerful normality to terrifying menace.Then there's the legendary Jack as Jack performance. Few actors can conjure up genuine menace in quite the same way Jack Nicholson can, especially when they're going over the top the way Jack Nicholson does. Nicholson has been equally praised and criticized for his performance, with some calling it disturbing and others comical. Jack does go over-the-top, bringing a lot of manic energy to the role and yet, somehow, he's pitch-perfect. He's never unintentionally funny and his teeth-gnashing, vicious performance is unmatched in the realm of performances in horror films. Jack Nicholson may not be what Stephen King had in mind when he wrote Jack Torrance, but Jack Nicholson is Jack Torrance.The Blu-Ray is not perfect. Trivial complaints are that the film begins immediately without going to the menu and the menu itself is just the special features, reminding me of older Warner Bros. DVD's. As the film began, the picture quality was not 100% perfect, slightly fuzzy. Minutes later, the film looked stunning, crisp, and able to draw one's attention to the most minute details of a shot. Nearly every shot has so much more clarity than before. Warner Bros. has a habit of double-dipping with Kubrick films (and by double, I mean I've purchased four different editions of The Shining on two formats) so you may want to wait and see what happens before buying the Blu-Ray, but don't think for a second that you'll be disappointed. I'm sure even Kubrick himself would be at least 80% pleased with the result.To this day, The Shining is criticized for pacing issues but this complaint is all about audience response. I've always found the pacing to be an intoxicating element. The Shining is a rare horror film that gets under your skin and stays with you, growing better with each viewing. It has stood the test of time and will continue to grow in stature for many years to come. Its images still terrifying even with familiarity. It is one of the greatest horror films ever made.GRADE: A-	5.0	Another Masterpiece in a Long Line of Masterpiece's from Stanley Kubrick	2005-01-07	0	0	0

Nicholson's performance, as to be expected, is fantastic.  Danny Lloyd is incredible as well as the son.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A27PEW96DDRIP4	J. Rosenberg	Why is it that Steven King's books have such a hard time being translated from print to film?Robert A. Heinlein said, &#8220;You have to give an editor something to change, or he gets frustrated. After he pees in it himself, he likes the flavor much better, so he buys it.&#8221; It seems to be a truism for Hollywood. The book is never enough, look at Starship Troopers for an example of Heinlein's work.The same is true for the &#34;Shining&#34;.When I read to book in college I was a wreck the next day. I HAD to read the whole thing that night to find out what happened. The following day was a lost cause. And I had to force myself not to leave the lights on in the dorm room!When I saw Stanley Kubrick take on the book,  it was if I was watching a rewrite for a TV movie. It wasn't until I saw it again and forced the novel out of my head, that I was able to enjoy it. Not so much the plot, but Jack Nicholson's over the top performance and the way Kubrick builds the suspense. It wasn't the novel, but it was watchable.If you are a King fan then there are other far more true to book then this movie.	2.0	A Novel Approach to a Novel	2014-05-14	1	0	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AKGXU5LBPF9C8	J. Smolik	Not only does this movie have Jack Nicholson, one of the greatest actors, but it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, the greatest director. Some say the T.V. version that was made a couple years back is better. They don't know  anything. No one can capture the pure insanity of Jack Taurance better than  Nicholson. In the T.V. version, Jack was played by that very mediocre actor  that was on that horrible show, &quot;Wings&quot;. Now I never read the  book, but I've heard that the T.V. version was a lot more like the book.  But, who cares? In movies, I look for quality, not how accurate it is.  Shelly Duvall gets annoying at times, but overall this movie is a classic.  It contains classic Kubrick camerawork, (which I love so much) and  Nicholson's performance is amazing. A must-see.	5.0	The best director and best actor in one great movie.	2000-01-20	1	0	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AWAXS66YMHMNW	"J. Thomason ""Movie Family"""	"The Shining Bowling for Movies Score: 165.375 of 300What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]The Shining - we own this bad boy on Blu Ray as part of a three pack of Stanley Kubrick films (along with 2001 and A Clockwork Orange)Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):An aspiring writer takes the perfect job - a winter groundskeeper at an upscale resort in the high mountains of Colorado.  Jack Torrance thinks he's got the perfect plan - complete silence and solitude in which to work on his novel - time alone to spend with his wife Wendy, and their young son, Danny - light duty job keeping an eye on things at the closed for the winter lodge with all the heat, food, and endless time he can stand.  But as the days drag on cabin fever sets in (not to mention the spooky warning about a previous employee's murderous rampage and the fact the lodge was built on an Indian burial ground) and ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"", Wendy tries her best to hold it together and just keeps swinging, and Danny's psychic awareness provide interesting playmates... this can only end badly - and leaves a serious chill up your spine.Let me start with a disclaimer: we are not really big horror fans so if this is your personal favorite psychological thriller I strongly encourage you to write a review - as it sits here at The Thomason Society for Movie Goodness, a bowling score of 165 places it in the area where I would tell a friend it was certainly a good movie but falls short of great - in Amazon stars it would land itself in the 3 2/3 zone comfortable but it would miss that 4th star for us.  I don't want to spoil anything here and I won't get into specifics but I will say this - the movie was moving along swimmingly, like seriously going to crest about a 200 bowling score but by the end it just faded.  Let me say it another way - imagine you're married and your wife is going to have your first child. You're all packed and ready to go.  You're sleeping in your clothes ""just in case"" - day after day pass and with each passing hour the tension mounts.  You go over the map to the hospital a thousand times and nothing happens.  Finally, its 3:00 in the morning and your wife shakes you... ""Honey, I think it's time,"" she says, ""something's happening!""  You spring out of bed - your SHOES already on your feet and go around to help her out of bed.  As she leans forward she lets out a HUUUUGGGE burp and then says, ""Oh, never mind - must have been the bratwurst, sauerkraut, and spaghetti chaser.""  That's kind of what happened here.  There was incredible tension - the suspense was crazy - and then there was just a bad smell and all the excitement was over.What went right:~ Gosh, a lot went right - the storytelling was wonderful, the acting was great, the musical score was intense, and the tension was palpable.  The story intertwined cabin fever with a truly creepy ghost story.  The fear and confusion displayed in this movie was truly intense...  It came up on you from behind.~ I think Jack Nicholson may actually be insane - he plays it so well - dude does creepy and he does it well.~ The cinematography was simply incredible... The hotel's colors and decorating were absolutely amazing.  Danny's trips down the halls on his Big Wheel really showed the scale of the hotel.  The scene where Danny and Wendy were in the maze and Jack saw them from the model in the hotel was just epic.What went wrong:~ This movie could have easily pulled down a HUGE bowling score - right up to the end, totally anti-climactic; I was totally loving this movie and then got left cold - Mrs. Movie Dude opined the same, what can we say~ Mrs. Movie Dude also felt like they could have traded some of the gore for more character development; she said, ""I did not need a naked dead rotting grandma - what I needed was an ending that matched the grandeur of the rest of the film!""Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews. Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it."	3.0	The Shining Bowling for Movies Score!!!	2013-09-01	1	0	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2GB5CG77LGQRB	Jublistic	The late Stanley Kubrick made some of the best pictures we have ever seen. His 1980 project, The Shining proved to be a big hit with the critics, and also proved that Stanley can do anything: comedy, drama, thriller, war, and in this case, terrifying and classical horror.An exceptional script from Stanley and his impressive co-writer are one of the key elements in this movie. It's engaging, it's intriguing and it has never been done before, making it a truly original film as well as a horrifying one. The actors are quite amazing, Jack Nicholson in particular in the most underrated performance of his career, and kiddo Danny Llyod manages to be believe every time, he follows Kubrick's instructions expertly as expertly as Scatman Crothers, an underrated actor with something about him that makes his characters so immensly watchable. The only actor who was pretty miscast was Shelley DuVall, who jumps on everything Nicholson says and comes off more as a child awaiting her suspension from school than a trapped, terrified soul. Other than that, Kubrick's direction and Nicholson's shouldering of the film make it one of the most engaging horror films of all time.The Shining is a must-see for all Kubrickian's, as well as most horror fans who look for more in films than just gore and jump-frights.The Shining: A	5.0	Stunning, Epic Horror Film.	2001-02-01	1	1	0

It is good though because that way, I would not be disappointed if the movie fell short from the book's story.I have seen the remake though &amp; here is what I have to say.  Kubrick's version is simpler, uses less horror effects (maybe technology constrainsts too or maybe his own option), is less gory but it comes out scarier than its remake version.  The scenes focus on the actors' expressions instead of filling it up with cinematic gory effects thus leaving more room for the viewers' imagination.

This tells me that the reviewer never read the book this movie was supposed to be based on.  Kubrick threw the original story out and wrote his own.  As a story totally separate from the book it might be passable, but if you loved the book then don't bother with this, you will be dissapointed.  Look for the miniseries made later instead, it captured the original story much better.Of great importance to the original story is the fact that the hotel is an entity, a powerful and evil force which takes the character of the father over.  The father isn't mean or evil.  He is, at worst, weak.  Nicholson's portrayal of the father comes across as mean and crazy from the get-go.  Similarly disappointing for fans of the book is the fact that Shelly Duval portrays the mother as stupid and cowardly, which is not how the character was written.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2ZRBYTNCTNFNE	Katie Kump	I get that back in the 80s, this was probably really terrifying. I had seen bits and pieces of it but never the whole thing. After reading the book I was excited to watch it. It was just way too slow. I kept falling asleep! Jack Nicholson does a great job at playing crazy - as usual. But I liked in the book how the changes in Jack Torrence were very gradual whereas in the movie, it seems like Jack instantly goes crazy. Also in the book, the boiler blows up and takes out the entire house. That was the entire point of the book! Danny remembered what Jack forgot. How can you omit this from the movie? And also way to kill off Dick - the one that saves Danny and his mother. I just didn't like it. It didn't do the book any justice at all.	2.0	Does not even compare to the book	2014-02-18	1	0	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1VZLLDNLURGJB	Keith Mirenberg	Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING is one of the films that I have not changed my opinion on over the years. In fact, like most Kubrick films, I find that it gets better with each screening. It was an unqualified five star film experience because of the master direction of Stanley Kubric.I didn't even know when invited to see this film by a friend that it was a Stanley Kubric movie and went to see it on a week night.  Needless to say I told my wife about it the moment I got home and asked her to see it that weekend.  Even though this film was not terribly true to the King novel we both felt that it was another wonderful Stanley Kubrick movie.I also enjoyed the performances of both Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. Jack Nickolson said during an interview that he really wished that he could have been in another Stanley Kubrick film.  Shelly Duval stated during her interview that Kubrick was merciless, but did help to bring out her very best performance.I saw this film when originally released in Connecticut in 1980.  A few days later I overheard two ladies speaking about Jack Nickolson's performance in the mall and tuned in to hear what I thought would be great praise for both the actor and director of THE SHINING.  I was very surprised to hear that they thought Jack Nickolson should be ashamed of himself and that Kubrick had some nerve to release another such film in the United States (I assumed they were talking about CLOCKWORK). I guess they thought that Kubrick brought out the very worst in Jack.	5.0	THE SHINING - A Really Great Film!	2008-03-09	2	0	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A16YB92FTBQJKT	Kelly	How's this for a minority viewpoint? A lot of people don't like her performance because they don't like her character whom they see as absurdly passive. Excuse me, but I've known lots of very sweet, very passive women ( like Wendy in the film) who would (and have) put up with exactly the kind of bullying and abuse she puts up with from the creep wonderfully played by Jack Nicholson -- a real louse even before the spooks get hold of him...Ms Duvall played this type of person, desperate to please and be loved and taken care of, flawlessly. This film is a masterpiece. Unlike junk horror films, the fear builds slowly, gradually drawing you in. The camera work (using a technique that Kubrick pioneered, I understand) gives the feeling of being there with her in that haunted hotel. Easily one of the best horror films ever made.	5.0	Three cheers for Shelley Duvall!	2001-07-29	2	2	0

I was skeptical but approached it with an open-mind, even though I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the Friday the 13th remake. Boo! This movie sucked! The things in it were so random, like the bear suit guy and the blood spilling down the stairs. They didn't even have to do with the plot. The acting was horrible, too. I was hoping Wendy would've been axed already so she'd finally shut up and get back in the kitchen! This movie is so un-scary that I thought I'd never be scared again. Then I saw gems like ""Orgy of the Dead"", ""Dead End Road"", ""The Dentist"" and ""Turistas"" and realized that good horror films do exist, just skip this Shining crap!"	1.0	Least scary movie EVER made	2009-07-11	38	2	36
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1CTWR56NV2XZ8	Ken Cubelli	Why this movie opened to negative reviews when it first came out is something I will never quite understand.  Sure - this film has almost nothing to do with the King novel.  Yes - at times it doesn't make sense.  And yes - it is a tad bit too long.  But all these complaints can be justified.First of all - everyone knows that there was simply no way to bring the novel to the screen as King wanted it.  Kubrick knew what he was doing.  To bring the story to the screen as King wanted it would have required six hours perhaps, which was how long the T.V. miniseries was (know anyone who craves to buy that film on DVD?)  For the Shining to work as one film it had to be done the way Kubrick did it.  Thus Nicholson's performance is justified and at times brilliant.  His quick descent into madness is appropriate for (1) film.  A gradual descent would have taken much more then 142 minutes.Plot - honestly - anyone who complains about the confusion of the plot are the kind of people that complain about taking a plane ride to Hawaii in second class.  WHO CARES?  Style over substance perhaps, but when your heart is pounding during the bathroom scene or the Heeeeeeeere's Johnny moment, do you honestly care if the plot doesnt make a whole lot of sense.  Yes the ghosts aren't given a motive for their making Nicholson kill his wife, nor does the final image make a whole lot of sense, but there is complaining, and then there is nitpicking.Length - I agree it runs too long, but as I sit here, I honestly cannot think of a single scene that should have been cut.  The doctor scene perhaps, but even that scene is effective, as Wendy's account of Jack's drunkenness give an ominous feel to his mannerisms.But enough about the cons.  There are so many pros that make this film nothing short of a classic.  The set design of the Overlook, the profoundly creepy and atmospheric score, Kubrick's solid direction, and then the performances, which make the film soar.  Scatman Croethers is naive, wily, and charming as the ill-fated cook who dares to mingle with Jack's &quot;duty&quot;.  Duvall's aw-shucks mannerisms wear a bit thin, yes, but they prove a perfect counterpoint to the deranged lunacy of Jack.  Besides, when Jack flips out in the lounge scene, she fake cries as good as any actress as I have ever scene. Danny Lloyd has a hypnotic screen presence as a boy hiding some horrible secret - check out the glare in his eye as Wendy talks to him as he becomes Tony.And then there is Jack.  What a complete actor this man is!  His performance is campy, over-the-top, out-of-control, and brilliant.  Let the King loyalists praise Steven Weber for turning Jack Torrance into an inconsequential ninny.  When Jack peers through crack in the door and utters his famous line, the horror is palpable.	5.0	An Underated Masterpiece	2003-12-24	5	3	2

There aren't to many extras on this blu-ray, but it's the best looking and sounding version of The Shining that I've seen. For less than $10, you can't beat it.On a side note...my favorite thing about this purchase: I have been a fan of the movie for many many years, but had never read the book. After reading the book I got obsessed with wanting to see the movie on blu-ray. The last version I purchased was in standard format on DVD. After killing a Saturday afternoon trying to locate one around Tulsa, I gave up and ordered a copy on Amazon. I was happy because of the price, but felt defeated because I had had my heart set on watching it that night. But within minutes I got an email from Amazon letting me know that I could watch the HD version online instantly for no additional cost! Needless to say, I was stoked.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1W661TC1P6VQI	"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi..."	"Though me and my mom normally share various points of views on certain film makers, we tend to split when it comes to Stanley Kubrick. My mom says, ""he's so weird."" I tell her ""yeah, but he's a brilliant film maker, who films visually stunning films that are also mesmerizing."" To this she just shrugs and says, ""I don't care, he's still weird."" Though a big fan of the director, for some reason his 80's horror film, ""The Shining,"" escaped me for the longest time. Based off the best selling book by Stephen King, ""The Shining"" is one of the Kubricks masterpieces. Yeah, yeah, I know for many people every movie the man made was a masterpiece, but this is one of those rare occurrences where art and entertainment collide so spectacularly, it almost feels accidental.The movie revolves around Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson, in one of his best roles), a struggling writer who is having a bad case of writers block. He is a recovering alcoholic who lost his teaching job due to his short temper, so he interviews for a job as a caretaker of a hotel that closes it's doors during the winter season. Jack gets the job, and moves his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) to the hotel for the winter. Before letting them into the building though, the manager warns them that due to the months of insolation, they are likely to experience Cabin Fever. One caretaker apparently suffered this and ended up killing his wife and two daughters. Jack thanks the man for the warning, but takes the job anyway. It's a shame Jack didn't know he was part of a Stephen King story, he most likely would have passed on the job.What follows is nothing short of a full decent into madness. Though this is a horror film, and the movie is indeed very scary, Kubrick is a good enough storyteller that he knows how to properly build the suspense. At first little happens in the house. Wendy and Danny explore all the various rooms in the house, while Jack tried to write a novel. When that fails, Jack simply wastes time by bouncing a tennis ball against the wall. Once the snow starts though, things get bumpy. Jack becomes more and more agitated, Wendy becomes more scared of her husband. Most telling though is Danny, who earlier in the film talked to a friend who lived in his finger named Tommy, and how it appears Tommy wants out, making Danny say ""Redrum""over, and over again.Either Danny is also going crazy, or there's more to Redrum then initially meets the eye. Though all these developments may sound corny on paper, the truth is they are built up very slowly. For the first two hours we follow a pleasant family around in this big house. Then, as Jack becomes more delusional and Danny more crazy, things start to unfold. If this movie was made today, Jack would become crazy and start killing off a group of stupid teenagers for two hours. Instead, Jack starts talking to ghosts. Then he starts shouting at his wife. Then we feel he is a threat to his family. When the violence finally hits at the end of the film it hits hard. It even features an image of Jack Nicholson that has become iconic.What makes the violence the payoff is that we work our way towards it. The movie is not senseless violent, and its more about fear then killing. A twist at the end will make you question and rethink the whole experience of the movie, much in the same way the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"" forced a re-evaluation of that film. This is not a bad thing, but a good thing. This means that the film is about something. It's here to make you think. That you are entertained is a blessing, but the images, the words, and the silence are all working towards provoking certain feelings from you, and the story is deeper and more complicated then you might think at first. ""The Shining"" offers well thought out thrills, a complicated story, and a memorable ending. It truly is a classic.Rating: **** stars"	4.0	Shine Your...Light?	2008-02-12	7	3	4
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AO461REE0KA4J	keviny01	Among the titles in the new Kubrick DVD Collection (released on June 12, 2001), THE SHINING has the most improved video quality compared to the one from the old Kubrick collection from 1999.  The old SHINING DVD version looked grainy, dirty, and dull.  But the new transfer is clean, sharp, and colors look more vibrant and realistic.  The old mono track has been replaced by a Dolby 5.1 surround track, and the haunting music sounds much better as a result.  The included &quot;making-of&quot; documentary also has an improved picture, plus a new audio commentary track by its director Vivian Kubrick (the little girl in 2001).  Much of the 30-minute featurette was shot on the set of THE SHINING, thus it provides a rare, fascinating look at the director at work.  Some memorable moments include Danny Lloyd speculating on how much money he will earn, Scatman Crothers in tears (of joy), Shelley Duvall exchanging some arguments with the director.  Leon Vitali, who supervised the making of the new Kubrick DVD Collection, is also seen as one of Kubrick's assistants.  (The multi-talented Vitali also played the adult Lord Bullingdon in Kubrick's BARRY LYNDON.)  On the commentary track, Vivian Kubrick provides further information about the making of the film and some trivias such as who typed those zillion pages of &quot;All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.&quot;  One wishes that she had provided a full-length commentary for the movie itself.The fact that the DVD presents the film in full-screen and, as a result, unmasks a lot of empty, &quot;dead&quot; spaces near the top and bottom of the screen that were not seen in theaters, bothers some people, even though it is what Kubrick had intended.  It does not bother me, however.  In a film in which vast, open spaces have a great deal to do with the theme of the story, it seems fitting to add spaciousness to the composition.  Kubrick did make an error in allowing the shadow of a helicopter to be visible in an aerial shot; it would not be visible if the film were letterboxed in its theatrical 1.85:1 ratio.  By the way, THE SHINING and EYES WIDE SHUT are the only titles in the new Kubrick DVD Collection that are labeled as &quot;presented in the aspect ratio as Stanley Kubrick intended.&quot;  (Does that mean that the other DVDs in the collection are NOT presented as Kubrick intended??  Hmmm...)The packaging of the new THE SHINING DVD looks very similar to the old one, except the new DVD case has &quot;Digitally Restored and Remastered&quot; printed near the top.  The artwork on the new disc is the same as before, but the running time is misprinted as 142 minutes; the film still runs 144 minutes.	4.0	The remastered Shining DVD is a keeper	2001-07-07	3	2	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A356TJCTCLDN89	Kimberley Wilson	First, as any Stephen King fan knows, this is Stanley Kubricks vision of the Shinning, not Kings. Kubrick makes several changes that will either please you or annoy you. Wendy is a weaker woman in the movie, Dick gets killed instead of coming to the rescue and Danny talks to himself instead of hearing Tony in his mind.  Also, in the movie Jack is crazy from the start and the hotel just makes it worse.So, has Kubrick butchered the book? No. Kubrick's Shinning stands on it's own as one of the scariest, most unnerving horror movies ever made. If you can watch the woman in the bathtub scene and not squim in your seat, check your pulse because you might be dead. The DVD is nothing special, so buy it for the sake of the movie and not because of any background information.	5.0	almost perfect	2002-08-17	3	2	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2BDJOIXPR2AYU	King of Controversy	"Filmed about 11 years prior to the TV show the X-Files, one wonders if this film, about a man possibly driven to murder by supernatural forces, is a precursor to that show, or if it is the first made for TV Lifetime movie. The X-files would feature murderers who turned out to be supernatural beings or animalistic entities, with dapper 'Fox Mulder' solving the case. If you were a viewer with a guilty conscience, or perhaps even with some private evil thoughts of your own, tuning in to the X-Files provided the relief of seeing these murders turning out to be caused by supernatural forces. With Jack being somewhat driven to kill, one wonders if this is what the film is set out to do, or if instead this film is meant to create that guilty conscience in the first place? With it's themes of spousal and parental abuse, this film perhaps provides more of a warning than anything else. I've been where Jack is in the film, once telling a girlfriend, 'leave me alone (I have important work to do)'. On the other hand, before going off the deep end to murder, we see Jack's children taken from him by their mother when Jack really hasn't done anything yet, ""If you suspect him, it's a sign he's cheating"", ""if he says he sorry, it's a sure sign he will do it again"".The only thing keeping this from being a made for TV lifetime movie is that the wife and child and the woman's preferred sexual partner (who doesn't appear in this film) don't all kill Jack or beat him up or have him arrested at the end. They simply escape from him and Jack freezes to death outside. On those grounds this film should be recommended. A violent showdown is not the only possible solution. This film is not a gore fest either. There is a scene (an imagined one) where a hallway outside an elevator fills with blood. This scene is shown about 3 times in the film. I'm not one to be afraid from simply seeing the sight of blood but I may be now. This scene isn't presented in a shocking way; the hallway gradually fills with blood. Jack does embrace a beautiful stranger who turns out to be an ugly corpse, and it is frightening when the twin ghosts tell Danny, 'we want you to play with us, forever'.The most effective scenes for me are one's where Danny is riding around the hotel in a Big wheel tricycle (I must have had one as a kid) and another scene where Danny plays with toy cars on the carpet. I Definitely played with toys in a similar fashion as a child. In some of the scenes, Wendy's eyes just look huge, and beautiful. In a lot of the other scenes her teeth look huge (and beautiful). Some of these close-ups may have been filmed with some kind of 'wide angle' lens.The hotel feels decaying and decrepit, or at least as if it has seen better days (as the man who hires Jack tells him at the beginning of the film). Like the toys, I felt I was there inside the hotel. How many rooms inside the hotel are going to be painted in an ugly shade of orange? The sound effects and music to The Shining at times border on being overbearing. This is definitely an attempt at creating a movie watching experience or sensation. It's OK that the music is loud and startling but I feel the film would be better if the sound were gradually raised to the high volume it reaches. There is a huge amount of echo and effects added to the dialog at times. For the most part I think this worked very well. I actually wouldn't mind watching this film again, with a nice sound system, and in an undistracted environment, to hopefully immerse myself in the film and feel whatever sensations are intended.There were at least two parts in the film I didn't like. When Wendy locks Jack in a food storage room, we never see how Jack gets out (we have to assume the ghosts let him out, so I definitely wanted to see that). And when Jack is about to bust into the bathroom to get Wendy, after she cuts him, Jack leaves to chase Danny. Being Jack is carrying, and well-using a fireman's axe, it's hard to believe Wendy scared him off. A public web page claims that at this point Jack hears a snow tractor outside and this is what distracts him.When the movie was over, a friend of mine mentioned (and I was watching the film at his house) that when Jack goes down to the abandon bar and takes a seat, exclaiming, ""I'd sell my soul for a drink right now"" this is when things start to really go bad.When wondering whether this is the first made for TV Lifetime movie, whether this is more akin to the X-files, or even a guilt inducing story, or just one trying to scare us for our lives (hopefully leaving us feeling thrilled to be alive), one can't help thinking about Kubrick's earlier film 'A Clockwork Orange'. That film, in my opinion, was meant to be a metaphor for British men who were falling out of favor, getting well-deserved punishment for their bad behavior - one could say. It could have been titled 'Falling Down'. Critic Roger Ebert would begin his review of that film by calling it, ""A paranoid right wing fantasy masquerading as an Orwellian warning"". He ended his review of A Clockwork Orange by saying the films message seems to be, ""in a world where society is criminal, the citizen might as well be criminal, too"". At least there is some hope in that film - at least perhaps if you are British. Near the end, a member of the ruling class tells the protagonist of A Clockwork Orange, ""We'll send him somewhere where he can never hurt you again"".I have no idea what to make of The Shining. It's not that bad. It scores massive points for being different and for being filmed in an artistic manner."	4.0	The first made for TV Lifetime movie	2014-05-14	1	0	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A5COUH0OBUVZD	kmanthie	THE SHINING.  Originally, a novel, by &#34;horror&#34; writer, Stephen King, THE SHINING may be the only example of a movie being better than a book it's based on, if it's not an original screenplay.  I've seen many versions of books I've read or would read later and in all these cases, the book is invariably better: it's easy: there's more space, more things that one gets from reading the book that don't get addressed in the film or might be, but may be expressed with symbolism or allusions.  But, THE SHINING was made by Stanley Kubrick, who had recently made spine-tingling brilliant films from novels (A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, by Anthony Burgess and 2001:  A SPACE ODYSSEY, by Arthur C. Clarke), was to be HIS movie; so much so that he even added in a couple extra things that weren't in the original book; the full-sized Labyrinth, made out of shrubbery, isn't in the book, but is used in the film as almost a character in itself, with all it's twists and turns.  This is so well-made; there are so many things going on at certain times, but everything was carefully by Kubrick.  It is one of those films that one, just as with his other films, can watch over and over again, they're all so dazzling and also because, sometimes, the more you watch, the more you pick up - a certain prop or phrase that you didn't pay attention to before suddenly takes on significance to you, regarding something in the movie,  There are even people who really obsess over this film-if you ever see the documentary ROOM 237, you'll see what I'm talking about - people think the film's underlying message is the horror of the Nazis and the Holocaust; others brought up imagery that, instead, pointed to an underlying message of the extermination of Native Americans.  What made me really brush it aside was when one guy (we don't see his face, unfortunately-no one who speaks in here is shown, it's weird that way, huh?) started to on and on about how Kubrick was working for NASA and/or the Air Force, etc, and his &#34;mission&#34; was to use his filmmaking skills to &#34;shoot&#34; the moon landing and all subsequent films that we've all seen and all think it was &#34;really filmed on the moon&#34; when, in fact, this guy goes on to say, &#34;I'm not saying they didn't actually go to the moon, yeah, they went there, but they couldn't run the camera once on the moon...&#34; then went on to talk about how Stanley Kubrick had been a big part of the making of these rigged films of &#34;the moon&#34;, meant to show the world, pictures of what the moon looks like, etc (I don't know how that iconic &#34;earth rising&#34; photo could've been faked, since you'd have to have seen it, been there  and seen it and you couldn't reproduce something like that, not back then, at least) and so this crazy guy is going on about all the little clues Kubrick's placed throughout the movie that make  supposed references to this &#34;moon landing staging&#34; that he'd done, some bordering on the absurd.  That was it, after this guy's rambling, insane references to staged moon-surface films that were filmed on a set in Hollywood, by Stanley Kubrick, I completely lost interest in this ROOM 237, &#34;mockumentary&#34; and barely paid any attention to the rest of it.  But, however, it did give me a renewed interest in THE SHINING, itself, the film.  I can't wait to get it and see it againl  It's been a long time since I've seen this movie soon I'll have the DVD.	5.0	THIS MAY BE THE ONLY FILM THAT IS BETTER THAN THE BOOK FROM WHICH IT DERIVES	2013-12-23	1	1	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A27DECSQ1YQX48	K. M. Morris	This is the best copy of this film you can get next to blu-ray and hd.  They have really overworked and cleaned this film up to pefection, clear and ver sharp picture at best.  The sound is perfect to.  The old kubrick collection release was sub-par at best.  The additional features and commmentaries are really neat and break down alot of kubricks ideas and goals and visions as a filmmaker.  What else can I say about this film thats already been said before.  You either love it or hate it.  This is one the best pyschcological horror films ever created, of a man and his family slipping quickly in to madness.  Don't try and compare the book and the film.  They are two completely differents stories almost.  The book is basically and haunted house story, were as the kubrick film is purely a psychological horror story, beautifully crafted.  Jack Nicholson gives a milestone performance as well as the whole cast.  I've seen this film probaly more than a dozen or so times and each time it scares me and I find something new i have never noticed in the film before.  The book and the film are about dead even as far scares go, but both stories give you something new.  PLEASE avoid the miniseries remake if possible-its like watching some cartoon.  If you liked the shining, I highly recommend director Brad Anderson's films Session 9, and The Machinist, both excellent psychological journeys.	5.0	Classic film gets upgrade	2007-11-01	5	3	2

I actually now have all 3 versions. Amazon got me my copy quick and in good condition.The Shining is in my top 10 movies I like of all time. So that means I can rewatch it to an uncountable figure. I would not consider it a Horror movie by todays standards. I have my own genre I put it in. The ""Psycho"" genre. That means any movie that has a really good character playing a really good psycho killer. Jack is one of the best at this type of acting.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1DJQEQ1MOL4Q	KO Smith	This is one of the greates horror-movies of all time. The only thing which is keeping me from rating it 5 stars, is that STEPHEN KING's version from '97 is so much better. (I haven't seen this movie in America. In Norway  it's for sale, with a rating for &quot;18 years&quot;.) As said, this a  Stephen King story, and Stanley Kubrick is doing a good job directing this  movie. The scariest scene was of course when the kid &quot;Doc&quot; met  the to twin-girls in the hall. I'm not going to say more. Jack Nicholsen  and Shelley Duvall is great, but as said, it can't beat the '97 recording.	4.0	A Classic!	2000-05-20	5	1	4

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1Y7TEMVW94B2G	kryptfinkle	You heard me, it's better than the book, and the crappy tv series too.Stanley Kubrick got rid of the unnecessary crap from the book, and stuck to the meat of the story.  As well as the blatent subtle hint at the  begining.  'now remember if you don't turn this down the whole hotel will  explode.'  Gee I wonder how it's going to end?Stanley Kubrick dispenses  the obvious, and sticks to the unknown, you've read the book sure, but  what's the point on seeing something if you know what's going to happen  next?The film is a stepping stone, if you want to know more, read the  book.  But the ending is so much better than the book, because it's so  realistic, and tense, and the characters don't seem to be standing around,  wondering what to do next like in the book.The dialogues between Jack  Nicholson and Shelly Duvall, are really tense, and scary.  That you really  feel for the characters.GOd knows why Stephen King wanted to re-make the  Shining, it so laughably bad, and so un-scary, i've coughed up far more  scarier stuff than that, and the tv series is just talk, and talk, and  talk, and talk.  I want to be scared to death, not bored to  death.Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is best Stephen King horror  adaptation so far.  There have been good adaptations like Carrie, The Dead  Zone, and Misery.  But the sheer intensity of The Shining is so great, that  it makes every other adaptation of his like your average run of the mill  horror stories.So stop living in denial, and embrace the real Shining,  that was made by Stanley Kubrick.	5.0	THE ONLY FILM THAT IS BETTER THAN THE BOOK!	2000-04-15	0	0	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A356RFKNIG043B	K. Swanson	SK is one of my favorite directors, and Jack one of my favorite actors, and The Shining is the best King book of them all, I think, so this film is just pure classic all around. I saw it the week it came out (it was a lot of fun in the theater, scared people silly at points), and unlike many films of that era it holds up perfectly today. I always wanted to see its many superbly composed shots in high def at home, and now I do, thanks to a near-perfect transfer to blu-ray.The colors are crisp, with Kubrick's unique printing techniques making the snow look as good as snow ever has in a film...even though it was all salt and styrofoam. The sound is very clear and clean, and the only complaint I have is one that I'm seeing more and more of on BD reissues: they didn't letterbox it. I have an old lb dvd, and this full screen version does indeed crop some off the top and sides, which to my mind isz unforgivable for a director like Kubrick, who composed every square inch of his images like the master he was. As one of the bonus features here points out, he was a photographer before director, and that sense of composition is why his films look so damn good in every frame. So to cut even a bit off those frames is a crime, and it's done here.Why are studios doing this? Just to sell us a letterbox blu-ray soon? Probably, as no other reason makes sense. Sad, but that's studio greed as always. However, they get a mild pass for not having any trailers on this, just the film, and five very nice extras that were on the last dvd version. There's a doc on the film, one of SK himself, ande best of all is his daughter Vivian's home movie of the making of the film, including a few priceless bits of SK telling Jack how to play a scene, and some other sweet bits of Jack horsing around backstage. Plus there are commentaries, one by Viv on ehr film, and one on The Shining by the cinematographer and SK's biographer. Both are worth your time.Not much to add about the movie, other than to say it's one of the finest low-key suspense/thriller/mild horror flicks of them all. It's a real treat to see it in almost-theater quality, even with the edges trimmed.And for serious Kubrick fans who hated seeing the skeleton scene at the end trimmed off other editions, it is in this one, so rejoice in completeness. With a director as sublime as Kubrick, everything should be precisely as he wanted it. (So why not letterbox his films just enough to see 100% of his intended image, not 94%...)	5.0	Kubrick and Nicholson equals glory, and a near-perfect blu-ray	2013-03-09	0	0	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1OF6ZMTDZ5R5W	"K. Townsend ""Writing, Books, Life"""	As a long-time fan of books as movies, I prefer them to have some input from the author. Kubrick just &#34;loosely-based&#34; his film on King's extraordinary novel. I kept feeling like Kubrick's version was too predictable. Despite camera tricks (perception, spatiality, patterns), a few special effects, etc, there was not the pull of terror I had reading the book.The actors were okay. Jack Nicholson has natural facial expression that make him appear evil, while Shelly Duvall is mousy and plays her role in a very vanilla way. Only in the climax scene in the bathroom, does she show emotion worthy of someone in her situation. While this version has that avant guarde feeling Kubrick enjoyed. I would rather stick to the re-make done in the nineties as a miniseries. My reasoning - it takes place in Colorado, uses the Stanley Hotel (where King wrote the story and based the Overlook on), and King himself worked on it. The miniseries is better juxtaposed next to the book than Kubrick's, but that's just my opinion.	2.0	Too Much Artistic License	2013-01-31	3	1	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AXZ2JI5FHML3L	Kyle Turner	As a stand alone movie, this one is pretty good. But I'm comparing this too the novel and because of that, I was a little let down. I've seen this movie before but have just recently read the novel and so I had to re-watch it. Again, maybe I'm not being fair in comparing them but it's hard not to.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1XE0O9OVY4RED	Lady Pennington	One of my favorite movies.  Even with Jack Nicholson saying &#34;Here's Johnny&#34;,  this movie was really thrilling.  The little boy with the Shining Gift [or curse]  was a scene stealer.  As one who knows about Shining,  it can be very frightening,  especially for a child.  This movies was not just about terrifying scenes,  like with the two twin girls,  slaughtered by their own Daddy Dearest,  but the mental downhill roll of Nicholson's character was done just right.  To think,  even it is just a movie,  to be alone in a quite deserted Hotel with a history murder,  sexual disfunctions,  and to have a mad man running around with a hatchet,  after a poor defenseless woman and a little boy who can see the horror on it's way has got to be terrifying.  The haunting music,  from many years gone by, certainly helped too.  This was a Classic that has to be seen on a raining or snowing day.  And if you find a typed pile of papers, with the same sentence over and over, beware of the crazed man running after you in the snow maze.  I hope you all enjoy this..	5.0	Scary and Funny,  great combination!	2013-03-25	0	0	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	ALCKYWSV2ZTTC	Latricia Finley	I know this is classic and all, but I hated it and I could barely sit through it til the end. I could forgive all the deviations from the book if the rest of it weren't so tedious. The loud, shrieking music. I get it. It's like music in every other movie. It's there to help drive the story and it helps to put you in what ever mood you're supposed to be in while watching the scene. But for me, that got to be too much. I hate that the cook was killed off when he was. He was of more use than that. Shelly Duvall? Hated her as Wendy. She was just plain annoying. All that screaming. The Wendy in the book wasn't that terrible. Her main goal was protecting Danny. I did like Jack as Jack.. He was good. I wish we could have seen a little bit more of that transformation from loving father to full on psychopath. That came too quick for me. It was a process. He had some ok moments before he was taken over. I also loved the hotel and the decor. It looked like a place I wouldn't mind staying. I'm 36 and I know that if I hadn't seen the entire movie when I was younger, I had at least seen parts of it. I don't remember which. I was excited to see it again because I finally read the book and I loved it. It's my first Stephen King novel and I can't wait to read more by him. But this movie sucked. I plan on reading Misery next. I definitely remember seeing that movie and it's one of my favorites. I can't wait to finish reading it and then watch it again to see what changed and what didn't.	1.0	No. No. No.	2014-05-20	5	1	4

That being said, even though he disliked this movie adaptation of his book, I loved it!Kubrick created  a masterpiece of horror and suspense in this movie. Other King movies focus  more on the conventional blood and gore stuff, this one tries to climb  inside your head and mess with it, which I love. From the first stirrings  of madness in Nicholson, to the wonderful moment when a freaked-out Duval  realizes the &quot;novel&quot; her husband has been slaving over is merely  drivel, to the famous &quot;redrum&quot; little Danny shrieks, it's all  there, and it's marvelous.If you haven't seen this movie yet, and are a  King fan, you should love it (despite what a previous reviewer says). If  you're not a King fan, you'll still love it if you're willing to let the  movie work on your head, rather than do the obvious blood and guts stuff.  &quot;Scream&quot; it's not, thank goodness!

Its different and better than the movie in many ways. The book has more characters and a more in depth plot. There is so much that goes on in Jack's head in the book, and before i saw the movie i wondered how they could communicate all of it in a movie. They did a great job. Jack Nicholson does some amazing acting and i was not disappointed. There are some things different than the book, but i found it didn't ruin a thing for me.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1AN4BW4L547V2	"Lee Devenport ""Bullitz"""	I have never come across such a gripping and well made film in my life. Sure there are a number of fantastic films out there, but when you think of them being 'well made' you realize that some are not as good as they seem. Such as Scarface it deserves 5 stars, but in terms of acting talent (other than Pacino) it is poor and the  use of the camera cannot compete with the Shining, I don't think any film can compete in terms of the crispness of directing, I love the irregularity of the camera angles which typified Kubrick as a masterclass in directing, Scarface is still a fantastic film but in terms of making it good to look at - it sort of fails, but then there came The Shining, adapted from a fantastic Stephen King novel the film is a wierd tale, Jack Nicholson superbly plays Jack Torrance the winter caretaker of a hotel high in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, he is up there with his wife and his son. His son (played very well by a young Danny Lloyd) has an unusual talent, the shining.As the story unfolds, Jack begins to lose his mind as he is haunted by the horror of murders past and it ends in a crescendo of which he tries to kill his family. Can the Shining be used to save their lives, well it is and as Jack finds out and is influenced by theinvisible evils in the place he goes completely bonkers and is intent on a murderous rampage that will leave his family sorry. It has a grim ending and it is very tense because you don't think that the wife and son will getaway due to them being snowbound and isolated from the world.I don't think any other film anywhere has ever had so many memorable quotes nor do I think there is any other style of directing that could beat this, it is in a class of its own. Stanley Kubrick relly brings the chills and creates more suspense than you can handle, the eerie climate made is just another thing that adds to the terror and with Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Philip Stone and Scatman Crothers it is clear the film will stun and it does, it is one o the best films ever made due to the fact it has been concentrated on and developed sublimely before being given to the masses. Kubrick's legacy will always be remembered through this film. I hope he rests in peace, we will alwayys miss him.	5.0	"""HEEERRRES... JOHNNYYY!!!!"""	2004-11-17	3	2	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AYMZTWBG0V53W	"Leslie Karen Rigsbey ""Leslie Rigsbey"""	The opening scenes of the mountains and lakes look as clear as a picture on a widescreen TV; there is no mistaking this visual opulence. The BluRay disc has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and this widescreen format fills out the edges of the screen so that one can see what kind of visual scheme that Kubrick was up to. The sound of the BluRay disc is also wonderful, with the music track working wonders and the sound effects genuinely eerie. The extras on this disc are also good, with the great Vivian Kubrick mini-documentary included, along with a pretty good audio commentary featuring Garrett Brown--this exciting inventor of the Steadicam speaks of how the film was intended to use this cinematographic camera technique in a new way, and his thoughts are pretty interesting for film historians to listen to. His contributions to Kubrick's visuals are significant here.As for the film, this is where the King began to slide down the mountain (I speak of Kubrick, not Stephen). Kubrick, unfortunately, believed that one could cure cinema (essentially clean it up of its &#34;badness&#34; and lazy qualities) by using scientific-like means  and peculiar methodologies to figure out what it is that works and what it is that doesn't while shooting a picture, and thus he stripped most of his later films of their enjoyable qualities. God knows that Kubrick was no Hitchcock--he would never have said that he wished he didn't have to go out and shoot the movie; a critic may suspect that Kubrick never had a finished map in his mind at all when he went out and turned every new project into &#34;Adventures in Attempted Filmmaking.&#34; I do like Jack Nicholson, and I am not surprised that these two guys did well together here. Is &#34;The Shining&#34; a horror film? To me, it's never been that scary at all, and I think that the murder-and-madness moments are too mundane to be truly menacing (rather than being muscular, they are more morose, moody but not maddening). In any circumstance, it probably is best that Stephen King stayed away from the project (despite his legions of fans shouting their protests of his cinematic inactivity over the years, sheesh), because when a filmmaker approaches a subject, he needs to see it as a movie and not as a literary abstract (I insist that fans of the book are missing the point about what Kubrick is doing here--he is NOT a good horror film director, and he misses the fun element of making a scary horror story (such as the animal topiary stuff)--but he is trying to create a visual experience as opposed to a truly cerebral one, so he obviously wouldn't care about the &#34;warmth vs. cold&#34; aspect behind King's critical assessment of this &#34;adaptation.&#34; The fact that he didn't call King in for help in adapting the script (and instead gave the book's draft to then-current Gothic professor Diane Johnson to expand and rethink) is proof that Kubrick saw King's work as being too pulpy and too slop-shop--he really wasn't interested in King's ideas. But, that being said, &#34;The Shining&#34; is an interesting visual experience, but it's not much else. B-	4.0	As nice of a transfer as one can demand from a BluRay disc...	2014-03-13	0	0	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	I had never seen this 1980 film before because I generally avoid films dealing with the supernatural.  But now, more than 30 years later, I wanted to check out what this famous Stanley Kubrick film was all about.  Well, it sure is a horror film.  It held my interest throughout and kept me at the edge of my seat, waiting for the next surprise that this famous director had in store for the audience.The acting was exceptional.  Jack Nicolson and Shelly Duval star as a married couple with a six year old son who agree to be caretakers in an isolated luxury hotel during the winter months.  The child has an imaginary playmate and hears voices and sometimes he speaks nonsense in a grown-up adult voice.  Jack Nicolson seems like a well adjusted teacher who craves the isolation in order to write a book.  But he soon turns into a homicidal maniac.  His performance is nothing less than absolutely great and is certainly one that skyrocketed him to a fabulous career.  Shelly Duval is lesser known but I am surprised her name is not a household word.  She has unique looks with gigantic eyes that express the horrific conditions she is thrust into and I just couldn't take my eyes off her.Then there is the plot, of course, which was adapted from a Stephen King novel.  It is weird, twisting and held my interest throughout.  And yet it made no sense.  Frankly, to me, the movie was just a vehicle to watch Shelly Duval scream and Jack Nicolson gradually go insane.  Yes, the film was well crafted by one of the greats in the industry and the film has become a classic in every sense of the word.  However, my logical self yearned for a plot that made sense and a satisfactory conclusion.  But I guess that is just too much to ask for with this kind of film.	4.0	Great performances and fine directing.  It just didn't make sense.	2011-01-28	2	1	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AYZLXLVMJGTJV	L. J Nary	This movie starts out slow and progressively gets scarier and scarier. Thats what I liked, some people may want more speed, but I find that it makes it more scary slowly building up to the ultimately freaky frightful ending. I say freaky because Kubrick makes this film weird and strange. There is one shot of two people in the hotel room, obviously ghosts, and one is dressed up like a mouse or some other strange kind of animal. It just has a strange twist to the normal scare tactics. The movie has alot of beauty to it. The blood scene coming out of the doors and flooding the room is of course horror, but it also has an artsy touch to it. I recently watched it with some kids and they were very bored at first, not enough action for them, but if I kept them focused on it, telling them things about it, kept refocusing them on it, they got really scared. They wanted me to turn it off after the old lady in the bathtub. I just love the acting. The little boys withdrawn nature and how he talked for Tony. Shelly Duvall and her naive, passive nature. Also some of the looks she gives when all the scary stuff is happening are priceless. Jack is great as head of the family turns demonic, but always with a comic edge. The movie takes that bizarre turn and mixes some real scary stuff and pairs it with strange scenes or as I said there was a sort of comedy attached to the way Jack was acting, even though it was awful, which I think made it even more the scarier. Like a man just really going through a mental breakdown. Overall, one of my favorite scary movies! A definate go see, if you don't have to be scared right away, and can allow the movie just to flow.Lisa Nary	5.0	Very Scary Arthouse Fare	2002-02-23	3	2	1

When watching this, you need to remember Stanley Kubrick is the director and he tends to have a lot of ""white space"" or time for artful like scenery.  Much of the first part of the movie has scenes of long winding roads, driving miles and miles up a mountain to a beautiful hotel.  There are also scenes of a young boy riding a three-wheel trike through long halls and empty rooms of the hotel.  A garden maze is also featured with tall green bushes cut in at least an acre of ground that the young boy and his mother navigate as the main character seems to watch above a model inside the hotel.At the beginning, after a three hour drive for a job interview, most of it up the sinuous mountain road,  an aspiring novelist, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) has an interview for an off-season job at a enormous Chalet-Type Hotel isolated in the Colorado mountains.  Jack, his wife (Shelly Duvall) and his young son (Danny Lloyd) move in for the five winter months, with the agreement to maintain the elegant hotel.  They will be isolated as the road to the mountain top is not cleared during the heavy winter storms.  Jack is told of the scary history of the hotel, which included murders by another custodian that they feared got ""cabin fever"" from being alone so long.  Jack laughs off the possibility he will get cabin fever, he just wants to be alone to write, and this job fits his needs perfectly.Sinister powers begin to seep through the hotel and then flood it with chilling horror.  With remarkable visual panache and a keen sense of irony, Stanley Kubrick rehabilitates Stephen King's trashy, terrifying novel."	4.0	Edgy and Scary -	2010-08-03	1	0	1

However, it's not quite up there with the likes of ""The Exorcist"" or ""Evil Dead."" The story, based on Stephen King's novel (though King hates the movie), is about the Torrance family moving to the Overlook Hotel to tend to it during the winter. The father Jack slowly begins to lose his mind and is soon chasing after his wife and son, which eventually goes outside into one of the scariest, most haunting chase scenes ever. The movie gets a little boring at times, with shots going a little longer than needed, but the story is very thick and we care for the characters. Jack Nicholson steals the show, however, in a role that will almost have you rooting for him, the villain!

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A79U01AE98EV8	MACLEAR	Please keep in mind that I am a devoted fan of Kubrick.  He made what, to me, is the finest film about war (&#34;Paths Of Glory&#34;), the finest science-fiction film (&#34;2001&#34;), one of the most intriguing films about the way society solves problems of immorality (&#34;Clockwork Orange&#34;) and one of the slyest films about obsession (&#34;Lolita&#34;) ever made.&#34;The Shining&#34; perhaps transcends genre.  It certainly is not a horror film.  Neither is it a successful suspense film - it rambles, it lacks energy, its flaccid.  Allow me to point to one execrable scene in which Shelley Long (hopelessly miscast and, for the most part, acting as though she just woke up from a long winter's nap) engages in a conversation with a state trooper on the ham radio.  The conversation is mundane with many pauses (is this because someone feels the conversation is so heavily deep that the audience requires a few minutes to digest the arcane matter?).  It lasts what seems an eternity and advances the plot not a whit.  Nor dies it give us any new perspective on Long's character.  Which leads to another problem.  Wendy is not given a personality, well, not a human personality.  She's Mrs. Cleaver and Danny is her little Beaver.  The character has dishwater for brains.  She is docile, meek, and unbelievable.  One gets the impression that once she and Danny lick their wounds she'll calmly say, &#34;Boy.  That was an experience, huh?&#34;The film's tempo is slow - but real slow.  One person speaks, there is a pregnant pause or two or three, and then the other person speaks.  Every word is weighted as though it were sacred.  It's as though they've swallowed too much Sominex.  Many have faulted Nicholson's performance.  I am not certain why.  His is the only life in the film and even he spends all too much time looking off into space.  And yes perhaps he does overact at times - but that is something this film cries out for - someone to grab us by the throat and throttle us.  Blood crashes through an elevator door but whose blood is it supposed to be (and are we supposed to care or simply marvel at the image?).  Truth to tell, with all the gobbledegook about danger and madness and all the images of blood and decadence, little blood is spilt.  I mean, the guy can't even get the better of his simp of a wife - even his child outwits him (not a massive undertaking by any means).Many have enjoyed this film and see in it things I guess I do not.  I take nothing away from them.  But if you are in the mood for thrills rent &#34;No Country for Old Men&#34; or &#34;North By Northwest&#34;.	3.0	A few good scenes in an otherwise disappointing effort by a master director	2014-05-07	2	0	2

Pity Haley Joel Osment wasn't around to take his place.Once you get beyond that, though, the beginning is also an understated stunning opener!

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AK9UPC78LIPIR	maelje	"Much has been made of author Stephen King's dissatisfaction with Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of his third novel, ""The Shining."" In fact, far TOO much has been made of it. True, the book and movie are significantly different, but one wonders what King was expecting. Kubrick was one of the most independent, individualistic of filmmakers; whatever he did, he put his stamp on it. If King thought Kubrick was going to treat ""The Shining"" any more reverently than any of the director's previous source material, he was sadly mistaken.King's main objection to the film is his belief that Jack Nicholson played Jack Torrance, the lead character in both book and movie, as crazy from the beginning, whereas in the novel, the presumably haunted Overlook Hotel causes Torrance to go gradually insane (in both cases, Jack's alcoholism also seems to be a factor). First of all, King is exaggerating. Yes, the movie does suggest Jack is mentally disturbed before he ever arrives at the Overlook. But the film is yet dynamic concerning this element; whatever is ""wrong"" with Jack, the Overlook amplifies it drastically. Second, I believe King's opinion was colored by the role Nicholson had played in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" insisting that the audience would identify Jack Torrance with Randall Patrick McMurphy. The truth is, though, that Nicholson made four other films in the five years separating ""Shining"" and ""Cuckoo's Nest.""Apparently, this all bothered King so much that he couldn't resist the opportunity to remake ""The Shining""; it appeared in 1997 as a three-part TV miniseries based on King's own screenplay. I can describe that effort in one word: Forgettable.And Kubrick's ""The Shining"" is anything but forgettable. In fact, I think it stands as one of the great horror movies of the 1970s and early 1980s, a very fertile time for the genre.There are images in this film that will haunt me forever. Who can forget Danny, the Torrances' son, riding his Big Wheel down those long, carpeted halls? Or the way the Steadicam followed him? Also memorable: A long, long closeup of nothing more than Nicholson's face, lingering on him as his Jack Torrance begins to come completely unglued. And of course there's the scene in which Jack, trying to get to his wife, Wendy, bashes his way through the bathroom door with an ax. And the two little ghost girls who torment Danny. And the young/old woman in the bathtub. And ...And on and on, really; ""The Shining"" has so many iconic moments that it's almost inevitable that those who discuss the film will leave out something important. (I've deliberately left out one of the most infamous visuals in the film; feel free to comment on my review if you can fill in the blank.)I think ""The Shining"" is a great film. Perhaps King is just too close to this particular novel to see it objectively; it is one of his most personal books, given that he struggled with his own substance abuse, as does Jack Torrance. Whether ""The Shining"" ""scares"" you or not depends on personal taste; those who love ultraviolent slasher flicks probably aren't going to be impressed. As for me, even though I have viewed the film many times, it always gives me a fright and a thrill."	5.0	It shines on	2012-09-25	10	9	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3B6JWWBJKDPSS	"Magickal Merlin ""Wizard"""	When I first saw the 'Shining',many moons ago,it captured my imagination.I've seen the film at least a dozen times.Years later,I was reading books on the 'Illuminatie' and 'Secret Societies'.Also about Native Americans and the various tribes.I watched the film ,the 'Shining', again recently.This time on an intellectual level,of hidden meanings of overt images shown.It's sheer genius,around the table.Kubrick masterfully illumes the images from the darkness of hidden meanings.Stephen King pens a modern horror classic.And Jack Nicholson plays the part as if tailor-made for him.Kubrick,King and Nicholson all collaborated their element and it clicked.Fine acting,astute directing,and crafted writing all melded into an excellent creation here.Shelley Duvall and Scatman Crouthers were perfect auxillary players.Shelley,she represents the enslave Native American,in body and spirit.Scatman,he represents the Indian chief ,who turns over control of the land,to Jack Torrance,who represents the white European settler.The Indian is pagan,and the Pilgrim is christian.Wendy Torrance(Shelley)cooks and serves her husband,her master,eggs with bacon strips.The bacon represents the killed and deceased Indians of the native land,where the grand hotel now sets.Jack hardily eats the bacon and later hunts for more.The famous scene of Jack at the door pounding out,'Come out little pigs,or I'll huff and I'll puff',is a scene classic.Wendy realises that she will wind up like the rest of the slaughtered native peoples,killed during the Indian conflicts.When the Torrance family arrive Jack and Stuart Ullman,the hotel's chief manager,discuss the work and hotel history.Dick Hallerin(Scatman)oversees the hotel's supply inventory and physical operations.Dick takes both Wendy and Danny into the grand food pantry. Hallerin turns to little Danny Torrance and says,'How about some ice-cream,Doc?'.As Hallerin turns,right behind him,is a container of Calumet brand baking power.The logo has an Indian ,with a full head-dress.Kubrick shows that the spirit of the canned Indian is 'overlooking' Dick Hallerin,the negro caretaker,who has aquired the ability to commune with the trapped native spirit.The name of the hotel is the 'Overlook'.The double meaning here is the white European christians overlooked the virgin landscape,and fail to 'inner-look' at themselves and their society for western man's drunken irrationality and greedy ignorance.Native American motifs and Illuminatie Sun imagery are all around the screen,scene after scene. In a later scene,Jack awakens in the locked food-pantry.As Jack pounds on the door,there are some food products around him.Again we see the Calumet can,with the trade-mark Indian looking upward at a jar of Tang Orange powder.Tang was taken abroad the Apollo moon travels.The tangy orange logo represents the shining Sun and Apollo was the Greek god of the Sun.And leading towards Jack ,are boxes of 'Golden Rey' peaches.Perhaps Kubrick uses this imagery to show Jack Torrance is unaware of the shining rays of illumination,behind him and around him.Jack Torrance is a 'white man',yet lives in the 'dark',trapped by his illusions and those of his western thought.Jack is 'released' by the call to do his civil duty,by the former christian caretaker,Delbert Grady.Grady had murdered his wife and twin daughters,perhaps when they 'wandered' away from path of christian thought and morals.Grady's christian thinking has given him providence over the lives of his family.(Mass murderer John List claimed his family had been corrupted by the zeitgeist of day,and his religious convictions therefore allowed him the execute his entire family.)Grady's twin daughters were free to play and roam,like wild Indians.Grady's wife may have become amourous towards other guests or native spirits.The scene where Jack enters her room ,she's bathing and arises.She's nude,and now free of cloth vestiages that bound her to moral living.Jack approaches and the two embrace.Yet,the reality remerges.The old virago stands loudly cackling.Jack's delusions evaporate with the steamy bath mist.Jack Torrance wanted that mirage of unfettered romance and was left only with the horror of the ghastley murder.The last scene,Wendy and Danny trying to escape.Danny heads to the hedge-maze.Jack pursues him through-out,following his little footsteps.Danny backtracks and hides out in a snow-banked corner.Native Americans used this trick of 'false-feet' ,to throw off their enemies and lead them away from the true location.Danny then flees and out of the labrynthe maze.Jack,like the Minotaur man-beast,roams around in pain,looking for his next victim.Wendy helps Danny into the Snow-Cat truck and drives out.Come sun-rise,Jack Torrance is frozen solid,by the hedge-maze.I think Wendy leaves not with hatred towards christian society,but with a better understanding of the depths it can sink into and darkness it can bring out in people.And that the grand hotel is a modern christian structure.That may have trapped the troubled free-spirited Indian souls;both time,space and location.	5.0	Why the 'Shining' still shines+	2010-05-25	5	0	5
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3QZXDBATXFNZX	Magnolia	The Shining is by far the greatest horror film of all time. People need to under stand that this movie is differnt from the book. Stanley Kubrick put his own thing's in the movie that were not in the book. He just adapted it which doesn't mean it has to be exsact but it has to have the same basic story as the book. This is a movie not a book weather its adapted from a book our not. Anyway the DVD is good but the picture isn't all that great. But its still a good DVD take a look for your self.	5.0	The Best Horror Movie Ever Made	2001-11-05	1	1	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1R283L4SH4UP8	Magpie	"The newly restored and remastered DVD of The Shining is INCREDIBLE!!!!! As a longtime fan of this film and all of Kubrick's work, I bought the original Kubrick DVD set last year and accepted the transfers for what they were. Then it was announced that the NEW Kubrick set was coming out. I rolled my eyes and said to myself that I was finished. That I had had it with all of these ""remastered special editions"" that the studio releases well after the original release just to soak up more profits, blah blah blah, etc, etc. Anyway, that I would NOT buy these new editions because really, how good could they be? Well, recently my local video store bought the new set and had all of the films available for rental. So I thought I'd take a look at The Shining. YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS CLEANUP JOB!!!! Part of what gave The Shining it's charm was it's washed-out look (in my opinion)....MAN, I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THIS MOVIE HAD THE POTENTIAL TO LOOK LIKE!!!!! Seriously, this movie looks like it was shot YESTERDAY (with the exception of Danny's haircut and some seriously 70s carpet designs) the colors are amazing and rich AND THE SOUND IS SO CRISP AND CLEAR!!! I can seriously hear the strings being plucked during the opening theme (Dies Irae, by the way). This is what remastering is all about!!! PRESERVING!!! Not screwing up like with the remastering job on the Jaws DVD (such a hack job, they re-did practically all the sound effects, making the shark sound like it was belching at Brody during the climactic fight.....shiver), Warner Brothers made The Shining brand-new all over again. Plus there's now a running commentary by Vivian Kubrick (Stanley's daughter) during her documentary ""Making of The Shining"" which is very insightful and funny due to her dry wit and English accent (funny in itself since her accent is thick and when we see clips of Kubrick directing he has such a heavy Bronx accent)Needless to say I ended up buying this DVD, I gave in. How could I not? I don't know if I'll cave in to buying the other ones but if you're a fan of this movie, I'm telling you, BUY THIS DVD.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A254QJ5BTEUH85	Magus	The Shining is Stanley Kurbrik's movie adaption of Stephen King's novel. The story is about Jack Torrance and his family taking care of the OverLook Hotel for the winter. Strange hauntings and a break down of Jack's mind are the horror of this movie.Jack and his wife Wendy look forward to go to such a large hotel and have it for themselves. Jack besides spending some time in seclucion wants to also write a book. Their only son Danny is nervous about going to the hotel, and doesn't seem all that excited. The reason for this is Danny has ESP, that has to do with seeing some past events in the form of images. The hotel has a very powerful effect on him, by allowing him to see ghosts. Danny somehow has a spirit also within him, that advises him and shows him images.The family is shown the whole hotel by Dick Hallorann, a cook in the hotel while it's open. Dick has ESP of his own, but he doesn't seem to have a spirit within him. But he does see past events, for what he tells Danny in the kitchen of the hotel. There's a few odd haunting scenes, but no all gore or attacking like most horror ghost stories. Some of the ghosts seem to be a threat, others are manipulative.Jack experinces his own problems, I didn't get this after viewing, but on Disc 2 they explain Jack has his own ESP. He doesn't try to understand it for what it's worth, or even tells anyone of what he sees of ghosts. I felt the isolation also got to Jack, unlike Wendy and Danny. Jack starts showing signs of disrespect for almost nothing when Wendy tries to talk to him. Even when she knows bad things are happening to Danny in the hotel, it just frustrates Jack even more.Towards the end there is complete chaos from hauntings and from Jack. I liked the ending a lot. It's simple, but the last shot gives it all.The camera angles and the hotel itself give a lot of the mood of the movie. It's a nice hotel, but you feel it's somehow not safe, especially with only 3 people there. The hotel is huge. My favorite is the Golden Ball room with it's high ceiling. It's shown a few times throughout the movie.This is the newest version of the Shining. It features 2 discs, the WideScreen movie format for disc 1. I've read that you will be missing the top and bottom with this version. But you will get more of the sides.Some people claim it was orginally fullscreen, some say widescreen.Disc 2 features the making of the Shining, all by Stanley's daughter's. She uses the camera to show how the movie was made. Capturing the working of the actors, and showing Stanley's directing to them. Jack Nichlson and Shelly Duvall are mainly shown to tell how they felt about the expierence during and after the completion of the film. They show the sets and locations of the hotel. How they did some of their camera tricks to capture so many different angels and motion.	5.0	The OverLook Hotel	2007-11-20	4	2	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1IANEBSMVGHS9	"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny"""	If you thought &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was scary, forget about it. Although good, it's nowhere as this suspense thriller brilliantly directed by the late Stanley Kubrick, and even more brilliantly starred by Jack Nicholson.A concierge, and his wife and kid are bound to spend the wort part of the winter at a mountain resort all by themselves. There is a 'legend' that such a task in the past drove a previous concierge crazy. Nicholson  then embarks with his family on a ride they will never forget. There is little I want to say to you, other than: please believe me and get this movie.In line with other Kubrick movies, an even more brilliant underlying meaning, beyond the 'apparent' plot, goes in line with all the details, camera moves, and parts of the script. Unless you're weak of the heart (in which case, it might not be the best idea to see it), you will deeply enjoy the genius of Kubrick at its best.One final piece of advice: see it until the final titles are over...

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL	Marcel Lee	"A mother and son who find themselves trapped at an empty hotel with an axe-wielding killer are the ones I'm supposed to rooting for, but all the while I'm hoping he chops them to bits. Then I'll no longer have to look at their asinine facial expressions. They're terrified, yes; if an axe to the face isn't scary enough, the hotel is also haunted by ghosts; but director Stanley Kubrick doesn't seem to realize that it's possible to be terrified with a straight face. Exaggerated grimaces, especially in the case of the mother; the pathetic victim type a villain in this type of movie thrives on; takes away from any potential realism The Shining has to offer.But that's a side issue. The main problem here is the story itself, which, thanks mostly to an unnecessary reliance on paranormal activity; ""shining"" apparently means a form of telepathy; is often nonsensical, or, at best, confusingly random. Is Jack Torrance going crazy or is he really seeing ghosts? That seems like a valid question until his wife starts seeing them too. Then the answer should be that he's not going crazy. But he obviously is. So the answer must be both, which is all too convenient for the plot; a plot that is now allowed to lazily throw logic out of a hotel room window in favor of creepiness for the sake of being creepy.marcellee.com"	2.0	2 of 5	2013-05-28	5	3	2

I just want to mention that the Blu-ray version of this film is the best I've seen it in years! The HD picture quality is amazing -- more clarity, depth, and richness of color. The Blu-ray also retains the original theatrical aspect ratio. (Even though the film was shot at 1.33:1 it was matted at 1.85:1 for movie theaters.) In the full screen version presented on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD, helicopter blades can be seen at the top of the screen during the opening credits. Obviously that was accidental.Most of the extras are from the older DVD version, but there are a few new extras on the Blu-ray too, like the commentary from the cinematographer. Overall, if you're a fan of this film, the Blu-ray version is highly recommended.	5.0	Blu-ray of THE SHINING the Best Version of This Film	2009-07-12	6	5	1

I first saw this movie with two of my friends on TBS(I now own the restored version DVD) when I was 6 years old. It was the scariest movie I had ever seen. Jack Nicholson scared me to death in the ""Here's Johnny!"" scene. If I were you, I would skip the scene when Jack goes into Room 237.It starts with a writer named Jack Torrance(Nicholson) who gets a job to caretake for an isolated hotel in the Colorado Rockies. He brings his wife Wendy(Duvall) and his psychic son Danny(Lloyd). Jack hears from the manager Stuart Ullman(Barry Nelson) about the previous cartaker who killed his wife and two daughters with an axe. At the hotel, the Overlook Hotel's cook Dick Hallorann(Scatman Crothers), who is also psychic, talks to Danny about the ""shining"". Hallorann also warns Danny about the hotel and Room 237. ONE MONTH LATER, Danny sees strange things. Blood pouring out of an elevator. Two little girls stalking him. The word ""REDRUM"" on a door. At that time Jack is finding weird things of his own. He gets drinks from a ghost bartender. He runs into Delbert Grady(Philip Stone), the previous cartaker!! Grady tells Jack that Danny is using his ""shining"" against him and Jack turns against his family. Danny tries to shine to Hallorann to get help sense Jack hasn't been acting himself lately. Can Hallorann make it in time?""The Shining"" is easily one of the best Horror movies ever made. has a great supporting cast: Scatman Crothers, Barry Nelson, and Philip Stone. I think that Scatman Crothers won a Best Supporting Actor Award. Look on us.imdb.com to find more information. Unlike Friday the 13th, which was also made in 1980, this movie had a very low body count. I thought that this was one of three of the most sucessful Horror films of all time(the others were Psycho and Halloween).I do sort of understand why Stephen King didn't like this version. There were many differences between the movie and the book. In the book, they didn't skip one month later. The killer used a Rougue Mallet instead of an axe. I recommend the restored version of The Shining instead of the original DVD. This movie tops other scary movies like A Nightmare on Elm Street(pretty good), Friday the 13th, and Scream(another good slasher) Overall, this movie gets an A+!"	5.0	Stanley Kubrick's The Shining	2002-09-21	1	1	0

However, ""The Shining"" is filled with horror and it actually scared me, which is rare.  It is about a writer, Jack (Jack Nicholson), who decides to live in a hotel during the winter, with just his son and wife, and no one else in the hotel.  Jack's son can read minds and sense ghosts, which comes in handy because the hotel is filled with ghosts and supernatural beings.As time goes by, Jack starts to grow crazier and crazier, developing writer's block, while Jack's family is starting to fear him.  During their stay at this haunted hotel, the family is constantly scared by ghosts of people that were murdered in the hotel.  Also, later on, Jack tries to murder is family with an ax!

It's not jump-out-and-grab-you scary though, so don't expect it to make you scream and jump.  Kubrick takes his time and removes all the &quot;boos and gotchas&quot; to really concentrate on the  &quot;mental deterioration&quot; of Jack.  This is what makes the movie so  affecting.  It isn't merely a &quot;horror flick&quot; so much as a  meditation on evil and isolation.  Because the film seems to happen  so---quietly, i suppose, is the word, it all seems more believable, despite  the supernatural elements.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2TCOC3BSRNB1H	Matt	This movie once again shows Stanley Kubrick's skill for completely re-thinking a film genre, and still making a great movie.  The Shining is a very eerie film with plenty of psycological twists that will leave you asking questions for days.  Kubrick took many specific steps in the production of this movie to make it different from other horrors.  For example, the entire movie is filmed in full light, instead of nearly complete darkness (which seems to be the trend lately).  Yet, this does not subtract from the value of the film, in fact I think it adds to it's uniqueness.  If you keep an open mind throughout this movie, then you will absolutely LOVE it.	5.0	Outstanding in every aspect	2001-05-19	1	1	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2C7WAXG5OHTZ7	Matthew Rocca	Stanley Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; is totally inferior to the book and the miniseries, but Jack Nicholson does a fabulous job portraying the rantings of a madman. Without Jack Nicholson and the character of Delbert Grady, the film would be a disaster. A mindless, bloody, violent film, failing to live up to the expectations of true horror movie lovers. The only famous actor in films I can think of who would play this part just as brilliant or more brilliant than Jack Nicholson is Robert De Niro, who excellently portrayed the role of pyschopath Max Cady in &quot;Cape Fear&quot;. Anyways, this movie is all-in-all great, if you don't compare it to the book or miniseries. I recommend it for fans of horror.	4.0	ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK  A DULL BOY, HEEERE'S JOHNNY	2002-09-10	4	1	3

King's own criticism seems fair but irrelevant since Kubrck's version manages to be scary-- a tough bullet to bite for most King screen adaptations. I'm a fan of this one, and I'm a fan of  the novel. Ain't much of a fan of King's miniseries version although I like parts of it (yes I'm aware that it's very faithful to his novel, no that doesn't necessarily make it more entertaining). Also, now that King's sequel novel, &#34;Dr. Sleep&#34; is out, one can't help but wonder what sort of film or films will come of that.	5.0	Scary or upsetting or something.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3JJJ4H5HX99YH	Matt W	Kubrick wants to be a genius. In some regards he may be, but in many regards it is his film making techniques that excel, but not his sense of story telling. There is a rule in literary fiction: if it does not progress the plot, throw it away. Kubrick excels in such excess. So many scenes in this movie have nothing to do with the plot.It is understandable that Kubrick's tale is not the same as King's tale, and King himself is not the best writer in a literary sense, but he can write horror well.If the plot of this movie is to illustrate Jack's insanity, then whole sections of the tale are unnecessary. We don't need background information on Mr. Darby (the Overlook's last killer/caretaker), the whole 1920's theme of the Gold Room is horribly unnecessary, and Danny's &quot;Shine&quot; (the basis of King's tale) is totally excessive.If the point were to illustrate Jack's insanity, the story would focus on his inability to write. Kubrick ultimately wanted a different story then the one he started with. To add insult to injury, some scenes serve no purpose at all, but to confuse the audience. When Shelley DuVall runs into the room with the man in a bear costume doing &quot;something&quot; to a ghostly patron, well, what on earth does that have to do with anything? That scene makes me laugh every time I see it. Are we supposed to think that this hotel was some kind of Sodom and Gomorrah?(And a bizarre one at that)The whole film hints at a long horrible history to the hotel, but Kubrick never evolves that. This is an interesting film and true to Kubrick's style, different. At the end of the day, it is not a good story. Kubrick tends to revel in visual stimulation versus plot stimulation (think 2001, A Clockwork Orange, etc). And sadly, more to the point, this movie is just not that scary.See it once, to be sure, but even the 1997 made for TV remake does a much better job of telling a story.	1.0	A Movie With No Story To Tell	2003-04-19	41	21	20

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2XW6Y6NS70JSV	"M. B. DaVega ""pop culture historian"""	The Shining (1980) is in every way an epic horror classic that really just gets under your skin. It's not only one of the best horror films ever, but also one of the best noteworthy flicks of 1980. I won't get into the plot too much as I'm sure by now it is no mystery to anyone. But I will share my feelings on it and what the impact of watching it is like. The Shining could almost be called a cinematic perfect storm with so many factors combining together that worked out so advantageously.The first is Stephen King's novella, which this adaptation is one of the few to actually do justice to, the second is director Stanley Kubrick's masterful vision and the third, of course, is Jack Nicholson's frighteningly intense, tour-de-force performance that will scare the S#*% out of you! Ordinarily in most of his movies, it's fun to watch the always larger-than-life Jack chew scenery, but here in The Shining it's much more likely to scare than amuse you. I can only imagine how unnerving it must have been the crew on set during filming with Jack when he was in character and if they were ever worried if he would know when to break it between takes! Also, the son's repeated, high-pitched screaming of redrum (murder spelled backwards, as we all know) is pretty disturbing and scary as well.Thanks largely in part due to a very creepy musical score and a remote, snowbound Colorado location at the resort, an overall sensation of forlorn dread and isolation permeates this film, which only further amplifies the terror factor. All of this combined with nightmarish, haunted hotel imagery, ghoulish apparitions and setting make for a pretty damn scary cinematic experience. Almost 30 years later, this horror epic still packs a potent punch. Definitely one that stays with you and one you don't want to ideally watch by yourself!Even as an adult, to this day and beyond, this movie still gives me the creeps.	5.0	"""Come here, Wendy.

The location, the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park Co. about an hour out of Denver opened in 1909, built by F.E. and F.O. Stanley (Stanley Steamer), opulent, luxurious, breathtaking in conjunction with the surrounding country there just are not enough superlatives in English to accurately describe it. The movie really doesn't do the location justice but it gives you a glimpse of the grandeur, the hotel itself comes with plenty of supernatural tales in it's own right and management takes full advantage of this in a very artistic manner.I had the good fortune to play piano at the Stanley during the season of '70 so it is a highly significant re visitation for me.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AY0RZL53GANW2	Media is going down the drain faster than pis...	"Stanley Kubrick has created some of the most visionary, superb titles in the movie kingdom in terms of creativity and observation.  These titles are unfortunately, highly limited to Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut.  This is to the extent that Kubrick has also released some not so great work, in my opinion, such as Space Odyssey: 2001 (which was completely a directing style/over quantity; no quality plot, script, entertainment, etc.) and Dr. Strangelove (I was told this was something of a ""comedy"", but this was no laughing matter when you're turning off the movie after 20 minutes of unfunny dialouge.)  I believe the Shining arrives somewhere in between the quality known to be the trademark of Kubrick's films; this is neither a great nor a shoddy Kubrick film, merely an inadequate one.The Shining simply does not have a plot; at least not a plot that relies upon consistency.  I enjoyed the movie every bit - but it was more like I was watching a drama than an actual horror movie.  Here's some reasons why The Shining cannot work as a horror film:A.)  First of all, it's never a good sign when you, the observer, side with the killer in a horror movie.  Make's the movie a lot less scary, and surely more disappointing to know your hero is going to die.  Sure, I might be a bit sadistic; but there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted Jack to axe down his obnoxious, compliant, brain-dead wife, and his poor acting, silly finger dumb f### talking son.Really now.  The son is most unconvincing as an actor, but we have to blame the story, and the fingering, for that one.  And the crying, screaming woman.  God kill her.  She's supposed to be the victim here, but the victim hasn't a clue.  Jack screams and screams at her and she just stands there and takes through the entire movie.  I would want to kill her too.  Does she not have a mind of her own?  Am I the one to believe she is the only person who is not out of their right mind in this movie?  I have no sympathy, and apparently Jack doesn't either.We are lead to a ""scary"" exuberant scene where the wife has a knife, and Mr. Johnny sticks his head up to the door.  ""Aren't you going to kill him?"" we the audience ask.  We try to reason with the movie screen.  ""Uh miss - um...he's going to kill you; do it now!""  Apparently not.  Instead she just sits there and screams like a little baby.  ""Don't kill me, oh please don't kill me.""  Oh look - now he's sticking his hand in and trying to reach for the doorknob.  NOW you stab him!  Wtf?!B.) This movie is frighteningly unscary.The job of a scary movie is to force the audience to identify with a key character, and then to put this character in situations that are constantly ""scary"" to any sort of reasonable person in effect.  As I said before, I couldn't identify with the victim, but that doesn't mean that a movie can't be scary.  But this one is definitely not frightening.Take for example; the scene where the kid is sitting on the bike starring at what he knows is not there: a pair of Siamese twins. Oooooohhh.  Do you know what COULD have been scary?  Instead of the kid closing his eyes to find the Siamese twins have disappeared (which is what the audience wants), he could open his eyes to find that not only are the Siamese twins still there but they are standing right in front of him.  Now THAT would be scary (a position the audience does not want to be put in).  But nothing like that here.Here's another prime example: The scene where Jack enters the bathroom to find a beautiful naked woman prime for his sexual pleasures.  We, the audience, know this is just an illusion, but we don't know how the scare will be revealed.  All we see is the flesh in the mirror being torn away - unoriginal (the audience gets off unharmed).  What WOULD have been scary?  Face the camera in front of the woman as though the audience is looking through Jack's eyes, and then have the woman look up with blood filled black eyes, and have her snap at the camera like a wild beast (putting the audience in a disturbing position).  Now THAT would be scary.The only thing that is scary about this movie is the music, but the film gets carried away with playing disturbing music at every moment, even at inappropriate times.  You'll be watching two characters on the screen just talking, but the ""scary"" music is constantly playing to suggest we are looking through the eyes of the wife, and we are feeling as though at any second Jack could crack into a million pieces.  Hell, I was feeling like Jack.  Looking at her like a crybaby.  ""You gonna let him talk to you like that?"" I was yelling.  ""Stop wining, and do something!""C.)  Lastly, the plot makes no sense.First of all, we have this stupid kid and his so-called ""shining.""  He can see what happens before it happens.  So why is he the one who is putting up the ""redrum"" sign?  Makes no sense that he would take part in his own foresight.  He can see the future, but he can't stop himself, what?  And what's with the blood flying all over the place?  Not scary - it's not connected to the story.  Kind of looks like red rum to me.Second, the painting at the end is a stupid attempt to make us all think really really hard.  I tend to stop the movie before this point, and conclude that it was the director that needed to think really really hard about why this scene made absolutely no sense, and why he needed to leave it out.Overall, an interesting movie to debate about.  So I say you check it out.  But the next time you get lost in a hedge maze, I suggest you just climb up that s###."	3.0	Adultured Ambition	2005-04-22	19	0	19

I've only read a couple of his books, and find them notoriously difficult to get into. Especially Carrie, get to the point! My dad has all his books, the only one I think I actually enjoyed was The Green Mile. I don't remember ever reading The Shining book, I have seen the movie before though with my dad.The first positive thing I will say, is that some of the opening scenes, and the scenery around the Outlook Hotel, is crisp and so gorgeous in High Definition. The opening shots, when the camera is tracking the car driving up the mountains, is absolutely amazing. It's just perfect.The score to this movie is really atrocious though. It's not even nice noise, it's jerky and meaningless. It doesn't add to the movie. I could have done a better score. It just doesn't work, or enhance the movie in any way.Jack playing funnily enough Jack, is amazing. He's the only reason for watching this movie. His portrayal of Jack slowly descending into madness (""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"") makes you keep watching the movie, since he's in pretty much nearly every scene. Up against Shelley Duvall (who I wasn't keen on personally), he steals the show, even when she's doing her wide eyed screaming scenes. He does his utmost to scare the viewers, and he certainly scared me. There is a couple of times I have to look away from the screen - especially one of his last scenes in the movie when he's frozen. I actually have to turn physically away when that happens, I can't watch him, that image is burned into my mind now.There's something about the late Stanley Kubrick's work, that I really don't like. I've seen this now twice, and I've also seen Eyes Wide Shut, and neither seems to have anything that resembles a plot. And he was such a perfectionist as well, getting actors to ridiculous amounts of takes (127 takes for Shelley for one scene). Nah.

Terrible casting and bad direction has turned this subtle psychological suspense/horror book into a straightforward horror movie. Jack Nicholson, who is otherwise a genuinely talented actor cannot be held totally responsible, in my opinion, for the horrible overacting here. His character just transforms into a monster instantly, no progression, no suspense, one minute a sane, loving father, the next a raving maniac. Shelley Duvall is a disaster as his wife Wendy, her neverending hysterics a constant irritation throughout the film. I was almost hoping for her to get the axe just so that I'd be free from the agony of having to watch her cry. Stanley Kubrick's patented overuse of steadicam and wide angle lens keeps us so much away from the story and the horror that we're never engrossed totally. Also too elaborate lighting on the sets is distracting instead of being realistic, reinforcing that effect of isolating us from the action. Editing is slow paced with needlessly long shots, causing the scenes to look conceived and forced. I was really disappointed with Stanley Kubrick's clinical style here, which in my opinion is more suited to a technical film like 2001.	2.0	a clinical and not too subtle adaptation	2002-10-29	14	9	5

Not only do we get more resolution from the frame-filling widescreen image, but the more-than-double-the-resolution of 1080p HD renders this film in as close to a 35mm presentation as it's ever been.

I've watched The Shining many times and never tire of it.  Jack Nicholson's portrayal of a man slowly descending into madness is amazing.  The child that played Danny is fantastic.  The sinister Overlook Hotel with it's monstrously long hallways, the rooms with God only knows in them, those terrifying twins...I'm always amazed to hear how King hated this movie and of all the criticism it receives.

The casting of Scatman,to my mind, was, along with the casting of Nicholson, sheer genius. From the spinechilling music playing during the first frames of the movie as the car winds up to thehotel to the very last frame as the 20s themed music plays and the camera zeros in onNicholson's figure at the center of the black and white photograph, the movie delivers.Stephen King purists can argue all they want over how true the film stayed to the book.I'm a King fan through and through, and I believe Kubrick's version is outstanding.

It should have been, ""All thrills and no faithfulness to the novel make Stephen a pissed author.""Kubrick's expert crafting of shocker-films has been well known for years; we know this from 'Clockwork Orange,' already. But as far as book ADAPTATIONS, ""The Shining"" is a failure. This is not to say, however, that ""Shining"" is a poorly made FILM.First off, the sets and location for the Overlook Hotel could not have made more perfect marks on the scare-scale. Particularly the scene (which will definitely turn your insides) where Jack ventures into the mystery room, and meets the hag in the bathtub, is brilliantly suspenseful. Climactic moments that rely on the sets are the maze chase between Jack and his PSI-cursed son, and the corresponing sub-scene where Duvall becomes lost in the haunted manor and encounters the infamous elevator lobby. FYI, the Overlook's snowbound exteriors were filmed on location in an actual Colarado residence. Interiors, however, were constructed sound-sets.What Scatman Crothers was doing in a flick like this is beyond me, but Nicholson and Duvall along with the undercredited son Lloyd, show true talent, and dish out the chills and thrills with the slight of a stroke of lipstick (((REDRUM))).Nicholson's hacking of the bathroom door with his axe is one of the most memorable cinematic moments brought to the big-screen,(""HEEEEERRRE'S JOHNNY!"") and audiences everywhere are still screaming.Finally, one can thank the gore department for keeping in balane with the plotline. Moments to watch for here, folks, are Danny's delusional trike ride down the hotel corridors, the bathtub scene, and of course, the death of Crothers' character.If you don't jump out of your seat to go throw up, you'll at least get some serious goosebumps and chills. Kubrick's knack with freaking us out was alive then, and isn't dead yet.As for the bad news, Stephen King fans will abandon the feature before the first twenty minutes. 'Carrie' holds truer to it's book than this one. But whoever said book-to-movie projects were easy, guys? Give Stan a break, please. The plotline is of course, dramatically simplified, but that's half the fun. Those who haven't read the novel--like myself--probably won't throw thier popcorn at the TV as hard as King-fanatics may.Like I said, it'll scare the living hell out of it's viewer, maybe even cause you hide all sharp objects from your hubby for safety. If your like classic nightmare-inducing thrillers, and enjoy the talent of Jack Nicholson, you've met your match.

There are many differences between the too. This DVD (from 2010) contains is a reprint of the original camera negative which was shot in 4:3 aspect.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1N4M3L6IFTI30	"M. Mclain ""liqwidfrog"""	Okay, for starters, ignore both of the 'star' reviewers.The Shining is not availible in wide screen, because it was not filmed in wide screen.  Neither were Eyes Wide Shut or Full Metal Jacket.  When they are shown wide screen in theatres, the top and bottom have been truncated.And as if it has not been stated enough, this movie doesn't follow the book.  Everyone always states that as if it is so surprising.  There is a great story about Kubrick calling up Stephen King at 3 am and asking him 'Do you believe in God' and when King said yes, Kubrick said 'I thought so' and hung up.Why is this significant?  Every change that Kubrick made was to totally remove the religious conscience that hides behind the words in the book.  Kubrick presents us with an entirely atheistic and amoral film where Jack Torrence never comes around to save his son's life, and in his typical manner he heavily deletes details to make the story ambigious.  He also down plays the supernatural element (for example, instead of having hedge animals come to life, (which is sort of stupid) he instead has Jack chase Danny through a hedge maze.  It sounds at first as if it wouldn't be as interesting, but it is a very effective scene)  I do not recommend ever reading any of the books that Kubrick based his films on; just like with Hitchcock, he was very good at taking a hack writer and producing a great film from it.  (Verdi excelled at this also, only not films)  Also it is to your best interest to laugh a lot when you watch this film.  It is one of the funniest movies ever, and if you don't appreciate the humor, you'll never be scrared of the film.  (The scene in the car, where Jack tells Danny that he should have eaten his breakfast is an absolute classic)  Also, unlike every other horror movie in the world, this one gets scarier the more you watch it.As for the comments about the removal of material from the book explaining the images, see 2001 A Space Odyssey.  Kubrick enjoyed finishing his films, and then drastically cutting them.  We are accustomed to having every detail explained to us, and Kubrick doesn't do that.  He doesn't feel it's necessary to make us understand how and why all of these things happen.  An interesting note: the average ratio of film shot to film kept for a film is about 1:5 to 1:10.  For the shining it was something like 1:250... meaning for every 250 reels of film Kubrick shot, he kept one.  Realize that when you watch it; every single shot is exactly as he wanted it.  Also, in the words of Stephen King, Kubrick liked to make films that hurt people--it's a very good observation	5.0	Do you believe in God?  I thought so	2004-09-22	20	16	4

I think bashing someone's brains in qualifies for ""hurting"" someone hehe. The most disgusting scene in this film was when he went up to the room where the woman who supposedly straggled danny was, and jack sees a beautiful naked woman in the bathtub, and she gets out and begins kissing him, and he suddenly felt that something was wrong and glances in the mirror to see what he was REALLY kissing and caressing, and it was an old women, who's body was deceased and rotting from the decomposition, and the water was all gross and her skin was falling off with huge brown patches of missing skin. And that horrible deranged laugh that was constant as she tried following him out of the room, kinda scary if you see this for the first time and don't expect it hehe. That scene makes me wanna hurl, and i think the movie the faculty copied that scene when the old woman walked into the shower room, and her skin was also loose rotting and gross, anyways lol. This film gets under your skin, no pun intended, and the parts when it showed the twin girls chopped up and bloody use to scare me as a kid. This was indeed a successful horror film, and many movies stole ideas from the shining, but werent successful anyway.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	Realised as a masterpiece of its genre, The Shining incorporates everything a horror movie should have and then some.  Telling the story of Jack Torrance's rapid descent into madness and homicidal impulses towards his family as they look after the Overlook Hotel during the winter, it's very effective in telling its story.  Seeing ghosts and growing more and more unhinged, Jack's character is perfectly balanced by that of his son Danny, who has 'the shining', a rare gift which allows him psychic powers and an insight into the history of the creepy hotel.As the lead character, Jack Nicholson is about as close to perfect as you can possibly be, and in such a movie it would be easy to solely concentrate on him.  However, thanks to the winning performances by Duvall as his wife and that of the child Danny, we are also made to worry for the safety of his family.  Duvall's wide-eyed performance is masterful, implying not only innocence and vulnerability but also the cold determination to protect her son.  The boy who plays Danny is also immensely talented in a role today that would seem tailor-made for Haley Joel Osmont.  His terror and innocence are emphasised to the max, although interestingly enough the actor never continued a career in film-making.Many people have criticised The Shining due to the fact that it isn't very faithful to the book.  Scenes such as the hedge animal attack aren't included and there's a completely different ending.  However, both are really excellent in their own way and if Kubrick's film isn't a by the letter adaptation of Stephen King's novel then it at least follows it in spirit.  The grim and gory hallucination and psychic vision scenes are genuinely horrific, in particular the woman who rises from the bathtub only for Jack to realise that she's dead.  Many of these have become a much-parodied part of pop culture, especially the lift that opens with a gush of blood, and rightly so too.  This is generally regarded as one of Kubrick's best films, and it probably is.  It's original, scary, disturbing and brilliantly acted.  Not only that but it's an adult horror picture, a genre that is so few and far between that it has all but become extinct.	4.0	Horror is rarely this good	2003-01-14	2	1	1

Reeves	"Since I suspect that most people reading this have already seen ""The Shining"" and already have an opinion, I'm not going to comment on the plot.  Instead I'm going to review the extra features.""Crafting the Shining"" - This was the first DVD extra that I watched, and I enjoyed it a lot.  I thought it was a concise, well done look behind-the-scenes with a lot of interesting trivia and interviews.""Visions of Stanley Kubrick"" - This is a short homage to Kubrick.  It looks at all of his films to showcase the sort of artist he was.""Making of the Shining"" - This is the exact same documentary as on the ""Collection"" VHS tape.  However, a nice addition is the option of listening to a new commentary by Vivian Kubrick.  I enjoyed hearing her stories.  She had the unique perspective of being a 17 year old bystander on the set.  I wish they had asked her to take part in the commentary for the full movie on disc 1.""Wendy Carlos"" - This is an interesting look at the musical sequences that didn't make it into the final cut of The Shining and Clockwork Orange.Disc 1 special features - The only extra feature on disc 1 is the commentary by the steadycam operator and a Kubrick biographer.  This commentary is why I gave the dvd only 4 stars instead of 5.  The biggest disappointment was that they repeat a lot of what was already said in the extra features on Disc 2.  The two commentators were recorded separately and then spliced together.  The steadycam operator was humorous to listen to and he also keeps you interested because of his unique perspective as a crew member on set almost every day during filming.  The biographer's commentary, on the other hand, was disappointing.  A few of his comments were insightful, but everyone watching with me felt he sounded pompous.  A lot of his comments sound like an art critic fawning over Kubrick while pointing out the obvious.  Suffice to say, I wish they had paired the steadycam operator up with someone different for the commentary.  It's a shame they couldn't get Nicholson or one of the other actors to provide commentary.  I would have enjoyed it more listening to a second person who had actually been there during filming.Overall, I felt it was worth paying the extra money for this 2 disc dvd as an upgrade from my old VHS copy.  The picture quality looks good.  I'm happy with my choice.  But anyone who isn't a huge fan will probably be completely satisfied with the cheaper 2001 ""Kubrick Collection"" dvd instead.  You are basically paying the big price difference for this special edition only to get 3 short featurettes, Vivian's 30 minute commentary, and a very mediocre full-length commentary.  According to Amazon's editorial, the old ""Collection"" version was supposedly the aspect ratio that Kubrick approved of, anyways.A five star movie, but only a four star ""special"" edition."	4.0	DVD extras	2008-07-13	4	3	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2GXZLY45DISGX	Mr. M. Thompson	I've just received this from the USA this morning [ I live in England ] and the first thing I had to do was compare the 'cropping' of this new DVD edition with the DVD from 2001 [ which was full screen flat ] , which I bought in Illinois, where I worked at the time.The short answer is:  you're either gonna love it, or hate it.Personally, I prefer the 2001 disc; what you're seeing there is the fully-exposed camera image, before the cropping that took place in the cinema, when the movie you were watching was projected, as per Kubrick's [ apparent ] wishes.The problem with this new re-formatting, is that you lose information from the top and bottom of the frame - and it doesn't look right, it feels squashed and uncomfortable.The image is less sharp than the 2001 transfer, too - not greatly, but it's definitely there, and those of us with an eye for these things will notice it.The saving grace though is the commentary by Baxter and Garrett Brown, the Steadicam operator on 'The Shining'.  Tremendous!  Full of insights into the production from Garrett, Baxter's comments being largely redundant.A second disc has three new featurettes, which are interesting as far as they go, but nothing particularly illuminating or special.  Ironically, the fourth ' Special Feature' on this second disc, is the best by far - Vivian Kubrick's masterful documentary on her father's film, which was previously on the 2001 edition.The long and short of it is this:  Like the Ultimate Editions of the Bond movies from last year, if you're a true fan, you'll want both versions - but KEEP AHOLD OF YOUR 2001 EDITIONS !	4.0	Warner's Controversial Ratio Decision !	2007-10-20	9	8	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AIYVWFDN3EIYX	M. R. Pachankis	Having suffered through King's novel, I apprecaite the movie all the more. Kubrick cuts out all the unnecessary background clutter and replaces the  asinine killer topiary animals with the topiary maze.  Watching Nicholson  and Duvall's transformation is creepy. Kubrick doesn't depend on cheap  scares and cliches. He uses the mental breakdown of his subjects to draw us  in to his eerie vision.	5.0	An eerie story culled from a long, boring novel	2000-08-06	4	1	3
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1BRR1IMEC3Q76	Mr. S. Grant	The book is better than the film but the film itself is far more satisfying. This is probably the only film in the world that really gave me nightmares with its creepy shots of the hotel and the two girls. The scariest scenes for me where the old woman in the bathtub and the last shots of the girls. I think that certain aspects of the script are so well written and Jack Nicholsons performance is A1. You really have to sympathise with poor Jack for the monster he is turned into.  Now my rants.1. The film was shot in 4'3 so you are getting the full picture aspect and you see even more than the cinema version which was cropped at the top and bottom. Any wide screen version that may come out in the future will be cropped just the same. It is an impossibility to get an anamorphic or letterbox edition of this film so you people should really learn a few things. JFK was transferred to widescreen like this and blatently had black lines stuck over at the top and bottom. 2. It was originally recorded in mono sound being 1979-80 and was played theatrically like this. This edition was overseen by Kubrick himself and the point of it is to restore it to how it originally was not to make any modifications. Splitting up mono tracks always takes the depth away from the sound. 3. The picture has been restored suitably enough and shows a gritty image the same as Aliens did. The picture is fine and I cant imagine it ever looked this good before. There. No more waiting for a true version which you make believe will come out some day because I dont ever think there will ever be another. GREAT FILM BY THE WAY.	5.0	Lets get a few things straight here!!!	2001-02-17	5	4	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2H22I2RWE0HOV	Mr. Sinister	As with most projects like this, there are two distinct versions of The Shining.  There is the novel by Stephen King, and then there is the movie directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring the phychotic superman Jack Nicholson.  Two very distinct versions.  I love them both.  Now, what we need to understand for the purists is that you should never compare the book with the movie, especially here, because they barely resemble each other.  Stanley Kubrick was a prick.  Great filmaker, but a prick.  I read a story about how he called Stephen King up at three o'clock in the morning and asked him if he believed in God, then hung up when King answered the question.  Weird.  What Kubrick couldn't comprehend about King's novel is obvious.  Jack Torrence is an out-of-work semi-retired-alcoholic who's had a tough time of making things go his way.  He's been fired from his last job for nearly killing a student who slashed his tires.  Anyway, Jack here is an average Joe with a bit of a drinking problem and a bit of a temper problem, but otherwise okay.  He goes mad.  One step at a time he goes bonkers.  Now...the second we see Jack Nicholson, we think he's insane, because that's what Jack does to us.  The Overlook hotel wants Danny Torrence because of his gift of clairvoyance.  It uses his father to get him.  In the movie it seems as if the hotel is just haunted and Jack is insane and he's got a bunch of ghosts telling him to kill off his family.  Kewel.  Stepping away from the Stephen King version, you gotta love The Shining.  Jack Nicholson is awesome as everyone's favorite lunatic.  Great suspense.  Creepy music and scenery.  The Shining has it all.  Just stay away from comparing it to the book and you'll be okay.And remember: Wendy, darling, light of my life!  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I'm not going to hurt you.  I'm just gonna bash your brains in.  I'm gonna bash 'em right the f*ck in!Dig it!	5.0	The Shining: King vs. Kubrick	2006-03-21	11	4	7
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A9A8T7I5VO6H9	Mrs. Mia Wallace	"This Kubrik directed adaption of the Stephen King novel is actually better than the book in my opinion.  Kubrik gets right to the heart of the story and eliminates the unnecessary fluff that is in King's version.  The soundtrack also sets the mood and helps contribute to the gripping pace.The young actor who plays Doc is excellent.  The scenes between him and Jack Nicholson early in the film are so touching.  The boy has such a maturity about him that is really amazing.Shelley Duvall as well is such a fine actress, she is very underrated.  Included in the DVD version is a commentary where you can see how she was definitely treated as a ""second fiddle"" to Jack Nicholson as the ""star.""  This obviously bothered her, but she used that frustration in her work and it only served to better her performance.Scatman Crothers is incredible and serves as a catalyst to get the story to the next level.  I believe this was his last screen role.What more can be said about Jack Nicholson's performance?  This man is one of our more talented actors and plays this role about as over the top as you can get.  He chews the scenery down to the nub, but that is what was required here.  The character of Jack Torrance goes insane over the course of the film and Jack Nicholson sells us on it, with every glare, cocked eyebrow, and cheesy grin.This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again and still see something new to enjoy.  It is a complete American masterpiece."	5.0	Rare Movie That is Better Than the Book	2006-03-08	15	11	4

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AWFKJX7IUQQ31	Mr. Truth	"Jack Nicholson in the movie, I would grab the ax and certainly smash Kubrick's camera into pieces for turning one of the best horror books around into a bag of silliness, including hysterical Wendy, lousy Danny and his friend ""Tony"" (talking to his finger, oh my GOD) and unnecessarily over-the-top-performance for Jack, who seemed to be crazy since the day he was born. Where is the subtle psychological horror the book eminates so much? Where is the disintegration of a family man surrendering to lack of will and alcohol? Where is his failure in pulling things off no matter how much he wants to? Where is the symbolism the hotel represents? No horror, no drama, no story...Sorry guys, this film is praised only by incurable devotees of Stanley Kubrick and unfortunately they must be blind...because they cannot see how much this crap is a total travesty. In its own, as one of the reviewers here said, it may be a nice little horror flick but nothing else...some nice somehow-frightening scenes and nothing more.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	ADJR1DU42TVCS	M. Skwiat	I was so scared to watch this when I was a kid.  It's not a very bloody film, but the atmosphere and that feeling of isolation seeps into your mind as you watch it.  Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors, and he does not disappoint in this film.  He plays a struggling writer over looking a hotel with his wife and son for the winter.  From there he begins a descent into madness or was he already mad to begin with?  This are the questions you will struggle with as you watch.Stanley Kubrick creates a beautiful looking film which takes on greater meaning with repeat viewings.  The last time I watched the film I focused on the colors used in the film, especially the use of the color red.  Kubrick is a master of film making, and with this film he was able to prove that horror could be just as artful as other films.  The Shining is a classic and should not be missed!	5.0	Heeeeeeeeere's...... My review!	2011-07-18	3	3	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	ARZIV5UMPT8NE	M Suarez	I hadn't ever had the pleasure of seeing the Shining up until a couple of years ago. It had a good reputation but movies based on Stephen King books have a certain stigma attached to them that I am sorry to say I mostly find to be well-deserved. However, the Shining is different.Jack Torrance is a man who is looking for a change of scenery. It is hinted at that he has his share of demons that he is trying to escape. He gets a position as the winter caretaker for the grandiose Overlook Hotel, located deep in the mountains and inaccessible to most folk for about five months of the year. He and his family move in, but all is not well. The Overlook has some uneasy ghosts that have their own evil agenda, and Jack seems to be just the instrument of destruction they're looking for.Jack's son Danny is a special little boy who has psychic abilities, and the hotel wants him on its side. Can Wendy, Jack's wife, save her child and herself from the hotel - and her husband?The Shining is impressive on quite a few levels: there is an atmosphere of tension throughout the whole movie that really draws you in, the casting is excellent, wonderful performances are turned in by all, and though it was released in 1980 and the clothing and styles are definitely from that time, the picture holds up admirably, rarely feeling dated. This is a picture that a lot of the more recent horror/suspense films could learn something from. You don't need gratuitous sex and violence to make a good horror film, and a lot of gore won't cover up a lack of plot or forgetting to firmly establish the proper mood to scare the pants off your audience. Not to say that the Shining is devoid of sexual overtones and violence of any kind - because it isn't, this one is not appropriate for the children - but it doesn't throw them at you repeatedly to distract you from the fact that it sucks.If you've got any interest in being scared or you just want to see a really well-made film, watch the Shining. And for all you Stephen King fans who cringed at Christine, Sleepwalkers and the end of It, this one should be on your list.	5.0	Oh So Creepy	2013-01-28	1	1	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A27TC5T7DUWTP	Music fan	Wow!That's my lasting impression of Stanley Kubrick's complete  Masterpiece of Psychological Terror. I first saw this movie when I was 11  years old(1981). It confused me greatly, but intrigued me at the same  time.Jack Nicholson was amazing in a role NO ONE ELSE could have played.  Shelley Duvall was miscast and out of her league, but it doesn't really  affect the movie that much, because besides Jack, Danny(the young son)  Lloyd is unbelievable in what had to be a very difficult role for such a  young boy. But the real star of this movie is THE OVERLOOK HOTEL. Kubrick's  amazing use of the camera adds to the eerie,isolated and extremely spooky  setting. The result is a psychological drama that is, in a word...SURREAL.  It is a long movie, but it never gets dull, it keeps you on the edge of  your seat with one eerie scene after another. I read this book long after I  saw the movie, the book was good, but the movie is better. Kubrick takes  King's novel to places that King himself couldn't have dreamed of. A  totally hypnotic tour de force by one of history's most underrated  directors and genius minds. Next to THE EXORCIST, this is the best horror  movie I've ever seen.	5.0	One of the 2 best horror films ever!	2000-05-25	4	2	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A18Y9NYMGH7TO0	M. Williamson	The only reason he preferred 1:33 for video release was TVs were at that time 1:33 and he thought the letterboxing made the image too small.But now TVs are an approximation of the 1:85 theatre aspect ratio, so the films should be presented on DVD as they were conceived.  Kubrick composed the shots for THE SHINING to be 1:85.Think about it...Having a 1:33 image on your widescreen TV is EXACTLY the kind of letterboxing Kubrick didn't want...Black bars around the image making it smaller.So chill out...This is how it's meant to be seen.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1CZU433IGLKR2	N. Barnes	Throughout Kubrick's creative life as a filmmaker he was drawn to using pre-existing music as an ingredient to heighten emotional effect. Most strikingly his use of Johann Strauss and Richard Strauss in &quot;2001  Space Oddessy&quot; amongst others has given this element popular appeal  and been a memorable aspect of his works power. In &quot;The Shining&quot;  Kubrick use the music of Bella Bartok, Gyorgy Ligeti and Krzysztof  Penderecki in a more precise and detailed way than in his previous films.  The music here cannot in any way be regarded as a film score in the  traditional sense. The music by the three composers aforementioned are well  established and parts of the contemporary orchestral repertoire, and were  written with no connection what so ever to Stanley Kubrick's film. It is  unlikely that anything other than a small minority of filmgoers would be  familiar with the music of Ligeti or Penderecki, and so would not recognise  immediately, if at all. that this work exists successfully in itself in its  own right. It sounds very much like an ordinary successful film score with  the usual subliminal and emotional effect that a composed score is designed  to produce. Kubrick's use of Bartok is however a little more risky in this  effect. Though not a popular piece of classical music it is one which a  good many people would be familiar with. It is a masterpiece of 20th  century musical composition. It is probable that Kubrick was aware of this  in his credit of the pieces full title at the end of the film, which he  fails to make with regards to Ligeti or Penderecki. The Bartok piece here  in question is his &quot;Music for strings, percussion and celesta&quot;.  It was written in 1936 and has no programmatic element. As a music lover,  it is likely that Kubrick would have been very familiar with this piece.  Bartok's music has a particular sound world which comprises a number of  elements, particularly in the third movement of this piece which is a fine  example of what is known as his &quot;Night Music&quot;. The Night Music  often made up the intense slow movements of his most important works,  particularly his string quartets, regular features of which are atmospheric  special effects produced by string instruments (Glissandi, Pizzicato,  Harmonics and Tremolos) which contribute to a feeling of dreamlike  unreality. This music has often been described as &quot;nightmarish&quot;  or &quot;supernatural&quot; in its effect. It is likely that Kubrick was  drawn to this expression of psychological darkness as part of his creative  process. Ligeti and Penderecki have also developed the use of these musical  techniques in their own work using Bartok as an antecedent thus making  their music relevant and organic as the score to this film. The composition  of a film score is normally the very last creative part of a project. A  film composer would compose music timed, frame by frame, second by second,  to an existing edited version of the completed film, which impose  particular limitations upon the artists creative expression. No such  limitations however were imposed upon the composition of the music already  mentioned, which reflects in its complex quality, so in choosing  particularly the Bartok, Kubrick would have to reverse the process and  create much of his film around an already established dramatic concept. In  a documentary film &quot;The Making of The Shining&quot; by Vivienne  Kubrick, there are examples of rehearsal and shoots where the actors are  audibly aware of the music that they are acting with. In this sense Kubrick  could be described as a choreographer and his actors as dancers. It is  likely that Nicholson and Duvall would have familiarised themselves with  the music in order to better time certain actions and lines and rehearsed  intensely in order to achieve the precision required. There are several  examples of this precision which could not have been achieved in any other  way and are beyond coincidence: the swiping out of paper from Jack's  typewriter; Jacks waving of hands through the hotel corridors; the  punctuation of Danny's question to his father in the bedroom; Danny's  ice-slide from the bathroom window (illustrated with help from Penderecki's  Glissando, itself a slide on string instruments). These are just some  examples of the relationship between the actors and the music. In other  parts of the film the relationship is between film editor and music and  would have been achieved in the editing studio. The whole general effect of  these techniques is one of precision and power and must certainly have been  a fundamental element of Kubrick's entire creative process in this project.  It was a unique and original way of working with film. As a result of this  process Kubrick was able to produce scenes in relation to particular  sections of music which look very much like tableaux, like scenes from  ballet. The emergence of the ghostly nude woman from the bath in room 237  to Penderecki's music is a particularly fine example of this choreography.  Kubrick's choices, understanding and directional mastery with regards to  the music make these techniques absolutely successful in their effect.  Without this musical element &quot;The Shining&quot; could not have had its  full effect. The music chosen has a surrealism all of its own. When it is  heard the viewer knows that something supernatural is about to develop. The  narrative steps out of reality and enters its own dream world. Kubrick owes  a debt to the genius of his composers.	5.0	The music IS the Shining!	2000-03-31	3	3	0

I think this is Kubrick's last great movie. That said, this is a terrific rewrite of the horrible Stephen King novel, which means it's actally scary. Kubrick knew how to make terrifying films, and this is no exception. Jack Nicholson is great in his role, and I do believe they got the timing right when he goes crazy. Yes it's early in the film, but he spent 4-5 months in that hotel before he snapps. Shelly Duvall is perfect for the scared mother, and the images are very disturbing. Especially the quick flash with the two twins. Also, there are plently of 'Long Shots,' as I call them, that Kubrick uses in every film he's done. The music is also creepy.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2MXWQEHDD67LB	Nicole Alleyne	I had the opportunity to read the book before I watched the movie because although I wasn't allowed to watch horrors I was encouraged to read and Stephen King has been a favorite of mine since I found &#34;Thinner&#34; in the school library in Form 2. I was thirteen and all I wanted to know was who was this Richard Bachman guy? and where can I find more stuff by him?The book was disturbing, seen from the point of view of a young boy who can't express to his parents what he sees, smells, hears while watching his father slowly slip into insanity, being absorbed into the hotel horror show.The movie was similar but different. There is a lot of internal dialogue that can't be expressed and I accept that. But you still get to watch the young boy struggle and you want to help him, you really do. You think &#34;Do this,&#34; or &#34;why don't you tell that person what is going on.&#34; But you know he can't cause it won't help anybody, especially not him. The end is inevitable from the beginning. So you watch the ghosties and the gore and you feel as helpless as the poor kid. And then the dad snaps. Snap! Oh, S#!t. And we're off. Things take a decidedly downward turn for everybody after that. The mother's reaction is believable. Can't say I blame her for screaming her nuts off. And the end, good stuff.Well played Mr. Director. Not quite the same as the book but just as satisfying. I saw it again the other night (why does this seem to show at night?) and it was just as good for me as the first time. Mmmm. Well done.	5.0	Best Horror EVERRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!	2014-05-13	0	0	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1SS5GO4DT752R	"Nicole ""rockinrenee"""	I watch this movie every Halloween.  It is my favorite horror movie.  Stanley Kuprick's panning shots of the overlook hotel and the mountain that surrounds it, especially in the beginning, really give you a sense of alienation that chills you to the bone.  I can't imagine being so isolated for so long.  Also, Kuprick's constant close ups of Jack while he is going insane really give you the creeps and the close-ups of Shelley Duvall's terrified face make you as scared as she seems.  (No one was better for these roles than Nicholson and Duvall)  Jack was so much better in this role than Stephen Weber was in the mini-series on TV (no offense to Weber, it's a hard act to follow).  The young boy who plays Danny in this movie does an excellent job of blanking out of this world and into the world of his visions.  He makes this extraordinary power of his seem very believable.  The only problem I had with the movie was that it didn't go into enough explanation about some things, like why 237 is haunted and who the guy in the dog costum is, but that might be why it is so scary.  The book explains these things better though, if you are curious.  Also, I thought showing Jack in the 1920's picture in the hotel at the ending was a nice touch that was not in the book.  It makes you think that the Overlook has possessed his spirit, if the movie didn't already give you that idea.  This is a classic must watch for any true horror movie fan, not the type that just likes the pointless slasher flicks like Friday the 13th.  I know Stephen King was disappointed with this film, but I don't care.  It is fantastic!	5.0	Now This is What a Scary Movie Should Be!	2003-10-23	6	2	4

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A16IXZW2A0NFR6	NIVEK	This movie is an assualt of isolation similar to the equally great 1982 remake of the Thing. This movie weaves it's web of terror slowly and digs its claws into you. Jack Nicholson is way over the top in this movie but I don't think it takes away from the film in fact it adds a little sense of camp to it. The hotel itself is the star of this movie though, and the cinemotography is top notch. Stanley Kubrick always tended to be somewhat mechanical and detached from the emotions onscreen as it is in the Shining, but the coldness adds to the bleak terror of it. The book is a lot different in the tone it sets and is also excellent. This movie version stands better on its own than as an adaptation of the novel. REDRUM.	5.0	A Masterwork	2005-08-10	3	1	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	"If you're new to ""The Shining"" and intend to read the book and see the film, for goodness sake don't read the book first. Stephen King's novelThe Shiningis a very different enterprise, the experience of which will colour your expectations for Stanley Kubrick's film.The novel uses traditional narrative tools of written fiction - as you'd expect: we are led into a complex story through richly drawn characters whose dilemma is examined through metaphor and figurative structure. King's outstanding achievement was to deliver such intellectual richness in the context of such a barnstorming yarn. Other thanThomas Harris, I can't think of another writer who comes close (though if anyone has other suggestions please let me know!).Stanley Kubrick - he of, most comparably,2001: A Space Odyssey(notably also ostensibly a dramatisation of apopular novelfrom a ""pulp fiction"" genre) - was an artiste of a completely different medium: a cineaste: by no means simply (or at all) a dramatiser of written literature.  And, like 2001, this film is not an adaptation of its source material, but a jumping-off point; the equivalent of a musical variation on a theme extracted from - based upon - King's novel. An essence is retained, but much of the narrative superstructure of the novel simply isn't here. The setting becomes simply the context for an entirely different  sort of statement, built out of different material: images and sounds, rather than words.Thus, while we see scenes from the novel extracted almost verbatim, they are often delivered entirely devoid of context and absent of their consequences in the novel.So through a series of arresting images we see Dick Halloran leave Miami and voyage by plane, car and snowmobile to the Rockies, only to be immediately cut down, without serious investigation of why, or the tribulations and mental torment book describes in his getting there. We see Jack Torrance's yellow beetle crawling up to the Outlook, like a wasp to the nest, but not the dilapidated condition of the car, a state which, in King's novel, stands in for the state of Jack's mind and marriage. Jack's alcoholism is tangentially referred to, once, but is not otherwise explored. Shelley Duvall's Wendy is reduced to a feeble, shrieking wreck, without any of the strength or fortitude portrayed in the novel.  I am prepared to give Stanley Kubrick the benefit of the doubt and grant that this was entirely intentional. That isn't to say it is necessarily successful.The trouble is, I don't think Kubrick's approach, in this case, works - whereas it undoubtedly did in 2001. What we are left with is beautiful cinematography, disconcerting camera angles, a complex sound stage and high-budget production design, but little to ruminate on and nothing the quicken the pulse. It's occasionally spooky, but never scary. There are fine set pieces, but Kubrick seems almost deliberately to defuse the thrills, even down to the constant bright lighting with which he floods his sets.I concede this might be my prejudgement, based on knowledge of the novel - showing through. It may be that the back-story and metaphor Kubrick elected to omit dispel necessary tension and uncertainty in the motion picture.But The Shining didn't feel like it had enough substance left for me, and I didn't understand easily the point of Kubrick's cleverness with this directing. I was left with the sense that the Shining is a dated film, perhaps more an artefact of its time than a genuinely great film.Olly Buxton"	3.0	Slim pickings at the Outlook Hotel	2009-10-05	6	2	4
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A5SA4C7P29KHP	"""oquinn"""	It's easy to see why Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick clashed over Kubrick's version of &quot;The Shining&quot; -- much of the horror of the  novel is lost with the omission of the sinister topiary animals and the  substitution of a garden maze; the culvert little Danny burrows into, only  to find himself not alone; Jack's use of an axe instead of a croquet-type  stick; and, what is absolutely criminal, the murder of the hotel chef  (Scatman Crothers), who was a hero in the novel, sensing Danny's distress  and driving across country to help a small bearer of a potent portion of  &quot;the shining,&quot; a telepathic kind of talent for sensing danger and  horror.Couldn't Kubrick stand the idea of a black man being a hero? In  the film, only Shelley Duvall remains to save Danny; in the book, Crothers  is with her, courageous beyond caution in his efforts to save her and  Danny, even though severely wounded by Mad Jack. As a radical feminist and  long-time civil rights supporter, I was pleased they both exerted efforts  that are usually beyond the ability of the human mind and body to  accomplish -- in the book, but left only to Duvall in the movie.The  elevator of blood was effective -- if you're frightened of blood. A really  great effect is reproduced from King's novel: the dead -- or is she? --  woman in the bathtub.Leaving out the little boy -- a ghost? -- who is  Danny's real informant of danger as part of Danny's &quot;shining&quot; and  having Danny's thumb -- or finger? -- waggle at him in warnng instead is  perhaps intentional comic relief. However, comic relief doesn't belong in  this story, and the strategy backfires because of its utter  silliness.All that said, &quot;The Shining&quot; is an extremely  frightening film. When a Jack Nicholson character goes nuts, you don't want  to be anywhere nearby. As his character, Jack Torrance, sinks into  psychosis under the malign influence of the hotel and its past denizens,  Nicholson gives one of the best performances of his career; who'd have  thought that enormous, mischievous, toothy grin could be so horrible, even  in the context of an insane character? But it is, and there's no way that  his grin, especially in the infamous scene in which Jack sticks his face  into a hole he's made in a door with his axe, while Duvall and the little  boy cower back, wouldn't scare the pants off the most stoic viewer. There  are still T-shirts bearing a close-up of Jack's face being sold.  &quot;Heeeeeere's Johnny!&quot; indeed!Duvall perfectly plays the kind  of woman King irritatingly and consistently characterized in his early  novels, seemingly the only kind of which he was aware: timid, ineffectual,  unable to act in her own behalf. But her character gets braver -- maternal  instinct, King seems to imply -- while remaining utterly terrified.  Kubrick, however, stresses her growing strength much more in the film.The greatest disappointment in the film version of &quot;The  Shining&quot; is the child playing Danny, an example of a casting mistake  with no excuse. The kid is boring. He has no personality. He's a  drag. You  don't give a damn about him, and don't understand why Duvall does, except  that she's his mother. He is not a lovable child. He's a zero.Crothers  is fine, fine, fine as the departing hotel chef, who notices and tells  Danny about his &quot;shine,&quot; and tells him to use it if he needs  help, because Crothers will come back if he does. And he's as good as his  word because he does come back, to achieve heroic stature in the novel but  to be summarily put down by Mad Jack in the movie. What a shame! I wonder  if that was one of King's objections to what Kubrick was doing with his  story.If you've never read the book, your first viewing of &quot;The  Shining&quot; ought to scare you sick. Otherwise, be prepared for  disappointment. Kubrick tarnished the shining of one of the best and  certainly one of the most graphic &quot;haunted house&quot; genre stories  ever written.	3.0	A tarnished &quot;Shining&quot;	2000-09-03	2	0	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	"This film has ONLY two things going for it. Kubrick meets Nicholson and the advent of the award winning cinematography technology - Stedicam&trade;. True Kubrick fans will agree that this is a highly overrated, undernourished, ill-plotted and inapt adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Even Stephen King agrees with that! The film is marred by an intolerably sluggish beginning and middle act that is supposed to build up to an all out finale of mad proportions. The truth is that it had all been done before in 1979 in an equally as well known film called - The Amityville Horror.The premise is simple. Husband, wife and kid move to a hotel for a snowy winter. Kid has the gift of the second sight, wife is just your average stereotypical ""nicey nice"" housewife, husband is working at the hotel to keep it running while the owners and the guests are away. He is also writing a book. The hotel turns out to be haunted. This slowly drives the husband insane. He then tries to kill his family with an axe and the wife and kid freak out of it in the process.The Amityville Horror is the original ""mad family axe man"" movie. It is also the original mad family axe man novel! Both novel and film precede King and Kubrick's vision of the exact same theme, except here you have a hotel that is haunted instead of a house. No points for originality there. You would do the original owners of this theme a great disservice by giving it to Kubrick and King instead.The entire film looks great because of the fluid Stedicam work that goes up the stairs, down the hall, and into every nook and cranny seamlessly. Nicholson does a great job of going insane and then absolutely crackers in the end. Everything else in this film is utterly tedious material that will try your patients to the very last thread. Kubrick did all of his ""one million takes"" to get that shot. Okay he got the shot, but he forgot entirely about the script and what makes a movie tick. We could say that it is all about the performances - but let us look at that more closely. The kid in this movie says very little and just usually looks scared or intrigued by something, but that is it. Shelley Duvall is the most clich&eacute;d driven character you will ever see. She does little more than attend to Nicholson's every demand in the most sterile of performances that ends up with her doing a lot of screaming. Obviously everybody was made to look dull in this film so that Nicholson's raving lunatic would eclipse their roles. Unfortunately Kubrick should have gone further and got Nicholson's performance to eclipse the entire movie. It goes nowhere near transcending the banality of its 143 minutes. The last 30 minutes is all insanity and chasing the family around with an axe. The other 113 minutes is sheer nothingness as people see a few ghosts and just visit places in the hotel. Nowhere does this film work itself out to excuse almost two hours of its pretentious, exaggerated, hollow setup - and that is all those two hours are. It is a big setup of the hotel, its haunted parts, more areas of the hotel and the family staying together in solitary.Don't by into the flamboyant grandiose big names that went along with this abhorrence of storytelling. The ending, which this whole movie is based on, does absolutely nothing to justify the rest of it. When you sit through this thing from start to finish you will see through its phoniness for what it is. When you couple that with the fact that it is a rip-off, it only lowers everything even more. That is why I give this a 1 star rating.As a fan of the genre this DVD goes where it should belong. Among the other awful direct to video horror movies that gather dust at the back of the shelf as testimony to the great horror films that sit in front of them for regular viewing and cover polishing."	1.0	Highly Over-rated Amityville Horror Rip-off.	2004-01-10	28	11	17

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A12JXHWUWK8OVB	Pamela Edwards	After seeing Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets I found out what a great actor he is so I decided to give The Shining another chance. I decided I really like this movie mostly because of him. My favorite part is when Jack as Jack Torrence mimics and makes fun of his wife after she reads the manuscript with the same sentence repeated and she is scared of him. Shelly Duvall irritates me especially during her crying scenes because she snorts like a pig. What I like about The Shining video version I bought is that before the actual film starts there is a documentary about the making of The Shining filmed by Stanley Kubrick's daughter Vivian. With this documentary you find out a little more about the real Jack Nicholson, but Shelly Duvall still irritates me even when she's just herself. There is a touching moment when Scatman Crothers is interviewed. Since I had seen The Shining before I saw Cuckoo's Nest in the past I didn't realize this was the second time for he and Jack to work together I thought it so neat to see him working with Jack again. My favorite song from the movie was &quot;Midnight With the Stars and You&quot; which was playing in the background in one scene of the movie, at the end, and continuing into the closing credits. If you are a Jack Nicholson fan and even if you're not I recommend this movie.	4.0	Giving it another chance	2001-04-28	2	0	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AJUEE2C2EJ0V3	Paperbackstash	"The Shining remains one of the best horror films ever made to date and there are several reasons why. One is that it's very character orientated. We grow to know the characters Jack, Wendy, and Danny well enough to care what happens to them, and also to live what they're experiencing. While Shelley is generally annoying, Danny is cute and well acted, and Jack is demented enough to steal every scene he's in.At his finest, his depiction of a stressed ex-alcoholic descending rapidly into madness is legendary. The showdown scenes with Jack finally snaps were well-orchestrated. His nutty state of mind was shown from the start, but he also had a humorous side (demented but still there) that came through. Duvall exhibits sheer terror to perfection; her mousy overly submissive nature may get on ones' nerves but this personality helps impel the movie along. The contrast between the strong and neurotic hubby and the uncertain, reluctant wife creates a deeper impact when the final showdown begins. She was my least favorite character, however, as I said before she tended to get on the nerves. Danny was a very effective little actor and knew how to be freaky when needed. The ""tony in the mouth"" was eerie.Another key factor was the total and utter isolation once the storm really hit. Cut off, eventually, from any outside help. And before this, cut off from any other human companionship whatsoever. A lot of movies explore the theme of cabin fever but it isn't always achieved like this. I wonder how the Wilderness family does it? I can easily see Skip going nuts and slaughtering his wife and the two annoying, unrealistic kids Jenny and Toby with an axe!Yet another excellent aspect was the scenery. Even the name - The Overlook - simple yet powerful - invokes a certain feeling. Not many of the rooms are shown in detail; the could have been done to either not confuse the audience with too much at once, or it could have been done to make the isolation even more effective, causing the hotel itself and the surroundings to seem more closed in, smaller, tighter spaces.For the hotel itself the inside shots were great, but the outside shots were just as effective. Such an ordinary looking location that somehow managed to transmit vibrations of gloom. The addition of the outside maze was nonesuch; I loved the scene where Jack was looking through the maze figurine and then it shot to where Danny and Wendy were actually playing in it. The maze was used to wrap up to a different type of ending. Instead of having the movie full of music every step of the way we have an eerie sense of silence; this, to me, is more frightening. When music is played it's perfect. Simple yet chilling.The concept of having the shining as a unique, psychic like gift was neat; I loved that plot sideline. Danny certainly wasn't your everyday kid. This story doesn't stick strongly to Kings book and comes out all the better for it; this is Kubricks version and I fell in love with it. So many people had read the book and knew what happened in it; seeing it in a different perspective on screen was refreshing. Two different versions that were still so much the same.There are some scenes that really stick out as galvanizing, but throughout the entire picture we're filled with a sense of dread and impending doom. The directing was superb; everything had that cold, institutional feel. Nothing was corny or comedic about THIS one. Since the movie didn't rely on gore or affects it will not age.All of this movie is a piece of art rather than simply fiction, beautifully unleashing a tragic and brutal story of a powerful, cryptic haunting that had always been there but was just waiting to be let out."	5.0	Amazing	2013-09-20	2	2	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2F2MOAFSQS2PP	Patrice Batyski	Having read The Shining, and been in turns moved to laughter, tears and of course, terror, I was prepared for a powerful movie.  It was - powerfully dreadful.  Stanley Kubrick missed the whole point of the book - the  humanity and the struggled against human and supernatural evil.  The  tragedy of the book was the gradual seducation of Jack Torrance back into  alcoholism and into the grip of the Hotel.  Jack Nicholson, a fine actor,  proved himself to be a USDA Grade One Ham, with his slobbering, capering  immediate descent into evil.  Wendy in the movie was a dishrag of a wife.  Stephen King has never written such a spineles woman character in any of  his books, let alone this one.  And what can I say about the idea of  Danny's &quot;friend&quot; Tony being his finger?  Nothing without getting  sick to my stomach.  And Scatman as Dick Halloran!  I don't know what  Kubrick was thinking, but for me he bore an uncomfortable resemblance to a  Step &amp; Fetch it.  He was the most strong, dignified character in the  book.  As he was portrayed, I would never believe Danny would take any  advice from him.  The chase scene at the end in the maze would have been a  clever touch in another movie; the true death scene of Jack Torrance and  the Hotel in the book was so moving and horrifying.  I liked nothing about  this movie.	1.0	The Shining	2000-05-07	61	32	29

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3HI2HBUS8MITB	Patrick Hall	THE SHININGPerhaps the most difficult of all these reviews is this one.  The Shining is not in any way an ordinary horror movie and it has a lot of room for interpretation.  At a little over two hours, it's a lengthy movie in a genre that usually emphasizes promptness.  But it is all worth it, for director Stanley Kubrick jams a ton of information into this film with a great end result.The plot can be summed up quite easily.  A family is hired by the Overlook Hotel to watch the place during the off-season in the winter.  The husband Jack has a history of violence and alcohol abuse, and his son Danny has what appear to be psychic abilities.  As the winter progresses, Jack looses his mental stability, Danny sees horrific visions of death, and wife Wendy tries to hold her family together.  This culminates with Jack experiencing total mental breakdown and attempting to kill his family.It would be typical if not for the fantastic story that is woven into this simple plot.  Jack's break is slow and deliberate.  There are strong insinuations that the hotel is seriously haunted and that the spirits that lie within have taken hold of Jack's mind.  Or it could be the stress of the winter that has caused his violent tenancies to reemerge.  There are lots of events that can sway you either way, so it's hard to tell.  This goes equally for many of the ghostly occurrences in the film.  You're never sure what is real, what isn't or who these apparitions are.What these supernatural events are is irrelevant.  What is important is that they establish an unsettling mood.  At no point do you ever feel like there is a spot in the hotel that is safe from these visitors.  Every corner, every room has the potential for ghostly happenings, especially considering that its just the three living souls in the place.  The isolation is unbearable at times and just the thought of being trapped in this building all winter long is frightening enough.  Even more frightening is the concept of being unable to escape these demons who lurk about.  It's like being a rat trapped in a snakes cage.The acting is spectacular.  Jack Nicholson is nuts in this role.  Of less regard I feel is the credit due to the Overlook itself.  In a strange way, the hotel is an actor.  The film wouldn't have been half as good if not for this place.  It suits the story perfectly with its maze-like floor plan, cavernous rooms and hallways, and overall engaging architecture.Kubrick put a great deal of thoughtful work into this film, and it deserves to be examined.  Every shot, every scene is well thought out and the result is a film that doesn't ever go overboard, but also gives you enough information to get its point across.  Where is seems to stop is at that place of complete understanding.  The movie will advance an idea, but stop before giving out enough information to draw a conclusion.  Some people may find this frustrating, but I think it makes it all the more creepy.  We'll never know the truth about what was going on at the Overlook and this heightens the effect.I think a lot of people shun The Shining because of its length and slow pacing.  Fact is, the movie slowly builds to its fantastic ending because it wouldn't have worked any other way.  If Jack just started going crazy after the first 30 minutes, it would have failed.  Kubrick builds a steady and consistent anxiety with every small detail and event rather than diving head first into blood and gore.  Every bit he gives us we add to an already rising tension about what is going to happen next, until of coarse Jack flips entirely.The Shining will be sure to entertain, but it is also thought provoking.  Pay attention to the details, think about the scenes.  It's the kind of movie that has a lot going on in the background and this will allow you to draw your own conclusions as to what this movie is trying to say and just what it all means.	4.0	The Overlook	2011-10-19	2	2	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A327YZ9EDPHDOQ	"PATRICK J.POWERS ""PAT POWERS"""	Jack Nicholson is one my favorite actors (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,A Few Good Men,Anger Management and his latest  coming soon,The Bucket Trip). I will admit The Shining stands as a movie in which horror comes alive thanks to Jack's role as Jack Torrance. He delivers a solid performance as the caretake along with his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd). A good beginning but the action picks up when cabin fever begins to set in on Mr. Torrance and, well, you have to find out for yourself.

If you do, I suppose that you will be shocked and amazed to learn that Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick are two different people. They likewise had two different ideas about this story, and made it very differently.Getting past this,I would just like to say that this is one of the most frightening movies out there, on par (in my mind) with The Silence of the Lambs and Strangers on a Train.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A37B3O457INKEA	Peter Kenney	THE SHINING is adapted from a Stephen King novel about a family whose father serves as caretaker of a summer resort hotel in Colorado during the winter. Jack Nicholson has the role of Jack Torrance, the slightly manic dad who goes completely insane as his life and those of his wife and son systematically spin out of control. To say that Jack Nicholson dominates the movie is an understatement.The only relief is provided by Scatman Crothers who furnishes a welcome counterweight to Nicholson. Scatman is a tower of strength and stability who almost saves the film from becoming too much Jack.Another memorable character is the hotel itself which takes possession of Nicholson and drives him crazy. It is hard to imagine a more forbidding and desolate place. Additional members of the cast include Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Barry Nelson.THE SHINING received no Oscar nominations. The big award winners in 1980 were ORDINARY PEOPLE, RAGING BULL and COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER.	4.0	Too Much Jack	2003-05-12	3	0	3

The evil spirits of the hotel stir up the fear and anger between Mom and Dad and eventually devours Dad, leaving Mom and Son to escape to an uncertain future.  Boy's psychic powers had him doubt the relocation all together.  His imaginary friend let him know ahead of time the idea was no good.

And I usually would never get thrilled when there are violent scenes (as when Jack here threatens the ""light of his life"" and their son), but one should be able to call Kubricks' version of ""The Shining"" a dark comedy as well as it is an epic horror movie. Jack Nicholson carrying the movie with his strong and amazing acting, while the actress behind ""his"" wife, Shelley Duvall, gives an impressive and intense performance as well.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AXV9GS0TMSVW	Poor Napoleon	Any Stanley Kubrick film is difficult to review because he was in a league of his own, directing films in his own way leaving little room for comparison.  While I've never cared for the way some of his films are acted neccessarily, I've always loved the way they've looked and the way the make you feel.  This makes Kubrick a suitable fit for the horror genre.  The Shining, to me, has always been the ideal horror film, taking familiar horror elements to a new level.While the film strays quite a bit from its source material, the ideal ingredients for the horror to take shape are there - mainly isolation and the cold of winter.  What better way to be scared then to be locked up in a large hotel for the winter where the phones don't work and Jack Nicholson can go nuts.The real star of this film is the camera though.  Kubrick has a thing for long takes and tracking shots.  The best shots in this film occur when Danny is in the hallway.  The classic shot  that haunts me to this day is when Danny is riding his tricycle through the hallway revealing the forever eerie twin sisters.The rest of the action is fairly predictable once Jack starts going nuts, and while Kubrick doesn't really stretch the paramaters of the story, his eye for creating horrific landcapes with his lens in the all too sterile Overlook Hotel are gripping to this day.  Add to that the tense score by Wendy Carlos and you have an unforgettable horror masterpiece.	5.0	Still gives me the creeps	2007-10-31	2	1	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A361HWF14PW1W3	popinjay	Kubrick vs. King? Both King's novel and Kubrick's film are creative powerhouses. Those wanting drama in the way of Jack Torrance's alcoholism won't find as much of it here as in the novel. The cases made in the editorial and customer reviews about Jack being a loon from the start are a little overstated. In the film, it's clear Jack's problems originated from his drinking and that they spiral downward into attempted murder due to the darker side of his nature as egged on by the memory-specters within the Overlook. While creatively altered, enough of the spirit of the story has been maintained. Films aren't novels and there have been far less faithful cinematic adaptations of source material before and since this one was made.And while this film did omit some great aspects of the novel (e.g. the dogman), it has several goodies of its own. The best little nugget here? Phillip Stone as Delbert Grady.  A minor flaw within King's work is this character, and Kubrick corrected it.  King greatly emphasized the foreshadowing of this character, only to present a nonchalant, rather underwhelming tone for Grady's great dialogue. In Kubrick's film this star part is treated more appropriately, and results in one of the best stare down scenes on film, beautifully shot and expertly acted. Even avid detractors of this film shouldn't fail to acknowledge the merits of this scene.Regardless of some content discarded from King's work, Kubrick certainly caught King's vibe. The scene in the novel with Danny playing in the snow and sensing the ghost of the little boy isn't in this film, but it assuredly found its way into Kubrick's inspiration. That he expounded on this and transmuted the story into a creative vehicle of his own should not be regarded as a slight to Stephen King or his novel. Rather, it should be seen as an example of how a great story can be capable of inspiring a great variation.	5.0	"""You are the caretaker."""	2011-01-05	7	5	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2GEBXWGCYGHQG	Psyche86	By far, one of the best horror films ever made, Stanley Kubrick brings to life the haunting bestseller by Stephen King. Jack Nicholson is at his best, as the recovering alcoholic and winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. His wife, Wendy, and son Danny reside in the isolated hotel with him as he attempts to finish his novel. Given, the movie leaves out many key concepts of the book, Jack's violent history being the most significant, but Kubrick has a way of filming like no one else. His films are based on visuals, not on dialogue. The often overused saying, &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words,&quot;  is truly the essence of this movie.Kubrick's style of moviemaking was perfect for this film, and no director could have managed to do it better. Many of the most notorious movie scenes in history were created for this film, especially the &quot;blood in the elevator&quot; scene. True, this film is frightening and disturbing, but also an amazing work of art by one of the greatest directors of all time.	5.0	In my top 10 of all time	2002-10-05	2	1	1

There was a 2 minute scene between the scene where Jack Torrance freezes at the end,  and the shot of the picture of the guests from the hotel in the early  1900's.  This scene was of Mr. Ullman visiting Wendy and Danny in the  hospital, telling them how sorry he was about what happened.  I believe  this was the only scene cut from the original film distributed by Kubrick  (re-cut within the first week of release).

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1K6K23WG0IBWE	Quadro Sinead Summer	With out a doubt Stephen King's book get's the royal treatment in this superb Stanley Kubrick film, and The shining turns out to be the best film ever made from a Stephen King novel. Stanley Kubrick was for certain more than your average director. His films are often undeniable masterpieces. But even more so, I don't think anyone knew just how truly dangerous it was to put Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson in the same room together. It certainly seemed like an odd pairing, but it worked very well. Stanley Kubrick allowed Nicholson to ham it up with all he had to muster and for that we as the audience are forever thankful. Nicholson's Jack Torrance is one of the greatest performances ever put on film. In fact every actor in this movie was cast so perfectly the movie just overflows with some of the best performances and memorable characters one could ever hope for. Shelly Duval turns in the best performance of her career as do numerous other actors, especially Scattman Crothers who is simply brilliant. Kubrick fills the movie with so much atmosphere that the audience can feel it all. You feel the sense of isolation. You feel the dream-like and creepy mood of the movie. And the creation of the Overlook hotel was a masterful achievement. One of the best performers in this movie is the hotel it's self. Of course Nicholson and King fans are the ones that wanted to see this movie the most when it was first released, and what they got is a dream come true for any fan of either of the two. There has never been a horror film like The Shining and there never will be again. It is a powerful, operatic masterpiece. It was also a very nice surprise to see the superb actor, Philip Stone who played Alex's Dad in a Clockwork Orange in this film as well in the small but memorable role of Delbert Grady. From beginning to end The Shining is by far one of the three best Horror movies ever made. It is not to be missed.	5.0	Stanley Kubrick, the greatest director that ever lived!

Maybe we've just gotten used to faster-paced, ""jump scare"" horror movies, but everything in The Shining seems to be moving through thickly congealed Jell-O. Just when it starts to pick up, you're cut away to some boring scene, like having to watch the cook go through all the steps of being on the plane, chatting with his friend, renting a snow cat, etc. Maybe it was supposed to build suspense, but by the end of the movie, two out of four of our party watching were sound asleep. The little boy screeching ""red rum"" made us burst out laughing. If it wasn't for the constantly intruding, over-the-top soundtrack, you wouldn't even know how to feel about what's going on. Fortunately, we have a strident orchestra to tell us to ""Be scared here!"" or ""This is supposed to be odd!""

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AKHVOV62ANADS	"Raif Hollister ""slugnut"""	"Amazing to think that Stephen King did not like this adaptation. Apparently he believed that Kubrick did not appreciate or emphasize the evilness inherent in the Overlook Hotel, which he believed should have been the star of the show. But King has always been preoccupied with trying (often vainly) to make inanimate objects seem evil and scary, from cars to trucks to killer topiary. More often than not, it's juvenile stuff. After all, a car is just a car, but people are scary as hell.Kubrick, on the other hand, was wise to focus on the characters who inhabit and haunt the Overlook Hotel, both past and present. Their evilness in thoughts and deeds is manifested brilliantly in Nicholson's performance. He manages to be manical without going over the top, without wrecking the suspension of disbelief. He's a guy hanging onto sanity by his fingernails and the guests at the Overlook have given him that last final nudge.The characters themselves, like many from the pen of King, are flat and cartoonish and yet Kubrick doesn't fight it. From Nicholson's descent into madness, Duvall's whimpering terror, and little Danny's creepiness, the characters are all they need to be, multiplied by ten.The strange Arbus-like visuals, the coldness and isolation of the hotel, and the mystery that pervades the movie are all brilliantly done. There is no ""cut and dried"" plot resolution, something that is both unsettling and refreshing in the dumb-downed world of Hollywood movies. The movie gets under your skin and stays there, like a bad nightmare. And it does so without brutalizing the audience like so many modern horror movies (e.g. ""Hannibal,"" etc.).Kubrick diffuses and lightens King's manipulative scenarios and the movie is more powerful for it. Unfortunately, subtlety and understatement are in short supply these days in all forms of media. Writers and directors think if they are not in your face, screaming in Dolby stereo that no one is listening. A shame.""The Shining"" is easily one of the best horror movies ever made. Given King's disappointment with it, the credit has to go mostly to Kubrick.Highly recommended."	5.0	Brilliant, disturbing, unforgettable	2002-09-27	9	7	2

Since the movie, Room 237, was released recently, there has been a little more ""buzz"" about this film.  I decided to read the book, then watch the movie.  The movie was a big disappointment for me.  I realize that movie effects have come a long way from what was available in 1980, but in the book, the hotel itself seemed ""alive"" and almost like another character.  In the movie, the hotel was just haunted by some weird characters and you weren't sure if they meant any harm or if they were just incidental.  The movie didn't explore the history of the hotel and didn't even really hint about the tragedies that happened long before the Torrances arrived.  It would have been scarier/darker if there had been more foreshadowing of the paranormal events.There was also no explanation of why the Torrances didn't just leave.  In the book, you had a good idea that this was Jack's last chance at keeping a steady income while working on his play.  He really needed the job to provide for his family after being fired from teaching.  There was so much that could have been covered using flashbacks, but it was ignored entirely to the detriment of the story, in my opinion.I think Jack Nicholson was a great choice for the lead character.  He portrayed a seemingly stable person who could snap at any given moment.  Shelly Duvall was OK, but more importantly, I don't think she was given a role that worked well in the movie.  The little boy was pretty amazing, but I thought the idea of him talking to his index finger in a deep voice was laughable.  In the book, his pretend friend, Tony, was a shadowy figure, only visible to Danny, and gave him information.  Tony could have been portrayed as a shadow (as opposed to Danny's index finger...), that leaves the room when someone else besides Danny comes in.  It could be a shadow that you may see out of the corner of your eye, not knowing whether your eye is playing tricks or not.  Though Tony was not, ultimately, a scary figure in the book, you weren't sure if you should trust him.  The appearance of Tony was always a little uncomfortable.I think this movie could be re-made by someone with a deeper understanding of the book and characters.  I never felt an attachment to the characters in the movie.  Special effects have also come a long way..."	2.0	Read the book...	2013-06-29	3	2	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AZAEN52HOZA7T	"Reka Kovacs ""Madonna"""	"As far as most horror movies go not too many scare  me but this one sure did.  The Shining is directed by Stanley Kubrick based the the Stephen King Novel.This is by far one of the scaries movies I have seen.The movie starts off with beautiful mountain scenery and a car driving towards a location, which we soon found out it is the Overlook Hotel ( The outside shot of the hotel is actually a hotel in Oregon called The Timberline Lodge). The music is scary and it has an inpending doom sound to it.  Jack is there to be  interviewed for a winter caretaker position. He gets the job.  Even after telling him about the tragedy that took place here with the previous caretaker, he still takes the job.Then we go to a scene at a motel with Shelley Duvall and Danny in Colorado.  Danny has the special ability to shine and his imaginary freind Tony shows him things he does not want to see. When he sees them  he blacks out. Danny can some how see the future and the past which are shown to him by Tony. These scenes are interesting because they actually happened or will happen. This is a great start as to what ""The Shining"" actually means.Nicolson is already not normal looking so he was perfectly cast for the role.  I dont know why King did not want him. As they enter the hotel and beginn their 5 month isolation from the world strange and bizzare things slowly start to happen. Danny first sees 2 twin girls while playing darts.  They are so freeky and just thinking about then scares me. The girls were the former caretaker Grady daughters. Jack starts to eagerly work on his new book  but is interrupted by Wendy which I think slowly starts his way into going mad or slowly towards a complete breakdown. The hotel seems to be taking over Jack and his own personal demons that he has dealth with and starts to bring them back.  He starts to hallucinate and walks into a bar with a bartender there that offers him a drink. Jack after hitting his son way back when he was a school teacher said he would never drink again yet he does.Then there is little Danny riding around the hotel in his buggy. The music again is spine tingling. Everytime he turns a corner you get scared because you dont know whats ahead. The scariest part is when he turns yet another corner and encounters the 2 twins. This is the scariest scene in the whole movie!! Danny of course freeks out. Danny knows there is something special about room 237 after he rides by it and tries to open it. But the next time  around in his litle buggy it is open. Again the hotel ghosts doing all this, he enters then we lead up to the next scene. Something happens in that room but we do not know what. Interesting to leave to the imagination.Jack starts to lose it more as he has dreams of him killing Danny and Wendy, the hotel probably taking over his mind and telling him  what to do, which of course leads Jack back to the  bar again expecially after Wendy accuses him of abusing Danny after Danny walks out to them. Even though somebody in that room caused Danny's bruises.  The hotel brings back Jacks past when he hit Danny and presents it to Wendy now.Now that the hotel or ghosts have made Jack hated by Wendy as to what he supposedly did, he investigates a room where Wendy says someone  tried to strangle Danny completly forgetting about Jack hitting Danny. He of course gets more upset because he thinks he is not doing his job right with someone else in the hotel. Another example of the hotel ""telling"" him he is not doing his job.  Wendy  starts to go a little nuts too. He walks in to the room Wendy told him too and you see a nude woman slowly pullimg out the curtains and walking to him. Now the hotel is testing is loyalty to Wendy. He gives in of course. The scene with the woman is the next scariest scene. The women strats mocking him because ""the hotel"" is making fun of him and how he still cant cope with things.The hallucinations continue to get more bizzare where he is in a ball room sorrounded  by many people celebrating the 4th Of July. He then bumps into Grady in the bathroom. Grady tells him he needs to correct his family just as he did. He says that Danny and Wendy are preventing him from fullfilling his duties and Danny has a special force and is bringing in help. There is some reincarnation in this movie that I quite dont understand. Grady in the 1920's with a different first name and  Grady in 1970 with a different first name just dont get it. Maybe their souls  were reborn or reincarnated. Jack obviously loses it when he types ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull Boy"" written in his book over and over again. Wendy sees this as she flips through the pages and is convinced her husband has gone mad. Wendy picks up a bat and hits jack and puts him in the freezer room. Grady mocks him again saying that Wendy is stronger than they had thought. Finally Jacks agrees to ""correct the problem"". Danny starts to write redrum backwards on the door with his mothers lipstick. ""Tony"" is within him and his says Redrum in his errie voice over and over again.  His ""special abilities"" tell him again of whats going to happen.  As soon as Wendy wakes up we hear Jack with his big ax trying to get through the door. Little Danny is chased in the big snowy maze by Jack.  The photography in this movie is great some scenes were shot at  different angles. I give this movie 10 stars it makes you think and gets me scared every time I watch it. It is definately a horror masterpiece in my opionion."	5.0	"Stanley Kubrick Horror Masterpiece ""Heres Johnny"""	2005-06-11	5	2	3

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3W13VVBRY5GL7	"Review Lover ""ReviewLover"""	The box-blurb for this digitally renewed version of Kubrick's 1980 Masterpiece claims that this is the &quot;first epic horror film&quot;, at least according to Newsweek's Jack Kroll.Now, not to be disrespectful to Mr. Kroll, nor indeed to belittle the movie itself (over which I am about to wax lyrical), but he seems to have forgotten William Friedkin's seminal meisterwork &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, released some seven years previous, and before that, Bela Lugosi's throbbing, heaving, sexual, meaty 1931 performance as Dracula, in the movie of the same name.But if that was the first epic horror movie, and &quot;Exorcist&quot; the second, then Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; comes a very, VERY close third, and in many ways, beats those other masterpiece works of cinema at their own game.First of all, &quot;The Shining&quot; is based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, but is not altogether similar to the book, so to satisfy the book-lovers amongst us (myself included, a teriffic read and one of King's unequivocal best) I'll just say this: the film version of &quot;The Shining&quot; is one of those joyfully rare things where the novel loses nothing in the translation. In fact, thanks to the Screenplay's omission of several key-to-the-Novel vignettes (hedge animals, boiler, Jack's alcoholism) the movie production is able to concentrate on an altogether more frightening angle: without any apparent character deficiency or flaw, Jack Torrance is subverted anyway, to the same grisly ends, by the malevolent Hotel. It makes for a compelling comparison - in the book, Jack's troubled psyche is present ever before he sets foot in the Overlook, but here in the movie, the power of the Hotel is such that it can take a normal, angry man and turn him to... ...things. Unencumbered by such character exploration and explanation, (which works exquisitely well in the novel, a counterpoint, if you will, to the madness of Overlook Jack), Kubrick (Rest In Peace, you deserve it!) is able to weave a magnificent and nightmarish story out of the simplest, most mundane of threads, and creates in the movie a Monster which is all the more terrifying because of his apparent normalcy.Now, to synopsise the plot: Jack and Wendy Torrance, and their psychic son Danny, move to the Overlook Hotel in Colorado for the winter. Jack's the new winter caretaker and, looking forward to having lots of quiet time and isolation to get on with his new Novel, he begins to go slowly insane, while Danny begins to notice more and more the creeping evil contained within the Overlook. To say more is to spoil it, but trust me, it's worth every damn second of screen time.Performance-wise, we have Jack Nicholson playing Jack Nicholson, but here it works oh-so-perfectly-well. The indefinable sense of rage and malevolence he radiates during the scenes where he is watching Wendy and Danny through the lobby windows, and the yowling Baby Jane-esque mania of the movie's final reel bear all the hallmarks of truly great acting. We believe that this is Jack Torrance, we believe that he is evil, and we believe that he is subjected to all manner of psycho-supernatural abuse by the malevolent hotel. He is, in short, perfectly cast in his role, and gives one of his finest performances in &quot;The Shining&quot;. In her role as Wendy, Shelley Duvall is a light, a wonderful actress portraying with scalpel precision the frailty and ignorant fear of a woman caught in the middle. Her portrayal of Wendy is as accomplished as it is endearing, and of the three main leads in the picture, hers is the most developed character - the contrast between placid, sweet Wendy at the start of the movie and the unhinged, terrified end-Wendy is brought about by Duvall's exquisite ability to showcase a broad range of believable emotion in a relatively short amount of screen time. Danny Lloyd as Danny Torrance is excellent, the much-parlayed 'Redrum' scene is a gem, and he is perfectly believable as the psychic Kid with the weight of the World (or at least, the weight of the Overlook) on his small shoulders.The Direction is what sets &quot;The Shining&quot; apart, but with a genius like Kubrick at the helm, what can we expect? It's like music; the staccatto, stark interior shots of the monochromatic lobby interior and sterile kitchen make for the most terrifying visual contrast with the dream-like, expansive opening sequence, and the snowy, winter-wonderland exterior scenes provide the absolute sense of isolation that the Torrence family must indeed be feeling.Musically, I don't believe I have ever seen a film scored more perfectly. Shades of Max Steiner (Mildred Pierce and Now, Voyager) abound as the jangling violins and human-like guttural bellows create an ideal and perfect aural accompaniment to the already ideal visual.I can't rave enough about this masterful, terrifying and altogether absorbing piece of work. It must be owned and watched, and that is all.Simple, isn't it :-) ?	5.0	Outstanding, even after 24 years.	2004-07-20	5	3	2

This adaptation was definitely not. Kubrick was thought to be a genious... The Overlook Hotel somewhere in the hills of Colorado - what better place for Nickolson to strut his absolute  best work. Shelley Duvall was an excellent choice to play the scatterbrain  wife with the wide popping eyes at all the right times. The flashbacks and  things little Danny sees really set the stage and without being graphic or  gross - totally horrifies you. A few memorable scenes... 1. The Interview,  2. Nicholson is interrupted by Duvall while typing, 3. Nicholson chasing  Duvall up the stairs and cornering her in the bathroom, and 4. the chase in  the snowy cold garden labyrinth.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1AIJX4W864HIY	"""rhettbutler2"""	I have to admit, The Shining is one of the scariest stories that has ever been made into a movie.  But, I could never help feeling that it could have been even better.  Let's face it, the acting is NOT very good.  The lines seem forced and unnatural.  Shelly Duvall's character is horrible, she seemed like she read her lines off of a card.  As for Danny, all I could think is why didn't they get this kid's hair cut?  Also, it doesn't necessarily do the book justice, lacking in character development and the true gradually decline of Nicholson's character.  I don't buy into the criticism that Kubrick's version is less appealing because it doesn't closely follow the book.  I think some of Kubrick's changes made the story even creapier.  However, when King had his hands more firmly in control of the 1997 television remake, the true horror that could have been was finally glimpsed.  Granted, its 4.5 hours long and that allows for a little more, but the character development is extraordinary.  With the original it seemed that Jack woke up one day and was crazy.  In the remake, its possible to see the subtle levels of his insanity as it happens.  And this was made for TV!  If this would have been made for theaters and not subject to TV's guidelines, this would have been the horror movie for the ages.  Unfortunately, the miniseries has to date not been released on video.  But if you ever get the chance to see it, then you will put your Kubrick version firmly on the shelf, where it will accumulate more dust than Calista Flockhart's oven.  For the original - 3 stars, still very scary and has great atmosphere.

The beginning sets the stage and slowly takes us into the lonely  hotel with just the three human occupants. It is there we start shivering  as Jack starts breaking down and the hotel ghosts start making their  appearances. I particularly enjoyed Lloyd the bartender and Grady the  caretaker. Their impeccable grooming and polite manners disguise their  fiendish intent. We get a brief feeling of relief when Scatman Crothers is  called in, but that is cancelled when he meets his untimely end. Shelley  Duvall was a perfect choice for Jack's wife.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3S175V6UMWDSU	Robert	"May 23rd 1980: Opening on Memorial Day weekend - a mere two days after The Empire Strikes Back - The Shining hit theaters, ultimately earning $44,017,374 at the domestic box office. The Stephen King novel, in which the film was based, also spawned a miniseries in 1997 by director Mick Garris.Review: The Shining would mark the third Stephen King adaptation. The first was the theatrically released classic from Brian De Palma, Carrie, and the second being the Tobe Hooper miniseries, Salem's Lot. It would be the difficult task for Stanley Kubrick, one of cinema's greatest filmmakers, to co-adapt [with novelist Diane Johnson] and helm the bestselling novel.For a brief refresher: the film centers on recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance, who is a writer that accepts the job as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, and moves in with his wife and his son in the process. Soon, as the family gets snowed in at the isolated hotel, Jack begins to slowly slip into madness.Technically, this film is a masterpiece; special kudos to the setting, the musical score and the cinematography, in particular. The production design of the Overlook is ominously spacious which helps capture the desired vibe which is only enhanced by the hair-raising musical score. Kubrick's meticulousness coupled with the incredible cinematography - the tracking shots are impeccably handled - the film attacks the viewer with both sight and sound. There is so much of this movie that will truly stay with you long after it is over. The images of the identical twins, the wave of blood crashing out of the elevator, or The Overlook Maze have caused many of sleepless nights. So has Jack Nicholson's Oscar-worthy performance of Jack Torrance. His dialogue - such as the ad-libbed ""Here's Johnny!"" - is littered with some of filmdom's most devilishly quotable lines. Even now, 30 years later, few horror films have ever come close to rivaling The Shining. It holds up as one of the genre's most creepiest and unsettling films.From the perspective of an outside spectator, however, The Shining may not have seemed destined for greatness. Principal photography for the film, which lasted for over a year, as Kubrick was consistently changing the script and shooting scenes that would exceed as many as a hundred takes was anything but ideal -- though Kubrick was never known to be one that rushes. The grueling production schedule - which was predominately shot on soundstages with some of the largest sets ever constructed - was brilliantly chronicled in the widely available documentary, The Making of the Shining, by Kubrick's daughter, Vivian. Like the film it covers, it is a must see.The Shining's initial critical response, however, was mixed, as even Stephen King was unhappy by most of Kubrick's decisions, which included, but not limited to, the various changes from the book and the casting of Jack Nicholson. Ultimately, the author would be proven wrong, as Kubrick's take on The Shining is widely considered to be one of the genre's best as it has been celebrated numerous times by the American Film Institute, as well as today's most respected critics and filmmakers alike.The Shining (Two-Disc Special Edition) or the single disc Blu-ray both feature an informative commentary track by Steadicam Inventor/Operator Garrett Brown and Historian John Baxter. Beyond the aforementioned The Making of the Shining (which includes an optional commentary), there are three new featurettes (View from the Overlook: Crafting the Shining, The Visions of Stanley Kubrick, and Wendy Carlos, Composer). As to be expected, the set includes the film's theatrical trailer, as well. It's a wonderful release that has never made the film look or sound better. Do yourself a favor, and pick this bad boy up."	5.0	Kubrick Masters King	2011-10-01	4	4	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3R9L84MBK09NQ	Robert J. Brady	The Shining is a movie you can watch on a hot August day and still get chills. It's not just the wintery backdrop, the eeire deserted montain hotel, a family trapped by snow, cabin fever and supernatural homicidal evil, one is pulled along like a helpless spectator. The music is unremitting as the tension builds. The Nicholson charactor descends into madness and total possession, his facial expressions contorted by insanity and the spell of the hotel's ghosts exhorting him to murder. The saucer eyed Duvall is visceral and waiflike in terror.  We are essentially the kid, psychic, helpless and seeing it all going down. This is a movie to see over and over to appreciate all the talent that went into this teeth chattering classic.	5.0	Great Summer Movie	2005-10-20	4	2	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	This is the introspective version of the story, unlike the later version that King preferred.  It is the story of a family down on its luck, so the father takes a job as caretaker of a remote hotel that is supposed to be on some kind of ancient Indian burial ground.  Strange murderous things happened there before, but no one knows exactly what.  The mother and boy feel the tension vis-a-vis the father, who is a recovering alcoholic boiling with the most terrible anger.  He clearly loves the boy, but the mother blames him for a violent action he had made when drunk.  This is all understated, in the background but every detail of what unfolds fits in with this psychology.  It is a masterpiece like cut crystal.Jack Nicholson is at the height of his powers here, young and still with a spirit to experiment with his roles rather than walking through the blatant commercial ones of his later career (however well he did them).  He is a troubled father and stalled writer, on his last legs in many ways.  You feel this just by looking at him, every gesture of the character consistent with his mental state.  He looks frightening, but there is love in him, too, as the thing begins to struggle for his mind.  Shelly Duvall, his wife, is is absolutely amazing, as she watches, the terror mounting inside of her until she can barely speak.  Finally, the boy - with supernatural powers of extrasensory communication -  calls for help.  The boy and his mother know something is coming, as the visions mount and strange occurrences begin.Nicholson is haunted by visions and begins to drink.  But it is clear that he has been under pressure the entire time they have been isoated there.  When Duvall discovers that something is wrong, it is one of the most terrifying moments in cinema that I have ever seen, but what does it is her acting, her demeanor of hysteria and despair.  I totally believed her.There are also many mysteries in the film, strange clues that remain unexplained.  My favorite is the appearance of Nicholson in an old photograph, leaving it to the viewer to interpret.  It is a one wonderful detail among many that enter the careful viewers' imagination to fit in with all the other parts of the film.  It is brilliant and perfect, just like the way that the boy escapes.Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  One of the best I have ever seen.	5.0	absolutely perfect horror that comes from the inside	2010-11-15	1	1	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AW3FTPCBPVQNB	Robert J. Schneider	Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING (1980) is a cinematic marvel. Visually stunning, emotionally disturbing, it throws everything at you but the kitchen sink---and purposely attempts to explain almost nothing. Kubrick directed this filmic adaptation of the Stephen King bestseller with his finetoothed artistic brush; his genius as a director always coming from his genius as a photographer. However, this didn't stop his film from raising a firestorm of controversy ever since Kubrick began principal photography in 1979. Starting with the author himself, Stephen King was most displeased over the immense amount of changes Kubrick made to his story. When the movie was finally finished and released in 1980, it received cheers & jeers in roughly equal amounts, from critics to Stephen King fans.I can see both sides to the controversy. What Stanley Kubrick made was a film *based on* the book of the same name, not a film version of the book itself. Although I believe that most people wrongfully assume that a film treatment of a book *has to* be faithful to it, I will agree that Kubrick changed more than what is normal for a book-to-screen adaptation. In doing so, he crafted a movie that was radically different from the novel. On the other hand, many of Kubrick's changes were for the better, the most notable of them being the hedge maze replacing the hedge animals from the book. Besides the fact that the latter would have been really hard to film back in 1979-80, the former added a new dimension of space, shape and horror to the proceedings. It was made effectively creepy and, of course, with the way Kubrick photographs, gave us a real sense of the vulnerability of the Torrance family, being all alone in the middle of a snow-covered nowhere.Then there is the acting---brilliant, just brilliant. Jack Nicholson, who had already established himself as one of the most important actors of our time with his very well-deserved 1975 Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of faux-mentally disturbed Randall P. McMurphy in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, here as Jack Torrance created an equally memorable character that has also been enshrined in movie immortality. Shelley Duvall brings an intensity to Wendy Torrance that was perhaps under-emphasized in the book. Six-year-old Danny Lloyd, in his debut to his very brief film career (he would only do one other film after this one), is compulsively watchable as five-year-old Danny Torrance and completely commands our attention every time he's onscreen. Finally, 70-year-old Scatman Crothers as head cook Dick Hallorann, who shares the terrible gift of clairvoyance with Danny, gives what is probably the most memorable performance in his long and distinguished career.Yes, there are flaws, most notably the fact that Jack Torrance is made to go off the wall too soon into the film. In the book, it was a gradual incorporation of the hotel's evil spirit; perhaps too slow, but in the movie it happens so fast that we don't get any time to actually *sympathise* with his plight. But the film works on so many visual levels that it can be forgiven for its lack of character development. Be forewarned about showing this to your kids: THE SHINING is a rare phenomenon in that it's much bloodier and gorier than the book; usually it's the other way around with Stephen King books. THE SHINING may not be perfect, but it is nevertheless a Horror classic, a Stanley Kubrick classic and a Jack Nicholson classic---and it leaves us with a final shot that is as haunting as it is thought-provoking.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED; AGES 15 & UP	5.0	One Of The Greatest Horror Films, As Well As Controversial	2004-06-17	11	7	4

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1FIHRQ0SV6O2V	Robert Scot Stackley	"First, I consider ""Shining"" to be the greatest novel ever written, so take my opinion with that in mind.I remember well standing in line for two hours outside of Oakbrook Commons theatre, almost trembling with excitement to see this film.  It was the most anticipated ""event"" in years for my circle of friends.The lights went down...and we watched ""King Lear Meets Jack Torrance"".  The ENTIRE CONCEPT of the book centres around the premise that the evil of the hotel slowly peels away the layers of Jack's sanity.  In this tripe, Jack is bat-shoot crazy from the first frame on!Oh, and all those ""hip"" and ""edgy"" shots of blood flowing from the elevator and dead twins and a boy talking to his finger like Reagan O'Neil and some weird landscaping maze and Jack breaking through a door and yelling ""Here's Johnny!""...none of those elements were in the novel...know why?  'Cuz they have NOTHING to DO with the STORY!  Know what WAS in the novel?  Topiary that came to life and tried to kill people.  A possibly real, yet benign spirit who manifested to Danny at the moments when he was needed the most. A competent, wary and spry Dick Halloran who LIVES.  A strong, determined, mama-grizzly Wendy who loved her son and would never be found whimpering and cowering in hallways.  Overall, I'd say, you found very faulty, yet very human, and very likeable characters.What do I remember most about that night in Oakbrook?  An audience walking out in total silence, absolutely appalled by what they had just seen.  This silent crowd slowly blending into a blurred mass as tears formed in my eyes.  I'm serious, ""Shining"" is my favourite novel ever, and this abomination actually moved me to tears of grief.Everyone faces their own demons in their own way.  That's the lifeblood of the ""Shining"" novel.  This waste of film is about a self-absorbed director spending two and a half hours showing us all how ""cool"" and ""trendy"" he is.  I can't come down on all the Kubrickites who think he can do no wrong...I went through the same thing with David Byrne in the 80's, although 20 years later, I watched ""True Stories"" again and I was all, ""What was I thinking?""OK, so why did I write this, like, 33 years after the fact?  Well, ""Doctor Sleep"", sequel to ""Shining"", has just been released in hardcover.  I'm sure it will make it to film one day.  Also, Halloween is coming up in a couple of weeks.  So my sincere wish is that if either of these two events have moved you to consider buying ""Shining"", I'm hoping this review will save you from making a horribly regrettable mistake.  Please, for your own sake, don't ever watch this.  It's absolutely worthless."	1.0	Worthless Excremental Garbage	2013-10-01	18	3	15
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1GZ49W13STTFG	"Robert S. Gartner ""I am the Grungeman"""	`The Shining' is a ghost story about an unemployed, recovering alcoholic teacher trying to make it as a writer. The only job that he can find is as a caretaker for the Overlook Hotel in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, which shuts down every winter only to reopen in the spring. Despite stories of previous murders at the hotel, Jack Torrance moves there with his wife, Wendy, and young son, Danny, who is telepathic (Dick Halloran, the head cook, tells Danny, he has the shining.) The hotel is possessed by some of life force and the ghost's of previous visitors who died violently. Danny feels and sees these ghosts, but he keeps it to himself and resists them. Whatever this force is, it slowly begins to take over Jack Torrance and he begins to terrorize his family just like the previous caretaker.I am a big fan of Stephen King's novels and `The Shining' was one of the best. This movie, however, does not do the book justice. With the exception of the great Scatman Crothers, everyone is terribly miscast in this film. Shelley Duvall is unbelievable and mousy in her roll as Jack Nicholson's wife. Jack Nicholson is hopelessly miscast as Jack Torrance. When I originally saw this film in the theatre, the audience howled in laughter at Mr. Nicholson in the scene where he interviews for the job. He looked crazier then rather than later on in the film, when he chases Shelley Duvall around with an axe (at which point the audience cheered him on.) Stanley Kubrick stated that he did not like ghost stories, he did not believe in ghosts and he was not going to make this movie as a ghost story. It shows. I must be the only person on the planet who believes Mr. Kubrick to be the most overrated, untalented director ever.The only reason that this film gets two stars is because it is, if nothing else, a visually stunning film and the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful with music from Wendy Carlos, Bela Bartok and Gyorgi Ligeti. Compare this film with the three part television version by Director Mick Garris (starring Rebecca DeMornay and Steven Weber) and you will see that the latter is much better.	2.0	Should have been called 'The Tarnished'	2006-06-13	27	9	18

This was one of the first to use the Panaglide (or Stedicam) system. The camera just smoothly glides through all of it's movements as in following the boy on his tricycle as he rides through the hotel hallways. The camera is at ground level! Also used for the chase at the end through the snow covered maze. Actually, it's used throughout the film. This is one of Stanley Kubrick's best films in my estimation. His last film (Eyes Wide Shut) is a really good film although it's content is certainly for adults only.	5.0	A Perfect Quality Transfer!	2013-11-21	0	0	0

Kubrick only ""preferred"" full-screen video releases of his films because the only other option in the 80's was to crop the sides of the picture off. There was no such thing as anamorphic widescreen dvds or widescreen tvs when this was his ""preference"". Instead they removed the matting on the tops and bottom to make the image square (more or less) for tv. This sometimes revealed things not meant to be seen (helicopter shadows in the opening etc.)If you've ever seen Pee-Wee's Big Adventure in full screen you know what I mean. In that you could see dolly tracks, the never ending bike chain coming up under his bike etc.The original aspect ratio was WIDESCREEN. That's the image we were meant to see.

But I'm sick of the new features that the studios feel they HAVE to include to justify the UPGRADE. In the case of classic movies, the improved video and audio is just enough. If they incluye a new documentary or long lost interviews is ok, but as the disc extras, not, please, as part of the feature film. Or al least, please put the option to play the movie without these escenes.They include here i think at least 2 new disc chapters. These extra footage is not in the DVD or the theatrical version of the film. In result, the film lost of its timing and rythm. It's now a little slow paced and has lost some of the mistery of the plot, because of this extra information depicted.Even Kubrick after the premiere of the film decided to remove all this footage to make to improve the picture.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	ADKA2MJQQCMTO	Ron Sullivan	This is going to be a fairly short review.  I'm not going to delve into summarizing the story or critiquing Kubrick's direction.  Frankly, this film has been so heralded and around so long that if you need to be recapped you haven't been paying enough attention.  Long story short, this is one of (if not THE) best haunted house film ever, made by one of the most influential directors in history.Which leads to the question of why I'm giving it a four star rating instead of five?  I'm knocking it a star for the DVD not just EXPLODING with extras.  It's, basically, packed with nothing.  A short half-hour documentary, a commentary by Kubrick's daughter, and a trailer just isn't enough to do this justice.  Where's the commentary by Nicholson or King (who famously didn't enjoy this version)?  Where's the retrospective on how this film impacted the industry?  Where's the reflection by the cast on their experiences on the set?This is a film that should have been an education to dive into and an opportunity to pay homage to a brilliant film-maker.  Warner Bros, however, seem to have decided this wasn't important to us.	4.0	"""Where's the Beef?"""	2005-12-07	5	3	2

I was really interested to see the deleated scenes but they only serve to slow down the pace of the film and actually reduce the slow build of tension.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2KOLNJDBYJRNL	R. Overton	I have little to add to the many wonderfully informed reviews of this movie. The arguing about aspect ratio seems like pedantic, technical showing off--look, you're watching it at home so there are a lot of things that differ from the theatrical screening--crucially, the loss of sharing a communal dream (nightmare?) when seeing it with an audience of strangers. It's true that Kubrick, the prodigy photographer, is always using color & composition to establish mood & meaning. But very little of that is lost at the edges, especially in the Blu-ray version (which is almost too sharply defined for my taste; some of the effects look like computer graphics, which they--considering the year of release--of course are not). Interestingly, the movie has gained in reputation among cinephiles since its release, very much in the way BARRY LYNDON has. The basic disagreement here is the ongoing basic disagreement about Kubrick. For those who find him cold & cerebral, this will support those views. He's not warm & fuzzy--especially in THE SHINING. It's a cold movie, full of cold, empty rooms & corridors. And there are those, like Pauline Kael, who will never forgive Kubrick for moving to England. But THE SHINING is a classic--despite my Jack Nicholson problem. (One reviewer--TIME OUT, I think--has a point; Nicholson switches into Looney Tunes manic mode a little too quickly.) Don't watch this if you don't like Kubrick's stylized way of working. And don't watch it if you expect a true horror movie, based on the novel. Or if you have a phobia for frozen mazes.For the rest of us, it's terrific!	5.0	Well, time has sorted things out	2013-04-26	1	1	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A264UCDZZ6RLDN	Russell de Ville	I saw 'The Shining' for the very first time whilst recently at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado. Apparently, one of the in-house channels runs the feature 24-7. Though it is common knowledge Stephen King was inspired and developed some of his thoughts preliminary to writing the novel, the subsequent adaptation itself was filmed elsewhere, principally in Oregon and England.I consider this movie as more of a psychological thriller than a true horror film. Though there are some genuinely chilling sequences, 'The Shining' is a dated, often confusing series of disjointed vignettes and freeze frames. It is poorly written, engages its actors in embarrassingly ill-considered stagecraft and has been badly transferred to a grainy full-screen DVD format with wretched sound. I think even Mr Kubrick would be embarrassed.It's probably not fair to judge thus harshly after so much time has passed. After all, we do get front-on nudity and the `f' word a lot. There are several other uncomfortable--often inexplicable--moments as well. I'll never envision Yogi Bear the same, I assure you. These things had a certain shock value for their time; still, I'm disappointed. Classic as it may be, it's a poorly made, outdated bit of psychodrivel.I'll eventually go back and see it again. I am curious as to what I may have missed the first time out. And too, I'm open to editing and revising my remarks accordingly.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A12AHC2OCCG7IW	Ryan	The Shining [Blu-ray] (2007) looks really good. The picture is the clearest I've seen of the movie and there's a lot of details to be seen throughout. The objects and details in the background of the hotel are distinct and clearly seen. You can clearly see the details on the actors' faces, such as pores. I was especially impressed by the wider inside camera shots of the hotel... it's almost hard to believe how clear those particular shots are.This is the best version of The Shining currently on the market. It's a disc you'll want to own, especially if you're a fan of the movie. Hopefully, there will be a new 4K Master/8K Master Blu-ray of the movie someday, but until that time comes, this disc is as good as you can get of The Shining.	4.0	The Shining [Blu-ray] (2007) looks really good.	2013-11-30	0	0	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AIYACFQQGKMGD	Sam	Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel &quot;The Shining&quot; has become an extremely important part of popular film culture, with many scenes and lines from the movie appearing in all forms  of media. However, as an avid reader, I felt this movie was a complete  failure as a book adaptation. This movie, in itself, could be seen as a  great movie if one has not read King's masterpiece. But after reading the  book, one can plainly see how horrible Kubrick's movie truly is. First, the  character portrayals were complelty different from the book. Nicholson's  Jack Torrance was essentially a mad man from the start, and fails to show  the fall from grace that Jack Torrance had in the novel. Shelly Duvall was  complelty horrible as Wendy Torrance, portraying a week willed woman  completly different than that of the novel. The movie's plot totally  altered King's plot, adding things and changing many existsing things,  especially the ending, which was far superior in the book. Many critics may  say that movies are not supposed to be exact reworks of the book, but  essentially Kubrick's version is almost a different story with the same  name. The cinematic techniques of Kubrick's movie were excellent, but after  reading the book, one can see how lackluster this film truly is.	1.0	Nowhere Near as Good as the Book!	2000-05-21	43	21	22
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AH3ZQ8AVKKYI5	Sammy Madison	I was amazed to hear that Stephen King did not think this movie does justice to his book.  Even more amazing was how very bad the remake, which King liked, was.  I think King must have been feeling sour grapes, because I found this movie WAY better than the book.  Any woman who has been abused will recognize Jack Nicholson's smirk, his swagger, and his sarcasm.  When he strutted though the hotel's kitchen, smiling as he knocked metal pans around, proud as punch of his machismo, I just cringed.  And Shelly Duvall was perfect as the abused wife.  Her weakness and ineffectiveness was interspersed with desperate courage in just the right places.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3T4NU2IDH99XJ	Samuel J Robertson	The main reason I'm writing this &quot;review&quot; is to make sure people know that &quot;The Shining&quot; was originally and still is a 'full screen' flick. It always was intended to be displayed as a 4:3 image. I love widescreen movies, but this one isn't!Anyway, the movie's great. I haven't read the book so I won't try to compare the two. I loved the cinematography. And the music is pretty engaging as well. And for those of you out there who don't really like horrors because they tend to be gore fests you need not worry about this film. It does contain some interesting (maybe disturbing is a better word) scenes, but mainly the movie is just beautifully creepy.	4.0	Full screen?

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2G5SNWDL61VJ7	"Sam Whittaker ""Sam"""	"As the author ofA Ghost of Fire (Ghostly Elements)I love a good ghost story. ""The Shining"" film does more than is necessary to fit the bill and has become something of an American cultural icon when it comes to horror. It's filled with great, scary, and horrifying moments. There's good tension and a steadily unveiling mystery, which I think are absolutely key elements to any Ghost Story worth it's weight in gold. If you're a horror movie aficionado, this is as good as place as any to start.Now to my niggling issues with the film. While I still really enjoy it, it does pose a few problems. If you're familiar with the original source material there are some issues with Jack and Wendy. Danny is pretty good, but Wendy is a little too meek in this film, and Jack seems to have a simmering craziness almost from the get-go, which is untrue of the character in the book. That, I think, is in Part Jack Nicholson's doing. As an actor he seems to know where the character is headed (fine), but he takes us there far too early. Jack isn't nursing a middle-grade anger throughout the book like he does in the movie.The film ends differently than book does too, which is a bit of a bother, but I actually enjoy the film's ending, so it's not so bad.In some regards, I actually like the 1997 made for TV mini-series better than this version. It's much more faithful to the book (since King wrote the teleplay, that's not a huge surprise)."	4.0	Classic...with caveats.	2013-01-23	0	0	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A26WVK274IA7DN	Sarah Bellum	Why is it we love Jack Nicholson even as he attempts to murder his wife and son? He is one of those actors who is always a delight to watch, whatever his character's disposition. Jack Torrance (Nicholson) agrees to take care of a hotel in the off season so he can work on his writing in peace, so his wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, tag along. They should have realized they were not as alone as they thought because their son's friend, Tony, apprised them of this via shining. Does Jack really love his family the way he says he does? Is it true alcohol makes us hurt the people closest to us, or is it a demon of another sort? The unique pleasure of a Kubrick film is not necessarily the story itself; rather, it is the unique way in which he tells it. Watch his movies for the performances he coaxes from the actors, for the deliberate pacing or for his sardonic humor. Much the way Frank Sinatra could take any song and make it his own, Kubrick could take any source material and brand it indelibly with his own distinctive mark. Pure cinematic enjoyment. As an aside, I would dread being in Stephen King's family. Is Jack Torrance his alter ego? Does he fantasize about killing his family? Nah, but one has to wonder why so many of his stories involve writers...	5.0	"""They had to be corrected, too"""	2006-09-21	6	2	4

As soon as we meet him in the interview, he already looks like a maniac. Yes, it's creepy. But Torrance in the novel is a well crafted deep character who was butchered in the movie.Secondly, Shelley Duvall is pathetic, annoying, weak, and unattractive as Wendy. Again, her performance is one dimensional. In the novel she is strong willed,smart, and a natural mother. Not so much in the book. Her nonchalant attitude about Jack breaking her sons arm is insulting to mothers everywhere and to Stephen kings work.I won't criticize the little boys performance but I agree with the others about the finger thing being incredibly stupid.From what I've seen the director was a bit of a tyrant. It shows in the actors performances. I mean...Jack Nicholson is the shining is nothing like Jack Nicholson in one flew over the cuckoos nest.	2.0	good movie...if uve never read the book	2014-04-30	0	0	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3LVDCA9L214L3	S. Aversa	I'm not usually one of those people that tries to compare a movie to the book.  In my opinion, nothing will beat the movie we build in our minds by reading, over somebody else's vision played out in a movie.  However, Stanley Kubrick really missed the mark on this one.  Even Stephen King hated the movie, saying that it was nice to look at but empty, comparing it to a beautiful car with no engine.  The movie drags and drags.  Shelly Duvall was horribly cast and terrible to look at.  Daniel Lloyd was good, but wasn't in with the script to truly understand his character.  The only performance that was worth its weight, was from Jack Nicholson, and even his was a shallow character that was more content making crazy faces than building up a character who loses all connection with reality in a hotel that has supernatural hauntings.Look, if you love this movie, that's okay.  I would suggest, however, that you read the book.  It is a wonderful read and very different from the movie.  Stanley Kubrick clearly had a vision when making the film, it's just a shame it wasn't the same one that King laid out in the book.	2.0	Ugh	2013-10-27	1	0	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A37L14A5MAC4X	"Scallenger ""Derrick Davis"""	First off, rumor control:1) This film was meant to be seen in widescreen as it is in this new DVD release. And yes you do see a little bit more on the sides (yet a little bit less on the top and bottom) due to this being an open matte film. The film looks great either way, and I prefer watching it this way.2) This -is- the US 144 minute cut of the film. Even the amazon page has FINALLY updated itself. So those that gave this a negative review based on that information should retract their review.The bonus features, while not extensive, are satisfying. The approx 30 minute new retrospective making-of doc has some pretty interesting information on the making of the film, with a lot of different people talking about it and how it was made, with constant appreciation to Kubrick. However, anyone who has read this film's trivia on imdb.com pretty much knows all that is talked about in concerns of the making of the film.There is a shorter piece on the visionary look of the film and the way Kubrick stylized it. An even shorter featurette is of one of the film's composers who came up with the original music for the film. It's a nice piece, but almost feels useless since her music wasn't used in the film much (mostly replaced by classical) and she only talks about The Shining for half of its already short running time (the rest spent on her work for Clockwork Orange, and although interesting, it is not related). Also included from the previous DVD release is the documentary of the film by Vivian Kubrick (his daughter) and the film's trailer.Also new to this release is a commentary by an author of Kubrick's works and the inventor of the steady-cam who worked on a lot of the filming of The Shining. Although not a bad commentary, they tend to repeat themselves within the time span of the film, repeat things from the documentaries, and even not speak at all for long intervals. What's worse is that the two people were obviously recorded at different times and edited together. However, there were occasional interesting remarks and stories of the film shoot not heard about elsewhere, but this definitely could have been better.Overall, this is an amazing film and got a pretty decent special edition with a beautiful Widescreen transfer to boot. I would give this 4 stars based on the disappointing commentary, but since so many people gave this premature ratings because of the running time they thought it had, I am giving it a boost. May Kubrick live on through his art like this.	5.0	One Of The Best Horror Movies Ever Gets A Good DVD Release	2007-10-24	9	8	1

The little boy moving his finger and saying &quot;Redrum&quot; in that growly voice is also embarassing. Shelly Duvall was so obnoxious and whiny you almost wanted something to happen to her; not sympathetic at all, neither was the little boy. There were fleeting moments of tension and great photography, period. Another, later version, was far better than this, and stuck to King's original story, which needed no guilding/amplifying/re-creating. Nicholson's smarminess, Duvall's crying and whining, and the little boy with his &quot;redrum&quot; were enough to send me screaming fomr the room...not from the horror but from the embarassingly bad peformances, screenplay and direction. Love Kubrick, Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece, but this one...well, I've already said it. Stephen King is a great writer; bring his stories to the screen as he wrote them! PLEASE! When other people try to change his books, the result is almost always catastrophically bad, case in point.	3.0	3 Stars only for the cinematography	2003-10-31	16	3	13

The boy Danny has special abilities:  a secret friend inhabiting him (which is not satisfactorily explained) and the ability to hear others' thoughts (the Shining).  But buildings can have shinings too.  Homicidal rages from a formerly easy going author (typing nonstop pages of ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" is hilarious) taking orders from the ghosts and supernatural beings that in habit the hotel.Stanley Kubrick (2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)) is known for his almost maniacal style in doing take after take.  Shelly Duvall had the most number of takes ever, I read.The movie does have its chilling, insane moments.  I enjoyed the boy's horror but was not sure if it was ""Tony"" his imaginary friend talking or Danny himself.

But i didn't like The Shining the first time I saw it.&quot; This is what Spielberg says about The Shining when interviewed by Paul Joyce, in the documentary found at the EWS dvd. Well, that's not a bit different from myself experience with this movie. This film has layers of meaning, each time you see it is like you're pulling one of this layers up.  And with sure some fans of Stephen King will not like it, but that's because they want see a simple transfer for the movies of King's book.  I myself always liked King books, I read maybe all the classic King books. But Kubrick is not a entertainment director, this guy is craftsman, he delayed about 5 years inbetween his works to make this movies look like deep masterpieces, since Barry Lyndon this goal is bright clear in Kubrick work. So, Kubrick would never do a simple transfer of King's book, he saw in adapting this book a way of grafting in it his own authoral work. Therefore if you like art films you'll enjoy it, without of course judging it for being, at least at surface, a horror movie.	4.0	A Work of Intriguing Simbolism	2001-05-26	0	0	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2JBVXCOTDW8XS	Sean Wheeler	This should serve as a pre-warning to Stephen King fans: stay away!!!  Yes, indeed, Stanley Kubrick did take liberties with King's 1977 novel.  But is this a crime?  Kubrick's entire approach to filmmaking is based on taking a well-know piece of literature and twisting it to meet his own artistic vision.  And what a vision it is!  While there is a genuine sense of dread permeating throughout the film, it actually plays more successfully as a sly satire of the horror genre than as the real deal.  Jack Nicholson's performance, for example, is a comedic one; there is no way one could get through the classic bar scene without cracking a smile.  Nicholson winks at the audience from the very beginning; his dialogue during early scenes is tinted with a benign sarcasm.  Once he begins to lose it, he loses it ten-fold!  Jack has never been as charismatically psycho as he is here.As with most of Kubrick's films, every character (from Shelley Duvall's spacey housewife to the hilariously WASP-y hotel manager) comes off as a one-dimensional parody of their real-life counterpart.  Why?  Because Kubrick's primary objective is to satirize human behavior, to reveal all of the absurdities and contradictions so commonplace in &quot;civilized&quot; society (check out &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;).  And it all takes place within one of the finest set designs ever used in a Hollywood film.  Kurick's approach to horror is take-it-or-leave-it, but there's no denying this is a milestone picture and a work of art.  If there ever was a testament to the enormous talents of both Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson, this it is.	5.0	Ultimate Black Comedy	2001-10-27	1	1	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T	Sesho	"Jack Torance (Jack Nicholson), ex-school teacher, fancies himself a budding writer, and thinks he's found the perfect job to bring his fermenting ideas to fruition. He gets a gig as off-season caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, an isolated ski resort that is open from May to October, until the roads that lead to it get snowed over. That means that Jack will have 6 months to write a book, play, or whatever else he wants to do. He's also bringing his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and his psychic son, Danny (Danny Lloyd). Danny has been told by his imaginary friend (actually a manifestation of his psychic powers) , that bad things are gonna go down at the Overlook. Apparently, the hotel has a strong paranormal aura that Danny's arrival will only cause to be amplified. It's something that's never brought up in the film. Danny's powers, his ""shine"", is what causes everything to happen. Probably a normal kid would not have caused as much reaction by the hotel. In the opening scenes of Jack's interview, we learn about one of the previous caretakers that killed his wife and twin girls with an axe ten years previously. When Danny gets to the hotel he just happens to see two creepy twin girls when he's playing darts. Jack is also a recovering drinker who once dislocated Danny's arm while he was drunk. So, haunted hotel, psychic kid whose powers amplify the haunting, alcoholic dad with frustrating writers block...um, it's not going to be pretty.The main problem this movie has is that Jack (that's Jack AND Jack Nicholson) can't really descend into madness because he ALREADY seems half crazy at the beginning of the movie. Or just WEIRD. Any normal person would look at Jack and KNOW he's not someone you would want to get snowbound with for 6 months. Wendy as played by Shelley Duvall doesn't seem to be playing with a full deck either. Danny seems to be the most qualified by default to deal with the horror of the Overlook Hotel. On Wikipedia, it says that Robin Williams of all people was considered for the role of Jack, but Nicholson does a pretty good job of channeling him. His performance also reminded me a lot of Jim Carrey, or actually Nicholson's own turn as the Joker. Actually, the Joker seemed a bit more sane and less strange than Jack in The Shining.Nicholson does a lot better portraying insanity when he's not talking and Kubrick is able to just focus on his body language and expressions. Overall, the acting seemed very operatic or even silent movie era. Everything is taken to such an extreme, which is not a trademark for Kubrick. It's almost as if the MOVIE is suffering from hysteria, not the actors.Which brings me to another point. The real menace of The Shining is the ambience, the atmosphere of the hotel. I've always found something creepy about empty places meant to be filled with people. Just the fact that you have this huge hotel being perfectly still gives me chill bumps. And the way Kubrick perfectly frames the rooms and uses disquieting color schemes just adds to the effect. It's a shame that Kubrick's movie only really inspires horror when it's quiet. When it's not goading its actors into almost comical expressions of fear and lunacy.I enjoyed watching this movie again since I hadn't seen it in ages. My real purpose was to get myself ready to watch Room 237, the documentary about all the weird symbolism and theories about the true meaning of this film.Also definitely check out the novel by Stephen King, which is even better than the movie!"	4.0	I'M NOT CRAZY	2013-04-21	0	0	0

And that's not the end of the world, because they've got a pretty nice ballroom for parties. Oh, and they wouldn't take my credit card for payment. They'd never heard of Visa.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3INKJOWP0G8J	Shane Herrinton	A Stanely Kubrick classic and arguably the best Stephen King adaption. Made famous with an amazing performance from Jack Nickolson and surprisingly Shelly Duvall. Filled with smart and twisted vielence and a nag for making you twich in a bazzare and horrifying fassion. A film far apart from other Kubrick films and other horror films. This DVD version contains a well put together and enjoyable set of special features unlike most DVD's packed with bonus material no one wants to whatch (MatrixTrilogy). It's fun to watch the constant feud between Stanely Kubrick and Shelly Duvall throughout the behind the scenes extra footage. The one strong dissapointment I experianced and has held me back from purchasing it is how lame the case is. Maybe I'm just shallow when it comes to DVD's but it's been many years sense the've come out with a new addition. A 2-disc Anniversary Edition with a hot sexy slip case would be awesome compared to those stupid snap cases with no place for a booklet or pamflet. If you are'nt held back by that, then buy it because it is indeed a terrific film and a horror collectors must!	3.0	Great Horror - Lame DVD	2005-08-22	5	1	4
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AGXBNK2WXZ8HU	Shannon Davis	The Shining is the best scary movie of all time! The movie is so twisted that it makes you cringe for more! Nicholson is outstanding- he plays his part with so much fire that it is hard to tell that he is sane at all. The  Shining is not your run of the mill Mike Myers movie, but a pyschological  thriller that sets your mind on a roller coaster of delightful horror and  intrigue. The ending leaves you in a somewhat confused, but fearful way  that makes you want to watch the movie over and over again.

It also has a lot of bonus material to keep the viewer happy.

Honestly, I have never read the book, so I guess you can take that statement half serious. My second favorite is ""The Mist"", still having never read the book.Any tweener or twenty-something that has never seen this really owes it to themselves to watch this masterpiece. Patience is necessary as you need to watch every scene and let it build. There is absolutely no CGI, of course.. and this film uses spectacular camera work, background noise, and the best visual effects of the time to produce some very chilling scenes. It's jump out of your seat scary.This film makes junk like ""13 Ghosts"" look pathetic! If you think that was scary, watch ""The Shining"". I stress to you that you must watch the original and not the remake with Steven Wright.Pop culture has borrowed much from this film, from recent TV commericals (where a family was booked in a place similar to ""The Overlook"") and of course lines like ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"".Highly recommended to all!

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1OOYXSUI4Z943	"""sideshowmatthew"""	"""The Shining"" is a haunting film, featuring the marvelous performance of Jack Nicholson. The movie is not really based on the book. It's just got some striking similarities, but mostly, it is a totally different thing entirely. Jack Nicholson is not just scary, but also, quite comical in his role as the madman recovering alcholoic author father who is taking care of the Overlook Hotel. He's endeavoring to fix up his act, write a book, and take care of the hotel while the owners are away during the winter. But, he develops writer's block, is isolated by the snow that surrounds the hotel. He soon sees the bar in the hotel is filled with ghosts that offer him booze. He drinks to his heart's delight. Finally, a drunken, hostile, isolated Jack goes insane, attempting to murder his wife. His child, Danny, can see haunting images of evil in the Overlook Hotel. Jack goes after his wife and son with an axe. It is a very strange yet interesting film, filled with horror, evil, terror, and some probably unintentional comedy. I recommend this film, but fans of the book may be disappointed. It is not nearly as detailed as the book. In the novel, Jack is a semi-normal guy going through some recovering alcoholic problems. In the movie, Jack is always kind of crazy. The hotel is a cramped, dizzy, ugly place, and, if I recall correctly, in the book the hotel was a big and beautiful place. Still, it is a great film, but only because of Jack Nicholson's performance."	4.0	REDRUM...REDRUM...HEEEEERE'S JOHNNY!	2002-12-31	8	2	6
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3UA046AA3DXFD	Sid the Elf	"Of course Sid the Elf is very familiar with The Shining. But we hadn't reviewed it until now. Why? Good question. For October Horrorgreatsuccess Sid festival it was a no-brainer. This is one is in the pantheon of horror films. Also, Scatman Crothers has been a Sid favorite since 96 and the crazy likely homeless nutjob at Yankee Stadium. Sid has seen bits and pieces(that's what it's like...u know where it's going) of this film many times over the years but this viewing was a little different. This time Sid was watching with his carefully crafted critical eye gained with thousands of B's on our odometer.Knowing full well what happens in the movie, after not seeing it for at least a few years, Sid found Jack really interesting. Even in the begining of the flick you can see that he's a little psycho. And while we're here, could anyone else have played Jack Torrence? Sid says absolutely not. He plays a nutbar to perfection. And nobody else could have pulled off being a maniac and hilarious at the same time(exhibit A: the ""Have you lost your f**kin' mind scene). Now, The Shining is in no way shape or form B, but it is a horror classic so it's in play for Sid. This is especially true when you account for the Chuck factor and the awesome visuals accompanied by cool/creepy music.The Shining was an overall awesome experiance. It is obviously a must for any horror fan who hasn't seen it. Also, if you're a horror fan and haven't seen this movie, shame on you. If you're missing the B element in this Sid review, don't worry. There are several B's on the horizon. Can Sid interest anyone in a little Maniac Cop? As for The Shining, here's a quick rundown of the film's scariest moments:1. The dog and the butler.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3RHX8H7UF8C5R	Simon	As far as I am concerned, this is a finely honed horror story, scary as hell... with incredible performances by Duvall and Nicholson... and the hotel and the music.  Since so many reviewers cover the plot so well, I'll concentrate on some other points... Kubrick's masterful use of brilliant lighting to convey the horrors, the wonderful sets, and the music. One of the high moments of sheer horror for me was when Shelley Duvall found Jack's writing. No blood, no axes, no knives, no shouting, no threats...  nothing but her realization that the husband she loves almost to the point of worship is insane.Until this moment, even we in the audience didn't realize how psychotic Jack is, but this punches that fact right into our souls. Maybe, we can think, at an earlier time, that he doesn't want his wife to see the wretched manuscript because it isn't any good, or because he isn't satisfied with it.  Once seen, it's clear that the man not only has become insane, but that he's always been insane, maybe even before he stepped through the door.Mother and son have been living with a madman, maybe all their lives. I think Danny realizes this. Tony has misgivings about the place, and leaks these premonitions into Danny's mind. I take it that Tony is a manifestation of his Shining, not a figment of his young mind. Is Tony trying to guard little Danny? Or is there a fight to see who controls Danny's body? Does Danny have both his father and Tony to fear? I don't think so. Tony does `take over', but Danny comes back. The kid shows a feisty nature and comes through with flying colors in a horrible situation.Shelley's character is no match, it seems, for the raw,uncaring brutality of her sot of a husband, but she comes through for herself and her child. Wendy comes across extremely strongly as being ineffectual and weak, thanks to the wonderful performance of Shelley Duvall. Wendy is hysterical, and it's clear how much  she wants to love him, in spite of Jack's cold hatred.  When push comes to shove, however, she stops him cold, as much as it's within her power to do- then it's Jack who's seen to be the weakling, as shown by his `final' meeting with Delbert Grady.Speaking of Grady...  he's only in a small part of the film, and is such a polite man; servile to the point of being sickening. However, his hatred is chilling. Grady is a ghost, but has the attitudes of a demon, hateful and intolerant. In spite of the fact that Jack was caretaker long before him (See the photo Kubrick slowly zooms in on at the end.), Grady is clearly the Boss and is calling the shots. He might as well be Satan, with the Overlook Hotel as his earthly abode, during the winter months. The bartender is part of the horror. In spite of the fact that he looks entirely human, Kubrick's masterful lighting brings something of the outer dark to what at first seems to be a throwaway character.The music, from the first ominous bars of Dies Irae,  sets the mood for the story  and takes the spare plot into the upper stratosphere of horror.  I've seldom heard such scary and horrifying compositions in any movie. The Dies Irae  is familiar to me, and is an old piece of music, going back at least into the nineteenth century. The other horrifying pieces sound very modern to my ears; discordant and creepy.  They just point out Kubrick's genius  in setting the mood. Without it, I don't think The Shining would have worked out as well as a horror film as it did, in spite of Jack Nicholson's incredible performance as Jack Torrance. The man-in-a-bear-suit scene was frightening because of its sheer inanity, and the hints of sexual perversity. What were those people doing? Under many circumstances, whatever they were doing could be viewed as being entirely harmless- a sexual liaison in costume. Big deal. I don't think Delbert Grady's ax murdering of his family was the only atrocity committed and the film hints strongly at this. With that in mind, a viewer can easily expect to see another murdered child or parts of her.Jack Nicholson always turns in wonderful work. He's a total professional and physically fits the role of Jack Torrance like a glove. Thanks to Nicholson's work, we can seriously wonder if Jack Torrance ever was truly sane. And, since the family seems so normal on the surface, it's a frightening thought for the rest of us.The Scatman is affecting, and brings a human perspective lacking in the rest of the cast. Danny, thanks to Tony, almost seems non-human, as though he's a spirit visiting this world from the Other Side. Wendy is hysterical, obviously distraught by their financial situation, then torn asunder by Jack's horrid betrayal. The hotel owner is a cypher, just a necessary plot item needed to explain the Overlook to Jack, and thus to the audience. Delbert Grady and the bartender are ghosts, and rather demonic, at that. The twins can scarcely be seen as human, considering how they stand so still, and work to ensnare little Danny in the Overlook's hellish homicidal insanities. Scatman's character, the chef, seems to provide that human element of caring and love, while keeping sane under a weight of knowledge that would overwhelm a normal person.  All in all, The Shining, under Kubrik, is a cinematic gem.I do not mention King's version, either book, or televison version, for a simple reason... I have not read the book, nor have I seen the show. When I do, I can compare them. The Shining is probably one of the greatest horror films of the 20th century.	5.0	Psychotic and horrifying...

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AJ9W09EUQPAKE	Sirin	The Shining is Kubrick's take on a horror film. Thus it contains multitudes. Embedded meanings and dark nights of the soul that underpin what is essentially a small scale story of isolation and madness in an isolated Colorado hotel. Like the novels of Samuel Beckett, the Shining strips human psychology down to the floorboards. And what is revealed is a wretched and inescapable image of terrible things that men have done in the past, are doing now, and will do again in future time.	4.0	About so much more than horror	2006-09-30	7	1	6

We also had just read the book,usually at night in bed. I remember it raised the small hairs on the nape of my neck. The movie, back then, even though not quite as horrific as the book, did its' job and sufficiently kept us both on the edge of our seats.Today we rented and watched it with a completely different reaction. There were long, boring sections of the movie (over 2 hours) which did little to keep the pace going. We are searching for scary movies for a group of 16 year old girls, (for a birthday party) who look for realistic &#34;could happen&#34; scary flicks to induce screams and clutching each other for support. Sadly, we scratched &#34;The Shining&#34; off the list. As we previewed it, my granddaughter remarked that it had way too much &#34;filler&#34; content. We had to agree. Scary, horror flicks riddled which almost graphic sexual scenes cannot be considered.I remember when, at 17 years of age, &#34;Hush Hush, Sweet Charlotte&#34; had me enhralled and sufficiently frightened to have a few dreams about it. I didn't even suggest that one.	3.0	Have we as viewers become more difficult to please as we view newer horror flicks?	2013-01-30	1	0	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A8GP5U9H4PNOC	slider	I really liked Stanley Kubrick's version of Stephen king's novel.  I think Jack Nicholson was perfect guy for the lead role.  Shelly Duvall, however, was one of the most annoying actresses ever cast in a horror movie.  Yikes!  Rebecca De Mornay put forth a much better performance in the T.V. remake.  Little Danny was great.  I guess the Kubrick and T.V. versions both had their strong points.The old lady in the bathtub scene was, and is, one of the creepiest horror scenes ever filmed.  It made me cringe!  And that slow-pounding heartbeat resonating throughout the movie was more creepy than walking through a morgue in the dark. Jack Nicholson's uncanny ability to bring out the lunatic in his character, with those devilish facial expressions, is an absolute treat to the fans of horror.Still very scary to this day, The Shining is one of my all-time favorite horror movies.

The Shining will always remain one of those ""classic"" horror films. Jack Nicholson was the perfect choice for this movie. He really plays the role to a T!! This movie gives justice to the book. Great acting all around. However, I must say that I prefer the remake of The Shining starring Steven Weber for it gives us a more modern twist on the movie.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A6P9NL0JW2L1M	"S. Niduaza ""menace!"""	"When asked to summarize 'The Shining' in few words, I always respond with, ""It's the greatest movie about writers block ever filmed"".Stanley Kubrick's film is much more psychological than gory or shocking(although it has its fair share of blood), a fact of which is mostly due to an ambiguous quality propelling both the story and the visuals. The film is even more mysterious than the novel, which itself is fairly clear about the big W's (who, what, where, etc). This is why I find the film version superior to the book, because it leaves more room for interpretation and discussion. It's also possible to misconstrue these ambiguities as plot holes but even the films co-writer, Diane Johnson, states (on the DVD featurette) that she and Mr. Kubrick had to ""abide by some inconsistencies"" when dealing with a subject like the supernatural. I think this is a fair explanation considering that the supernatural should be something beyond the reach of human thinking and reason.I've also had plenty arguments with King fans whom can't get past the major changes between the book and the film. If you ask me, the changes have been for the betterment of the film in it's own medium. Consider the Wendy character - In the book she is strong willed and resourceful but still sticks by her husband even though he's a drunk and loses his job. I argue that the timid Wendy of the film seems much more likely to stand by her unstable husband. The image of her with the bat backing away from Jack would be much less powerful had it been a more 'forceful' woman (i.e. character) in the role.Not to mention the acting and the music. You would think that watching three actors rotting in an old hotel for three hours would be boring but it's quite the opposite. Jack Nicholson is wild here, you can tell from the instant you see him, there's something going on in him that's not quite right. And Shelley Duvall is perfect as the shy and loving wife who feels scorned by her husband and confused by her child. The music, a strange mix of synthesizers and classical compositions, sets the feel instantly, creating a dread and suspense uncommon in most other horror schlock.It would be fair to say that 'The Shining' is, if not the best, one of the greatest gothic horror films ever produced. Highly recommended."	5.0	An Epic, 'Thinking-Mans' Horror Film	2008-10-19	2	1	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2FPD5N9PM5I6X	Sonja Foust	On my Stephen King kick. I was disappointed in this movie. The music was WAAAAAY over the top. The acting was very good (especially Jack Nicholson-- CREEPY!), however, and I was scared. Still, I felt like I didn't really know what was going on and there wasn't enough development of the story. At two hours and some change, it's not short, but they spend too much time on the set-up and not enough on the development. (I know it's hard to make a novel into a movie. Guess this is just one of those shortfalls.) Anyway, it was scary, and I did look over my shoulder in the shower once or twice this morning.	4.0	CREEPY!	2005-03-17	6	2	4

Dick has a secret power, and little does Danny know, that he posseses the same power, the ability to know things before they happen. According to Mr. Holloran, this secret power is called The Shining. When Jack Torrence is tormented by the deceased spirits of the last caretakers of the hotel, did I mention that they are spending the winter at the hotel to look over it?, he slowly starts to transform from his fatherly ways of living, and turns into a crazed maniac who is determined to slaughter his family, as did Mr. Mcgrady, the previous caretaker. Inspite of Danny's secret message that he keeps speaking to his mother, REDRUM, Mrs. Torrence continues to try and help her husband in anyways possiable.

The second time, you know what's coming, which takes the edge off of it.But the second time you see it, you get to take in each scene and see how Kubrick filmed it. You notice a lot of structural ideas --- the way things are set up for maximum effect. For example, when Jack meets the former caretaker in the bathroom, their entire bodies fill the screen and they stare at each other. You wonder if they are going to punch each other or just talk. The room is silent and cold and clean.Every scene has that kind of special structure. It keeps you slightly off-balance for the entire film. On DVD, you can watch each scene over and over, pick them apart, and see the details under the surface.	5.0	One of the best films ever made	2003-10-18	6	2	4
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A29BQ6B90Y1R5F	S. Rhodes	"It's amazing how many people didn't read the book before seeing the film (especially if you read reviews of the book).  I'm one of the few people who read the book before seeing what was so commonly called ""Kubrick's Masterpiece.""Is The Shining a good movie?  Sure it is.  It's a great movie if you put the book aside and forget it's supposed to be based off the book.  In it's own right, it is a good film.  But for the book... it really isn't all it's cracked up to be.To put it simply, the movie doesn't really follow the book all that well.  It's almost an original film.  That shouldn't suggest it's a bad film though.  As I said, in its own right it's a farily good film.  But if you really do want to compare it to the book, you'll find yourself disappointed.Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, a man who is hired to be a caretaker of the Overlook Hotel during the harsh winter.  But there's a history behind the hotel that only those gifted with ""The Shining"" know.  And only Jack's son Danny really knows.The movie actually is easy to understand (some reviewer said it wasn't) if you actually watch the film.  It really is one of those movies that if you stick with it, your questions will be answered.  Although, there are some moments from the book I wish they would've included.  For example, Danny's ""Shining"" isn't explained very well, and the movie never actually touches base with where the Overlook's employees go on their time off. Somwhere along the lines one of the characters winds up in Miami but the movie never tells you why he's there (or that he actually ever went). The book explains everything.  One should not have to wonder why a character is where they are... especially if the character runs off to a different state without so much as a word or picture from the director.There are other little things that can be buggy about the film.  A kid has an ""imaginary"" friend named Tony.  He says Tony lives in his mouth, but the movie shows us that Tony is his finger.  I won't go on to tell you more about the book, but that already doesn't make much sense.  That and REDRUM doesn't really play any significance in the movie the way it did in the book.Now at first I thought I was going to hate this movie, but there was some saving grace: When Jack goes insane and tries to kill his family.The moment Jack starts talking to Lloyd, the bartender (who is actually a ghost) the movie starts to pick up, and you forget it's supposed to be based off a book.  This is because Jack Nichelson really gets into the part and finally starts to do some acting.The entire chase between Danny and his father is perhaps the most memorable moment in the movie.  There are other memorable parts as well.  Take the moment when Jack smashes though the door, pokes his head in and says ""Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeere's Johnny!""  It's a classic line.The movie is also scary.  Is it as scary as the book?  Not by a long shot!  The book was perhaps the scariest piece of fiction I've ever read, but the movie doesn't hit that level.Really, if you forget it's supposed to be based off the classic novel by Stephen King then you will love this movie!  But if you're a purist of the book, you'll quickly find yourself hating the movie fast.  Luckily, I'm not a purist, only someone who likes to compare.In it's own right, it's a good film.  When compared to the book; it's woozy and neglects to explain or touch base with anything.  It's well directed and scripted, but sometimes it seems to forget that there is an audience who will want answers to questions.  And to some of them, you'll have to read the book."	4.0	A Good Film but for purest of the book, not as good.	2005-01-30	6	3	3

It falls from grace to a level never reached in cinema with the charcters,  the setting,  the lighting,  the blocking and the set decoration.Although Nicholson's performance is superb,  it is ON point:  I think the supporting cast is far better,  that is saying so much btw.  Duvall's performance is so believable that one cannot help but be mesmerized by the on screen performance.  Danny Lloyd's performance is one of the greatest child performances ever filmed.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	There is much discussion elsewhere on 'The Shining' in terms of plot summary, acting, and value so I won't get into that. My reviews are strictly regarding the transfer from Standard Definition to Blu Ray .The Shining displays a beautiful video transfer with natural colorizations showing off Kubrick's wonderful lens craft and cinematography. There was no unnatural grain, artifacts or aliasing to be found. The video transfer was exceptionally done.The film begins to play as soon as you put the disc in and the audio defaults to DD 5.1 . You will need to go to the menu to switch the audio to PCM 5.1  lossless audio. It does make a big difference. However, the audio transfer really only uses the front stage and there is very little use of any discreet audio to either the rear channels or from the LFE channel. The front stereo separation is good but, except for the film's music score, this is still a dialogue driven film so don't expect much from your surround system. The video transfer remains the star. The movie is getting on in years but it holds up and has legs, just wish they had put as much effort into remastering the audio as they did with the fine video transfer.The Shining does come with plenty of supplementary extras and a large variety of language choices. The extras, I found to be worthwhile and interesting..most dated at 2007. Thankfully, there were no advertisement trailers for other movies.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks	4.0	The Shining on Blu Ray	2012-12-13	4	4	0

I really don't have any interest is who is 'right' with the aspect ratio argument, I compared both versions and found that you're missing some of the video image regardless of which version you buy. I took screenshots of both DVDs and overlayed them on top of each other. I found that with the 2001 release, you get the 1:33:1 aspect ratio where the far left and right of the screen image is clipped. With the 2007 release, you get the 1.78:1 aspect ratio where the top and bottom of the screen image is clipped off. You can see what I mean by viewing the 'customer image' I posted, above. The blue border is for the 2001 release and the red border is the 2007 release.Both DVDs are 'digitally restored and remastered', however the 2007 release is noticeabley brighter and more vivid. The 2001 image seems faded and dull.This release has all the other special features of the 2001 DVD release, with the addition of optional commentary by Garrett Brown and John Baxter and three new featurettes.	5.0	2001 DVD vs 2007 DVD	2007-10-23	307	279	28

Everyone in the cast gives great performances, and the direction is super, but the real star of the film is the Overlook Hotel. WOW. Creepiness. The way the camera ventures around the place is totally freaky, cause you have no idea whats going to be around the next corner...Basically, its about a man driven to insanity when he and his family volunteer to be caretakers at the Overlook for the summertime. Gradually, Jack Nicholson becomes very hostile towards his wife and son, all brought on by &quot;cabin fever&quot;. As the spirits that live within the hotel begin to appear to Jack, things get weirder and weirder. This all leads to the cat-and-mouse finale, which is horrifying.You must buy this horror classic on video or DVD! Highly recommended!	5.0	A great movie to watch on a rainy day!	2002-04-15	1	1	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	When I figured out my Top 10 horror movies, The Shining took the top spot. I'm not a fan of campy comedy-horror, so the list is dominated by psychological horror. The Shining is that and a whole lot more. It begins like a drama and takes plenty of time to establish its world, and the majority of the film takes place in the Overlook Hotel.The opening shots are incredible and set the mood. We are shown a car driving along a mountain road. Kubrick sweeps across the countryside so we can see how isolated the Overlook Hotel would be if the only access road was blocked by snow.Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a recovering alcoholic and he's applying for a winter job as caretaker of the hotel. He'll live there for six months with his wife, Wendy (Duvall), and their young son, Danny (Lloyd).What is shining? It appears to be a form of extrasensory perception. We learn that Danny has the ability and so does the hotel's cook, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers). They can communicate without words. Danny's parents know that he talks to Tony, his imaginary friend, but they aren't aware that he has the shining.I mentioned that the film takes time setting things up. We are shown the hotel in great detail. They live in an apartment inside the hotel and Wendy spends most of her time there. Jack uses one of the large rooms to work on his novel and Danny explores by driving around the halls in his toy car.The film is 32 years old, so spoilers won't be a problem for most people, but stop reading now if you are about to see it for the first time.***Spoiler Alert***The hotel appears to be populated by ghosts. All three people see them while they are alone, so that suggests that the ghosts really do exist. Another explanation would be that all the events are happening inside the mind of one of the characters, or that the hotel itself is 'alive' and remembering some of the events that occurred within its walls. I tend to believe that the ghosts and everything we see is real. That would explain all of the events, including how Jack escapes from a locked room and why Danny has marks on his neck.Time is another factor. Some of the occurrences involve one of the characters visiting the past. Wendy sees guests at a party and Jack interacts with Grady and Lloyd. Sometimes the ballroom is filled with people from the past.Danny's gift is extremely powerful and attracts the attention of Dick when he is 2,000 miles away. Dick's attempts to intervene are significantly different from the story told in Stephen King's book, and Kubrick makes a lot of other changes. I like both versions of the story, but I have to admit that Kubrick's changes played out well on the screen.The dialogue is sparse, but very satisfying at times. I particularly enjoy the exchanges when Jack is talking to Lloyd and Grady. Nicholson is convincing when he acts crazy and the final act shows him at his crazy best. Is his transformation some kind of mental illness, or possession by the spirits that occupy the hotel?The black and white photograph near the end of the film shows Jack attending a 1921 party at the hotel. Grady says at one point that Jack is the caretaker and has always been the caretaker. Is this some kind of living hell? Suppose Jack has had a number of families throughout some kind of supernatural existence and he's been bringing them to the hotel without any previous knowledge of those he has brought there before? He mentions at the start that he's experiencing d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and knows what is around every corner.One shot shows him looking rather demonic. Is he in fact a demon or Satan?What's your take on The Shining? What's your version of the truth?The Blu-ray presentation is one of the best for an older movie. Fans should definitely upgrade.	5.0	The best horror film ever made? It's certainly in the discussion.	2012-03-20	5	4	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1O80PSB9GURAC	Stewart	I'm sorry, but I think &quot;The Shining&quot; is a completely overrated horror film. I had heard about how incredibly scary it was, but when I saw it, I was so disappointed. Some scenes were creepy, but overall, it just wasn't enough. Most of the film moved so unbearably slowly that my patience was lost at about the one-hour mark. Director Stanley Kubrick probably likes to do this: wear out the viewer's welcome by letting a film drag on forever. He did this with &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, and he does it again here. These two films are both visually stimulating, but they don't resonate with the viewer emotionally. Both story and character development are compromised by the dazzling but dull visual details that Kubrick brings to the table. Jack Nicholson and Scatman Crothers are both great actors in this film, but Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd are rather dull and lifeless. In the end, if you want a good psychological thriller, see &quot;Misery&quot; or &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; instead of &quot;The Shining&quot;.	2.0	The most overrated horror movie ever.	2003-06-24	9	5	4
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A20OAXYMR3PTGQ	stickgirl	"When I was 12 (oh so long ago) back in the early 80's I stumbled upon Stephen King (well, not literally, he was in Maine at the time:) and from my first read (I think it was one of his short story collections) I devoured each and every book he came out with.  I remember reading the Shining feverishly in my basement (it helped with the atmosphere) and thinking it was just about the best thing I had ever read.  I sailed through it, and literally the moment after I read the last sentence, I hopped on my Schwinn 10 Speed and peddled like crazy down to the local VHS rental store.  I just knew the movie was going to be great, how could it not be?  Well, about 10 minutes into the movie I became horrified to learn that Kubrik had filmed his own vision, not Stephen's.  Tony as a finger?!?  ""Ullman didn't even like Jack, for cryin' out loud!!!"" I was reduced to yelling at the TV.  Even the casting was insulting; never in a million years did I picture Shelly Duvall as Wendy, and Jack?? His innate craziness erased all of the pathos of the Jack Torrance character.  Ultimately, my grand vision was deflated and I sat in a depressive like state wondering how Stephen could let him do this.  Disappointed was an understatement, I was mad!  From that day, I vowed never to view that movie again. Well, a decade later I had calmed down and decided it was worth another chance.  And to my surprise, I realized that I liked the movie.  I just watched it again this weekend (thank you powers that be for the gift that is the CHILLER Channel!) and found that it scared me just about as bad as the book.  But in a totally different way.  As long as I keep it a separate entity from the book, it stands on it's own as one creepy ride!  (Listening to that classical track in the beginning as they drive through the mountains makes me uneasy every time).  Kubrik's Shining should not be thought of as a movie version of the book, in fact, don't even think of them together... you'll be happier that way.  Just enjoy both, on their own for the different scares they provide, and thank your lucky stars that we have them.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A23Q1T4MXZHFM7	susumu-5	The 1980 movie adaptation of Stephen King's earlier masterpiece thriller faced criticism from some of Stephen King fans and the author himself who later countered with his own version starring Rebacca De Mornay. For sure, the movie differs a lot in a number of counts paricularly the character of the drunken father and the way Daniel was attacked (the movie left out the part animal-shaped garden trees raid on poor Daniel).Nonetheless, the movie still has a lot to offer and and lures us into locked-in horror. Briliant camerawork let the viewer see the way Daniel does the haunted hotel. At first it is nothing at all but as the movie progresses it gradually mean something and makes us scared. Supporting actors did fine job particularly Joe Turkel (best known as Dr. Tyrell in Braderunner), playing the role of Lloyd, the spooky bartender. He appears out of nowhere but stands as if he had been there for a long time. He fittingly invites us into the world of madness which culminates into the last climax.Recommended for a wide variety of movie fans.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A358CBXDEJYBCG	"SystemStructure ""System uses Meditate!  A goo..."	"This movie is very... enigmatic.  It is hard to pin down.  However, one thing is sure, it is a weary, bleary, and slow moving horror.  I think it is because of how slow it is that makes it classic.  It is the very slowness that is the essential factor here.  The lack of action allows the inner demons of the writer to seep out and interact with the cursed hotel.  Like a much better and more down to earth version of Event Horizon, the evil hotel gains knowledge of the inner demons of its inhabitants.  The hotel, of course, concentrates its efforts on the weakest and most unbalanced of the visitors, the writer played by Jack Nicholson.  Already driven to an insane existentialism by his twisted life, Nicholson's character proves easy prey for the evil that lurks in the Overlook Hotel.All in all, it's one of the most classic and slowly horrible of all horror films.  It is enigmatic, slightly obscure, dark and murky in its atmosphere.  Unlike ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" where Nicholson was the only sane person with any sense of direction, in ""The Shining"" he is truly, stark raving mad from the moment we first meet him.  Easy prey for the vicious, swirling, dark maw that is their destination."	5.0	Madman meets Place of Evil	2004-09-03	1	1	0

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A37JFQMMYQ9NWU	telefunken	"The Shining makes one realize how utterly hard, almost impossible it is to make a scary movie. ...But the Shining, jesus this movie is so creepy. It just gets inside your head. It's scary to even think about this movie. I'm certainly not a film student or critic like some of the reviewers here but I'm in awe of Kubrick's accomplishment.I thought as I watched it the last time about how Kubrick engineers this mounting sense of unease and dread in the viewer.I believe that he makes the movie look very unnatural in quite subtle ways. Most scenes are brightly lit, and I noticed that there are not many shadows in the movie. Even in brilliantly lit scenes, you'll notice that things don't cast shadows. The colors are frequently bright pastels but don't have a patina, in other words don't reflect light, don't look at all shiny. I also noticed that so many of the scenes are set up symmetrically. From the scenes in the hallways, to the bathroom meeting between the butler and Jack, to the bedroom of Scatman Crothers, there is frequently a very symmetrical appearance of the room that I find, for some reason, highly unsettling. I think the shot of Crothers watching TV in his Miami bedroom, where the viewer watches from Crothers' viewpoint, and all you can see is his lower legs and feet, the lower half of the bed, and then this highly symmetrical, almost stylized tableaux with the TV, the odd nude painting and wall ornaments, this scene I found very disturbing. I don't know why, it is almost like a Rorschach inkblot releasing some subconscious fear or anxiety. There is also a scene in which the viewer is looking at Jack in bed, then the camera pulls back and you see you were actually seeing his reflection in a mirror, then the camera goes BACK into the mirror for the rest of the scene. It again feels very unnatural and unsettling, as if you can't trust your own eyes. Another unnatural feature is Shelley Duvall. Her performance in this movie has been denigrated but I think it is remarkable. But, she is an unusual looking woman. Coal-black hair, buck teeth, bug eyes, she is just, again, unnatural looking. Definitely not the usual femme fatale or spunky mom. There is never a moment in this movie where she gets a steely look in her eye, or sets her jaw, or makes some cold-blooded comment that lets us know she intends to fight and live. She seems weak,confused and beaten the whole movie. But Duvall can really act weak and confused and horrified. Just check out her face as she begins to read Jack's manuscript (""all work and no play..."") as her expressions veer from interest, to confusion, and finally to horror as she realizes that her husband has truly gone mad. And I love, I mean truly love, the scene where the butler spills something on Jack and then shepherds him into the bathroom to clean him up. Notice this, that you do not see the butler's face for the first two thirds of the scene, except a brief and incomplete glimpse as the spill occurs. Again, to be watching an extended scene in a brightly lit (and highly symmetrical) bathroom with only two actors in the scene and yet not really be able to see one of the actors' face is unnatural and somehow unsettling.And here's this, the scene in the hotel room with the bathing woman. What in the scene lets us know that, as Jack is kissing her, that something is horribly wrong? You can barely see any of her face, just part of her hair and her profile, but she isn't moving at all. She looks dead, although if you stopped the film and examined the frames individually there is nothing to suggest she isn't the beautiful woman  who exited the tub.This is a horrifying scene, again highly symmetrical except for the shower curtain only halfway open. Again, weird,flat pastel colors.The first time I saw this movie, in a theater, when Jack was kissing her, a woman in my row screamed at the top of her lungs in sheer unfiltered terrror, and then,crying, immediately left the theater. This is powerful psychological stuff. An absolute masterpiece of slowly mounting unease and fright.The only other movie that comes even close to this level of subtle terror, of mounting amorphous dread, is Rosemary's Baby.But no horror movie has the ability to get inside my head and truly unnerve me the way The Shining can. An amazing and absolutely essential movie."	5.0	creepiest movie ever made	2002-12-30	3	2	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3DT3LOBEI9FU0	"T. Engle ""trengle"""	"This movie is a true work of art.  It has the gamut of human emotions; fear, humor, tension, anger, sadness.  It is incredibly beautiful and haunting.  While I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, what is most amazing is how absorbed I still become while watching, and I have seen it at least 20 times.I feel sad when people belittle Shelley Duvall's performance, as it is key to making the movie a success.  Some viewers want her to be a more assertive, modern woman.  That would not have worked.  She finds the strength within herself to do what needs to be done, and is in fact quite heroic, despite her mousy nature.  Jack really isn't crazy at the start, Nicholson just LOOKS crazy.  And he is definitely supposed to have some demons. An overly-sympathetic Jack would not have been interesting.  The ambivalence about what's real and what's imagined is a strength of the movie (and there is plenty shown to make the viewer aware that not everything, if anything, is imaginary) There are many classic moments in this movie, but nothing beats ""Gimme the bat....""King purists can watch a (dreadful) version starring Rebecca deMornay and Stephen Weber.  King praised this version as more faithful to his books.  Honestly, none of the good King adaptations followed the book (Shining, Carrie and Misery being the three best) and those that did have been mediocre to bad.I never thought any movie would surpass Jaws as my all-time favorite, but the Shining is the best movie I've ever seen!

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F	"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard"""	"Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances of his career as a caretaker during the winter months at an elite isolated hotel in Colorado that is closed down for the season. At this hotel (way up in the mountains) only he and his wife and son live, and what follows are weeks of hell as Jack (the name of the Nicholson character) becomes almost possessed by outside forces. He becomes arrogant, verbally assaulting, and violent, as he attempts to kill his family. Shelley Duvall is heartbreaking as the desperate wife who tries to escape this hellish hotel with her son. The film (based on the Stephen King novel) was directed by genius Stanley Kubrick who also co-wrote the script. The movie was not without its problems during production: Nicholson was not pleased with the many times in which the script was rewritten, sometimes minutes before the scenes were shot. He eventually quit memorizing pages the night before, instead memorizing the lines given to him before the camera rolled. Shelley Duvall suffered exhaustion from the emotional aspects of her character. For the baseball bat scene Kubrick demanded Shelley do it over and over for a total of 127 takes!. Duvall eventually suffered severe hair loss. When ""The Shining"" was originally released to theatres in 1980 the movie was pretty much forgotten, only becoming a modest success. Most critics even panned the film. However, over the last 30 years the movie has become a true classic thanks to the home video market and huge DVD sales. Truely a scary film with excellent performances, especially by Nicholson, I watched this one three times in one weekend. Very rarely do you get horror films with this kind of acting.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2NSWF8GM5VFYF	The Baron	"Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of Stephen King's novel (The Shining) is not at all faithful to its source.  In fact, Kubrick tosses out much of the novel and instead focuses on main character Jack Torrance's descent into madness.  Much has been made of the fact that Jack, as played by Jack Nicholson, appears to be unbalanced from the first moment he appears on screen, unlike his literary counterpart's gradual transformation.  This is true, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  The family unit of the film can hardly be called a unit at all.  Danny, possessed of a precognitive power dubbed ""the shining,"" shows many signs of having experienced abuse, as does his mother Wendy (Shelley Duvall).  Witness the scene where Danny goes to retrieve his fire truck and instead finds his father sitting on the edge of the bed.  Danny goes to him when called, but there is no love there, no comfort in Daddy's arms.  Wendy basically functions as a slave - doing household chores, preparing the meals, attending to the boiler (something Jack himself was hired to do), catering to her volatile husband and caring for Danny.  Familial relations deteriorate even further as winter sets in and Jack begins feeling the influence of what might possibly be the spirits of the hotel's past.  Kubrick is more vague in this area than King was.  What the Torrances are experiencing may well be manifestations of the supernatural, or perhaps simply the demons of psyches bent beyond repair by violence and hatred, aided no doubt by the isolation of The Overlook Hotel.  The camera prowls the seemingly endless corridors of the Overlook, stalking the Torrance family like some great unseen beast just waiting to pounce.  I love how Kubrick was able to evoke such a feeling of dread and apprehension using wide-open spaces and bright lighting.  The soundtrack, a mixture of electronic music by Wendy Carlos and several pieces of classical music, is simply brilliant and one of horror cinema's truly classic scores.  This film richly deserves the moniker ""masterpiece of modern horror.""  No, it's not the book.  For a more faithful adaptation, viewers have the King-approved mini-series (Stephen King's The Shining  (Two Disc Special Edition)).  For those with an open mind, or those simply seeking to experience one of Stanley Kubrick's best films, The Shining will do nicely, I think."	5.0	A masterpiece of modern horror, indeed!	2013-01-26	0	0	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1WPYY2XLOKAT8	The Completist	"I love THE SHINING with a passion usually reserved for movies like THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW; I bought the Stanley Kubrick boxed set in 2001 and watch it regularly.  I've turned down other Blu-ray editions of Kubrick films (EYES WIDE SHUT and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE) because I didn't think they were up to snuff, but I bought this because it managed to win me over.THE SHINING is a GLORIOUS TRANSFER: the colors and textures are more vibrant and powerful than I have ever seen and seeing all those minor backgrounds details big enough to read easily are a real treat.  The picture is crisp, sharp, clear, and doggone if the movie doesn't look as new as the day it was made.  Kubrick movies are always a bit skimpy on the extras (Kubrick died before DVD took off and didn't leave many leftovers for the medium anyways), but the ""making of"" documentary with commentary also made the crossover, as well as a few new featurettes that aren't that amazing, but do offer some cool new tidbits; my favorite is the one on production design with Kubrick staffers and Garret Brown, where we get to see diagrams and schematics of the set.My one gripe comes from the aspect ratio, which is a never-ending argument with Kubrick movies.  The old DVDs maintained a full-frame aspect ratio while the Blu-ray releases favor the 1.85:1 ratio enhanced to fit the 16:9 screen.  As the diagram on the special features reveals, Kubrick preferred the full-frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio, but always shot to preserve the 1.85:1 for theatrical exhibition.  The problem is, Kubrick's compositions were always strongest from top-to-bottom, not side-to-side, so the widescreen aspect ratio trims off the headroom that was beautifully visible on the old DVD set.  The Blu-ray is presented in 1.85:1 enhanced for 16:9 so it fills the screen; yes you see more image on the sides than you did on DVD, but the shots don't stand out as much because of the missing headroom.So for this reason alone, I trim off one star.  Otherwise, I love this Blu-ray and heavily recommend it."	4.0	Blu-Ray vs. DVD: Blu-Ray mostly wins	2009-11-18	11	9	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A95VRSOD89ABV	The Edible Cannibal	The Shining is a great supernatural horror film from the grand master of filmmaking, Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's films have a undescribably rich quality to them that makes them even harder to forget. This is especially present in The Shining, along with A Clockwork Orange, another favorite of mine, and a classic.The Shining is a gothic horror film about a family Jack, Wendy, and Danny Torrance, who sign on as caretakers of the Overlook Hotel, a rural Colorado hotel that has horrible things lurking every door. Jack is an author experiencing a writer's block. A year earlier, Jack had gotten drunk and broken Danny's arm when he found him fiddling with a manuscript. He comes to the Overlook to get away from everyday distractions and work on his most recent novel. Young Danny has an extrasensory power known only as the shining. This information is told to Danny by the Dick Hallorann, the chef in the Overlook, who shares this eerie sixth sense. He tells Danny that if he is ever in trouble, to contact him using the shining. Danny's confused as to why he would say this, yet Danny has had some disturbing visions himself, and is watching his back. Dick knows about the Overlook's unstable history. Meanwhile, Jack is in a rut, and still can't write. The whole family is feeling claustrophobic, and strangers keep appearing to Jack and Danny. Jack has been recieving alcohol from Lloyd, the ghostly bartender in the dining room who really isn't there, and attending large black-tie parties and gatherings in that same dining room. At a party Jack meets Delbert Grady, a waiter trapped in the Overlook, who Jack has been told about. He tells Jack to kill them. To kill his whole family. Danny is experiencing bizarre visions of ghostly characters. Jack is spiralling into insanity, and he plans to take his family with him. He will further the pattern, put another piece in the puzzle.The Shining is a disturbingly gothic fairy tale horror film that has yet to be matched by any other. One of Kubrick's best, and a modern classic, The Shining is a film that many will enjoy. I suggest going out and renting yourself a copy.The ShiningReleased in 1980Directed by Stanley KubrickStarring Jack Nicholson, Danny Lloyd, Shelly Duvall, Scatman Crothers, Joe Turkel, And Phillip StoneRated R for Violence, Some Sexual Content, Nudity, And Strong Language.If you like this, you might like---A Clockwork Orange, Misery, The Silence Of The Lambs, The Dead Zone, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and 12 Monkeys.	5.0	The Shining-----	2003-01-22	1	0	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AM3M3047HZG79	The Happy Space Invader	I have just bought the DVD of this film and although it is a little light on features, the film still er... &quot;shines&quot; (sorry!).There is an air of tension and creepiness throughout this film which I can only attribute to the clever camera shots which give the impression that the film's protagonists are being constantly watched.  Not in an obvious handheld POV shot either, but in slow tracking shots that follow the subject from a distance, something of a Kubrick trademark.The script always gives the impression that something very bad is about to happen, with some amazing mundane-sounding by ultimately portentious dialogue, particularly in the scene with Jack and the Overlook Hotel's manager and in the scene with Wendy and the social worker discussing Danny's 'accident'.As far as the DVD is concerned, the picture quality and sound are quite poor (especially in the accompanying documentary), however, this does not detract from the overall quality of the DVD, such is the quality of film itself.  And at least, being on DVD, it won't get any worse, unlike my PAL VHS copy...An essential purchase then.NB:  For those of you with widescreen TVs who are worried about the 4:3 ratio, don't worry - Kubrick filmed many of his films in 4:3 but framed them so they could be matted them to 1.66:1 for convention's sake, so you'll find that the 14:9 (or even the 16:9) zoom setting on your TV will look fine.	5.0	Kubrick at his best?	2001-04-26	3	3	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	"I don't think anyone looked more-forward to this movie than I did when it came out in the summer of 1980.  ""The first epic horror film"" was its tagline.  I'd read the novel and ate up the hype and saw it opening day...and then left the theatre a little confused: it didn't scare me.  At all.The critic for Newsweek said that THE SHINING made THE EXORCIST look like ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET BEELZEBUB.  Really?I will say that THE SHINING is probably the most beautifully photographed horror film ever made.  The scene where Jack Torrance sells his soul for a glass of beer to the patient, creepy Lloyd the bartender hints at the evil behind the Overlook Hotel.  Satan closing that simple deal in the cavernous ballroom is one of the film's highlights for me.But the movie never gets any momentum.I've read as many Stanley Kubrick biographies as I can find (some good, some really bad) and I believe the reason THE SHINING doesn't work is fairly simple: Kubrick never believed in an afterlife.  He believed in evil in the world, evil in human beings, but the idea of Satan, ghosts, the supernatural eluded him.Stephen King said in an interview back in 1980 that Kubrick would call him at all hours to pepper him with questions during production.  Questions like, ""Do you believe in God?""(In the Argosy article back then, King said that he told Kubrick that he didn't.  Since his horrible accident, King now tells the same story--except that he now says he told Kubrick he did).And, in my opinion, when you keep this in mind while watching the film, you understand that Kubrick's normally razor-sharp perceptions as a filmmaker appear a little vague and out of focus.  The emphasis shifts from a malevolent haunted house to one guy losing his sanity.The DVD is worth it for Kubrick's daughter's documentary, ""The Making of THE SHINING.""  As a lifelong Kubrick fan (DR. STRANGELOVE is, in modern terms, still Da Bomb), I'd never heard the reclusive director's voice until this DVD came out a few years ago.What I really missed though was the second trailer from 1980, the one they played on TV just before the film was released.  The DVD includes the first trailer--the single shot of the elevator opening to release a tidal wave of blood in the hotel--but does anyone remember the TV commercial?  Wendy Carlos' throbbing main title plays as different shots from the film roll.  No dialogue.  And one of the last shots is Jack with his face pushed through the shattered door--but not the shot from the film!  It's some alternate take (and there were a slew of them).  He's laughing hysterically, his face locked in satanic glee, all teeth and eyebrows...and his eyes are dead with evil.  Somebody, please dig that out!  Over 20 years later and I still remember that!"	3.0	All Growl and No Bite Makes Jack....	2002-09-19	3	1	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AT7W1EXT0PF2Y	The Patriarch	Ok. Anybody that's seen this movie knows about that scene at the end where there is this man in a dog/bear costume. It's the scariest scene in this movie or any other movie for that matter. Some reviewers, such as Howard Tuttleman assume that there was a lot of cut footage that explained the whole dog/man legend. I doubt it though. But the truth may be a lot more terrifying. There is a Scientology book by L. Ron Hubbard called the Creation of human ability. It is a book for high-ranking scientologists but you can find it on ebay sometimes. The cover of this book has...a man in a bear/dog costume. Just one problem this book was written long before the Shining was made. 1954. Just what the hell is going on here?! So I read the book but there is nothing about the man/bear/dog thing on the cover. Is this false advertisement, or is Hubbard trying to tell us something? Or perhaps the director of the shining is trying to tell us something. Maybe the guy just walked on the set that day in the cosutume and he is trying to tell us something. I don't know the answer but there is more to this man/bear/dog thing than people are letting on.	5.0	Legend of the man-faced dog	2007-07-30	5	2	3
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1NSUJJCG73IRF	"The Tweeder ""tweeder16"""	"Director:  Stanley KubrickCast: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scotman Crothers, Barry Nelson, Philip Stone, Joe Turkel, Anne Jackson, Tony Burton.Running Time:  146 minutesRated R for violence and language.Stanley Kubrick is one of the best American directors who ever lived. No recent filmmaker has more effectively depicted ideas and created movies that literally defined generations; such films by Kubrick include ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and most recently Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in the psychosexual thriller ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Twenty years ago, this infinite artist completed ""The Shining,"" one of the scariest movies ever made. The film, based on the similarly horrifying novel by Stephen King, is vivid in its characters and overpoweringly haunting with its terrifying undertones. Stanley Kubrick co-wrote, produced and directed this thriller that is well worth the view.  Jack Nicholson is at his maniacal best as Jack Torrence, a failed writer who takes on the job of winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, located high in the Colorado Rockies. He is advised by the hotel manager (Barry Nelson) that the big requirement for the job is that the person who takes it on should be able to handle five to six months of absolute isolation. One past caretaker couldn't, and went insane, killing his wife and two daughters with a hatchet, and himself with a shotgun.  Nicholson nevertheless takes on the job, and brings his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) up there with him for company. But Lloyd, blessed (or cursed) with extrasensory powers (the ""shining""), is acutely aware of the Overlook's inherent evil, embodied in his mind by the ghosts of the two girls, and in Nicholson's ever-crumbling mind by a sinister barman named Lloyd (Joe Turkel). And once the winter snows shut the Torrence family in, these elements combine with isolation and claustrophobia to turn Nicholson into an axe-wielding maniac.Shot primarily on one vast soundstage in England, ""The Shining"" has some of the most awesome cinematography and production design ever made for a horror movie. The camera work (using the Steadicam, one of its first uses ever) is incredible. Kubrick's choice of music is also very savvy: dissonant works by Bela Bartok, Gyorgy Ligeti, and, most ominously, Krzysztof Penderecki really give the film is epic sense of terror. While grand in scale is its beauty and terror, it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. Jack Nicholson extensively defines Stanley Kubrick's horrific masterpiece. His performance is outstanding, easily the best of his career. He intelligently depicts a character of intensity and raw barbaric depth. Also perfectly cast is Shelley DuVall, performing with fright-inducing intricacy. Danny Lloyd, best compared with today's Haley Joel Osment, is top notch as well.Although ""The Shining"" is a precarious, well-portrayed adaptation, its conclusion is disappointing in the highest regards. With such an effective first and second act and superior character development, we come to expect more than a lazy, disagreeable closing like this; ""The Shining"" does not execute the climax in which it builds.  All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.  Certainly one of the most engrossing and interesting films of the genre, ""The Shining"" will always be adored by some and scrutinized by others; it is this kind of enigmatic triumph that makes cinema so grand and so disappointing in the same breath."	4.0	The Shining  (1980)	2005-12-30	7	3	4

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1MLU5TEBICKG1	"Thomas Speziale ""DionysianPoet"""	The Shining completely fullfills at least some of my criteria for a good horror film.The Shining has ambience/atmosphere. Not all horror films succeed where the Shining succeeds. The two other horror films that possess these qualities to the same degree are the original Halloween and Suspiria.If I were to review this film based only on the ambience it manages to create, it would probably be worth five stars.Ambience and mood are perhaps The Shining's strongest features. The sound trak, also, plays no small role in creating the film's ambience in combination with the cinematography. The acting of the three main characters is above average.Like most horror films, The Shining does not seem to be particularly cerebral or sophisticated - at least in terms of the plot and subject matter. Appearances are deceptive. I believe that the combination of cinematography and music provide a sophisticated experience for any sensitive and sophisticated horror fan.The plot, by itself, is in my opinion a rather empty no brainer; rather it is everything other than the story that combines to make this film into a work of art.	4.0	Atmosphere is The Shining's strong point	2003-09-07	1	0	1

I'll tell you a story... when I was about 11 or 12, I saw this movie for the first time.  I left my friend's house after seeing the scene in the hallway with the two girls (though this scene has been shown on TV millions of times, I won't spoil it) - I ran, at a full sprint - from my buddy's house, down a dark alley, to my house... That feeling has always stayed with me, no matter how many times I see this movie.  If I could have added one thing from the horrible made-for-TV remake and the novel - it would have been the inclusion of the shrub-animals... but, far be it from me to nit pick this one.The music, of course, is a key element in this film, and does much to convey a sense of foreboding and dread.  The long, endless hallways of the hotel, the slow descent into madness of the father - where do I stop?  Brilliant film - an unquestionable must-see for any horror film buff (though there aren't many, I'd wager, who haven't seen this one, and with good reason).Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...	5.0	All-time Top 5 Horror Film - no doubt about it.	2005-09-04	3	1	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1DRI4UVR82SI	Toni R. Tippin	IMO, 'The Shining' is a fantastic movie. So much so, before purchasing the VHS, I taped it from tv..Eventually, I bought the VHS. When DVD's first came out, I had no intention of buying duplicates. 'That is,' except for a few favorites.The Shining, which falls in my favorite catagory, was then bought on DVD.Then, Amazon had a deal, The Shining & The Shining remake, for 'X' price..the set ended up in my collection.Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers played excellent roles. Each character, realistic.Wendy and Danny held haunting looks, Jack, mad. 'wonder if he was acting, lol, and Scatman, going out of his way to help a family he didn't know but pitied.I get goose bumps thinking about The Shining: The howling wind, Jack conversing with the dead, walking around hypnotically, intending to chop up his family, Wendy and Danny hiding and terrified.Although I love Steven King, I wouldn't buy a novel/movie because his name is on the cover. In fact, I prefer his older writing to new. It wouldn't have mattered who wrote The Shining; it was a great story.It's true King wasn't satisfied with the first Shining film. I think he felt cutting certain parts, like the topiary scenes, didn't do his movie justice, didn't express meanings he conveyed through his writing.Yet, he agreed the show would go on, despite his opinions and feelings. The Shining was one of the first movies that made him what he is today.Mention Steven King and most think, Here's Johnny...Another thing. Some people complain the book and movie differs. That's understandable. I can't think of one book, made into a movie, with word by word lines and deeds. Despite the author.Cujo is a good example. Totally different ending.King once said, the only movie he's seen that is true to the book, is Rosemary's Baby. Close, but untrue.For those who love horror, check out The Shining. Rent/buy the tape, don't bother watching on TV. Dubbing ruins it. Not to mention annoying commercials.	5.0	The Shining, 'original version.'	2010-07-21	1	0	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A23JRWMU1DMKGH	tony mac	Stephen King's excellent horror novel was essentially a character study of a family coming apart through the weakness of an alchoholic husband driven over the edge in a remote and spooky off-season hotel. The horror was as much psychological as supernatural, and any film adaptation needed subtle, careful writing and direction to effectively bring this out.Stanley Kubrick was entirely wrong for this project, which badly exposed his limitations as a writer/director. Barry Lyndon had already shown that his very deliberate, technical style, while visually impressive, simply failed to tell human stories or create interesting, believable characters. Acting always looks so stilted in his later movies, probably due to the ridiculous amount of takes he insisted upon, stifling any spontenaity among his performers.Stuck here with just a few characters, most of them hugely miscast, the whole exercise falls apart in terrible scripting, over-wrought performances sometimes bordering on the laughable and clumsy,ham-fisted plot development.If this film did not carry Kubrick's name most reveiwers would recognise it for what it is - dull, uninvolving, badly made and lacking in any thematic point. Sorry Stanley, you couldn't hide behind enigmatic nothingness this time!Two stars are for technical merit only.	2.0	typically over-rated Kubrick fare	2003-02-25	43	10	33

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2H0B1IITU17XP	Travis	This is probably one of the best and most remembered horror movies made. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance fits just a little too well. Stanley Kubrick's overview of the mountains of Colorado makes the viewer feel like a voyeur of an unfolding tragedy, and nothing is even going on. The use of Bela Bartok's music and other original scores alone will make your blood run cold. There are many good elements to this sophisticated movie. &quot;The Shining&quot; is one of the few movies where it's better than the book. One of the creepiest elements of the movie, the maze chase scenes, were completely non-existent in the book. Plus, the story went better for me with a visual aid; i just could not picture a place as big as the Overlook Hotel in my mind. Also, the book obviously doesn't feature the spellbinding music. However, the book doesn't totally surpass the movie. The film version features complicated plot and character turns that never seem to get explained, which is annoying to me.Even though the movie is great, it runs a bit too long, and is somewhat too slow-paced. Perhaps a condensed version would make this film a masterpiece. i definitely recommend this for horror movie fans, but don't walk into it thinking you'll see a whole bunch of blood, guts, and murder (or &quot;redrum&quot; as Danny refers to it). This movie is scary because it messes with your head and makes you think about what it happening.  In a nutshell, this is a movie that belongs in the memory bank of everyone out for a good horror pic.	4.0	Great, but a little long	2000-11-11	8	4	4

Along with an amazing film score and a really creepy film location this is still one of my all time favorites. Although apparently Stephen King never truly liked this adaptation of his book.

Unfortunately I saw this film before I read the book, but I'm smart enough to understand that it extremely bastardized the original story. If you expect to enjoy this film, you have to watch it with the attitude that it's not based on Stephen Kings work at all, but just some really cool horror film that Stanley Kubrick cooked up, otherwise you won't like it at all.

When he arrives there with his wife and son, they learn that the previous caretaker had gone mad. Slowly Jack becomes possessed by the evil, demonic presence in the hotel. The Shining is a perfect example of how a horror movie should be made. It moves along at an even pace & takes you into the hotel of horror where the dead still live.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A220FJEQNGMSRN	Trevor Willsmer	At times Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining feels like Home Alone with jokes (Macauley Culkin's &#34;Oh no!&#34; expression even originates in young Danny Lloyd's reaction to seeing the caretaker's twins), with Jack Nicholson doing the screen's most prolonged Bruce Dern impersonation while a helpless little boy outthinks him and lures him to his own destruction. Nicholson's constant clowning certainly does the film few favors and makes Jack Torrence more standup comedian than fearsome killer, setting the scene for three decades of comedy improv slashers. Many of the film's most effective moments, such as the conversation with the dead caretaker in the men's' room or the conversations with Joseph Turkel's ghostly barman, tend to work in spite of the star's grandstanding rather than because of it. He's at his best in the early scenes or his the genuinely unnerving moment where the sleep deprived Torrence unemotionally and less than reassuringly promises his son he'd never hurt him, but by the time he's broken out the fire axe all that's missing is the hockey mask and the striped sweater. It doesn't help that child actor Danny Lloyd isn't terribly good either (his croaking &#34;redrum&#34; scene makes you glad Warners turned down Kubrick's offer to direct The Exorcist), but he isn't quite disastrous either.Yet the film still manages to hold the attention, even if it is often more of a display of technique and Kubrick's visual precision and fascination with the possibilities of the constantly prowling Steadicam rather than a visceral rollercoaster ride: the polite and accommodating Joseph Turkel is easily one of the most memorable spectres in screen history while the ever so formal Philip Stone as the late caretaker with distinct ideas on disciplining children is an almost equally intriguing creation. And with the novel's original ending that saw the various animals carved out of the maze's hedges coming to life impractical with the special effects of the day, Kubrick's solution is very satisfying even if he does steal one shot wholesale from The Last Hunt. One striking thing about two of the Overlook's permanent residents, however: if the place does still contain echoes of all the bad things that have happened there over the years, that must mean that one particular guest must have got the worst oral sex of all time from the guy in the Pluto costume!Although still cut by three minutes after its premiere, the 146-minute American cut on the Region 1 NTSC DVD works better than the European version that Kubrick himself cut down to two hours. While many of the cuts are pure exposition, with much of the initial tour around the Overlook and all of Anne Jackson's part hitting the cutting room floor, as did part of one of Turkel's scenes, the longer first half of the film means it takes longer for Nicholson to go whacko (in the European version they've barely had time to unpack before he starts slicing up the ham in extra-thick slices). Unfortunately the stereo remix on the DVD tends to dull some of the film's best sound effects, such as the memorable sound of Danny's tricycle as it passes over carpet onto hardwood floor, and the new letterboxed transfer loses detail from the previous fullframe version that Kubrick approved (the overhead shot of the maze in particular).	3.0	Stanley Kubrick's Home Alone	2008-04-28	1	1	0

Stanley Kubrick took all the best bit's and made one hell of a film, negating all the boring parts, aside from the hedge creatures coming to life that would have been impossible to film in 1980.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	When I think of a horror movie, I think of a film that is going to scare me in some way. There doesn't have to be any gore involved, no actual acts of violence need to be shown (the greatest horror directors know that less is more), and I usually am startled at least a couple of times. I didn't find THE SHINING to be a scary movie. At times it was disturbing, but it really never was scary.The movie stars Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, a writer who is hired to be the winter caretaker of a huge hotel in Colorado. The hotel, the Overlook, is over twenty-five miles away from any inhabitants and is in such a secluded area that the place is virtually cut off from the rest of the world during the winter. Jack moves his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) to the hotel with him. Danny has a type of ESP that he learns from the hotel's cook is called the shining. The shining allows him to see events from the past and foresee events in the future and speak into other shiners minds. Danny's gift warns him that the hotel is full of evil and is haunted by ghosts, but even Danny's mother doesn't really listen to Danny until he starts chanting &#34;redrum&#34; in a strange voice. By, then Jack is a total psycho and wants to live up to the ghostly Joneses and butcher his family just like the ghosts that haunt the hotel.Jack Nicholson is usually always a joy to watch and THE SHINING is no exception. His portrayal of a man driven mad by alcoholism, mistakes from the past, cabin fever, and a haunted hotel is riveting. Shelley Duvall pulls of a remarkable job of a wife blinded by false hope to all signs of trouble until it is almost too late. And Danny Lloyd is a delight to watch as the young boy blessed with a gift to powerful to control.Kubrick may have been satirizing the horror genre in this film. Or maybe he wanted to make an &#34;artful&#34; horror movie. I'm not really sure. However, outside of a few disturbing scenes (e.g. the lady in the bathtub), THE SHINING isn't scary. It doesn't cause one to think; it doesn't really examine the nature of evil; and outside of a few famous lines (heeeeere's Johnny) is forgettable. The movie was just plain strange and weird in a very bizarre way. It reminded me of a Coen Brothers picture, but without much taste or class. I don't really know what the big deal is about, but unless you're a huge Kubrick, King, or movie fan I really wouldn't recommend THE SHINING. It's rather dull.	3.0	Madness	2002-03-30	1	1	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A28GZ5XS8DE660	Tyler Disley	When I think of pure terror, I think of movies like The Exorcist and Jaws.  The Shining is not what comes to mind.  I have no idea what is so scary about this film.  The ghosts don't induce any nightmares for me and a guy running around with an axe just isn't terrifying to me.  Maybe it was the mood I was in when I watched it.  I don't know.  But, The Shining was a pretty darn good movie.  With an all-star cast and a legendary director, it makes for a great film.  Any Stanley Kubrick film you watch has the same feeling to it.  He leaves is own little mark on a movie in so many different ways.  Jack Nicholson also leaves his mark on a movie he is in.  From classic ad-libbing to just purely wonderful acting, he can turn a semi good movie into a great movie.  I didn't give it 5 Stars because it did move a little slow at times.  And some of the explanations I needed to understand the movie better just weren't given to me.  But, Overall The Shining was a highly effective movie that will be remembered by me for a long, long time.  4 Stars	4.0	Shines brightly	2001-06-14	0	0	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3SFN7ECK78CEV	Undertaker	This film would be great if they had not made such a horrible editing mistake at the start of the film. As you see the main character's VW Bug driving to the hotel during the opening credits, there are several great helicopter shots. In one shot, you can see the shadow of the helicopter on the side of the mountain. It makes the film appear cheap and not well made. If they would fix this short shot, and edit that out, then the film would be wonderful. I understand this film is good, don't get me wrong, but little mistakes so obvious take away from the overall effect of the film, and make it look like no effort was put into production.	2.0	A good film, but there are some problems	2003-04-19	11	2	9

Now, being 24, it still creeps me out, but as a whole, it really isn't a frightening movie. Thats not to say it isn't a good one. It is. The 2 little girls in the hall...There is no scarier image. It has been ingrained in my mind ever since I first saw it. The tense atmosphere certainly helps the movie out and the climax is quite suspenseful. The true reason this movie is rated so high is because of Jack Nicholson. He created this perfectly creepy character and people still quote him years later. He is the reason the movie succeeds in being a horror/thriller. Great actors make great movies, well mostly. Obviously over 20 years old, the movie look dated and bland at times, but it still stands the test of time and that is the most important thing.

Jack Nickolson's character ""Jack Torrance"" - an aspiring writer suffering from writer's block takes up an odd winter job where he has to act as a keeper for the Overlook hotel during the peak winter months when it closes down as the roadways that lead to the hotel get blocked with snow during the winter. So Jack's job is to just stay at the hotel and do some small maintenance activities that require some manual intervention. So Jack moves in with his family (wife and son) to the hotel. The Hotel has a bad and spooky history of an earlier caretaker who was on the same assignment as Jack but ended up slaying his wife, 2 daughters and himself. It was explained as a spree of killing which was caused by the intense isolation caused by being cut of from the rest of the world staying at the hotel when access to the surrounding areas are blocked out by snow , and the depression that this isolation created for the caretaker. Jack then undergoes the same symptomps as he slowly falls into the madness that his own mind creates and ends up hunting down his wife and his child. This is a real frightning and freaky movie with non existent gore save for the few illusion seens when Jack and his child see the slain ghost people. This is a cult classic that sends shivers through your spine. Best to be seen all alone when no one is in the house and after dark. And the main fuel of the movie is the spooky acting of Jack Nicholson. You are genuinely scared of the character ""Jack Torrance"" that he plays. He brought such a realistic madness to the role.

I was 7 when my dad took me to see it in the theatre and I was scared absolutely sh!tless! I've seen it on tv, tape, and now restored DVD and its still the greatest scariest and best-acted horror movie ever. The acting is what sets this movie apart. Jack NIcholson is arguably our generation's greatest actor and here he gives a tremendous, energetic, and unforgettable performance. Nicholson as Jack Torrance is funny, crazy, and scary all at once! SOme of his scenes are so funny and scary you don't know whether to laugh out loud or scream! Nicholson would be enough to make this film great but what makes it a classic is all the supporting roles. Shelly Duvall is fantastic as Wendy, Jack's skinny meek wife who is confronted with a deranged husband and disturbed son in an abandoned snowbound hotel. Danny Lloyd(whatever happened to him?) is also solid as their 7 year old son Danny. Amazing performance by this talented little boy just adds believability and fear to the movie. Then we have the direction of Stanley Kubrick and the Overlook Hotel itself. The atmosphere and the music are absolutely terrifying. The music just chills your bones! THis movie is just perfect, absolutely perfect, I can't find a single fault with it, a true American horror masterpiece. The only controversy about this film has come from the author Stephen King who claims that Kubrick didn't do a faithful interpretation of his novel. THis is true to an extent. I've read King's book and it is good. But this is one case where the movie is BETTER than the book. Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; is a stunning ghost story with gore and violence thrown in. While King's novel is a psychological family drama. I think King should just be happy that Kubrick used his book to make this movie. It will stand as one of the truly classic and great American films of all time. What more could anyone ask for?	5.0	The Greatest Horror Movie Ever	2002-05-02	2	0	2
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	ASJ89T42CIUHU	V. Marshall	Between the spooky writing of Stephen King and the eerie direction of Stanley Kubrick it is hard to tell who made this movie scarier but it is a must for horror fans.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a writer in search of a quiet place to sit down and finish his novel so he interviews for a winter solstice as a caretaker for a remote resort in the Colorado mountains. In tow is his fragile wife (Shelley Duvall) and susceptible son (Danny Lloyd). The resort is filled with old haunted tales and legends so it becomes inevitable that something will be lurking behind those scary bushes! Jack settles into life as a writer but soon suffers from a bout of writer's block or is it something else? His frustration shows up in irritated bouts of abuse directed towards his family. His wife, Wendy, seems to slip lower and lower on the totem pole and becomes a shell of her former self as she tries her best to avoid angering her volatile husband with wicked eyebrows and an ever present smirk on his face. Meanwhile their son, Danny, spins about the hotel on a bigwheel and discovers all sorts of little secrets lurking in the rooms, a pair of spooky twin ghosts, blood soaked walls and a maze of manicured shrubs. Redrum, redrum.....beware!!There is always something unsettling about Stanley Kubrick's pictures and this film is pretty creepy. I must admit I never read Stephen King's novel but it is my understanding that Kubrick took it upon himself to change a few things resulting in a riff between the two artists. Regardless this film will remain a classic thriller despite succumbing to a recent remake. Jack Nicholson is downright terrifying in this film and Shelley Duvall becomes his squealing victim. Pulling some fantastic creepy performances out of nowhere are the young Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers who both manage to add a few eerie scenes to their bag of tricks.

I've read the book and I like it, I also saw the two part TV version that tried to follow the book dead on, I didn't like it as much.The movie does not try to be like the book, because Stanley Kubrick had a lot of different vision than the horrorful Stephen King.Apparently Stephen King didn't like KUBRICKS adaptation very much. Let me just say that certain things work in the book that don't work as well in the film version of this ghost story.For instance, the shrubs that come to life. Its kind of cheesy on the screen, theres no real way to do it. Replace the animal shaped shrubs with a maze of hedges, the center for an all out axe chase... now we are talking KUBRICK.What the movie lacks is the over all influence of the ghosts themselves. In the KUBRICK version we get more of the sense that the real demons are in Jacks head. He is still battling with his alcoholism, his relationship with his wife. He has too many weaknesses to deal with this incredible gift of THE SHINING.The story still follows the same structure. Danny, the boy, can see the future due to his gift. He can also see the past, which causes him to meet the two twin girls that were killed under similar circumstance.The Outlook Hotel feeds on winter caretakers. Danny understands why he see's such things, JACK does not. When the ghosts start channeling their shining in physical means, things atrt getting ugly all around, and Jack eventually cracks up and tries to axe up his family, so that they will ""never have to leave.""The maze is a highly effective symbol for the end of the movie, sure it compromises KINGS vision for KUBRICKS, but compromises well. Could you see a better ending for this movie than Jack Nicholson frozen on the ground with his axe, lost in the maze.The book ending is not described in so much detail, but rather through a photograph of Jack and his OUTLOOK Hotel friends dated 1928.This movie used to scare the crap out of me when I was real little, I've always been a huge fan of it.The twin girls, REDRUM, the elevator full of blood, the creepy music throughout.

Infact i feel like kubric did a good job of adding and adjusting parts of the plot to make the story more appealing on screen.  Several differences between the movie and book are 1) jack torrances charachter.  In the book, Jack Torrance , who is the caretaker of the hotel, is a family loving man who has done wrong in the past but is trying to change.  He interperets the actions in his life that he has done as nothing but natural reactions to ""wasp stings"" as he calls them, which are basically what society has done to him and has forced him to react badily upon.  Such as when he breaks his sons arm he feels like it wasnt really his fault he was forced to do it because of his sons bad behavior ""wasp stings"". In the book Jack Torrance is a family loving man with remorse for what he does.. however in the movie Jack Torrance is shown to be a lunatic with no real reasons for his anger and his bad temperment.  This change i felt was intelligently done by kubric.  Rather than having the hotel serve as the monster(and the possesed one), Kubric turns Jack Torrance's charachter into that.  The result of this is plenty of action and drama into a story whos book version failed miserably towards the ending. Also the ending of the movie story is different than the book story.  The shining is filled with plenty of action and excitement, and most of all the plot is done well.  I was not scared by the movie, however dont take that as a bad thing because i rarely if ever get scared watching a horror movie.  Jack Nicholson was absolutely brilliant in this movie and he really made it into the classic that it was.. I cant imagine anyone else playing his part.  I loved this movie the action and even some humor was brilliant.  The old woman tub scene was pretty close to any scare that i got in the movie.. she reminds me of the charachter zelda in pet semetary, but worse..if you can believe that.  Excellent movie 5 stars i give this.  Not the scariest horror movie ive ever seen (amityville is that) but its definelty the best horror movie that ive ever seen."	5.0	Nicholson makes the movie	2004-11-14	1	0	1
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	Kubrick took the original narrative and devised a story about the descent into madness vs. the original King emphasis on the ghost story and possession aspect. The recent television remake has its merits  (particularly in the subtle believable performance of Jack's gradual  &quot;possession&quot;), as does this theatrical version.King reportedly  doesn't care for Kubrick's cold, clinical approach to the horror story (but  that's to be expected--look at every film Kubrick made--there is a level of  detachment and clinical observation that reminds one that the film maker  --and audience--are always observers).While this isn't the best of  adaption of King's work, it is distinctly Kubrick's own version of the same  tale. What most fans of the film and book frequently miss is the subtle  (and not so subtle at times) satire of horror film cliches.The change  in the ending from King's novel works well--it re establishes  the sense of  unpredictability in the world that informs King's book. Certainly an  outstanding (if uneven )film, Kubrick manages to capture the essence of  King's themes while creating a film that distinctly belonged to Kubrick  himself.	4.0	Flawed classic from Kubrick	1999-06-30	0	0	0

Jack Nicholson plays one of his best performances as Jack Torrance, winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel along with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd), who has a special gift (The Shining) that can allow him to see things others can't and talk to people without moving his lips. In addition, a cook also has the Shining.The film proudly shows the style of the late Stanley Kubrick everywhere in the film: Scenes that take place in a bathroom (Three as a matter of fact), very clean rooms with white floors, three-way conflicts, long shots, up-close shots, and a story of dehumanization. It also shows Kubrick's sense of humor, which includes sarcasm (When Jack talks about Danny's knowledge of cannibalism ""...You see. It's okay. He saw it on the T.V!"") and black humor (A butler with a head injury holds up a glass and says  ""Wonderful Party, isn't it?""

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A34HYQ9BQZPE78	William Dorfer	"Among the seminal and influential horror films is ""The Shining"", which is an undisputed masterpiece, and one of the greatest psychological-horror movies of all time. Be it as lengthy as it is, ""The Shining"" is captivating in every second of its terrifying glory. I think one of the reasons ""The Shining"" is so influential is because throughout the entire movie, the characters are continually becoming developed. They grow and grow with each twist and turn of the series of events, and as the plot thickens, they still show signs of unfolding the layers of their persona.Another thing that makes ""The Shining"" such a great and influential horror movie is that it became one of the definitive movies where the location plays just as big a character role as the lead characters. In this case, The Overlook Hotel, which unfolds the dark and haunting mysteries of its twisted and murderous past, showcases that it plays just as big a role as Jack Nicholson or Shelly Duvall, both of whom are amazing actors here. The concept of the building playing a charater would later influence such great, modern-day psychological horror movies such as the great ""Session 9"".""The Shining"" is a movie that gives a good reputation to horror, because it's one of those movies that you really have to watch a few times to truly pick up on everything thrown in your direction. I honestly didn't fully understand everything until the fourth time I saw it, and by then, the movie went from being a puzzling masterpiece to an utterly terrifying masterpiece! Watching it in the right mood, one can see why this movie made #6 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.However terrifying this movie may be, it is undoubtedly brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and brilliantly directed. In addition to all of these positives, the scenery and atmosphere are incredible and quite surreal at times, making the movie even better. It's for these reasons that make it understandable why ""The Shining"" is one of those horror movies that even non-horror fans can really like.Another interesting thing about this movie is that it's not incredibly violent. Through the over two hours that this movie runs, there are only two kills. Although I do get a lot of enjoyment out of the gorier side of horror, I really like the fact that ""The Shining"" never became too graphic, because that would try to make the movie something that it's not. So bonus point for the movie staying true!Well, I know I built this movie up as much as a skyscraper, so I hope all readers out there really enjoy it! In short, if you're willing to watch a movie's that's quite long and progressive, but heightens in it's intensity and terror until the very end, ""The Shining"" will be a classic for you! Be sure not to hate on it until you've seen it a few times to better understand it, because if you're like me, by about the fourth time it'll have you terrified! Thanks for the time, and peace."	5.0	"I gotta say it... ""HEEEEERE'S JOHNNY!""."	2009-10-23	4	3	1

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2ASIT0JYIGHTA	William	"One cannot deny that Kubrick's vision of THE SHINING is brilliant.  The atmosphere is eeery, and while not entirely scary, can be difficult to watch late at night in the dark! The story focusses on a family who go up into the mountains to look after a hotel which is shutdown during the winter months.  Jack Nicholson is spot on as the father who is slowly going mad. Is it from the isolation, or is it from the evilness of the hotel itself?  Shelly Duvall plays his wife, and while I think they could have chosen someone better to play this role, she pulls it off adequately.The marketing of the movie itself has a life of its own.  In the UK, it got poor reviews from a test audience in 1980, so Kubrick edited the film for international audiences down to a 113 minute version (in a sense a forced ""Director's cut""). This version is what all DVD's outside of America now feature. At least Kubrick made the cuts, and not Warner Bros.Not having seen the longer 143 minute version, my concern is that the edited version does not answer many questions. I have read that the US version looks at the father's alcoholism, whereas the international version overlooks this.  One Aussie reviewer states that the edited version is ""nicely paced with more energy"". To me it just feels like something is missing from the international cut. It would have been nice of Warner Bros to add this additional 30 minutes as deleted scenes to the international DVD's.Aspect ratio - originally filmed in 1:66 format, and transferred to DVD as 1:33 as requested by Kubrick. Best viewed on a standard TV. Kubrick was not a fan of widescreen movies.Best advice to anyone considering buying this, is to grab the US DVD."	5.0	Eeery, a fine classic except for international version	2005-10-27	3	1	2

Well, perhaps 'try' isn't the right term because he accomplishes it. By wisely shifting attention from Danny and his 'special gift' and focusing on Jack going insane and terrorizing his family, Kubrick has made a powerful statement about what occurs when man is cut off from the world outside, made into an insular beast, and how he must lose his mind to escape. Jack Nicholson's slavering performance is a masterful tour-de-force, never have I had such fun watching a human being unravel! Stanley Kubrick's direction, as usual, is meticulous.  From his brilliant employment of the steadicam (those halls, the snowy banks outside) to his ability to make the horrific seem lovely ( the slow, gushing tidal waves of blood, his use of crystal clear, clean white light and grand sweeping shots of the hotel's interiors) the director has made what is probably the best looking horror film ever.  Forget the quibbles about length, plot focus and emphasis on Jack, just enjoy the scenery, the the mystiqe, the suspense and marvel at Mr. Kubrick's genius. A Classic. Highly Reccomended.	5.0	A Grand Experiment That Gets Better Every Time.	2001-06-12	0	0	0
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A1COQ2DOO1O9HD	Wing J. Flanagan	While I could grouse about the picture and sound quality of this DVD (as others have), I won't.  Purchased as part of the Stanley Kubrick Collection, The Shining has become a favorite disc.As the title of this review suggests, the best reason to hit the Add to Shopping Cart button on The Shining is the accompanying documentary &quot;The Making of the Shining&quot;.  Unlike the usual E!-type pabulum designed strictly to hype the film, this little 16mm gem was made by Stanley Kubrick's daughter as an exuberant tribute to what her dad did for a living. Her conversation with Jack Nicholson in a bathroom mirror - she holding the camera, he brushing his teeth - is a wonderful, insightful moment.  So is the footage of Kubrick directing Shelley Duvall, the cast rehearsing lines in the cavernous kitchen set, and the various interviews with cast members.  If you want to see what Stanley Kubrick was like at work, this, sadly, is your only chance.Like Barry Lyndon before it, The Shining seems to be, in part, an experiment. As Barry Lyndon shows us what a Kubrick costume drama would be like, so The Shining answers another eternal question - &quot;What would a Stanley Kubrick horror film be like?&quot;Oddly, the other Kubrick film it is most like is 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It has about the same running time; the same four-act construction; the sense of isolation; the long, wordless passages; a supernatural element; a homicidal maniac (HAL in the previous film, Jack in the latter); and a headlong rush into the unknown at the end (flying down corridors of light in 2001, running down corridors of a hedge maze in The Shining).  The clich&eacute; is true: in some ways it is a thinking-man's horror film.The Shining works on at least two levels. On the surface, we have the populist, iconic imagery - &quot;Heeeeers's Johnny!&quot;, the blood pouring from the elevator, and Tony the gravel-voiced finger-puppet of doom.  At the end, Kubrick even has fun with us by doing something we would not expect of him - the terrified wife sees visions of cobwebs and skeletons bathed in theatrical blue artificial moonlight. It's meant to be a grim joke about the genre. But like a great illusionist, Kubrick is misdirecting us, catching us off-gaurd with deft but cheap cinematic tricks so he can work on entirely deeper level. In this respect, The Shining owes more to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness than to Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th.This duality led to many critics to dismiss The Shining in their first reviews, as they responded to only the surface of the film.  It did not earn blockbuster dollars in its first theatrical run, either.  But then The Shining's second layer - the film the subconscious sees - began to take hold, and The Shining started to haunt our collective dreams.  In a quiet moment, the memory of Danny Torrance wheeling his tricycle through the corridors of the Overlook will bubble up, and bring a genuine chill we may not have even felt when first we saw it.  The Shining is most effective for its after-effect, rather than its initial catalogue of haunted-house theatrics.	5.0	Supplemental documentary alone worth the price	2000-12-02	2	2	0

I saw this as a kid before I had ever read the book and was in awe of how frightening and real everything seemed.  The woman from 237 is terrifying.

The performance of Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence is both haunting and mesmerizing, and is one that I will never forget. A truly horrifying film, it focuses a lot more on mental images and illusions for it's horror, and can be slow at times, as opposed to the fast paced, popping out at you horror films that you see so often.

Unfortunately, -as with most of King's flics, which are, generally-speaking, one-star debacles- the movie, ""The Shining"" isn't even half as good as the mediocre novel was.The Shining is flawed in about every conceivable way: With the exception of Jack Nicholson, the remaining actors are far more insipid and less interesting and solid as the book would have you imagine them being.  The movie omits some of the novel's best moments, and when the movie DOESN'T omit suspenseful moments from the book, it either shows it in a very cheesy, unsuspenseful manner and/or doesn't follow the book accurately.  (E.g., Jack Nicholson was supposed to be using a mallet to injure people, not an axe; the black man arrived at the hotel by way of a snowplow with a roof, but in the book it was a snowmobile, etc.)  All in all, The Shining ends up being the most boring, suspenseless, and one of the cheesiest Stephen King flics I've ever seen.The movie may be worth purchasing if you are an extremely die-hard King connoisseur, but if not then don't even consider this disastrous film."	2.0	Like most King movies, not even half as good as the book.	2002-01-28	9	4	5

Isn't there really anybody out there who agrees with me that ""The Shining"" is one big boring turkey? A flaw, dull, badly made movie with one Jack Nicholson in his most cheesy, routined and most over-acted performance of his entire carreer, and made by one Mr. Kubrick who, in my book, is the most overrated director ever to emerge on the surface of this earth?Chopping away with an axe, grinning into the camera and crying out ""Wooohaaah!"" with extended arms and grabbing fingers is not scary to me. The fact that all this is done by a man who once was a loving father and devoted husband, is, however. So, if this is the case, the main theme of a film which has somebody like this walking around and through the sets, must be the journey into madness this guy involuntarily must undergo. Questions arise: what makes a decent father and husband into a axe-yielding maniac, on the brink of madness and on the very moment of killing his beloved ones? What has triggered him, what are the hidden secrets that lie behind his thin facade of quietness?And in the case of ""The shining"", what is the role of the enormous Overlook Hotel in all this? Does it merely contribute to this journey by profiding giant empty hallways as chilly, desolate background? Or are there underlying secrets too, locked away behind doors that hang tightly in there hinges?The downward spiral, and for the audience to be a witness of it without having the chance to intervere, to put things straight, is what would make tension build to almost unbearable extremes.But for some reason Kubrick skips this very thing that gives the movie its potency and the possibility to become the next ""Repulsion"" or ""Rosemary's baby"". And talk about modern films which use these senses of paranoia within apartment bildings and the likes, take a look at the original ""Dark water"", the Japanese movie in which a damp, chilly appartment building has some terrifying secrets to reveal too, and does this so with much less obviousness and far more subtleness than ""The Shining"" - the result: real tension to be felt throughout the haunted place, and the haunted movie for that matter, and one scene filled with suspense and unease after another.I know all this, but apparently not many others.

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3K2UPVYXZMF0N	Yuli Martov	Many reviewers of this fabulous movie, who read the book first, throw around the adjectives &quot;Atrocious&quot;, and &quot;Disappointing&quot;, without even realizing that this is perhaps the scariest and most  terrifying movie that has ever been produced. I've read only one of Stephen  King's books(Skelaton Crew, a collection of short stories), and it was  certainly very creepy, but I don't think any film maker, could convey the  sort of terror that King's books produce. But Stanley Kubrick did perhaps  the best job that could concievably have been done.Contrary to what  others have said, I don't think Jack Nicholson's character looked psycho in  the beggining at all(Jack just looks that way naturally, just watch Batman,  One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest, or even Reds), I could see a degeneration  in his personality as the movie progressed(don't ask me how other people  didn't, it's an enigma!). Also, I found Shelley Duvall's character to be  comforting, as opposed to annoying, she just seemed like a normal person in  an abnormal world. If people found her annoying because she always  screamed, then they're boring and insipid hypocrites(when the Man or Woman  you marry, is about to hack you into pieces with an axe, I don't think you  would laugh or try to act likable!). The only problem with the movie, in my  opinion, is a scene with a bear suit, and a butler(I hate people that ruin  movies, so I won't go into specifics!). This is just a horribly terrifying  movie, with superb acting, an incredible location, and was directed by the  most prolific director to ever exist, Stanley Kubrick. You are depriving  yourself of potentially years of trauma, and nightmares by not watching  this movie(I would likely be a different person now if I didn't watch this  movie when I was very very young[I think I was six or seven!]), and if you  have watched this movie, then you almost certainly know what I'm talking  about!...	5.0	Absolutely Incredible	2000-08-29	14	12	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"In terms of classic horror films, this one is a must-watch for its imagery and quality acting.  However, don't expect to be satisfied with the plot no matter how many times you watch it.For a basic plot summary, ""The Shining"" tells the story of the Torrence family, who are assigned to ""house-sit"" a large hotel for the winter.  Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) begins to behave strangely, while his ""special"" son Danny (Danny Lloyd) and wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) must reap the consequences of that trip down insanity road for their father/husband.Easily the high point of this film is Nicholson's portrayal of a man slowly being driven completely insane.  With the facial expressions and extreme physical moods/movements that Nicholson brings to every role, he provides the most chilling scenes of the entire experience.The problem, however, is in trying to decipher the overall plot of the movie.  Director Stanley Kubrick basically just bombards viewers with all kinds of different themes, but then steps back in the end to let those viewers draw their own conclusions as to what is really going on.  Unfortunately, many of Kubrick's themes blatantly contradict each other, making it impossible to ever truly ""figure it out"".  Some elements are borrowed from the Stephen King novel of the same name, while others are original to the Kubrick adaptation.  The mix of the two is not conducive to an understandable plot.Overall, I have now viewed this movie three times, and enjoyed it a little less each time.  I always enjoy Nicholson's screen time, but just get too frustrated trying to piece the plot together.  In fact, a 3.5-star rating would more accurately portray my feelings towards the film.  In all honesty, I enjoyed the King novel more, and would recommend it (if not for the brilliant Nicholson) over this Kubrick version."	3.0	Appreciate Nicholson, But Don't Try To Dissect	2010-08-16	4	2	2

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	AJD9EA658HCFW	zck7592	"""The Shinning"" is a strange kind a film. After watching ""One flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" I had high expectations for ""The Shining"". I am also a fan of Jack Nicholson.""The Shinning"" is about writer Jack Torrance. He is a husband and father. One day he gets an offer at the Overlook Hotel being the winder caretaker. The reason he wants this job is because he is a writer and this hotel he will be working at is huge and isolated at night, so he can focus on his writing. While writing he would have frequent outburst when he was interrupted and having a hard time starting. His son has the gift of Extrasensory perception. Before they even move into the hotel, he has a vision of his father chasing him with an axe.""The Shinning"" has a very complex and confusing plot line that actually takes away from the rest of the film. I think part of the reason why the plot is so complex is because ""The Shinning"" is based off the novel by Stephen King.Overall, ""The Shinning"" has good acting by Jack Nicholson. He is the reason why the film earns 4 stars. The plot is also good, but I think this is the case where the book is better then the film. I say this because I'm sure that in the book Stephen King can do a lot more explaining of the story."	3.0	Very complex plot	2010-08-30	4	1	3
0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A3KTEWEI5R5CM	Zelgadis Greywyrs	I remember watching this with Amelia on HBO one night. She chased me around the room during the credits screaming &quot;REDRUM! REDRUM!&quot; but aside from that...this movie WILL get to you just like it did Amelia  and myself. Jack Nicholson WILL scare you. Shelley Duvall WILL... thorougly  annoy you...just don't expect it to be any better then the book. For  those of you rating it lower just because of this, you can't expect any  director, whether it be Kubrick or even HITCHCOCK, to make a movie better  then a novel written by the master of horror.	5.0	Play with us, Danny!

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A2YMFNXSPRVKEW	Z. Fu	The Shining is the best horror film ever!  It gives me the chill everytime.  Jack Nicholson's porformance is over the top.  The modern classical soundtrack is so creepy, building tension upto the end.  It is a pity that the director only allowed fullscreen version to be available on DVD.  This movie deserves better treatment than that.  Maybe we can get enough fans to rally for a widescreen version of it.  Hopefully, the studio will listen.	5.0	Widescreen Please !!!	2007-01-04	9	6	3

0790705141	The Shining [VHS]	A16KVJXN6QW7IK	Zy	A great remaster of a timeless classic. The remastering allows for breathtakingly beautiful wide shots of the natural surroundings. The hotel literally screams with vibrant color. The sound quality has been tinkered with and adds a new dimension to the already edgy tension of this thriller. Great extras and behind the scenes. Awesome buy.	5.0	classic tension, unforgettable fear	2011-08-21	3	2	1
