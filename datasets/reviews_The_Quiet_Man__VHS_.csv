6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3O7KHK3CJYU02	A Customer	If you want this DVD, get the VHS video. It is the same thing. Why they did not use widescreen, I do not know. The Irish scenery alone screams for widescreen. Production value is the same as the VHS. And the beautiful  soundtrack is in mono. There is no gain to go to DVD. It gets 2 stars  because of the two stars, no other reason.	2.0	Disappointing for DVD	1999-12-27	16	9	7

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3DE6AOGI4LY03	Agooddane	I'm not going to bang on about the movie..  It is great and speaks for itself.  But let's talk about the blu ray edition.  Amazing transfer quality of this movie left my amazed.  The definition is sharp and clear, and the colour, while appearing super-bright in the first few minutes due to memories of this movie viewed on TV over the years, soon becomes comfortable.  Watch the Extra feature doco for a bit of interesting history, but also to compare the old image quality.  It's a great classic movie, and it has now received the care it deserves to bring it to a new audience.	5.0	Review of blu ray edition - brilliant!	2013-12-06	1	1	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2JCC3T8LT6PGU	A Hatcher	Great picture BUT, Olive Films, which  produced this blue-ray version of the QUIET MAN, has NO regard for the hearing impaired or hard of hearing in that they fail to have closed caption capabilities. I have viewed many Olive Film movies and never do they consider the good people having hearing problems. Would not recommend it for that reason alone.	2.0	The Quiet Man  not for the Hearing Impaired.	2013-08-28	5	4	1
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A16MHYWQ23GPHF	ajwa	It took sixty years but at last we have a beautifully presented copy of one of hollywoods best films.For years i have wasted money hoping to get a good print of this film,now thanks to olive films my quest has ended, from the wonderful cover art to the print itself this release is pretty near perfection .One of the delights of the film is the setting,now perfectly crisp and clear,you can see all the detail in glorious colour.Throw out all those other mediocre copies of this classic and enjoy this..you might however like to keep the disc that has the maureen ohara commentary,picture is terrible but she is great!	5.0	at last ,at last!!	2013-02-04	1	1	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3CSRP3P4U9HI	Alan R. Holyoak	It's amazing to me that John Wayne did what I would consider his best work not in westerns or  war movies, but in this romantic comedy set in Ireland.A yank former-boxer, John Wayne, meets  and is greatly impressed by the beautiful Irish country girl, Maureen  O'Hara, but he simply doesn't understand the traditional rules of courtship  and marriage in Ireland in the early 1900s.The casting is superb, and  the supporting actors make the whole thing come together.  O'Hara's  on-screen brother is a good match for Wayne during their monumental  scuffle.  There's nothing quite like a good old knock down drag out  Hollywood enhanced fist fight is there? And all for love, face, and  honor.Top-notch entertainment. An immensely watchable movie that  husbands, wives, and children can enjoy.5 stars all the way.Alan  Holyoak	5.0	John Wayne at his best!	2000-06-30	12	12	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2QASAMGT1UYZ3	Alexis_Ray	"*****5 stars for the filmHaunted by an incident that happened in the ring, American boxer Sean Thornton (John Wayne) returns to his Irish birthplace, seeking only his roots and a quiet, peaceful life.He soon falls in love with the beautiful, tempestuous Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara). She is equally taken with him, but won't marry without the consent of her stubborn, blustering brother, Will (Victor McLaglen), who disapproves the match.With the help of a well-intentioned scheme arranged by their friends, Mary Kate gets her brother's permission and Sean and she wed. Relationships spoil soon after, however, when Will refuses to pay the rightful dowry. Sean doesn't care, but Mary Kate is outraged and wants Sean to have it out with Will.Time and again Sean backs down - determined not to use his fists - his inner tension building the whole while. But eventually he will have to decide between losing his wife's love and respect and facing his greatest fear.This was an important and personal project for John Ford (whose real name was Sean O'Feeney). That his heart and those of his cast members were in what they were doing shows through. The fact that much of the film was shot on location in Ireland (on location shoots were somewhat unusual at the time) also adds an authentic flavor.Barry Fitzgerald was at his comedic best here, and Ward Bond's performance as a priest has several simply unforgettable moments.The Quiet Man is a charming classic and among Ford's best (in fact, it won him an Oscar for Best Director). It's funny, romantic, and always entertaining. It also features an exuberant score (courtesy of Victor Young) and one of the longest and most memorable knock-down, drag-out fights ever committed to film.-DVD-Two different editions of this DVD have been released with almostidentical packaging. Be careful which one you buy! (I wish I'd known this).""John Wayne Collection"" edition (*1 star)This is the one I bought (ISBN 0-7820-1057-1, ASIN: B00000I1KV).

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AULVPU9J2YQJL	Amazon Customer	"For those who don't really dig John Wayne's ""shoot-em-up"" westerns, this is a refreshing drama which is set in Ireland.  The Irish charm of scenery and culture is breath-taking and touching.  Wayne plays a son of an Irish immigrant turned prize-fighter, who after accidentally killing a man in the boxing ring, gives up the fight-game and retires to his beloved birthplace which was evidently immortalized by his mother's continued remembrances of ""the old country"".  Maureen O'Hara plays the Irish lass who captures his heart and is just as tough and stubborn as he is.  They are a perfect match of which the entire village is in hearty agreement - except her brother.Feminists won't like this movie by director John Ford as there is old-world male dominance prevalent in this movie.  The fight scene at the end is probably the fist-fight of all time which ""wallers-down"" most of the countryside.  The ""Fighting Irish"" are reputed to love a good fist fight and here it is shown to be true by the fact that almost everyone in the village is at the event and even people from the surrounding villages are enroute by the bus-loads.Colorful characters, old-world charm, splendid and uplifting Irish folk songs, a great supporting cast, and romance decorate this 1952 favorite of mine.  Watch closely for the guy playing the accordion in the pub.  He is Ken Curtis who played, Festus, on the western TV Series, Gunsmoke.  He also sang with the Sons of the Pioneers way, way, back when - but he isn't even in the credits.Want to be taken back to yesteryear?  This is it - and you'll love it -- if you're not a feminist.I have had no problems with this DVD.  I'm sorry about the guy who got a dud.  He should have exchanged it."	5.0	John Wayne with a heart	2007-08-17	2	1	1
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2ATIIXNM1UKF4	Amazon Customer	This and Robin Hood were two of the very few films I've had an irrational desire to actually own rather than simply rent. I read the earlier reviews with care, and thought I was getting a good copy, but this Collector's Edition seems to have been the one copied from a poor VHS tape.

I have been waiting for the blu-ray forever, but because they were too cheap to add subtitles I will not buy it no matter how good the picture quality is. Companies like Olive Films who discriminate against the hard of hearing & the deaf should be put out of business. This might sound harsh, but more & more it is becoming hard to find good movies & TV series that have caption or subtitles added.

There's been more than enough praise given to this movie, I just wanted to comment on the newly released blu-ray edition. After watching the blu-ray version and then comparing it to the Artisian dvd release, it makes you realize how bad the Artisian release really was visually. This movie now ""jumps"" off the screen with it's brilliant colors and detail. You can now clearly see such details as telephone wires, the nice tweed material of the Duke's jacket, rain drops on the faces of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, print in the newspaper, and the lines on the character's faces. A job well done by Olive. Unfortunately there aren't any new extras and even one seemed to get dropped all together (Maureen O'Hara interview). My only gripe is that I wish they could've come up with some new extra bonus material. A definte worth while upgrade of the movie.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2U4UOBD0705V4	"AndrewCF ""Andy"""	Olive Films' release of John Ford's masterpiece, The Quiet Man, is a qualified success.  In comparison to the previous DVD release, there is nothing so annoying as to hamper anyone's enjoyment of the film.  In the previous version we had to deal with maddening scratches, reel change marks, and washed-out Technicolor.  If Technicolor is washed out in certain movies, it's done for aesthetic reasons (The Godfather, for example).  This new release displays on the whole brighter and more saturated color; it is unfortunate that the saturation comes at the cost of graininess, which is not a by-product of classic Technicolor processing.  While skies still look more pastel than deep blue, the improvement on the last version is palpable.  Of course, the &#34;risks&#34; of outdoor and/or location shooting include the capricious nature of the climate; Ireland is not immune to fogs, clouds, and rain. In such conditions, matching shots are especially difficult.  Take the horserace in this films, where wind and clouds threaten to limit takes and matching shots.  In the previous DVD, this scene is a nightmare: dark and light, sunny and cloudy. Carefully timed, the restorer can help mitigate extremes, but none of that is evident in the previous version.  Of course, for crucial scenes, Ford had to rely on matching the outdoor light in the studio, where he has optimum control.  One must remember that remastering is not the same thing as restoring.  A company like Criterion, working with universities and other organizations, must invest time and funding to accomplish the task of recreating the vision closest to the filmmakers.'  But I judge this present version a success, since it allows the view to enjoy the film without distractions.	5.0	Not perfection but closer	2013-04-27	1	1	0

In any case, I've owned the VHS, Collectors Edition and now the Blu Ray.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A38A18CWUATGT7	A Reader	"This review applies to the ""Collector's Edition DVD"": Four+ stars for the movie, which - while it has little to do with the Ireland of history, has much to do with the Ireland of fable. John Ford and his remarkable cast capture the spirit of that latter Ireland and spread it across the screen. Wayne and O'Hara are close to perfect, and the star-studded cast play their fabled Ireland beautifully. About the only quibble I have with the movie itself is that during the great donnybrook the film was speeded up to make the action faster, and it's pretty obvious.A star or so off for the DVD transfer, where the green and red saturation are a bit high, and a number of single-frame artifacts  were left in. The first can be controlled with a bit of video adjustment, and the second isn't all that distracting - but why not do it right?I'd stand in line for a newly-mastered DVD."	3.0	An Irish fable well told	2006-08-29	5	4	1

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1WKD13MH7ODIW	"A. Silverman ""BooksDealer eselling stuff sinc..."	Blarney and bliss, mixed in equal proportions. John Wayne plays an American boxer who returns to the Emerald Isle, his native land. What he finds there is a fiery prospective spouse (Maureen O'Hara) and a country greener than any Ireland seen before or since--it's no surprise The Quiet Man won an Oscar for cinematography. It also won an Oscar for John Ford's direction, his fourth such award. The film was a deeply personal project for Ford (whose birth name was Sean Aloysius O'Fearna), and he lavished all of his affection for the Irish landscape and Irish people on this film. He also stages perhaps the greatest donnybrook in the history of movies, an epic fistfight between Wayne and the truculent Victor McLaglen--that's Ford's brother, Francis, as the elderly man on his deathbed who miraculously revives when he hears word of the dustup. Barry Fitzgerald, the original Irish elf, gets the movie's biggest laugh when he walks into the newlyweds' bedroom the morning after their wedding, and spots a broken bed. The look on his face says everything. The Quiet Man isn't the real Ireland, but as a delicious never-never land of Ford's imagination, it will do very nicely.	5.0	Big John quiet? well, when you're a great actor...	2003-03-13	1	1	0

The DVD has brighter colors and this Blu-ray rendering has subdued that.  This film used the Technicolor process and you can see that better on the DVD.  Seeing Maureen O'Hara and the Irish countryside in full-blown color is just wonderful on the DVD!  Although the Blu-ray picture was very clear and clean . . .

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A16EEN6D0XQJV4	Ave Orois Fernandez	"The Quiet Man is a delightful film, one of these cases where everything clicks -the cast, the music, the cinematography...- resulting in a truly breathtaking masterpiece. But that's a widely known statement, and there are lots of well written reviews around already. What a prospective buyer of this DVD most probably wants to know is: how good the DVD transfer is?Well, I would answer this using a single word which would accurately express what you will find if you buy this one -in fact, I *UTTERED* that very word shortly after I slipped this DVD inside the player and pressed the play button- but I'm afraid this review would be banned if I did so. So, to make a short story long, I'll say that the DVD transfer is pitiful. Terrible. It looks like if they had used some (poor) VHS tape as a master and fiddled with the color sliders, so what you finally have is a blurry picture with annoying, garish colours which results in a completely disappointing and shameful viewing experience, to say the least. I'll have to treasure my VHS copy which -sad but true- has got far more decent colour and definition.It's a pity that a classic of this calibre had been mistreated this way -they even packed it lavishly with a nice carton frame with an engraved ""Collector's Edition DVD"" silver badge which completes the mockery. I expected far more from Artisan, as I had previously bought their excellent DVD edition of ""High Noon"", with razor sharp picture, THX certification and all the bells and whistles. So I feel completely cheated and worried, not just because of the 17'99 bucks down the drain, but, most of all, for the fact that once a film has been released on DVD, chances that it'd be released again soon, in a *PROPER* condition, become scarcer.By the way, permit me a brief remark about the fact of how surprisingly poor are DVD versions of John Ford pictures: exception made for three excellent DVDs -The Searchers (Warner), The Man who Shot Liberty Valance (Paramount), and How Green was My Valley(Fox)- the rest of John Ford's filmography on DVD has been, as far as I know, released in dreadful condition regarding image and sound. Which is hard to believe, when it comes to one of the most relevant directors in the History of Filmmaking. Let's hope things begin to change soon and we could enjoy his films, for once and all, in their full glory."	1.0	Wonderful Film, Disappointing DVD	2003-09-09	29	26	3

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	ALR35EFI69S5R	"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman"""	In what was easily John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara's single best performances, the spellbinding story set in the midst of Ireland's breath-taking rural culture is a perpetual favorite film for me. Hardly a year goes by that I don't pull it down from the shelf to enjoy on a stormy day such as this to marvel over Miss O'Hara's astonishing beauty and the endless charm of the characters woven so memorably by Director John Ford. What is most surprising is Ford's sensitive and knowing handling of the cross-cultural misunderstandings that provide the grist of the comedy of well-intentioned errors that propel the star-crossed lovers throughout the breadth of the movie.We viewers are quickly caught up in all this sentimental nonsense as well, and seem content to wallow in the obvious silliness and contrived situations these misunderstanding throws into in the characters' way. Yet, for all the stereotypical and all-too romanticized treatments of both bucolic ignorance, on the one hand, and world-weary sophistication, on the other, one finally surrenders to a work of art unfolding on the celluloid screen, however unlikely or improbable. Like Ford's westerns, the characters on the screen represent cultural icons, and often act like such. Yet here we see much more openness, tenderness, and honest human emotion than in any of Ford/Wayne's other joint projects.As it is, when I remember the Duke, it is in the character in this movie that I think of him as having his finest and truest cinematic moments, acting like a twentieth century man forced by personality and circumstances into facing both his inner demons and his hopes for the future as captured in a dazzling and daunting redhead (O'Hara), a cinematic presence who was every inch his match. Nowhere else, not even in &quot;Stagecoach&quot; or &quot;True Grit&quot;, is Wayne quite so good or quite so believable.  Add this to some unforgettable characterization and the breath-taking beauty of a long-ago Irish landscape, and you have a classic film! As such, this is movie magic that I heartily recommend. Enjoy!	4.0	Wonderful Classic Fim by John Ford!	2001-03-06	22	20	2

This is one of the best movies John Ford and John Wayne did but the poor reproduction is criminal.  Any 13 year old with a computer could have done a better job.  I agree with the the other posters that the poor quality makes it almost unwatchable.  If you are considering buying it hold off until someone does a better job of reproduction.  Ford insisted that Republic allow him to use Technicolor for the colour as opposed to their own colour process so that the film could be of the highest quality.

This quiet man turns out to be returning to his home after a hard life in America. There he purchases his old home to the shegrim of the neighbor Red Will Danaher (Victor McLagen), who covets the house himself. We learn a few Irish no-nos; such as you do not play patty fingers with the holy water. I will not go through the whole story as it is fun to watch it unfold. However there is a good example of horse sense as the horse knows to stop at the pub for Michaeleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) whom has a very dry throat.The scenery gives the story a run for its money.Note the stars are always for content as different media is mixed in the reviews.	5.0	Rural Irish life in the 1920s	2005-08-17	3	3	0

On a lake cruise we enjoyed the music of a bit player, Martin (in the movie he's playing the accordion in the bar scene), so naturally we had to see the movie. I am not a big fan of John Wayne, but he was good in this role. Having learned so  much about the (tragic) history of Ireland, especially in the 19th & early 20th centuries, we were able to appreciate much more the often subtle political references. And since many of the characters could have been people we had just recently met, we felt we were reliving part of our marvelous tour.btw, the tape arrived very quickly and was in good shape, as advertised.	5.0	Great viewing after an Ireland trip	2012-11-11	0	0	0

They scammed the public twice with this one. ""Remastered"" is not an apt term. They look like they were copied with a cheap cell phone.

Boxer Wayne returns to Ireland after killing a man in the ring and seeks a new life of tranquility. But he meets the beautiful O'Hara; they fall in love (some of the most romantic scenes on film are when Wayne and O'Hara are on screen together) and decide to marry. But because of a property dispute, her brother Will (Victor McLaglen) refuses to give her her dowry, and without it she feels unworthy of Wayne. He doesn't see the importance of it, though to her it's what puts her on an equal footing with him (she's a ""modern woman"" after all); she even accuses him of being a coward for not fighting her brother to get it. This, of course, moves Wayne to action, and the fight scene between Wayne and McLaglen is a highlight of the movie.This is entertainment with a capital E, and it's Ford at his best. We're not thrown any surprises along the way, and Ford likes his stereotypes, but what we are offered is just so exquisite we can't help but enjoy the whole shebang. The photography is fabulous. One of Hollywood's best romantic comedies. Definitely worth a watch."	5.0	"""Impetuous! Homeric!"""	2006-01-30	4	4	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A202OG34SCZVK4	"Brad Butler ""Brad Bulter"""	"What can one say about one the best movies ever directed by the best director in the history of Hollywood, John Ford.  A movie 15 years in the making, turned down by all the idiots at the major studios in the mid-to late 1940s, this movie was only made because of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara's efforts and it was a major hit.  It remains a John Ford classic and one of the funniest, most romantic and endearing movies of all time.Remember what Orson Welles said when asked about his favorite movie directors: ""I studied under that masters, that would be John Ford, John Ford and, Oh, Yes, John Ford.""  This amazing Irishman painted pictures with every shot and rode his actors hard to get the best out of them.  That being said, the DVD transfer was done rather poorly, what a shame."	5.0	The Quiet Man is Absolute Classic in Every Sense of the Word	2009-03-21	1	1	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3VZTEW59MKK7J	Brendon	This is a fine John Wayne/John Ford movie (but not their best). Its a good old fashioned comedy filled with colorful characters and very old timey values (many could get offended at the stereotypes and almost abusive nature of Waynes character in such a lighthearted film). I have to imagine that since this was filmed in Technicolor, back in the day the prints must have looked spectacularly beautiful (it won an Oscar for its cinematography and John Ford won an Oscar for directing). However, this dvd transfer is by far the absolute worst transfer for any major motion picture. This appears to be the same quality as an old second generation videotape. This is not hyperbole, I have literally never seen a worse transfer of any major motion picture from any age. This is an absolute travesty considering its importance in cinema history. I hope for the sake of the film that Artisan or another company creates a new transfer (hopefully on Bluray as well).Overall: Classic movie if you're into it, good special features, awful transfer.	1.0	Good Movie, Terrible Terrible DVD Transfer	2009-07-31	5	4	1
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A25UZ7MA72SMKM	Brent Butler	This was John Wayne's best true romantic comedy, and it is one of the best films of all times.The cinematography is at times breathtaking. The story is warm and funny. Best of all, you get a real sense of belonging to the small Irish town in which the film is set. You'll feel the community so fully that you'll be sorry when the film is over and you have to return to your own.John Ford and John Wayne's favorite entourage cast is assembled and does fine work in the roles of the families and townspeople involved in the story.Maureen O'Hara is as fiery as ever, and in her prime of being the great beauty she was (and is).If you've never seen this film, you owe it to yourself. This is one of the few films that I always watch anytime it happens to come on, and always will.	5.0	A must see classic	2010-06-14	2	2	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1SF59X4FDUGQG	Bret Alexandre	The Quiet Man is once of my favorite movies of all time and I was waiting and hoping for Blu-Ray with captions. Once this finally became available on Blu-Ray I ordered it as soon as I found out.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!  When I got it home, I found it would NOT work in either my Toshiba BR player, OR in the BR player in my computer!!  What the heck is up with that ?!?  I never did get a chance to find out if it was captioned or SDH or not. The case did not say it was, so I suspect not.All in All, this was a real disappointment to me! Now I have to wait and wait again, hoping someone will release this execellent movie in Blu-Ray the WORKS, AND has either captions or SDH for hearing impaired individuals such as myself.	2.0	Not what I was hoping for.	2013-04-19	1	0	1

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	ACC1SLND21RI6	Breyel	"When Director John Ford (whose real name was Sean O'Feeney) first proposed that a film be adapted from the book ""The Quiet Man"", studio heads in the 1940's dismissed it as a ""simple little Irish story"" that would be a financial bomb at the box office.Ford undoubtedly envisioned the opposite. He pictured lush landscapes of the emerald isle, peppered with the culture and customs of the Irish -- their religious convictions, their language, their pubs, their music, their blarney. He saw a sentimental story of an Irish-American prize fighter returning to the land of his birth, wishing to escape a past tragedy in the ring, falling in love and marrying a local lass, only to have his hope of a blissful life nearly thwarted by a pugnacious brother-in-law. Foremost of all, he had the good sense to assemble a formidable cast of actors, including John Wayne as Sean 'Trooper' Thorton, Maureen O'Hara as Mary Kate Danaher, Victor McLaglen as Will Red Danaher , Ward Bond as Father Lonigan (narrator of the story) and Barry Fitzgerald as Michaeleen Flynn. Idealistic? Perhaps, but what a grand film it is!One cannot help but admire John Ford's genius. Many of the scenes are technically and visually arresting for a film made in 1951. Follow the camera as it pans across the Irish coastline when the local derby is underway. Catch the simmering sensuality Wayne and O'Hara feel for one another as they embrace, kiss and the rain pours down, drenching Wayne's translucent silk shirt. Watch O'Hara chat up Ward Bond in Gaelic while he stands knee deep in a glistening pond fly-fishing. Join the town's folk as Wayne takes O'Hara in tow at the train station and drags her across the land, kicking and swinging. See the rollicking donnybrook as McLaglen and Wayne duke it out across the countryside. Scenes like these take hold of the senses and fire the imagination. The viewer believes he is in Ireland. And when the cast curtsey and wave adieu at the end of the film, we are lured once more into believing the story and the people are genuine.Ford knew how to pluck the heartstrings of an audience. And this 2-DVD collector's edition reveals how he accomplished this feat. In addition to his Oscar-winning movie, a number of special segments delve into the history and making of ""The Quiet Man"". Leonard Maltin explores the origin of the ""The Quiet Man"", how Ford struggled for years to get the film made with studio bosses, then ended up at Republic Pictures on the condition he make the western ""Rio Grande"" to cover any financial loss incurred from ""The Quiet Man"". An archived interview with Wayne and Ford underscores their mutual respect and friendship. Interviews with Maureen O'Hara, Andrew V. McLaglen (son of Victor McLaglen) and Patrick Wayne are equally insightful and nostalgic. Biographies and movie credits of the cast are included as well in this DVD set.I'd give ""The Quiet Man"" ten stars if I could. It's GREAT! Get it. It'll warm your heart and bring a smile to your face."	5.0	Guaranteed to warm the heart and bring a smile.	2005-09-13	2	2	0

I always thougth of John Wayne as a cowboy, but this movie breaks that mold.  One of the first movies ever to be filmed on location, The Quiet Man offers the story of tempestuous lovers, a man with a past, and the beauty of the Emerald Isle.  Complete with one of the greatest donnybrooks ever conceived, let alone filmed, the Quiet Man appeals to both genders and all ages.It does appear slightly dated, frankly, in the treatment of women, but that in no way detracts from the magic of the film.

Do you really need a blue ray copy if you already own the DVD copy?  No, but like I said this is one of my favorite movies.  Is it worth it?  It was for me, the colors are great, and you almost feel like you are in Ireland, especially the rainstorm scene.  Are the differences that significant? Not really, but they are better.  Basically, just depends on whether you feel like spending some more money.  I wouldn't do it for most movies, but the Quiet Man is different.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3N8RZSXKN1OR2	Chrijeff	"Director John Ford (born Sean Aloysius O'Feeney) here salutes his parents' native land with the help of his best-known actor and several members of his famous ""stock company.""  Sean Thornton (John Wayne), reared in Pittsburgh but born in the cottage called White o'Morn in Innisfree, returns to the land of his birth intending to buy the place and spend his life there.  On his first glimpse of Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), he is immediately smitten.  The cottage has been acquired by the dignified and well-to-do widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick), who is reluctant to sell to him at first, but when Mary Kate's older brother, ""Squire"" Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), expresses a rather presumptuous interest in it (and her), she consents, earning Thornton Danaher's enmity and making courtship all but impossible (""without her brother's consent she couldn't and wouldn't"").  So the parish priest Father Lonergan (Ward Bond), the Anglican rector Mr. Playfair (Arthur Shields), and the local matchmaker, bookmaker, go-between, and jaunting-car owner Michaeleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) enter into a conspiracy to convince Danaher that the widow would take him in a minute if only there weren't another woman in his house.  It succeeds long enough for Sean and Mary Kate to get married, but trouble follows over her dowry--an assortment of household goods and some 350 pounds in gold coin.  And though the community expects that Sean will fight his brother-in-law over the issue, Sean is reluctant: he has a secret that preys on his mind.With a brilliant cast (the accomplished scene-stealer Fitzgerald, 64 years old, is still up to his longtime standard, and Bond takes a break from his usual rough-and-tough image to do a convincing turn as a priest, while Sean McClory (as Owen Glynn) and Charles B. Fitzsimons (as Hugh Forbes) appear as a pair of reformed I.R.A. fighters and Jack MacGowran as Danaher's flunky Feeney), several traditional Irish songs (""The Wild Colonial Boy,"" ""Mush Mush Mush Tura-Li-Addy""), beautiful location photography (and a few unfortunately recognizable process shots), a generous measure of humor of the old-fashioned wry and subtle kind, and an attractive main couple (Wayne and O'Hara also teamed inJohn Wayne-Rio Grande,McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition), andBig Jake), this is a story for the Irish in all of us, and especially suitable for viewing around St. Patrick's Day.  It's also a story about culture clash, about mutual adjustments to an unfamiliar culture as well as to the state of marriage, about arrogance and friendship and courage, and about how a man can surprise himself with both his own restraint and his tipping point."	5.0	A love song to the Emerald Isle	2009-12-04	2	2	0

Wayne IS the ""Quiet Man"". He moves back to the family home in Ireland after a personal crisis happens to him in the States. He meets his ""Spinster"" neighbor, played by O'Hara, almost as soon as his feet hit Irish soil......and he's smitten. The Old Word ways of the community and the ""red head"" personality of O'Hara make a heart warming story.This is the favorite movie in our house. Wayne is my husband and he says I'm O'Hara.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AG89YXJSTWGEE	Classic Collecter	This is the 3rd Quiet Man purchase i have made because of lousy transfers and it will be my last.This 60th Aniversary Special Edition is a Heart Breaker to. The transfer was ok, the colors and the skin tones real,the fabric on the clothes even looked perfect and then the bottom fell out.Right after John Wayne and Maureen O'hara tie the knot the scene where Victor McLaglen discovers he was dupedwas cut along with the punch that starts the whole thing and when they go to his cottage through the Duke in his sleepingbag the next morning. All that was eliminated and to top it off it skips where the splice was made to continue the movie.Do not waste you're money on this product unless you enjoy being ripped of. I am contacting Maureen O'hara who is stillalive and am going to initiate public outrage that this is being done to us. If this is not corrected this timeless classic willgo the way of the &#34;DODO&#34; Bird and dissapear, we the consumer can only take so much and that's it.	1.0	They Did it Again	2014-01-08	3	0	3
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A15IN5H4IATSHQ	Classic film buff	"Even though it's too late to post this for Saint Patrick's Day, ""The Quiet Man"" is a joyous, exuberant film to view any day of the year, and you don't have to be Irish to enjoy it, although if you're first generation Irish American as I am, and/or have visited Ireland at least once, you will have a deeper appreciation of it!  For sentimental reasons I do make it a point to view this film every St. Patrick's Day to honor the memory of my late father, who was Irish born, this was his favorite film, many a time he watched it, first whenever it was on regular television, and then on video when the VCR came into existence, he just loved it!Retired American boxer, Sean Thornton (John Wayne), has returned to live in the small town of Innisfree, Ireland, where he was born.  Although he made a good living as a boxer, he accidently killed another man in the ring, and vowed never to fight again.  He purchases back the family homestead from the wealthy Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick) incurring the enmity of the strapping well to do landowner Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) who wanted the property for himself.  Spitefully, Will refuses to let Sean court his beautiful, spirited sister Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara) despite the fact they are both in love, and Mary Kate won't wed without her brother's approval.  Will is tricked to into giving his consent by a conspiracy between the matchmaker Michaeleen Flynn, (Barry Fitzgerald), the parish priest Father Lonergan (Ward Bond) and the Protestant vicar Reverend Playfair (Arthur Shields) and his wife Elizabeth (Eileen Crowe), without Sean or Mary Kate's knowledge, and the courtship and the marriage duly take place.  However at the wedding reception Will learns the truth and blames the innocent Sean for the deception.  Enraged he refuses to give Mary Kate her dowry of 350 Irish pounds, which Mary Kate feels is rightfully hers, and she tells Sean to demand it from Will.  Sean doesn't understand the whole custom of the dowry, and it's significance to Mary Kate, and refuses to do so out of pride.  This causes a serious rift between Mary Kate and he that can only be resolved when he confronts and fights Will for the money even though Sean had pledged never to fight again.The above synopsis sounds fairly somber, and while the subject matter is serious director John Ford and screenwriter Frank Nugent make sure that there is plenty of humor and laughter to leaven it out.John Wayne was one of the cinema's most underrated actors; he was much more accomplished than he was given credit in his lifetime.  Amidst all his strong portrayals in ""Stagecoach"", ""Red River"" and ""The Searchers"", Sean Thornton stands out as his finest achievement.  Sean is a man of many parts and Wayne captures them all.  Although Sean is robust, virile, and athletic, Wayne is not afraid to show Sean's sensitive, tender side as well, reveal the touch of the poet that sometimes colors his speech.  This is a man comfortable in his own masculinity, who can appreciate beauty, he plants roses outside his cottage, is not afraid to let his wife drive the horse and cart that he has given her.  There is a streak of inherent melancholy in Sean that Wayne suggests; he has to live with the fact that even though it was unintentional, he is responsible for another man's death.  John Wayne truly does plumb the depths of this conflicted man, and stretch himself as an actor.  He absolutely deserved the Oscar for this performance rather than ""True Grit"".  Astonishingly, he wasn't even nominated, yet another Oscar injustice.The entrance of Maureen O'Hara as Mary Kate is one of the most enchanting, beguiling introductions in movie history.  A barking sheepdog is herding a flock of sheep in a verdant, tree lined field, suddenly there is a magical glissando on harp strings, and Mary Kate appears, barefoot, clad in vivid blue and red, her burnished, titian tresses tumbling down her back, holding a staff in her hand as she follows behind, the sun hits her, giving the illusion as if she's lit from within.  She is the embodiment of an ancient Celtic queen from Irish mythology, Maeve or Isolde perhaps?  Sean, at first glimpse is dazzled; he asks Michaeleen rhetorically, ""Is that real?  She couldn't be!""  This was my father's favorite scene, he had owned sheep and tended them in Ireland, and he loved the combination of Maureen O'Hara, whom he adored and the flock.  Ms. O'Hara's Mary Kay is fiery and forthright; tart tongued when needed, (the title is one of her memorable stingers!) with a strong, decided character.  In fact she is a liberated woman, she treats men as equals and will settle for nothing less in return, she meets Sean's passion with her own.  In Ms. O'Hara's hands Mary Kate is gorgeous and glorious, an individual both men and woman can like and admire.  Like Wayne, this is her best performance, and irritatingly like Wayne was not Oscar nominated, what were they thinking that year?I'd like to pay a quick tribute to the charismatic pairing of Wayne and O'Hara, they both bring out the excellence in the other, perfectly designed by nature, with a erotic magnetism, the sparks fly when they're together.  They rightfully belong in the pantheon of classic screen couples such as Tracy and Hepburn, Powell and Loy and Bogart and Bacall.As for the rest of the cast, they are unqualifiedly marvelous one and all!  Leading the list Victor McLaglen as the bull headed Will Danaher, the only cast member to be Oscar nominated, and Barry Fitzgerald as Michaeleen Flynn, who as usual comes perilously close to stealing every scene that he's in.  A round of applause as well to Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, Arthur Shields, Eileen Crowe and Francis Ford.  Lastly, I want to give a special mention to Jack MacGowran as Feeney, Will's elfin assistant and ""yes"" man, who delivers perfectly two of the funniest lines in the film!This film was director John Ford pet project, it took him seven years to bring it to fruition, but it was worth the wait.  It's his own love letter to his Irish ancestry; he pulls out all the stops, uses some Irish clich&eacute;s, but makes it work freshly and beautifully.  It is an idealized version where there seem to be no class distinction and Catholic and Protestant peacefully co-exist, which actually they did except in the strife ridden North of Ireland.  This was also a family film, Ford used his brother, son and brother in law, John Wayne's four children, Maureen O'Hara's two brothers, Barry Fitzgerald's brother, and Victor McLaglen's son. The final creation under Ford's scrupulous supervision is a cinema masterpiece, it was justly rewarded with five Oscar nominations including Best Film, winning for Best Director and Best Cinematography, but as I said earlier, it should have been nominated for at least two more and should have swept the Oscars that year!Besides his dream cast, Ford had a wonderful script by Frank S. Nugent, one that featured such hilarious moments as Mary Kate and Michaeleen's discussing Sean's offer for her hand in marriage, Michaeleen's flabbergasted reaction to the Thornton's broken bed the morning after the wedding, and Father Logergan's struggle to land a prize salmon among others.  Yet there are sweet and tender moments such as when Sean surprises Mary Kate with the gift of a horse and buggy, and when the bewildered couple tentatively reaches out to each other in front of the fireplace after an argument about her dowry.  The script crackles with witty one-liners, but is also balanced by dialogue that has gentleness and even some traces of poetry.The cinematography by Winton C. Hoch is spectacular, Ford sensibly put his foot down and insisted Technicolor be used.  The Irish scenery is breathtaking; I swear you can see almost all of the mythical ""Forty Shades of Green"" in the landscape!  If you've never had the pleasure of visiting Ireland before, the cinematography in this film will make you want to go.The musical score is lilting, evocative and romantic, the composer Victor Young has woven traditional Irish songs and airs such as ""The Isle of Innisfree"", ""The Wild Colonial Boy"", ""Kerry Dances"", ""I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen"",""Galway Bay"" and ""The Rakes of Mallow"" into an ingratiating score that adds immeasurably to the film's charm.A very quick note about the special features, the highlights are two excellent documentaries ""The Making of The Quiet Man"" hosted by Leonard Matlin, which presents a well researched history of the film, and ""The Joy of Ireland"" which mainly features the engaging remembrances of Maureen O'Hara, Ms. O'Hara also does a commentary over the film which is very interesting to hear.Well, one of the notorious characteristics of the Irish is the gift of gab, and I guess judging by the length of this review, I'm proving the point.  If I haven't persuaded you that this is highly recommended by now, I never will.  So, I'll close with a few words of Gaelic - ""Slan agus beannacht leat"" (Goodbye and blessings with you)!"	5.0	"""If you'd pass the pub as quickly as you pass the chapel you'd be better off, you little squint!"""	2011-03-24	4	3	1

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	Anyway, the story is an idyll that is really out of time and place.  Apparently it takes place in the early 20th century in Ireland.  It seems to be after the Irish Revolution, but before the First World War.  I say before the war because the movie never references the awful loss of life that traumatized every European nation that experienced it.  Any later than that and you would wonder where the planes and cars would be.It is a good love story, but the whole concept of dowry and the stubborn character shown by the whole Danaher clan would be mysterious to the younger American generation, as would the purpose of a matchmaker and the formal courting rituals that the movie sends up.John Wayne is quite fine in this role as is the whole cast.  It is a very enjoyable film with a lot to recommend it for the family.

It is real and it is spectacular.  I have waited years for a transfer that does this film justice and it is here.

You can donate your crappy Republic & Artisan DVDs (both from the same old and substandard transfer) to your local library or a thrift store and now own and enjoy this great film in all it's three strip Technicolor glory at home for the first time. This transfer, a 4K scan from the original negative says Olive Films, puts the previous DVD versions to shame as well as the laserdisc from the UCLA restoration which had it's own image quality problems. Sound is first rate too. Only extra is the Leonard Maltin 28 minute documentary (in standard definition) on the making of the film which also appeared on the laserdisc and earlier DVD releases. We all owe Olive Films a debt of gratitude for finally giving us the quality presentation that ""The Quiet Man"" deserves! I couldn't recommend it any higher!

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	Sean Thornton has returned to the ancestral seat of the Thorntons of old after living in Pittsburgh as a boxer.  His being named after his grandfather, a well-respected man in the parts despite his later going to Australia as a convict, aids him in being well-liked in Inisfree.  He is made most welcome by elderly and impish Michaleen Flynn, the local matchmaker and pub regular.  Actually, they all are, but Flynn seems out of place without a whisky or beer in his hand.Soon, Thornton meets the fiery-spirited and -haired Mary Kate Danaher, a spinster living with her bullheaded bully of a brother Will.  He initially refuses permission for Thornton to court Mary Kate, mostly out of spite.  Seems that he wanted the old Thornton cottage for himself, but his abrasiveness peeves the owner, the Widow Tillane so much that she sells it to Thornton.However, conspiracies lead to the courtship and eventually the wedding.  The pivotal point comes when Will becomes aware of the conspiracy during the wedding banquet and refuses the dowry of 350 pounds.  Thornton thinks that it's just money, but he doesn't understand that the dowry also represents Mary Kate's honour and dignity.Nowadays, a dowry is virtually nonexistent, but back then, it was a big deal.  It's datedness and lack of female emancipation may not go well with women today.  What is the thrust of this movie is Thornton realizing the difference between American and Irish culture, such as the courting and matchmaking functions, taken so seriously in Inisfree.  And in a place like Inisfree, secrets are hard to keep in this small village, plus it's that group mentality that can be helpful or not to a person.  For instance, Flynn, Father Lonigan, and the other vicar conspire against the bullying Danaher because he is not well-liked and has a point of putting people who speak out against him in his book to get back at them later, yet they become disappointed with Thornton because of his refusal to fight.This was done during the last decade of Victor McLaglen's life--he would be dead in six years, but he does well as Will with that rough voice and craggy face.  He starred in John Ford's three cavalry movies with John Ford opposite Wayne, of which the last had Maureen O'Hara.  And O'Hara (Mary Kate) would star opposite Wayne in Wings of Eagles and McLintock, where she would be just as mistreated by Wayne in the finale.  But Barry Fitzgerald steals the movie as the rascally tippler Flynn.Given my politics, this is one of the few John Wayne movies I'll consider watching over and over.  It isn't just John Ford's direction (Best Director) or the refreshing Irish scenery, which won Best Cinematography but Wayne's mostly understated performance compared to that swaggering &quot;Well, pilgrim&quot; attitude.  There's something comforting about him wearing tweeds and cap compared to a ten-gallon hat, boots, and a Winchester, or a World War II military uniform.	4.0	Story of a quiet peace-loving man	2003-09-12	3	2	1
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A236R025Y84N90	Daniel Martel	Maureen O'Hara is my favorite actress. I own the 40th anniversary VHS edition of The Quiet Man. When I saw that 2002 'Collector's Edition', I was ecstatic and bought it right away. I had rented the first DVD edition and it was pretty bad. But I am even more  disappointed with this 'Collector's Edition'.First of all: This is supposed to have been digitally remastered, but the picture is just a little bit better than the VHS copy, so what gives?Second: it's supposed to be the 'Original Theatrical Version', but where is the original theatrical ratio (a.k.a. Widescreen)?Third: The Quiet Man is a classic John Ford movie and should have been treated as such. Too bad.This DVD editon isn't all bad, though. The extras are a definite plus:1. The making of the Quiet Man, by Leonard Maltin, as on the VHS copy, is good.2. Remembering the Quiet Man Montage is OK. I would have preferred traditional Irish music.3. The Joy of Ireland is a 30 minute documentary with Maureen O'Hara; it's an excellent look back with reminiscences and footage of and from the movie.4. An excellent audio commentary with Maureen O'Hara.That's why this DVD version gets only 3 stars, but The Quiet Man is still my favorite Maureen O'Hara/John Wayne movie.I'm looking forward to see a definitive version, (a Criterion Collector's Edition?), with all the extras present here and sound and picture quality to boot.	3.0	DVDisappointment	2002-11-11	11	8	3

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"I would like to preface my review by saying that this is a horrible transfer of an indispensible film.  Why doesn't the AFI ever list it with the top 100 American films?!  A film of this magnitude deserves the full Criterion treatment and not the shoddy way it's presented here by Artisan.  For sure there were a lot of trademarks to John Ford's films not leastly the whimsical humor in this Valentine to the people and land of Ireland.  Ford's irrepressible stock company (Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen, Mildred Natwick) have never been better and are complemented by the brothers Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields.  This film has always been my father's favorite since I was a kid not ever really understanding why.  Revisiting it as an adult I saw something in ""The Quiet Man"" that would have flew over my head as a kid: an innocent sensuality.  Purists can have Bogie and Bacall or Tracy and Hepburn but for my tastes the most combustive screen couple there ever was were John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara.  View the scenes of them together.  For sure there is certain level of combativeness.  There's also a suggested longing between the two that the makers of today's more explicit love stories just wouldn't understand.  Three scenes stand out in my mind.  Firstly, the scene where Wayne's Sean Thornton seductively holds out Holy Water for O'Hara's Mary Kate Danaher can dip her pinkies in.  Secondly, the scene where Thornton and Mary Kate embrace at the graveyard during a rainstorm.  Lastly, the films closing scene where Mary Kate devilishly whispers something in Thornton's ear and they run back to the cottage grinning ear to ear.  Like the closing shot of Ford's ""The Searchers"" this is the perfect bookend to a cinematic treasure."	5.0	No Patty Fingers If You Please	2008-01-22	0	0	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1SI9KM8QI0KZN	"David Graham ""NoSystem"""	This review is for Olive's Bluray remastering of The Quiet Man. I am an ageing John Wayne fan, and this film is one of my very favorites, inspite of the fact that the DVD and VHS versions until now have been (visually) painful to watch. I knew this film won an Oscar for its cinematography but, until now, it's been hard to see why. Now I see. Olive has done a great job; all fans of great movies (Duke fans or not) owe them big time.The picture is so vastly improved over its poorly predecessors, it's almost shocking. As sharp as you could hope for in a movie this old. I was able to easily make out details utterly invisible before; telephone wires in the background of exterior shots, and drops of rain on Maureen O Hara's face in a scene that was obviously shot hurriedly in one of the brief sunny moments between the rain showers that plagued the production.  (OK, some detail isn't necessarily picturesque, but it shows that Olive did their job well.) If you pause the movie and read the close-up of the newspaper clipping during the scene in Rev. Playfair's study, you will see an example of how this clarity does not always serve the story well. The colors are wonderful, with only the reds of  flowers and skirts being a little overdone. The sound is clear as a bell, and I'm glad they didn't try to concoct a surround track.I would say that we could throw out our nasty old Artisan versions, but Olive did not integrate Maureen O Hara's commentary on to this Bluray, so for that reason (alone) I would recommend you keep the Artisan if you have one.A wonderful story wonderfully acted, beautifully filmed, and now gorgeously remastered. Thanks, Olive. I'm going to watch it again right now.	5.0	Thanks, Olive	2013-01-23	11	9	2

The movie has been reviewed many times and is a favorite of mine so I will concentrate on the quality of the Blu-ray disc itself.  It is superb!  I cannot use the technical terms I read about in other reviews but the scan is perfect to my way of thinking.  The color is beautiful, it is sharp, has great contrast and there is not one glitch in the whole movie.  It looks like a Technicolor movie should.  I have watched it three times on a large screen 1080P TV and I am impressed.  Thanks to the folks at Olive Films for restoring a bunch of John Wayne's films that have not been available in high quality until now.  The booklet in the box is also very good telling the story of the making of the movie.  The special feature video is in standard definition but also enjoyable.	5.0	Finally a Great Copy of this Film!	2013-08-10	1	1	0

I did this using a 53 inch Sony edge lit LCD TV and an up-scaling Sony Blu Ray DVD player.  The difference at every level is amazing.  Clarity of image -- the standard DVD looked like a video tape transfer and had very soft details (at times almost blurred). The blu ray detail showed hair, details of brick, etc.  There was no comparison with respect to color quality.  The blu ray colors sparkled with the very bright, vivid reds that one expects with technicolor.  The blu ray version was generally brighter than the standard version.  I did not detect a major difference in sound between the two versions.  If you have a reasonably large TV screen the blu ray will provide a much more satisfying experience.  If you love this movie, as I do, and re watch it with any regularity, the blu ray version is worth buying even if you have purchased earlier DVD versions.	5.0	The blu ray version is much clearer than the standard DVD	2013-08-23	6	6	0

Bever ""Film Aficionado"""	"I have owned practically every VHS and DVD release of this film since 1992's ""40th Anniversary Edition,"" and they all appear to have been transferred from the same print.  The color saturation is fairly strong, but the detail is indistinct.  I would accept that perhaps this film's unusual distribution history (the fact that many distributors have owned the release rights to this movie over the years) may have contributed to the poor quality, but I recall many years ago seeing a featurette on ""Dateline"" highlighting the restoration of a number of historic Technicolor films, including this one, and the footage in that featurette appeared to be fully restored--or at least superior to all the video transfers I have ever seen.Given its place in the John Wayne/John Ford filmography, ""The Quiet Man"" is an important piece of film history, and it deserves better treatment than it has received.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3GQKB1KF0CRPE	"Deborah MacGillivray ""Author,"""	"When one thinks of John Wayne they usually imagine Calvary, Indians and the Old West. But John, on occasion, did venture into other areas. In this instance, Ireland, and produced one of his most beloved films. It teams him with long time friends, Maureen O'Hara, Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen, Arthur Shields and Barry Fitzgerald (Shields & Fitzgerald were real life brothers), in a project that was near and dear to John Ford. If you think the old town patriarch resembles Ford, it's with reason - it was his father. Stocked with wonderful Irish character actors like David Farrar and Sean McClory, the ever delightful Jack MacGowan, Ken Curtis (Festus of TV's Gunsmoke as Dermot Fahy uncredited and singing! Former Sons of the Pioneers!!), Mildred Natwick as the Widow Tillane, along with Wayne's kids at the horse race scene.Wayne is Sean Thornton, a quite peace loving man come home to Ireland. There is much speculation about the Yanks and why he has returned to the wee humble Irish village where his family was from. He was a fighter in the States named Trooper Thornton, but accidentally killed a man in the ring. Haunted by this he wants to go 'home' to his mother's Ireland and find peace. But his factious neighbours do not understand his reluctance to take on the town Bully Red Will Danaher in order to win the love of his wife O'Hara.Often this movie is criticised as being the ""Brigadoon"" of Ireland, and that is so, but it's the Ireland of our hearts and imagination and obvious of Ford's heart and imagination. The dialogue is Witty, full of Irish quirkiness. Beautiful location work and the dynamite teaming of O'Hara and Wayne. With marvelous songs like Turalye Anne, Galway Bay, Isle of Innisfree and The Humour is On Me Now and more ( There is a soundtrack available on CD this movie as well).For many years the version on VHS was a pale washed out copy, but this version gives you the 40 shades of green of Eire and the brilliant red hair of O'Hara, they way it should be. The DVD is so sharp, it's truly like seeing it for the first time.At this steal of a price, every DVD should have a copy.'Tis Grand, Aye, Grand indeed!"	5.0	A Grand movie it is!!	2003-03-22	100	84	16

It shows all of the lovely pagentry and the landscape of Ireland. It's a fist-knockin' in your face romance cave man style with few physical inhibitions. The Irish custom of you ain't gettin' my booty if I don't get my dowry might be well practiced by some of today's young women in America. It might at least slow the mating process down a little. The supervised courtship and the role of the priests was downright comical at times. The entire small community set from the countryside to the pub to the fiddler on the green and the all county butt kickin' was superbly done. The extra's in the collector's edition especially the interview with Maureen O'Hara was very informative and adds to the value of the DVD.	5.0	THE BEST FILM TO WATCH ON ST.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1Y18V5QEZJ4A1	D. Hostettler	"This is my #1 movie of all time. Filled with John Ford's favorite actors, the director's love of Ireland shines thru. Ford, whose real name was Sean O'Feeney, brings out the best in his stars by allowing them to be what I perceive as ""themselves"". Their real love and admiration for each other served to give their characters a beleivabilty that comes off the screen and into my heart. The beautiful countryside, village rogues, and touch of religious/political tension makes the story credible. In this movie, the villain is replaced with a stubborness that is based on both pride and love, real human emotions. I have worn out at least 2 VHS tapes of this film and will probably wear out the dvd.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2FOT0QE23VN6J	Dr. James Gardner	"""The Quiet Man"" (1952) was nominated for 7 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor, and won 2 (Best Director and Best Cinematographer). John Ford also won the DGA award that year as well as the International Award at the Venice Film festival and was nominated for a Golden Globe. Screenwriter Frank Nugent won a WGA award.John Wayne stars as a former boxer who moves from the US to his ancestral home in Ireland.  Wayne was a major box office draw at the time, having appeared in such hits as ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""They Were Expendable"" (1944), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), ""Rio Grande"" (1950), and ""Flying Leathernecks"" (1951). He was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949). ""The Quiet Man"" was Wayne's 131st film.Ford and Wayne worked together on 21 films, one of the most prodigious collaborations in film history. ""The Quiet Man"" is amongst their best works, along with ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""The Searchers"" (1956). This was Ford's 118th film (including 61 silent films). He had already won 3 Oscars - ""How Green was My Valley"" (1941), ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940), and ""The Informer""(1935) - and made such memorable films as ""Stagecoach"" in 1939 (Oscar nominated but not a winner) and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" in 1949.The great Victor McLaglen co-stars as a pugnacious hard drinking Irishman known as ""The Squire"". McLaglen won an Oscar for his performance in ""The Informer"" (1935), directed by John Ford. Ford and McLaglen worked together on 12 films, including Ford's cavalry trilogy (""Fort Apache"", ""Yellow Ribbon"", and ""Rio Grande"") in which Ford, Wayne, and McLaglen collaborated.  Wayne and McLaglen worked together 4 times, each time under Ford's direction. ""The Quiet Man"" would be their last film together, and for McLaglen, it would be his last good film, although he would go on to make 11 films up until his death in 1959. Personally I believe McLaglen's performance in this film is his best ever, far superior to his Oscar winning effort in ""The Informer.""Maureen O'Hara is the leading lady, playing McLaglen's sister and the apple of Wayne's eye. Ford and O'Hara worked together on only 5 films, but she was his favorite leading lady, not the least reason being that she was Irish through and through. Early on she lit up the screen at 19 as Esmeralda in ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939) and followed that with her first John Ford film in ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941) for which Ford won his second Oscar. She could play comedy (""Miracle on 34th Street in 1947), or action (""Bagdad"" in 1949). ""The Quiet Man"" was her second film with John Wayne (they worked together on ""Rio Grande"" in 1950) and they would make 3 more together - ""Big Jake"" (1971), ""McClintock"" (1963), and ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957). This is one of O'Hara's best performances. BTW - she had a beautiful voice and she sang in several of her films, including this one.The chemistry between O'Hara, McLaglen and Wayne is magical, enhanced by their long history together.""The Quiet Man"" includes a few of Ford's stock company regulars, notably Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, Barry Fitzgerald, Ken Curtis, Hank Worden, and Francis Ford.- Ward Bond was a football player at USC with his life time friend, John Wayne, and together they appeared in nearly a dozen films including ""They Were Expendable"" (1945), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""3 Godfathers"" (1948), ""The Searchers"" (1956), ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957), and ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). Without Wayne, Bond was also a staple in Ford's stock company and appeared in ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" (1939), ""Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)"", ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and ""The Grapes of Wrath (1940) among the 25 films they made together. He's probably best remembered for his role as Major Seth Adams on the TV series ""Wagon Train"" (1957 - 1961), based on the 1950 film ""Wagon Master"" in which he appeared. Bond was in more  Top 100 AFI films (7) than any other actor, and appeared in 11 films that were nominated as Best Picture. His part in ""The Quiet Man"" is small and undistinguished.- Mildred Natwick made her film debut in Ford's ""The Long Voyage Home"" (1940) and followed this with appearances in ""3 Godfathers"" (1948), and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1948). ""The Quiet Man"" was her last Ford film, but she would continue and earn an Oscar nomination for ""Barefoot in the Park"" (1967) and she won an Emmy for ""The Snoop Sisters"" (1973). Her performance in ""The Quiet Man"" is a real hoot, and one of her very best.- Francis Ford was John's older brother. He was a writer and a director and also an actor, appearing in several films directed by his younger brother - ""The Informer"" (1935), and ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939).  ""The Quiet Man"" was his last film with his brother.- Ken Curtis (he played Charley McCorry in ""The Searchers"") has a small role as an accordion player. Curtis was married to John Ford's daughter and Ford kept him busy in many films including ""Rio Grande"" (1950), ""Mr. Roberts"" (1955), ""The Searchers"" (1956), ""The Last Hurrah"" (1958), ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959), ""Two Rode Together"" (1961), and ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964). Curtis is probably best remembered for his role as Festus in the TV series ""Gunsmoke"" (1964 - 1975). In addition to his considerable skills as an actor, Curtis was also a well known singer and he is often heard singing in his films.- The great Irish character actor Barry Fitzgerald is a riot in this film as the comic (and usually drunk) foil. Ford used him in ""The Plough and the Stars"" (1936), ""The Long Voyage Home"" (1941), ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941), and ""The Quiet Man"" which was their last film together. For his performance in ""Going My Way"" (1944) with Bing Crosby, Fitzgerald won a Golden Globe and a NY Film Critics Award and an Oscar. He made history by being nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for the same role in the same film.- Hank Worden (played ol' Mose in ""The Searchers"") appears briefly in a flashback. Worden made over 100 films, many with Ford starting with ""Stagecoach"" in 1939. His role here is brief, but fans will enjoy how different he appears in this film.Many of Ford's other regulars are missing - like Willis Bouchey (the newspaper man in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance""), Anna Lee (played the insane Mrs. Malaprop in ""Two Rode Together""),  Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., Olive Carry (Harry's mom, who played Mrs. Jorgensen in ""The Searchers""), John Qualen (played Lars Jorgensen  in ""The Searchers""), and Andy Devine (driver in ""Stagecoach"" ).Charles Fitzsimmons appears briefly. He was Maureen O'Hara's brother, her agent, and, on occasions her producer (""The Deadly Companions"" directed by Sam Peckinpah). ""The Quiet Man"" was his acting debut but his career was short-lived, ending in 1958, with few appearances credited.The film is a family affair. The Fords were represented by John, Francis, and their brother-in-law, Ken Curtis. Maureen O'Hara had two brothers, James and Charles, on the payroll. Barry Fitzgerald and his younger brother Arthur Shields are on board. And John Wayne managed to get all four of his children in as well.This film has many key Ford elements. We see the dynamic rivalry between the male leads (e.g., John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter in ""The Searchers"", John Wayne and Henry Fonda in ""Fort Apache"", John Wayne and William Holden in ""The Horse Soldiers""), the importance of family (""How Green was My Valley"", ""The Searchers""), his use of the comic foil (e.g., Victor McLaglen in ""Yellow Ribbon"", Ken Curtis in ""The Searchers""), the sacrifice of long held principles to attain a higher end (e.g., Ethan gives up his secret plan to kill Natalie Wood in ""The Searchers"",  Captain Brittles decides to forego ""one last mission"" and accept his age in ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon""),  and Ford's wonderful camera work, not only in the medium shot but in the action sequences. The climatic fist fight between Wayne and McLaglen is terrific.As already noted, the film was an enormous critical success. It was widely known as the best film Republic Pictures ever produced. Commercially, at $3.8 million, it was one of the top 10 grossing pictures of 1952. Ironically enough, it out-grossed ""Rio Grande"" which came in at $2.2 million, and Republic studio execs had insisted that Ford (plus Wayne, O'Hara, and McLaglen) make ""Rio Grande"" to pay for the losses they anticipated ""The Quiet Man"" would produce.""The Quiet Man"" is a must see film. Fans of Wayne, O'Hara, and McLaglen, as well as Barry Fitzgerald and Mildred Natwick, will be treated to some of their very best performances, and fans of John Ford will see what the master could do."	5.0	One of the very best	2010-04-03	6	2	4
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AL3NJPKAGVXIK	"Dr. Pretorius ""kalis man"""	"I've always had an aversion to John Wayne. My family were horsey type people and of course they loved westerns and loved John Wayne. So I, being the rebellious type, hated him. I got over childish rebellions but still don't like John Wayne. He's just not a good actor. Like George Raft and Keannu Reeves, he is only capable of playing himself. To me he is more of a character actor than a leading man. His swaggering machismo, which makes him a god to the chest-beaters, only makes me yawn.So when I finally bought this film it was for the Technicolor, Maureen Ohara, and John Ford. (But after watching it I had to admit that Wayne did a good job.) It is a great film. I only wish there was a descent print. I bought the version that was supposed to be the better one, but it is still terrible. You can tell that the colors are supposed to be amazing. A good technicolor film is like watching a painting that moves. This is one of those films. But the print is alternately fuzzy and blown out. Sometimes, the faces are actually orange. What a shame that these precious parts of our heritage don't get the treatment they deserve unless some film industry beaurocrats decide that preservation is cost effective.P.S.

This is the best version currently available and the making of documentary is worth having, but we aren't going to see a Blu-ray version until the print is restored. This version does not deserve the Collector's Edition title but is worthwhile just for the commentary.	3.0	You get what you pay for...	2011-04-08	2	2	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2TXR85WQLE32N	D. S. Thurlow	"John Ford's 1952 classic, ""The Quiet Man"", has held up extremely well as a viewing experience all these many years.  It offers a fine cast, a good story with an engaging mix of comedy, romance, and drama, and of course the lovely land of Ireland itself.John Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an American ex-boxer who returns to his home village in Ireland after inadvertantly killing a man in the ring.  He makes an immediate enemy out of town bully Will by buying a choice piece of property out from under his greedy nose, then dares to romance Will's fiery sister Mary Kate (an excellent Maureen O'Hara).  Sean and Mary Kate will struggle to arrive at an understanding, only to be undercut by Will, who refuses Mary Kate's dowry.  The stage is set for an magnificent brawl to the finish.  The diminutive but hilarious Barry Fitzgerald almost steals the movie as the driver of the local horse taxi and keeper of all bets.The vivid color technology of the movie takes a little getting used to, as does the exurberant acting.  The movie is perhaps overlong for its plot, but Ford uses the extra time to showcase his native Ireland.  The collector's edition has several extra features on the making of the movie.  ""The Quiet American"" is highly recommended to fans of John Ford and John Wayne."	5.0	The Quiet American Goes Home...	2012-03-21	1	1	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	APM06HT7JIPZ5	"Erik Morton ""Erik Morton"""	"Well, here I go again, giving a less-than-ecstatic review for a renowned and beloved classic.  Now let it be stated outright that I am a lover of classic films (because, let's face it, movies used to be better . . . in most cases, a LOT better!), and I am a big fan of the filmographies of both John Wayne and John Ford.  But try as I might, I just couldn't get into 'The Quiet Man' as much as I had hoped.I'm not the sort of fellow who demands rapid-fire pacing in his movies, and I admire a film that has the confidence to take its time, but even so I found 'The Quiet Man' a little too slow-going for me.  The storyline was kind of repetitive, and only interesting for so long.  In a way, I don't think there was ENOUGH of a story.  Maybe the movie could have used a little trimming in the editing room, who knows, but I just thought the bizarre sexual politics between Wayne and Maureen O'Hara went on far too long, to the point where I was getting more frustrated than entertained.  And I realize that Ford may have very well intended for this to happen, to put the audience right alongside Wayne's character, who is a confused and bewildered by the customs of Irish marriage, dowry, etc., but again, it reached the point where I was no longer enjoying the movie so much.The best parts of the movie were the beautiful Irish countryside scenery and Maureen O'Hara.  As I read in another review of the film, in any other hands this character/film could have been a disaster, but she pulls it off, and it's a pleasure to hear her speak in her native Irish accent.  That said, her fine performance only carried the movie so far; after a while, her character dipped from complex woman set in her ways and conflicted by her feelings, to a shrill and irritating harpy.  As far as Wayne is concerned, this movie shows off both his strengths and weaknesses as an actor.  Sometimes he comes off as flat (which I must say, as much as I love the Duke, he was prone to do at times), and other times he conveys his emotions perfectly (like during his early courtings of O'Hara, or during the flashback boxing scene . . . the look on Wayne's face is heartbreaking).  Overall, it's not one of his better/best performances, but it's far from one of his worst.Ford once again fills his picture with a plethora of colorful supporting characters, but this time their antics only go so far to keep the film afloat.  And regarding ALL of the characters in the film, I may come off sounding a little dense here, but I found their motivations confusing.  I didn't understand why they did certain things, or acted certain ways (and it's not due to my relative unfamiliarity with Irish customs; I'd willingly admit if it was, but that has nothing to do with it).  I thought the movie was pretty weird, in this way.Now, up to this point I realize I've sounded quite harsh and negative towards this film.  But let me say that it's not a bad movie at all, far from it!  In fact, there are certain scenes in this movie that are so joyous, so wonderful, so thrillingly happy that I was almost moved to tears out of sheer delight (I'm thinking of the scene where Wayne and O'Hara steal away on a two-seated bicycle during their courting).  If the whole movie were like this, I'd give 'The Quiet Man' an easy 5 stars.  But as the movie goes on, the magic starts to dwindle.  And when people call this one of John Ford's best films (if not his VERY best), I can't help but scoff a little.  We're talking about the man who gave us 'My Darling Clementine,' 'She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,' 'The Searchers,' 'How Green Was My Valley,' and 'The Grapes of Wrath,' among many, many others.  'The Quiet Man' just doesn't compare.  And I'm not saying this because it's light-hearted entertainment (I'm not one of those snobs who thinks a movie can't be ""real art"" unless it's a seriouus, sober drama), I'm saying it because it's not as well-made a movie, plain and simple.In conclusion, 'The Quiet Man' is certainly worth seeing, and I of course acknowledge that it's one of those ""must-see"" films if you're a fan of either John Wayne or John Ford (or Maureen O'Hara, for that matter . . . dang, what a classy lady she was and is!)  What I DON'T recommend is going into it with the expectations you'd naturally acquire given the film's glowing reputation."	3.0	It's A Pleasant Enough Picture, But One Of Ford's Best?

I purchased this film directly from Olive Films after initially purchasing a different title from them. If you have the means to do so don't hesitate to purchase this film over the garish Artisan release with the colors bleeding and looking milky. Unfortunately, as others have mentioned Olive Films does not provide closed captioning for the hearing impaired. Aside from a booklet, the only other feature is a reycled ""Making of Quiet Man"" hosted by Maltin which I believe is from the Artisan release.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AUHVRUCP7PCFL	"Eugene Koh ""LA Reader"""	This movie was one of John Ford's most personal, and he struggled to find the funding to do it since the studios saw this as &quot;just another love story&quot;.  &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; is a fantastic love story, with wonderful scenes (the famous &quot;windy kiss&quot;), classic lines, and snappy humor.Be warned, however, that even in the &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; DVD, the picture quality is terrible, especially if compared with the restored &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;, which was released the same year.  It is grainy and sometimes blurry, and the color vacillates in intensity.

John Ford directed John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara in this romantic comedy.  Ford takes a sentimental trip down memory lane to his homeland and it never looked so green.  Barry Fitzgerald plays the impish..you'd swear he's a leprechaun..matchmaker to comic perfection.  Wayne plays Sean Thornton returning home to buy the old homestead and put down roots.  He meets the curious townspeople and awakens this sleepy hamlet by not always sticking to the 'proprieties'. Besides being American and new to town, this 'Wild Colonial Boy' has plans.  Buying 'White O'Mornin'..his old homestead..from the widow Tillane gets him in the book with Will Danaher (Victor Mclaglen) and soon the love of Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara).  This eventually builds to the knock-down brawl that resolves all the issues.Ford used his stock players to round out this film...Ward Bond, Ken Curtis, etc.  This movie has many facets, and fortunately for us, Ford keeps it lively...he didn't delve too deeply into these.  There is the IRA, Catholics vs Protestants, and the mixture of a Gaelic patriarchal society.  These Sean has to face and adjust to in order to win his wife as well as his place in this society.There is a reason that this movie is on many lists of great films.  This is a well acted and directed movie.  One that deserve a place in any and all collections.	5.0	Happy Saint Patrick's Day..and no patty fingers if you please!	2006-03-17	3	3	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3BH49ZKESHDID	Fred Camfield	John Wayne started out with Stagecoach and ended his career with motion pictures like True Grit.  He is probably most strongly identified with westerns, and possibly with various war pictures made in between, but he also made this motion picture along the way.  It is a delightful motion picture about a man escaping from his past which he tried to keep secret, but finds himself wrapped into Irish customs to win the woman he loves.  His brother-in-law to be wants to fight him for the dowry.There were good performances all the way around, and some Irish scenery along the way.  It could give you an urge to move back to the Old Sod.In regard to the negative reviews, people should be careful of the source and the version.  There are a lot of cheap knockoffs for popular motion pictures, many manufactured overseas.

According to Amazon a new ""collector's edition""is coming in October, 2002. Hopefully it will be an improvement. I'd check that one out first. [By the way at least one reviewer is hoping for a "" widescreen "" dvd version of ""TQM"". This movie wasn't made in widescreen. With a very few rare exceptions widescreen movies didn't come into existence until 1953 after the groundbreaking premier in the fall of 1952 of CINERAMA , a curved- screen super immersive widescreen process that out- imaxed Imax. Without getting too technical movies before 1953 were pretty much what today's tv viewers would refer to as ""full screen""-roughly the shape of a standard tv screen.This includes ""TQM"".  Even then a full changeover to widescreen/scope didn't happen overnight. Check out The American Widescreen Museum on the web for a terrific and highly entertaining history of scope, color and sound in the movies.[I have no personal involvement in this site-just think its definitely worth a look]  Yes, there was life in the cinema before ""Phantom George and The Digital Menace.]"	1.0	Lousy DVD	2002-09-05	14	13	1

The video transfer is very nice, with bright vivid colors.  There are a few places where there are some imperfections obviously in the original source, but overall, this transfer is top notch.  I have seen this movie literally dozens of times over the last four decades, and watching this blu-ray was like watching it for the first time.  The old VHS and DVD versions were so dark in places, it was hard to make out exactly what was going on, and even scenes that were supposed to be bright and sunny looked like they were filmed on an overcast day.  Not so here.  For example, there is a scene near the end of the movie where Sean and Will are coming home for supper.  There is a shot where the camera pans up to the cottage.  In the old versions, it was so dark, that all you could see was the exterior of the cottage.  In this blu-ray, you can actually see Mary Kate standing in the doorway.  The sound quality is good as well, but only available in mono due to the source material.  I highly recommend this version to any fan of The Quiet Man, even if you own previous versions.

Like ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""The African Queen,"" and several others, it is absolutely perfect: wonderful performances, touching love story, sophisticated comedy, and beautiful, vibrant, three-strip Technicolor photography, which made the already beautiful landscape of Ireland even more gorgeous. When I bought the DVD, I had expected a major improvement over my old VHS copy; but, like many other discerning film buffs (I am glad I am not alone), I was truly appalled by the wretched transfer. Republic should be blasted for not giving this great movie the loving digital restoration and clean-up of the original negative which make the DVDs of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" such a joy to watch. In this DVD, the flesh tones are not true to life, the colors muddied, and the clarity EXTREMELY poor. There are fuzzy halos around the characters which are worse than some 20-year-old VHS copies of other films. Granted, this film has never looked good on VHS, but there is no other movie in my collection which I can honestly say looks NO better on DVD than it did/does on VHS.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AGLQXI48J4AI5	G. Peterson	This DVD is awful. The colors are terrible: the greens and magentas are all out of whack, and the colors seem to constantly flicker and shift, as if they cannot maintain the correct hue and instead change slightly every few frames. It's a difficult thing to explain, but it's terribly obvious in the video. Aside from the distracting color issues, the video is grainy and blurry.The audio is sufficient, but only just so. It's decent quality only considering how old the source material is. It certainly won't impress anyone, but it's serviceable, and less abusive than the picture.It's upsetting that a film like The Quiet Man doesn't get a better home video presentation. What it really needs is a complete restoration (and an expensive one, unfortunately). I've heard people say that the VHS release of this movie is technically superior to this DVD. I'm inclined to believe them, having seen this disc.Buy this only if you REALLY need to have this film right now on DVD. If you can stand it, you might want to wait and see if there will be a restored version in the near future (hopefully on Blu-Ray). The technology is there to make it look like new (they did it with Casablanca, with impressive results). I'll keep my fingers crossed that something similar happens here someday.	1.0	This film deserves a better presentation.	2011-08-22	1	1	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1BII6VJGFPKKP	Granddaddy	I'm reviewing the 60th Anniversary Special Edition Blu-ray disc. Amazon unfortunately conflates reviews of different products giving very misleading scores and reviews, so be careful.Several days before St. Patrick's Day I was enjoying my annual viewing of this great movie in the Collector's Edition DVD (2002) and annoying grandmommie with my annual grumbling about the muddy colors, purple fringed trees, shadow landscapes, and blurry characters. I looked up some information about the movie using the IMDB app on my KFHD8.9 and happened to click on the link to Amazon. That's how I found out about this new edition available both on DVD and on Blu-ray. Sorting out the appropriate reviews from the mess Amazon creates by running together reviews of different products containing this movie, I immediately ordered the Blu-ray so I could watch it before March 17. It came overnight with free shipping thanks to Amazon Prime and the new Amazon distribution center a few miles up the road.The Blu-ray 60th Anniversary Special Edition brings us a new Quiet Man, one that gives us the texture of the land, the costumes, and the faces of the actors. The colors are glorious (though I read this morning that the head of Republic Pictures complained that everything was green.)If you love this movie, get this edition. If you've never seen the movie but enjoy being Irish at St. Patrick's Day, get this edition.	5.0	At long last a great edition of this great movie	2013-03-15	5	4	1

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AKKSHEGRQVQRK	Great Movie Addict	"This raucously tongue-in-cheek, grand old movie has survived for what seems an eternity. The performances are so wonderful that every moment outshines a great many other classic films. So it seems a shame that I can't give TQM the 5 stars it deserves. But Artisan's Classic Edition DVD has far too many visual transgressions. The gorgeous bursts of color that won an Oscar for the 1952 release are almost totally absent in this third-rate digital print. The jacket blurb claims this is a ""remastered"" version; in fact it looks as if it were played on a cheap VCR; blurry, too dark (almost grimy and gritty at times), with no shadow detail whatever, color registration problems, badly oversaturated reds and blues, obvious flicker (odd for a ""remastered"" print), and with noise and digital artifacts galore. The blur and noise extend even into many segments of the added features. Looks out of focus on a good CRT monitor, and extremely annoying on highend LCD sets. On cheaper gear, it's nearly unviewable. I've seen comments in Amazon reviews saying that this edition looks better than earlier ones. Not true -- visually, they're all the same. On top of that, I have always had a problem with some oddities of John Ford's sense of humor: two big guys blasting each other with bare fists for the better part of an Irish afternoon isn't very funny, IMHO. In real life, these two would have spent a year in an IC ward recovering from wounds. It's likely that TQM will be one of many memorable films, like ""The African Queen"", that may never be seen in its original Technicolor glory. But it's to the movie's credit that despite the poor print, it remains an exceptional cinematic experience. The acting is superb in every way; Barry Fitzgerald and Ward Bond steal every scene they're in. Victor Young's music is beautiful, and the audio has the sweep and sweetness that I rememeber from 1952. Now, if only someone could give us a true and more conscientiouse visual restoration . . ."	3.0	Great flick, poor video -- but still worth a try	2007-08-29	7	5	2

I agree with most of the my fellow posters here. John Ford's film never seems small (how could it be with John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara at its center?), but this is a lovely character-driven film. Wayne is at his peak here. commanding every frame and never over-doing it. O'Hara's the heart of soul of this movie, and the chemistry between these two stars is right up there with any great screen duo you care to mention. Barry Fitzgerald is charm personified as the friend who engineers their love story, and Victor McLaughlin (a Ford regular) is outstandingly unlikable as the O'Hara's pain-in-the-arse brother. Ireland's scenery is in its glory here. All the local characters are charmingly captured, not for the cliches, but for the color they bring to these roles. Both stars are Oscar-worthy and it's a pity they didn't win. No matter, this is a lovely film to be savored over and over again.	5.0	Wayne & O'Hara Make for a Memorable Irish Love Story	2014-07-06	0	0	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A276M3NSIY9B82	Harry Brewer	"ESSENTIAL MOVIE!!! This is the one that John Wayne should've won the Oscar for Best Actor. John Ford, winner of the Oscar as the Best Director for this film, gets John Wayne to turn in the best acting performance of his career. It was rare that John Wayne portrayed a character but in this movie he proved to be far more than capable.The Quiet Man is one of the great romantic movies of all time. It's also has one of the greatest fight scenes ever filmed. Both ladies & men will enjoy this one. The chemistry between John Wayne & Maureen O'Hara is electric. Victor McLaglen is fine as the older brother of O'Hara, certainly one of his greatest roles, especially at the end of his career. Barry Fitzgerald & Ward Bond are featured & they shine also.You can tell John Ford had a love for Ireland, his birthplace, it shows in the way the movie was filmed. The scenery shines as much as the stars.  There are many scenes from this movie that are classics including the final 15 minutes of the film that has Wayne dragging O'Hara across the fields taking her back to McLaglen.The Quiet Man has something for both male & female. Love, action & comedy abound in this well crafted movie Wayne portrays a boxer who has retired because he killed a man in the ring. The two things that Wayne no longer cares for, money & fighting, are the two things that seems to matter the most to O'Hara. It's when John Wayne is accused of cowardice by Maureen O'Hara that things come to a head.The packaging claims that the movie has been digitally remastered &, though it looks pretty good, it doesn't look that good. This particular release has several bonus features that includes a documentary hosted by Leonard Maltin that is full of trivia. Maureeen O'Hara does a commentary & there's a montage feature.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	"For John Ford and John Wayne, los hombres mas machos, THE QUIET MAN is them showing their softer side. This movie is absolutely my favorite John Ford film and one of my top favorite films starring the Duke. I'm not even remotely Irish and yet I can't help but get all mushy and nostalgic whenever this airs on the screen.You're in for a surprise if you've only ever seen John Wayne take on those tough, rough-n-tumble man of action roles in all those wild westerns, war pictures, and cop dramas. THE QUIET MAN features a more introspective, more reflective John Wayne. He plays laconic but friendly Irish-American Sean Thornton, come to the tiny Irish village of Innisfree to flee a haunted past and find a measure of peace. But peace and quiet are hard to come by, even in this bucolic ancestral home. Sean Thornton is instantly smitten with the fiery lass Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), only to learn that winning her isn't at all a simple feat, what with the rigid local courtship customs and also that her brother is none other than that bullying and blustery landowner ""Red"" Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen). And ""Red"" Will Danaher thinks Thornton a coward and endlessly baits him, with Thornton reluctant to raise his fists. But when his continued passiveness threatens to lose him the respect of the community and of Mary Kate, it may just come down to Sean taking a stand, after all, and picking up them fists.THE QUIET MAN is John Ford's big, corny valentine to his native Ireland, so it's not too surprising that we find ourselves in idealized sceneries, treated to picturesque cinematography and sentimental goings-on. THE QUIET MAN garnered Ford his fourth Oscar for directing, which must've been a huge ""In Your Face!"" to all the larger studios who gave the movie the fish eye. Instead, it was lowly ""B"" studio Republic Pictures which took a chance and bankrolled Ford's pet project, after, of course, first squeezing a little black & white western out of Wayne, O'Hara and Ford, so as to recoup whatever losses THE QUIET MAN might accrue. Well, not only did RIO GRANDE prove to be a financial success, but THE QUIET MAN, to the surprise of many, made a killing at the box office.It's a delightful character study, enlivened by Ford's stock troop of actors, with Barry Fitzgerald and Ward Bond particular standouts as, respectively, the puckish matchmaker Michaleen Oge Flynn and Father Lonergan. The film is also a broad, whimsical comedy of manners which now and then gets upstaged by Wayne and O'Hara's tempestuous romance. Wayne's dashing Sean Thornton, by the way, should settle any doubts about whether the Duke can play meaty romantic leading roles. He and Maureen O'Hara ignite the screen.And, of course, of course, it all culminates with a raucous, knock-down marathon brawl between Red Will Danaher and the finally fed-up Sean Thornton, to the rapture of the Innisfree community (who quickly begins placing bets). Before the donnybrook, though, one of the funniest moments in the film comes up, and never mind that it isn't too politically correct in this day and age. It's this: As Sean Thornton wrestles his departing Mary Kate off the train and then marches her all the long way home, an old woman emerges from the gathering onlookers and offers Sean a good-sized branch: ""Sir! Here's a good stick to beat the lovely lady."" Heh."	5.0	"""Sir! Here's a good stick to beat the lovely lady."""	2009-06-30	1	1	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AADKS0Q4A73P4	H. Edgar Hix	My favorite novella is &quot;The Quiet Man.&quot;  The movie is loosely based on the story.  Sometimes very loosely.  Nonetheless, its themes of love and honor are ageless.  I have watched it many times since I was a  boy.  Some of the material is now offensive, like the woman offering Shawn  a stick &quot;to hit the lady with.&quot;  But, this movie is set in a time  and a culture that was politically incorrect by our standards.  If you  really want the cultural aspect, I suggest the novella over the movie.  The  biggest difference between the two is not the fight scene at the end,  though that is significantly different.  The biggest difference is that the  novella was made to move you and the movie was made for enjoyment.	5.0	Old Fan Says This One Doesn't Age	1999-12-07	2	2	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2YNT4QDEQX30F	H. Snyder	"Beautifully photographed in Technicolor, with a host of mostly Irish stars and character actors, The Quiet Man was John Ford's love letter to his native Ireland, written on a picture postcard. Toiling at the time for Republic Pictures, turning out western movie after western movie, Ford ached to return to Ireland to film what he referred to as ""the Irish story"". But location shooting in Ireland would be expensive, and Republic wanted Ford to continue with the money-making westerns he was directing, which are now considered to be among the best of the genre. So Republic offered a deal: do another western for us, and we'll back the Irish story. That western was the classic Rio Grande.In The Quiet Man, John Wayne is a native son returning to Ireland to find the tranquility of his birthplace and leave behind a boxing tragedy in his past. Maureen O'Hara is a (genuine) red-haired Irish girl with whom he is smitten at first sight. But she has a loud and aggressive brother, played by Victor McLaglen, who objects to any marriage with a ""Yank"". A widespread conspiracy is needed to hoodwink McLaglen into allowing the marriage, and includes not only townsfolk, but also the Catholic Priest (Ward Bond) and the Protestant Reverend (Arthur Shields). Barry Fitzgerald is the official matchmaker, and the driver of the Jaunting Car in the iconic courting scene. But of course all of this is building up to a fight between Wayne the reluctant boxer, and McLaglen the bullying blowhard.Infused with not only skill, but love of the homeland, The Quiet Man turned out to be one of Ford's best. It was also one of John Wayne's best, and without doubt the finest of his several films with Maureen O'Hara. It was a nepotistic family affair, with Ford's brother and son-in-law, O'Hara's two brothers, and Wayne's four children all playing roles. The biggest role, ""relatively"" speaking, was that of Barry Fitzgerald's younger brother (Arthur Shields) who played the Protestant Reverend in the overwhelmingly Catholic town of Innisfree. Ford's brother Francis' role was as the aged, bearded townsman who, surrounded by weeping womenfolk and a Catholic priest, leaps out of his deathbed and runs down the street to witness the donnybrook between Wayne and McLaglen.The Olive Films Blu-ray is typical in every way, featuring video that is vastly superior to the DVD version, good sound, a sparse selection of special features, and no subtitles. So keep the DVD for its extras, especially the commentary by Maureen O'Hara, and luxuriate in the color and clarity of the Blu-ray edition."	5.0	John Ford's Love Letter to Ireland, on Blu-ray at Last!	2013-09-19	3	3	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AR7VKYTDJZZ4N	intellex@home.com	From a lawyer's point of view, The Quiet Man gives an interesting insight into the ancient custom of dower or the bride's &quot;fortune&quot; as the movie has it.  Legally, the husband had the right to administer the dower  fund but could not use it for himself. He was a trustee of his wife's money  and in effect the money was her reserve in the event the marriage failed.  In the movie, however, when Sean Thornton finally gets his brother-in-law  to hand over the fortune, he and Kate take the money and throw it into the  furnace. Thus, it was true love since Kate was willing to give up her  fortune for her man.  All that being said, it's the greatest movie about  Ireland ever made and, like Casablanca, I can recite every word,  particularly that great phrase about &quot;they're bringing them by bus  from Ballygoon.&quot;	5.0	A Fascinating Look at the Custom of Dower	1999-03-24	1	1	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AZ6JSVJX4EMX5	"""intrepidtraveler"""	What on earth?!  I love this movie.  Therefore I cannot understand all the positive reviews for this DVD.  (I can only assume most are simply reviewing the movie itself.)  How many of us looked for a &quot;Quiet Man&quot; DVD, hopping to find something that captured John Ford's original vision?  Wouldn't a digitally remastered, wide-screen, surround sound version of this be an incredible addition to any movie buff's library?  (To all the nay-sayers, a high quality DVD version of an old movie can indeed be produced - see Citizen Kane).  This DVD has all the technological quality of a 15 year old video tape.  The sound, full screen picture etc. are all second tier.  The &quot;making of&quot; feature is interesting.  However, if you love this movie, nothing will make up for the overall lack of quality.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2KQ2UPQVHOIK5	Irish Flair	"I waited a while before buying this DVD.  What finally spurred me to do it was the audio commentary by Maureen O'Hara.  Let me say here and now that I am so glad I did buy it.As a story, The Quiet Man has a bit of everything with some adventure, some romance, some minor violence, some humor and a whole lotta heart.  As a DVD, this one is right up with some of the most up-to-date, extra-feature laden ones out there.  I loved the new documentary ""The Joy of Ireland"" as well as the movie commentary with Ms O'Hara.This DVD has restored audio which only enhances the movie.  I'm not sure that much of anything can be done about the picture quality - my VHS tape was the exact same and it has been the same for every screening I've ever seen of this movie.  I really believe that the film, cameras and audio at that time just can not be improved upon, even by today's technology possibly just due to the age and quality of the film then.  There are lots of little mistakes that audiences today would never `go for' that had to have been just edited like that back in 1951, like words in speeches being sound-edited out but not redoing the scene and the sound of the words being sung not matching the mouth movements.I enjoyed listening to Maureen O'Hara's comments through the film although she did tend to repeat herself a bit (but, come on, she's in her 80s!).  Still even that was endearing as she relived those happy times and reminisced about her many friends, most of whom she's lost over time.  She often would point out her brothers or other cast member's family when they appeared on screen, she translates Mary Kate's confession to Father Lonergan (finally, now I know!) and gives interesting insights about director John Ford.  I found the cost of the DVD worth it in that information alone.This a moving and wonderful movie.  The DVD format allows you to view the movie that much more often without having to worry about ruining your tape by too much rewinding as well as allowing us a peek into the lives and times of the people who made such a fantastic film."	5.0	Oh So Worth It!	2003-03-12	11	7	4

You would think that the 60th Anniversary edition would include much more about the movie.  (As some have noted already, there are no closed captions.)  The extra about the making of the movie has great information, but is of very poor visual quality.  It's less than 30 min. long and should have been improved to match the movie.  However, the interviews and stories are just great.I would have very much liked for it to have a commentary track to expand on the history of the movie and the people involved, as was included on the DVD version.Still, you can't beat the gorgeous picture quality in this product.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2BFIYZYNK54QX	"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale"""	For me, John Ford's epic yet also intimate personal love letter to Ireland, THE QUIET MAN, is one of the great films of all time. I've only ever seen it on broadcast TV, VHS and the previous DVD release, and I was still enamored of the seeming over-saturation of color hues of the previous releases. But seeing it cleaned up, and removing some of that saturation has given a crisper, clearer and surprisingly more beautiful release on Blu-Ray.However, my main issue with this release is that, for all the beauty it gives, it's taken out some of the bonus features that remained on the previous DVD release; the best of them being the commentary track by the thankfully not-departed Maureen O'Hara, arguably the most beautiful woman to have ever lived (at least in my mind). I don't know that if Republic or whatever company owned the previous version's rights, but this is a supplement that should absolutely be on this disc, as well as any other supplemental material they could have put out for one of the greatest films ever made.It's still absolutely worth your money though.	5.0	Man, does this look BEAUTIFUL on Blu-Ray.	2013-05-21	3	2	1

The music, the scenery, the story line and the dialogue ensure its enduring status.A real test of a work of art is whether the viewer keeps finding something new in it time after time.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	ALTJKDWT2B1GB	James	"The Quiet Man is a romantic comedy of sorts and is very much a nostalgic John Ford view of his Irish homeland.  It had been a dream of Ford's since the 1930s to do a film in his ancestral home showing all the idealized life and mannerisms that Ford saw in Irish customs and traditions.  While they are highly over emphasized, in Ford's Ireland, everyone drinks, sing songs and goes fishing while strictly observing their Catholic faith, at least when in sight of the ever present parish priest who is the story teller of the movie.Our all Irish cast features John Wayne as the American Sean Thornton who comes home to forget his troubled past and the always beautiful red headed Maureen O'Hara (who was 31 at the time) as the single farm lass Mary Kate Danaher, along with Ward Bond (parish priest), Victor McLaglen (the Squire), Mildred Natwick (the Widow) and Barry Fitzgerald (busybody and matchmaker).  The rest of the casting was a case study in nepotism; besides the presence of Ford's brother Francis (Dan Tobin), Maureen O'Hara's two brothers Charles (Hugh Forbes) and James (Fr. Paul) were both pictured, along with Barry Fitzgerald's brother Arthur (Rev Playfair).  Even John Wayne's four children have a part with Maureen O'Hara on the day of the races and his makeup man, Webb Overlander, plays the role of the stationmaster.  For John Ford the film was the fulfillment of a dream commenting, ""I was all choked up at leaving our beloved Ireland and I was afraid that I would burst into tears, which I did on reaching my berth...Galway is in my blood and the only place I have found peace.""The film is shot along the border of County Mayo and Galway, in northwestern Ireland, and is a wonderful look at the scenic beautiful and simplicity of the backcountry that is Ireland even today.  This beauty is evident in the natural conditions of the countryside shown during the film; also there are no special effects creating the winds, rains and the ever-present cloud cover in many of the scenes.  While the film is supposed to be set in about the 1920s and shot in 1951, the landscape still looks very much the same today as then.Sadly, both of these DVDs are no better than a copy from a VHS tape and the quality suffers.  Why this timeless film was never remastered properly for DVD production is an unknown and a sorry way to treat what has become a classic movie.  The beauty that is evident in this film would be simply stunning in HD or Blu-Ray.  Buy the movie by all means for the beauty of Ireland and a John Ford classic film (5 Stars) but never pay full price for it under any circumstances until it is properly remade (3 stars).Readers of this review are invited to comment below or by email as listed in my profile."	4.0	John Ford Returns Home	2009-07-08	5	5	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A32CY1SIECVT9I	James H. Wilson	When my good wife gave me a DVD player for Christmas my first thought was, &quot;I'll have to buy a DVD of &quot;The Quiet Man.&quot;  My comments will be maudlin because this movies is my all-time favorite.I think that 100 years form now John Ford will be seen as the best American Director of the 20th century.  In his movie, &quot;The Quiet Man,&quot; we see John Ford dreaming of an Ireland that, like Shangra-La, exists as an image of a perfect place.  He assembled John Wayne and a magnificent Irish cast to present a wonderful tale of two people trying to get together accross a huge cultural gap.  In &quot;The Quiet man&quot; we have the beautiful Maureen O'Hara, the tale's narrator, Ward Bond, and the real-life brothers, Arthur Shields and Barry Fitzgerald.  The protagonist of the story is Victor McLaglin who refuses to give his consent to the marriage of Wayne and O'Hara.  Everyone in this movie is a little jewel who displays their human side and thier finer sides.All through the movie we know that a climactic fight is coming between John Wayne (who had many homeric movie fights including &quot;The Spoilers&quot; and &quot;McKlintoch&quot;) and Victor McLaglin (who also pummled movie foes in films like &quot;Gunga Din&quot; and &quot;What Price Glory&quot;).  I think that one of the neatest movie moments for me is the second before the fight Maureen O'Hara gives us a look that lets us know that all through the film Wayne has chased her until she caught him.&quot;The Quiet Man&quot; is a perfect piece of film making by the great John Ford.  Everyone ought to have a favorite film and I share mine with millions who love it too.  I recommend it to people who like films, are romantic, like John Wayne or any others in the cast.  I recommend it to people who seek a little Shangra-La.	5.0	John Ford, John Ford and John Ford	2002-08-12	0	0	0

The video does not fill up the entire TV screen, but it is exceptionally clear considering how long ago this movie was made.

It's not as clear as a movie made in the 21st Century would be, but it totally met my expectations.

Now along comes this magnificent Blu-ray edition of ""The Quiet Man.""The wonderful Technicolor never looked so striking. The mono soundtrack was never so crisp. In short, for folks who have adored this great movie for years, now you can view it over and over again in a format that captures the way it looked back in 1952 when it was first released."	5.0	Superb Entertainment, excellent Blu-ray.	2013-02-12	7	6	1

It teaches so much about the old Irish way of life: customs, songs, etc. The photography from the Emerald Isle alone makes this show worth seeing.John Wayne plays an American boxer who has come to Ireland, the land of his ancestors, to escape his past. He had accidentally killed an opponent during a boxing match, and vowed never to fight again because of it.He marries a local woman. But all is not well. She resents the fact that he won't challenge her brother for the dowry. He doesn't think that it is important. She certainly does! In time, she, and others, not realizing the motives behind his non-combative spirit, increasingly see him as a coward.Her contempt for his apparent lack of a sense of honor becomes so great that she prepares to leave him. So what will he do? Hint: What would a John Wayne movie, whether a western or not, be without a good fight?	5.0	A Tough Guy Mistaken for a Coward	2007-12-22	4	3	1
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A34OXGWAC1XBOY	"Jay Gregg ""Geology professor"""	"""The Quiet Man"" is my favorite movie. I must have watched it 50 times and I never tire of it. True, the portrayal of Ireland and the Irish people is something of a caricature and the movie does exaggerate some of the aspects of life in Ireland. But I really think, having lived in Ireland for a year and having traveled there many times, that John Ford does capture something of the soul of the island and it's people. Counties Galway and Mayo are, if anything, even more beautiful than what Ford captured on film. The people of rural Ireland are every bit as open and friendly as he depicts. However, ""The Quiet Man"" portrays an Ireland that may be fading away as the nation is no longer an impoverished backwater of Europe, from which it's sons must emigrate to seek their fortunes. Today it is the economic ""Celtic tiger"" to which its &eacute;migr&eacute;s are returning. Some things do not change though. In the opening scene of ""The Quiet Man"" John Wayne is given ""directions"" to Innisfree that involve everything but how to actually get to Innisfree. In 1993, during my first trip to Ireland, I was given the same kind of ""directions"" while wandering the streets of Dublin!"	5.0	The Real Ireland?	2001-08-25	3	1	2

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2LVPKJI7ABVT6	jdjensen	"I saw this movie for the first time in 1975 at the age of 22 and immediately fell in love with Maureen O'Hara. Since then, I have bought several versions for my home theater, including the first VHS and the Collectors Edition DVD. All of them were huge disappointments. The video quality was so poor that it was painful to watch, even on a small TV. I have been waiting for a decent transfer for years. Finally, Olive Films has delivered a blu-ray version that is much better than any of the predecessors. It is a pleasure to watch on a big screen. By the way, my equipment is an OPPO BDP-93 blu-ray player, a Panasonic PT-AE4000U HD projector and a 150"" screen. True, being a non-native English speaker I miss the subtitles. I also miss the commentary by Maureen O'Hara. Of, course, there are ways and means to get around these problems, but this is not the time and place to discuss such issues. Furthermore, I am not sure that I would call it a perfect transfer, because there are still some minor issues, mostly in badly lit interior scenes. A couple of outdoor scenes seem to be overexposed, because especially the faces appear too light. But as a whole, the picture quality is really amazing. Some of the scenes are are so crisp and fresh that it is like being in Ireland yourself. So, while waiting for The Quiet Man to get the ultimate Criterion TLC treatment, this is a good choice.I am not going to talk about the movie itself in any great detail. Others have done that much more eloquently than I can. But it was only now, watching it in high-definition on a big screen, that I realised that this is first and foremost Maureen O'Haras movie. She has the best scenes and some of the best lines, and the camera clearly loves her.

As someone else said, the VHS tape has better quality.  What was even more disturbing to me is something I just discovered.  It shows the ""CC"" symbol for closed captioning and also spells it out in the special features block on the back of the case.  When a hearing impaired friend recently wanted to watch it and needed the captions they were not there.  We tried for over an hour to find a way to get them to display and if they are on the DVD the link to them is broken.  Under the Audio category off of the main menu they are not listed.  How an outfit like Artisian ever got hold of a classic movie like this one I don't know.

In fact, to the place where much of The Quiet Man was filmed, Cong, County Mayo. At the time, was born in me a fire for my heritage and home, this movie captures the traditions of the people and essence of what was Ireland. This is a mystical journey of a poor and proud people, their country and what is important to their lives. I wish that today's Ireland was the same as it was in the movie. This is my number one movie of all time, it takes me home.

Lovins ""Mr. Jim"""	"Republic Pictures presents ""THE QUIET MAN"" (1952) - (125 min/Color) -- Starring: John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Barry Fitzgerald, Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen & Mildred NatwickDirected by John FordIrish-American boxer John Wayne, recovering from the trauma of having accidentally killed a man in the ring, arrives in the Irish village where he was born. Hoping to bury his past and settle down to a life of tranquility, Wayne has purchased the home of his birth from wealthy local widow Mildred Natwick, a transaction that has incurred the wrath of pugnacious squire Victor McLaglen, who coveted the property for himself. By and by, Wayne falls in love with McLaglen's beautiful, high-spirited sister Maureen O'Hara. Her insistence that Wayne conduct his courtship in a proper Irish manner-with puckish matchmaker Barry Fitzgerald along for the ride as ""chaperon""--is but one obstacle to their future happiness: the other is McLaglen, who spitefully refuses to give his consent to his sister's marriage, or to honor the tradition of paying a dowry to Wayne. Wayne could care less about dowries, but the tradition-bound Maureen refuses to consummate her marriage until McLaglen pays up.The Perfect Movie Experience, there has never been another like it.Special footnote: -- Barry Fitzgerald is the brother of actor Arthur Shields, with whom he performed in several films, most notably John Ford's The Quiet Man (1952).Oscar Winner for Best Director & Best Color CinematographyOscar Nominations for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Victor McLaglen), Screenplay, Sound Recording & Art Direction.BIOS:1.

This movie is one, in my humble opinion, of that time when movies were well done, with plots and traditional values. Now we, what ever... This movie stars two of the best John Wayne and  Maureen O'Hara. The scenes, done in Scotland (I think) are beautiful.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A246DPGDMYPQ0K	J. Ocampo	John Wayne, like most of us, had a space in his heart for the joys of the fabled Emerald Isle.It was one of his personal projects to star in this film and capture the spirit of old Ireland, and capture it he did.This film features every element of the Irish fable; stern yet caring parish preists, picturesque stone houses, quick witted old men, beer guzzling brawlers, charming green fields, and beautiful redheaded maidens.  They all come alive to create a complete and stunningly pleasurable movie.Like life in Ireland itself, the movie has a little of everything, comedy, romance, tragedy, and a good old Irish brawl for fun.John Wayne, though best known for his westerns, did very well as the ex-boxer Sean Thornton, who returned to the country of his birth to start a new life.  Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) is the Irish damsel that captures his heart, and Will Danaher is her jealous brother who will do everything he can to stand in the way of their romance.John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara create a splendid dynamic as Sean tries to convince Mary Kate that he is the right man for her.  It's quite fun to see their relationship unfold.This is the kind of movie that will cheer you up.  Maybe you aren't interested in the long Irish brawl near the end of the film, but what can be more pleasurable to the eye than the beautiful Maureen O'Hara and the stunningly green Irish landscape?If you are interested in seeing two stars interact with each other, that's another reason to watch this one.If you've been bit by the Irish bug, or simply yearn for a film that fun and uplifting, then you can't go wrong with The Quiet Man.	5.0	The joy of fabled Old Ireland.  4  Stars	2006-09-14	2	1	1

It is a movie that has all the right elements in it, comedy, a touch of drama, great acting and beautiful Ireland, what else could you ask for?  John Wayne plays a man  running from his past by travelling to Ireland, his boyhood home.  In the  tiny village he encounters Mary Kate Danaher portrayed excellently by the  beautiful Maureen O'Hara, and talk about a stormy relationship they have in  the movie! Wow! Its like two thunderstorms colliding.  Barry Fitzgerald is  great in the movie playing Wayne's friend, and Victor McLaglen is  outstanding portraying Wayne's arch rival and O'Hara's brother Red Danaher.  From beginning to end it is a captivating and charming movie.  A crowning  achievement to John Ford's impressive directing career.	5.0	A gem of a movie	2000-06-05	8	6	2
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A29ESP2JO916A6	joessmithy	After reading other reviews and paying special attention to Alexis Ray's (the first review in the list) suggestion about which DVD to get I bought the Collector's Edition. At first I thought that maybe I got a pirated copy, as if someone had video taped their TV while this movie played off a VHS tape. Other reviewers thought that the transfer to digital was satisfactory, I disagree. Bright colors bled into whites. The whites were harsh. Movement was blurry. I tried adjusting several display factors with some success, but have never had to make any adjustments with any other DVD. The quality of this product is just so poor. I couldn't watch the whole movie, it was giving me a headache. Amazon makes returns easy, so that's what I did and will receive a refund. I look forward to possible remastered and even restored version of this film.

It is in NTSC format but I have had other DVDs that have been much better (not as good as PAL). I was looking forward to the glorious scenery however it was not to be. I deliberately bought the ""Collectors Edition"" as one of the reviewers said the quality in the ""John Wayne Collection"" was poor. It hasn't been digitally enhanced and must be played in the 4:3 format which is outdated these days. This film was described as a ""silly little Irish film"" and was only made after the financier was given a promise to make Rio Grande first so that he had the money to make this film. Nobody else was interested in financing the picture because it was expected to make a loss."	1.0	Nice picture but poor quality	2008-05-25	6	4	2

He returns back to Ireland, his original hometown where he can forget all his troubles and settle for a new life in the town where he was raised. He falls for a lovely maiden named Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara) as they soon later fall in love with each other and conducts his courtship thanks to a impish matchmaker (Barry Fitzgerald), but her brother (Victor McLaglen) refuses to have them together even though Mary Kate and Sean later gets married, is that Sean has to pay him and that he knows about his dark past.A wonderful and sometimes humorous glimpse to old Ireland thanks to director John Ford. This is a compelling romantic comedy-drama that has heart, great acting especially by John Wayne who is flawless as usual and the why this was actually filmed in Ireland was amazing especially the writing and direction. This film went on to become very successful and earned two academy awards especially for best cinematography, this is a real winner of a movie that is a must see especially for John Wayne fans.This DVD contains very good remastered picture and sound with some quality extras like cast and crew info, ""The Making of the Quiet Man"" Featurette with Leonard Maltin, The Joys of Ireland documentary, Remembering The Quiet Man Montage, production notes, both original restored audio and enchanched original restored audio, Trailers to this and other Artisan/Lion's Gate releases and commentary by Maureen O'Hara."	5.0	A masterpiece!	2008-03-29	4	3	1

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AQ7V1UO19U1N9	John Rossi	Okay, here we go. I've loved all things Irish for several years now, and this film quickly joined the ranks of my favorites even though I was not expecting it to, but there you have it. After all, I mostly knew John Wayne courtesy of old Western movies, and usually I don't like those kinds of things. This movie taught me to take another look at  things I may not like and give them a chance. I grew QUICKLY to LOVE this movie. What else can I say? The location photography in Ireland is lovely. The DVD transfer undoubtedly helps this. It lets you see Ireland alive in all her resplendent glory, the way God intended her to be seen. The music is lively in some places and poignant in many as well. The little touches like men almost constantly singing in the bar and during the wedding sequence, to me captured greatly just how deeply music and song is embedded in the hearts, souls and blood of Ireland's people.Then there is the humor and warmth. Plenty of genuinely funny moments (such as a priest battling so passionately  to catch a fish, the &quot;bed-breaking&quot; moment and many more), and warmth. Wayne's character is made welcome almost instantly upon coming to Ireland to escape his inner demons. Welcome, that is by all people except one.I'd like to touch on something here. To me, the romance and love story in this was done brilliantly. It is passionate and romantic without being lewd or explicit. Also, to me in some places it's downright funny (Mr. Flynn trying to be suave when talking to Mary Kate about Sean when he's clearly drunk, and in trying to make sure that Sean and Mary Kate behave themselves later on). It may seemed rushed to some, but not to me. After all that IS how courting in Ireland and many places used to be done.So there you have it. A beautiful-looking film that is acted splendidly. There is music to touch the ears and soul  and the heart as well with joy and longing and beauty. There is nice sweet romance without lewd things cluttering it up. And, lest we forget, all this is capped by one of the best donnybrooks (a massive and often hillarious fistfight between Sean Thornton and &quot;Red&quot; Will Danaher) that was ever caught on film.Well, what else can I tell you. I love this. Give it a chance, you just might love it too. Peace, and God bless you and yours, always.	5.0	Heart, humor, and warmth, I love it.	2003-08-02	4	3	1

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A5CUD8L6JG3QH	John Smith	"An Open Letter to the Executives at Paramount Pictures:As this is the month of March and St. Patrick's Day is upon us, it would be a great gift to not only Irish Americans and John Wayne fans, but to film lovers the world over to know that Paramount is dedicated to working to release a proper high-definition Blu-ray transfer of this magnificent and beautiful film. Fans of the movie, such as myself, have been limited to watching sub-standard and hastily-transferred DVD and VHS editions of this movie since its initial home release about 30 years ago. Washed out colors, dirt spots, and a host of other issues plauge just about every release of the film, regardless of medium. Other John Wayne pictures of the period have received beautiful restorations and been released on Blu-ray to be enjoyed in their original glory, yet ""The Quiet Man"" remains just that. Of all the older films that would benefit from a restoration, ""The Quiet Man"" would arguably have the most to gain. The lush, green, rolling hills of the Irish countryside deserve to been seen as Ford saw and captured them. Please give the film the respect and treatment it deserves, and help to release it in HD.

I have been a fan of this movie for over 40 years, and have owned it in every iteration of home media that has appeared from VHS tape to a number of editions of dvd -- I can say unequivocally that none of these prior releases can compare with this blu ray edition of The Quiet Man.  For the first time ever, interior scenes show the details that have always been lost in the shadows; the same is true for the scenes shot outdoors in the evening or the rain.  The clarity and vibrancy of the picture throughout the entire movie is simply phenomenal and the audio is crisp, clear and flawless.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3UBJC0XCXLJ86	J. Terry	The lead review of The Quiet Man DVD on Amazon intimates that there is a 'better' transfer available among the various versions out there.There is not. All official editions are of low, VHS-or-worse quality.Without question, this is the poorest video resolution of any officially released digital film transfer in my collection.Now, I treasure my laserdisc of The Uninvited (1944) as that's the best transfer available - DVDs that are offered online are unofficial dubs which have received mixed reviews regarding quality. Those who are pleased with the dub just seem happy to have it at all because you can make out fairly well what is going on and it is a beloved movie to many. Sort of like watching the Time Machine on Chicago's WGN program Family Classics during the 1960s. Hacked to pieces, riddled with commercials and the top third of the screen flagging to one side (our TV's fault - not the station!). But family, friends and the pizza were great and we loved that movie.A very muddy, unofficial DVD burned off a friend's taped TV broadcast of the 50s exploitation film 'The Hypnotic Eye' still holds a place of honor in my collection for the same reason. I'm not aware of anything better being available (UPDATE - A Remastered Warner Archives edition is on its way here! I was jazzed at first, but another reviewer states that the film has been oddly formatted to create a widescreen effect, losing a fair amount of what was in the film in the first place. We will report when this arrives and we compare the two editions.)The Quiet Man won two Academy Awards, nominated for seven, including one for Best Cinematography. The storybook, multiphase greens of Ireland juxtaposed against Maureen O'Hara's glorious complexion and red hair are among the most stunning images in twentieth century film - at least to hundreds of thousands of Hibernophiles. In addition to several other wins and nominations it was among the top ten high grossing films of that year. It remains one of the most beloved films in the U.S.By comparison, 'Fiend Without a Face' - you know the 1960 movie with the flying brain monsters that suck out your spinal fluid - was rejuvenated when Criterion gave it their wonderful treatment. This low-budget film made money at the box office but nothing like the millions generated by The Quiet Man.Now, many sources claim a restoration of The Quiet Man has already been done at the film school of UCLA. Whether or not this is true, how, in 2012 can this vastly more popular and successful film be unavailable in high resolution? Not even a word about possible release!I know there are bigger issues facing the world today. Indeed, from many of them I hoped to escape on this St Patrick's Day by pulling up a barstool with Michaeleen, Sean, Mary Kate, Red Will, Father Lonergan, the Reverend Mister Playfair and the rest of the inhabitants of the mythical Innisfree.But going back to the pixelated mess as it is, bleeding colours all over the place...just can't do it. Not even one more time.I guess it'll just have to be Draft Guinness and flying brain monsters again this year!	1.0	This review refers to all existing DVD editions of this classic film	2012-02-28	3	3	0

None of these little snippets of information.  What is also important is that classic film buffs we are finally getting some truly accurate information about the making of this film masterpiece - from someone who was there. We have indeed been blessed with the longevity of Maureen O'Hara.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A276YAD1NSV9LQ	J. Young	This is one of the best films of all time, and it needs a genuine restoration and loving remastering. While the Collector's Edition is blessed with the comments of Maureen O'Hara, both as an audio track and in a long featurette, someone apparently forgot to actually play the dvd before it was released to check the video quality. The print that ET was watching on TV while Eliot was in biology class looked better. The Republic VHS video has a very clear print off of the original negative. I was hoping this edition would improve on that or at least match it. But the video almost seems a little out of focus compared to the VHS tape. The west of Ireland really looks like that, by the way. The only false note in the film is the speed with which the barman was able to draw several pints of Guinness in a row, but otherwise the movie would have been half an hour longer.	4.0	Great movie; great extras; disappointing video quality--Artisan, phone home.	2007-04-01	3	2	1

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AYPS4RCXEFSJP	K. Boullosa	"This is my personal favorite among all John Ford's films. Presenting what is probably a rather romanticized image of an Ireland that I suspect never existed even 100 years ago, the film's visual beauty, interesting romantic dilemma, and wonderful performances, are nevertheless worth every minute of its slightly longish running time.  John Wayne is not one of my favorite actors and I can only go so far on the red-haired beauty of the admirably upholstered Maureen O'Hara.  However, as the conflicted, heartsore, regretful boxer Sean Thornton, who returns to his mother's natal village in Ireland, Innisfree, to find some peace and healing, Wayne strikes a nice if wooden balance between machismo and vulnerability.  O'Hara, as Mary Kate Danagher, the (sorry, there is no other word for it) fiery neighbor with whom Sean falls in love, provides for Wayne what can only be called a match made in Heaven: physically, temperamentally, intellectually, and spiritually - only culturally do Sean and Mary Kate suddenly find themselves at loggerheads.Sean travels to Innisfree to find solace after a terrible experience in the boxing ring.  He began life in Pittsburgh, where his mother emigrated, and spent his youth in the city's legendary steel mills, a purgatory from which his boxing talent eventually freed him.  But all his young life his mother filled Sean's mind with the beauty and peace of Innisfree and the pretty cottage she was born in, White O'Morn.  Now wealthy from his boxing career, but with a deadly secret heavy on his heart, Sean returns to his mother's village to buy back the family cottage, rediscover his roots, and achieve reconciliation with his own past.  It is Mary Kate Danagher who Sean spots the day he arrives in Inisfree, barefoot in the lush green grass as she tends her brother's sheep, red hair blowing in the wind.  For Sean, it is love at first sight.But Red Will Danagher (the formidable Victor MacLaglen in all his ham-fisted glory), also wants White O'Morn, as well as its owner, the genteel Widow Tulane, whose land lies so neatly next to his.  When Sean outbids Will for the cottage and its land, Danagher's volcanic ire fastens implacably on the Yank newcomer.As ill-luck would have it, Mary Kate is Will's younger sister, who keeps house for him.  Sean, to his dismay, soon finds out that in order to win Mary Kate, he must first conquer her irascible brother's hostility, because without her brother's consent Mary Kate cannot marry, or if she does, would forfeit her dowry.  The symbolic importance of a girl's dowry as she leaves her family home to found one of her own, the necessity for a local matchmaker to facilitate proceedings - all the small village's seemingly immutable mating customs puzzle and infuriate Sean.  Only slowly does Sean come to understand what Mary Kate feels when she says that if he doesn't have her dowry, he doesn't have any real bit of her, that she is ""still the servant I have always been.""  Reluctant as Sean is to use his fists again for what he thinks of as ""only money"", eventually he realizes that he will have to come to terms with his last fighting experience or lose any chance at happiness with Mary Kate.How Sean and Mary Kate and Red Will and the Widow Tulane, as well as a delightful supporting cast of characters (e.g., Barry Fitzgerald as the matchmaker and Ward Bond as the powerful village priest) find their way through this romantic and cultural tangle makes for a lovely, well-written, beautifully played two hours.  The exploration of different cultural expectations and misunderstandings is gentle and the custom of the dowry, and what it meant to a woman in such a culture freeing herself from girlhood obedience, provokes thought.  ""The Quiet Man"" is very much in a class by itself and shows all Ford's talent for marshalling exactly the right people in the right roles."	5.0	Irresistably Romantic Gaelic Culture Clash	2010-08-26	0	0	0

However the upside is that now that more and more classic movies are coming to blu-ray I will be able to enjoy them even more in full 1080p and can build the kind of library I have been wanting. The Quiet Man is one of these essentials. Just like in ""The Searchers"" the cinematography is absolutely stunning and the colors are vivid, and this was on the dvd. However, the picture quality and clarity was certainly not conducive to the movie and was a disappointment to say the least on the dvd. If they have put the care and time to transfer it to the blu-ray format that they did with ""The Searchers"" then I can't wait to see this the way that it was meant to be seen.

It's noticeable throughout, particularly when characters speak quickly.  I gave a 2 rating instead of 1 (but would prefer 1.5) because, although the transfer is not good, many of the shots retain their beauty - particularly the landscapes.  Where the problem arises is in the red and facial tones.  Terrible.  Still, the movie is so good, I laughed out loud many times.  ""Impetuous!

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2GPEV42IO41CI	Kona	"John Ford's ""The Quiet Man"" takes you to the beautiful Irish countryside for a romantic-comedy and slice of folksy life.  Sean Thornton (John Wayne) has left America and returned to Ireland to settle in his ancestral home.  On his first day, he sees the lovely spinster, Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara), and makes up his mind to marry her.  She's more than willing, but the local customs must be observed, and Sean courts her with the help of the local marriage broker (Barry Fitzgerald).  All goes well, until Mary Kate's brother Will refuses to pay her dowry.  She is shamed and ashamed of Sean for not answering Will's challenge to a fist fight.  No one knows that Sean once killed a man in the boxing ring and has vowed never to fight again.This is a lusty, entertaining movie thanks to the terrific chemistry and charisma of big John Wayne and spitfire Maureen O'Hara.  They are a perfect match and a joy to watch.  I didn't like Sean's manhandling of Mary Kate - I'm sure it was meant to be funny and earthy (it seemed barbaric to me).  But the scenery is lush and idyllic, the score is a merry collection of Irish folk tunes, and the feeling one gets from watching is that there would be no finer place on earth to live than the fairy tale village of Innisfree.Kona"	5.0	"""You can tell him, 'I go for it!'"""	2005-10-01	8	7	1

This may be the best movie that John Ford ever directed, as this is truly a masterpiece from start to finish. Filmed on location in Ireland, Ford used the beautiful green countryside to frame his story of a former boxer, Shawn Thornton (John Wayne) who leaves America for Ireland after he accidently kills another fighter in the ring.  Hating himself for pummeling his foe to death for the money purse, Shawn vows to never use his fists again.  In Ireland, Shawn buys his boyhood home in Innisfree, and simutanelusly incurs the rath of his neighbor, Will Danaher, who wanted the property himself.  Shawn quickly falls head over heels for the bewitching beauty of Mary Kate Danaher, Will Danaher's sister (Maureen O'Hara - in perhaps her best role).  Unfortunately for Thornton, Will Danaher refuses to give his sister in marriage to the man he despises.  Enter official matchmaker Michaleen Oge Flynn, who with the help of the local clergy, hatches a secret plot to get Will Danaher to give up his sister to Thornton.  Shawn and Mary Kate are finally married; however, there is one more problem, Mary Kate's brother Will refuses to deliver her 350 dollar dowry after he discovers he's been tricked.  Shawn, who hates money due to his boxing history, refuses to press the issue with Danaher, causing Mary Kate to think Shawn is a coward and does not care for her.  Mary Kate decides to leave her husband to shame him, and heads for the train station.  This is the last straw for Shawn and the end of his ""quiet-man"" ways.  The last 30 minutes of the film is an absolutely delightful, hillarious romp through the contryside, first to retrieve his wife, and second, to fight Mary Kate's brother for the dowry.  A marvelous finish it is.  Ford's genius is clearly evident in the humorous manner in which he wraps up this film.  I laughed until I cried!The movie's score is wonderfullly Irish (of course), and I guarantee you will be humming the various musical themes long after the movie is over.The character casting is excellent and unforgettable.  Wayne is superb as the American Yank Shawn Thornton, and O'Hara matches him scene for scene as the fiery and fiesty Mary Kate.  Their on-screen chemistry is obvious, and it is apparent both actors truly enjoy each others company and work.  The supporting cast is superb as well, with Ford gathering his ""family"" of actors around him to make ""The Quiet Man"" a movie you will never forget.  Barry Fitzgerald (as Michaleen Flynn), should have won an Oscar for his hilarious portrayal of the boozed-up mathchmaker.  Victor McLaglen as Will Danaher is equally gifted.Beautifully filmed, artistically directed, and wonderfully acted, ""The Quiet Man"" is pure and simple, a true gem of a film, and one you will want to watch again and again.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ	Larry Scantlebury	"Actually in a manner of speaking, this movie is an extraordinary success in spite of John Wayne. I love the Duke even when he acted out of character, as a detective or a deep sea diver. But he probably owed his presence in numerous films because of his presence in life. He was, odd as it may sound, larger than life. Being an actor was something he did almost as a hobby. Here, he is surrounded by capable actors, Fitzgerald, Bond, Maglaglen, O'Hara, Mildred Natwick whom you recognize from a hundred different roles. So that he 'hung in' with that crowd, is a credit to him, to his loyalty and to his friendship, to his joie vivre. But probably not his acting skill.Everyone knows the story. Trooper Thornton, an up and coming U. S. heavyweight, kills a contender in the ring by accident but all the while as he, Sean Thornton, is pursuing money. So he quits the ring and journeys home to Ireland where his Mother was born.Later he falls in love with Mary Kate Danaher (O'Hara), sister of the ill-tempered Will Danaher and probably equally foul tempered. All is well. There is a certain lust in the air between Wayne and O'Hara, at least as much as you can imagine in the 1950's. Three second kisses and not many of them. That's until Will, the big oaf, refuses to give Mary Kate her dowery and without it, she comes to Sean with nothing and hates herself and him for it. But to fight someone for money, which is what Mary Kate wants her husband to do, brings back the haunting shame Duke feels for killing a man in the ring.All the good lines go to Fitzgerald who tells Mary Kate, ""Ay. You have the tongue of an Adder,"" and later, when he sees the broken marital bed not knowing that Sean threw Mary Kate in it and left in contempt of her mercenary wishes to sleep on the floor, Fitzgerald says, ""Homeric!""It's a great great movie that most of us have seen 25 times and still get a good feeling over. Don't believe the careful analysis and scrutiny of some reviewers. Well photographed, a lot of laughs, no sex and no killing. Can you believe it? 5 stars.

It tells the story of an American, coming home to his mother's beloved Irland. There he meets and  falls in love with a beautiful colleen, only to find that her brother is  against the affair and basically, out to get him.  Shot on location in  Ireland, the view is gorgeous, and the plot has everything from exciting  fights to tender love scenes. ( My favourite scene is their famous first  kiss, when he kisses her in the storm and then she slaps him. Btw, Maureen  O'Hara fractured her wrist doing that!)&quot;The Quiet Man&quot; was  John Ford's favourite film, and also his most personal one. He cast his  favourite actors in it, and it shows. John wayne is just great -whoever  thinks he only played himself in every role should see his performance  here. For his love interest we have Ford's kind of a woman, the  breathtakingly beautiful Maureen O'Hara.She gives a magnificent performance  as Mary Kate, and in my opinion should have won the Oscar for it. (She  Wasn't even nominated!) Sparks flew when this couple met on screen, and the  result is out there for you to witness.Don't wait till the next St.  Patrick's Day -see this film now.

He meets Kate (Maureen O'Hara) and love sparks fly in that old fashioned way you don't find in new movies anymore.  The commentary features Maureen O'Hara telling all the little tidbits that you would never have otherwise known about during production, like family members in the cast, being dragged through sheep droppings, and other stories of  the brilliant directing from John Ford.  The DVD edition is not the same video and audio quality you would get from a movie made today but that is overlooked when you get pulled into the story and especially after you watch the commentary section.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3TMR5FI9TQDQ1	"Leon W. Blocker ""Hoss"""	I am not sure why Amazon saw fit to lump all the DVD reviews in with the Blu-Ray version, but that's neither here nor there for the purposes of this review. What is to the point, at least from my perspective, is this Blu-ray version is the anti-DVD. The claim is this Blu-ray of The Quiet Man comes from a 4K scan of an original print. I can say this is very much the truth, and what it means for you is it will feel like you are there when you watch it.The quality is both the best and worst that technology has to offer. When I read the claim of a 4K scan my first thought was but one word : overkill. It wasn't until roughly 1970 that movie film had enough 'grain' that - more or less - it matched what later became the HD standard we all know today. That being said, the 4K scan put absolutely the maximum amount of resolution that will ever be possible to obtain from an original print of The Quiet Man. The only way to get better from this point is to process the 4K scan via software and somehow auto-magically remove the grain.Sadly, this means the images on your HD television will both be the highest resolution of The Quiet Man you have ever seen, and 'grainy' at the same time. In other words, don't expect to sit close to your HD TV expecting to ferret out minute details you never noticed before. You WILL see the grain of the original film coming through at all times.Assuming you are not sitting within eighteen inches of your HD TV, what you WILL see is the most beautiful, vibrant and beautiful movie that is possible at this point. There are details that were never possible to see with the slipshod 'transfers' that have been made up to now with VHS and DVDs. I have a VHS of a taping from TV and one of the DVDs, so  I know of whence I speak when I say :If you are a fan of The Quiet Man and you have yet to purchase the Blu-ray version, you are missing out.Isn't that the best possible reason to purchase this Blu-ray version? I am so glad I purchased it, because it was like watching a The Quiet Man for the very first time, all over again. I really can't think of a higher complement than that.The bottom line is if you don't add The Quiet Man Blu-ray to your collection, more is the pity for you.	5.0	Quiet Man Blu-ray is Outstanding !	2014-03-19	4	4	0

Otherwise, this John Ford movie is a-one!John Wayne stars as an American-bred Irish-born man who has decided to return to the land of his birth for a mysterious reason. He certainly has a jammed-pack first day in town: He meets a gnome-like matchmaker who becomes his best friend (Barry Fitzgerald, best professional Irishman in Hollywood); spies a red-headed beauty on the hillside, soon to be his wife (frequent co-star Maureen O'Hara), and makes an enemy (Victor McLaglen), over a parcel of land. The enemy unfortunately happens to be the brother of that red-haired beauty. John and Maureen have a hard time getting married, due to that angry brother of hers, but just when you might think they've solved their problem, said brother refuses to provide Maureen with her dowry. John doesn't realize it at first, but in this sociological group, that means she won't consider herself married, and if she's not married, well, he can just forget about ever sleeping in that big double bed with her. Situation is resolved as you might expect, complete with a donnybrook of a fight between Wayne and McLaglen, just after the mysterious secret is divulged for the audience's benefit.The film stars the usual stable of performers used by Ford: Wayne, O'Hara, McLaglen, Fitzgerald, Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, and Arthur Shields (the real-life brother of Barry Fitzgerald, here playing the Protestant minister). Actors comfortable with their director can do a wonderful job, and that's what we have here. The other stand-out in ""The Quiet Man"" is the lush cinematography, which won a well-deserved Oscar. That scene when Wayne sees O'Hara for the first time is a knock-out, with her red hair showing off gloriously in technicolor.Although I did give this movie 4 stars, I do have my reservations about it:At the end of the movie, John Wayne pulls Maureen O'Hara out of a train station, and proceeds to drag her over the field (literally) back home to their town, where he confronts Victor McLaglen, saying that since there's been no dowry, there's no marriage, and he can have his sister back.  After the money issue is resolved, Maureen tells Wayne that she'll be going home to get dinner ready, and strides off with a smile on her face. The message: When a woman displays too much independence, it is her husband's right to brutalize her until she capitulates. In fact, this is what she really wants him to do, anyway. It's also worth noting that the violence takes place after they have consummated their marriage.  Before that, the Wayne character was very tender in his treatment of O'Hara. Now that she's his possession, however, he doesn't have to bother with that.This obviously misogynist development spoils what would have been a perfect film. I remember my dad told me that my grandmother had liked this film in the movie theatre until that dragging scene, which infuriated her, causing her to exclaim that no Irishwoman would ever put up with such treatment. I must confess that I felt anger myself looking at it. But it goes beyond Irishwomen; no woman anywhere should be subjected to abuse and degradation. I wish I had the power to alter the movie's ending, so that scene could have been rewritten.My final comment? Despite providing us with a disturbing look into Ford's attitudes toward women and how to relate to them as equals, ""The Quiet Man"" is a beautifully filmed movie that shows us a verdant Ireland with an unusually strong cast."	4.0	Great, but with one serious reservation...	2002-09-01	10	5	5

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1VFZ3GUUNQVPN	Linda Williams	I gave &#34;The Quiet Man&#34; a five-star rating because it shows a different side of John Wayne, whose normal movie genre is westerns.  This movie shows a mature actor with a wide range of talent; he is at different times thoughtful, funny, loving, and angry; there's plenty of action, too, although perhaps not the type one might expect.  I would recommend &#34;The Quiet Man&#34; to anyone who loves &#34;The Duke&#34; and his movies; they will certainly not be disappointed!	5.0	A favorite John Wayne movie	2013-10-02	0	0	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3G0LJZ6MJ5O9F	Lucyred	I can't begin to say how wonderful the Blu-Ray version of this wonderful movie is.  I have always loved this movie.  It was a tradition with my mother and I to watch this every year on St. Patrick's day.  My mom has sadly passed away a long time ago, but I still watch it every St. Patrick's day in her honor.  I went to Ireland last summer, and visited a little village called Cong where this movie was filmed.  When I came back I watched The Quiet man again to see all of the wonderful places I visited in that little village, and how so many things still look the same.  What I also realized however is that the quality of the movie was very grainy, and it was hard to get a true feeling of the beauty I saw in Ireland.  When this version came out, I purchased it right away, hoping it would do to this movie what Blu-Ray remastering did to one of my other all time favorites, The Sound Of Music.  Well, lets say I was blown away.  It is so worth the upgrade to be played on an HD TV and a Blu-ray player.  When watching it, it truly made me feel that I was back in that lovely village of Cong again.  The images and scenery were like when I was there last summer.  The green really pops, but it really does when you are there as well.  I know after visiting Ireland that that is why they are know as the Emerald Isle.  Well, I just wanted to say how happy I was with this version, and what a great job they did remastering a wonderful classic.  The only thing I would add is that I wish they would have included the commentary from Maureen O'Hara in the edition I have.  I really enjoyed listening to her comments on the making of the movie, and all of the special things she had to say about her co-stars and director.  That is why I am keeping that version as well.  They should think of adding that back into this one, and it would be complete.  Enjoy.	5.0	Outstanding remastering of a wonderful classic	2013-03-10	7	6	1

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	ARX7Z3NI6O0F7	Lynn May	"It's too bad Amazon has lumped all of the Quiet Man reviews onto each versionof this movie.  They are not all the same that's for certain.The Blu-Ray edition that I am rating is the very best that I have seen so far and I'vehad both DVD versions before the 60th anniversary and now the blu-ray.I only gave the blu-ray four stars as this is not the best restoration that I haveseen released on blu-ray disc.  There are several frames where damage orcolor fringing has not been removed or restored.  You'll notice the color fringingon very high contrast frames especially in the beginning of the movie where ""Sean Thornton""and ""Mary Kate"" first see each other as she is herding sheep.It's red fringing or Chromatic aberration.  There is a bit of green fringing fromtime to time, but it's hardly noticeable.There is also a large bright spot to the very right edge middle of the frame whenMr Flinn and Sean Thornton are walking across the glen to Thornton's newlypurchased cottage.  It stays in the image for a long time and I can't believe theymissed correcting it.  It occurs again during a later frame I believe with ""Mary Kate"",but I can't remember the specific frame.Reds are severely over saturated in this movie and I made corrections accordinglyon my TV.  I know it's not my television as I have calibrated it and other blu-raymovies have near perfect image quality on it.If you are a stickler for image quality as I am and you have a nice quality TVthen I encourage you to make adjustments for this movie and write them down.I have a Samsung 42"" and here are the adjustments that I made:Try going into your TVs menu and find the equivalent of Picture Mode.I chose Dynamic and then these settings:Backlight:  10 ( and that is low on the scale)Contrast:  70Brightness:  35Sharpness:  45Color:  45Tint:  G53/R47Picture Options:Color Tone :  CoolDigital Noise Filter :  HighMPEG  Noise Filter :  HighThese may or may not help depending on yourTV, but at least you might get an idea of what tweakingyou can do.  I wrote mine down and put a copy in themovie case, so I can quickly tweak the settings and enjoythe movie that much faster.I chose Dynamic as this movie was filmed in Technacolor and thecolors really popped in the original.  I tried other viewing versionsin my TV menu, but they just didn't have the color match for thefilm.  Some people will say that is the reason for the fringing, etc,but I tried in the less dynamic modes and you not only get the sameissues, but less color quality.  You be the judge of your own viewingexperience.The Blu-ray version really is a Much better version that anything out there,but I had high hopes for this edition and I got the feelingas many have in the past that the Wayne family doesn't want toput much effort/money into the Wayne movies being restored.That ""just get by"" attitude really shows in the quality of therestorations.  I do photography work.  I have only read up onhow much time and effort it takes to restore video, but reallyif you are going to do it why not just do it right.This is an incredible movie and for some of us it is also of historicalvalue.  This Ireland is gone for ever, except where it's captured in video.I hope this review helps others to make an informed decision before buying.You wont regret this Blu-Ray version.  I know they released a regular DVD60th version, but I have not seen it.Good luck and I hope you enjoy the Quiet Man on Blu-Ray as most of us havenever before seen it.My movie was purchased from Amazon, but I received it as a gift."	4.0	Review for Quiet Man BLU-RAY Edition	2013-01-27	10	8	2

American icon John Ford's love hymn to the land of his ancestors deserves more respect than has been accorded it. On the plus side, the extras on the disk--which are listed under DVD Features, so there's no point in my reiterating them--are informative and enjoyable.A must-see film, but it deserves to be seen in all its glory."	4.0	My Thoughts Exactly	2005-09-13	7	6	1
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A4SY5RCGC5CH9	"Maciej ""Darth Maciek"""	"Although the image quality on this DVD is disappointing, I guarantee that after a couple of minutes you will forget it and focus easily on the movie itself. ""The Quiet man"" is one of John Ford's masterpieces and this great director deservedly received Oscar of best director in 1952 for this movie. ""The Quiet man"" was also nominated for the best picture, but lost to ""The greatest show on earth"" of Cecil B. de Mille. ""The Quiet man"" is a real treat, packing incredible fun, extremely well interpreted and so gentle and tender that it leaves after viewing a warm feeling in the heart.To avoid spoilers, let's just say what is showed in the first minutes of the movie - an Irish emigrant, Sean Thornton (John Wayne), after spending years in USA comes back to Ireland, to settle and enjoy in peace the money he made working across the ocean. When looking for a house and a piece of land to buy he notices a gorgeous local girl Mary Kate Danaher (the magnificent Maureen O'Hara). Mary Kate is probably the most beautiful woman in the whole county, but at past 30 she is still single because of her incredible temper, backed by a venomous tongue and easily used fast and strong fists (and claws!). Instantly thunderstruck, Thornton starts courting her with the most honorable intentions.But things of course can never be that simple and even a peaceful Irish village can become the scene of the most homeric dramas, especially considering that Thornton has some secrets in his past... And then Mary Kate's gigantic, brutish, foul mouthed and permanently angry older brother ""Red"" Will Danaher takes an instant dislike to the newcomer... ""Red"" Will is played here by Victor Mclaglen, a very interesting personage and an old friend of John Ford. McLaglen won an Oscar for main leading role in 1935 for his incredible performance in ""The informer"", and this role in ""The quiet man"" got him his second nomination, for best supporting role. He did not get it this time, but he should have!All the three main actors give here an extremely touching performance - and even if you dislike John Wayne, well, I think after viewing this movie, you may change your mind...This movie has many charms: actors, music, scenery, dialogs, but one of the most important is that it is TOTALLY POLITICALLY INCORRECT!! Especially any feminist watching this movie will probably find herself in danger of lethal heart attack or at least a seizure...))) Also, if you dislike Christians and especially clergy (both catholic and protestant), you will NOT like this movie. Me, being a devoted papist, I loved the Christian message of this movie greatly as well as the personage of local priest, as fanatically devoted to fishing trouts as to fight against Satan and all his works...))))I saw this movie many times and every time it made my laugh out loud and it left me feel warm, happy and peaceful in my heart. I really hope you will like it too."	5.0	A movie so funny and so good, that you can forgive the low quality of image	2012-04-02	1	1	0

My wife and I look forward to sharing it every St. Patrick's Day along with her fine Shepherd's Pie and a Guinness (or two). The characters in this film are incredible and the effort that John Ford made to secure the rights to the film and then prepare for the film are legendary.  In fact, Ford even went to the great extent of making a few films under the studio's budget mixing actors he had in mind for ""His"" Quiet Man before eventually making the film on his own. He wanted to be sure that all of them would mix well on the long journey in Ireland.  We know most of the lines in the film by heart now.  We eventually went to Ireland in 2000 and fell in love with the people and the country. We plan to go back again and retrace the film locations of this truly wonderful film.  A film like this makes one want to live in a time and place such as this....Respectfully,Mark"	5.0	Quiet Man	2014-03-23	0	0	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2KI1SGCZT2OEI	"Mark E. Stenroos ""Sibelius fan"""	"I placed my order for this 60th-Anniversary BluRay on Nov. 5, 2012, to be sure to have it delivered on its release date. I'm happy to report that amazon delivered the film on that release date (1/22/13).""The Quiet Man"" is one of those classic films that can be loved and enjoyed on many levels. The story, the acting, the humor, the cinematography, the musical score - it's all been there through the years.What hasn't been there to enjoy has been a truly exceptional print of the movie. I've seen this movie many times on TV. I've owned it on both VHS and DVD. All of those sources fell short in the visual presentation of the movie. Overly dark, indistinct, lacking in depth and detail. One had to be content with the story and acting to carry the day (though never having seen the film in a theater or in its premiere release condition, I can't be sure what this film looked like when it first played on the big screen).That situation has been addressed in spades in this new transfer to BluRay. The picture is steady as a rock. Details are amazingly clear. Colors are natural, with great contrasts and consistency (though some reviewers more knowledgeable than I have remarked on there being registration issues). I am particularly happy that Olive has avoided the opportunity to brighten up this film artificially to make things ""pop"" with a 21st-century sensibility. The film retains the darkish quality it has always had (which I assume is close to Ford's vision, or perhaps reflects the fact that the shoot was plagued by rain much of the time), but the transfer technique employed - one can't really call this a full out ""restoration"" of the film - has done its magic within the confines of the original film's palette. The play of light on faces is exceptionally well done, especially when those faces tended toward being blurred in earlier formats. It's simply a joy to watch scenes one knows intimately come to life with a nuance that hasn't been seen in decades, and that could have been missed in less-capable hands.Having said that, I can't help imagining that a full-out restoration of the film would yield an even better final product. I've never seen this movie in a theater, and I have no idea what constitutes the optimum visual presentation of this particular film, but I don't think that the Olive version will be the final stop in this film's journey back to optimum condition (are you listening, Criterion?)Victor Young's musical score and the dialogue come through nicely. Background noise has been reduced (not eliminated) from previous issues, but not so much as to sound artificial or clipped. I usually pay particular attention to soundtrack restoration on older films, and while that of ""The Quiet Man"" isn't the revelation of, say, the soundtrack for the BD of ""The Maltese Falcon,"" I will say that within a few minutes of watching QM, I had ceased my critical listening, and found myself sitting back and enjoying the film in all its aspects.One caveat - there are no subtitles on this disc, a minus when considering that there is an audience of the hard of hearing who should get some consideration when films are released on BD. For that matter, subtitles might also help decipher some of the dialogue that's delivered in those wonderful - and heavy - Gaelic accents!I can't recommend this BD highly enough. If you know and love this film, you'll be in heaven viewing this transfer.If you don't know this film, I can think of no better way to make its acquaintance.5 stars."	5.0	An Exceptional Transfer on BD	2013-01-23	10	9	1

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AAYE34TCTNV2R	MarlowesMom	"Bash away.  ""The Quiet Man"" is sentimental, picture-postcard, shamrock-y claptrap. It's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's just hokey, embarrassing and insulting and condescending toward the Irish. Aren't they picturesque, and aren't their primitive ways just ever so too-too? Marion Morrison aka John Wayne, always a bizarre and to me repulsive screen presence with his awkward combination of machismo and limp-wristedness, never could act his way out of a paper bag. The rest of the actors, talking like Lucky Charms leprechauns so Americans will believe they are Irish but be able to understand them, play it all as broadly as a cartoon even though their work in other venues makes it clear they could do better. Best director for John Ford for this effort? I think maybe the Academy had just got in the habit, as it was his fourth award. No doubt you're sincere if you think this is ""highly entertaining"" and filled with ""lovely scenery"" and ""captivating performances"" from Wayne and the admittedly striking and authentically Irish Maureen O'Hara, but please do forgive me if I don't join you."	1.0	Green Mashed Potatoes With Syrup	2011-03-01	19	2	17

We know that this movie was done prior to any of these wonderful new technologies, but as an important classic that this movie is, is worthwhile cleaning it up, making it worthy of the audience who adore this film.  After all, there is a full tourism  trade in the area that the movie was filmed  based on people's love of this film, and to honor the fantastic actors/actresses who made this film special.Even more deceptive is that fact the shells claims in two places (on the rear panel) that there is close captioning.  This is very important for many people who are hard of hearing, not to mention to allow accessibility, that has been made available to the public since 1986.  Let's do this right, folks, really.

Both providing outstanding acting in their roles. Superb.Having half of Ireland conspiring to further his romantic interests is a slight twist.John Ford's inherent ability to portray humanity is paramount.An exceptional cast, from the dozen or so lead characters to the seemingly countless bit players who added depth and a 3-D feeling to the story.And indeed, the real star -- rural Ireland in all its quaint glory.	5.0	Why Motion Pictures were invented, begorra!!!	2008-03-18	2	1	1

Wayne is the American boxer who returns to encounter a spunky Irish girl (Maureen O'Hara) and her cantankerous brother (Victor MacGlaglen).

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3FVF3T2HKQES7	"MICHAEL STODGHILL ""FILM COLLECTOR"""	"I've been waiting a long time for ""The Quiet Man"" to finally be released in an acceptable video picture having been so disappointed with the previous VHS and DVD versions. Those Republic titles from 1992 and 2002 contain terrible transfers of this classic John Ford film. I had high hopes when I read that Olive Films would be doing a new 4K scan of the film from the original film negative for it's 60th Anniversary Edition and after having watched it last night I was not disappointed. It's not a perfect blu ray release but it's centainly a lot better than the awful 2002 DVD ""Collector's Edition"" that I had. I say that because there are certain scenes in the film where the colors still appear murky and there is still a lot of visible film grain. But I think this has to do more with the state of the film elements(Technicolor) itself than the restorers at Olive. This is the only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five. It's certainly not on par with last year's ""To Catch A Thief""(Paramount) or ""Ben-Hur""(Warners) from the year before, but Olive deserves a lot of credit for giving we fans the best presentation of this delightful film in a long time. It was a personal project for John Ford and his ""stock company"" of actors and film colleagues and after he finished it he was seriously considering retiring from films. Thank god he didn't because we never would have gotten ""The Searchers"" had he did. Olive's new Blu Ray of ""The Quiet Man"" brings out all the themes of previous Ford films none more important than family. Anyone viewing his films ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""How Green is My Valley"" and ""The Searchers"" will certainly see how the family and how they deal with events that are sometimes out of their control really do hit a cord with people. There's a lot of that in ""The Quiet Man"" too. A lot of it has to do with the actors that were cast in individual roles and Ford was the master. You really believe that the Joads are a family in ""The Grapes of Wrath"" even though the actors came from different backgrounds and different parts of the country. The same can be said of ""The Quiet Man"". You really believe that both John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara are in love with one another and not going through the motions. The supporting cast is perfect too. Barry Fitzgerald, Victor Mclaglen, and Ward Bond gives great performances and are a delight. There's not much more to say. This blu ray release of Olive's ""The Quiet Man"" is a must for anyone who loves great filmmaking by one of the masters-John Ford. ""The Quiet Man""(Aspect ratio: 1.37.1)is 129 minutes and contains a printed booklet on the film and a ""Making of"" featurette(28 mins.) from the 1992 VHS edition hosted by Leonard Maltin. There are no subtitles. (Note: I also wrote a review of the 2002 DVD ""Collector's Edition"" in June, 2010 which I have since deleted. However, the date on this current review stills lists the old date of June 7, 2010. For the record, this blu ray review was written Jan. 30, 2013.

This is Duke Wayne in a classic leading man role - but worry not, John Ford doesn't forget his core audience.  Snappy dialogue (in the brogue), barenuckle fisticuffs and hard drinking abound.  Those familiar with the work of Ford and Wayne know well the enjoyment of sharing in the unmistakebly genuine affection that bind together this fine ensemble of actors, their director and the audience.

For the most part, the experience is like going to a movie theater, no lines, great sharpness.  Even old black and whites look wonderful on this system.I obtained the first transfer by Artisan and was shocked by the grotesque and constantly changing colors, and also the gross color fringing.  Most dark areas had a strong purple hew to them.  Color intensity was gross, greens bloomed out of the picture.  Sharpness was very poor.The added featurettes were little better.  My over all impression was that this was some sort of amateur video company run by incompetants with anciend junk equipment.  However, it appears that Artisan actually has money enough to get the rights to a great deal of John Wayne material.I then obtained the ""Collector's Edition.""

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	This movie really offers a little bit of everything, tied together in style into a magnificent cinematic package by one of the greatest directors who ever lived. It gives you one of the greatest screen couples ever, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara; it gives you unquestionably the greatest screen slugfest ever, between Wayne and Victor McLaglen; it gives you unforgettable performances by the premier members of the John Ford Stock Company, including Barry Fitzgerald, Ward Bond and Mildred Natwick; it gives you exquisite color photography of the Irish countryside, so that everyone who sees this movie will want to arise and go to Innisfree. Another thing it gives you, which most people don't credit it for, is the subtlety of the interrelationships between the characters. John Ford learned something from his countryman Oscar Wilde in presenting a comedy: the characters never learn a great many important secrets about each other, and never fully understand each other, but manage to reconcile anyway in the end. This gives the film a blessed grounding in reality that carries its moments of fantasy and whimsy. The Quiet Man is far more influential than most people assume; if you don't believe me, just rent a double bill of this movie and Bergman's &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night,&quot; which was made a few years after The Quiet Man.

When I saw it was now available to stream I was worried about quality: not all Amazon streams are created equal. iTunes had a sample trailer posted for their download, though, and it's quality was very good. iTunes is too limiting on where I can play a stream though, so I returned to Amazon and bought the HD stream here.I have never seen this movie look this good! Beautiful full colors, excellent sound! I'm realizing that I'd only ever seen washed out, edited copies on TV. I watched the HD stream through a roku box and a Panasonic blu ray player and it was gorgeous. Only the regular stream plays on an iPad or computer, and that version also looked vibrant.	5.0	STREAMING VERSION IN HD HAS EXCLLENT QUALITY	2014-03-21	1	1	0

The setting is a wonderful place that you long to visit yourself...the characters are instantly old friends and you feel good watching the movie over and over.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2XRZV63X79YSJ	"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector"""	I was never a fan of John Wayne, that is until I saw The Quiet Man.  This is one of the great films of the 1950's.  Instead of the wild west, this takes place in Ireland.Sean Thornton (Wayne) was a prize fighter who left the ring behind after killing an opponent to return to the family home in Inesfree, Ireland.  When he is walking the country side he sees a beautiful red head Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara).  He again sees her at church and approaches her.  Of course he makes one mistake by getting on the bad side of her eldest brother Red Will (Victor McLaglen).Will refuses to let Sean and Mary Kate court but the town intervenes.  Will finally agrees to let them court. This is the old fashioned courting with a chaperone.  But before you know it they were married.  At the wedding reception, Will proposes to the widow.  She refuses him and he causes a scene taking back the dowry.  Mary Kate will not leave without it, it's hers.  But Sean's pride is too big and he orders her to leave it.This causes problems between the newlyweds until Sean makes an issue of it.  This starts a fist fight between Sean and Will.  This scene is the greatest fight scene EVER filmed.  It has action, excitement and most important humor.  At the end, Sean wins and the Will gives Mary Kate her dowry.This is a film about the human spirit.  John Wayne gives his greatest performance ever.  Maureen O'Hara is luminous as always but more importantly, she is the perfect costar for Wayne.  There is a chemistry that only happened with one other actress, Lauren Bacall.  It's easy for someone to give a great performance but it shows true talent when you can draw a great performance from another actor, especially one that is not a great actor.At Oscar time both Wayne and O'Hara were totally overlooked but Ford was named Best Director.  This is a great film that is a must see film.DVD EXTRAS:The Making of The Quiet Man - A 28 minute featurette with commentary by Leonard Maltin and Andrew McLaglen, telling of the making of the film from newspaper story to getting a studio to the actual filming with stock interviews.The Joy of Ireland Documentary - A 30 minute featurette with interviews from Maureen O'Hara, assistant director Andrew McLaglen and son Patrick Wayne.  This covers a lot of the same material as the previous but is told from people involved with the making of the film plus it's nice seeing Maureen O'Hara again - she's still beautiful!Remembering The Quiet Man Montage - A 3 minute montage set to modern Celtic music.THIS IS FOR THE COLLECTIOR'S EDITION DVD NOT THE STANDARD VERSION.	5.0	Wayne - O'Hara - Ford a Magic Trio in a Magic Land	2006-01-20	4	4	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2WMRKPJTZRLAH	movin-on66	This was a great movie for John Wayne to show he could act outside of the cowboy genera. To me he offered another side of his acting ability that gave him more depth of character. Of course casting Maureen O'hara as Mary Kate Danaher, not only added a superb actress of great beauty but also a person who could play the part of this fiery and willful personality. One of John Wayne's long time acting buddies, Victor McLaglen was a perfect cast for the part of the bull headed and proud Squire Will Danaher.  Plus his large stature made it more plausible for the show down fight between Sean Thorton, John Wayne, and Squire Danaher.  Of course you can't overlook the many talents of Barry Fitzgerald as the man of various occupations including match maker in this movie.  He continued to excel as a character actor in his part as Michaleen Oge Flynn. Finally Ward bond as Father Peter Lonergan added to the color of the various characters in this John Ford production.  This is a very entertaining and worthy addition to your DVD collection if you enjoy the classics.	5.0	The Quiet Man	2012-07-24	0	0	0

A few of our friends are going to Ireland and had not seen The Quiet Man so I purchased the Collector's Edition for all of us to view together.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1HBR91JVUBMKW	Mr. J. M. Haines	The Quiet Man is in my opinion John Ford's greatest film, thus, one of the best films ever made. As well as the direction being perfect, this is also the case with the casting, the acting, the screen play, the music and the photography. It was the second time the world saw Ford's own personal and philosphical affinity with the very Un-British Gaelic community of the British Isles, but while Ford gritted his coal-blackened teeth to do the ( on balance ) more dour How Green was my Valley, here he revels in the pure delights of a near blarnified tale set in an idyll that was always going to wow the American and worldwide market, perhaps more so than the rest of the British Isles.So, the story itself, Mother and child leave Ireland to go the USA, mother fills son's head with nostalgic tales of the village of his birth, boy grows up, becomes a professional boxer, kills a man during a bout, leaves the ring behind to return to Ireland, falls for the red haired beauty with temper to match. Hereonin, old and modern clash and this sets up the bulk of the remainder of the film.The screen play for this film was gleaned from a series of short stories, The Green Rushes, by Maurice Walsh, which had a more at times darker back drop of the infamous and ugly battle between the original IRA and the much reviled Black and Tans. Thankfully, Ford only allowed the briefest of undertones of this in the film, and even then such references are more comic than sinister.There are many, many scenes and lines of dialogue which people recall again and again, here's my favourite. The local matchmaker / chaperon, played by Barry Fitzgerald, calls on Maureen O'Hara's character, he helps himself to an over generous glass of whiskey, and an alarmed Maureen O'Hara asks 'would you like water with that whiskey?' the reply? 'When I drink water I drink water, when I drink whiskey I drink whiskey'. And one more which is missed by many, really. The local widow ( or Minister's wife, can't remember now!) indulges in a gentle act of mockery / sarcasm when she says to John Waynes' character after refurbishing the cottage of his childhood, 'Who but an American would have thought of Emerald Green for a door.'My own affinity with this film comes from the days, not that long ago really, before cable TV, internet or even 24 hour telly. The Quiet Man strongly featured on Christmas film listings, especially on Christmas Eve. Watching this with the fire blaring, the front room lit only by the Christmas Tree lights which then reflected on the streamers, made Christmases even more special.There is only one downside, it is a tad long, I'm sure it could have been chopped by 20 minutes or so without loss of quality or impact, but, a very, very minor quibble.Finally as someone who has no time for Westerns, I wish Mr Ford had never heard of them, if he had not, he may have been able to knock out other films inspired by his own Gaelic roots?	5.0	If only if life was like this	2013-05-31	0	0	0

Since obtaining the DVD from Amazon.com I can't get Maureen O'Hara's brilliant appearance with John Wayne out of my head. Wayne plays the part of a returning Irish exile, nursing a secret boxing past in Chicago - where he accidentally killed an opponent in the ring - and on arrival in Ireland is captivated by the beautiful O'Hara driving sheep across one of the many splendid landscapes in the movie. To obtain Maureen's hand in marriage, John Wayne has to reluctantly take up the boxing again - this time without gloves - to win O'Hara's brother's consent to the marriage. Funny yes; comedy - not entirely, though when the catholic village turns out en masse to support the local protestant vicar in a tricky situation, it is hillarious; romance - yes, in a special Irish way. The appearance of Barry Fitzgerald as chaperone for the courting couple, is precious. This is the timeless Ireland I have taken my expatriate wife home to each year for the past several decades.	5.0	The Quiet Man	2009-05-20	1	1	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A258H69QKP20MI	Nicholas Stehle	"John Ford's ""The Quiet Man"" is one of John Wayne's best roles and best performances.  The Irish culture, countryside, and music truly made this film a masterpiece of the 20th century.  Maureen O'Hara played the hotheaded Irish native ""Mary Kate"" - a role for which she is well suited when one considers her other performances in such great films as ""McClintock!""Each and every main character is central to this film, and if a single were to be missing, the whole movie would have lost its quality, in my opinion.  The tough-minded, levelheaded thinking of Sean Thornton (John Wayne) combined with the rather emotional display of ""foolish"" honor on the part of his bride, Mary Kate, contrast nicely and do a wonderful job of illustrating some pretty clear differences in the across-the-pond cultures.This is a delightful film and I highly recommend it."	5.0	Five Stars	2003-09-04	3	3	0

I am not a 100% full on &#34;old movie buff,&#34; but for some reason no matter how many times I watch this flick I find myself smiling at the sweetness of it.  Too bad, that back in the day, they could not film the whole movie.  There is a missing piece at the beginning when Sean Thornton (John Wayne) is thrown an apple from someone on the train.  There was supposed to be a prologue with him and a teach talking, but they did not have the time.  Watching the special features you learn that they were told 100 minutes no more and no less, so they staged a filming for the movie company execs and stopped it at 100 minutes which left out the final 8 minutes of the movie.  I will not ruin such a grand movie for you, but the last 8 minutes are the best.This is the only movie I have seen where John Wayne is acting, he is not playing &#34;John Wayne&#34; and is in fact applying his craft as an actor.  The fact that you forget it is John Wayne through all of the movie makes this his best performance ever.  I am not a John Wayne fan, but this is my all time number 1 favorite movie and it became so when I first saw it at 22 years old about 10 years ago.  Visually it is colorful and stunning for its age and the script is spot on to get you into the sweet little irish community he moves to.A must see for movie buffs in my humble opinion.  I would have purchased it as a streaming movie if available when i purchased, but the DVD and packaging is great and I will always treasure owning this movie.	5.0	Just good old fashion sweetness	2014-03-06	0	0	0

It stars John Wayne, in a rare tender performance opposite one of his best co-stars - the lovely and luminous, Maureen O'Hara.Aside: I first saw this movie on late night television, some fifteen years ago.  It looked as though it were fed through a meat grinder.  I next had the opportunity to view, what was then billed as a restored version of, this movie during the early 1990's.  While there was a marked improvement in the quality of the print shown on the big screen it remained an evident fact that much more work was required to get this movie looking right.  So when Artisan Home Entertainment announced a completely remastered collector's edition, my heart lept.  I was, after all, expecting a print that would really knock my socks off.What I got was a DVD that looks more like my memory of the original television broadcast than the theatrical experience.  &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; looks awful.  There's no polite way to critique the excessively soft, blurry and dull image quality presented throughout.  Colors are poorly balanced with inconsistant flesh tones.  Black and contrast levels are so poorly realized that I can't deduce whether the staff at Artisan actually did some restoration work or are just trying to bluff the consumer into repurchasing this film on DVD.  Regardless, this is the worst looking DVD experience I've had in a long while.  The audio is mono, strident and wholly unsatisfying.  Edge enhancement, pixelization, aliasing and shimmering of fine details are obtrusive and an eye-sore to behold.Extras: I'll be honest.  After sitting through this dismal visual experience I was so disheartened I didn't even get to the extra features.  Artisan advertises a documentary and audio commentary as part of the deal.  Let's just leave it at that.  Although, they did also advertise this DVD as digitally remastered?!?!BOTTOM LINE: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!	1.0	ARTISAN SHOULD KEEP QUIET OVER ANNOUNCING SPECIAL EDITIONS	2003-04-28	18	14	4

The movie has a higher rating than I can imagine for being in the shape it is, which kept me wondering for a long time if I have a bad copy.  One reviewer stated that there were two similar copies and one was better than the other.  Alexis Ray gave this number DVD (ASIN: B00006JMRD) which is the one I am commenting on.  This is supposed to be the better of the two.  That led me to the conclusion that there isn't anything out there, at this time, that is worth watching very often.  The film is very much worth seeing, but it is sad that this is the best we can get.  If this movie was clear, I would give it 5 stars, or more if I could.  It is truly a classic, but one which was poorly photographed, or poorly kept, or poorly transferred.  Perhaps it received the awards it did because on the big screen people accepted less in clarity for a number of reasons.  Maybe TCM should show it somewhere on the big screen.  If anyone who gave this dvd a 4 or 5 star rating, and agrees that this movie is out of focus, perhaps they could comment on why the high rating.  Just curious.	2.0	Has Anyone Seen A Clear Print Of This Great Movie?	2011-10-26	1	1	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AC7MP9R2FKEAI	"Paul Miller ""___[_]D___"""	"John Ford's real name was Sean O'Feeney and this film set in Ireland is one of his best. Sean Thornton (John Wayne) returns to Ireland to live after living most of his life in the states. He sees Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara) from a distance and is instantly smitten.  Later they marry and trouble brews when her brother refuses to pay the dowry. Sean doesn't care, but to Mary Kate it is a point of honor. While in the states Sean was known as Trooper Thornton a boxer who accidently killed a man in the ring. He would rather not fight the brother over the dowry ,but you guessed it, he does and it is one of the greatest fist fights on film. This film has great comedy scenes like the priest trying to land his great fish, Sean walking  Mary Kate home from the train station, and the old man,(Ford's brother), on his death bed leaping up when he hears the fight.Maureen O'Hara had family in Ireland and John Wayne brought his with him, in fact there were family all over the set with a few making it into the film as extras. Most of the actors had worked together a year earlier making ""Rio Grande"" with Ford because the studio wouldn't make ""The Quiet Man"" without a western that would make money first. All the film Studio executives felt ""The Quiet Man"" would never make money.The film won two oscars including best director and needless to say was a box office success."	5.0	Quiet Man	2004-03-14	4	2	2

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A17BT73RVRQYSP	Peter Ingemi	That will be the result of seeing easily one of the top 5 movies John Wayne ever made.  The only gun is a starting pistol.  The horses are either drawing wagons or in the big race.The plot is simple John Wayne (Sean Thornton)returns from America where he was raised to settle back in his old home town in Ireland.  He runs afoul of Victor McLaughlin (Red Will Danaher) over a piece of land, but also falls for Danaher's sister Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara).This simple plot is overshadowed by an event in Wayne's past that shapes and scars him.  It isn't introduced at first but soon takes over the picture propelling it to its climax.The supporting cast, many of which we have seen many times before together (McLaughlin, Natwick, Shields, Bond et/all) all give top notch performances as usual.  The subplot involving McLaughlin &amp; Natwick shines bright and Barry Fitsgerald adds the right bit of blarney to the package.What makes this very pleasant move even more appealing is the 2nd level of supporting players and the community (who doesn't know Wayne's secret) that they play.  That community opinion and its consequences steers the picture, but only by fleshing out that community can it work.  We care about what these people think becasue we like these people.  From the Bartender, to the Engineer to Father Paul we meet the people of this village.I think the appeal of this picture is that community.  The idea of everybody knowing everybody else.  It contributed to its success at the time of its release when it was the reality here to some degree.  It contributes to its success now as we miss that same security.You also can't go very wrong when you pair O'Hara the ultimate strong woman with Wayne the ultimate strong man.  Only Hepburn &amp; Tracy can equal them here.Whatever the reason this picture is worth your time and your money.	5.0	The wearing of the grin.	2002-02-10	11	9	2

Ferrigno ""firehouse444"""	From all reports &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; was a very personal and passionate undertaking from director John Ford, and his company of players (most of Irish ancestry)....and what sweet fruit their passion bore...This is a film of such warmth, tenderness, humour and beauty that it just sparkles from beginning to end.Irish-born, American boxer Sean Thornton (John Wayne) returns to his place of birth after accidently killing another man in the ring. Seeking to find peace and happiness in the lush green country side, Sean is enraptured with the fiery Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara in a wonderful performance) but incurs the wrath of her bully of a brother Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) because of Thornton's purchase of local land.  Failing to abide by the customs of Irish courtship as advised by resident matchmaker Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) and Father Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond)...it's not long before the whole county is in a spin about this big Yank in their midst !!Amidst the lopsided courtship and Red Will's refusal to pay the dowry, Thornton &amp; Danaher square off in what must be the most entertaining and longest on screen fights in cinema history...much to the amusement of the entire town that turned out to watch !!&quot;The Quiet Man&quot; is such a wonderfully enchanting film, that it is as enjoyable for all ages today, as it was nearly 50 years ago. Truly, a film for those young at heart and those who can appreciate such a warm hearted and lovingly prepared ode to the magic of Ireland.	5.0	John Ford's gentle and loving salute to Ireland.......	2000-11-21	8	7	1
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AYXC0BI77LVIT	Philipgstekel	If you're reading this review or any other for that matter; you must have seen (and probably loved) this movie. There are over 400 reviews of this movie and I won't waste anyone's time rehashing the plot, performances of this terrific labor of love shown by John Ford and his ensemble of actors/characters.For whatever the reason, no one seems to want to clean up this movie and bring it up to 2012 standards for picture and sound.  TCM (Turner Classic Movies) shows this movie on occasion and with all of the time and effort they put into restoring movies and then selling on DVD, the movie shown on their channel, is the same LOUSY print that has been available for sale for many years.Reviews from 2004-2012 have called for some kind of revamping of this movie and nothing is being done!!!  My guess: whoever owns the rights to this movie is not putting forth the effort and trust to allow anyone to redo this movie and give it the treatment it deserves.If you're thinking about buying a DVD version of this movie thinking that it will be of better quality.......FORGET IT !!!Wait for it to show on Turner Classic Movies and save yourself some $$$.Once this movie get transferred on DVD with the kind of treatment it deserves, then by all means.......buy it!!!  But in the meantime......save your money.I'm sorry to say that apparently restoration of this movie has fallen on deaf ears (and blind eyes).Too bad.......and sad.	5.0	Loved the movie...hate the transfer	2012-06-26	1	1	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3POJJ7H47QUKY	Private	One of the greatest movies of all time (AFI and others agree), but ....The quality of ALL the existing DVD versions in the marketplace are far inferior to even the print used in repeated airings by Turner Classic Movies (TCM).Several years ago, the UCLA film restoration geniuses created a wonderful new print from the originals that has been seen in Los Angeles and Ireland.The ownership of the home video rights has passed through several corporate hands.  Right now, Lions Gate owns these rights.  Until such time as a Blu-Ray version comes out using the UCLA restoration, I would avoid buying this movie on DVD and simply watch the superior version shown by TCM.Updated 2013 -- the BluRay has finally been released.  Problems solved -- it is a HUGE improvement in picture quality.  Olive Films did a great job with the restoration.  Go with the Blu-Ray version (the dvd version is nearly unwatchable).	1.0	Wait for the UCLA restoration to be released	2008-07-15	11	9	2
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AF3HN9UFXMKB2	"""pspa"""	For those of us whose image of John Wayne is the man delivering one liners such as &quot;You see them Indians across the hill, they ain't dressed for Halloween,&quot; be prepared for a shock.  In this epic movie about an American boxer who kills a man in the ring and goes to Ireland to find himself, Wayne delivers one of the great performances ever seen, displaying an astonishing range of emotion and acting ability as, despite his vow to renounce violence, he is inevitably forced to fight for his bride, the ravishing Maureen O'Hara, whose brother opposes her marriage and refuses to give her her inheritance.  Magnificent acting by all involved.

Other than the one scene with his saggy man-boobs, you don't really get the impression that John has aged much. I have quoted Little Michaeline Og Flynn (please accept my apologies if I've misspelled) many times. It's a friendly movie with a great cast.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A5CU1N0KGG7HE	Randee Baty	Having just returned from a vacation in Ireland, we were anxious to watch The Quiet Man which my mother told me was one of my dad's favorite movies.  What a treat!  John Wayne is handsome and appealing, Maureen O'Hara is beautiful and tempestuous, the villagers are Irish to the core but it's the scenery that steals the show for me.  It's exactly what we saw in our week of driving around beautiful Ireland and brought back great memories.  Everything about this movie is fun.  Even the brawls are amusing to watch.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1SVXJZ3386U2D	Randy Keehn	When fans of John Ford debate his greatest film and when fans of John Wayne debate his greatest film, &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; is surely mentioned with prominance.  This movie is a terrific look at rural Ireland and its' archaic customs.  John Ford has never disguised his love of his ancestrial home and this movie is as good a testament to that love as any movie he has ever made.  It takes place in a small rural setting where a stranger (John Wayne) shows up one day.  The stanger reveals that he is Sean Thornton who has come home to his birth place.  He immediately falls for Mary Kate Danaher only to find that her brother, Will Danaher, is the town's tough man.  Sean also finds out that the ways of Ireland are not the ways of the USA where he was raised.  Sean has a secret that he keeps that he keeps to himself.  It is a secret that keeps him from fighting the assertive Will Danaher.  Through some conniving help from the local clergy, Sean is able to gain the hand of Mary Kate.  However, her expectations of Sean and his failure to deliver makes this a marriage in name only.  The only way to win her heart and solve his problems with his reputation is to fight his new brother-in-law.  What should he do?Each step of this story introduces us to characters, customs, music, and other aspects that bring out the Irish flavor.  We may not agree with the customs but we certainly have fun seeing how Sean Thornton is confounded by them.  Fans of Wayne will have a special appreciation of his outstanding preformance.  He is subdued but not beaten, confused but not lost.  He is excellently matched with Maureen O'Hara who brings a brilliant performance as Mary Kate Danaher.  She makes for a strong woman in a movie that demonstrates women's weak status in the culture.  Andrew McLaglen is also excellent as the imposing Will Danaher who takes a step back for no one.  One of the great qualities of a John Ford film is the stock acters that fill the many supporting roles.  In this movie we are treated to a number of great supporting preformances highlighted by the acting of Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields, and Mildred Natwick.The cinematography is terrific, the scenery inviting, and the music is superb.  Lucky is the person who has the soundtrack of this movie.  The music is enchanting from the beginning to the end.Over the years I have met my share of John Wayne detractors.  As yet I have not met one who won't secretly acknowledge that they loved this film.  This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family and it is one that can be watched over and over.	5.0	Outstanding!	2002-12-15	1	1	0

Crocker	"I understand there are so many old films literally falling apart because the film they are on is made of nitrocellulose which is only stable for a certain period ..... if I was rich, I would be involved with something like that. You would think that with a classic movie like this, someone would have done a digital touchup/remake but apparently not. The product reviews on Amazon of the anniversary edition and the blu-ray edition and in fact, all the editions from that one company, suggested that they were terrible and a sham. I will just have to keep my fingers crossed that someone will salvage it soon. I am a John Wayne fan. If you will read a little about the man, you will see that his father was a pharmacist ...... they had to move to California from a midwestern town due to the father having a lung condition. Wayne came from modest means. Playing football for USC, luck turned his way when Tom Mix got him a summer job as a prop man in exchange for some football tickets. He met John Ford (whose real name was Irish) and they hit it off. The rest is history. Many didn't like Wayne's conservative political stance, but my readings show him to be a generous man who told thetruth as he saw it. He didn't take himself too seriously. When asked to run for President of the US, he declined, sayin he didn't think the American people would take an actor too seriously. As for the characters he played, every actor has to have an identifiable and likable personality ...... a schtick as it were. Wayne's was forward and pushy but his roles called for ""hero types"" ........ not trembling cowards. I fought a 40 year addiction to cigarettes ...... when I came along, everybody smoked including my doctor. I'm glad the young people today know the perils of smoking and the officials of our country should never give up on emphasizing the negative effects of all drugs. Apparently,Wayne could not control the cigarettes and they are probably the cause of his death. Maureen O'Hara ........ I love women and I fell in love with her the first time I saw her ........ and I love redheads. I saw where she revisited Ireland a few years ago at the age of 90, I believe. She seemed afraid. I am in my 60's now and getting old sucks. Watching good people, ....... pretty people ...... people with manners and character, get old is like watching your parents or yourself getting old. Sad. The quality of this dvd is not up to a good VHS but its apparently all that is available. Chances are, it was copied from a VHS so if you can find it on a good condition VHS tape, you might be better off. Not much definition ........ you have to crank the volume up ....... and in a couple of places for a very short time, the characters move too fast like an old black and white Charley Chaplain film. Still, what are you going to do ? I love this movie so much, I would buy/watch it in almost any condition. This is a feel good movie ..... you feel better after you've watched it than you did before.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2TY359PR45ATP	"R. Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2"""	John Wayne as a romantic lead...and he handles it so well! The chemistry between Wayne and Maureen O'Hara as the female lead is palpable and their romance lights up the screen. O'Hara and Wayne appeared together in several films; this was their best collaboration...my opinion of course. The support cast, especially Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald and Victor McLaglen - McLaglen in particular - are superb. John Ford's direction is outstanding...this is one of his best films, especially outside the Western genre. If you've never seen John Wayne outside his usual western, military, he-man vehicle, you need to see this one. It will convince you I think, that Wayne's acting ability was so much more than one-dimensional, and so much more than he was ever given credit for...and Ford had a knack of bringing out the best in the Duke. This movie features one of Wayne's best performances...one of the best from the fiery Irish redhead too.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"The lush and beautiful countryside of Ireland provides the setting for this engaging tale of an Irishman, raised in America, going back home to escape a past he'd just as soon forget.  In ""The Quiet Man,"" director John Ford returns to his own roots, going on location to tell the story of Sean Thornton (John Wayne), a man troubled by an incident that changed his life, and now doing what he can to forget about it and just move on.  And toward that end, Sean travels to the place he knows so well from the stories told him by his mother, to Innisfree, intending to buy the cottage in which he was born, White O'Morn, where he can make a fresh start and build a new life for himself.  There's a problem, however; the land and the cottage is owned by the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick), and borders the estate of one Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), who not only fancies the widow herself, but wants to buy her land.  Squire Danaher (as he's known) is not the only one Sean must deal with, though, as other matters arise upon his arrival in the small hamlet of his birth.  And her name is Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara)-- who just happens to be Squire Danaher's sister.  But Danaher or no, it makes no difference to Sean, who as soon as he lays eyes on Mary Kate determines to make her his wife.Sean soon learns that in Ireland, however, such things are pursued quite differently than in America.  To win the hand of Mary Kate he must employ the services of Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) a kind of matchmaker/chaperone/marriage broker, who will help him secure the consent of Squire Danaher, without which the marriage cannot and will not take place.  So Sean has no choice but to acquiesce to the local traditions and customs, and Michaleen forthwith commences the appropriate overtures.  In the meantime, he awaits the decision of the widow Tillane as to the purchase of White O'Morn, which he is determined to have at any cost.John Ford directed more than 140 motion pictures, going back to the days of silent films, and his favorite star, with whom he worked in at least a dozen of his feature films, was John Wayne.  And when you think of the John Ford/John Wayne collaborations, it's the Western that instantly comes to mind:  ""Stagecoach,"" ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,"" ""Fort Apache,"" ""Rio Grande"" or ""The Searchers,"" (to name a few).  Yet, ""The Quiet Man"" is perhaps their most memorable effort, and remains a favorite among fans to this day.  Ford (who received an Oscar for Best Director for it) presents the story on a very personal level, and in Sean and Mary Kate gives the audience characters to whom they can relate; and it's that personal connection he affords the viewer that may suggest the main reason behind this particular film's popularity.  That, plus the fact that at the core of this story there is an honesty and genuine sincerity that rings so true-to-life.  Ford also successfully captures the essence of all that is good and positive about Ireland, from the richness of all of his characters to the lavish cinematography that brings the country so vividly to life.  It's quite simply a wonderful, uplifting film, impeccably crafted and delivered by Ford and his superb cast.Too often, John Wayne's work gets a bad rap; no matter what role he takes on, you're liable to hear ""John Wayne is always John Wayne, the only difference is the character's name.""  And, as he proves with his portrayal of Sean Thornton, it's not only a false statement, it's so unfair to an actor who brought so much to so many, in his craft as well as in his personal life.  The Oscar he finally received for 1969's ""True Grit"" was way overdue, especially when you consider his performances in such films as ""The Searchers,"" ""Red River"" and, of course, this one.  Is he the best actor of all time?  Of course not; but he is good at what he does, much better than he is usually given credit for.  And he (and his films) can always-- always-- be counted on to provide good, solid entertainment.  Together, he and Ford have provided some of the most memorable moments in the history of the movies, and his pairing with Maureen O'Hara was a stroke of genius.  There's real chemistry between them, which enables them to play so well off of one another.  They made five films together between 1950 (""Rio Grande"") and 1971 (""Big Jake""), and there is always that spark of magic between them, but never better than in this film.A gifted actor, Maureen O'Hara is also, without question, one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen.  It's easy to understand how Sean Thornton can fall instantly in love with her when he first sees her walking through the fields of Innisfree.  It's entirely believable.  And when you get to know the woman behind the beauty-- who Mary Kate is down deep-- it's even more understandable.  Perfectly cast, O'Hara, like Ford, returned to her roots to make this film (she was born in Milltown, Ireland, near Dublin), and apparently it agreed with her, because her performance is nothing less than natural and inspired.  Mary Kate Danaher, in fact, is arguably one of her-- if not ""the""--  most memorable roles of her career.The supporting cast, topped by Fitzgerald (who is absolutely unforgettable as Michaleen) also includes Ward Bond (Father Lonergan), Francis Ford (Dan Tobin), Arthur Shields (Reverend Playfair) and Jack MacGowran (Feeney).  A delightful and endearing motion picture, ""The Quiet Man"" is, of all of John Ford's achievements, one of his best.  And Sean, Mary Kate, Michaleen and all the people of Innisfree are ones you'll remember and want to visit again.  It's the magic of the movies."	5.0	One of John Ford's Best	2002-01-28	9	8	1

This film pops up on TV every St. Patrick's Day, but with worn out versions with dust and scratches, mediocre picture quality, and muffled sound.  Now, Olive Films has done a great job of a 4K scan of the original negative of the film. Pluses: the images are so sharp you can almost reach out and touch the Irish tweed coats and hats, there is no dust and scratches anywhere, and there is a very clear DTS-Master mono audio track that is surprisingly good for a 50's Movie Minuses: This is 1951 Technicolor technology. The color is muted and slightly warm, with lowered contrast. Olive could have touched this up in their scanning, but probably and rightly so, wanted the film to be seen as originally presented. Also, the only extra is &#34;The Making of The Quiet Man with Leonard Maltin&#34; has surprisingly bad picture quality compared with the film itself, but this could be the source material. Only interesting to watch for the background on the movie. That's the only extra.As for the film itself, if you're reading this review, you know its a John Ford classic! This is not the new Hollywood fodder with CGI and foul language covering up hackneyed plots and cookie cutter characters. This is a Full House: John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Victor McLaglen, Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald, plus a cast of colorful supporting actors. These are people and characters you care about each time you watch it.In summary; If this is your genre of film and you have a Blu ray player - Buy it!

John Ford was right in jumping through all the hoops the studio made him go through just to get this film made. It was worth it.  The story isn't the key to loving this film. The wonderful cast and their acting bring this film to life. One wants to visit Kon Ireland just to see the cottage that was the center piece of this story. ( The cottage still exists!)This particular issue is great since the creation process of making it a Blu-ray cleared up a minor problem here and there. There are three films everybody should view at least once, &#34; How green was my valley&#34;, &#34;The Grapes of wrath&#34; and &#34;The Quite Man&#34;.	5.0	Viewing this great film has become a family tradition.	2014-04-05	2	1	1
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A211RPEXXTY1RT	Richard R. Pace	There is probably little more that can be said about this gentle, charming film about an Irish-American's return to his roots in middle-age. The late John Wayne and the marvelously authentic Maureen O'Hara (she was born in Ireland) are practically the definition of on-screen chemistry; the story they and the excellent supporting cast present is both enduring and refreshing.The major problem with prior DVD editions of this film was the poor print quality. Even the so-called remastered release had a blurry, grainy quality to it that looked more like an old VCR tape than a DVD. Happily, this Blu-ray version solves that problem, at least to the extent that it is possible to do so in connection with a 60-year-old film. For the most part, the colors are vibrant, the scenes are in reasonably sharp focus, and the remastered soundtrack with its almost primal sounding Gaelic music is excellent. If you liked the film in its original iteration, you will likely love this version.	5.0	Finally, An excellent Blu-ray transfer of a classic movie	2013-03-02	4	3	1

They did a fantastic job of restoring this film.  It is a 5 star rating.  However, I gave this a 1 star rating because the only special feature on it is a documentary hosted by a very young looking Leonard Maltin from a much older DVD (2002?) and it looks awful by comparison.  Miss O'Hara's commentary  is missing as well as two or three other features from a previous DVD version which is a crime by my standards.  This film is a classic by many people in the industry as well as the public and for some reason they did not include these other features.  This is not a rare thing as other DVD's I have are changed when the Blu Ray version comes out so I have to keep the DVD if I ever want to see those again.  Many people don't ever watch the extras on DVD's etc. but I do and its a shame since there is so much to talk about.	1.0	Blu Ray Only!	2014-05-17	3	0	3

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AGZVS6M8XJGN6	"Roberto Frangie ""Robert"""	"""The Quiet Man"" is an Irish village version of ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" the tamer being an ex-pugilist Sean Thornton (John Wayne) retired to the land of his fathers where he purchases ""that little place across the brook, that humble cottage."" But no sooner does he arrives on a soft spring morning than he falls in love with Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara).Sean courts and weds her easily enough, but he has not worked out on the anger of her heavy and hard rich brother, the farmer Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) who holds an envy against him for having bought the very property that separates his spread from that of the wealthiest widow in Innisfree Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick) whom Danaher strongly desires...Danaher refuses to supply the traditional dowry, and Mary Kate accuses Sean for his apparent cowardice in not fighting for what is rightfully theirs...The battle that follows (considered to be the longest recorded on screen) has Sean and his strong brother-in-law engaging in a climatic fight the townsfolk have long been anticipating with effervescent...Maureen O'Hara is totally in her element as the fiery Irish girl whether as the bare-footed attractive woman looking after a number of sheep in the meadow, or as the troubled colleen trying to explain her problem to the devoted salmon-catching Catholic priest (War Bond) or as the proud beauty whom Wayne lets fall at her brother's feet... Maureen would play Wayne's love interest in four more features (""Rio Grande,"" ""The Wings of Eagle,"" ""McLintock,"" and ""Big Jake""). Their screen relationship emphasized the strength of their chemistry...Barry Fitzerald is simply superb as Michaeleen Flynn, the village matchmaker and cart-driver who can't seem to tell anyone something without winning a black beer from them first...With an exciting Innisfree Races along the beach, a titanic fight from the farm, across the hillside, through a haystack and into a stream, and with emerald environments and great music, John Ford's romantic comedy is a marvelous entertaining film, painted beautifully, simply told with love and humor...With 7 Academy Award Nominations, the film earns Ford his 4th and last Oscar for Best Director establishing a record which is still unbeaten and won another Oscar for the outstanding Technicolor for Best Cinematography..."	5.0	Archetypal John Ford comedy, as Irish as can be...	2007-01-11	0	0	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AXP8ULN4FULTS	"Robyn B. Mcgorm ""tiddles"""	The story is great and the actors are dynamite in their roles that there is so much going on you can't leave your seat. A classic that will have you immersed with the movie that nothing will get done. The story goes that a retired fighter returns home to his up bringing in Ireland to claim what is rightfully his. Secrets are held back and he falls in love with a village girl to which he must be approved by her brother and a diary paid for her. Nothing quite goes right and the story is fast and with that touch of comedy that will have you loving this show right from the start. Action plus suspense with a bit of this and that added makes this an A grade plus for sheer delight and fabulous entertainment that will have you pleading for more, there was room for more but never carried on what a pity. There is plenty of people and they all get involved even to handing a stick to beat her with and with fist flying what more could you ask for, so now go to the store get the movie wonder over to the shop pick up the popcorn now it's not a night in without the popcorn, grab your chair put your feet up and relax as its all worth it.

You will laugh at the line.CONSIreland's picturesque countryside and the  love of Ireland and its people cannot be enjoyed one bit due to the utter GREED and Shotty transfer to DVD  BY REPUBLIC PICTURES .You can actually see in the first 15 minutes the colors fading in and out and the very bad contrast change on the faces of the actors which are at times hard to make out.Too bad  REPUBLIC PICTURES  butchered the heck out of this  fine Classic.REPUBLIC PICTURES stated that they  re-mastered this timeless classic that won 2 ACADAMY AWARDS .  THEY LIED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They should be held accountable and be forced to  recall all of the videos and be forced at their own expense  to Truly Re-Master the Quit Man all at their expense and ship them to all the people who purchased this fine classic.I am not one for Government intrusion..... However  I believe Congress should act on contemptuous acts of blatant thievery and  lying to the public just to make a few Hundred million off people like you and me 'I with many , have commented on this utterly deplorable transfer of this classic film to DVD.It states quite clearly on the review  that this film has been digitally Re-Mastered .

To celebrate St. Patrick's Day we decided to stay home and watch it yet again. It has everything from laughs and romance to a really enjoyable village fight at the end.The Irish setting for the film is like something out of a fairy tale. The locals that are in the film really do an excellent job of making you believe you are in Ireland; or at least a romanticized version of Ireland.	5.0	St Patrick's Day Movie Night	2014-03-18	0	0	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A126KX6FVI4T66	"Roger Bagula ""Roger L. Bagula"""	Many Irish left home and went to America as a result of the potatoblight which caused a famine. The family in question was aone that had left after the father died and now, the son was returning.The land was owned by a rich protestant woman ( read British here?)and was being sought by the brother of the red haired womanwho has stricken the hero on his first look.The girl's wealth was part of the wedding deal that was finally struck,but the brother finding that he has been tricked goes back on the dealat a price of 350 pounds.In the end there is a fist fight that the whole county comes to bet on.That the hero was an American prize fighter comes out slowly.I liked this movie this third or fourth viewingand god more out of it than ever before.Irish customs are very old world when it comes to courting,but love seems to have short circuited that here.John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara  went on to make a lot of films togetherafter this.	4.0	The culture of Ireland  brought home	2009-05-07	0	0	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A13MTQOJDRYXZJ	Roger Howerton	"I love to see pictures of the lush greenery of the Emerald Isle, so I anticipated one of the most spectacular films of one of the most beautiful countries in the world when I bought this ""Collector's Edition"" of which the packaging read ""digitally remastered."" I couldn't wait to see how beautiful the greens of Ireland would look with the red of Maureen O'Hara's hair. I put the DVD in the player and settled back and began watching. I was appalled. The skin tones were orange and the picture was so distorted that I thought something was wrong with my television settings. I put in another DVD to compare, and it was perfect. So, before returning the DVD to the store (like THAT would have done me a lot of good!), I came here to read the comments about ""The Quiet Man"" on Amazon, and, sure enough, I'm not the only one who is disappointed. Sure, I like a good story, but the reason why I purchased a DVD player and a surround sound system and big screen television is so I could get great QUALITY! For Artisan to produce such a low-quality reproduction of a classic movie is horrendous. I would not recommend this ""Collector's Edition"" to any collector, unless they are just desperate to see the movie. This DVD rendition is no better than VHS quality. The 1-star rating is not for the movie itself -- it's a great movie (and I also enjoyed the behind-the-scenes information in the bonus material); the low rating is aimed at the producers of this sorry reproduction.And in response to the ""Kid's Review,"" yes, when I was younger, this movie was boring to me also, but watch it again when you are older and I think you will appreciate it more. Maybe by then, there will be a higher quality edition available."	1.0	What's Wrong with This Picture?	2005-03-21	29	27	2
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2BIAR1V0PWO27	"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S..."	This is not your typical John Wayne Film, which is what makes it worthwhile and amusing. Like many this is a movie I have seen since I was a kid.  I use to think it was great then, and I still think its amusing today, and beautifully photographed.Having since grown up and traveled to Ireland (once, don't know if I will again in this lifetime!) I would have to say this is not a flattering portrait of the auld sod!  Women are portrayed as tempermental, explosive creatures, and men are expected to thrash them around to calm things down in the household.  Not a great image for Ireland today or anytime!  A lot of the characters are standard Irish stock portraits.  In other words hopeless stererotypes that are no longer the norm today.The final fight scene is a typical Hollywood joke.  John Ford for all his supposed accuracy in cinema allows two giants to pommel each other for hours w/o a drop of blood shown on screen!  Now of course if the real thing were shown I suppose it would take the fun of it away.  I guess you notice these things after you have grown up and seen a film again after a few years.  This is a fun flick for Saint Patrick's Day where nobody takes anything serious about Ireland!  Unfortunately many Americans of Irish background have these out-dated notions about what Ireland is about today.  These romantic and silly ideas were gleaned from looking at films like this when they were kids!There is a nice follow-up on how the film was made and produced on the VHS version I saw which makes this kind of extra as good as what you would find on most DVDs.	3.0	Lots of Blarney and Wayne	2006-03-15	11	2	9

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3RA1OC150X0U2	Ronald Boyd	I will not, as some feel necessary, go over the story/characters/performances of this film. Suffice to say, this is one the most enjoyable films ever made, blarney or not.Rather, what I would like to briefly comment on is the utterly pathetic transfer of this classic film to DVD. It states quite clearly on the back of the cover that this film has been digitally remastered. I took that to mean both video and audio. WRONG. The picture quality of this DVD is shocking, one of the worst I have ever seen. Believe me when I say this -- the VHS version I purchased in 1991 has a better video clarity than this. At times it's actually difficult to make out the actors features. The company behind this, ARTISAN I believe they are called, should be ashamed. I have a copy of the recently released and remastered CASABLANCA DVD. That film was made in 1942, yet it looks as if it was just made, such is the sharpness of the video. The Quiet Man deserved the same treatment, but didn't get it. Shame on ARTISAN.	1.0	Crushing disappointment	2004-10-13	415	388	27

Well, I had to get it because of the reasons mentioned above.A good old fashioned big Hollywood movie that has a great story line.  It is a very good movie, a little squirky in spots, but overall a great movie with a great plot.  Loved the scenery, and loved the acting.  It shows how men and women used to &#34;court&#34; each other many years ago.  There is also an extra feature about John Ford and making the movie.  I enjoyed watching that segment too.  Two great stars with John Wayne and Irish born Marleen O'Hare.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1B9CWY15M5SO5	Spur	I have had three versions of this movie, one of my John Wayne favorites. The first was a VHS version, the second the DVD, John Wayne Collection ISBN 0-7820-1057-1 version and now this Olive Films Blu-ray one. The reason I purchased this last copy is that the DVD copy has a very poor resolution even though the colors are vibrant. The new Olive Films version while having a much improved resolution has issues with colors. I believe there is an over saturation of the reds and blues but an under saturation of the greens resulting in a washout look. Overall, I will continue to use this Blu-ray copy until a better copy which gets the colors right is offered	4.0	Good but not great	2014-03-31	2	2	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3UNGGV9D2UVQY	Stephane Lauzon	I already wrote a review of this movie but by reading the other reviews I'm wondering what happened after Artisan re-release this title. First of all, I bought my copy the week it was release for the first time, in 1998 I think. The look of the front art is a little different from the one they are selling now, there is no black contour and the background color behind the image of John Wayne and Maureen embrassing is a soft grey. I'm writing this because my copy is not that bad, it's blurry in some places but like I said in my review, some exterior scenes are clear and gorgeous. The audio is not great but everything is in sink with the action. I don't know if it's because I bought it when it was released or because I bought it in Canada (I don't believe so cause I think our stock comes from the states) but anyway if you can try to find an early edition DVD copy, maybe you won't find it that bad.	4.0	Look for an early edition	2002-06-10	4	1	3

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3M0YP958H2KRX	Steven K. Szmutko	THE QUIET MAN is one of (in my opinion)John Wayne's best film.  Directed by John Ford, it features a stellar cast including Maureen O'Hara, Barry Fitzgerald, Victor McLaglen, Mildred Natwick, and Ward Bond, in addition to other fine, but less known actors.This release is the first one that seems to have a proper restoration about it.  The quality of this DVD is vastly superior to anything previously out there.  For years, it seemed that the only version was a washed-out release, like a photograph that had been in the sun too long.  The version showed on television in recent years (including the one shown on AMC) has been one so cut and mangled (to fit in the time allotted), that numerous small, but important scenes were deleted -- an abominable practice to be sure.This edition is completely uncut and looks great.  The extras are well done and enjoyable.  I would recommend this highly to anyone who wants to see the film as John Ford intended it to be seen.	5.0	Sure'n.....tis a fine ol' Film!	2005-12-06	8	5	3
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	"John Ford's ""The Quiet Man"" is a John Wayne film of a different feather.  There are no stampedes, cowboy hats, stagecoaches, six-shooters, or marauding Indians in this film.  Nope, instead what we get are idyllic scenery, good-natured match-making, bare-knuckle fistfights, and whimsical townsfolk.  This is a film that downplays Wayne's masculine persona by infusing it with a touch of sensitivity and grace.  It is also director Ford's love letter to Ireland and the care he approached this film with is apparent in every frame.  ""The Quiet Man"" follows Sean Thornton (Wayne) as he returns to his ancestral homeland to heal after accidentally killing a man during a boxing match.  He is reunited one by one with people who knew his father and grandfather and is eagerly embraced by the community.  Thornton's eye quickly becomes fixated on  redhead Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) and thoughts of marriage enter his mind.  However, there's a hurdle in her brother, Squire ""Red"" Will (Victor McLaglen) who is unwilling to give the couple his blessing.  What follows is a serious of charming set-pieces as Thornton and the townspeople do everything they can to help manipulate matters in Thornton's favor.  Eventually everything works out but not before the inevitable physical showdown between Thornton and Will which settles everything once and for all.  The glorious Technicolor in which the film is shot captures the lush beauty of the Irish countryside to the point where it seems it might overshadow the characters.  Yet, Wayne and O'Hara bring such strong characters to life that they manage to elevate themselves above their surroundings.  Everyone knows Wayne is money in the bank in the acting department but O'Hara's performance is equally dazzling.  Her Mary Kate is every bit the equal of Wayne's Thornton in passion, strength, and hard-headedness that it's a joy to watch Wayne spar against her throughout the film.  Like I mentioned before, ""The Quiet Man"" has a lot in it that you'd probably never expected to see in a John Wayne film, but that shouldn't discourage you in seeking it out.  In fact, you should see it just to marvel at how well John Wayne performs in a non-tough-as-nails role."	3.0	"""Two women in the house -- and one of them a redhead!"""	2003-02-14	0	0	0

I don't care for a lot of the war movies or westerns that he made, but I do love the movies that are funny that he did. I love this movie with Maureen O'Hara. She to me makes this film great. I don't feel that any other woman could of done this character as well as she did. I feel that she accents John Wayne in a couple of his movies. This movie is about John Wayne being a ex boxer. He stopped boxing, because he killed another boxer in the ring. He decide to go to Ireland where he was born and was going to stay for the rest of his life. He see this young woman Maureen O'Hara and he falls in love with her. Its a very rocky relationship from the start. She isn't the easiest person to be around. He does marry her, but even their marriage is rocky. Her brother is always trying to fight him, but John doesn't fight, because he always thinks of the other boxer that died. In the end he does fight him and all the towns people follow them and take bets as to who was going to win.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A16F3IAR2659FN	surfbass	I am watching this DVD on St. Patrick's day, enjoying the story and lamenting the terrible visual quality of the transfer.  This is the collector' edition DVD and it totally lets down the video quality of the original.  It is VERY badly pixellated and the dark areas of the image have little or no detail.  Although the movie remains a wonderful classic even when viewed at such poor quality, the images in the film are a letdown.  I should also note that the film is reproduced in 4:3 ratio, which I suspect is unnecessary.Frankly, this movie would look better viewed on a standard resolution CRT (tube) TV than on any HD set, as the lower resolution of the older tube would allow the nasty pixellation of this version to blur a little.  I suspect that a good VHS copy viewed through an S-video connection would look as good.	2.0	A classic movie badly transferred to DVD	2014-03-17	1	1	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AJA0B2P7LUFBQ	"Susan Z. Swan ""com prof"""	"In writing this review, I'll assume that one is already a fan of this little charmer of a film and address my comments to the re-mastered DVD. This 60th anniversary special edition DVD is really quite beautiful (even if it isn't a Blu-Ray). The clarity of the image surpasses any previous version. The colors are vivid and rich; the intensity of the reds and greens are just what one would expect (and hope for) from 1950s Technicolor. I realized for the first time exactly why Hotaling, McCarthy, and Thompson were nominated for an Oscar for Best Color Art Direction/Set Direction. The fine details of the sets, especially the interiors, add a new dimension to ""reading"" scenes as one can actually see the furnishings, knick-knacks, and props as well as the photos on the mantelpieces, the paintings on the walls, even the details on the china. The costumes show a depth of textures, patterns, and colors that add quite a bit to the period feel and authenticity of the film. It's possible now to see just how superb the lighting and cinematography truly is. (I just popped in the Collector's Edition for comparison and saw it revealed for the almost unwatchable mess of blurry visuals and mushy sound that it is.) The high quality of the 60th anniversary version does create a few odd disappointments. The process shots using footage filmed in the studio are now seen as poorly done in comparison to the on-location work. And, one can now see a few shots that should never have made the final cut (John Wayne's duck waddle out of the church is a notable example).So why only a 4 of 5 stars? Why invest so much money creating such a beautiful transfer and not bother with such basics as subtitles or closed captions? The special features are definitely lacking as well. ""The Making of the Quiet Man"" feature is recycled from the Collector's Edition. The printed booklet is interesting, although if one already owns McBride's ""Searching for John Ford,"" there's nothing new there either. No commentary tracks are included, which isn't exactly a deal breaker, but one generally expects so much more from a major anniversary edition.This is definitely a DVD worth owning. I'm glad I bought it: Watching the film is such a delight with this beautiful HD transfer. But Olive Films should be embarrassed to release a film without even subtitles/closed captioning. And a list price of $30 is preposterous with such a lack of special features."	4.0	60th anniv. DVD: absolutely beautiful but lacking special features	2013-01-29	4	3	1

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A14KVEDYHNCFJP	T. Davis	"This review is for the Blu Ray version of this film. I watched it on a 92"" screen to make sure it could hold up to being projected up to a ridiculously huge level.Now, 24-hours after watching this stunning Blu Ray, I am still struggling to find words to describe the masterful job Olive did with this transfer. I know this movie very well...probably at the 'geek' level...so I was prepared to scrutinize almost every frame.Oh my.All the other 5-star reviews of this version are spot on with examples about the clarity of this movie (the 1-star review entitled, 'Disappointed', I can't explain, so won't bother trying). I saw what the other 5'ers saw, but whether it was watching it at 92"", the clarity of Blu Ray, or both, what I got the biggest thrill from was the very nuanced, almost undetectable smile (almost Mona Lisa-like) Maureen O'Hara gave John Wayne when she first saw him across the meadow. I needed a cold shower right there and then. I'd have paid $100 for this disc just for that. Wow.Here's another example of it's clarity: in the Blu Ray version of 'It's a Wonderful Life', at 92"" you can clearly read the print on the distant bank deposit slips displayed behind Thomas Mitchell just before he loses the $8,000 to Lionel Barrymore. The Blu Ray of 'The Quiet Man' matches that clarity."	5.0	I'm Speechless!	2013-01-24	15	15	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A1MT7PXVUTLW7Q	The Beagles	Director, John Ford, is mostly known for his great westerns, but his reverence of Irish culture clearly shows through in &#34;The Quiet Man&#34;.  Shot on location in 1952, this film is a snapshot of an Ireland that no longer exists - where Gaelic was spoken and nary a car could be seen - only horse-drawn carriages.  Ford's masterpiece gave John Wayne perhaps his most iconic role, placing him in a bygone Ireland where most of the homes still had thatched roofs and a girl had to have the permission of the man of the house to be courted.  If you're lucky enough to be of Irish descent, you must not miss this film.  If you're not Irish, it's still a cinematographic gem that never fails to bring a smile.	5.0	A Timeless Classic	2014-03-29	0	0	0

It's one I keep coming back to it again and again, and is one of those movies that I was hoping/waiting for to appear  on DVD. That said, I give the DVD only 3 stars because the video quality in  many places is not much above a good VHS tape. The problems include soft  picture, over/undersaturation of colors, and--worst of all in this  format--sound very obviously out of synch.

Of course, you wouldn't know that, from the horrifying job done on the previous DVD transfer. If ever a movie needed and deserved a make-over, its THE QUIET MAN. Someone please get to work restoring this. We fans would love to see something along the lines of a BEN HUR restoration. I've read online that a 2K copy exists (somewhere). Films like this are national treasures, and should be treated as such. Maybe, the persons owning the video rights are being jerkish. No idea why we haven't seen this 5 star film with a decent treatment. As others have stated, the DVD for THE QUIET MAN, looks like a straight copy from a VHS tape. The only time I can even stand to watch this is when its Turner Classic Movies. (Ted, send me a copy)...Seriously, don't bother with either of the DVDs floating around out there.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2ARR4TZXZ570U	Thomas Kepler	"Having been away from home and my wife for three weeks, I was looking forward to watching John Ford's The Quiet Man.John Wayne gets to show his more sensitive self, Ireland shows its green--welcome after the early Mediterranean browns of California's spring rather than the green spring of Iowa. Maureen O'Hara gets to show her feisty self to best advantage . . .And I was moved by Wayne's interpretation of fighter Sean Thornton who has vowed to keep his fists out of the fight. And I did enjoy the green fields heavy with recent rain. (The Quiet Man was the first American major film to have footage shot in Ireland.) Maureen O'Hara was the ""fiery Mary Kate,"" damned if any man was going to tell her what to do and damned if she would love any man who wouldn't and couldn't.It was the stereotypes that got to me: men violent to women and brawling as a pastime; drunkenness as a national pastime; smoking as the essence of virility. After a while, I had to enjoy the film in spite of its assumptions.This film was released in the year of my birth. Thank god my growth and my generation's was away from many of the social beliefs of that time. We are a diverse world, and I'm glad to have that understanding as part of who I am. The Irish aren't all drunken brawlers any more than all Americans are violent, gun-packing mobsters.The movie, though, has its sweet and humorous moments--it's just too bad that when Sean Thornton, aka John Wayne, finally has his epiphany, the resolution of the conflict is determined by who is the best brawler and boozer. With Irish music in the background.And, yes, I did cry at times during the flick. I really miss my wife."	3.0	The Sins of Our Fathers	2013-05-19	0	0	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A261TTWTMUMS70	"Thomas W. Tyler ""ttyle"""	The Quiet Man is more interesting than entertaining these days.  Interest stems from the manipulative techniques director John Ford used to sanitize the story's rather unpleasant heart, and from the psychology behind its characterizations.  Lifting the filter of Ford's sentimentalizing technique, at its core the film depicts the Irish as rustics, drunks and brawlers.  Women are nettlesome objects which, alas, must be dealt with.  How Ford manages to make all this seem entertaining is a combination of music, makeup, well-timed edits and the innate charm of some superb character actors, especially Barry Fitzgerald and Victor McLaglen.  Decades of hype to the contrary, there is no measurable electricity between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara.  Which ties into why the psychology behind the filmic interpretation of this story is particularly interesting:  O'Hara's recent autobiography claims that on a later film she caught  Ford in a liplock with Tyrone Power, and the DVD extras on this disk repeatedly mention how Ford purposely had Wayne drag O'Hara through ground full of manure, among other humiliations he sent her way.  Does a careful look at this movie tell us more about a tortured Irish-American's artistic soul than it does about a tortured Irish-American boxer?The picture quality on this DVD is poor - it looks about the same as it does when the movie gets its annual St. Patrick's Day over-the-air TV broadcast.  I suspect that at some point in the future a remastered DVD package of this film will be done, hopefully with some honest and intelligent DVD extras.  So if you can wait, you should.	3.0	These Days, More Interesting Than Entertaining	2005-09-15	23	7	16

The color in these old DVDs is so horribly washed out and blurred that I really felt as if I would never see the true version of the film.  It was like looking at Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling covered in 400 years of candle smoke and prior botched restorations.  These earlier DVDs were scans of bad transfers, probably from the VHS days, replicated over and over, degrading with each new transfer (if it says Artisan on the back cover, you know what I mean). There was no love for the movie until this release.  And what a difference.  Wow.From the opening scene to the final credits, it's as if this is a completely different movie.  And what a new movie.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A16GZ753UJ5FM1	Tom Fleeman	A wonderful story about an ex American boxer named Sean (Trooper) Thornton who returns to his homeland in Ireland on the Emerald Isle in the town of Innisfree to live a quiet peaceful life amongst his own people and the land of his childhood. He came home to start a new life after his last fight which resulted in a fatal knockout of his opponent at which time he vowed never to fight again. When Sean arrives, he buys an old thatched cottage which was owned by the wealthy but charitable Widow Tillane. Sean then meets his love, the red-headed strong-willed and materialistic Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), who just happens to be the sister of the toughest bully in the town, Squire Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen)who also wanted the little cottage but was bid out by Sean Thornton which of course would put them at odds against each other right of the bat not just because he outbid him, but because Danaher was courting for the Widow Tillane's affections, but things get a bit ugly when Sean starts showing an interest in his sister Mary Kate. This sets the story on it's way and with the other characters in this movie, it just gets more entertaining and often funny and musical with many Irish ballads being sang by all and let's not forget about the male bonding in the town pub with the dark beer and song. Beautiful cinematography with many shots taken on location in Ireland with wonderful scenery that will take your breath away. You will enjoy the character of Michaeleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald)who seems to take many different roles in the town, but he is very likable and entertaining and his character is one of only a few that actually knew Sean as a child. A very good and lighthearted movie and a movie that I believe John Wayne displayed a more gentle side of himself, but still tough when pushed too far, but still a classic John Wayne effort that leaves your irish eyes smiling. This movie is guaranteed to entertain people of all ages. It was very well done by a company that was supposedly doing low-budget &quot;B&quot; movies (Republic Pictures)and was one of John Fords favorite achievements as a producer and director and the only movie at the time that Republic Pictures made that was ever nominated for an oscar. Very well worth buying and a real nice addition to any John Wayne fans out there and it's a must have for any John Wayne film collection. I would recommend it highly.	5.0	John Wayne at his best!	2003-03-28	2	1	1

Also, when we pre-ordered it there was some question if the &#8220;Making Of&#8221; was included.  It is, but was not re-mastered.  The &#8220;Making Of&#8221; is about the same quality as the old VHS.  Big whip, I bought it for the move.  As far as I am concerned, the Making of is a nice bonus.  It is very informative.

There are many things to enjoyabout this movie . For one thing , the look of it. Shot in Irelandin gorgeous, rich technicolor, director John Ford's insistanceto film there rather than the Hollywood backlots means this isreally an Irish film. When Barry Fitzgerald's character says""ah, 'tis a nice, soft evening "", you can almost smell the softrain falling. There has never been a better Irishman in moviesthan Barry Fitzgerald. To those of us who have seen this filmmany times his lines & witty asides are a constant joy.The casting throughout is superb from Ward Bond's catholicpriest to Victor Mclagen's alpha male. The chemistry betweenJohn Wayne & Maureen O'Hara is natural & wonderful & must havebeen a film they both remembered fondly .

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2TMC4J69TXR4L	Tony	This movie is one of my all time favourite, watching numerous times. It's innocence, wit, and simplicity, make a joy to journey along in. Been to the film's locations, 60 years on, not much has changed, with all the charm, and beauty of a time gone still vivid, as one can imagine the church scene, fight scene, and so on, whilst standing at each place. The wizardry of John Ford, in piecing a film of such humanity, and understanding how it came about and was executed, only makes one appreciated and enjoy this timeless classic over & again.	5.0	All time favourite	2014-02-18	0	0	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A333J214SI1VFZ	"Tony Hughes ""stellarossa"""	More Irish stereotypes on parade here but in such affectionate fashion that it hardly matters. John Ford's homage to rural Ireland may include the odd unsavoury reference to the IRA but on the whole it is concerned mostly with John Wayne's return home to the poverty stricken countryside his parents obviously felt compelled to leave. Don't be fooled though, I loved this this and if I can set my cynicism aside so can you all. The climactic fight with Victor McLaglan - who was nominated for an Oscar for this - to the strains of the Fox Chase is one of the great sequences of all time.	4.0	&quot;Here's a good stick to beat the lovely lady with!&quot;	2003-10-28	3	3	0

He is generally in movies that are a type of ""shoot em up"", but he gives a wonderful understated performance. Maureen O'Hara is good, but also played this type of character many times. It is great though to hear her commentary. She tells fascinating and amusing recollections of the actors, the times and Ireland (she was born and raised in Dublin). I highly recommend watching the commentary after you have seen the movie. Ms. O'Hara also a good story as to how the movie was a favorite of John Ford's and how he had to deal his way into getting the moive made in the first place and in Ireland (for the most part).

After all, this is a very good movie by the best director that ever lived - John Ford.STAY AWAY FROM THIS VERSION. If it were a car it would be recalled.  Do not let your affection for the material convince you it is acceptable.On my TV, using component video imputes, it has the worst color of any DVD I've seen - with the possible exception of $4.99 bargins. The color saturation varies, going up and down at intervals. The detail is lousy. This looks like a third generation video copy. While the problem gets a little better towards the end, it is still very bad. This kind of treatment for a film that won an Oscar for cinematography? Ah, the profit motive.If you would like to see a great John Ford film on DVD where some care has been spent on restoration, try ""My Darling Clementine,"" ""The Searchers"" or ""The Grapes of Wrath.""Leonard Maltin hosts a ""making of"" short on the DVD.

Then he made what is probably the most ridiculous mis-representations of Ireland on film.  For anyone who is Irish-American, and who actually knows anything about Ireland, Ford's film is a painful travesty of all things Irish.  And yet every St. Patrick's Day, this awful movie is held up as some sort of representation.... There went the luck of the Irish.

Also, Amazon lumps all reviews for the same movie into a single set of reviews, so the VHS reviews are considered the same as DVDs and Blu-rays, etc.There have been so many complains in these reviews as to the remaster quality, but they don't say what version, so I had to take a gamble that this was a quality one.ProThe remaster is excellent.  Crystal clear.ConThe aspect ratio was a disappointment at old 4:3 (standard TV) as opposed to widescreen.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A30RO3SK9V7GUJ	William Lund	Just finished viewing the colectors edition of this timeless classic.  Maureen OHara's commentary soundtrack is wonderful.  The new documentary &quot;Remembering Ireland&quot; which features OHara, Andrew Mcglagen and John Wayne's son Patrick adds a great deal of appreciation of how this movie was brought to the screen by John Ford. Leonard Maltin &quot;Making of&quot; is OK, but I wish he would have been a little more on the ball and got interviews with several cast members when they were alive. (In 1990 when he did the documentary, Mildred Natwick(widow),Charles B. Fitzsimons (Hugh Forbes),James Lilburn,(Father Paul) were very much alive). Missing from this presentation is the original trailer.  Sad to say, this DVD edition still features a very soft image.  If you watch the first edition of this dvd, the original trailer allows you to see how clear and sharp the technicolor print was.

Others have already commented on the excellent quality of the Blu-Ray.  I got the regular DVD edition, and the image quality is head and shoulders above the terrible quality of the old Collectors Edition, which I purchased previously (I want my money back!).  The image quality of the 60th Anniversary is a little bit grainy, but the other than that excellent.  Colors are spot on, which was a problem with the old version.Definitely DO get the 60th Anniversary Edition, and avoid the Collectors Edition.Old review of Collectors Edition follows:I received the ""Collector's Edition"" version, the one with the commentary by Maureen O'Hara.  Some people had mentioned that they thought the picture quality of this one was ok.Don't believe it.  The picture quality is lousy, full of digital artifacts.Bottom line, do not buy this DVD, or this movie, until they fully restore/re-master it and get a good transfer from a proper print.

I wonder why Criterion hasn't jumped on this classic?Having said that, I wouldn't give this film a five star rating for either story line or acting -- it's a typical John Ford feel-good movie. But because of the strong Irish flavor of, I presume, a bygone era, it is enjoyable. I particularly get a kick out of Barry Fitzgerald's criticism of John Wayne's self-styled introduction to Maureen O'Hara, as she exits their Catholic church: ""Just who gave you permission to be playing patty cakes in the holy water?"" That slays me!I hope Criterion or someone will do right by this film eventually and then I'll buy it again. The current quality level makes me wonder if the distributors figure: Let them have chopped liver now and, when we eventually do it right, we'll sell it to them again. If that assumption is correct, it's time to get on with it!Addendum: HOORAY!!! Someone finally cleaned up this classic to Blu-ray (and perhaps Criterion standards) and made it much more enjoyable! Of course, also I must give credit to the OPPO BDP103 Blu-ray player that's rated tops by Consumer Reports and which I recently purchased from Amazon.

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2UBPL7XZGDAER	W. Ord	In My humble opinion, This was the greatest movie ever made. If you are a fan of John Wayne and having the lovely Maureen O'Hara along side of him, you can fail. It has made my day and many more to follow.	5.0	The Quiet Man	2007-11-22	2	1	1

OREILLY	"For a film that John Ford insisted be shot intechnicolor and won an oscar for cinematography,Artisan Home Entertainment should be scolded forreleasing such a poor original transfer. Using adigital DLP projector the movie showed color fading,fuzzy edges (at times) and numerous old film glitches.However, the movie is the best that is out there andquite watchable nonetheless.After having viewed this classic, out of curiosityI played Disney's technicolor ""Darby O'Gill"". What a difference!Sharp and vibrant a visual delight ... done right."	5.0	Shame on Artisan	2006-11-25	4	4	0

One of my favorite John Wayne movies although I'm not in general a huge fan, mainly because I don't like westerns.This movie is not a western but a really good story of a guy trying to find a new life in his homeland of Ireland.The Blu-ray is a HUGE upgrade over the DVD, much better picture and sound.	5.0	Finally Blu-ray!	2013-03-29	0	0	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AYTVY9HUAJLYK	"WritingIrish ""LM Killian"""	I purchased both this - The Quiet Man (Collector's Edition) -- and the 60th edition collector's edition.  I think the video quality in both is fine, but I am watching it on a 44&#34; and 32&#34; digital TV using regular DVD players (not blueray).  There were a few seconds on the larger TV where the video blurred a bit, but I don't know if that was my DVD player sputtering or the digital tv adjusting.  The video quality of the 60th edition seems a bit better than the other, but not particularly noticeable enough that I would return either one or recommend one over the other.  The main difference in these sets is that only the 1st (The Quiet Man Collector's Edition) has an interview with Maureen O'Hara in her later years, along with bios (read on screen) on all the actors with their films.  Both editions have a brief film hosted by critic Leonard Maltin about the making of the Quiet Man that's decent.  Only the 60th edition has a printed book with detail about the history of the film.  OUtside of that, it's a great movie!  I personally preferred the Quiet Man Collectors edition.	5.0	The Quiet Man (Collector's Edition)	2013-04-21	0	0	0

6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"If you ask most people alive today what the ""legacy"" of actor John Wayne will forever be, they will most likely respond ""a swaggering, confident cowboy who always defeated the bad guys and rode off into the sunset"".  Though a good portion of his films (Rio Bravo, El Dorado, The Sons of Katie Elder, etc.) followed that very theme, the Duke's REAL legacy is the nuanced roles he played so well, not the standard Western fare.Just think back to some of Wayne's best screen performances and what types of characters he played:-Red River (Thomas Dunson; threatens to kill his adoptive son)-The Searchers (Ethan Edwards; nearly murders his little niece in cold blood)-The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (Tom Doniphon; a psychological mess by the end of the film)-True Grit (Rooster Cogburn; a tottering old drunk who, at times, can hardly stay on his horse)Clearly, Wayne actually thrived as an actor when not stereotyped as the heroic cowboy, and his performance in ""The Quiet Man"" only serves to advance that sentiment.In ""Quiet Man"", Wayne plays Sean Thornton, a seemingly retiring fellow who is returning to his hometown of Innisfree in Ireland.  While there, he meets the woman of his dreams, Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), and tries to start a new life for himself after being disgraced in the United States as a boxer who killed a fellow pugilist in the ring.  However, Thornton quickly discovers that the courting customs in Innisfree are radically different from those in the States, as he must first persuade Mary Kate's brother, Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), to give up his sister's hand in marriage.While that brief plot description above pretty much describes the gist of the film, leaving it at that would be like saying The Searchers was just about cowboys and Indians.  In typical John Ford (director) fashion, this film is filled with nuances that can only be caught after multiple viewings.  Whether it be Wayne's reactions to the extremely odd dating rituals, or the strange characters he meets while getting reacquainted with Innisfree, Ford fills the picture with all kinds of little trivialities and inside jokes.Not only that, but the acting and music in this film are spectacular.  Wayne and O'Hara turn in what some may consider to be their strongest acting performances every (or, at the very least, their strongest together), while the rest of the cast is full of funny and interesting characters.  Add to that an incredible score that captures the Irish roots of the film, and you really do have a film for the ages.  By the time Sean Thornton makes his trip through town in advance of his final confrontation with Will Danaher, you will be rooting him on every step of the way.Some time ago, my Dad started a tradition of viewing ""The Quiet Man"" once a year...on (or very near) St. Patrick's Day, in keeping with the film's Irish bend.  I was a participant in that annual tradition not too long ago, and let's just say that I will be continuing it into the future."	5.0	Breaking the Boundaries of John Wayne's Perception	2009-03-25	0	0	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A2B8GXSCB1R05T	Zack Davisson	Not being a huge John Wayne fan, I was introduced to &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; by my Grandmother.  It ended up being a good flick, and alot of fun all around.  I have often heard of &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; being called the &quot;different&quot; John Wayne film, and maybe this is so.  It lacks much of the brutish machismo that I associate with the actor, and has a good spirit instead.Maureen O'Hara is great as the spunky Irish lass,  Mary Kate Danaher.  Her character is as perplexing as it is fun.  John Wayne is Sean Thorton, a former Irish, now American seeking the peace of his home town.  This is definitely Hollywood's romantic 1950's view of Ireland, full of smart-tongued men with smiling eyes and a belly full of beer and hot-tempered red-haired lasses looking for a real man to tame them.  It is alot of  fun if you don't take it too seriously or look too closely into the plot.  Much like &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; in that way.Of course there are hijinks and mishaps, and the whole thing ends in a classic brawl, maybe the best filmed brawl I have ever seen.  Thanks Gran!	5.0	A heck of a good brawl	2002-12-08	2	2	0
6302320488	The Quiet Man [VHS]	A3L1ZOFNN3CTFN	"""znidersd"""	This is a great movie to watch around St. Patrick's Day, as it takes place in Ireland.  There's comedy, love, John Wayne... what more could you want?  Really, it's just a great storyline about an ex-boxer coming to Ireland and falling in love, but jumping over some of the pastoral customs of the area.	5.0	Great movie for St. Patty's Day	2002-05-27	1	0	1
