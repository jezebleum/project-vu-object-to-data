B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	`The Station Agent' is one of those rare movies that lingers through your memory long after having watched it.  Not since `Lars and the Real Girl' have I felt this way about a quirky independent film where you fall in love with the characters and marvel at the warmth and eccentricity they elicit.The movie starts with Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage, `In Bruges') a dwarf (at least that's the term he prefers, so I'll go along with him) who works as a fix-it man at a used goods store.  Despite the tool man position, he's sharply dressed with a collared shirt and tie.  His moves are mundane, and the store's atmosphere is serene and quiet.  The deliberations of his life are similar.  He goes shopping.  He lives alone.  He doesn't have any companionship, and whatever entertainment he ekes out is spent by himself.  Then the owner of the shop (Paul Benjamin) dies.Soon Finbar learns that he's inherited a train station depot from his deceased employer.  The shop is sold with its merchandise, so he pursues his newfound possession, nestled in a sleepy New Jersey neighborhood where much renovation is needed .He's able to live in the station depot where in former times the thriving railroad stop provided a barber shop and a familiar store with convenience items.  (Although the trains that go through every night make sleep difficult.) Within a few yards of him is Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale, `Romance & Cigarettes') a Latino who runs his ailing father's hot dog and coffee vending stand from a trailer.  Joey is gregarious and friendly with his new neighbor.  His overtures, however, fall flat on the taciturn Finbar whose silence speaks volumes about the ordeals he endures about his height.The two get caught up as a threesome when a separated housewife, Olivia Harris  (Patricia Clarkson `Lars and the Real Girl') nearly runs Finbar over on the road juggling with the distracted driver syndrome we're all used to.  Trying to make it up to him, Olivia  finds a social context in which all three can get involved together.  Finbar finally opens up.  Eventually, they each have something to give one another, and the tripod becomes more complete with four when Finbar becomes infatuated with the local librarian (Michelle Williams) and extends to five when Cleo (Raven Goodwin), a curious and precocious African-American girl, shares his company and fascination about trains.The differences between the three characters is so clever, yet uncanny, you can hardly believe how well their chemistry works together.  Whether gathering at Olivia's house and art gallery, going train chasing with two amateur filmmakers whose heights are at a great distance, or just sharing a meal, the movie gels with unusual sparkle and grace.The film demonstrates that in the midst of the usual hustle and bustle a dwarf will especially be treated like he's invisible target and in the way.  But they all have hurdles to leap over.  In Olivia's split marriage arrangement some past secrets come creeping back into her life, and Joey's outgoing vivacity has little time and space when caring for a sick father.Colorful, charming, and engaging `The Station Agent' is one of those gems that make you wish independent movies were always this good.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	ARHUBLVXF8PGF	Aaa	Why is it that directors who set movies in the Garden State almost always depict it as a parallel universe? (OK, don't answer.) Still, boring is boring, even if it's quirky-boring. In The Station Agent, an urban dwarf with an attitude moves to East Bumblepuck, New Jersey and finds that there are worse things than being short. In the process of self-discovery, he meets a variety of  quirky characters, including the world's dumbest mobile food cart owner, who has set up his hot-dog stand on a rural road with LITERALLY ZERO TRAFFIC; a pregnant teen-age librarian with a heart of gold and a Neanderthal boyfriend; and a very annoying sixth-grader. Lesson from the movie: Don't get really really drunk and then walk on a train track by yourself late at night. Like the movie itself, it's NOT RECOMMENDED.	2.0	More Jersey Quirky...	2005-10-01	32	7	25

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1H14URYBRPVA1	Abiola. J. Sonubi	Well, I couldn't but write about this one. Though probably just another regular Amazon purchaser, I'm not a habitual writer of reviews except i personally feel a movie/ CD is exceptional (good or otherwise). This one really deserves a mention and boy! it also merits all the accolades it received (22 worldwide award wins in total), not that awards always translate to mean quality but when one them is a BAFTA award then it's got to be worthy, yep! the Bafta is indeed a much more credible 'seal of quality'.I really have to recommend this movie as it just completely 'hits the spot' and there were loads of times that we spontaneously burst out in uncontrollable fits of roaring laughter probably upsetting the (by now frustrated) neighbours. As with the general synopsis and personal opinions all of which i agree with e.g one from top reviewer Joseph H (somewhere above), it's a movie about a (possibly taunted by the mainstream world & subsequently tired) deeply reclusive, train/ railway lover, Fin (Peter Dinklage, someone i feel should be taken seriously as an actor) and his journey to and stay in New Jersey, all as a result of his dead employer's surprise estate bequeathal ... he eventually turns out to be the star of this NJ outback with all those that really got to know him being genuinely drawn to him, his mental wisdom & courage and not out of pity/ amusement because of his dwarfism. It's one of those movies that remind or make us come to realize that spending time with, getting to know and understanding people & things can really change our sometimes bigoted, tainted outlook and approaches.The movie is a drama/ comedy and one that MAKES ALL THE SENSE in the world, I think it's one that anybody or family should/ could watch on a day when there's time to catch a movie. Every character in the movie contributes at least one very funny scene, starting from the young, persistent, 'free spirit' black girl, right down to the library attendant, phew!!! I laughed pretty much all the way through it and that's hardly something one sees in many drama movies, some comedies might achieve this with that odd bit of the producer's or script writer's (just for kicks) senseless scenery here and there.Two of my funniest scenes remain 'Post-drinking, morning after' scenes, the first of which was when Olivia (Patricia Clarkson the Emmy winning, Oscar and Screen Actors' Guild nominee) overslept at Fin's house and the coffee/ hotdog dude Joe (Emmy winning, Will & Grace actor Bobby Cannavale) saw her leaving the house and the second scene was the reverse, when Fin and the coffee dude overslept at Olivia's and someone saw them. Some other more thoughtful, more sobering scenes include when Fin gets drunk in the bar and eventually crashes out seemingly paralyzed on the rail tracks which (being a true train lover) apparently was his routine daily way back home, with that oncoming train, Gosh!!! The scene then leads to one with the discovery of Olivia's unconscious body on the floor.All round good acting and I have to make a mention of the commendable child actress Raven Goodwin, who even by her pre-teen years had already been recognized with a Screen Actors' Guild and also the Black reel award nominations. Bobby Cannavale aka Joe, is extremely hillarious in most parts and i'm still laughing even as i write this.Considering the movie's current going price even here on Amazon (approx $10 or 5), it's indeed a bargain for that much needed stress detox.	5.0	Auto route to detox	2007-05-27	3	3	0
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A35QF1GDLAFYCL	"A. Calabrese ""othernj"""	This is a wonderful little film.  The Characters are great and the dialogue is even better.  Peter Dinklage is superb as Finn, a person who has to let go of the secure world he tolerates and join a new world with people, he at first, really doesn't much care for.  The supporting cast, that includes Bobby Cannavale and Patricia Clarkson as Joe and Olivia really lift this movie.  The movie is a metaphor for how people move on and how some people can help others move on.  I have one minor complaint, on the DVD you get  to watch some deleted scenes, why some of these scenes were deleted seems to make no sense.  The Stations Agent is a great movie with a good story, buy it.	5.0	The Station Agent Gets You To Where You Want To Go	2005-02-19	3	3	0
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AQUU8S55JGY2H	Aco	This is a terrific, sweet film. All three leads are distinct and satisfying, with special mention towards Dinklage. He is the pivitol character and the best too.The story is very straight forward, with an opening about Finn's life in Hoboken at a train shop and subsequent move to rural New Jersey where he rapidly meets Clarkson's Olivia and Cannavale's Joe. Together the three navigate each other into their lives, in what amounts to a stirring and heartfelt story of friendship and peace. This is a very soothing, moving film.The extras on the DVD are minimal. Several deleted scenes and commentaries by director McCarthy, Dinklage and Cannavale. The film itself is the best part.	5.0	A Beautiful Film	2004-11-01	2	1	1
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3J1A72P9CY06I	Adam Gonnerman	"The characters in this movie are brilliantly portrayed, creating a sweet tedium in waiting and hoping that they will do or say something good.  This is rather than being an artsy drag.  If you are looking for a fast, flashy movie...then just keep moving.  If you have the patience for it, though, ""The Station Agent"" can be a worthwhile and restful way to pass an afternoon off from work."	4.0	Not Your Typical Hollywood Fare	2004-12-29	4	3	1
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1F545WKUBCB0J	ADAM J COHEN	The movie The Station Agent creates 3, endearing characters who are both unique and familiar.  Each has his own burden in life and prior to meeting lived fairly isolated, but together, form a bond and friendship.  The movie itself has a unique style and pace that stands out.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1SAGYN46CJ1N9	"A. Hudson ""A. Hudson"""	My husband is a train buff and has ridden trains all over the country for years just for the enjoyment of it.  This movie was recommended by a relative who told us it had a lot of train information in it.  There was not a lot of train information and we thought it was a bit slow and dull.  We did not enjoy it as much as we thought we would based on the recommendation we were given.  It was &#34;okay&#34; and the actors did a good job.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A4B23XPC82X5J	Alan J. Laibson	It's an interesting character study of three people.  They are all either dysfunctional, damaged or limited by family constraints.  Over time they learn how to co-exist together in a more healthy manner.  What I thought was interesting to see was what a 'little person's' daily reality looks like and how painful it can be.  I thought all of the actors did a great job in playing their character and you could feel their pain.  Many of the scenes with very little dialogue were the most painful to watch because the characters were stuck with their own reality and you could tell it was crushing them.  When they finally are able to accept one another for what they are, push themselves beyond the boundaries that are stifling their growth a peaceful truce is reached.  I enjoyed the movie.	3.0	A study in emotional growth	2014-04-02	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A23L2BR07AOBG1	alex bushman	It's also a viewpoint that not a lot of people think about, including myself and it's so rare for me to run into a dwarf that I almost have to look twice just to confirm what I see and I feel horrible for it.  This movie truly seeks to include such a person even when that person is unwilling at first.  The only real criticism that this movie can take is that it doesn't really care about telling a story and yet there are things filling up the time called subplots and none of these things actually come to fruition and results in an unsatisfying ending, but that's not to say that this film doesn't have it's merits, it does.  While being very welcoming it doesn't contain much dialogue.  The dialogue that it contains is very short and brief.  I'm not sure if that's the influence of the main character, or simply because the screenwriter is ADD.  Ultimately, none of this matters because the film is really about the main character and showing his situation.  As that, it succeeds very well and it doesn't attempt to be charming at all, which is a positive.  It also features a performance by Michelle Williams that's a small supporting role, but it lets her put down the glam card and just look like an ordinary  and natually beautiful woman, which is nice.  Her romance with Dinklage (the main character) is very cute as well.	3.0	A good character study of one man's experience in the world	2005-04-01	8	2	6
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3GLX47PF4ZN9T	Alex	Peter Dinklage is a force in The Station Agent, playing a train geek/little person to such perfection that we come to completely know this character despite never having met anyone like him before. Bobby Cannavale is perfect as a dumb jock desperate for company, and Patricia Clarkson's awkward love interest is completely real. The acting is superb all around, and the cinematography keeps the quiet plot engaging.My one complaint is that the climax is cliche and unoriginal. It's a sign of the director's talent that it's still completely watchable.	5.0	what a delightful movie!	2009-08-31	0	0	0
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A39IBJB2PBVC7I	Alistair McHarg	Gentle, irresistible, surreal and almost perfect. Worth owning because it holds up well under repeated viewings. Three bruised people, hiding from the world beneath very different kinds of veneers, form a precarious but significant friendship that changes them as they come to know and care about each other. Finbar McBride, the Station Agent, is a dwarf who is more than tired of the attention he draws. Peter Dinklage landed several choice roles after this performance and he deserved them, his performance is amazing.The pace of Station Agent is slow, it winds leisurely like a lumbering commuter train. Finbar's anger is given plenty of time to smolder before he explodes. By the time he does you are rooting for him, you care about him, you would forgive him anything. Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale are equally engaging and sympathetic. Really an exceptional and wonderful movie.	5.0	All Aboard!	2006-01-02	5	5	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2QHM5HBSIXRL4	Andy Orrock	'The Station Agent' is an understated gem.  If you're the type of person that gravitates towards movies in which the protagonists land on an asteroid to blow it up and save Earth from sure destruction, well, 'The Station Agent' is probably not your cup of tea.  If, however, you appreciate a movie with sneaky charm, sparse but meaningful dialogue, and personal interactions that seem pulled from real life, not scripted, then you're going to enjoy this film a lot.Patricia Clarkson is always excellent.  While I think 'Pieces of April' is her masterpiece (and I'm not alone), she's in top form here.  Peter Dinklage deserves kudos, too.  Film buffs remember Dinklage's scene-stealing debut in 'Living in Oblivion.'  If you've seen Dinklage out of character on TV, you've seen what a lively, chatty guy he can be.  So, his turn here as an introspective man of few words represents a nice stretch of acting.  My top praise goes to Bobby Cannavale.  He's such an engaging screen presence.  His 'likability' quotient is off the charts.  The second you see Cannavale, a smile will start to form on your lips.  He's a joy to watch.  Check him out in the US remake of 'Shall We Dance?' in which he effortlessly steals scene after scene from Richard Gere.	4.0	Low-wattage charmer with a trio of fine performances	2007-03-03	4	4	0
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3QGKUX3M9H9J1	Angelique	What a lovely film this is!  It is truly a breath of fresh air.  I am as big a fan of the big blockbuster movies as most people, but this film is for the quiet moments.  Beautiful photography, understated dialogue, and an intense focus on facial expressions make this film a very intimate experience.  Friends oftentimes happen unexpectedly and come in all shapes and sizes.  Friendship is all about tolerance, acceptance, and the joy of laughing together.  That is the beauty of this film - the surprising joy of unexpected friendship.  I am in still in awe two days after seeing it for the first time.  A film rarely does this to me, so it has to be good!!!!In an age when most films have budgets the size of the national deficit (almost), it is nice to see a low-key film that is so powerful!

The Peter Dinklage character is wry and smart and handsome.  Patricia Clarkson is heartrending as a bereaved mother, and the Bobby Cannavale character who has reluctantly taken over his father's hot dog truck is awesome as he cluelessly and doggedly harasses the other characters into friendship and out of their shells.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AUT9HSLT32RGJ	"Arthur P. Haviland Jr. ""AirshowFan"""	While Peter Dinklage does an excellent job acting in the role of Finnbar McBride, a dwarf who is fascinated with trains, some unlikely events in the film detract. When Finn is leaving Hoboken to go to Newfoundland, 35 niles away, he walks along the busy NJ Transit tracks. A true railfan would not trespass like that and no tracks go directly from Hoboken to Newfoundland. While it would be possible to go through Hawthorne, NJ to get to the Susquehanna tracks that lead to Newfoundland, it would not be a route that someone could walk without getting arrested. Once he gets to Newfoundland, his interactions with Joe and Olivia are credible and his resistance to appear in front of Cleo's school class is understandable. After Finn gets drunk in the bar and is walking home on the tracks, he is run over by a train but survives, another unlikely event. If Finn had simply taken a bus from Hoboken (or the Port Authority bus terminal in NY) to Newfoundland, this film would have had a better beginning. Despite his determination to live in isolation, Finn discovers that people will not let this happen. Patricia Clarkson portrays her role of Olivia well and she helps this movie to the three stars. Bobby Cannavale is credible as Joe Oramas. If you are a railfan and looking for some train photos, there are a few of NJ Transit trains in the beginning of the film and Susquehanna RR trains in Newfoundland but they are brief. Without the unlikely events of walking to Newfoundland by the tracks and surviving getting run over by a train, this was an enjoyable movie.	3.0	unlikely events limit this film	2011-04-01	14	1	13

This is a good movie to watch to grow as a person because you grow in your understanding of the pain and loneliness of a person, one who grows up and stays at home to take care of his father, two who survives the death of a young child and subsequent, related divorce, and three who is a dwarf.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2C27IQUH9N1Z	audrey	Sometimes friendships form through common interests, sometimes through circumstance.  Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a dwarf who works in a train hobbyist shop and associates only with other train enthusiasts; however, when his elderly employer dies and leaves him an abandoned train depot, he travels to the Jersey wilderness to set up a new life, and there he meets people very different from himself -- Olivia, a grieving divorcee; Joe, a loud and nosy hotdog vendor; a curious local librarian; and a young train enthusiast.  Not having much in common, nevertheless friendships develop here, and it is fun to watch, as the performances are universally strong and the script is well-written and interesting.  Watching the interactions between Fin and Joe are especially fun.DVD extras are sparse but enjoyable and include: a commentary track with writer-director Tim McCarthy and the three leads; deleted scenes, including an alternate ending; trailers.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1CQGAPQMN41LV	"A. Whitehead ""Werthead"""	I picked up this movie on DVD a while ago as it had good reviews and was very cheap (it's currently about 4 on Amazon.co.uk), but I'd never gotten round to watching it. When I heard that its director, Tom McCarthy, and one of its stars, Peter Dinklage, had been signed up for HBO's adaption of George RR Martin's novel A Game of Thrones, it seemed like a good time to give it a go.The plot is reasonably straightforward. Dinklage plays Fin, a young man suffering from dwarfism. Tired of having people comment on his height, Fin is a withdrawn man who seeks solace in his hobby of studying trains and his job working in a model train shop with his friend Henry. When Henry dies unexpectedly, Fin inherits a piece of property, an old train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey, and moves in, hoping to continue his life of solitude.Fin soon finds himself uncomfortably drawn into the lives of several other people. Joe is a garrulous, friendly guy running the local ice cream van on behalf of his father, who is ill. A local woman, Olivia, almost accidentally runs Fin over and in her attempts to make amends they form an interesting friendship. A somewhat less-developed storyline sees Fin attract the attention of Emily, the local young librarian, who is having her own problems.The Station Agent is a curious movie, which for most of its length seems to be heading down the 'heartwarming relationship drama' route before the director suddenly veers away from the threat of cliche city into a new and more interesting direction. It's a short movie (only 90 minutes) but it has a laidback pace, focusing on the characters, dialogue and their slowly building relationships in a well-developed manner. As well as Dinklage in an outstanding role, Patricia Clarkson as Olivia and Bobby Cannavale give excellent performances as Patricia and Joe, the former playing a badly damaged character and the latter being that slightly overbearing, slightly too friendly type of person I think most people have met at some point in their lives. Michelle Williams has a much slighter role as Emily but makes the most of her scenes.The late-stage shift in the narrative is an interesting move. Without giving away spoilers, the way that McCarthy avoids corny resolutions to the character arcs and deftly subverts expectations of a neat ending is well-done. He doesn't go bonkers and kill everyone or turn one of the characters into a psychopath, but he also doesn't go down the totally corny route either. It's a thought-provoking way of concluding the film that works well, although it took me a while to get into its headspace.The Station Agent (****) is a quiet, funny, entertaining and occasionally emotionally intense movie that is well worth a watch. As a piece of character drama, it is a rousing success and fills me with great hope for the HBO project.	4.0	A well-done character piece	2009-05-11	2	2	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1AOFTWRM3O14O	BAMADAN	"Fin(Peter Dinklage) works and lives in a hobby train shop where he apparently pays his rent by repairing and making model trains. It is no secret that he is afflicted with dwarfism and the fact that he works on miniature trains as opposed to the regular-sized is no coincidence. When the owner of the shop suddenly dies, Fin finds out that he was willed an old train depot in rural Newfoundland, New Jersey. Fin doesn't have many possessions and doesn't know how to drive, so he simply ""walks the right of way"" to his new home where he can be away from other humans.The charm of this film is not in the typical Hollywood ""victim becomes hero"" plot, but the fact that people are just people and everyone has their own problems. When Fin reluctantly meets other people in the rural town, MOST of them don't seem to care one way or the other what his stature is. Fin seems to almost search for a reason not to care about these people, but inevitably he cannot avoid true friendship without pretense.Some of the things you will not see in this movie are what make it outstanding. There is no great struggle with an evil force, no gratuitous nudity, violence, language(the ""f"" word is used as just another adjective because that's how a young guy from New Jersey talks), or heroism by the lead character. Whenever Fin encounters some passing ridicule by either kids or ""adults"" he doesn't give it a second thought because he's heard it all before.Fin simply wants to be alone and discovers that he can be alone as long as he can share his loneliness with others. The closing scene is especially effective because it leaves you wanting more, which I think might have been intentional because the characters seemed at that point to be feeling the same way as the audience. They wanted more out of each other, but the credits rolled."	4.0	Group loneliness	2006-05-01	3	3	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AADSY2ESRML3R	Beatle Freak	To say this movie moved slowly would be a disservice to the term.  Snails and turtles are light speed compared to this cinematic disaster.  To even begin to say there is a story revolving around this film is a stretch as the dialogue is so empty and rudderless.  The only suspense in this movie comes in wondering when it will (God willing) end.  We spent 2 nights watching this movie (could not get through it on one) and came away feeling like we had been completely taken.  Those who are rating this film highly have to be on the production staff.If you are mad at someone, recommend they watch this movie.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1DLOTMQOALNI0	Becky B.	I got lost in the revery of this film and then all of a sudden it was over.  I felt disappointed because I wanted it to continue, to see how the characters faired in the next moment.  Peter Dinklage is terrific in the film - he IS the station agent, though Amazon doesn't even list him under main or supporting characters!  He plays a loner, a person who avoids other people because of the ridicule they typically heap on him for his size.  He hesitantly befriends two other main characters - an artist who is alone, trying to heal from the death of her child, and a garrulous young man who parks his food truck all day at an abandoned train depot in the middle of nowhere.This is a slow, quiet, deep character study of three decent and caring people who have chosen or are forced by circumstances to live on the fringes of society.  It is also a comment on the isolation and the comradeship that we all experience.  Highly recommended.	5.0	A quiet, deep revery	2014-04-27	0	0	0
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A35KMUCK6WILYU	Becky S. Curtis	Three people with great needs (woman who can't get over the loss of her child and divorced), dwarf who hides his intimate thoughts and anger behind a wall of protection and living in an abandoned train station, and a handsome man who makes a meager living and takes care of his ailing elderly father).  The movie showed how they each filled a gap and provided support to one another, how their relationships were tried through trials, but how they came together again.  The young man reached out to both the dwarf and then to the woman to establish an unlikely friendship that survived the test.  The woman then reached out to the dwarf.  After parting ways, it was the dwarf who reached out to the woman in her need and then to the man who responded to the request to help the woman.  They all needed one another and fulfilled that gap of loneliness and need.  Sad, but interesting and even brought a smile of relief at the end.	3.0	Interesting look at unexpected relationships	2014-03-25	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AR37967IAR6ZT	Benjamin	Tom McCarthy's THE STATION AGENT is about a man who likes trains far more than he likes people. He just wants to sit and read, walk along the train tracks watching locomotives pass and keep to himself. He doesn't think there's really much particularly interesting about his manner, and he doesn't really have much need for friends or attention.But Fin was born a dwarf, which is likely what motivates him to remain isolated and what motivates gawkers, jarringly rude people and sentimental souls to take an interest.At the beginning of THE STATION AGENT, we see Fin, brilliantly played by the talented and actually quite handsome Peter Dinklage, go about his life amongst a rude population until his sole friend in the world dies. Though Fin is sad, of course, he inherits land with an old, isolated train depot on it - and he ventures to it so that he can finally live without bother from other people.But like it does with all of us sometimes, the world will just not leave Fin alone - no matter how much he craves silence and isolation.Fate, I guess, knows that Fin needs people, needs friendships, needs ties to the outside world, so it provides him with new friends Joe and Olivia, played by Bobby Cannavale and the always-excellent Patricia Clarkson. Joe runs his father's catering van that he parks everyday outside the train station, even though it barely gets any traffic and Joe himself cannot stand being alone because he can't stop talking. Olivia is a perpetually distracted artist who lives in a nearby house and comes by Joe's stand and the station everyday because they're her only real connection to the outside world.Because they ask Fin more about his interests and his life than about his condition, he finds himself opening up to them.Through Joe and Olivia, who is masking some very real problems of her own, Fin is able to change his life. Somewhat. And the story of these friendships and these unique characters are what give THE STATION AGENT its considerable charm.I identified with Fin's character personally because I was born with a disability as well. With a disability, you find sometimes that you want people to acknowledge your differences, and other times you'd rather be accepted and not stared at. THE STATION AGENT gives Fin distinct moments when he attempts to either thwart attention or grab it, not sure of how he himself feels toward what makes him physically different. It's a smart film that can do that, that can allow a character to both embrace and fight against adversity at the same time.Because that compromise is difficult in life, the film ends on an ambivalent note, but with one of hope, and I found that fitting.I recommend it because it knows what its character is going through, knows why he's going through it and knows that there are no easy answers to his situation.It also knows that sometimes you just shouldn't be alone.	4.0	Fin McBride just wants to be alone.	2004-10-18	23	19	4

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1MR1VMK999I6O	"Beth DeRoos ""Beth DeRoos from the California ..."	Have you ever watched a movie and forgotten you were even watching a movie, because you seemed to be sitting on the sidelines observing?  This is that kind of movie and its wonderful because the acting is so seamless that you literally forget you are watching men and women playing a part. Instead you are watching real characters come to life.And I think because the director allowed stillness and quiet reflection to speak, that the movie says so much.  It literally makes the adage a picture says a thousand words a reality. Peter Dinklage becomes the quiet reclusive man in the old no longer used train station, who then opens up.  And the director. writer made his character so real by all the interesting facts about trains and the railroad, which any train buff will love. Even the question about blimps, made me want to look up facts about blimps.The scenery is spectacular and used well. Bobby Cannavale plays the owner of a mobile coffee stand and is someone you might actually know if your live in a small town.  Patricia Clarkson plays an artist who has lost a son and now her marriage and is in a deep deep depression.  The Librarian and other characters are a good addition to the film.The vulnerability of Finbar McBride played by Peter Dinklage, like when the boyfriend of a young woman whom Finbar has befriended starts hitting on her and Finbar steps in and wants him to stop, yet being a dwarf  he cant do much and needs to actually protect himself.Also appreciated this movie because it was thoughtful, mature and didnt resort to nudity, violence and other cheap movie tricks to keep the viewers attention.  Love serious movies that stimulate my  brain and then my eyes.Reminds each of us that we have areas where we to are vulnerable and scared.  The mix of characters actually reminded me of an Mary Englebriet quote that says 'Friends are the Family we choose for ourselves'.	5.0	WOW What a wonderful must see and own film	2007-08-27	4	4	0

These don't matter. It's a character study. No one gets shot. No car chases. Lovely.	3.0	Sweet story, but nothing happens	2010-01-04	7	4	3
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1MF557P7RJ971	B. R. Blackshaw	This is a great film. Written and produced with its three principal actors in mind, The Station Agent tells a universal tale of everyday discrimination and everyday feelings surrounding a disused station and its new owner. Told with integrity and wit you fall in love with the characters and their rleationships and really don't want the story to end.Peter Dinklage is superb as are his cohorts. Watch out also for the quirky and very original musical score.On a number of levels this film entertains, engages and satisfies.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A38JAD2QDZI8GO	"B. Viloria ""dodomaster"""	The Station Agent is not a seriously involved movie that will leave you at the edge of your seat.  It is not your typical Hollywood slam bam and gratituitous violence and sex.  It is rather a simple excursion to our fears, our human conditions, our grasping for acceptance, our attempts at emotional stability, our belief in what's fundamentally proper, and most importantly, its an illusion of life brought to film by such talented actors.  Dinkladge and Clarkson gave remarkable performances in such a low-key movie, probably no one has ever heard of.  The movie paces itself in a slow monotonous, if somewhat unbelievably naive, manner.  The ending itself was somewhat trite and abruptly non-alarming, but in the end, we all understand what great pleasure it was to actually experience an hour and a half minutes of all these emotional rollercoaster rolled up into a heartfelt dramatic performance.To call this movie boring would be one thing.  To call this movie a call to our heart strings would be more appropriate.  Try it and experience it yourself.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	"Peter Dinklage, as Finnbar McBride, is outstanding in this movie. I enjoyed him in the TV Series ""Threshold"" and was sorely disappointed in it's cancellation. I was pleasantly surprised when I ran across his performance in this movie. If you enjoy excellent movies about unusual people becoming friends, then this should be up your alley. I haven't seen one this good since ""Tell Me You Love Me, Junie Moon"". Thank God at least this one is on DVD. This will appeal to most people, but especially to any that enjoy indie movies. The movie starts with two men working at a train hobby shop. One dies and leaves the other a small rural train station.All the hobby shops assets are liquidated so he must move to the station agent office at the train station. The Station Agents office may be small and old, but it has character. Just like four new townspeople he meets. A gregarious hot dog vendor introduces himself on Finnbar's arrival to his new home. Once he thinks Finn is attractive to the ladies, he won't leave him alone. Soon after he meets a mature married woman that has lost a son and has a rocky marriage and likes to paint faces without eyes. Then a pregnant librarian and a grade schooler that wants him to be her show and tell. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family.

While the main character is, yes, a Dwarf, the story does not center on his disability but his desire for isolation from being hurt as a result of it. Many of us can identify with this desire for all of us have been deeply hurt at one time or another.

This is a film whose plot envelops the viewer as opposed to develops; the viewer has to trust the story.  Its strength is in its subtlety.And there are good reasons to trust the film.  The acting is superb as is the cast. The direction plays up the film's inherent strengths without overpowering it. One Amazon reviewer referred to this film as a compelling character study and I wholeheartedly agree.The film is a quiet character study.  Those who confuse ""quiet"" with ""boring"" miss so much.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3U81IP3GEMURJ	"Charles S. Williams ""SCI fan"""	"I am a train enthusiast who heard about this film through friends who are also interested in the hobby. I wasn't sure what to expect but, after reading several reviews, wanted to see it. It was absolutely incredible, and the other 500 or so folks who ventured out on a cold and snowy Friday afternoon to see a cinema society screening seemed to enjoy it as well. The surroundings and the receptive audience only made the movie that much better.It's hard to describe the movie to friends...a movie about a dwarf who likes trains and inherits an abandoned depot. I simply tell them that it is about so much more than trains. But there are those ""been there, done that"" moments to which railfans will relate: screening home movies of trains in a dark room filled with railfans, and chasing trains (although I have never had as much fun as the characters had in this movie). I will let others talk about all of the other plot points, etc. If you are a train fan, see it...you will see yourself (and, oh, the thought of owning a depot and cars next to a track). If you are a movie fan, see it...it is a tremendous production. If you have a pulse, see it...it is a moving, touching, wonderful, funny, sparkling movie. Make your friend see it. I did, and they loved it (one even ended up at a complex which was also showing porn movies, but that didn't deter them from enjoying the movie). I will own it when it comes out on DVD and loan it to all of my friends. See it!"	5.0	Simply a wonderful movie. See it!	2004-02-05	9	9	0
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3N7G6DY8I6UYX	Charlie Peart	This is not an ordinary film. The star is a dwarf whose life has revolved around his love for trains. He inherits an abandoned train station, hence the name of the film. His co-stars are as quirky as he is and it makes for a fun and interesting film, not your typical fare from Hollywood. The director and screen writer did an excellent job with the characters keeping the viewer wondering where  this is going. There are several obvious flaws too. For example, one character is a hot dog vendor whose truck is kept at the abandoned station. Why there? Who knows. There are no customers except for the other co-star and a couple of losers who stop by once. Yet the man seems to have plenty of money, can't figure out how he really makes a living, but who cares, the film is fun anyway.	4.0	Quirky but fun	2014-03-27	0	0	0

I have always been a fan of great, outstanding performances, and Peter Dinkage as 'Fin' in the lead role is simply amazing. Not once is his character being exploited or exaggerated, rather, this film tells his story in an honest and heartfelt manner and he truly gives a remarkable performance....hitting a direct bullseye. The setting of this film is also unique, and will leave an impression in the viewer's mind forever.The rest of the cast are good, sometimes very good, and provide very sturdy support, but this is a film to see due to Dinkage in an impressive role, and the actual story it tells.This is one of those gentle and quiet films that have more of an impact than 3 action movies combined.See it soon !	4.0	A film to see at least once !	2005-09-27	5	5	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2XNOB1T796Y6B	"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!"""	"I finally decided to watch this film after having watched the first 5-10 minutes of it repeatedly on cable. I never got a chance to finish the film, having always been called away or on the go somewhere. I just naturally assumed that this was going to be some dark & overly depressing art flick that I'd regret watching. I was completely wrong.The film follows the character of Fin, a man with dwarfism who prefers to spend most of his time alone. He inherits a train depot in the middle of nowhere from his deceased boss, assuming that nobody will bother him & that he'll be able to enjoy his trains in peace. Once he gets there he discovers that a well-meaning snack truck operator parks his truck outside the train depot & is intent on befriending Fin. Fin also meets the clumsy artist Olivia, who is depressed over the loss of her son years before.I just loved this movie. There's so much to look at in this film & there's so many different ways people could interpret actions made by it's characters. I just really can't say enough good things about this film. Both my mother & I were skeptical that we'd like it, but by the end of the film both of us were saying that we wanted to buy the DVD.If you like action flicks or are looking for something with tons of romance, sex or intrigue, this isn't the film for you. This is very much a slice of life movie. There's no big message in the film, nor is there any touchy feely ""the more you know"". Finbar doesn't teach the town how to appreciate people with dwarfism, nor is there any point in the film where he has this big triumph over adversity. It's just a film about a group of people befriending each other.I freaking love this movie. And now apparently, I freaking love Peter Dinklage."	5.0	I adore this movie!	2009-10-04	3	3	0

She just has a way about here that just draws you into her character and into the story.This is a character based story and is character driven more then plot driven.My only pet peeve with this movie and a lot of independent films like it is that there is no close to the movie.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A36UOQOMFUTPH	Christopher B. Kornman	"Arriving under the dwarfing shadow of the big-budget epics like Matrix: Revolutions, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, sometimes there comes a film that is so refreshingly short, sweet, and simple that it has the power to, well, move you.And yes, I use the word ""dwarf"" deliberately.  He's not a midget.I'll confess, when I saw that the main character in this independent film was of hobbit-like proportions, I feared for the soul of the movie-making world.  I expected Wizard of Oz comical, or Lord of the Rings fantasy.  Or, and I prayed fervently this wouldn't happen, a sermon.  But instead what I got was a miniature enlightenment and some very fine low-budget entertainment.Sweeping the big three at the Sundance Film Festival (Best Film, Best Director, Best Performance) The Station Agent is set in a rural New Jersey town and involves the lives of three desperately different people finding out what it means to interact with each other.  It's touching, painful, hilarious, and most of all, it's real.  The film is soaked from start to finish with the kind of rich characterization you might expect from a P.T. Anderson picture.  Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a dwarf who, moving to a new community after inheriting property from a deceased friend, deals with the aloneness and self-pity that comes with being a small man in a big world.  Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) is his hot-dog selling, fast-talking, inhibition-free neighbor whose personality is so overbearingly friendly he can't make friends.  And Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson) is a divorced painter struggling with depression rooted in her child's death.Writer-Director Thomas McCarthy explores themes of loneliness, friendship, and all the humor and tragedy that come between with such honesty that you frequently find yourself laughing and crying in the very same instant.  It doesn't sugarcoat the pain of relationships, it doesn't make the every-day moments melodramatic, and it doesn't preach... too much.This isn't the film for the part of you that wants an ending with an overwhelmingly passionate romance, a sweeping death scene, or a sense of resolution.  The characters are much the same as when the film started, and though their problems are not fully solved, they are in the process of discovering people outside of themselves."	5.0	Refreshingly Minimalist	2004-09-30	5	3	2

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2BRVLLGGLX08G	Cookie Crook	Directed by Tom McCarthy, The Station Agent stars Peter Dinklage as Fin, a dwarf that moves to New Jersey after his boss dies of what we presume is a heart attack. Dinklage is joined by Joe (Bobby Cannavale) the hot dog and coffee vendor and artist Olivia (Patricia Clarkson). It is in Newfoundland, NJ that Fin inherits an abandoned train depot and begins to build relations with the quirkie town people. If you watch close you can catch Michelle Williamns (from tv--Dawson's Creek) as the librarian.The Station Agent is subtle writing and dialogue that flows smoothly from the well polished actors. Dinklage is impressive in this role as his brooding face coveys the pain and alienation he feels from his height and how people treat him. Clarkson is wonderful as usual with a stunning portrayal of a mother who has a deep loss and is unable to move on with her life; while Cannavale conveys his own lonliness and worry over the health of his sick father. The script and director move all characters into emotional development and you can see how each grows and comes to grips with his or her own pain. The Station Agent definately moves at a slower pace but this is necessary to facilitate the emotional connections that must be made between individuals, which is especially true for Fin who finds himself so isolated. The movie also highlights the fscination with trains and will be an interest to many train collectors out there. A movie worth renting and watching with friends, the Station Agent is a train trip you will want to take again and again.	4.0	All Aboard	2005-06-07	5	4	1

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A33YMRPUHIAU1K	Daeman Connolly	My gf turned me on to this indie gem from 2003 recently so i'm writing this review to hopefully pay that gift forward!  Peter Dinklage is engaging in his performance of Fin, a man stinging from an apparent lifetime of teasing and bullying, although the majority of his responses amount to monosyllabic utterances.  On the other hand, Bobby Cannavale's character, Joe, is a motormouth Puerto Rican who requires the constant companionship of Fin to take his mind off his ailing father.  The two meet and befriend Clarkson's character who carries some deep pain of her own.  Some of the most beautiful moments of the film occur as the three friends try to balance passions and pain with the desire to connect with other people, although not everyone moves at the same pace...Give this film a shot.  It's well worth the few bucks.	5.0	A Tasty Slice of Life	2013-11-01	2	1	1

Finally got to watch it the other night, and I must say it was well worth the wait. Peter Dinklage works wonders with just his face. When he's on the screen you can't take your eyes off him. There's never a false note in his performance. And the same can be said of his co-stars, Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale (where did this guy come from?). I just wanted to hang out with these three characters... which is really all you can ask from a movie. I also watched &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; the same weekend, and I want to say that with respective running times of 88-minutes and 155-minutes, &quot;... Agent&quot; delivers much more entertainment value!	4.0	Short But Sweet	2004-08-02	3	3	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	At the beginning of this film, Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage), a young dwarf, has eked out a place for himself in the world where he can have a little human contact, indulge his love of trains, and try to ignore the routine, unthinking cruelties that insensitive people subject him to everyday.  Finbar inherits an abandoned train depot when his friend Henry, the owner of the model train store where Finbar works, dies.  He goes there to live away from people but ends up gradually befriending several inhabitants of the small community around his depot.  Writer-director Thomas McCarthy and Dinklage do a very good job of portraying Finbar's fear of making himself vulnerable to the kinds of rejection and insult he has endured in the past without resorting to sentimentality.  At times, I almost wished for a little more sentiment, but Finbar is far too dignified to give in to easy emotion.  This is a very quiet film about good people with big problems who learn that there's nothing better than a friend to share some time with to make one's burdens seem lighter.  Cast members Bobby Cannavale, Patricia Clarkson, Raven Goodwin, and Michelle Williams are excellent as well./	4.0	Fine drama of human connections	2005-04-24	4	4	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A103KNDW8GN92L	David Hugaert	"All of the above adjectives perfectly describe ""The Station Agent"" to a tee. When Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) inherits an abandoned, run-down train depot, he inherits the lives of two ""socially challenged"" individuals as well. Joe (Bobby Canavale) runs his ailing dad's hot dog ""emporium"", Gorgeous Frank's, and Olivia, a recently divorced, forty-something writer (Patricia Clarkson), somehow take an interest in their newfound friend, and the three wind up taking an interesting journey together. On this journey, they learn about the social pitfalls of love and romance, and the price each has to pay for their own shortcomings. ""The Station Agent"" does well in utilizing its main theme in acting as a magnet in drawing its audience closer together, therefore tying any probable ""loose ends"" (to which there are few) together, looming large in the attention-getting factor. In totality, this is a motion picture that blends uplifting theatrics and climactic dramatics together quite flawlessly, and will definitely leave a positively lingering effect on its audiences. Go underground, and discover this hidden treasure (at your local theater or on video) soon. You'll positively, absolutely like what you see (and hear)!"	4.0	A Wholesome, Satisfying, Positively Lingering Drama	2003-12-27	6	4	2

A joyous, somewhat haunting work that exhibits the best aspects of contemporary and classic French cinema (no, I really mean it...), this film is a true masterpiece on every level - the performances, the casting, the lighting and sound, the script, the direction - I can't praise it highly enough. If there was an Academy Award for ensemble acting these folks deserve one. Low keyed, unforced, this is what acting and directing is about, these people know their craft. It moved me deeply and it's stayed with me for days. Miss it and you'll miss something very, very unique.

It does depend on the genre, but this movie has delivered a slice of human nature that is worth savoring. We thoroughly enjoyed it, admit that at first it was a bit sluggish - but the pace works in the long run.Characters are indeed characters and I really appreciated the entire movie. Not a dud in the bunch - hope to see more of the star, he's darn good and not at all hard on the eyes.  It just was a movie that made me feel - think - laugh - and yes, a few tears rolled. This ensemble was so well layered and quirky - people are quirky and if they deny it, run.Differences are necessary to make this world turn and until we all learn to coexist with some sort of acceptance of each other, the whole ball is going to fall flat.Enjoy - we sure did.	5.0	Well done slice of human nature	2014-03-28	0	0	0

This is a movie you SHOULD NOT MISS!Bobby Cannavale, Patricia Clarkson, and (especially) Peter Dinklage all give truly powerful performances; they take Joe McCarthy's natural dialogue and bring it to life in a refreshing and poignant way.Track it down and rent it if you are skeptical, and I'll admit, it may not be a movie that appeals to everyone; but you owe it to yourself to at least give it a shot.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A9VD20X239FSR	"Dean Backus ""Hi! How are you today?"""	Peter Dinklage may be the one of the most unlikely sex symbols ever to assay the role of A Stranger Comes To Town, but that's part of what makes this charming character study so offbeat and unforgettable.  As Finn, a dwarf who has just inherited an abandoned train station in Newfoundland, NJ, Dinklage carries the story on his small but exceptionally sturdy back, never begging the audience's sympathy but conveying worlds of anger, hurt, bewilderment and amusement in his dark eyes.  (His rumbly, seductive voice doesn't hurt either.)  As a local resident with a tragic past, Patricia Clarkson adds to her litany of complex women characters (and provides some of the film's biggest laughs when behind the wheel of her SUV), with stellar support from a garrulous Bobby Cannavale and a luminous Michelle Williams.  Settle into the film's gracious, generous rhythms and prepare to feel absolutely great.	5.0	Just plain wonderful character study	2006-08-02	5	5	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	ACU41EWUV4Z11	"Dennis Dix ""Morgan"""	This was a very sweet movie. I recommend this if you like a slow and deliberate character development arc. Not a lot happens and it starts very slow, but the slow and steady increase in complexity with Finn meeting his new neighbors and then developing relationships with them is satisfying and uncrowded. The relaxed pace gives your mind space to appreciate Finn's perspective - slow, simple, deliberate, full of heart, disenfranchised, dignified if not a bit aloof. It helps you break through your own discriminations to see the world through Finn's discerning eyes. It's almost as if the slow development of the plot line gives you time to appreciate the nuances of the &#34;right of way&#34; which is really a good metaphor for the inherent human dignity which Finn fights for throughout.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A69S4N1C80HFG	Dennis Keller	The story moves forward with little in the way of dialogue to help grasp the story.  Flynn's loneliness is evident from the very first scene.  His life is routine, comfortable, predictable and yet vaguely empty.  The inheritance of a half acre with a caboose, a passenger train car and a train station look more like a refuge from the loss of his work companion-friend than a move in his life.  His being a dwarf is not a big issue except when confronted by ignorance and macho immaturity.  The inanity and pain of living is clear from his two new found companions.  But it goes nowhere. There is no resolution, just more clarity as to their pain. They are left rocking on a porch overlooking a lake, each in their own isolation.  Looks like a contemporary version of  No Exit.	1.0	Great story idea that leads to no redemption or salvation - just a continued life that surrenders to what is with no future!	2014-03-18	4	1	3

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1LACH6MLQWZ	Doug Erlandson	Finnbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a dwarf who is willed an abandoned railroad station in tiny Newfoundland, New Jersey by his late boss. Having endured countless taunts because of his stature, Finn wants nothing more than to live out his life as a hermit in this isolated location in the hills of rural northern New Jersey, where he can indulge his passion for trains. However, such is not to be. He has barely arrived when he encounters Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), a recently-separated woman who is still grieving over the son she lost a couple years earlier and who, as an artist, has immersed herself in her painting to cover up the hurt. Although Finn tries hard to stay by himself, Olivia doesn't let this happen. Neither does Joe (Bobby Cannavale), the hot-dog vendor who sets up shop every day just outside the station. Little by little, these three, despite their different interests, become entwined with each other. Through this, each of these three people grow in self-awareness and character. This is definitely a movie worth watching.	5.0	Three misfits find friendship unexpectedly	2014-03-22	1	1	0

At times it's a very good look at what brings people together and what splits them apart, at others a run-of-the-mill ensemble movie with three very different leading parts. It takes a turn for the serious in the final act that kind of sours the mojo it had working earlier on, then coasts to a nondescript anti-ending that just felt like a black screen dropped into the middle of a generic scene.	3.0	Has its Moments	2011-02-18	3	0	3

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"Writer/director Tom McCarthy has made a most unique character study in 2003's ""The Station Agent"". It's a very quiet, episodic film, only 88 minutes long, but surprisingly assured and often compelling for a first-time filmmaker. It all centers on a dwarf named Fin, who seems rather indifferent about his life, especially after his boss dies and leaves him a train station in the outer reaches of New Jersey. Not so coincidentally, his passion is trains, and he just wants to be left alone to ""walk the right of way"" on the tracks. Of course, he keeps meeting up with people who are drawn to him. The two most prominent are Joe, a boisterous Cuban-American from Manhattan taking care of his ailing father's hot dog stand, and Olivia, a manic-depressive artist caught between her anguish over her son's death and her anger over her separation. There's also a shy little girl named Cleo and a young, friendly librarian, Emily. All of them look beyond Fin's diminutive stature and initial poker-faced demeanor to find him someone worthwhile to know. Consequently the movie feels more like a fable than a realistic portrait of discrimination and isolation. But the approach makes sense since we come to care about Fin's situation in spite of the fanciful fact that he doesn't seem to have any financial worries.It all sounds like the makings of a life-affirming TV-movie, but the methodical pacing and superlative acting transcend the more predictable aspects of the script. Peter Dinklage captures all the emotions that seep out of Fin after a lifetime of relative solitude and pained ridicule. Initially, you wonder why everyone wants to be his friend given his outward surliness, but he conveys the soulfulness that makes this particular plot contrivance believable. TV staple Bobby Cannavale makes Joe so likable with his high energy that you overlook his character's otherwise annoying neediness, and Patricia Clarkson gives her typically stellar performance as Olivia, her barbed intelligence intact, even as her character seems to descend into what appears to be an irretrievably depressive state. The seemingly effortless bonding that occurs among this trio provides the film's chief pleasure. On the sidelines, there are nice, affecting turns by a better-than-expected Michelle Williams as Emily and Raven Goodwin as Cleo. Unfortunately there are also some melodramatic flourishes, such as Fin's drunken assertion at the bar, his hurtful rejection by Olivia and the appearance of Emily's white-trash boyfriend, that don't seem to serve much purpose beyond confirming the fact that Fin needs love and friends. But these scenes don't detract from the obvious affection which McCarthy has for his characters, especially Fin.For a film made on the cheap (less than $500K in twenty days), it has a surprising cinematic feel with all the well-composed train shots, credit going to Oliver Bokelberg's expert camerawork. The DVD package has a nice audio commentary track by McCarthy and his three main actors with Cannavale providing particularly amusing anecdotes. There are five deleted scenes, three that provide more context to the relationship between Fin and his boss and the last one is I believe an alternate ending with the appearance of Joe's much-talked about father. Well worth viewing."	4.0	Affecting Fable of Fin and His Newly Found Friends	2005-05-05	4	4	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A34GZPHWYPSY2T	"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry"""	"THE STATION AGENT (2003, 88 minutes) stars New Jersey-born character actor Peter Dinklage as Finbar ""Fin"" McBride, a young man with dwarfism who is also somewhat shy, slightly antisocial and a train fanatic. (Thanks to the intrepid reader who caught my ""mistake"".)When Fin, a New Englander living in ""countryside"" New York, moves into the local abandoned old train station, he encounters two colorful local eccentrics who draw him out after befriending him. Readers will forgive me if I'm not sure where this takes place: I know from the film it seems to be right where New York and New Jersey countryside meet.It seems to me this film introduced Dinklage to America at least--people always fall for his large, soulful eyes and handsome visage. However, Dinklage is a powerful actor when he's allowed to be--here, since he's supposed to be an American he does a lovely, precise American accent without the lightest hint of New York or New Jersey in it. His performance here is really a tour de force.My wife and I saw this film and even though she was a bit lost as to its purpose, I saw right away that it is a film about the life of a 'small person'. I've never seen a movie dealing with the subject and never knew there was a drama like this, really showing the audience rather than lecturing us. When Fin first occupies the station as his home, there's a knock at the door.Dinklage's expression broke my heart: it is of sheer terror, not just a xenophobic reaction but the idea that he's small, people have seen him already and what if that's trouble at the door?--my heart broke because it suddenly occurred to me that life must be like that for small people. It also struck me that small people show incredible bravery just getting on with life. No wonder several famous small people have committed suicide.I wish to note that in my family, in our language, there is only one term for a small person which comes from the Latin. The word literally means ""a small person""--I say this because I'm actually unsure what the correct term is and I wonder why we ought to use any ""term"" at all. Medically if it concerns dwarfism, the individual is called a ""dwarf"". That seems too cruel, but I can't tell why.In the film, a cute little local girl befriends Fin, and asks him if he is a midget. He smiles and says simply, ""No."" A midget, again medically speaking, does not have dwarfism. Later in the film as he is speaking to one of his friends, he says he hated himself for being a dwarf. If you pay attention, Fin himself will explain to you what a ""station agent"" is (or was in the past anyway).This film is slow-paced, lightly humorous and it is no pity party by any means. I think everyone deserved Oscars here. It teaches the audience a lesson that everyone needs. As an original lifelong fan of Billy Barty, and with so many small people living in my area, I only bonded with the character of Fin at first. His dwarfism had to shocking impact on me anymore than the presence of a tall vase of flowers. After all, the tracks are a block away from my home where I grew up and still live--and as I said, many small people choose to live here, or else we have more dwarfism than other places.I love trains as much as Fin, but I don't know a fraction of the things he knows. So the film was something of a pleasant educational shock, because we see in it how the world definitely pretends there are no small people. Many things began whipping at me like the winter wind: how do they cope with public restrooms? Restaurants? Bars? Mailboxes? The world does not seem to hate small people--only it is horribly indifferent to their needs.Co-starring a then-fresh-faced Bobby Cannavale as Fin's goofy Puerto Rican friend and Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, Fin's other friend who has terrible demons of her own. The writer-director is Tom McCarthy, a not-so-well known but very employed actor who has done everything from bit parts on TV to larger parts in big films. His other major credit as director isThe Visitor. He has one other credit as director which I forget.This belongs in a collection, any film lover's collection. Why it has an R-rating is beyond me: it is undeserved and stupid. Often, I get the feeling the R is only meant to show audiences that it isn't a chidlren's film. There is nothing wrong with a well-made children's film!Miramax got the rights to release this but I see other releases here besides their expensive release. This is clearly an indie film, and it appears to have been made with European audiences in mind.Watch this and learn!"	5.0	First one I've ever seen that deals with dwarfism	2013-10-20	3	1	2

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2Z2URBU123J7N	E. J. Hokanson	I saw this great film the other day.  A complex film that works on so many different levels.  Its about loss and redemption.  Its about a dwarf named Fin who undergoes a personal transformation from a angry, bitter, withdrawn, hard, cold man at the beginning into a warm and caring gentleman by the end.  With the help of four well-drawn characters that befriend Fin.  There's Joe (an outgoing chatterbox who operates a coffee stand/truck).  Then there's Olivia (a painter and a mother who had lost her son and separated from her husband).  There's also Cleo (a little black girl who shares an interest in trains).  Also there's Emily (young, naive librarian with an abusive redneck boyfriend).  These characters, in effect, reveal Fin to be something entirely different from what we initially see.  They chip and chisel, and peel back Fin's cold, hard exterior shell to show Fin's real, true character.  The true character that would have been had he not endured such a tough, painful life as a dwarf.  Ironically, Fin makes more friends in this remote, rural town than he ever did living in the big city.  The loneliness of the big city.  This is a deep film with a lot of powerful things to say and lessons to be learned if you look closely.  Now I know why this was a Sundance darling.

Not to imply quality, or lack of quality&#8230; just throwing out a &#8216;heads up&#8217; to those who have a preference one way or the other.That being said, if the phrase &#8216;independent film&#8217; does not bring to mind any preconceptions for you, then I highly recommend giving this film a try. I *really* want to hold back from an actual review here, as I feel that this is one of those films that needs to be seen before being too polluted by opinions of others, but I&#8217;ll go ahead and lay out a few ambiguous personal views anyway:  it&#8217;s entertaining, paced well and has about the best casting I could imagine for the story being told&#8230; even though the story at its core isn&#8217;t anything all that original (but jaded happens for anyone who watches too many movies, I suppose).The only caveat emptor I feel should be mentioned is that (as the tile implies&#8230; or, might come to imply in a few more words) while not specifically a &#8216;railroad&#8217; film, trains do play a role more akin to character than backdrop.

Because the portrayal of the characters is realistic without looking like something you see everyday. If you wanted everyday, all you'd have to do is keep doing what you're doing or go to the Wal-mart, or to church, or to your job.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AXFI7TAWD6H6X	Erica Anderson	"I just came back from seeing ""The Station Agent"". I thought it was a wonderful film. After seeing ""Mystic River"" last month, ""The Station Agent"" is a wonderful antidote to the heavy drama of the Dennis Lehane novel. Peter Dinklage as Finn is worthy of an Oscar nod. It was so refreshing to see a dwarf be portrayed as a human being as opposed to a cartoonish stereotype. Here the viewer sees a man who is only 4 feet, 5 inches tall isolate himself emotionally from society because all his life he had been teased and taunted by people. Finn is forced to interact with his new neighbors in Newfoundland, NJ. Bobby Cannavale as the annoyingly nosy hot dog/coffee vendor Joe and Patricia Clarkson as the grieving Olivia Harris also gave excellent, if not convincing peformances in the film. Joe reminded me how annoying I used to be as a teenager by following other people around. As annoying and nosy Joe was, he had a good heart. He wasn't as obnoxious as tv's Steve Urkel. Patricia Clarkson was wonderful as Olivia Harris. I really enjoyed the scenes when she first encountered Finn in the beginning of the film. Those were hilarious. One of my favorite scenes in the film was when Finn was in the bar getting drunk. I loved how the cinematography was shot from Finn's drunken perspective. Although her presence in the film was albeit brief, former Dawson's Creek star Michelle Williams also performed well. I always did think that she was the talented actor of all the Dawson's Creek cast. Her character's interaction with Finn was sweet. Without giving out anything, I didn't expect for the film to end the way that it did. Not that it is a bad thing, I was just surprised. Some people might be put off by that but I liked being surprised and it pretty much wrapped things up within 90 minutes. ""The Station Agent"" is a character-driven movie. I really enjoy movies like ""The Station Agent"" than the garbage that is currently being churned out at the moment by Hollywood. Human drama makes for a more interesting movie than all the special effects in Hollywood. ""The Station Agent"" is definitely another favorite film of mine I have seen this year."	5.0	A wonderful film	2003-11-22	2	2	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AGUIM8YMYM49Z	Eric Olsen	The biggest surprise in all the films of 2003 came in quite a small package.  This movie stars Peter Dinklage as a dwarf named Finn, who inherits an abandoned train depot in a small New Jersey town where he befriends/acquaints two other locals, Joe and Olivia.  Joe, played by Bobby Canavale is the comic relief character of the year in the way that he lazily maintains his hot dog and coffee stand outside of the depot while constantly trying to befriend Finn.  Finn, however, through years of being self-conscious of his appearance wants nothing more than to be left alone.  The film provides a wonderful portrayal of loners, and how they never are truly just that.  The film also contains one of the most abrupt endings of the year, and as a sucker for wanting all the pieces tied up, was unsatisfying.  But, that could not stop the wonder that this movie is, and it is a film that I would recommend to anyone.	5.0	Who wants to say grace?	2004-11-11	2	2	0

A trio of eccentric people in a small town become reluctant friends and share ups and downs together, drawing each other out of their respective shells, depressions and introversions. Peter Dinklage plays Finnbar McBride, a dwarf who has a passion for trains and inherits an abandoned train depot, where he intends to live in solitude, that is until well meaning neighbors and townsfolk (Bobby Cannavale as Joe the hot dog vendor and Patricia Clarkson as local artist Olivia) insist on including Finn in their activities. What evolves is a deep and meaningful friendship among the three, and though there are difficulties and rough spots, they persevere.

Fin, finding it hard to deal with ordinary life because, he's less than ordinary(looking), decides to give up on society and seeks out a quiet life for himself in his newly inherited abandoned train station. Due to his ""freakish"" appearence he has developed a hard outer shell and simply wants to be left alone. However, because of circumstance and proximity he is befriended by two locals equally as lonely. As the companionship slowly developes each character becomes more and more real. The acting in this flim is as effortless as it comes. Between the dialog, acting and directing this film goes down as one of the best movies I've seen this year. It leaves the viewer with the the obvious question, why are we so put-off by appearenece and people who are different and why can't we get passed it? I spoke with a guy after the movie let out about the film. He told me it was unrealistic that two ""normal"" characters would go out of their way to befriend a dwarf. I found that odd and shallow but, perhaps honest. Maybe these ""unusual"" people are just as ordinary and boring as the rest of us!"	4.0	As real a reel as they come.	2003-12-18	7	6	1

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1X12F0KC8GY6M	FLbeachbum	"""The Station Agent"" is yet another film that I was curious about partly because of its New Jersey locale. Early on in the story we move from Hoboken to the more rural Newfoundland (pronounced NewFOUNDland), when the main character (Fin) inherits the train depot where he plans to live in solitude. Alas, it is not meant to be, as he can't avoid running into others, or rather, as is the case with Olivia, they can't seem to avoid running into him, (almost) literally. There is also Joe, who parks his Dad's mobile hot dog/coffee stand near the depot every day, despite it being a less than ideal place to draw customers, since trains no longer stop here. Nevertheless Fin as ""The Station Agent"", might have known that he would encounter others with varying degrees of baggage. He carries his own baggage too, as he is a man of quiet dignity who is tired of his stature as a dwarf making him an easy target for ridicule. Then there is the young local librarian, with her share of issues as well, in addition to a grammar school student who would like Fin to speak to her class about trains.While at first it appears that these characters have nothing in common, it soon becomes clear that in addition to their own individual demons and travails, they are all genuine and basically good-natured. The movie's conclusion has a sort of ""we may as well chill out and make the best of it"" feel to it, which is sufficiently satisfactory.Not being much of a TV viewer, I'm not familiar with any of these actors, but I think they all do a fine job. If you enjoy character-driven (as opposed to plot-driven) pieces, I can easily recommend ""The Station Agent""."	4.0	A New Look at New Jersey	2005-06-18	6	6	0

The three protagonists form an unusual friendship and find that as they discover more about each other, they find out more about themselves.  Peter Dinklage (Death at the Funeral) plays the taciturn title character who, once willed an abandoned train station, decides to live there as a hermit.  His physical difference (he's a dwarf) sets him apart from his neighbors and has probably been an issue all of his life.

With great dignity and courage, Finbar walks the right-of-way of our social biases and preconceptions and offers a self-contained, yet strong jaw, to anyone that might doubt his relevance as a whole and feeling human beingBut Dinklage is only one third of the dynamic and capable triumverate of actors who together, weld this movie into a seamless and memorable, ensemble production.Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale both join Mr. Dinklage in wonderful performances, portraying Olivia Harris and Joe Oramas, both of whom, like Finbar, walk the rails of their own personal social integration and acceptance problems.In the end, this movie takes us on a fully enjoyable ride that exposes us to a broad and realistic landscape of human emotions and interactions and teaches us what the ingredients of true friendship are."	5.0	A Perfect Friendship	2014-04-10	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1UVD8NIGUGAY4	G. Hernandez	This is about the 4th time I have seen this movie and I am not exactly sure why I like it so much. It could be the very strong acting, and also knowing the back story about how the van, the house, the paintings were borrowed, and how a school was converted to look like a waiting room of a hospital. In other words it is one of those great films on a tight budget that was obviously a labor of love for everyone involved. I told one of my friend to watch it, and to this day she cannot understand the appeal it has for me. I explained it has no deep and profound meaning other than maybe that no man is an island.  Watch this one, it will make you sad one minute, and have you in stitches the next.	4.0	Wonderful little movie	2014-03-19	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A17IW44FV0HUTY	Glen Engel Cox	We've had this movie for the last month, always putting off watching it for one reason or another. It is a very understated movie, with much of the action never commented on directly in the movie, but left up for the viewer to figure out. The plot is simple: Finbar McBride is a dwarf who loses his job when his best friend and boss suddenly dies, leaving him with a train depot in his will. Moving out to the small town where the depot is, all he wants to do is be left alone, but a combination of the Joe, the local Cuban hot dog vendor, and Olivia, a frazzled young mother who is grieving for the loss of her son, forces him to confront his new community, just as they are forced to confront him. Much of the humor comes from Joe, who forces himself into Fin's life, as well as the attempts by Olivia to try to make up for her first impression on Fin.What's best about this movie is that it gives the actor who plays Fin the ability to show the viewer what it must feel like to be a dwarf, the constant stares and rude comments. But his portrayal isn't meant to invoke sympathy so much as understanding, an understanding that he's come to accept that as his fate, just as much as anyone with any sensitivity should decry it.There's not a conclusion, per se, but there is a resolution, one that affirms the lives of the characters in the story inasmuch as you can see that they learned something from each other. It's like a small version (no pun intended) of The Breakfast Club or The Big Chill, and I'd recommend it.	5.0	Wonderfully underplayed and life affirming	2006-11-05	3	3	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A14JANATCMRLDX	Goobie Doober	"Okay, first off, I am most definitely a fan of alpha-male, high testosterone films -- love Horror, slasher, action, kung fu films.  Horror, especially, is the genre in which I will watch almost anything.  Have seen the ""Alien"" series countless times and worship ""The Walking Dead.""  So, for me to watch an Indie film which is entirely dialogue and character building, that is a rarity.The first time I saw ""The Station Agent,"" shockingly and surprisingly, I liked it.  A lot.By the end of the 2nd time I watched, it was literally in my top 10 films of all time.The story is sweet, the dialogue, although slow -- it's meant to be slow -- is funny, and the characters absolutely adorable.  All three of them.What is truly special about this film is how they each are going through their sh*t in their lives, and yet their mutual friendships are both comforting and real.So, if this action film, zombie-loving movie freak and actually love this movie, then it is soooooooo highly recommended."	5.0	10 stars out of 5!	2012-10-13	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1NT3HJYYHYCA5	Govindan Nair	"Several lonely characters in a small non descript New Jersey town do not make for a major Hollywood drama. But this ""small movie"" is very human and manages to sustain your involvement without the usual gratuitous doses of fight or flesh. Finnbar, the main character, is a midget who inherits a disused smalltown train station when his boss dies. He converts this to his new home next to the tracks where trains no longer stop. Initially trying to shun contact with others, his life becomes slowly woven with other characters in this little New Jersey town of Newfoundland. There is Joe, the hot dog/coffee stand vendor, who continually receives calls from his ill father; Olivia, the artist haunted by the accidental death of her young son, which has estranged her from the husband from whom she has now seperated; a pretty young local town librarian who admires the midget's striking facial features; and a young black schoogirl who keeps popping in and out from seemingly nowhere, seeking to get Finnbar to overcome his reluctance to make a presentation on trains to her grade school class. What binds Finnbarr to Joe and Olivia is their common sense of intense loneliness, for which the abandoned silent tracks provide an unmistkable metaphor. Several superbly shot scenes and some wonderful dialogue are what keeps you hooked throughout this movie in addition to some very fine acting. You almost begin feeling after a while that you are next to the same railway tracks or in the same living room as the three main characters. I only wished, when it was over, that this type of movie were more the norm. Please see this movie!"	5.0	Not a shlocky Hollywood drama - see this movie!	2003-10-18	19	18	1
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	THE STATION AGENT is a miniature masterpiece.  Director Tom McCarthy has achieved on a small budget, rapid sequence filming, and no frills media use, a film that proves that this art form is alive and well right here in the US.  The story is simple but cogent:  Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a dwarf who has been working as a model train maker for an African American store owner Henry Styles (Paul Benjamin), one of the few people that treats him without prejudice. Their relationship is gentle but supportive. Henry literally drops dead and Fin discovers he is the sole heir in Henry's will: Fin now owns a dilapidated train depot in Newfoundland, NJ.  Having nowhere else to go, Fin moves into his new home, seeking solitude from the world of ignorantly derisive people.  But parked in front of his space is a Hot Dog and Coffee wagon operated  by garrulous Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a warmly friendly guy who wants to hangout with Fin.  Fin also encounters the slightly flighty artist Olivia (Patricia Clarkson) who after two 'accidental encounters' on the highway seeks out Fin also.  In his attempt to foster anonymity Fin avoids these new would-be friends, spends time at the local library reading about his passion - trains - and encounters the fragile librarian Emily (Michelle Williams) who also finds him strangely attractive.  Another &quot;invader&quot; into his space is a young African American girl Cleo (Raven Goodwin) who simply wants to understand Fin's life and plight.  The story is simply the communication that grows among these disparate people, each needy, each with occult compassion trying to surface.  This interaction is all there is to the 88-minute film, but in its brevity and spare dialogue we are drawn into the lives of these fragile folk to the point that saying goodbye to them at the end is heartrending.  What a cast!  Dinklage, Clarkson, Cannavale, and Williams are as fine as they come, creating as much character with body language and lingering looks than with verbiage.  An absolutely first rate film in every aspect.	5.0	A Simple and Simply Wonderful Film	2004-06-16	7	6	1

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3V3MULTMCYJSI	Greg67	I can't believe it's taken me ten years (the movie came out in 2003!!!) to see this movie! Peter Dinklage (recently of Game of Thrones fame) plays a solitary soul as a result of his dwarfism...he keeps to himself and goes to his secluded job each day with predictable results. He's in control of his existence. He &#34;ignores&#34; the jibes he gets from strangers because of his size, so when he inherits a plot of land from his deceased employer that is quite separated from most of humanity, he jumps at the chance to pursue his solitary existence.Friendships are unexpectedly thrust upon him, and the movie explores the ups and downs of caring, commitment, and self-worth...not only for Finn (Dinklage), but for his new-found friends.One of my new favorites.	5.0	Yes, you should watch this...	2014-04-05	0	0	0

Without spoiling much it can be said that the viewer gets a peek into an intimate story of a lonely man finding friendship in unusual circumstances.

The other two characters are a woman painter who's sort of lost as a result of a tragic accident, and a young man that sells coffee and sandwiches from lunch truck parked along side the defunct train station when he's not looking after his sickly father. The three meet and start to form a close friendship of support for each other.  ...Not sure why the movie is called a comedy; I didn't laugh once during the entire movie.	3.0	Hinterlands of New Jersey	2014-04-06	0	0	0

Check out her work in &quot;High Art,&quot; &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; and &quot;Pieces of April,&quot; and you'll understand.  &quot;The Station Agent&quot; is a wonderful, life affirming film about &quot;real&quot; people.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AYW9KYWIU75LI	Jackbooted thug	In an age of mindless entertainment for the masses this film stands out as an example of what can be done without special effects, huge budgets and big names. This is a film for a thinking person and it is one of the best examples of good character development I've ever seen. There are no car chases, gunfights, nudity or explosions; so if you need those things to be entertained, pick something else. If you enjoy a morality play that's deep but not dark, you may want to watch this one.The main character is very secure in who he is. Even though he is a loner in some sense, he interacts with those around him. At first those interactions are forced upon him but later he seeks out that human interaction from those will become his friends. His strength of character quietly and slowly lifts up those around him. In the process, his life becomes better. He's not the conductor, he's &#34;The Station Agent&#34;.	5.0	Real Characters -  Deep but not dark	2014-07-06	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3CCM6X4FN0JRO	"James Rodway ""Jamie"""	The worst part about this movie is that it ends and quite suddenly at that.  You want to know more.  You get to know the three characters so well that it's sad to not see how the rest of the story is going to go.  Of course it's also wonderful because you leave talking about these people as if they were friends.  No sequel is needed or wanted.Yes every once in a while Hollywood produces a movie that allows characters to be interesting not because of a car chase, a gun fight or a sex scene.  Instead the beauty of 'The Station Agent' is these three characters are interesting because they are real.  These people have flaws and yet these flaws are not overplayed.  These people are fun and know how to laugh.  They also have hard times too.  It's all part of their story and all part of life.This is a movie where dialogue - and sometimes communication without the limitations of words - carries the story and keeps our interest.

If you've been watching 'Game Of Thrones' then you are familiar with Dinklage's superb character acting as Tyrion Lannester, 'The Imp'. In the 'The Station Agent' Dinklage plays Finn, a somewhat withdrawn dwarf working in an model railroad shop while struggling with an insensitive world. After the shop owner drops from a heart attack Finn inherits an old abandoned railroad agent building in rural New Jersey. It is there that he meets colorful characters each with their own unique flaws. You learn that it is tough being a dwarf in a tall world.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1E1LEVQ9VQNK	J. Chambers	After seeing so many movies that rely heavily on CGI and massive amounts of ordnance and high explosives, sometimes it's really nice to just watch capable actors going about the business of acting. The Station Agent was such a film, with outstanding performances by Peter Dinklage as Fin, a dwarf who inherits an old abandoned railway station in a rural area of New Jersey; Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, a local woman who's mourning her dead son; and Bobby Cannavale as Joe, who's manning the family's food truck while his father recovers from a heart attack. There's also Michelle Williams in a fine supporting role as Emily, the town librarian.Fin just wants to be left alone, but Olivia keeps running into him (literally!), and Joe just wants some company while he runs the food truck. They make an odd trio, but after a rocky start they develop a friendship for each other, and Fin gradually comes out of his self-imposed withdrawal. It's a quirky little low budget film, but I enjoyed it as much as any of the blockbusters that I've seen in the past year. It's a compelling human interest story with some excellent acting and a great mix of both comedy and drama. And the last scene has some of the best lines I've heard in a movie. Talking about Emily the librarian, it goes like this:Joe: It's the librarian fantasy, man. Glasses off, hair down, books flying...Fin: She doesn't wear glasses.Olivia: Well, buy her some, it's worth it.It's a marvelously enjoyable film.	5.0	A marvelously enjoyable film	2014-05-26	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3O3818ZGGHR6O	J. Koch	"A slow-paced good story with the occasional chuckle and bits of poignant sadness.  What I liked most about this movie were how the different characters interact with Finn (Excellently played by Peter Dinklage). For example, parts where Olivia (Patricia Clarkson) and Emily (Michelle Williams) say things like ""you don't have to say anything, or we can eat quietly,"" help show their empathy with Finn's need for peace quiet.  That same empathy helps them see him as a person, and ask him about his interests and where he's from.  This contrasts with Joe's or the little girl's treatment of Finn. Overall, a very charming film with well-filmed scenery."	4.0	A good yarn	2004-10-30	3	3	0

Clarkson and Carnavale are delightful as Fin's new friends, yet the movie is unimaginable without Dinklage's touching turn as a defensive man whose passion for trains helps stanch the pain of having lost his truest friend. Funny and deceptively simple, ""Agent"" is the kind of smart, refreshingly understated indie I wish we'd see more of from the Sundance crowd."	5.0	The Station Agent	2007-07-30	3	3	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AH30KCS6NVPF3	"John J. Koons ""TheatreGrove"""	I think Hollywood is underestimating the American public by not utilizing the talents of Peter Dinklage. He has talent, good looks and a voice that seems to resonate in your torso.Yes, I loved this film and I loved everyone in it. It was a fortunate accident that I watched it as I had the misunderstanding that it was a British movie, which I would usually pick over an American movie. British films are usually a sure-thing for me whereas great American films are a little sparse.Patricia Clarkson: Never saw her on TV but have enjoyed her performance in every movie I've seen her in. You can read what's going on in her face when she is not speaking. You can turn down the volume while watching this movie and you would still understand everything that is going on.Bobby Cannavale: Everything, I've enjoyed everything I have ever seen him in. He's a feel-good actor, often reminding you of that great buddy you always enjoy being around. I haven't seen him in the two television shows listed in his credits but I can see him in a good Ephron-style romance. He has leading-man qualities I haven't seen utilized, yet.Every non-principal character was very natural and believable on screen. No one was &#34;acting.&#34;But, Mr. Dinklage ... I want to see him in leading roles on the screen and I would pay handsomely to catch him on stage. He has Shakespearian qualities and what you see in his eyes and hear in that resonant voice ... he's quality and should be handed quality scripts.All that said, you need to be in the right mood to view this film. It's slightly &#34;Baghdad-Cafe&#34;-artsy. It has that warm independent film feel. Those who have ever lived in small towns might appreciate the familiarity of the town's residents.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A33CLVW2K7SL1P	Jonathan Appleseed	"I'm really on the fence with this film. I know that it's very highly regarded by the film industry, and that it won a BAFTA award. Obviously, there are people ""in the know"" who think it's terrific. It's one of those ""nothing really happens"" movies, instead being a character piece with human emotion. The problem I have with it is that it doesn't really delve into its characters as much as I feel it should have, and the emotion that's displayed - with one notable exception - is extremely minimal.The story centers around a dwarf (Fin) who inherits half an acre of land, on which is a home and a train depot. Fin is a train enthusiast, and instead of moving into the home, he takes up residence in the train depot. That's a quiet, telling aspect of his personality, and I enjoyed that glimpse into what makes him tick. However, it was what followed that has me on the fence. Beyond that slight ""tell"", and his repeated insistence to be left alone even when some very kind people who accept him for exactly who he is are trying to befriend him, we don't learn very much about his character at all. He definitely grows as a character, and that's absolutely essential for a book or a movie, but the reasons for his growth are unclear: unless it was simply the slow breaking down of his walls by a congenial vendor (Joe) who runs a hot dog/coffee/maybe ice cream stand out of a small trailer right outside of the depot, and a woman (Olivia) who - in two absolutely hysterical moments that left me in stitches - nearly ran him off the road while paying no attention to her driving.Joe, Olivia, and Fin all become good friends - but I really didn't know why. The vendor seemed desperate for friends, and that was easy enough to understand. We met some of his so-called friends, and they were horrendous individuals who made fun of Fin. If I had been in that exact situation, I might have handled it by breaking their noses (although I doubt it). However, it did me that angry and I exclaimed that I *would* have broken their noses. Anyway, that's hardly material.Earlier in the film there were also some very sad and angering moments when kids, as well as adults, made fun of Fin either in whispers or directly out loud so that he could hear. Trying to put myself into the mind of a dwarf who has likely spent most of his life being mocked and made fun, it's a little more understandable as to why he wants to be left alone. However, before his friend died and he inherited the land, he did have a group of friends who were all train enthusiasts. So he wasn't completely cut off from the world.All of these characters are immensely likeable, and the actors put in excellent performances. But like I said, I'm on the fence. I can appreciate movies that tell you more about characters by what is unsaid as opposed to what is said, but I just felt that more should have been said - and I'm not talking monologues here, I just wanted to hear a little more about what Fin felt. There was a perfect opportunity to tell those of us who are ""tall"" exactly what it feels like to be a dwarf, and I felt that the film - while definitely showing us uncomfortable moments in his life - fell short on that. For example - when the group of kids made fun of him, how *exactly* did he feel? All we saw was a blank expression on his face, which did imply that he has learned to simply ignore these taunts, but I wanted more.Still, I did like the film, mostly because, as I said, the characters are very likeable and the performances were top notch.All of my reservations aside, I would still recommend this."	4.0	I found myself wanting a little more	2005-02-06	5	3	2

There were painfully human scenes, and joyful ones.  I can see where some might say it doesn't really resolve. But it does, in the best way it could have.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3GRN6J64F2C3X	Joseph P. Menta, Jr.	"Thomas McCarthy's 2003 drama, ""The Station Agent"", is a film decidedly not for everyone. A dwarf (played by Peter Dinklage, a real-life little person), inherits a train depot out in the boonies from his deceased boss (they had both worked in a small shop that sold and repaired model trains) and promptly moves into the depot to get away from all the stares and other nonsense people like him have to deal with on a daily basis.The rest of the movie is basically Fin (Fin McBride is the character's name) dealing with the fact that no one leaves him alone once he moves into the remote depot in the wilds of New Jersey... not the guy who runs the coffee truck (played by Bobby Cannivale), who inexplicably sets up every morning in the deserted area near Fin's new residence, or the somewhat distracted artist covered with paint spatters (Patricia Clarkson) who seemingly is the coffee truck's only customer. They're both fascinated with Fin, first because of his dwarfism but later because he demonstrates (despite his efforts to be left alone) that he's an interesting guy, and kind of nice to be around. Soon, they (and a couple of others) don't even notice he's a dwarf and just want to get a little of his attention. You see, they're all misfits, too, if not in an immediately recognizable way like Fin.Like I said, it's not a complicated, densely plotted movie, and many will likely cop a ""what's the point?"" attitude. But, if you can enjoy watching everybody becoming a little richer and perhaps happier from their new associations with each other (even Fin), this might be worth your time. In my view, ""The Station Agent"" is offbeat, funny, not too serious (though there are some serious moments), and overall a warm, resonant hour and a half or so. I liked it and you might, too."	4.0	Life blossoms among some lonely, broken people	2010-07-30	2	2	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2UGS8FNWY3AWU	"Kat Crane ""Web Kat"""	A well written independent film that explores the complexities of &#34;connecting&#34; in the world, in spite of the psychological pain and personal hardships that can hold one back. Bobby Canavale is charming as the gregarious, confident (and tall) foil to Peter Dinglage's brooding, introverted Finn. This story of &#34;unlikely friendships&#34; boasts detailed character development and subtle, nuanced perfomances by the stellar cast. The heavier subject matter is punctuated liberally with intelligent humor and even a few laugh-out-loud moments. The story stayed with me for many years after seeing the film in the theater - and is one I like to re-visit on DVD every few years. It is a &#34;must see&#34; for fans of independent films who desire intelligent dialogue and deep character development. If you want fast-paced action and explosions, this film is not for you.	5.0	Thoughtful & Insightful Independent Film	2014-04-12	0	0	0

It is absolutely flawless, and I truly cannot recommend this piece enough. I felt like I finally exhaled on the film's completion, so taken was I by the characters, scenery and sheer uniqueness.The characters are charming and beautifully flawed. Diverse and incredibly well acted. Within a mere 90 minutes, each unique character is fully fleshed and their beautiful little doubts, worries and quiet humanity is wonderfully examined. Its also a completely unique and very quirky little story.This is what movies should be about.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AF74UAKV3Q3W0	Kathy Parsons	"I love movies like this where the characters are off-beat but totally believable. The three main characters are all somewhat displaced, with Fin, the ""little person,"" inheriting a train station in the middle of nowhere; Olivia staying at a ""get-away"" home purchased by her husband before he ""got away"" and still grieving the sudden death of her young son; and Joe, the chatty hot-dog vendor who loves to talk and cook, who has returned to care for his ailing father and run his vending truck. These three characters apparently have little in common but a need to care and be cared for. Fin wants isolation, but the quirky characters in his midst won't allow that. He feels like a freak because of his size, but that goes away when he is spending time with his new friends. The tenuous bonds break, leaving the three characters with a terrible sense of loss that almost becomes tragic for two of them. Love truly triumphs in this film (not the romantic kind of love), and you know by the end that they will be okay. Beautifully written and acted, this film is a joy to behold. Highly recommended!"	5.0	Intensely Human...	2007-03-25	5	4	1

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	"MOVIE: This film is probably the best film I've ever seen. With movies these days it is so difficult to find a true film. A film not a movie. The Station Agent tells the story of a dwarf named Finn. He worked at a train model store and was close friends with the owner. When the owner dies he leaves Finn his old station house, and with no home or family this is where Finn lives. All his life Finn has to deal with the bitter remarks people make at him and the beating of society has left Finn isolated and alone. All he wants is to be left alone. While at his new found house in Newfoundland, New Jersey, catchy symbolism isn't it, he meets a hot dog stand guy named Joe and a middle aged woman named Olivia. They slowly become friends and share the fact that each of them are struggling with their lives in some aspect. Each of them discover that being with each other is a lot more rewarding than being isolated from the brutality of life. The movie is also filled with rich symbolism and each shot is framed with so much meaning. The town as mentioned before is called Newfoundland, New Jersey. Finn being a train enthusiast works out for the symbolism especially the scenes of him walking the train tracks. Trains have a structured path, only one way to go. Finn has limited himself to this ""one path"" way of life and with his new found friendships he starts to create his own path instead of letting society move him. This film is not only a comic gem but it is emotionally powerful. First time writer and director Tom McCarthy has proven himself to be a great filmmaker with his first film, a rarity now days. This small film has such a powerful effect on the audience that you will be thinking about it long after you see it. After I watched it on DVD I said the same thing to myself that I said after seeing it in the theater, ""man, what a great film"". People who limit themselves to movies like The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars have my pity because they will never know what they are missing. I guarantee that this movie will move you emotionally and will be an experience you will never forget.VIDEO: The DVD has a very decent picture, and in order to get the full effect of the vibrant shots and the train track scenes it is best to watch on a HD Widescreen tv. Even though the acting is what made the film, the cinematography was also exceptional.AUDIO: Basic 5.1 Audio mix that does the job. This is a character-based movie and really doesn't require a heavy based sound mix.PACKAGING / EXTRAS: The DVD comes in the standard Armaray case with no insert.  The only extras are deleted scenes and a commentary by McCarthy. Miramax has also thrown in a bunch of trailers for their other movies like Cold Mountain, City of God, The Barbarian Invasions, and some others.  Being a small movie that probably many average movie goers never heard of, it was expected to have a bare-bones release on DVD. I really feel bad that movies like this never get to see a wide release or a large amount of interest because these are the movies that film was invented for.MOVIE SCORE: (* * * * *). . . and then someDVD SCORE: (7 / 10)"	5.0	Not Only Genuine & True But Emotionally Moving	2004-06-20	5	5	0

So he moves to what he thinks will be an isolated location.  Only to find himself being run over (almost literally) by locals trying to befriend him.  The story examines the ebb and flow of friendship - how we let our guards down, and then put them back up, then let them down again.  And the steadfast presence of friends through these struggles.  The magic of the film is that it addresses these major themes while being laugh-out-loud funny.	5.0	Three Motley Characters and Many Laugh Out Loud Moments	2004-10-27	3	2	1

I caught a review given my Leonard Maltin (sp?) that directed me to this quirky film that I fell in love with...This movie may not hold the attention of movie-goers with short attention spans but if you have the time to get to know Finn and his new friends please settle back and do so!  This movie does not constantly expose you to how cruel people can be.  Instead, you see glimpses of the challenges faced by this character who decides to become a loner rather than risk being hurt or disappointed by others.  Many of the scene will even make you chuckle or laugh out loud.I particularly enjoyed the interactions Finn has with the child in the trainyard.  She asks him direct questions, he gives her direct answers.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3EJBNMM7J96UZ	Keith E.

Laying it out here, it doesn't seem to add up. And on the screen it doesn't seem to add up either, except it really does. That that makes for a strange little movie. Not the best I've ever seen, not even in the top 20. But way far from the worst. Strangely intriguing and attractive yet not 100% satisfying.	4.0	A strange little movie	2014-03-25	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2DXOD9HQBE1FL	"Kevin Rienecker ""Kev"""	Right off, this endearing indie about a train-watching dwarf (Peter Dinklage) who unexpectedly inherits an isolated train station in the boonies of New Jersey deserves every single award it won at Sundance and every morsel of praise I can heap on it.Peter Dinklage is a marvel in this, his first big lead role, as his character Fin McBride slowly comes to terms with life, death, loneliness, and the true meaning of friendship. Director Thomas McCarthy lets his story unfold in due time, and allows each actor live and breathe their characters. The supporting cast, led by Bobby Cannavale as the super-chatty hot-dog/coffee cart jockey Joe and Patricia Clarkson as the depressed artist Olivia, is absolutely top-notch.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	Station Agent is a small independent film with terrific performance by an excellent cast, which displays the promise of the new director Thomas McCarthy.  The story revolves around Fin (Peter Dinklage) who is constantly reminded in malicious ways of his short stature as he suffers from dwarfism.  When Fin's only friend and owner of the store in which he works dies he inherits a small rail road station, which is no longer in use.  The station is located in small town where time seems to stand still.  Fin seizes the opportunity and moves to the remote location as he seeks solitude from the constant staring and hounding.  However, as Fin arrives he is constantly followed by the talkative and good-willed Joe, the scatter-brained mourning Olivia, and the shy elementary school girl Cleo among others.  In the company of these people Fin shares his joy and interests as it opens up the pleasure of living for Fin.  The story offers much wonder for hope and promise as it deals with a delicate issue, which is portrayed with much class and style.  The simple mise-en-scene is merely brilliant as it only depicts what is needed to know, yet it enhances each scene as it offers more to think about.  In the end, Station Agent offers a great cinematic experience that is close and personal to anyone who views this film.	5.0	A close and personal cinematic experience...	2004-06-29	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2P922IN7UTEFT	"K. Kurtz ""Bull Terrier Owner"""	The Station Agent is one of my top ten favorite films.  This is what independent cinema is all about; a quirky, heartfelt little movie about a misantrhopic dwarf who forms friendships with two slightly dysfunctional people.  It's a bittersweet comedy.  When I saw it in a theater on first release, I left feeling that I'd just seen art done by people who loved art and loved people.  I've watched it a half-dozen times since, and it never ceases to charm me.  I don't have children, but if you do, it's a family-friendly film that I believe would be a wonderful aid in their character development, as they'll see someone who is very different from themselves - a dwarf - is, in reality no different than anyone else.'	5.0	An Absolute Gem	2011-10-19	2	2	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2GPEV42IO41CI	Kona	Fin (Peter Dinklage) is a middle-aged train buff and a dwarf who has been ridiculed his whole life and has no friends. He moves into an abandoned train station, ready to spend the rest of his life alone, but slowly forms friendships with a grieving woman (Patricia Clarkson), an outgoing hot dog man (Bobby Cannavale), and a young librarian (Michelle Williams).What a wonderful movie this is! The story is heartwarming and the strong cast is excellent in well-developed roles. Fin's evolution from morose loner to affable pal is realistic and touching and I enjoyed every bit of his journey (except for the unnecessary profanity, for which I deleted one star).Highly recommended for those who enjoy character-driven, quirky indie films, for train fans, and for  anyone who has ever felt completely alone and hopeless.	4.0	All you need is love...	2013-11-09	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	ALH06I2IGI6YS	Kristen R Thompson	This is what I would call a speed-of-life drama. It moves day by day, experience by experience. Are you the audience that wants to see what happens in the lives of four small-town New Jersey residents? Watch on.One of the major themes explored by the characters - Peter Dinklage as Fin and Patricia Clarkson as Olivia - is how Fin experiences life as a dwarf. His portrayal is fantastic, gifted even; his facial expressions progress with the movie and tell the story at least as well as the dialogue. Moreso, I'm confident in saying.Our culture needs outsider stories more than ever. Almost all of us are outsiders compared to some fictional ideal. But there's a classic writers' rule - show, don't tell. So when Fin tells about getting treated differently because he's a dwarf, it draws attention to the fact that this movie's entire success DEPENDS on the fact that he is a dwarf So yes, he does. But leave it as a plotline, for Fin, not as a life story for Peter. Strike that line from the record, and it's a great film.	4.0	Mixed Feelings	2014-05-08	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A5GG4C0R5JZU0	Kyle A. Herschend	Although the story is brief and uncomplicated, the characters -- in particular, Dinklage's Fin -- are nuanced and engaging. Fin obviously harbors anger over his stature. This anger leads him to shut himself from the world and shun other people. But, little by little, he opens up to two very different individuals -- one a divorcee who recently lost her young child, and the other a dutiful son uprooted from Manhattan. These characters form an unlikely trio, but it maintains believability -- if for no other reason than the sheer improbability of it all (i.e. truth is stranger than fiction).The movie has it's sorrowful moments. It is difficult not to pity Fin for his self-imposed isolation at times. And the divorcee's anguish over her son's death strikes an emotional chord. But the whole picture still manages to render the audience hopeful.And despite the fact the movie ends rather quickly, it satisfies all the needs of the sympathetic viewer. There are no cliff hangers or serious unresolved issues. Everything just fades out peacefully.Good flick. I'd recommend it.	4.0	Peter Dinklage displays superb acting chops	2014-04-12	0	0	0

Basically the story of a young man wanting to live a life of solitude when his friend and boss dies and leaves him an old railroad station and some land in a small quiet town.  After arriving he meets and reluctantly becomes friends with a small but very different group of people, including a woman in mourning who is separated from her husband, a young man (very friendly and surprisingly sweet) who runs a food truck that sets up beside the station, a very young girl and a pregnant librarian.  Touching, smart, surprising.  I want to be their friend and genuinely wish to see them succeed.  We see their highs and their lows.  I recommended this movie to my friends, and family.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A30NHVVC62LJMK	"Libri Mundi ""Libri Mundi"""	If you get a chance watch this movie. You will like it. The movie has very few dialogues but they are superlative. It deals with a difficult topic - dwarfs and the ridicule they go through. Finnbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is the central character and is extremely powerful but quite - he is a dwarf and gets ridiculed left and right but still does not loose his composure (except for once) when he goes to the local bar and gets drunk. But then every human being has his or her weaknesses. Finn loves train and details of train - his dream comes true when he goes for train chasing with his friend Joe (the hot dog vendor). Life is difficult for him but he accepts it in its ways and in his way - rather than fighting it head on, he used diplomacy and works around the difficulties. Thomas McCarthy has done an wonderful job of mixing the characters with the environment even though they all stand out odd. Olivia the local artist who is also suffering from a lose of a son becomes friends with Finn and Joe and in the process befriends her already estranged husband. Just one point - I think the photography - especially the canvas selection and the light effects could have been little better. Still this is one of the year's best movies.	4.0	a great movie with wonderful character potrait	2003-11-22	2	2	0

Dinklage is able to convey a world of expression through his eyes.  Clarkson is just brittle enough to express her character's heartbreak.  Cannavale is the guy I wish had been my older brother's best friend, and Goodwin is totally believable as a child who accepts easily what is difficult for adults.

He is drawn into the lives of a very loud and funny food truck man played perfectly by Bobby Cannavale, a grieving mother played beautifully by Patricia Clarkson and a young librarian played by Michelle Williams.

I am these people.Writer/director Tom McCarthy does a rare thing in modern film-making.  He respects both his audience and his characters enough not to tell the whole story.  When Olivia asks Fin not to stare, when Joe says grace in the most reverently irreverant way, when Fin demands that the crowd ""take a look!""; there are rivers of backstory to all these characters.  And we know what they are without being told.  This film has the sometimes awkward intimacy of a play.  I've never seen anything remotely like it.I hear Dinklage is playing the lead in Richard III.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3SKGQSU29ZV80	Lleu Christopher	Based on the coming attractions for this movie, and even the first few minutes of it, I feared it was going to be an indie film version of a sitcom. Three quirky characters in an improbably deserted New Jersey town could become quickly tedious. The Station Agent, however, turned out to be a pleasant surprise; its characters are real, complex and original people and the interaction between them interesting, realistic and not at all sentimentalized.Peter Dinklage has the starring role as Finbar, a dwarf who inherits an old railroad station house that he moves into. He  soon meets Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a gregarious food vendor and Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), a troubled artist. Both of these people impose themselves on the reclusive Finbar; Joe's meal truck is parked right across from his new home, and Olivia almost runs him over. Finbar is a truly well developed character. Marginalized from society, he takes refuge in his passion for trains. His plight of being treated as an oddity is made clear without making him an object of pity. Only with great reluctance does he gradually open up to his new friends. Joe and Olivia, however, have their own troubles and the relationship among the three is not always smooth.The Station Agent explores what can happen when people who have little in common are brought together by circumstances. Finbar, Olivia and Joe interact  mainly because they find themselves in physical proximity to each other; as events in their lives unfold, their tenuous bond is almost broken. One problem that low budget films often have is a feeling of claustrophobia, as there are only a handful of characters. The Station Agent almost falls into this category (with these three people running into each other everywhere they go), but fortunately there are a few good supporting characters to fill out the landscape; a librarian who finds Finbar attractive, Olivia's ex-husband and a young girl who shares Finbar's fascination with trains.The Station Agent, written and directed by Thomas McCarthy, is slow-paced and character-driven. I highly recommend it to fans of good, original independent films.	4.0	Great character study	2004-06-20	10	7	3

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A6J7GN6ZOR085	lonebeaut	I don't usually watch an entire Prime movie video at one time--I take breaks--but I sat straight through this one and lost track of time. Nothing much happens--it's a character-driven story--but it feels genuine, the dialogue is honest, and the characters seem dead-on real.  The premise is that a dwarf who happens to be a loner and who's obsessed with trains inherits a piece of property in a small New Jersey town that includes an abandoned train depot.  He moves there, meets some locals and becomes friends with them despite his natural reticence and paranoia, and slowly creates a new life.  Sounds boring, but I love films about ordinary people with extraordinary challenges who triumph in the end, even if it's just in a small way (no pun intended).	5.0	A little gem of a movie	2014-03-22	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2JC8IWATIK1I4	Luv 2 Save	Slowed paced but found the main character Peter Dinklage (Finn) to be engaging and interesting right from the beginning, and is able to hold my interest through the entire film.  In the film Finn says that he doesn't understand why people are so interested in him, because he is not that smart or interesting.  Actually the opposite is true, he is an intelligent and interesting person, not because of his size, but because that is part of who he is.  That just kind of comes across.I am glad that Finn was able to over come his challenges and decides to connect rather than continue to try to keep himself isolated from others.One thing that I found a little unlike real life, people don't usually just walk up and start telling you their past or huge issues right out of the blue.  But for the purposes of this movie, it was okay.Over all feel good movie when you are in the mood for something slower paced.	4.0	Enjoyed It.	2014-04-04	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AD38IB5NODZX1	M. 9 Fingers	The story of the Station Agent is not overly complicated, and I won't ruin it through exposition here.  I will  recommend the film highly and try to justify the recommendation without spoilers.  If you are really worried about it, just go watch the movie and stop reading now. . . it's the best advice I can give.Thematically the film deals with isolation from the lives of the people around you for three main characters with divergent reasons for finding themselves removed from the company of others.Don't expect a thrill a minute, fast paced film, but rather a thoughtful story played out with just as much non-verbal emotional content as well-crafted dialogue.  Peter Dinklage is excellent in a role that, ironically, depends entirely on his physical presence as a little person, but offers him a chance to connect with the viewer as so much more than that.  His talent as an actor is quite apparent from the film (and he was recognized with several award wins and nominations) and I felt that the character of Finn gave some real insight into what it is like for someone four-feet five-inches tall on a daily basis without exploiting that premise in any way (as is often the case in the media).Patricia Clarkson also offers a superb performance and she is a personal favorite of mine.  Her appearance in several episodes of Frasier and Six Feet Under and her role in the Green Mile are excellent, but in this movie she really gets the screen time that she deserves, and the result is a film with great spirit, some funny moments and a realistic quality that seems unspoiled by larger studio productions' need to end in utter triumph or dismal trajedy.  This film is more of a character study where the progression of the characters is more subtle and relatable.Please watch this movie.	5.0	Great performances by great character actors	2014-05-08	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3Q8BFRT36IMSS	Mama Mia	Have you ever had a daydream about becoming a hermit?  If so you may find a kindred spirit in the Station Agent's main character, Finbar McBride, played by the talented Peter Dinklage.  Finbar's goal of becoming a recluse is not successful,however, and this may be the main charm of this movie.  Finbar, who just wants to be left alone has to contend with others who intrude upon his self-induced isolation. Enter Joe Oramus,(played by Bobby Cannavale) and Olivia Harris (played by Patricia Clarkson).  This quirky trio seems to share few commonalities.  Joe is the extroverted and devoted son who takes over his dad's hot dog/coffee food truck while his father is ill.  Olivia is a shy artist who is dealing with the death of her young son and the demise of her marriage.  And Finbar is  a train enthusiast who has just lost one of his only friends who has left him an old train depot in the middle of Nowhere New Jersey.  Despite their superficial differences, each character attempts to deal with emotions such as anger, grief, and pain by shutting out the world in their own way. Yet the desire for human connection wins out in the end.  The desire to share both the joys and sorrows in life is what unites these individuals in a strong and loyal friendship.  Their initial tenuous and awkward attempts at connection might make us cringe.  It takes a very patient movie viewer to see the story to the &#34;end&#34; where the characters don't have to work so hard at either actively avoiding or initiating human contact.I found the vicarious journey towards connectedness to be well worth it.  In fact, I can easily say that The Station Agent is my new favorite movie.This is a film that you may have missed when it first came out (2003) but maybe you heard about it recently due to Peter Dinklage's rise to fame from his portrayal of  Tyrion Lannister in the HBO series Game of Thrones, which earned him both an  Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Supporting Actor in 2011.  In fact I was one those people who had never heard of The Station Agent until this year (2014).  I first heard about this film from reading a recent Esquire interview with Peter Dinklage. During the interview Dinklage talks about a random but poignant moment when a clearly distraught woman recognizes him on the street.  She tells him that her boyfriend, who had died that very day, was a huge fan of Dinklage and that The Station Agent had been one of his favorite movies.  The woman took this remarkable chance meeting as some sort of special sign.  Dinklage seemed to think so too and described the event as meaningful.  Intrigued by this interview, I decided that I had to see The Station Agent for myself.For those who said that The Station Agent was not what they expected, I can understand this sentiment.  You really don't know what kind of movie this is until you are well into it.  And for some, it seems that even ten minutes of viewing the movie was enough to call it quits.  This clearly is not a movie to suit everyone's tastes.  While I generally don't like when reviewers categorize people who like or don't like a particular film, I will say that it probably helps if you are an introvert to easily appreciate The Station Agent.  But by no means is introversion a prerequisite for liking or even loving this very unique gem of a film.  Whether you are an introvert or extrovert, the need to be alone with your anger, grief, or pain, is something most of us can relate to and comprehend.The criticism that this movie is &#34;boring&#34; or that &#34;nothing happens&#34; seems to be the consensus of those who gave this film one or two stars.  The fact that there are so many negative reviews, essentially saying the same thing, seems to illustrate the dichotomous nature of movie goers.  There are people who are going to &#34;get&#34; this type of film and those who have no patience for it.  Some reviewers who gave 1-2 stars actually apologized saying in effect, &#34;I really wanted to like this movie but I just didn't.&#34;  Perhaps expectations get in the way of enjoyment of such a film.One of the expectations generating disappointment was that some thought this would be a laugh out loud comedy.  Maybe, at best, The Station Agent could be described as a dark comedy.  The humor was there but it was very refined and subtle. Some people wanted more action.  Although a lot happens in this film as far as personal growth and change, no, there is not much action packed drama.  Yet the lack of action was a plus for me.  The slowness of the film forced me to slow down as well.  It was only then that I could appreciate the specialness of waiting for a train or even the beauty of what we consider to be awkward silences.  And too, there were those who called this a depressing film.  I can understand how that description could be derived yet having watched the entire movie, I felt the opposite of depressed.  I felt inspired. There was growth for each of the characters, however slow it seemed to happen. The Station Agent seems to be one of those movies that you either love or hate.And too I think a lot of people might get caught up in the fact that the main character is a little person.  While this fact is addressed in The Station Agent, and sometimes quite profoundly (the bar scene where he stands on the counter), it is not the central theme of the movie.  Finbar hold's his own, if you will.  The viewer is not guided to self-indulge in pity or in lofty admiration for Finbar but rather, to see him as a regular guy who happens to have dwarfism.Overall I was entranced by the beauty of this film.  It speaks to anyone who has aspired to become a hermit, but underneath, really wishes for companionship.  Sitting on a porch, taking in the fresh air, and sharing a laugh.  These are the moments that friends cherish.  If you give it a chance, this is the film to remind you.	5.0	For Aspiring Hermits Everywhere...	2014-05-21	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1B05INWIDZ74O	M. A. Ramos	Fin McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a dwarf who works in a model train store and just loves his job. Only problem is he is made fun of and except for his boss, has no friends. A short ways into the movie, his boss dies and leaves him an abandoned train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey. He packs up his meager belongings and sets out for this remote country place where he can at least be left alone.When he arrives at the station he finds that it is right next to the still-active railroad tracks. It is run down and it only has a couch to sleep on, no phone, nor any other utilities. He seems satisfied that he can live his life of train watching in solitude. But the first morning, he is awakened by Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a sociable young man whose hot-dog truck is parked right next to the depot. Joe is very persistent in wanting to be Fin's friend and he never seems to stop talking. Another would be friend is Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), who he meets because she nearly runs over him twice in the same day with her car.Fin does all he can to avoid these new acquaintances by taking long walks on the railroad right-of-way and checking the timing of the trains at a bridge. But they manage to wear him down. They learn a little bit more about each other every time and learn to respect each other's privacy as well.This film shows us how important friendship is and how it grows. That you should not judge people by how they look, but what they do. And that no one really wants to be a loner. It is an incredible film. I was enthralled watching these three flawed characters come to life on the screen and watch them form their friendship. I recommend you watch this film.	5.0	A Story of Friendship	2004-12-22	5	4	1

After he arrives at the depot, he meets two locals who add comedy and drama to this story. The three become friends and the film looks into how the two locals are drawn to the mysterious Fin and his world of trains. The film moves slowly and quietly drawing you into the small-town story of these ordinary but extraordinary people.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2B6VI9MQI0WKI	Matthew Gladney	"It becomes apparent early on that ""The Station Agent"" is not your usual film. It sets a slow, methodical pace which will not satisfy the typical multi-plex audiences. It presents characters without offering a lot of explanation for them. You are required to pay attention to how they act in order to find out who they are. There are no long, informative, tell-all speeches by these people, the kind that you would find in a more mainstream movie. And, somewhat surprisingly, there is no real resolution to the three main lives that the film touches upon. And yet, somehow it all works.Peter Dinklage plays the lead role in ""The Station Agent"". He is Finbar McBride, a solitary man who works with an older black gentleman named Henry in a Main Street-style shop which sells & repairs model trains. Henry and Fin are train enthusiasts, and even watch home movies other people have made that are nothing more than different camera angles of trains. When Henry dies suddenly, Fin discovers that his friend has bequeathed him a half-acre of land in Newfoundland, New Jersey. On the land is an old train depot, where the station agent used to reside. Here is where Fin decides he will go and live, and it is where the main point of the movie begins.Across the tracks from the train depot is Joe, an obviously lonely young man who runs a portable coffee and hot dog stand. He quickly rushes to befriend Fin, but finds it at first to be of some difficulty. Fin, you see, is a dwarf, and has put up a protective barrier to shield himself from what can often be an unkind and unthinking humanity. When Joe invites Fin to the local tavern, the dwarf refuses. We later find out why. Though Fin tries to separate himself from people, he is only human, and therefore becomes resentful of his home-made prison of loneliness. This leads to him eventually accepting Joe's goofy version of friendship. The third lonely person added to the mix is Olivia, a forty-something woman who has recently lost her child through death, and her husband through mutual separation. Olivia is not only lonely, but also fragile and unstable. Together these three lost souls attempt to bolster each other through simple companionship. Sometimes it works, while other times it doesn't. Add into the mix two more lonely people: a young librarian woman who takes a physical interest in Fin, and a little girl named Cleo who likes to hang out with Fin and old abandoned trains more than with kids her own age, and you have a movie full of disheartened, dejected characters.But ""The Station Agent"" is certainly a unique film. It moves at its own pace, and tells its story through what the characters say, rather than what they explain. Have you ever noticed that, in most movies, if a character has some deep, dark pain in their life, there will inevitably come a scene (or perhaps multiple scenes) where the character will unload and explain everything that's going on with them? They will provide life history, present angst, and maybe even future worries. Not so with ""The Station Agent"". You'd just better pay attention to what these people say, as unimportant as it sometimes may sound, and as infrequently as it may come, if you want to grasp what's really going on with them and what their roles are within the film. This is not a movie for relaxing and letting your mind glaze over. This is a movie which treats the viewer with respect. It assumes you are intelligent and alert. And I appreciate that. My only real complaint with the film is that there are still some unanswered questions that the writer/director could have taken some time in answering, although I suppose they are not super-vital to the story.The acting job by the three leads - Peter Dinklage as Fin, Bobby Cannavale as Joe, and Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, is realistic and superb. These definitely feel like characters, not actors. If the locations used for Newfoundland, New Jersey are not real, then they sure did a good job making them seem as if they were. There is such a flavor of truth to the whole film that it can only help propel it to a higher level of entertainment. And a special mention should be made for Stephen Trask, incidental music composer. His work here fits in perfectly with the mood of the movie.""The Station Agent"" is not your typical movie-going experience, but that is a good thing. It is a slowly unfolding film about lonely people who find each other and do what they can to help themselves through the kind of companionship that only humanity can provide, in its unique, quirky way. It doesn't explain, it simply 'is'. The characters seem like real people, and we find that they are easy to relate to. Already you have the pieces in place for a great movie. And ""The Station Agent"" does not fail in that regard."	4.0	Letting It Unfold	2003-12-08	9	8	1

Suffice it to say, this is a film to watch and watch only.  Don't be distracted by anything else.

Through happenstance the three characters find their lives becoming intertwined as each one was missing the integrity of true friendship/relationship (and not in a sexual way). It is the small things, showing kindness, small gifts, a listening ear, without judgement, that impacts others lives. One does not end the movie with hands raised and shouting, ""Yes,"" but with a much more reflective, ""they needed each other.""Definitely worth the four stars as the characters were so relatable as many are a reflection of those in our own lives - the good, the bad, and the ugly.Enjoy"	4.0	A Reflection of Life	2014-03-22	2	2	0
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3W443V4IZJOTE	"Megan D. Kasten ""soccer mom"""	Here's a brief quiz to help you decide whether this movie will be to your liking:Which Jim Carrey movie appeals to you more: Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls or Man on the Moon?If you prefer Ace Ventura and never even heard of Man on the Moon (biopic about quirky comedian Andy Kaufman), then The Station Agent is probably not your style. That's a generalization, of course, but some of the reviews I've read about The Station Agent have been unfairly negative based seemingly on the viewers' expectations. If you go into it looking for a quiet, in depth character study about human beings trying to find where they fit in the world, you have come to the right place. But viewers looking for fart jokes will be bitterly disappointed. (note: Jim Carrey is not in this movie, but those 2 disparate films in his repertoire seemed an apt comparison to the differing comedic styles.)There are enough plot synopses around that other reviewers have done better than I could, so I won't put you through reading yet another. Suffice it to say that if you are ready to snuggle up for the evening and watch 3 people muddle through the awkward beginnings of friendship, saddled with their past experiences and heartaches, this movie will reward you with great performances and an honest, clear-eyed view of their lives.	5.0	If you like a small film with great, subtle characters, you can stop looking.	2014-03-18	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A5ZVPY8LYTTH1	mhazlitt	This is a very rewarding movie. It gives a character portrait of a dwarf without being preachy. (The actor playing the dwarf went on to fame in &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;.) The setting, a small town in New Jersey, has real weight, the houses and the bar and the railroad memorable, and the actors, many of them quite well known, inhabit their roles. No one is a stereotype. The plot meanders, which is better than if it were about someone who had fallen, dusted himself off, and triumphed. The movie doesn't try to accomplish too much, and so accomplishes a lot. I particularly liked the hot dog cart because it was so shabby that it reminded me of places I have been or passed up. This is what Hollywood does so well when it foregoes a big budget and focuses on visualizing a story and an atmosphere.	4.0	An Excellent Little Movie	2014-04-02	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1TJPMB7N776WS	MICHAEL ACUNA	"Fin (Peter Dinklage) wants to be left alone. He works in a Model Train Shop, where he is not likely to be seen. His major passion and love is Trains: loves the romance of them, their ability to take you away from it all, the bigness and solidity of them. Because of his size, Fin has had a troubled life and he avoids people like the plague so as not to be wounded. He has one friend, a fellow Train Shop worker who dies one day and leaves Fin a Train Station House and an acre of surrounding land. And Fin goes there to live out his life as far away from those who have hurt him his entire life. But he didn't count on Joe (handsome, robust, smack-talking but lovable Bobby Carnavale), a snack truck vendor or Olivia (lithe, sensitive, barely able to keep it together Patricia Clarkson), a neighbor who is trying to get over the loss of her son and a divorce.The dynamics of these three is interestingly askew in that Fin, wary and committed to the notion that he will always be alone and without friends, is actively pursued by Joe for that very thing: friendship. And Olivia, having literally run Fin off a road twice, seeks Fin's forgiveness at first, then ultimately his friendship. It's like the old adage: when you want it, you can't get it and when you don't, it's there for the taking.""The Station Agent"" is a gentle, quiet film. One that concentrates on the small wonders and circumstances of a life lived in a solitary manner. It's about what happens when you finally find people who look beyond what there is to see on the outside and seek out the very core of your being and more importantly, find it in all its brilliance and resonant splendor."	5.0	Digging For It	2003-11-29	1	1	0

As you begin to meet them you start likeing them for their faults and flaws.  The movie is about the good in everyone and slowing down to actually walk in someone elses shoes.  People are not perfect and this movie takes you through the beauty of seeing that in others and accepting people for who they are.  I can't give this a high enough rating.

As the story progresses, the misfits bond, and though they still see themselves in the same light, the viewer becomes aware of the fact that these three pretty much represent us all. Too bad that there aren&#8217;t very many roles for little people in the movie industry. Peter Dinklage is a first rate actor.	5.0	Quirky but provocative	2014-03-18	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"Tom McCarthy's ""The Station Agent"" is the sort of movie that--if it even gets made in America--seldom makes it past the festival circuit to a wider audience. That ""The Station Agent"" did so is an unexpected and delightful surprise. This gentle, poignant film--which unfolds like a perfectly wrought short story--tells the tale of Fin (Peter Dinklage), a four-foot five-inch, thirtysomething guy who works in a model train store and has a lifelong fascination with trains. Used to the mockery of those around him, he lives devoid of human contact other than his sympathetic boss and a few fellow train enthusiasts. When his boss dies, he leaves Fin a decrepit train depot in a rural part of New Jersey; Fin, having no other place that will take him in, goes to the depot to live. There, almost against his will, he begins to establish contact with a few of the local residents, including two who in their own ways are as lonely as Fin: Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a convivial, motormouth hot dog vendor saddled with a chronically ill father, and Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), an eccentric artist grieving over the loss of her small son and her bitter estrangement from her husband. How Fin, Joe and Olivia slowly, clumsily discover their common bonds forms the main story of ""The Station Agent."" It's scarcely an earth-shattering story, and the low budget is always evident; yet ""The Station Agent"" never puts a foot wrong. The story and dialogue continually offer small, revealing surprises about the characters, and the performances of Dinklage, Clarkson and Cannavale are exquisitely natural and unaffected. ""The Station Agent"" is a movie most people will probably never hear of, but those who see it will cherish it."	5.0	A perfect slice of life.	2003-11-05	114	110	4

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A27HW1OYRZC8WI	mimi	I did not know what to expect when I started this one. But, the rating for me, would have been five stars if it wasn't for some what I thought were unnecessary scenes. Watching the female lead sitting in front of her mirror in her underwear did not add to her character or motivations whatsoever. Other than that I found it to be enjoyable, a little SLICE OF LIFE type of film.  If you are looking for Hollywood action, Victoria's Secret models, magazine hunks,  sex, blood, fantasy superheroes or characters, forget it!!!  This was a pleasant reprieve from all of that.  It made me want more, at the end, wanted to see these peoples continuing stories.....Just a nice pleasant film,  that I  will enjoy watching over.	4.0	HOLLYWOOD REPRIEVE  (yay!)	2014-07-02	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	&quot;The Station Agent&quot; is a quiet, quirky little character drama set in the rural town of Newfoundland, New Jersey. Fin McBride (Peter Dinklage) is an ordinary man who can't seem to escape the constant attention of strangers because he is a dwarf. When he inherits an abandoned train station, complete with station agent's building, in this remote New Jersey town, he jumps at the chance to become a recluse. Upon moving into the station, he discovers that it is not as out of the way as he might have hoped. A very friendly coffee and hot dog vendor named Joe (Bobby Cannavale) sets up shop practically on his doorstep every day. Though he might try, Fin can't avoid Joe or Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson), an accident-prone artist who lives nearby.&quot;The Station Agent&quot; is about three people who at first glance might appear to have nothing in common beyond a coffee stand. But these people are interesting, and it's interesting to watch them develop a friendship, sometimes in spite of themselves. Thomas McCarthy has written a fine character piece and directed an attractive film, but these characters could have easily been two-dimensional without superb performances from the actors. Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson, and Bobby Cannavale have made the recluse, the grieving woman, and the motor-mouth interesting individuals who are full of life. They're people whom we might not mind running into if we were passing through their neck of the woods, which is a great achievement for a writer or casting director. &quot;The Station Agent &quot; presents the vitality in life's hardships and the value of unlikely friendships without being overbearing.The DVD: Bonus features include deleted scenes and an audio commentary by writer/director Thomas McCarthy and actors Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson, and Bobby Cannavale. The commentary is very conversational and pretty constant, without many breaks when nothing is said. The participants talk about their experiences filming the movie and, in doing so, convey a lot of affection for the project.	4.0	3 Interesting Characters.  3 Engaging Performances.	2004-06-19	4	3	1

This one gets there and if you had nothing better to do, its worth a watch.The idea was very good and unique. The actors were superb in getting down their parts.  All in all, it did keep me engaged.  But when the story was getting interesting finally, the writers jumped right into typical Hollywood romantic comedy formula (no this isn't a romantic comedy really...but when you watch it...you'll probably get what I mean).I'm glad it was free on Amazon Prime.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3DE9GQDO6O6D1	"Nancy R. Katz ""NancyK18"""	"The Station Agent is one of those movies that begins slowly but then grabs the viewer and doesn't let go.  More than anything it teaches viewers that ""families"" come in all sorts and types.Finn, a dwarf played by Peter Dinklage, works for a store, which specializes in toy trains and their repair.  He is also a member of a train club, which chases trains and videotapes their train rides, or chases.  Sullen and withdrawn Finn inherits a piece of land in New Jersey with a depot on the grounds when his boss dies. Retreating to the depot, he finds a brash, loud and outgoing young man, Joe played by Booby Cannevale who is working at his father roadside coffee stand. Joe tried to reach out to Finn and slowly immerses himself in Finn's life, walking the train tracks with him and filming a train as they ride along in his car. Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, an artist who is separated from her husband and grieving for her young son who was killed, plays the third member of this unlikely trio. The three of them slowly become friends and one can't help but get the feeling that these are real people rather than actors playing roles. How they reach out to one another and form their ties is the basis for this movie and one well worth seeing.  While Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannevale are well suited for their roles, the movie ultimately belongs to Finn as he comes to terms with his size and desires.I laughed, I cried and I thoroughly enjoyed this film.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1129LM24YWSZV	"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw"""	In The Station Agent, director and screenwriter Thomas McCarthy introduces us to Finn, a dwarf who works in a model train store. When the store's owner dies, Finn discovers that the man (quite possibly his only friend) willed him a small train depot. Finn moves to the depot, most likely planning to live the life of a hermit and grieve the death of his friend. However, two new friends - the lonely Olivia (struggling with the death of her son and the dissolution of her marriage) and goofy Joe (who runs a hotdog stand near the depot and seems desperate for companionship) - seem to have other plans. It doesn't sound like much to hang a movie on, but I thought this was a great character-driven film. The performances turned in by all of the primary actors - Peter Dinklage as Finn, Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, and Bobby Cannavale as Joe - were exceptional. At first, I had a hard time warming up to Finn. However, the viewer quickly realizes that Finn has developed a tough hide in order to better endure the cruelties of being a dwarf. By the end of the movie, Dinklage allowed the character to soften a bit, and he ended up winning me over. Cannavale had some masterful scenes. He does such a good job of playing the well-meaning but somewhat annoying sidekick that it is difficult not to fall in love with him immediately. Clarkson, who seems at first a ditzy artist, quickly turns such pigeonholing on its ear, displaying remarkable depth when discussing her dead son and her failing marriage.All in all, I thought this was a great movie about what it is to be someone who both craves isolation and companionship.	5.0	A great indie film	2005-09-06	3	3	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2YHC7R0D592W	Nik	"Dinklage is spectacular in this film. It's a pity that the roles in Hollywood for small people are so limited (and ordinarily so stupid: elves, munchkins, jesters.)--Dinklage outshines most of his contemproraries and this is likely to be one of the few big, serious roles he will ever be given. (Maybe CG will get to the point where films will incorporate special effects that are the reverse of the ""hobbitizing"" done in the LOTR movies--turning Dinklage into a Cary Grant!)This film has a great set of oddball supporting characters, too: an overly needy hotdog seller, a spaced-out artist mourning the death of her son, a train-loving elementary school kid, and a very young (and newly pregnant) librarian ""hottie."" Dinklage plays the irritable Fin, who has inherited a decaying train station in rural New Jersey from a friend. Fin plans to move to the out-of-the-way spot and live in complete isolation. He soon runs into a wacky cast of characters (in some cases literally; Olivia, the artist, runs him off the road twice in one day) who won't leave him alone. Each has their own emotional baggage and their own peculiar hurts and disabilities. Against all odds, the motley crew become friends. The plot summaries for this film make it sound like a sapfest, but this movie is far from it. It is sort of ""touching,"" but in a of burr-like sort of way: prickly, a bit odd, and it sticks with you for a long time after."	5.0	Not your run-of-the-mill film: eccentric, with a great cast of wacko characters	2006-06-21	3	3	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A35IW20X5N3CEB	Novelwit2000	Real quick, I want to say that the 'one' star I'm giving this film goes WHOLE heartedly to Peter Dinklage.  In my opinion, he's like the 3M Company, in that he might not create the scene, but he sure does make the scene better.Virtually everything in the movie that he does, I get.  And I get the whole 'I want to be left alone' thing that he does throughout the movie.  What I don't get, is why the people around him can't respect that.  All that seems to go on with the two other main characters is that they want to ingratiate themselves on him, and for what purpose I'd like to know?And the thing with the hotdog vendor, you mean to tell me that he's from Manhattan, where there's probably a million people wandering the streets, and he's going to set up shop at a nowhere spot in the middle of nowhere?  How's he supposed to make money? Come on!And that's another problem with the screenplay.  I mean, is the Peter Dinklage character supposed to be independently weatlthy or something?  How does he get his money for stuff--like the coffee and ALL those cigarettes?And how does the Bobby Cannavale character suppose to live in Manhattan (of all places) if he can't even sell enough coffee to fill his gas tank?This movie, I don't know?  It left a lot of questions for me.  I couldn't even get into the Patricia Clarkson character very much.  I mean, I know she's hurting because she lost her son.  But, I think it was the way the movie presented this plight.  I mean, it's kinda hard to feel anything, when we (the audience) didn't have the chance to know her son too.  (I mean, it's just the way things should be presented in a movie--so you get to feel for and grow with the characters.)  I can't see where this was done right with this movie.All in all, I hate it when filmmakers go about making these 'quirky' little movies that don't really say very much and don't do very much.  I mean, remember when a 'quirky' movie was something like that gem of a movie:  Harold & Maude.  Or maybe even the original version of Sweet November?  Now that's the kind of quirk that I can get into--quirk with a point.  Quirk with great story telling.  I don't know what the Station Agent was trying to tell?Either way, if you want to see Peter Dinklage in something good, then PLEASE check out his performance in Season 4 of Nip/Tuck.  In my opinion, he made the WHOLE season.  Peter Dinklage is what great acting is all about.  Can't wait to see what he does next!!!	1.0	I think I may still be waiting for my train to come in.	2008-01-10	43	8	35

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	ARMVAHWQQ9S8A	"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand"""	"I'm picky and usually unwilling to try new things.  So when I had to watch this movie for a film class, I--with a deep sigh--went out to Blockbuster and rented the movie, put it in my DVD player--adding one more sigh, in case the point hasn't been made--and began to watch the movie, ready to take notes on all the technical aspects and whatnot.  I was so engrossed in the film by the time ten minutes had passed that I was ready to abandon my assignment (the note taking) and simply enjoy the movie.It would be easy to say that the every day struggles of a dwarf, or any `little person' for that matter, makes up the drama in ""The Station Agent.""  There certainly would be enough evidence to back it up: Kids make fun of Finn (the main character, who happens to be a dwarf), adults--sometimes--do not notice him, and when they do, they often embarrass him; they take pictures of him and even heckle him the same way that children do.  However, when one looks deeper into the movie, they can see that the movie makes a statement on communication:  No one knows how to properly communicate with Finn--or other people like him--properly, which has convinced him to become a withdrawn person.I'm certainly not going to give anything away, but I'll tell you this.  Two characters are introduced into Finn's life that cause... maybe FORCE is a better term...him to open up, to show them who he truly is.  It makes for a funny, touching, and inspiring drama.  The writing and the direction is top notch, each line and each shot conscious of the theme of the film and furthering what can only be described as an intense character study of Finn and the people who surround him.For anyone wanting an enjoyable movie with a very tight story, centered not on action or melodrama, but a subtle look into the life of a man named Finn McBride, I recommend this film.  I not only enjoyed it, but I also took something out of it:  I'm going to be more open-minded with my choices in the future, because I wound up being very glad that I had experienced this movie.9/10"	5.0	Started As An Assignment...	2007-09-20	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2ODBHT4URXVXQ	"Peggy Vincent ""author and reader"""	Peter Dinklage is a wonderful actor with a huge emotional range in his body language and facial expressions, and he also happens to be one of the 'little people.' For whatever reason might be at the root of his obsession, he's a nut for trains. He works in a model train shop, and then one day the owner falls over dead and Dinklage finds that he has inherited an abandoned depot in rural NJ. He walks there, following the tracks. In fact, a lot of the movie occurs while one character or another is walking along the tracks.He makes several friends in his new community, but two are destined to become real keepers, and both of them are suffering from loss. Patricia Clarkson has lost a child, and a wacky Bobby Cannavale, the guy who runs a mobile coffee stand, is trying hard to care for an ailing father who makes unreasonable demands on him. There's also a pretty librarian who comes to rely on Dinklage, a plumb African-American 8yo who persuades him to come to her school as a show and tell specimen, some rough town guys who make the usual midget jokes, and others.Not a whole lot happens, but by the end, you realize you've watched the anatomy of friendship develop right in front of your eyes.	4.0	Sweet without being sticky	2004-07-28	8	6	2

It is not ones size that we should be concerned with.  True honest giving frienship is special as it creates a magnificent bond that can help overcame many challenges.  Enjoyment at times can came from the simplicity of being true to one self.  It is not what we accumulate what makes us successful rather is those we have the pribiledge of calling friends.  The movie in its simplicity explores simple humanity interaction and enjoyment.	5.0	Superb Movie for all to Watch	2014-04-01	0	0	0

This movie was not a snoozer.  I felt myself drifting and told myself I needed to sleep (it was after 12am) but this great storyline kept me hooked.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1TPW86OHXTXFC	"prisrob ""pris,"""	'The Station Agent ' is the kind of superb film you want to share with everyone! It is a slow feel good film with no real direction nor any real ending.Fin, a four foot five inch small person, played by Peter Dinklage, has inherited an outpost dilapidated train Agent's Station in the wilds of New Jersey. This is a small desolate town, and the train station is right up Fin's alley. He is a man turned into himself, it appears after much teasing and bullying as a child and as an adult, he prefers time to himself. He has turned into a loner for self preservation.  He finds this agent station fits him well. And, then, comes along Joe, played by Bobby Cannavale, a high strung, talkative, Cuban who is running his dad's food truck. He parks the truck near Fin's new home, so coffee is readily available.  Fin is run into, literally, by Olivia, played by Patricia Clarkson.. She is an artist, mourning her lost marriage and her dead son. These three people come together, unusual friends, but each of them have a need that the other seems to fill. Fast friends they become after several stops and go. Chole, a young black girl is attracted to Fin, and he feels comfortable with her. Fin takes daily walks to learn about the town and to follow the trains, his obsession. Soon, his friends are walking with him. Through trials and tribulations, this film fills a need within all of us. The acting is superb, the filming lovely and the storyline, so important in this day and age of estrangement from each other.Highly Recommended.

""Horse lady"""	I'm just sorry it took me so many years to actually watch this film.......superb indie dramedy with great characters and subtle but engaging plot.  For those of you who want action films to tweak your 5-star ratings, don't bother.  This film is so much more:  Thoughtful, and at many times quite funny.  Seems to me to comment on our society's alienation of those who are different, but more importantly, makes it so obvious that those who may be different in some way still are human and share the same desires and cares that most of us share.  To be a friend, to need a friend, and to be seen as important in the eyes of others, and to be seen as a whole person who wants to be respected and needed and have those emotions returned, as well. This is one I will ask my adolescent and teenage kids to watch......  Kudos to the director, the writer, and to the three actors for creating such a great film!	5.0	Excellent!	2014-05-15	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2JL8QQHG6DA5R	P. Wandzel	Although I had watched the movie previously a few years ago, I decided to watch it again recently.  I liked it even more the second time around.  The movie, about a dwarf who has only one person he can call a friend, inherits an abandoned railroad station house and soon finds himself surrounded by people drawn to him first out of curiousity, then by something deeper.  The main character, Fin, finds his life changing, at first, against his will, then by choice.  Viewers are pulled along for the ride, mesmerized by the timing, not too fast, not too slow.  Just like an old-fashioned train.	5.0	Sweet Movie	2014-03-18	1	1	0

Not only does he experience the loss of his friend, but Finbar seems to be having an existential crisis, which makes for vulnerability.  Ask anyone who has lived in isolation for a length of time: this predicament is unnatural for the human animal.Enter other lonely hearts, the son of an invalid, hawking hotdogs, Bobby Cannavale, Mr. Bilingual.  Enter a divorced artist with a recently deceased son, Patricia Clarkson.  Clarkson proves herself incapable of driving her SUV which gives us some chuckles when little Finbar must avoid catastrophe.Look, nothing earthshaking in this Indy production, but some nice touches here and there with likable eccentrics.	3.0	Nice Touches	2006-03-24	4	1	3

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A12X2J7AVZ04IQ	"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan"""	Tom McCarthy has crafted a film of utmost sensitivity, insight and relevance. Aside from his witty script and insightful direction, the real power is created by the flawless performance of Peter Dinklage, a character of strong principle, suspicious of strangers. Along come the delightful  characters that melt his cold, empty heart, and make him alive again. Even though the excellent Patricia Clarkson got the best reviews, I thought Bobby Cannavale was the most alive, delightful character, a despairing individual, looking for a real friend. Michelle Williams, too, is so complete, sweetness personified. I can't blab away the plot, but how these characters come together and learn to love and overcome their angst is a credit to fine acting, direction and a very clever script. A small world is created that totally envelops the viewer, and the viewer actually cares. I waited too long to watch this film.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	The Station Agent (Tom McCarthy, 2003)It says something about the state of filmmaking and popular culture in America that The Station Agent won or was nominated for thirty-one awards at various places, including winning the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, the Audience award at Sundance (where it was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize), and three Independent Spirit Awards, but between the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, The Station Agent was nominated for, and won, zero. Perhaps someone at the Academy needs to put their ear a little closer to the ground, because all those other film societies really knew what they were doing here.The Station Agent is the story of Finbar McBride (indie favorite Peter Dinklage, of Safe Men and Living in Oblivion fame), a train enthusiast from north Jersey. Upon the death of his best friend Henry (Do the Right Thing's Paul Benjamin), he inherits an old train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey. After the will's executor tells him there's nothing for miles around there, Fin moves down and sets up shop. He didn't however, count on the local hot dog stand setting up in his parking lot, run by the garrulous Joe (100 Centre St.'s Bobby Cannavale), eccentric artist Olivia (three-time-Best-Actress-award-winning Patricia Clarkson, recently in Wendigo, Far from Heaven, and The Safety of Objects), lonely town librarian Emily (Dawson's Creek alum Michelle Williams), or inquisitive schoolgirl Clea (Raven Goodwin of Lovely and Amazing, in her second screen appearance), all of whom latch onto Fin in different ways, and for different reasons. How's a guy to be left alone?This whole cast is simply tremendous, but it is Clarkson who truly shines. She always brings a touch of greatness to everything she touches. Goodwin proves herself a capahle enough actress at playing herself; hopefully we will soon have her in a role where she can show her talent. Cannavale and Dinklage make great foils for one another, and their energy does a good deal to move the story along. Put all of this together with the simplest of stories, how people interact, and you could end up with something stolid and motionless (like The Big Chill), or you could end up with something brilliant (like The Breakfast Club). The Station Agent falls, without a single toe over the line, on the side of brilliance. It takes a while to get going; twenty of the film's eighty-nine minutes are setup (and more was planned, judging by the deleted scenes, most of which are pieces of Fin and Henry's interaction; they're wonderful disembodied pieces, but would have dragged out an already-too-long beginning). But once you get the ball rolling, there is a great deal to be loved about The Station Agent. ****	4.0	One of the best films of 2003.	2004-07-26	6	5	1

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"I do not damn with faint praise when calling this a ""small"" film, nor when doing so is any offense intended to Peter Dinklage who plays the role of Finbar McBride, the central character. After the death of his employer and friend who owns a store offering model railroads and various accessories, McBride learns that he has inherited from him an abandoned train station and sets out on foot to begin a new life there. Only four-foot tall, by now he has endured all of the hurtful jokes and taunts about dwarfs, ""Munchkins,"" etc. He seeks solitude in what seems to be an eminently appropriate residence, given his passion for railroading in all shapes and sizes. McBride arrives and establishes residence, determined to have minimal contact with others who live in the town nearby. Unexpectedly and at first reluctantly, he becomes friends with Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) and then Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson), both of whom sense within McBride a stature belied by his diminutive body. This is a ""small"" film in the sense that under Thomas McCarthy's brilliant direction, it is fully developed within quite limited parameters. (I am reminded of the fact that the greatest athletes ""play within themselves."") I can think of nothing to delete from this film, nor of anything to add. Also, to their credit,  McCarthy and his cast resist every opportunity to sentimentalize (thereby trivialize) any of the lead characters' weaknesses as well as strengths. Finbar, Olivia, and Joe struggle (with mixed success) in their relationships with each other. Their behavior is not always admirable. But separately and together, they celebrate the nature of humanity, whatever the shape and form of it may prove to be."	5.0	A Celebration of Humanity	2004-02-26	77	67	10

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"Thomas McCarthy's ""The Station Agent"" is a joyous and wondrous tale of three rather unique and quirky individuals whose lives intersect at an abandoned train depot in rural New Jersey.When a dwarf named Fin inherits the station from a business partner, he moves there, hoping to find a place where he will finally be free from all the prying eyes, pointing fingers and knowing smiles he's been subjected to all his life.  However, Fin finds that, even in isolation, it's not always easy to be alone.  As soon as he takes up residence in his new abode, he meets up with Olivia and Joe, two people with whom he seems to have little in common, but with whom he manages to forge a lasting friendship.  Olivia is a struggling artist who lost her young son two years earlier in a freak accident.  Grief-stricken and trying to put the pieces of her life back together, Olivia experiences major mood swings that make it hard for others to get close to her, no matter how hard they try.  Fin, likewise, is a shy, taciturn young man who has pretty much given up the possibility that he will ever be able to have a ""normal"" relationship with other people (let alone women). Thus, he turns inward, throwing up barriers in an effort to keep people out of his life, hoping that, by doing so, he will avoid getting hurt any further.  Joe, on the other hand, is a garrulous young Cuban who runs a hot dog stand right outside Fin's station, a man who chatters on endlessly about any subject and sees nothing wrong with forcing himself into Fin's life, blithely unaware that his company is the last thing Fin wants.  Yet, Joe is so openhearted and good-natured that even Fin, though desperately craving privacy and silence, hasn't the heart to dampen the young man's desire for companionship and friendship.  Somehow, through the trials and tribulations of daily living, these three strangers develop a bond of friendship, love and mutual support.The set-up for ""The Station Agent"" could have led to any number of serious pitfalls, given its potential for unbridled quirkiness and feel-good sentimentality  However, McCarthy has managed to walk that fine line between preciousness and charm, contrivance and originality, calculation and spontaneity.  He has fashioned an adroit screenplay filled with likable characters, rueful humor, clever one-liners and restrained slapstick.  The film is less concerned with storyline and plot than it is with tone, mood and character interaction.  Throughout the film, we seem to be eavesdropping on the lives of these people, understanding that we will never fully know all the life experiences that have gone into making them the people they are today, but happy to spend just this little bit of time with them anyway.""The Station Agent"" is a masterpiece of fine acting, with Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale delivering pitch-perfect, bell-ringing performances.  As the reticent dwarf, Dinklage is particularly brilliant at creating a character out of little more than body language and facial expressions.  His work here offers definitive proof that some of the greatest acting and character development can be accomplished with a minimum of dialogue."	4.0	a genuine charmer	2004-12-13	7	6	1

I had heard about it in passing, and it was recommended to me on Netflix, so I decided to check it out.  Man, I am SO glad I did!!  This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, and I can't really explain why.  Fin's character, while aloof at first, becomes extremely endearing, and I found myself drawn to all three main characters in different ways.  The movie is about friendship, tolerance, ignorance....it is profoundly complex, but at the same time, incredibly simple.

There's little comedy here, outside the fine performance of Bobby Cannavale, who plays an average Joe with more sensitivity than one typically finds in Average Joes). The movie progresses slowly as an emotionally devastated woman (Patricia Clarkson) befriends a dwarf (Peter Dinklage). Dinklage, having spent much of his life harassed, humiliated, or angry at having been born little in a big world, slowly works his way out of his emotional bunker to help Clarkson deal with grief. Cannavale is a rare &#34;accept you at face value&#34; individual who is there for them both.	4.0	Uncompromising performances and gritty plot make Station Agent a powerful drama	2014-04-14	1	1	0

Bobby Canavale's Joe is so sweet and funny, without feeling staged.  And Patricia Clarkson and Peter Dinkladge have always intrigued me with their work.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2EC7QX2XCSNZW	"Sharad Yadav ""shayad"""	This is a an impressive independent movie. The theme is seemingly simple, but is very well layered. Each character can be as complex as you want it to be. Only a tiny facet of each character has been exposed and the remaining facets are for the viewer to imagine and explore.The movie revolves around Fin (Peter Dinklage), who has retired from active service and by happenstance inherited  (from a close friend) a railway depot in remote Newfoundland. Fin runs into a an extrovert Joe (Bobby Cannavale) who reluctantly runs a mobile coffee & snack shop. Fin has a strange friend in the form of Olivia (Patricia Clarkson) who is going through an on-the-brink marriage. The trio become good friends: Fin reserved most of the times, Olivia quirky and Joe hilariously talkative. Fin has a passion for trains and loves watching trains steaming on track trains. Olivia gifts a video-camera to Fin. Fin and Joe team up to become train chasers, recording chugging trains.The friendship slowly takes deep roots. Olivia starts getting anxiety pangs because of her breaking marriage and wards of Fin to get into a depressed seclusion. Fin attempts to help Olivia, but she closes the door on her time and again. The friendship gets strained, but doesn't break. The watchful and caring Fin distances himself from Olivia, but keeps a careful watch. One day, he finds an unconscious Olivia (she attempted suicide) and rushes her to the hospital to the hospital. Olivia survives and their friendship resurrects strong as ever.In one of scenes, Fin is walking along the road and almost gets run over by Olivia who was fiddling with her cell phone. Hilariously, the very next day Olivia almost runs over Fin again (this time she spills coffee all over herself and veers of course).There are a lot of wonderful scenes in the movie that have no dialogs at all, just beautiful subtle expressions.	5.0	Very Impressive ...	2005-11-19	5	4	1

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	"""The Station Agent"" is the kind of film that exists outside of genre or one line descriptions. Its twists and turns are so subtle and unexpected that easy synopsis would be unfair.As a testament to vagrant, ephemeral human connection, it conveys a bittersweet sort of joy that is rarely seen in conventional movies these days. Writer-director McCarthy (on my most watched list from now on) takes us through this gentle story almost effortlessly, highlighting the little quirks in each character's personality without remotely turning them into offbeat rural stereotypes.The best advice to filmgoers who appreciate smart, mature, humanist movies is, quite simply -- Watch this gem pronto!"	5.0	CHARMING, LEISURELY LITTLE GEM	2004-02-18	31	25	6

It is most definitely not an action film...in fact, not a whole lot happens, plot-wise.  There are laugh-out-loud funny moments, but you can't really say this is a comedy.  I suppose the appeal lies in the fact that the film does a great job of introducing some unique characters, each likable enough so that you find yourself pulling for them as they develop throughout the course of the film.  Add to this some top-notch acting, great scenery, and some wonderfully eccentric supporting characters, and you have yourself a fine film.The DVD extras are not great, but the film is so good it doesn't matter.

Not a comedy. No happy-go-lucky plot this. The guy with the outgoing personality tries to pull the two that are new to town together like he's dying to make a friend and a girlfriend in this small town he's lived in his entire life apparently without either. But how would we know? The character development reveals little of the past of any character. Three stars because I like the actors, and they deliver really good performances considering the script they've got to work with.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A18ONPBXF4XX76	"Stephen J. Heeney ""Filmaddict"""	"A moving,humorous, and never boring slice of life. It has been a long time since I saw a film so well structured and well written. The main protaganist is a man whose past is a veiled mystery and whose current life is opened to the viewer in an unaffecting and honest way. A train ""buff"" who happens to be a dwarf moves to a small deserted railroad depot building he inherits. The Cuban operator of a food vending truck, the emotionally fragile artist(a hilarious first meeting) compromise the main triangle of relationships. This viewer developed an immediate rapport with these three characters. The fact of the main characters dwarfism never seems to bother the small triangle of amity that develops. This film made me want to know all about these characters...to care about them...a rare feat in alot of films these days. I especially liked the Cuban-American young guy who provides so much humor and warmth throughout this film.....he seems like an ordinary working-class guy anyone could be friends with if they tried...perhaps they do not try because of his heritage....how elated he is when Fin(Finbar) moves into the nearby train depot....he works his way into Fins' life in a clever, humorous, and loving way. The character of Olivia...is more complex....an artist seperated from her husband....has a deep emotional hurt inside....waiting for someone to help release it....I am sure she is taken aback at how this emotional burden is somewhat lifted and eased by her two new friends. I laughed and cried and enjoyed myself immensely watching this film. Its subtle touches of humor, the unusual messages of writing on signs in the cameras' view,the addressing of Finbars' dwarfism in both cruel and gentle ways.....Finbars voice....great voice...wonderful actor. I highly recommend this film.....for everyone....some swearing may bother parents of young children..but this is a small masterpiece to be savored."	5.0	The strength in the unlikliest of friendships	2005-06-28	4	4	0

I think I laughed once during this movie and spent the rest of the movie wondering...where are the funny parts? I would consider this a drama - and a very dry one at that.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2QDUGOR9VHE2B	Steve in Gretna	I mainly watched this movie because I enjoy Peter Dinklage in Game of Thrones. He doesn't disappoint in this fine story of a quiet, shy man who just wants to left alone so he can watch and study trains. That's not going to happen due to the people he meets in Newfoundland Pennsylvania; chief among them Joe played by Bobby Cannavale and Olivia played by Patricia Clarkson. They are excellent, especially Cannavale who I think almost steals the movie. However he can't completely steal it because Dinklage displays all of his acting skills in his scenes and he carries the movie. The movie was written and directed by Thomas McCarthy. I recommend it highly.	5.0	An Enjoyable Film.	2014-05-20	0	0	0
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2ARRAMXWT83PT	Steven Adam Renkovish	I just saw a screener of this film the other night, and I have to say, it is one of the best films of the year! I loved it! Peter Dinklage deserved an Oscar nomination, if not the Oscar itself! His performance was so real, and it connected with you on a certain level, and you just knew how this character felt. Everyone else in the cast was awesome as well. Patricia Clarkson was hilarious and moving, as was Bobby Cannavale who plays the extremely hyper and energetic Joe.All in all, I think that Thomas McCarthy has given us a treasure. It's one of those films like LOST IN TRANSLATION, where you just come away from it feeling so effected by it that you want to watch it all over again to get that same feeling. The scenery and use of atmosphere helps to give you the feel of this film, and it will stick with you soon after the film is over. The score by Stephen Trask is also a plus. I loved it, and I hope its on a CD somewhere.Needless to say, I will be buying the DVD as soon as it hits shelves!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	5.0	Wonderful! Dinklage is great!	2004-04-19	12	11	1
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AK61LQI92GTCH	"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH"""	"After his best friend dies a young man inherits a deserted railroad station in rural New Jersey.  Although he makes it abundantly clear he craves isolation, a three-way friendship soon develops between him, a troubled local artist and an outgoing Cuban lunch wagon owner.Peter Dinklage plays the taciturn young man in THE STATION AGENT, a charming, big-splash indy production from 2003.  Bobby Cannavale and Patricia Clarkson form the other sides of the rather unlikely triangle.  Nothing much happens in this movie - Finbar, the Dinklage character, is a train fanatic who wears an old railroad watch and spends many an afternoon watching trains pass by.  Joe (Cannavale) is like a big puppy dog, eager to break through the fence Finbar has build around himself.  Olivia (Clarkson) just happens to, er, run into Finbar a time or two and, like Joe, finds herself drawn to him.THE STATION AGENT is character driven, and the strong performances by the three stars compensate for a lack of plot or major emotional peaks.  There's almost too much subtextual stuff going on here, though.  For instance, Dinklage is a dwarf, or afflicted with dwarfism, or whatever the correct term is nowadays, and I think we're supposed to realize that fact contributed to his decision to turn hermit after his best friend dies.  `I think' is the operative phrase here.  I think the outgoing Joe is attracted to Fin because `there aren't many cool people around.'  I think Olivia... well, I haven't quite figured her out yet, but Clarkson makes of her such an appealing and interesting character, a flighty core personality further distracted by a loss the movie slowly reveals, that I stopped worrying about it.There's a nice commentary track with the three stars and director Thomas McCarthy.  There may be a few too many sentences opening with ""I love it when you did..."" but a tight crew makes good movies, and THE STATION AGENT is a very good movie indeed."	4.0	Welcome aboard	2006-03-26	1	1	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	"Thomas McCarthy's ""The Station Agent"" is proof positive that having appealing characters in a film is not enough to make the film itself appealing.  With nothing happening here to drive events forward, the characters in this production just find themselves adrift in a one-way narrative trip to nowhere.Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) inherits an abandoned train depot and relocates himself there in order to keep some distance between him and the outside world.  Finbar's dwarfism oftentimes attracts unwanted attention but he is able to maintain a sense of comfort in the sanctuary of the train depot.  His isolation, however, proves to be short-lived as Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale), a mobile coffee-cart vendor who does business in front of the depot, develops a friendship with Finbar.  This friendship eventually expands to include a third person as a local artist named Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson) starts to keep company with the two men.""The Station Agent"" succeeds in the task of character development as it creates charming and likeable characters but it fails as a film because it gives these characters nothing to do.  What passes for a story is essentially just a series of small conversations about everyday affairs.  There is an underlying charm in watching Finbar, Joe, and Olivia come together but charm can only take matters so far.  There is no over-arching storyline, there is no journey of self-discovery, and there is no dramatic transformation of any of the characters.  In short, there is nothing present in the story of to give the film any sense of purpose.  Dinklage is wonderful and hopefully other productions will see fit to make better use of his talents.  Cannavale, Clarkson, along with Raven Goodwin and Michelle Williams also do splendid work.  It is just too bad that all of the characters in ""The Station Agent"" were not given more to do."	2.0	"""You timed me?"""	2004-10-09	21	6	15

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A5WLUF4G7W03U	"Swampsprite ""Swampy"""	This story tells of three unlikely friends. Fin, a dwarf who inherits a railroad station, Joe, the Cuban roach coach vendor that parks across the way, and Olivia, the troubled artist that has just come off the loss of a son to Reaper and a husband to divorce.Fin is played intensely and to perfection, and Olivia is a rather daffy artist with very real demons that rend the heart. Joe, however, steals the show. The outgoing one of the bunch, he practically forces the other two into the friendship, and his charisma, kind heart, and spastic personality are a delight to watch. Watch for Bob Cannavale (I think I spelled that last name right) in the future, because he is pretty amazing.From beginning to end, we are invited into Fin's dark world of always being the sideshow, Olivia's tortured mind, and Joe's lonliness and openness. Their interaction is realistically portrayed, the friendships are beautifully drawn for the audience, and even the ending is perfect, because it is what friends do. I will leave it at that, giving this five stars. Worth renting, buying, and watching over and over again.	5.0	A Dwarf, A Cuban, And An Artist	2004-08-13	4	4	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3B9BX6ZL633O9	SwellBooks	"This is truly a wonderful film and easily the best of 2003!Last summer was a pretty dismal one for me, film-wise. It seems I was seeing one bad film after another, culminating in the ghastly ""THE HULK"".Then last fall I saw John Sayles' latest film ""CASA DE LOS BABYS"" and this magical work of art and felt refreshed. These two films convinced me that there were filmmakers out there still interested in telling good stories filled with wonderful and interesting human beings.I won't dwell too much on the story but let you discover it for yourself. Just let me say that its about a young man named Fin who is a dwarf. He has withdrawn from the cruel world that has taunted and mad fun of him all his life and has turned his passion to trains. This film beautifully depicts his meeting with a number of fellow humans also cast adrift and alone in their lives.This is a film you simply must see if you haven't yet. And this DVD presentation is a good place to discover it. The anamorphic widescreen picture is clear and sharp and the soundtrack is quite pleasing to the ear. The extras are a few deleted scenes ( mostly from the films beginning ) and a commentary track with the brillant writer/ director Tom McCarthy and his three leading players, Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale that is not as informative or insightful as one might like. McCarthy did not talk at all about the genesis of the film, where he got the idea, etc. And none of the actors talked about their wonderful characters or what attracted them to the film. Still, it is good to listen to once if only to see this great film again!Today, the word ""masterpiece"" or ""classic"" are thrown around too easily ( it seems every film that comes out is a masterpiece or an instant classic, if you believe the hype ), but this is one film that I can truthfully and with full confidence say is a masterpiece and destined to become a classic!Please, if you haven't seen it, see it, I know that if you love great films, you'll love this! And if you have seen it and love it, you've probably already bought this DVD and don't need my recommendation.

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2GS6XMWDUA4KG	T. Briggs	Some singers are said to be so talented that they could &#8220;sing the phonebook&#8221; and the audience would be mesmerized.  As our screen gem begins we are treated to the exact opposite in which the excitement of a massive billowing steam engine piercing the mountain tunnel is demonstrably rendered less interesting than that of watching Jell-O gel. And we are instantly mesmerized.  Every once in a very rare while a film is birthed onto the internet that while a box office failure ten years ago seems today timeless in its spirit and quirky enough to seem almost real.  In those intersections of the uncomfortable embarrassment of self recognition and the sad enormity of the average life playing out its boring self is the hope that lays silent and buried in every human that you do, in fact, matter in spite of your attempts to pretend you don&#8217;t.  Such is the world of The Station Agent which is cinema speak for Small Stones Make Big Ripples.Some movies have heart; this film has a heart, a soul and a mind and a style that reminds me of a calm surface on a giant sea as the flotsam begins rotating imperceptibly at first and then picks up speed until it becomes a whorl sucking everything into its reality and there you find yourself facing the Kraken of your existence all while smiling.There is no real way to describe this movie because there&#8217;s no way a movie about guys who like trains is really about guys who like trains.  You&#8217;ll have to determine for yourself what this movie is.  What it is not is a waste of your time.  It is also a really really good movie.	5.0	All Aboard	2014-03-28	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1K2ACRU9YJS17	"Tsila Sofer Elguez ""Tsila Sofer Elguez"""	"This is a ""small big movie"" with many nuances, great actors and lovely scenery - all adding up to make this a unique experience. A story of lonely people who find out it is easier to be lonely with other people...The story of Finibar Mcbride (Peter Dinklage), a dwarf, is presented in short scenes, revealing his story without using many words, just bringing small details which make up his life story. One of the opening scenes shows Finn working at the ""Golden Spike"", a train repair store. A child walks in and is surprised to see the short Finn. His surprised reaction is only the first of many reactions to be revealed to the viewers and there comes a point when these reactions are hard on the viewer just as they are on Finn and one can understand his need to build a ""protective shield"" against the world . These reactions also build up our understanding of the bar scene further on through the movie. The store owner, who by small gestures is understood to be protective towards Finn is part of the secluded secure world Finn has created for himself. Not a lot of talk (one of the ""deleted scenes"" shows a lunch scene where each one sits alone and reads his newspaper), mutual love for trains and a regular fixed day pattern. This pattern is shattered when the store owner dies and leaves Finn a train station in the New Jersey rural area. This is the beginning of a new life for Finn who unwillingly finds himself dragged to a new friendship with two characters. Olivia Harris (the great Patricia Clarkson with whom I fell in love in ""Pieces of April""), a woman trying to overcome a loss and Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) a young talkative character whose coffee stand is just near Finn's new house. The building of the relationship and eventually a small change in Finn is brought about by small details and touching moments.My ""movie experience"" was profoundly enriched by the additions part of the DVD which really gives you a better understanding of the movie and the characters. Sort of a further layer of understanding.  I really enjoyed the deleted scenes part, amongst which I would like to mention a scene which is a different ending for the movie. This beautiful scene shows Joe and Olivia sitting reading next to Finn's house (Finn is missing from this scene) and discussing Finn's purchase of a mobile phone and Joe's father which has returned to work. This scene is done in the same style of the real ending scene (giving some optimistic hope for the future) but also showing a glimpse of Olivia's better mental state (she is going to have her brother and his kids for the weekend). These deleted scenes were a real pleasure to watch. Another feature which I immensely enjoyed is a viewing of the movie with the comments of the director and the three main characters. First of all I liked to hear the conversation between the actors and to be a participant to their private jokes . This discussion is especially entertaining as the good chemistry amongst the three is very evident and includes Patricia's clarkson giggles and laughs and a very large part of the internal ""behind the scenes atmosphere"" which I believe is typical of a low budget movie such as this one. The team discusses a lot of ""on the spot"" decisions, changes and additions due to technical problems. It was interesting to hear about the enormous help received from friends (who did their parts for free, so I understand) and to see the point of view of those from within (the director for example was very concerned that the letter received by Finn did not resemble a real bill).  I think I could really understand how the parts were really shaped up by the characters. I was also touched by their comments or silence, such as the director telling us how Patricia Clarkson was glad to end her scenes ""inside the house"", as they were so intense."	5.0	Lovely DVD additions part	2004-11-15	4	3	1

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	Taken out of context, the premise for THE STATION AGENT could be the set-up for a great joke:  a dwarf who used to be a train engineer and worked at a model train store inherits an old train station near Newfoundland, New Jersey and decides to live a life of solitude and makes it his permanent residence but a pesty Cuban hot-dog vendor and a beautiful female artist won't let him live in peace.  It sounds like a comedy, but THE STATION AGENT isn't a comedy.  Instead, it's a smart and slightly quirky drama written and directed by Thomas McCarthy about community and fellowship.Fin McBride is a train lover who works in a model railroad shop in Hoboken, New Jersey.  One day his boss (and only real friend) dies.  In his will he leaves Fin the deed and title to an abandoned train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey.  Fin has had enough of being looked down upon by humanity and decides to begin a new life and moves into the station as his new home.  His desire for solitude is broken soon after arriving by Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) a Cuban-American who's running his father's hot dog while his dad recovers from illness.  Besides Joe, there's also Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson), an eccentric and needy, but beautiful artist who has been separated from her husband ever since the accidental death of their son.  Joe just wants a friend and he really likes the new guy and Olivia just needs the companionship of people in general, feeling that their presence shields her from her own suffering.None of these individuals are perfect, but as the movie progresses we are given a glimpse into the nature of grace and beauty and importance of community.  After hears of being ostracized by most in society, Finn felt he could do life on his own, but he really couldn't.  No man is an island.  Joe is a lonely guy looking for some adventure, a break from the monotony that his duty as a loyal son has brought him and he gains that through his friendship with Fin.  Olivia is a woman with some very deep emotional and psychological problems.  She is afraid to face those problems, but is able to do so through her friendship with Fin and Joe.THE STATION AGENT is a small, brilliant film.  The acting is of Oscar quality (though the movie was largely ignored) and the performances are superb.  After watching the film, one is left with a feeling of longing to have friends such as these.  There's not much of a plot and the movie is more of a snapshot of the lives of these characters upon their first interactions.  The pace of the movie moves along like the third bowl of porridge that Goldilocks tries: not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Not everyone will enjoy watching THE STATION AGENT. It's not a movie that includes lots of action, car chases, explosions, or nudity.  Instead, it is a drama full of characterization and emotion illustrating a deep understanding of what it means to be alive.	5.0	A Dwarf Walks Into a Bar...	2006-09-21	6	5	1
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	AGLL9FGGXRSH7	"T. Williams ""world traveller"""	"It was in my heart to embrace this movie. ""Quirky"" always attracts my attention. I had read the good reviews that hailed it as one of the best movies of the year. I've enjoyed Patricia Clarkson's previous work and have chuckled at Bobby Cannavale in the two or three things I have seen him in. I even passed some time with a student on his way back to Oxford who gushed over this movie.And yet ...The three leads are a compelling bunch. Writer/dirctor Tom McCarthy has gifted actor Peter Dinklage with a wonderful role that was neither sentimental nor condescending. Although the character is a dwarf, with very little tinkering his role could have been played by any actor. Dinklage offers up an ""everyman"" that has either chosen social isolation - or had it thrust upon him.Clarkson's performance is understatedly sexy, simple and selfless (pardon the alliteration). Her grieving artist is so casually presented (no Streep histrionics) that I could not help but feel as though I were observing a friend on home video, rather than watching an ""ACTOR"" crafting a character for the camera. Thus, it was disappointing to see her character do something so theatrical and contrived that it reminded me that I was watching a performance. (I won't even mention the misconceived outburst thrust upon Dinklage's character.)Cannavale is saddled an underwritten role. He is his usual charismatic self, but his character - basically an amiable ""puppy"" yapping at the heels of the two other characters - has no depth for him to explore. While not the most compelling, his character is the most likeable.  (I kept asking myself, what attracts his happy-go-lucky character to these other two wet rags?)These are three charming characters in search of a plotline. There is no story arc for any of the characters. Their motivations are muddled. Nothing happens. There is no resolution - it just stops as though they ran out of film. Admittedly, there are a couple of dramatic events, but they seem more like dramatic devices rather than illumination of the characters. Granted, real life is often full of the meaningless and mundane - but is reading train catalogs enough to propel a movie?The commentary provided by the director and three principals offers the inside scoop on making a low-budget film and is giggly and self-laudatory  enough to reveal that this was a pet project on which all had a good time.I wanted to be ""cool"" enough to love this indy movie - I am just not sure that this movie delivered on its end of the deal. Ultimately I decided to give it four stars rather than three because, even with its limited story appeal, the characters in this movie are more compelling than those who populate movies with 50 times the budget of this thinly-plotted film."	4.0	Parts better than the whole	2006-01-30	4	2	2

Peter Dinklage was incredible, and Cannavale was surprisingly spot-on for his role - although why he is the only listed actor for the movie is a complete mystery. I looked at a lot of reviews and it appears that you will view this movie in relationship to your own life; in other words, you cannot help but project yourself into it and experience it as if it were first-hand. (For instance, some thought the movie mean and some thought it warm and gentle - same movie...) This is one mark of a great movie. Also it is a &#34;I never thought about that&#34; movie in many ways. It is slow-paced but never drags; understated but never obscure. It is a snippet from the lives of some very unique characters; however there is no final resolution to the relationships.Comment on reviews: Amazon usually does an OK job of a capsulized review to qualify the films a little for you. This was one of their worst efforts - I watch on Roku and a review precedes the film - there was NO review, no hint of the subject, tone, setting or anything - they simply listed the actors... completely not helpful; thanks to all the other reviewers for trumping Amazon's attempt.	4.0	short review and comment on reviews	2014-03-11	0	0	0

Kelsey ""seeker of truth"""	"My wife absolutely loves Peter Dinklage, has since having seen him in ""Elf,"" worshiped him in ""Game of Thrones,"" so she was thrilled to see a film in which he was the central actor. However, even for her, this was a let-down. Dinklage is fantastic in every scene, but the plot and other characters just aren't interesting enough to make for a full length film. Joe the Hot Dog vendor is funny and enjoyable to watch, but his character wasn't really believable (others have pointed out the complete lack of profit in selling $1 coffees and hot dogs in an area with what seems to be a population of 20 people). The artist love interest was quite a bit too old for Dinklage unless they were going for a May-December romance which is never addressed. Also, there just didn't seem to be anything extraordinary about her to make Dinklage endure her coldness, abuse, etc., or at least there wasn't for us when we were viewing the film. I think that the actors did the best they could with the script and the pacing, but the film is the classic ""Indie"" type where, while the characters are well crafted, there just isn't that much in terms of plot to hold the viewer's interest. If you are a Dinklage fan, you might want to watch this for no other reason than to enjoy his talent, but if you are looking for more in terms of story and such, you might want to just go and watch ""Game of Thrones.""

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1BSPYNS4225GA	William Martin	This was an low-key train-themed film with an interesting mix of story lines, the majority of which are neither fully developed during the film nor resolved at its low-key end.  It is like a train journey that has no specific destination and on which nothing much happens.  How long does Fin intend to reside in his depot?  Which female relationship (librarian or Olivia) will pan out for him?  Perhaps the producers intended to go further, but ran out of money or script.	4.0	A nice train ride to nowhere	2014-03-16	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1VILVJDOQL4U1	WJS100	Interesting movie about some strange but oddly interesting people. Like most movies set in New Jersey, where I am from, this seems to be a misfit opera about misfit people thrown together by fate and circumstance. Peter Dinklidge succeeds in his portrayal of a reclusive &#34;little person&#34; who is fed up with living as a &#34;curiosity&#34; for most people who see him.	4.0	Small-ish Train Spotter	2014-07-08	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1FT7QFKNHL9DT	Wolfe Moffat	"Remember the part in the movie ""Elf,"" where Buddy the Elf is challenged by a rather small business person, ""CALL me Elf ONE MORE TIME!"" You remember that, right? Of course you do! The man who threw that challenge in the movie ""Elf,"" is Peter Dinklage, and in ""The Station Agent,"" he takes center stage. The story might be quite obvious, yet in the end, there is dignity, respect, and happy tears.Fin is a simple man, he's undersized, and quite frankly, he lives his own life, without a lot of outsiders invading it. When his best friend and boss/co-worker suddenly passes away, Fin is given a gift.You see, Fin does have a passion for trains, and his buddy gives him a train station that is in the middle of nowhere. That's perfect, because that means no company whatsoever, no people, no distractions, just Fin and himself. Right? Well, um, not exactly. Fin soon discovers that he has the most unexpected company that he couldn't possibly want to deal with! This was supposed to be his quiet time, and he's being disturbed with all these stupid people! Or are they stupid people? Fin soon discovers, despite his insecurity and vulnerability towards the rest of the human race, that there are people out there who have their hurts and challenges in life as well.This is so incredible, yet it is so simple. Have we forgotten how to treat people? Some of us have, and it really pisses me off sometimes! We treat people like garbage when they don't fit our standards, and we point fingers. This says you can learn to love again, and learn to put up with certain annoyances. And it packs a punch with such dignity, it'll blow your mind! If not? I guess I wouldn't expect that from everybody. But I loved it!"	5.0	Being Human, Treating Others How You'd Want To Be Treated, And With Dignity!	2012-04-06	4	4	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A2K7AGFMLCHFLJ	W. Zeranski	"This guy, Fin [Finbar McBride], who is a dwarf, is also a misanthrope, his physical appearance having everything to do with his desire for a solitary life.  He's also a train buff or rather fanatic.  Among train lovers, he's just like everyone else.  He inherits a train station, and goes there to live alone, and to be left alone, and peruse his train enthusiasm to the fullest, alone.Well, two people enter his life:  One is Joe, a young man of Cuban extraction, taking care of his father's caf&eacute; on wheels business [a van].  He latches onto Fin to relieve his own loneliness. The other is Olivia, a woman failing to deal with death of her boy and is now estranged from her husband.  Oh, she almost runs Fin over while he's walking to the local store, and then again, when he's headed back.  What a way to begin life in a new home, right?So, emotional wreckage and a quest for companionship are forced into Fin's life.  ""The Station Agent"" offers humor, tragedy, fulfillment and love when all a guy wanted was to be left alone."	5.0	Emotional wreckage and companionship	2009-04-20	2	2	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	APIO48NCOAFFI	yogatorrie	I can't say enough good stuff about my experience watching this movie. The setting (small town in New Jersey in late Spring?) felt like I could step into it, it felt that realistic . The characters were like you and me and people you'd encounter in real life as opposed to what movies and T.V. usually presents. There is a place of course for the usual run of the mill movie idea of people and relationships and then there is something better. This movie is the latter.The friendships developed naturally albeit begrudgingly and I'm glad that they did so. I was cheering inwardly for these characters to become friends.Their friendships took some rough turns and there were moments when I thought tragedy would strike.No spoilers here, the ending was satisfying,WATCH THIS FILM!!!	5.0	I'll watch this movie again	2014-03-18	0	0	0
B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1XOUJZ1IZCXU4	Yongyi Wu	It's a nice-shot movie, the story is well-developed and the scene is beautiful, logical and not awkward at all. The director is a good director I think. However, the story is kind of boring. I am not quite sure what the story is trying to convey, love? friendship? the miserable life as being a dwarf? It seems like there is not such a single point that the story is trying to emphasize. throughout the entire movie, I can feel loneliness deep in each character's soul. Olivia, a divorced lady living alone; Joe, a talkative guy actively trying to make friend with Fin ( probably Fin is the only one he can talk to); Fin, a reserved guy who is the best friend with loneliness. Unlike some metropolis cities like New York, they are ordinary people living in a small town, I can imagine and understand how peaceful and serene the life would be there, though I would definitely feel lonely as a 20+ girl from a crowded big city in China. If I watched this movie when I was still in China, I would definitely be looking forward to the peaceful and wonderful life there in the movie. However, after I have been in the State for almost a year, I feel loneliness in this movie above all other feelings.	4.0	Loneliness in every-minute of this movie	2014-05-27	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A1S1BJFTA644TU	Zalmorion the Fantastic	This movie is slow, but not boring.  It is an interesting and touching character study come to life.  The lives of three special people converge onto one another.  We get to witness the development of relationships, the beauty and frailty of humanity, and come away with a few life lessons.  Lessons gleaned by watching these masterful actors play out an excellent story.  Not forced morals or ham-handed beliefs shoved onto us.  Instead, you pull meaning into your own life after watching this film.  The way you do after finishing a well-written novel.Worth watching.  It is a thoughtful piece that entertains you at the pace of a leisurely drive.  Masterful in every way.  Cannot cast better actors than these.I wish we had more films like this.	5.0	Touching, Subtle, Thoughtful	2014-06-11	0	0	0

B0001WTWDI	The Station Agent	A3ADK3ZTJ87915	"Zinta Aistars ""Writer & Editor"""	This may well be my second favorite movie ever. Certainly in the top five. Can I explain why? I'm not sure that I can. An attempt: it appeals to the small person inside every single one of us. The one that never quite fits. The one that takes a beating and keeps on ticking. The one that lies down under a train and fails even at that. The one that paints half finished children for the eternal loss that never heals. The one that keeps on knocking until the door finally opens. The one that drinks alone at the end of the bar. The one that dreams of riding the Zephyr and hopes it never reaches the end of the line. The one that sits among other small big people and feels right at home.	5.0	You know who you are...	2008-03-23	22	19	3
