6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A31Z82XDWWWRIU	A 12-year old viewer	My favorite book and one of my favorite movies, this compelling and wonderful story will twist your heart beyondrepare. The characters are so real. Scarlett and Rhett are the most amusing people you can ever hope to meet with so much life(selfconceaded). And Melanie, so kind and trustworthy.And Ashley depenible (though weak).And you cant forget Mammy strongand stoborn.The acting is wonderful with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett,Clark Gable as Rhett Butler ( and in my opinion should have wonthe best actor award).Olivia de Haviland is excellent as Melanieand Hattie McDaniel as Mammy. And well, if you have not seen this filmyou've never lived.	5.0	Simply the BEST	2001-09-15	2	1	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1HN0SOEDNWHBY	Abhishek Shah	"Gone With the Wind beautifully depicts the south during the Civil War and the Reconstruction era, but through its own ""Rose - Colored Glasses."" This is to say that the movie completely ignores the poor classes discontent  before the war, thus only focusing on the rich planter aristocracy. It also  gives a very optimistic view of slave life during and after the civil war.  The movie was released in 1939, during the heart of FDR's New Deal and the  beginning of WWII (and the US's nonintervention policies). Many aspects of  the movie are related to a certain extent to these policies in the movie.  The movie begins with a post Civil War society that lived in lavish  plantations. The barbecue at ""Twelve Oaks"" shows southern arrogance when  they are talking about the upcoming war with the then hated Yankees. They  claimed that they can easily defeat the Yankees in a matter of days (It  takes one southern planter to lynch ten Yankees). As the men are smoking  their cigars and drinking their brandies, they claim their jubilant ideas  and plans about the war. In fact, only the rich aristocrats were happy  towards the upcoming war, while the small (poor) farmers were glad to get  the slave capital off the hands of the aristocrats (since they could not  afford it themselves). Most poor farmers welcomed the Union army, and were  thus called ""scalawags."" This fact is almost erased from the movie. When  the war is declared, all the aristocrats (young) rush off to enlist for the  ""southern cause."" While in reality, most aristocrats paid poor farmers to  go and fight in their place, or to pay some three hundred dollars so that  they could be excused from the war. And since most southerners (poor,  especially the poor immigrants) didn't fight for the war, the Confederate  army was severely handicapped. Although the movie nicely depicts the  southern attitudes to wards the war. The movie also shows an optimistic  view of southern attitude towards the blacks (not only the house slaves,  but also the field slaves as well). In the movie the blacks are actually  happy with their white masters. In one jocular scene, a slave yells ""Quit'n  Time,"" instead of a white master. In another scene, Ashley remarks that one  should not treat a person so harshly (the people were tied to chains and  forced to work), while he had some slaves himself. Even Scarlett remembers  the names of all her former slaves.Once the Confederates loose the  war, the soldiers return home. Only to find harsh realities imposed by the  black rule (although implicitly stated by the movie), Scalawags, and the  Carpetbaggers. The black rule in the post Civil War is demonstrated by the  blacks freedom in the streets, and one ex-slave who is riding a carriage,  while other ex- confederate soldiers (whites) are walking. In one scene,  the streets of Atlanta are filled with freed slaves, talking, playing  music, and poking fun of different things. The Scalawags also imposed a  $300 tax on the Tara plantation (Scarlett's plantation). This only  demonstrates the brutality imposed by pro-northern people. With lack of  money, people are reduced to work in harsh conditions, and hardly getting  enough to sustain their family. In one dramatic scene, Scarlett finds her  plantation completely ruined by Union army soldiers. When she is going  around her plantation, she finds a carrot still in the ground. She gets  down as says one of her favorite lines, ""God as my witness, I shall never  go hungry again."" This demonstrates the brutality that the southerners had  to go through during the early Reconstruction days. Although, some of the  white's brutalities over the blacks start to appear, when Scarlett's is  attacked by a band of scalawags. Promptly, her second husband, Kennedy,  goes to a ""political meeting."" We can deduce that this political meeting is  an early form of the KKK, since most blacks were hatted getting superior  posts in government jobs during the military rule. But once Scarlett  marries Rhett Butler, most of the Reconstruction hustle disappears, since  they live in elegant homes and style. From this point on, most of the  historical value of the movie is lost. From this point on, it's a movie of  drama, love, rumors, and trust.  This does not only have a great deal  of historical significance, but it also gives important information about  the time when this movie was released (1939). The war (WWII) had already  started in Europe, but FDR proclaimed the Neutrality Proclamations (a  series of four proclamations). As each proclamation was issued, the country  drifted more into the war tangle. This movie strikingly demonstrates the  brutality of war, and thus it is clearly nonintervention propaganda. The  brutalities of war are also demonstrated by the recent Depression of the  1930's. As FDR's New Deal drifted the country back into progress, and with  the new war in Europe, Gone With The Wind, demonstrates a nonintervention  policy would benefit all."	5.0	Mamamia	2000-06-07	9	3	6
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AACV8ZQ54AY19	"A. Book Attict ""bibliophile"""	Because I'd heard nothing but great things about &quot;Gone with the Wind,&quot; the &quot;greatest love story/movie of all time.&quot; I'd watched it recently and saw hardly any redeeming qualities amongst the mediocrity...and I wrote this review. The following was the original, rated 3/5 stars.&quot;I've heard for my whole life that the tale of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara was a heart-wrenching love story between two charismatic leads, Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. In truth, they weren't even in love. At all. Scarlett's affections belonged to another man, and she didn't realize she just MIGHT have feelings for Rhett until the very end.&quot;Scarlett O'Hara was one of the most detestable characters I have ever watched onscreen. She was bitter, cold, and cared only for herself and money. And while she was surrounded by wonderful people (Olivia de Havilland's TERRIFIC portrayal of Mellie, and, of course, Rhett Butler), they had no effect on her; their kindness was unappreciated and unmatched.&quot;Historically, the film was quite accurate (except that slaves were usually treated horribly in the 1800s), and the war scenes sent chills down my spine--the wounded soldiers, screaming for painkillers, screeching in agony as limbs were amputated with no anesthetic.&quot;The first half of the movie was very well-done, and I actually LIKED Scarlett before watching the conclusion. However, the second half was unnecessary and focused only on the petty affairs of Scarlett and Rhett and their daughter. I don't understand why this film was so hyped up--and still is--but I suppose I must be missing something. Before you hit the &quot;no&quot; button below &quot;was this review helpful to you?&quot; remember that I am only 13, and I will definitely rewatch the film when I'm older, as I'm almost positive I'll like it better then.&quot;GwtW--the best film of all time? No, not in my opinion. But decide for yourself.&quot;Okay. In the days that followed this review, I thought about the movie. I thought and thought and finally came to a conclusion--it really WAS a great movie. I have no idea why I didn't like it at first, because, on rewatching, I LOVED it.Scarlett was not so detestable after all--I realized that she just really, REALLY didn't want to experience once again the hunger that had once taken over her body. She was naive and thought she was in love with Ashley Wilkes, the husband of Mellie, until the end, when she finally realized that she DID love Rhett Butler himself...and I really felt for her.A timeless story and a great movie that I will hopefully soon be adding to my video collection, GONE WITH THE WIND is a cinematic masterpiece on nearly every level. If you don't like it at first, perhaps you'll be like me and Scarlett and have a change of heart. ;)	5.0	I must have been missing something...	2001-08-05	26	17	9

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1X8HU2B2OAPS1	"A. Chrisope ""Mr Brightside"""	"I'm a big film buff; I can assure you this is NOT the greatest movie ever made.  Overblown and overly long (even the opening credits last longer than they should!), engrossed with its own sense of enormity, not exactly true to history (""See? the slaves were actually happy!""), and much of the acting and dialogue feels dated.  But the worst aspect of this film has to be the shrill, unattractive Scarlett O'Hara.  I'm not criticizing Vivien Leigh's performance, and she is a very beautiful woman; it's just impossible to get into the movie when the protagonist is so unsympathetic and inexplicably drawn to the total cad Ashley.  I give it 2 stars; one for its importance in the history of filmmaking, and one for the hilarious and touching performance by Clark Gable, perhaps the only reason to view this film more than once.  If you really want the greatest film ever made, try Casablanca or Citizen Kane; and if you just can't live without color and BIG production values, try the much more inventive and charming The Wizard of Oz."	2.0	Most Overrated Hollywood Film	2005-02-20	39	6	33
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2YWR4BT2249LT	A Classic Movies Fan	I saw Gone With The Wind twice when it was re-released in the summer of 1998. Although fifty-nine years have passed, the movie is still being enjoyed by the old and young alike. I enjoyed every minute of the movie and  there are so many scenes that will touch your heart. The cast was well  chosen and every accolade bestowed on this movie proves that Gone With The  Wind is indeed an outstanding picture.	5.0	A Timeless Classic	1999-10-22	5	3	2
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1VQBHHXIKHIGS	A Customer	It opens by telling us that the South exists no more, except in books. I believe this particular version of the South never existed at all except in this book. But even so, it's more watchable than I expected. It may be idealistic and melodramatic, but I'm still glad I've seen it. Does anybody remember that, in this movie, Jesus took a bullet? Rhett Butler's a great character, plus that's Clark Gable. But Vivian Leigh also did a great job with the growth of Scarlett O'Hara. A little bit of Mitchell's actual prose made its way onto the screen, leading me to believe it's every bit as syrupy and unreadable as most folks who have read it claim. Apologies to those who think it's the greatest book and/or movie of all time, but I'm not one of you. However, at the end of this four-hour epic, when Rhett Butler walked out, I was sad. It is moving. I think she'll get him back. What about you? After all, tomorrow is another day.	3.0	Better Than Expected	2008-02-07	3	0	3

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2S166WSCFIFP5	"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com"""	1939 is often called Hollywood's Golden Year, and with movies like The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, it is no wonder. GWTW is based on Margaret Mitchell's book of the same title. This movie has stellar performances by Clark Gable (who plays a scoundrel the way no other actor can) and Vivien Leigh (who plays a strong women in a time when strong women were not admired). The other actors put on a great performance also. This movie is epic in nature. It is an epic tale, with huge epic sets. There is love, loss, betrayal, war, and beauty, all contained within. It is also the top grossing movie of all time (after adjusting for inflation) and one of the most popular movies of all time. Admittedly it is a long movie, but it is so well done that the four hours pass quickly.  The movie is full of memorable lines and unforgettable characters. And it is a bit risque for the time. There are some questionable treatments of race, but you have to remember the movie takes place during the Civil War and was made in the 30s.The dvd is a disappointment. It's in a cheap snap case. This edition is not in letterbox, truly a travesty for the type of film it is. A movie this grand should be in letterbox. I wouldn't say that the sound and picture quality is the best, the sound, for some reason, is especially lacking. There are virtually no extra features. Only the trailer and some trivia. And the movie is on both sides of the disk. I'd rather have had a two disc set. There is no commentary (and Olivia de Havilland is still alive), not even by a critic or historian (like Citizen Kane). No documentary. And the original release contained an extra 48 minutes, which should have been on the dvd under deleted scenes. I hope that eventually there will be a special edition that does this movie justice. It's epic, grand, on the AFI's top 100, and won 10 academy awards. Eventually Warner Bros will release an edition that is worthy of the film (as a dvd I would only give it one or two stars, but because it is such a great movie, I can't give it less than five stars, even if the dvd is lacking).Along with Casablanca and Titanic, this is the best love story told. It is a great love story (none of the best love stories have a happy ending) and one of the best films ever made.	5.0	a grand movie	2002-09-16	8	3	5

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3IAP2JMTP5YBN	"adriana ""alisa"""	Gone With The Wind is one of my favorite films OF ALL TIME. No matter how many times I watch it, I find myself engulfed,overwhelmed,moved to tears, chilled to the bone, and amazed at the pure marvelousness of the entire thing.EVERY FREAKING TIME.The acting is BRILLIANT from absolutely everyone.That's right, not a single performance is anything less than awe-inspiring.From Vivian Leigh as fearless and strong-willed Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara, to Clark Gable(WHY DIDN'T HE WIN THE OSCAR???????!!!?????) as the ultimate &quot;non-gentleman&quot; Rhett Butler, to Leslie Howard as the gentle,but slightly weak-minded Ashley Wilkes, to Olivia De Havilland as the deeply humane, and physically weak Melanie Hamilton.And, who could forget Hattie McDaniel as the feisty Mammie?THIS IS SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST CASTS OF ALL TIME, OR DAY I SAY THE BEST????Every performance, is, I repeat, a testament to the power of acting.The dialogue is so damn good every time-and every scene stands out in my mind as a piece of cinematic history.And to those idiots who think that Scarlett O'Hara was a &quot;bad,selfish&quot; person, I could just spit on you.Here is a woman who had enough spirit and bravery to go against a society of pampered Southerners, a woman who fought with her sweat and blood to keep her family's plantation, a woman who rose after every war, ever obstacle, a woman who waded through burning cannons with a pregnant woman and a baby on her own-and you call her a bad person? Maybe she was selfish, but perhaps it was this selfishness that let her see that the important things in life weren't a good repuatation, or nice hands, but honor, and family, and the well-being of loved ones. She might have acted like a spoiled brat, but her fearless actions contradicted whatever egotism she may've shown through her words.I don't care who you are, where you're from, if your favorite movie is the matrix, I DONT CARE, this is a film that, if there ever was one, can be loved by ever single living and breathing soul.In this three hours lies a treat drenched in truth about the (corny as this may sound, its true!) endurance of the human spirit, the ties which bind human beings,and simply life-what it can bring, what it can take away, and what it can retain.Watch this absolutely timeless masterwork and relish in the power of the incredible acting, the brilliance of the dialogue,each and every scene which results in a film which is by turns witty, smart,weary, romantic, tragic,epic-ally moving and spine chilling.Brilliant beyond all words-and an asbolute masterwork which has already gone down, and will continue being known as one of the cinema's greatest pieces of art.	5.0	THE EPIC OF ALL EPICS	2004-06-13	9	7	2
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3O010C6Q5VSZU	Adrian	I agree with &quot;Simply A Classic&quot; review. Gone With the Wind does ignore the brutality of slavery and focuses on a romanticized view of slave life by &quot;staying away from unnecessary words or insinuations.&quot; However, as &quot;Simply&quot; points out this movie was released in 1939, and at that time probably no movies addressed race and slavery realistically. Unfortunately, the romanticized view of slavery presented by GWTW influences our cultural memory of slavery and may negate the truth in, I believe, more realistic and culturally valuble narratives, like the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass.	3.0	A review of Gone With the Wind	2001-11-19	3	0	3

Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, and she is the only actress that could play this part, she was one of the most gorgeous women of her time. Clark Gable is not too shabby himself, he is near perfect as Rhett Butler. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett is red hot, and when they get snippy with each other, they sizzle with hatred and smoldering intensity. This is one film everyone and I MEAN everyone must see in his or her lifetime. The score is dramatic and full of life, the acting is absolutely astounding, and the story is pure magic.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"While most will argue with me, I must begin by saying that I was not impressed with the overall final results of this ""epic"".  The hype surrounding it, the overuse of Rhett's infamous line in pop culture, and the fact that most people rave about this being one of the most romantic films ever produced set my standards extremely high.  I wanted to be blown away by the scenes, I wanted characters that would invite me into their worlds and never make me leave, I wanted tragedy on a grand scale, but alas, that wasn't what I witnessed with Gone with the Wind.  Somehow I ending this film with a sense of astonishment, a sense of being robbed, and not at all the romantic film I thought I would be enjoying.  Instead I saw hatred, sexism, racism, alcoholism, anti-love, pro-Confederacy, and ignorance all rolled up together into a two-disc packaging, which would be later called Gone with the Wind.  It was embarrassing to watch and call as one of our ""greatest love stories ever"".  While it may show us what society was like during a pre-Civil War era, that doesn't mean we have to condone it and embrace it.I realize that the point of this film was to show us a different side of the war.  That all Southerners were not fueled by hatred and surrounded by a violent slavery system.  Instead, there was quite a bit of beauty to the old South.  A sense of pride, a sense of gentlemanly nature, and a sense of honor, which was difficult to witness being trampled on as the North continued its destructive war path.  In that sense, I think it gave us a glimpse of what we lost with the Civil War.  That image of the South was beautifully captured in this film.  This film gives us some of the most beautiful sights of lavish plantations, beautiful greens, and civilized parties.  The technical aspects of this film are astonishing.  While I will agree with most that a widescreen version of this film may have swayed me to giving it one more star, the full screen still demonstrated the amazing sights of the South.  The wide shots of the mansions, the bustling Atlanta area, and terror/tragedy of war was beautifully captured in this film.  For that, I cannot fault this film, but what I can fault it for are the stereotypes, the shallow characters, and the faded ending that just didn't seem to match the overall tone of the film.To begin, the stereotypes.  While most will say that the stereotypes in this film accurately depict the voice of the South, I just didn't feel comfortable watching it in today's society.  I realize that this was made back in 1938, but I still didn't feel comfortable with slavery, sexism, and ignorance surrounding these characters.  Does that make this film dated?  Perhaps if I witnessed our characters going through some form of change I would have softened a bit, but I did not see that at all.  With the continual struggles that minorities have in cinema today, is it wise to continue to think of this film as a masterpiece of cinema?  Is it worth of all the accolades that it received?  No.  In fact, I am surprised that this film hasn't been shunned by a majority of communities during each release.  This is a pinnacle example of what obstacles African Americans are trying to overcome in today's Hollywood.There are those that speak so highly of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh's chemistry, but for me, it was non-existent.  I did not see why there are those that fall over this film and praise the story.  I thought that Leigh was horrid as the early Southerner turned feminist.  Gable was so inconsistent with his character that I didn't know whether to love him or hate him.  There was no chemistry or connection between Leigh and Gable.  They were together because the director (which this film eventually went through three of them) knew that audiences would want to see them either together or going to get together by the end.  The rest of it was just trivial.  With the fuzzy direction of Leigh's character, you never quite felt that Scarlett had an ounce of passion in her heart.  She wanted what she couldn't have, like a spoiled child, and that was reflected again with the inconsistent ending.  Gable's character of Rhett was underdeveloped.  We knew nothing about this man except that he randomly continued to jump in and out of Scarlett's life.  Where did his wealth come from?  What was his past?  Who knows ... and none of it was fully explained.  This can be said the same with Ashley.  Who was this guy?  Why did Scarlett choose him over the other possible suitors?  Was it simply because she couldn't have him, or because of some darker reason?  Did anyone else notice that she was Irish, not quite the Southern belle that we had originally hoped for?  Overall, these characters hurt and built upon the ultimate downfall of this film.  They were forgettable from the first time that we met them until the very end of the film.  Underdeveloped, unintelligent, and downright dull.  All elements that gave us too long of a film centered on nothing.Overall, I just didn't see what all the hype was surrounding this film.  Our society has moved forward from this period, but do we need to be reminded of it continually by giving this film more and more accolades?  I don't think so.  I do not wish to see this film again and hope that it does not continue to be a staple of our cinematic society.

I immediately also played my 4-disc Collector's edition and immediately saw that it's much clearer and had a much better image. It was a joy to see it once more. This is not the first time for me that a DVD gives a much better image than the Blu-Ray of the same movie. I do have Blu-Ray's that give a very good image butI will never part from my DVD's because in some cases the DVD is of a far better quality. I just can't understand why Warner Home Video can't do it better, they must see which one is the better image."	5.0	DVD far better than Blu-Ray	2012-02-12	11	5	6

Everything is perfect here, there is action, suspense, joy, sorrow and mighty fine acting from an all star cast.Don't make the same mistake I did if you haven't seen it, I don't have to go on about it to those who have as I'm sure they like myself already have it on DVD or Blu-Ray in their collection.You do don't you?	5.0	Grand Entertainment That's Watchable Anytime.	2011-05-09	2	2	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2QASAMGT1UYZ3	Alexis_Ray	"*****5 stars for the filmThe setting is a Georgia plantation. The year is 1861, and sixteen-year-old Scarlett O'Hara is infatuated with the blond, drowsy-eyed Ashley Wilkes - the problem is, Ashley plans to marry another woman. Little matter that every other man in the county is courting Scarlett and that a charming scoundrel named Rhett Butler is staring at her with questionable intent - she cares only for Ashley.Suddenly, the Civil War brakes out, changing the fates and fortunes of all. Scarlett, clever, manipulative and charming, proves an adept survivor - but what will she have to do to survive? And will she ever learn whom it is that she really loves?GWTW is one of the most meticulously cast films ever, with everyone from the leads to the character actors turning in near-flawless performances. After you watch Vivien Leigh you will be unable to imagine anyone else playing Scarlett, and Hattie McDaniel's strong, unforgettable performance as ""Mammy"" netted her an academy award (the first for an African-American actor).The cinematography is beautiful. Gone With the Wind was shot entirely in technicolor; the scene of the fire in Atlanta required the use of all eight technicolor cameras in existence at the time!The one unsettling aspect of this film is the way slavery is depicted. Though Scarlett is shown striking a slave in one scene, in general GWTW provides an unbalanced & far too rosy view of what life was like for African-Americans at that time. Part of this may be inheritent to the film's structure - we're in Scarlett's point of view - but a disservice is done to history and people who suffered whenever slavery isn't depicted as the atrocity it was.GWTW's backdrop is the gruesome Civil War, and in the end this is the story a woman and a civilization (the Old South) going through a war that will not leave either of them unchanged.***3 stars (for the *single-disc*) DVD editionPicture and sound quality are very good.Special Features: English & French subtitles and a theatrical trailer. That's it. Despite the film's age, there's really no excuse for this. In 1989, a wonderful two-hour documentary entitled  ""The Making of a Legend: Gone with the Wind"" was produced by Daniel and L. Jeffrey Selznick (David O. Selznick's sons) that featured archive footage, screen tests, interviews & much more. We deserve a DVD edition that includes it.Packaging: The artwork is printed on cardboard which forms the front of the DVD case; it snaps shut from the side. This makes it slightly less durable than a regular DVD snap case and since the cover art isn't in protective plastic, it's easier to wear/mar.I went ahead and bought this DVD because I wanted GWTW in my collection. If you don't care about special features, you'll probably be satisfied with this disc. However, if they're important to you, you may want to wait and hope Warner Brothers releases an edition more worthy of this classic."	5.0	An Enduring Classic	2004-08-18	6	5	1
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	There are some films movielovers everywhere have to watch ( I myself have a small list of films on amazon). On that list goes &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot; Psycho&quot;, and without any doubt &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;. For years, after claiming to be a filmlover, I never saw this movie and felt ever so stupid for not seeing it. How can you say you love movies and not see &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;? It just can't be possible! So, I finally said to myself, it's time to see this movie. It, now in my opinion, is one of the greatest films I've ever seen! Directed by Victor Fleming and based on the book by Margaret Mitchell this film has everything going for it. I can't commemt on the screenplay by Sidney Howard, I don't know if he stayed true to the book, since I've never read the book. Hey, I just saw the movie not too long ago, give me time! lol. What I can commemt on is the acting. It gave Gable and Leigh roles they have been forever remembered for, Rhett Butler and Scarlett O' Hara. Leslie Hoard ( Ashley), Olivia de Havilland (Melanie) and Hattie McDaniel (Mammy) are all wonderful themselves in their respective roles. One of the &quot;test&quot; all movies must go through to be considered &quot;classic's&quot; are do they still seem fresh and new to the viewer as time passes by. Does &quot;The Godfather&quot; still hold your attention after over 25 years? Do you still find yourself hoping that things between Scarlett and Rhett will work out in the end? That they can somehow meet at some level? If so, I feel a movie has proven it is a classic. And GWTW does that. It's a movie that is warm, tender, amusing, and overall just enjoyable! I have nothing but great and wonderful things to say about this movie, but I'm sure a review just using wonderful adjectives to describe a movie will be boring. So, in order to save myself from such a thing I will just say everyone HAS to see this movie!	5.0	A Grand Epic!	2001-03-21	12	10	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AOEFE93XSDHRM	Alicia Zieman	"I think it is a great movie. It is prefect for history fans. It is one of my favorites movies. It is set in the Civil War era.It is about the love of Scalett O'Hara (Vivian Leigh) and Rhett Bulter (Clark Gable).Scallet is very independent, emerald-eyed women, who first gets married to Charles Hamiltion. He's sister is Melanie, who becomes the wife of Ashley, the man, Scarlett wants, buts, can never have. Then she keeps her family together,--anyway she could. She even killed a Yankee.Then she marrys Frank Kenndy, who she steals from her sister, Sulene. She only marrys him to pay the taxes on Tara. The house she lives in, and loves. He dies while having to get revenge for her.She then marrys her third, and last husband, Rhett. They have a fiery romance. They have a daughter, that Rhett names Bonnie Blue Butler, because her eyes were as blue as the Bonnie Blue Flag. Bonnie dies, because she trys jumping a feence, with her pony, and flips over it.There are some famous lines in this book. Such as when Scarlett says, ""Oh, Rhett, where will I go? What should I do?"" He says, ""Frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn."" Or well Melanie in labor, amd Prissy says, ""Miss Scarlett, I don't nothin' about birthin' no babies.""The most famous line, is at the end of the movie, when Scarlett says, ""I won't think about that now. I'll think about that tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day!"""	5.0	Gone With My Heart	2003-09-03	1	1	0

This is as close to a perfect movie as you can get. It is obvious why Vivien  Leigh and Hattie McDaniel won  Oscars, as they stand out in a cast of other  wonderful stars.  Do you recognize the 1950's Superman, George Reeves, as  one of the Tarlton twins in the opening sequence?  Of course, it helped  tremendously that GWTW was adapted from a superior novel, and that David O.  Selznick didn't know the meaning of the word &quot;compromise.&quot;  I  must give this movie my highest recommendation.	5.0	Best Movie of All Time	1999-06-11	2	0	2
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1BRQCMDHYX3Z4	Allan Dye	I am not a literature guru but I recently saw gone with the wind for the first time after hearing all my life how great it was and how people go on and on about Scarlet O'Hara.  Scarlet is a conniving, selfish, petty, rich kid that despite her numerous chances to grow a conscience never did.  She is infatuated with a married man like a squealing schoolgirl and tries to make him jealous all the time.  For some bizarre reason she married a man that she had utter contempt for and then mourned his death in the war for about 5 minutes.  She later steals her sister's true love by lying to get his money (she had already tried this with Rhett but had failed).  Why did she need money...to save her precious real estate.  It seemed that Rhett was as slimy as she was so when they finally married it seemed like a match made in Vegas.  Rhett started to develop some character, however, and actually passed her on the morality interstate so that she was now the lowest one in the movie.  She never got Ashley even after repeatedly trying to seduce him.  She also was constantly stabbing his wife Melanie, who thinks Scarlet is her best friend, in the back.  It's hard for Melanie to see the deception since she is busy helping injured soldiers at the hospital.  Melanie is the most noble character in the movie and the only reason I gave it 2 stars.

Image is only marginally sharper (very marginally!) then DVD, and dimmer (and I though HD suppose to make film look brighter!)! My GWTW 4 disc DVD Collection Edition actually appeared brighter! Grain is also more obvious due to HD.I should have expected this, as there is only so much WB could do to the 70 years old source material. No matter 4K or 8K remastered, the image is always going to be soft and grain is going to be obvious.Stick to your DVD unless you haven't get it yet (Most already have 4 or 5 versions!)! Otherwise don't waste your money, or better still, get the DVD!

I'm only a teen but I've read the book 3 times, seen the movie quite a few, and absolutely love both! Vivien Leigh is such a perfect Scarlett, and Clark Gable is such a handsome, detestable Rhett that its uncanny! Mitchell couldn't have dreamed up any two people better suited for the lead roles!Although the movie leaves out a few things (the births of Scarlett's 2 other children, Wade and Ella, for example) it is still the best movie-based-on-a-book ever, and even without the book it would have been the best movie ever!

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AIBOT8PYNXFQX	"""allthegoodnames"""	"""Gone with the Wind,"" starring Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable is perfect as Rhett Butler. ""Gone with the Wind"" is one of the greatest movies ever, for obvious reasons, and you'll probably agree by the ending. The acting is excellent, Vivian Leigh's performance as Scarlett O'Hara is masterful at best, and Clark Gable is perfect as Rhett Butler. The scenery in the movie along with the cinematography makes for a lush and beautiful set and candy for the eye. The script was taken from the novel of the same name and is easily top notch.One of my favorite parts of the movie was the ending. Rhett Butler is leaving and says the semi-famous line,""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn."" When he leaves, Scarlett falls to the steps and this is where one of my favorite lines in movie history is said(you'll have to see for yourself). After this line your heart will break like Scarlett's when you see Rhett walk off into the distance. The ending is also one of the best I've seen, and one of my favorites. By the time the Exit Music starts, I was left in my seat feeling that I had just watched something very special, and asked myself why I ever hesitated to watch it in the past.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A20VXYT5DL0ZC6	"Amazon Customer ""Creator, Entrepreneur, Free ..."	"They just don't make movies like this anymore...While my contemporaries feast over low-grade bad films as par for the course, and the new Hollywood is all too willing to supply those mediocrities; and the media go ga-ga and proclaim a film like Titanic ""the greatest blockbuster of all time"", we all know that Gone With the Wind is the greatest ticket seller and popular film in history by far, and it and other films like it set the standard by which movie excellence will always be judged. And not for nothing. What else can you say about Gone With the Wind, a lavish and stunning artistic production which features even special effects that are superior to most current Hollywood fare in their degree of dramatic effect? More importantly, you have a timeless story of love and survival in the midst of war, in a time when men were still men, and ladies were ladies. I went to see GWTW with my mother in the early 1990's in the theaters during one of its many revivals. And to think that she herself went to the movie as a young girl, having been born in the very year it was released, 1939. It's one of her favorites, and one of mine, now. Now that I watch it again, as a more seasoned individual, I can really appreciate the story's depth, and the sheer quality of the film and its featured acting. Vivian Leigh as Scarlett, the spoiled and impetuous girl who doesn't know who she really loves, and doesn't know what's really good for her, but has the tenacity and survival instincts of a jungle cat. Ashley Wilkes, the soft-spoken gentleman who always does ""the right thing"", but still screws things up (aren't we all familiar with that circumstance?); Malanie, his angelic wife, always faithful, who watches over everyone and never thinks badly of Scarlett. And Rhett Butler....what a man. A scoundrel. A gambler. A smuggler. A dastardly charmer. Selfish. Tough. Independent. Dashing. And smart enough not to go joining another foolish and wasteful war, as he terms it. Oh, how we need more men like Rhett nowadays. And isn't he just perfect for Scarlett, as though they were made for each other!What about the sheer audacity of the screeplay. You'd never find Hollywood's politically-correct producers fashioning such a movie these days--they'd probably be denounced...for including scenes like the chicken getting chased with an axe to be butchered for dinner...for showing a balanced portrayal of blacks in the old South, alongside carpetbagging ""Yankees"" and their corrupt cronies riding into Atlanta to snatch the spoils of war...for displaying a Confederate battle flag...and showing Scarlett shooting a Union pillager in the face before he can rape her--To think that the 2nd Amendment and the Right to Bear Arms could actually MEAN something, and a pistol could come in handy!--NO, THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH for any decent animal rights-pushing victim-disarmer fanatic. This movie is too much for all the new-age people who want to estrogenize all men into wimpy effeminate slackers, and transform all women who should be ladies into neo-fascist female prison guards, patrol officers, and anger management counselors. Scarlett reminds all of us what can happen in a war, when inflation runs rampant and paper money is actually worth the paper it's printed on ($0). When she finds gold money on the Union soldier she shot dead, and exults in her financial salvation, it's enough to warm the cockles of any red-blooded American who understands the evils of the Federal Reserve system and taxes. Especially these days, in an age of decadence and ethical immorality, when our government is selling out its own people and running deficits as far as the eye can see, waging an endless war, and shredding the Constitution, it should remind all of us that our country too can fall, just as the South did, and we must be vigilant against our so-called ""leaders"" who could lead our nation and people into financial and social disaster. And then we would all have to survive like Scarlett had to. ""I swear, if I have to lie, cheat, steal, or..."" Yes, Scarlett, I agree. Too bad we don't have more women like you, like Melanie, like Ms. Belle, and more men like Rhett. Frankly, my dear, I give a damn."	5.0	A Film of War, a Film of Love, a Film of Survival....	2004-12-14	11	2	9

It makes me reflect on how far people would go to keep a lifestyle of slavery of other people.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1U01IU34T1JVR	Amazon Customer	Looking for a movie about the Civil War or Slave Days or even Reconstruction.  Then stay away from this movie.  You aren't going to see battle scenes or get a history lesson of any sort.  This movie isn't about the Civil War.  It's a story which just happens to take place during the Civil War.  Other than the time period, it has nothing to do with the Civil War.The story is actually about a young woman who marries twice for all the wrong reasons, is forced to grow up and do a man's job, and finally realizes that while she thought her happiness was just out of her grasp it was right in front of her the whole time.  In other words, it's a love story.If you want something which is more about the Civil War, yet has side stories going on, I recommend the Blue and the Gray or North and South.  Otherwise, go find a documentary.	5.0	The Greatest Romance Story of All Time	2002-02-08	1	1	0

But for years watching its strange, blurry video/DVD was just what we had grown accustomed to if we wanted to watch it. But now, blu-ray has brought us what seems to be, at least in my opinion, a miracle. The quality of this blu-ray is frankly, my dear, astounding. And I don't use that word lightly. Aside from the cheesy melodramatic score that came with the times, the sheer picture quality is so sharp it's shocking. This is on HD. It looks like it could have been made yesterday. Which in my opinion is the most amazing thing of all. This was a time before Anne Frank had even bought her diary. Think of just how long ago 1939 was... then look at the picture quality. If you're looking to buy this movie in hopes of the blu-ray being the best quality possible, then you are on the right track and it may even surprise you.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	"How does one even go about reviewing a film like `Gone with the Wind'?  I mean, it's a heady undertaking because of all the devotion heaped upon this film by fans of all ages.  This film is strongly considered one of the greatest films of all time.  You can place this alongside `The Godfather' and `Citizen Kane' as one of the hardest films to review because it has all been said time and time again.And how dare I only give it four stars and voice an argument against the films `perfection' status?Well, let me start by saying that `Gone with the Wind' is a very, very good film and one that I strongly recommend.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I saw the film years (nearly 15 of them) ago and I actually disliked it very much.  Upon recent viewings though, I have grown to not only adore the film but appreciate it.  It is a marvelous cinematic achievement and it rivals almost any film made today.  I mean, to even believe that this beautifully made film came out of 1939 just blows the mind.  Every technical aspect of this film is nearly flawless, and the acting is almost spot-on perfection.  It is no wonder to me that this film swept the Oscars (even if, personally, I wouldn't have handed it some of those big prizes).As far as epics go, this one is truly `epic'.Now that I've heaped on the praise, I'll get right into my few (but pivotal) complaints.  `Gone with the Wind' possesses a certain quality that I've also noticed in other oft-considered masterpieces such as `Schindler's List' and `The Grapes of Wrath'.  The film is almost too analytical.  It is so methodic and so `perfect' that it can, at times, run emotionally cold.  I don't feel the pangs of emotional turmoil that I should, even when everything around Scarlett is falling to pieces.  This `coldness' is a problem, but unlike `Schindler's List' and `The Grapes of Wrath' (which still managed a solid 5-star review from me), `Gone with the Wind' has a few other problems as well.Before I get lambasted for `holding a 1939 film up to today's standards' I want to state that I understand that this is a film made in different times, and I appreciate that this film also is about a certain place and time and thus has a responsibility to convey those times accurately.  Thus, I have no problem with the use of slavery here and I don't consider it racist.  What I do find a little preposterous though, is the way that slavery is candy coated here to be something that isn't `that bad'.  I mean, the only slaves depicted in the film are those who are treated kindly and considered `family'.  It almost seems like the subject is swept under the rug in order to build more sympathy for the South as a whole.  Yes, this is a movie, but the fact still remains that slavery was wrong and, while I don't agree with war at all, I will say that the right side did win.Another issue I have was the handling of Scarlett's character arc.  Personally I find this character to be one of the finest in the history of cinema.  It is a stunning character, one full of personality and one that actually has depth of emotional change as apposed to one persona throughout.  Scarlett changes over time, the realities of her situation helping to mold her.  She is a selfish and spoiled child, but she is also layered with a sliver of humanity that helps the viewer understand that she is at times sorely misunderstood.  This allows us to like her despite her unlikable actions.  We can understand why Rhett loves her like he does.  That said (SPOILERS), when Melanie is dying and Scarlett has the audacity, in conversation with Ashley, to make it all about her I lost all compassion I had begun to feel for her.  It was a horrible moment and one that single handedly killed a character for me.  It was unnecessary (yes, we need to see her tonal shift and her realizations, but the way they could have been displayed in another way) and it was just in bad taste.Also, just a minor complaint, but how in the world did Scarlett's daughter wind up basically the same age as Melanie's son?UGH, all that said, there are some more plusses for me to talk about.  I think that the acting here, for the most part, is a triumph.  Vivian Leigh is simply stunning.  She has her moments of over the top theatrics (I find that ""god is my witness"" scene to be a tad humorous in its dramatics) but overall she is pitch-perfect here.  Olivia de Havilland is OMG perfection here.  She is such a warming actress, and her development of the kind hearted contrast to Scarlett is simply mesmerizing to watch.  I love Hattie McDaniel here, but de Havilland should have won that Oscar.  Speaking of Hattie, her wise-cracking Mammy was just spot-on.  You really felt the warmth in her tone, and that stairway ascension, as she explains to Melanie the poor condition of Rhett (""It makes my blood run cold, the things they say to one another.""), it's just so incredibly moving.  Leslie Howard is great here (he was one of the greatest), and Thomas Mitchell was all sorts of paternal splendor as Scarlett's father.One performance that I don't agree with the masses on is that of Clark Gable.  He was serviceable, and I understand why it is considered on of those influential `manly' performances, but overall he just wasn't that great for me.  His final exit scene aside, he didn't really capture all that I felt necessary, and he even came over as a tad stiff in the films first half.  Also, he isn't in very much of the film, so I find it hard to understand the whole `Lead Actor' placement.Scarlett O'Hara is the only lead here.The production design, the film's editing, the direction, the costumes, the cinematography, the score...every technical aspect is stunning and truly redefined cinema.  Yes, the first half of the film far outweighs (in my opinion) the second, but despite my complaints I still consider this a triumphant film that has earned the praise it has received."	4.0	A breathtaking achievement in cinema...	2010-04-05	4	1	3
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1B2T9LI5KWT8P	Andrew Simmons	You have to give credit to this film for its glossy, epic sweep and the fact that it breaks new ground in filmmaking techniques. Unfortunately, the film, like the novel, promotes a destructive, romantic myth of a south that never really existed.In this Technicolor version of the Old South all the darkies are happy and smiling and dancing on the banks of the Mississippi, and obviously it's too bad the Civil War came along and ruined things. What a trashy message, and the terrible thing is that its wrapped in such a seductive and attractive package.	2.0	Romantic Racism	2003-05-28	14	4	10

Will Benteen, Wade Hamilton and Ella Kennedy don't even exist in this film. Scarlett's relationship with Rhett seems to be the main focus. As a result, you never get a true sense of the struggles Scarlett has had to endure. The starvation, the desperation to provide for Tara's residents, the transformation of a once pampered princess into a hard working woman doing the work of slaves. We don't get a true sense of the development of her money grubbing ways, or the extent to which she alienates old friends in her pursuit of financial security.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2SPMLHB7ZA836	Ann	"Even this movie is 4 hours long, it is a true classic! This story begins with the flirty Scarlett who has men fawning over her but she loves only one man: Ashley Wilkes. She married Charles Hamiliton just to make Ashley jealous, but Ashley's only interested in Charles' sister, Melanie who married him. Later, as a widow, Scarlett meets Rhett Butler, who is really the ""true love"" of her life and she doesn't know it until it was too late at the end of the film.All through the film, there was the Civil War, famine, slaves, dying and dead soldiers lying on the streets of Atlanta (that pans out across the screen as Scarlett was looking for the doctor to deliver Melanie's baby), babies being born, deaths, and Scarlett's obsession over Ashley. Oh yes, Scarlett's self-centered ways appeared throughout the film as she married 2nd husband who was one of her sisters' fiance (she lied her way to marry him for money), and hiring slavery in her own lumber business. She obviously didn't care for the first two men she married, and didn't realize that Rhett is the real love of her life until after he said ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" at the end.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z	Annie Van Auken	"Jewel in the crown of the greatest year in motion picture history is GONE WITH THE WIND, David Selznick's epic four-hour adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel. Part soap opera/part chronicle of an Antebellum way of life soon to disappear forever, that of genteel Southerners made rich from plantation slave labor. Leigh is the self-centered mistress of stately Tara, a woman who loves unrequitedly but marries other men to advance herself financially. In the end she loses devoted husband Rhett (Gable), their young daughter Bonnie Blue (King) and the man of her dreams, Ashley Wilkes (Howard), yet Scarlett O'Hara undauntedly thinks only of a better tomorrow. A bit long in spots but worth the investment of time.GWTW TRIVIANA--The first cut ran 4.5 hour but 48 minutes were trimmed before release. Since then, not a second of footage has been eliminated from various home video versions.The crane shot where Scarlett searches for Dr. Meade was devised by Val Lewton. He went on to produce a number of classic fright films, includingCAT PEOPLE(1942) andTHE BODY SNATCHER(1945).Clark Gable's per-day salary was five times as much as Vivien Leigh's.Yakima Canutt stunted for Gable in the burning of Atlanta sequence, which was the very first scene shot in what would be a marathon production.Motion picture debut of George Reeves (TV'sSuperman).Margaret Mitchell borrowed the novel's title from Ernest Dowson's poem, ""Cynara"": ""I have forgot much Cynara! Gone with the wind."" Mitchell also considered calling it ""Bugles Sang True,"" ""Tomorrow is Another Day"" and ""Ba! Ba! Black Sheep."" Ashley Wilkes was based on the author's cousin by marriage, 'Doc' Holliday of OK Coral fame.Martin Luther King Jr. attended the world premiere cotillion ball in Atlanta with his father, an invited guest. Also at the premiere were a handful of Confederate Civil War veterans.First color movie to win the Best Picture Oscar, also the longest-running. Was nominated for 13 Oscars.The story of this classic film's creation is almost as dramatic as the movie itself. A two-hour 1988 television documentary,THE MAKING OF A LEGEND: GONE WITH THE WIND, is an ideal companion piece. Narrated by Christopher Plummer, it includes archival footage, screen tests and interviews with several who were involved in the production from both sides of the camera.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(8.2) Gone With the Wind (1939) - Vivien Leigh/Clark Gable/Leslie Howard/Olivia de Havilland/Barbara O'Neil/Thomas Mitchell/Ann Rutherford/Hattie McDaniel/Butterfly McQueen/George Reeves/Evelyn Keyes/Victor Jory/Cammie King/Ward Bond/Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson/Cliff Edwards/Yakima Canutt (uncredited: Marjorie Reynolds/Si Jenks)"	5.0	"Scarlett: ""Tara!

My girlfriend (who read the book) says it doesn't line up with the book 100% but it does a decent enough job. Most movies from books have this problem, so if it bothers you, you might want to stay away. I realize that the book is very large and thus to tell the story the movie must be long too, but it is difficult to sit through it all in one take.

The point is that this is the greatest American film since ""Birth of a Nation.""  Watch in awe as Scarlett and Ashley pine for the bygone days when the soft high sound of Negro laughter rises like the Louisiana marsh mist from the decrepit, rat-infested slave quarters swimming in lice and feces.  Chortle with Rhett as he sprays misogyny across Georgia like an alley cat with a urinary tract infection.  Pray with the Confederacy as it bravely attempts to defend time-honored traditions of patriarchal subjugation, racist contempt for human life and belligerent arrogance bordering on the psychotic.  Boo and hiss as uppity Negroes humiliate the once proud South by asking for things like civil rights and a decent standard of living.  Cheer for Scarlett (again) as she pops all her scruples like over-ripe zits in her pathological quest for a goal even she doesn't understand.  And finally, share in the triumph of the filmmakers as they achieve the astounding feat of creating sympathy and admiration for one of the most sordid and shameful chapters in American history.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1UKYKIO8APUZA	ardar88	What's not to love?  This movie is required viewing for any film buff.  It's one of the best adaptations of a book ever brought to the screen.  It manages to hold interest for almost four hours, unlike many three-plus hour [...]-numbing epics of today that could stand to lose an hour or more off their running times.  This story moves, without a single lull.  Standout performances by everybody involved, both in front of and behind the camera.  It is truly a benchmark in filmmaking that has rarely been equaled.GWTW also remains the #1 box office champ of all time in terms of the number of people who have seen it.  More recent lists of highest grossing films don't take inflation into account.  A movie ticket in 1939 cost twenty-five cents.The restoration is breathtaking. The original 35mm Technicolor negatives were used and it makes the film look almost like it was produced yesterday.This is an all-time classic that shouldn't be missed!	5.0	One of the best movies ever made.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3UUF0T87UNS9R	argytunes	"The 70th Anniversary ""Gone With The Wind"" 3-DVD set was very good.  Like most versions, the color was excellent and the source material was fine.  GWTW is one of those films everybody should see once a year simply because it brought so many wonderful actors and behind-the-scenes professionals together.I was hoping that this edition would consolidate the earlier 4-disc compilation which included a separate DVD of GONE WITH THE WIND extras. Unfortunately, the only major extra is the excellent ""MAKING OF GONE WITH THE WIND"" Documentary narrated by Christopher Plummer. This has stood the test of time. It features plenty of information about David O Selznik and how he had to borrow money from his Father-In-Law, Louis B. Mayer in order to have the film completed. Along with the behind the scenes info, there are various screen tests of potential Scarlett O'Haras and Rhett Butlers. But the ""where are they now"" and additional documentary material featured on the 4-Disc GWTW set has been omitted here. Why Warner Bros (the distributor) couldn't have included portions of the surviving cast member interviews puzzles me???If you can handle the fact that some of the extras are ""gone with the wind"" on this updated release---then add it to your collection!

I had the 50th anniversary VHS collector's edition (black box), and this just blows that one out of the water for me. My box arrived a little torn on one edge, but I am not that surprised, given the fragile material it's made from. Wasn't that big a deal to me. I am just so excited to finally be able to have this movie on DVD, and in such a beautiful package that can adorn my shelf, on display with my other GWTW collectibles. I am especially enamored with the reproduction of the original program. One of the little extras in the box has some interesting factoids that most avid fans will already know, but that I still enjoy reading about. I am obviously super pleased with my purchase! :) Those complaining about the price are IMO, crazy! DVD sets that come with nothing but a thin box and 2 discs cost $20+, and you get so much more in this set. If you already have this movie on DVD, and are looking for something extra on the discs themselves, and aren't in it for the other goodies in the box, then this isn't for you!

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2WFNZWC8O6O1J	Atticus	GONE WITH THE WIND doesn't top the AFI's Top Movies list, but, from a person that's seen all of the films preceding it (excluding THE GODFATHER), it should be.  This is a marvellous film, and what makes it the greatest is that it fully utilizes and takes advantage of every means that movies can use to astound us.  Here in this movie we have memorable dialogue, rich, developed characters, grand, sweeping visuals, an unabashadley romantic plot, taut suspense, and a lucious score.I won't bother to describe the plot; everyone knows what it is.  But I will take some time to praise the acting, which is amazing.  Vivien Leigh is perfect in her role as Scarlett, the main character.  Scarlett is a very unique character, very cunning, ruthless, and manipulating but also extremely sympathetic.  I attribute this completely to Leigh's brilliant acting.  Clark Gable is good in his role as her lover (and later husband) Rhett Butler, but, in my opinion, he always takes backseat to Leigh in his scenes with her.  Both Olivia de Havilland and Hattie McDaniel were nominated for Oscars for their supporting performances as Melanie Wilkes (Scarlett's love's wife) and Mammy (Scarlett's maid and caretaker), respectively.  McDaniel won, and though de Havilland's is the better performance, her's was exceptional as well.  Another true gem in this movie is Ona Munson as Rhett's friend the prostitute Belle Watling, with an undesirable life but a heart of gold.  Her brief scene with Melanie in the buggy is high on my list of the most beautiful cinematic moments.This is a film for the ages, to be adored by generations.  It is truly perfect, and it would be pretty hard not to love it.  Share it with your kids.  It's a perfect gateway into cinematic magic.	5.0	The Greatest Film Ever Made...	2009-06-10	1	1	0

It has some of the best acting ever placed on film. Vivien Leigh is the perfect chioce for Scarlett, the Southern Bell who has never experienced any pain worse than a sunburn!

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1PASRZ81DY9C	Austin Somlo	Viewed: 3/05, 2/08, 4/12Rate: 92/08: As impressive as it could be, Gone with the Wind is a one-of-a-kind picture. Despite the length, Gone with the Wind was abounded with excellent performances, dazzled in its picturesque cinematography, and reveled in the unfolding of the story. I am sort of in an impasse when it comes to who gave the best performance of the picture: Vivien Leigh, Clark Cable, or Olivia de Havilland. Speaking of supporting performances, I must say that the accolades for Hattie McDaniel, with no disrespect to her, were undeserving because Olivia de Havilland was a lot more impressively brilliant. Her performance as Melanie Hamilton was the key of keeping the story of Gone with the Wind together. And, of course, who could be more dashing than Clark Gable as Captain Rhett Butler or bitchier than Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara? The most impressive feature of Gone with the Wind was not only the story, the acting, and the cinematography but rather everything possible that worked together as a whole. At an astonishing length of 233 minutes, Gone with the Wind couldn't have been longer? Since its inception in 1939, Gone with the Wind remains a timeless treasure in silver screen history, and it will always remain a piece of history. Rather than writing any more about the picture, it's best to see Gone with the Wind and feel the quality. In short, Gone with the Wind is one of the handful greatest classics ever.4/12: Although I know that Gone with the Wind is considered as a masterpiece and I agree with it, I am going to lower my rating from `10' to `9'. I found the whole film to be ridiculous in terms of prose, mannerisms, and types of Southern messages it was sending out. I couldn't even care for the characters except maybe for Rhett Butler. But boy...Scarlett O'Hara is a one big crock of ****. I thought she ruined the film for me with her prancing around as the royal b*tch of the highest order. The fact that Hattie McDaniel won the Oscar for her role soured the film as well. She wasn't that good, and the portrayal of her character was subtly racist as her life was devoted to the O'Hara Family, a group of characters I couldn't care much for. There are four chief problems with Gone with the Wind. One, it's not that racist. Impossible, but typical of Hollywood to do so. I mean, this is the Civil War South we are talking about. No blacks would want to stay devoted to their white families after the Emancipation Proclamation. Probably the worst character was the one played by Butterfly McQueen...Jeeesssusss, you must be joking me. Notice the secret meeting that the women covered up for their menfolk. That was actually the KKK meeting some were part of. Shows you that the KKK group got a favorable light there for no good reason (It's the Birth of the Nation all over again). Two, it's just too pretty of a picture. Impossible. After the South got (and deservingly so) burned down, everybody still looked too pretty. Impossible. Three, nobody really aged over time. Everybody still looked the same no matter what year it was. Finally, the fourth...Scarlett O'Hara....my goodness, she ruined the film for me. To call her the worst character ever would be quite an understatement. I think she needs to be thrown in the gutters and left to starve, just to teach her a lesson. I couldn't take a minute of her. What the hell is so special about Tara? It's just a freaking land with a rundown house! On the other hand, the performances were outstanding, and the cinematography was the winning feature. The costumes and the interior/exterior pieces were topnotch. I mean, just about everything was perfect except for the direction of the writing material...that I can do without. Quite frankly, the film was too farking long to watch. The only performance worth seeing for me was Clark Gable's. He was the best of any. All in all, Gone with the Wind is worth watching anyway, at least for the technical aspects.	5.0	Overrated in One Way And Magnificent in Another Way.	2012-04-28	10	1	9

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A26R9RQATQ0PQL	Babeur	The movie follows the life of a southern belle, scarlett O'hara, from the beginning of the civil war through a few years after the end of it. Scarlett starts off as this spoiled 16 year old girl living in the cocoon of her very wealthy southern family and the plantation home that goes along with it. She thinks each man that sets eyes on her falls for her and she flirts with everyone of them. But the war brings an end to her idillic world. THe movie follows her every moves: how she behaves to overcome hunger, death of loved ones, survives through the fires of atlanta and fights off Sherman's soldiers in her own house. Scarlett is probably the most selfish and determined female character ever portrayed on screen. On the one hand, she makes you cringe because of how she does anything to reach her goals, regardless of how she treats people, but on the other hand, she's admirable for being so determined and never giving up no matter how difficult the situation is.Gone with the Wind was the most popular book of the 30s. Bringing to the screen such a long and rich story was a very difficult task for David O. Selznick. He did a great job at staying faithful to the story and the characters.The extra features of the DVD are great. They include a recent interview of Olivia de Havilland (Melanie). She tells how she came about to star in Gone with the Wind and gives anecdote from the shooting of the movie. She tells her fond memories with lots of warmth and enthusiasm, it's just delightful. The DVD also contains a wonderful 2-hour long documentary about the making of the movie. It's almost as good as the movie. The last disc has biographies of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh.This movie, along with the extra features (especially the making of) is a must buy for any classic movie fan.	5.0	This is why DVDs were invented!	2005-01-12	15	13	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"This is a historical classic on two levels: the history of the Civil War and reconstruction era, and the history of movie-making. It's four hours long, and broke all sorts of records in its day, including ten academy awards.Vivien Leigh is Scarlett O'Hara, spoiled young southern belle who doesn't want talk of war to interfere with her pleasures. She has apparently never tasted anything but pleasures in her entire life. Men flock to her because she is pretty, but she's a flirt and a tease, and harbors a secret passion for her neighbor, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). As the movie opens, she learns that Ashley is about to become engaged to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia De Haviland). Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) is a guest at the Wilkes barbecue, where the engagement is announced. Scarlett makes a fool of herself telling Ashley that she loves him, he can't marry Melanie. But it's plain he does love Melanie, who loves him. Rhett overhears Scarlett's melodramatic confrontation with Ashley, and is amused.In fact, Rhett Butler is consistently amused by Scarlett through most of the movie. She marries Melanie's brother, becomes a widow almost before she was ever really a wife. She goes to stay with Aunt Pittypat in Atlanta not because she is grieving for her husband, but because she hates wearing black and wants a chance to see city society. Rhett Butler is in Atlanta, now a blockade runner for the south. When Atlanta falls to the Yankees, Rhett helps Scarlett, Melanie and Melanie's newborn baby escape back to Tara, Scarlett's plantation home.She finds the Yankees have been through, burned the Wilkes' place to the ground, and made a shambles of Tara in using it for their headquarters. Her two sisters have been sick, her mother is dead, and her father has lost his mind. She bravely holds the plantation together with just her sisters and two servants. But the carpetbaggers have raised the taxes to an amount she does not have, and she decides to go to Atlanta and ask Rhett Butler for it. This is the famous green gown made from the curtains which she needed to visit Rhett. The Yankees have him in prison, but he's comfortably playing poker with his guards.Back at Aunt Pittypat's house, which she abandoned when the Yankees arrived in Atlanta, Scarlett briefly marries her sister's former beau, now a successful retail merchant. He is killed in an attack on a nest of drifters who had frightened Scarlett. She's so busy seeing to Ashley's wounds that she forgot to ask about her husband until Rhett brought it up. That's when Rhett told her that she is a widow once more. He soon proposes to her, convinced he's got to catch her ""between husbands.""They have a child, Bonnie Blue Butler, whom Rhett idolizes. But Scarlett tells him she doesn't want any more children, and so he must sleep alone.Then Bonnie is killed in a fall from her pony, and Rhett is inconsolable. Finally, Melanie dies and Scarlett realizes that Ashley always did love Melanie and not her, and that she really does love Rhett. But it's too late. He utters his famous line, ""Frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn,"" and exits.I've told you a lot, but there is so much more that I don't feel guilty in the least. This is the barest outline of the story, which is richly detailed and very well done. The actors are all pretty good, although Scarlett's two sisters are pretty amateurish. The costumes and sets are superb, and the special effects in the burning of Atlanta are spectacular, especially considering it was done in 1939."	5.0	Still One of the Best Movies Ever Made	2012-05-19	2	2	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1MUNVPTR4H1UM	Barbara K. Cable	"I just can't understand the high praise given to the movie. To the book, yes. But the movie?!? Let me start by saying that I LOVE the book version of GWTW. I've read it at least 20 times since the age of 16 (MANY years ago!).However, the movie version does no justice to the book. Interestingly, I've learned over the years that many people who love the movie have never read the book. So maybe that's where the high praise for the movie comes from.And now, I'll commit the worst heresy. Clark Gable is just AWFUL as Rhett Butler!! Yes, he does look like him, but the resemblance ends there. I'm wondering if he was brought in for ""box office draw."" Gable does not even begin to capture the character of Rhett. First, Gable refused to play the part of Rhett with a Southern accent. How arrogant! This was a character born and raised in the deep South, who emphasized his drawl when angry. Also, Clark Gable is one-dimensional in the movie. The only part of Rhett Butler's character that he manages to successfully play is the mocking, sarcastic part. However, he plays Rhett's character completely in this mode. Much of Rhett's character is very subtle; shown only in a glance or an expression. Gable either does not understand this, or chooses to ignore it.Vivien Leigh is much better. She puts a great deal of effort into her part. The other parts that are left in the movie (and many are deleted) are fairly well acted.Incidentally, if you are really interested in ""behind the scenes""  information about both the book AND the movie, please read ""Margaret Mitchell and John Marsh: The Love Story Behind 'Gone With the Wind'"". I read this book after the first writing of this review. It revealed many fascinating facts, including the fact that Southeners did NOT want Clark Gable as Rhett in the movie; nor did he want to play the part.My advice?

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y	Ben Adam	Having been born and raised in the South, I read and saw Gone With the Wind so many times that I have memorized every word of it. One might think that with such an inundation, I might be blinded to the good and bad of the work, but I have had years to evaluate Gone With the Wind, and while I was never swept away by it to the extent that some people were, I still acknowledge that in terms of motion picture history, it was a monumental achievement.Margaret Mitchell's novel did not pretend to be history. Most Southerners were not plantation owners, and certainly Irish Catholics -- or any Catholics -- were not in the majority in the South. The novel was fiction, as is the film, and the film is an adaptation that omits considerable parts of the novel.If, however, a person viewing the film looks at the film as a work of pure fiction and only as fiction, the film can easily be charming. Vivien Leigh plays the part of Scarlett O'Hara with an ease and grace that won her the Oscar for Best Actress quite justifiably. Clark Gable is so natural in the part of Rhett Butler that most people suspected that Margaret Mitchell thought of him when she wrote the book; she claimed that she had conceived the role for Groucho Marx, which was very difficult to believe after seeing Gable in the role. The roles of Melanie and Ashley are both roles of people who are less than believable characters by definition, and Olivia DeHavilland and Leslie Howard fill those roles more than adequately. Hattie McDaniel's Mammy is unforgettable.By today's standards, the film smacks of racism, but that is to be expected from a film that deals with a society that condoned slavery. The picture of slavery shown in the film, however, is far too romanticized to be real, and the portrayals of the slaves would raise objections by today's standards for sure. The portrayal of Mammy by Hattie McDaniel was the first to win an Oscar for an African American, but it must be remembered also that when the film premi&egrave;red, her picture was disallowed in the playbills published in Atlanta. As endearing as her performance and that of Butterfly McQueen as Prissy might have been, racism was indeed a factor at the time the film was made, and there is no way to mask it.The digitally remastered quality of the DVD has given the film a freshness that belies its age, but it must be kept in mind that the effects were made back in 1939 without the technology of today. Some of the effects look dated, and the background music sounds antiquated at times, but scenes such as the burning of Atlanta were significant accomplishments for that time and age and still come off as impressive.View Gone With the Wind as entertainment and for what it is: as fiction, not as history. There is so much to enjoy and appreciate.	5.0	A Hollywood Epic of an Old South Legend	2005-07-11	5	4	1

There's no doubt that this movie is an epic and was well made, but I found myself willing myself to finish the movie because of the dreadful conduct of its protagonist. I know many others will disagree with me, and I would allow that this movie should be considered a classic (pretty hard to argue with its box office success).

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A31I3HXMD5H1EL	Benjamin J Burgraff	"It seems like a 'new, improved' edition of ""Gone With the Wind"" has appeared every couple of years, offering the 'ultimate' in picture and sound reproduction, and extras. It can become expensive keeping up, and frustrating (much like buying a classic Disney DVD, when you know a more complete ""Special Edition"" will soon render your ""First Time on Video"" copy obsolete), but the new GWTW Four-Disc Collector's Edition most assuredly deserves a place in your collection.First off, the picture and sound quality is astonishing. Warner's Ultra-Resolution process, which 'locks' the three Technicolor strips into exact alignment, provides a clarity and 'crispness' to the images that even the 1939 original print couldn't achieve. You'll honestly believe your TV is picking up HD, whether you're HD-ready, or not! This carries over to the  Dolby Digital-remastered sound, as well. All of the tell-tale hiss and scratchiness of the opening credit title music, still discernable in the last upgrade, is gone, replaced by a richness of tone that will give your home theater a good workout. (Listen to the brass in this sequence, and you'll notice what I'm talking about...)The biggest selling point of this edition is, of course, the two discs of additional features offered, and these are, in general, superb. Beginning with the excellent ""Making of a Legend"" (narrated by Christopher Plummer), Disc Three offers fascinating overviews about the film, the amazing restoration, footage from the 1939 Premiere (and the bittersweet 1961 Civil War Centennial reunion of Selznick, Leigh, and de Havilland), glimpses of Gable and Leigh with dubbed voices for the foreign-language versions, the international Prologue (tacked on to explain the Civil War to foreign audiences), and a 1940 MGM documentary on the ""Old South"" (directed by Fred Zinneman) memorable today for it's simplistic view of the time, and stereotypical portrayal of blacks.Disc Four is a mixed bag; the long-awaited reminiscences of Olivia de Havilland are more chatty than informative (with the 90-year-old actress more interested in discussing her wardrobe than on-set tension...although a prank she pulled on Gable is amusing), and the Clark Gable Profile is superficial (A&E;'s biography of 'The King' is far superior). Things improve, however, with the insightful, sympathetic TCM biography of Vivien Leigh (hosted by Jessica Lange), and a WONDERFUL section devoted to brief bios of many of the GWTW supporting cast, narrated, again, by Christopher Plummer (although I wish the filmmakers would have included bios for Ward Bond, Victor Jory, Fred Crane, and George 'Superman' Reeves).All in all, the GWTW Four-Disc Collector's Edition isn't perfect, but offers so much terrific material that it is CERTAINLY the one to own!"	5.0	Near-Perfect Edition of Hollywood Classic...	2004-12-22	696	654	42

I identify with Rhet Butler and it's  the kind of man I've grown to become, not because of this movie, it's just  the way I was born.

It's a movie  about two men who dispise themselves and a total brat (Scarlett was 20 when  Tara was ruined by Union soldiers). Buy this movie and watch it again.  Especially watch Rhett's expression at the end when Scarlett realizes that  Ashley will be free of Melanie now that she has died. It is not a look of  &quot;Frankly, I don't give a damn.&quot; It's a look of hurt. Ala, I'm  leaving but I'll be back. And Scarlett goes to Tara where her power lays.  The late Vivian Leigh was asked if Scarlett would ever get Rhett back. She  replied, &quot;No. But I think that she would be a better person.&quot;  This is suprising of Ms. Leigh since she read the book several times before  starring in this masterpiece. Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett is about the  best I've ever seen. She doesn't hesitate like the rest of the characters!  She just behaves. It's really incredible. Ashley is a man of the past.  Rhett is a man of the future. Both lost in time. Rhett has been casted out  by his family. His adventurous urges are not of a gentleman of the South.  And despite his charm, he hates himself for what he is. Ashley has created  a complete dream world of the past in which he lives. And he admits it!  Scarlett is incredibly non-well-meaning! I have nearly gagged when she  bought slave labor consisting of Confederate prisoners. Brrrrrr.  Nevertheless, Rhet really loves her because she is a &quot;selfish rascal  like himself&quot;. Which is sort of like telling a woman, &quot;I love you  because you're ugly like me.&quot; Melanie is the heroine. As Rhett states  in the book, &quot;Her eyes are like two good deeds looking out on a dark  world.&quot; She is unselfish. The others are, well... Only Rhett really  spots this. And Gable plays his part brillantly (and without enough  credit). Howard is a bit stagey but gets away with it. DeHavilland pours  the syrup a bit thick but also manages to pull off her portrayal of Melanie  brillantly. All in all, this is a superb film. Buy it and try to  &quot;feel&quot; what the characters are really going through. Forget all  the music and all the fluff and pay attention. The character portrayals are  great. But realize what you are watching. Except for Melanie, these are not  happy people. Watch it again but get under the skin of these characters.  It's really a different movie when you do so.	5.0	A Movie About Misery	2000-09-05	1	1	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AR1ETOUG2OQ9V	Bill Holt	First of all, be aware that several other reviews appear to be for a different item. This is a ONE DISK product, true to the description, with no special features other than a commentary mode. It does NOT have multiple disks, and does NOT include, for example &#34;The Making of a Legend.&#34; It is full screen, not wide screen, but as has been pointed out elsewhere, that format is appropriate for this movie, as well as most other moves before the mid 1950s.The video quality is excellent, the main reason I rated it high. I also found the commentary to be interesting, although I had hoped for less general information about the actors and others associated with GWTW, and more Gone With the Wind-specific information. I do wish it had more features. I suppose at its price, that is being greedy on my part, but having a little more to offer would certainly have kicked it up to a 5-star rating.Pros: Blu-ray format, excellent video quality, good audio, reasonably good commentary mode. Many language choices (half a dozen other than English) and even more sub-title choices.Cons: commentary mode and language selection are the only features.	4.0	Beware: read the description, not just the reviews	2012-12-07	2	1	1

I'm glad I did.The picture and sound are top-notch. I did notice a few visual imperfections, but they were very minimal given the age of the source material.The commentary track with historian Rudy Behlmer was a bit disappointing, but I guess we're lucky to get anything given the fact that very few people involved in making the film are still alive. It did have a few good tidbits, though, like pointing out a bit player who would go on to voice Jiminy Cricket in Disney's Pinocchio.I was also pleased to find that this edition does include English subtitles, although they vary noticeably from the script in several places.Hardcore Gone With the Wind fans would probably be better served by the four-disc edition, but for the casual fan this two-disc edition for under $10 is hard to beat.	4.0	Fiddle-dee-dee!	2010-12-24	5	4	1

Jarquin ""BookGirl101"""	"Gone With the Wind is originally a novel that later is adapted into this breathtaking masterpiece and  it takes place in the antebellum South. Scarlett O'Hara, a stubborn, strong-willed, lively young girl, is the main character. The beginning of the novel starts with her ordinary life: attending barbeques, flirting with her beaus, and worrying about what to wear. As the novel goes on, however, many trials, ultimately brought on by the war, turn Scarlett's world upside down, and all that she knows and takes for granted, disappears. These trials include escaping Atlanta when the Yankees come, remarrying twice, dealing with the death of her mother, and returning home to find that everything has changed. However, even though these would be a reason for anyone to stop living, the trials actually bring out how strong Scarlett really is, even though for the first 15-16 years of her life, she was pampered and lived in luxury. Through all of this, Scarlett believes she loves Ashley Wilkes, a boy from her childhood, brought up to be the epitome of 'good breeding'. She also has to deal with Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's wife, because in her despair, Scarlett rashly agreed to marry Melanie's brother, Charles. Most of Scarlett's main decisions are influenced by her infatuation with Ashley and her belief that they are supposed to be together. However, Scarlett's third husband, Rhett Butler, is the one she actually loves, although she doesn't know it. Rhett is the opposite of a gentleman in the eyes of the old-tradition Southerners, but his personality matches Scarlett. Both came from good families, but Rhett was disowned from his, and Scarlett goes against many of the lessons and etiquette she was taught. Underneath all the training, however, Scarlett is just as rebellious as Rhett and, she lets go of all her proper teachings to stay alive and support her family and relatives. She ends up not caring what others think, and holds onto the mantra of ""I'll think of it tomorrow"". Through her trials, she unwittingly comes to love and respect Melanie, even though she thinks she hates her for marrying Ashley. However, Melanie is the only woman in her life who actually really loved her. Also, Melanie is the one who makes Scarlett realize how much Rhett loves her, even though he never lets her know it. Because of this, Scarlett rushes back to Rhett, only to find that he ""doesn't give a damn"" anymore, but Scarlett's strong personality keeps her from breaking, and the novel as well as the movie ends with her words, ""tomorrow is another day.""The actors in this movie played their parts with such feelings that for a moment i felt i was like right there watching it all.would recomend it to anybody at any age!!!"	5.0	LOVED IT!!!!!!!!BEWARE THOUGH MAJOR SPOILER DEAD AHEAD!	2011-11-26	5	3	2

I love it because this movie is well made, and has nothing to do with historically accurate as a history book. I love it because is 1939 movie and does not reflect the values of the 21st century. I love it because my attention span is not short that I must only see movies from 90-120 minutes in length. I love it because I do not only accept or care for politically correct films. I love it because I know that widescreen movies were not made before the 1950s. I love it because is great without computerized special effects as they appear in modern films. I love it because my idea of great acting is not to be found in slasher or teen films being made these days.	5.0	Great movie; great acting; wonderfully made;	2010-12-20	4	1	3
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AV74NYPSKHXBU	Black Plum	"I loved Gone With the Wind, so I really wanted to see the 1939 movie, which is a very famous movie. I had  mixed feelings about it. I mean, it was entertaining to a certain extent, but it didn't really stay very true to the book. For example, Scarlett is supposed to have a son with Charles Hamilton and a daughter with Frank Kennedy, and they cut both of those children out! It was annoying. But I do think that they got Clark Gable as Rhett Butler exactly right. He fits the character very well. And I enjoyed Scarlett.The movie was kind of cheesy though. Cheesy music, and a somewhat infuriating portrayal of the South (much like the book) of a ""perfect"" society ""gone with the wind."" Hmm, I wonder if you asked the field hands what they thought, if they would have called it that. But the movie was made in 1939, as you've got to remember. Another thing was that even though the movie is nearly 4 hours long, it still feels rushed! I remember in the book when Scarlett first arrives in Atlanta, she is impressed by its immensity and surprised by the variety of people there. Completely skipped over. And many other important scenes. However, I do think the venue of film is better for doing justice to the scale of the sheer horror of the Civil War. That was quite effective.I had a few other niggling complaints, but overall, it was an entertaining movie, and though it didn't remain faithful to the book, I still basically enjoyed it, though not as much as A Tale of Two Cities (the movie). Review to come later on that. So, if you enjoyed the book, you should give the movie a try. You may not like it, or then again, you may like it better.3.5 stars.All of my book/movie reviews can be read at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."	3.0	An Unfaithful But Interesting Film Adaption	2012-10-16	5	2	3
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ	Blahblahblah	"If you look beyond the great acting, the magnificent sets, the sweeping landscapes and breathtaking cinematography, ""Gone With the Wind"" is little more than a high budget soap opera. Much of the movie is taken up by the very silly and unmoving romance between Scarlett and Rhett, two shallow characters who obviously do not belong together, and the various tragedies which befall them after they enter into a sham of a marriage (although it is often difficult to feel much sympathy for a couple living in lavish mansions). The only thing which sets the film apart from the usual daily soap operas about self-desctructive rich people (besides its budget) is its backdrop of the Civil War. However, if you want to see a historical film which at least partially resembles reality, then do not watch ""Gone With the Wind"".The picture the movie draws of the pre-Civil War south is an overly romantic one of beauty and wealth and civility. Sure, a very small elite of rich landowners did live a lovely and leisurely life in the old south, much like the one portrayed in the opening of the movie, but this was done on the backs of slaves. However, this film makes the old south look like an unspoiled paradise in which nobody had to work. The only thing spoiling this film's picture of a perfect society is the spoiled-brat attitude of the egocentric Scarlett O'Hara, but she is clearly portrayed as an anomally as other characters try to put up with her antics.After the invaders from the north are shown to impose their way of life upon the south (seemingly by merely introducing industrialization, and the concept of work), Scarlett is faced with a total inability to adapt to the new society. However, with her frequent stirring speeches about never going hungry again (yeah, right, try actually living in poverty for a day or two) her inability to adapt is more a condemnation of the changes caused by the Civil War than an exploration of any weakness in Scarlett's character. Gone are the days of dances in large halls and picnics on vast tree-covered lawns (as the blacks toil under the baking sun in the far-off fields). Instead, we get scenes of poor rich people loading up buggies to move off of their plantations and into mansions inside of cities only blocks away from the (choke) working classes.In case the viewer doesn't quite get the picture of the ""injustice"" done to the south and thinks ""what about the abolition of slavery?"", every single black character in the movie is offensively portrayed as lazy, silly, and superstitious caricatures who are devoted to and love their white masters and are lost without them. The fact that ""Gone With the Wind"" hasn't faced as much widespread condemnation as ""Birth of a Nation"" with its pro-KKK scenes is rather surprising.The only reason I can figure out that such a worthless and offensive soap opera is still considered so great is that most critics are afraid to contradict decades of praise given to the movie at the risk of seeming to lack taste. I say stop being blinded by expectations or conformity and actually judge the film for what it is."	2.0	High Budget Soap Opera	2002-06-22	33	14	19

It has to be clearer, better and more colorful than any showing of GWTW ever.  It certainly is much better than all the times I have seen it before throughout my life - whether in a theater or at home!  Also, the first two-thirds of the movie tells a great story in fantastic detail and, to this day, is enjoyable to watch - as good or better than even the best movies of today.Now the bad news.  The final third of the movie still seems rushed and overly melodramatic.  This is the most dated part of the film.  It's like they ran out of money and time to really finish GWTW properly back in the day.  Not so good.Perhaps someone will be brave enough to one day remake GWTW into a new movie trilogy.  Potentially, it could be bigger than any trilogy ever made if done well.  But, until then, this 70 year plus old GWTW is good enough.	3.0	A Classic For Sure BUT	2012-12-19	2	0	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2RJGB4BT7Z9LK	"""bookaweek"""	So the film is racist. Until racism is completely eradicated -- and, let's face it, we still have quite a ways to go -- let's not get too smug about the film's take on slavery. So the special effects look a little creaky in places. Well, the same can be said about Star Wars. Movies are products of their times. The very best ones survive, often to endure criticism from more &quot;enlightened&quot; or &quot;sophisticated&quot; generations. (As if we really make quantum leaps in our development every 20 years or so.)Taken on its own terms, this is still a great piece of storytelling. The acting, writing and direction are all first rate. And the film, like the book, has a timeless theme --  survival -- that is embodied in an unforgettable heroine. Read the book first. It's a first-rate piece of fiction.

The movie centers around a woman, Scarlett O'Hara. Her life is depicted from when she was a young lady before the Civil War had begun to her entrance into womanhood after the war was over.  Besides the changes in Scarlett during this time, you can also see the changes in environment, civilization, social interactions, and American culture.  I like the way Margaret Mitchell adapted this parallelism in her book and am glad that got translated into the movie.  The title of the movie is ever so appropriate as the civilization that Scarlett knew growing up is forever ""gone with the wind"".  I would recommend this movie to everyone to watch as I consider it a true classic.  I also love the costume and set design!  The gowns Vivien Leigh worn in the movie are true masterpieces.  Walter Plunkett did an amazing job in their design.  The set design, from the burning of Atlanta scene to the amazing decor in Scarlett and Rhett's home is truly something to behold.  The set design and costume design came together in the infamous dress Scarlett wore made from her homestead Tara's curtains.  Those interested in the Civil War and history from that time period can also enjoy the historical elements of the movie.  The movie is long in length (3 hours 39 minutes), but an intermission is included that allows for a break in the action.  The music during the intermission allows the viewer time to ponder what has happened in the movie so far and think about what is yet to come.  The ending of the movie is the best cliffhanger of all times.  I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I have."	5.0	My Favorite Movie	2007-12-04	0	0	0

Seeing the movie again was really great and helpful.Thank you very much for helping me accomplish what I set out to do.Brenda	5.0	Gone with the Pounds	2013-05-21	1	0	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K	"brewster22 ""brewster22"""	I know &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; has been teased to death, and there seems to be a sort of snob appeal among the film critical community in denegrating this film as overblown Hollywood melodrama.  But the thing that impresses me about &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; after seeing it recently on the big screen is that it's one hell of a good movie.The entire first half moves with a propulsive energy that not many films can match.  Victor Fleming (billed as director, though there were at least four director names attached to the project) stages one sensational set piece after another, and hardly a scene goes by without a quotable line or a memorable image.The success of any adaptation of &quot;Wind&quot; is going to rely greatly on its Scarlett, and here I can't say enough about Vivien Leigh's performance.  I quite simply cannot imagine any other actress in this role, so perfectly does Ms. Leigh embody it.  She's in virtually every scene, but even after four hours of her, I'm not tired of her, and her ability to captivate the screen while she's on it doesn't lessen for an instant.Clark Gable is Clark Gable, perfect for his role as well and an able match for Leigh, but his performance plays as window dressing as compared to Leigh's powerhouse work.I also want to mention Olivia de Havilland.  In her own way, she is just as powerful in her role as Leigh is in Scarlett's.  Melanie's character is less dynamic and so by sheer necessity de Havilland is frequently upstaged by Leigh.  But she holds her own nonetheless.  And what struck me is the chemistry the two actresses have when on screen together.  The scene in which Scarlett attends a party dressed in bright red, braving the gossip she knows will attend her presence, and Melanie walks slowly forward, determined to prove herself a refined lady by welcoming Scarlett unconditionally, is a tour de force for both actresses.I take points away for some soap operatic elements in the second half that grind the story to a halt, but otherwise this film deserves its place as one of the greatest achievements in American cinematic history.Grade: A	4.0	Frankly, This Is One ...

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A9T5JCM30NVKY	Brian D. Rosner	"I would not dare to knock the greatness of the film ""Gone With The Wind"" The movie stands all by itself. There isn't one imperfection when it comes to the acting, production and beauty of the restored visual and audio presentation. I salivate over the anticipation of the blu-ray release.BUT... give me a break on the packaging and price tab of the box set. Most of the addition material has already been released. The  TBS mini series ""WHEN THE LION ROARED"" and the documentary ""1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year"" was just recently been released with the WIZARD OF OZ Blu-ray Collectors Set. Do we get a GWTW wrist watch also?Why do these companies always take advantage of consumers with taste. I think the movie is great but I would like the option of purchasing just the film for $25 and not the rest of the garbage for an additional $35. Would it be easier if I just sent Warner Bros. a blank check?"	2.0	Greatness vs. Marketing: Take my Wallet ... Please	2009-10-14	19	5	14

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ANHBKS4N4WG9V	"""britainkitten"""	Gone with the Wind is, in my mind, the best movie ever made... topping even Citizen Kane in cinematic genius, style, and direction. If you have read the book, like I did, you will not be disappointed. Mitchell's cruel and beautiful vixen, Scarlett O'Hara, and southern scoundrel, Rhett Butler, are both played brilliantly. Both Vivien Leigh and Clark Gabel make their finest performances in this film. Aside from a few minor changes, the film is very loyal to Margaret Mitchell's classic novel. The film tell's Mitchell's story of a world undone and lost forever by a war, of the struggle to preserve dignity and honor, and of love and misery. A dramatic, painfully sad, and yet beautiful film that should not be missed by anyone!	5.0	Brilliant... One of the Best Films Ever Made.	2001-12-02	3	3	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1GB0HW46Y2EB	Bruce G. Taylor	"""Gone With the Wind"" is probably the most remembered title in film history.  Warner Bros. released this 3 hour, 53 minute epic on a single Blu-ray disc in all of its Technicolor glory.  In addition to the great video clarity, we see it in its original 1.37:1 theatrical aspect ratio as opposed to the 1.33:1 ratio of the earlier DVD issue.  The video quality of this Blu-ray disc is generally fine, the audio not so good.  The dialogue track is generally subdued  and a little muffled sounding and the music track is very poor in quality, sounding somewhat ""watery"" and distorted.  Strangely this is not at all the case with the new Blu-ray of ""Rebecca,"" a film released a year after GWTW also by the Selznick studio. It's a pity more couldn't have been accomplished in sound restoration as it was with ""The Wizard of Oz."" A matte shot early in the film shows transparent riders and wagons driving up to the Tara mansion, surprisingly the work of William Cameron Menzies, considered at the time to be one of the best matte artists in the business.""Gone With the Wind"" has never been among my favorite films and I will sacrilegiously suggest that this story could stand to be remade although it probably never will be.  I was never impressed by Vivian Leigh's delivery of the part of Scarlett O'Hara which I found rushed and superficial.  I get the same feeling watching her portrayal of  Blanche DuBois in ""Streetcar."" By the second half of the picture you get the impression that many of the actors are just trying to get through it.  The performances of most of the African American actors are generally uncomplimentary to the Black race as was the custom in movies in those days.  My compliments go to Olivia de Havilland for some of the best acting in the picture -- a performance of real emotion and pathos.  Clark Gable is OK but looks and sounds exactly the same as he does in every  one of his other films.  He definitely does not come across as a man of his time in this film.  Leslie Howard, a very fine actor, was simply too old for the part of Ashley Wilkes and his British accent sometimes got in the way.  David Selznick was worried about Howard's age at the time and he was right to be worried. For me, the final hour of the film dissolves into pure soap-opera.The directing style(s) -- Selznick went through three directors for this film -- leave a lot to be desired.  The camera moving from one wounded soldier in the hospital to another delivering their lines on cue seems extremely artificial by today's standards of film making.  This style recurs in a few other scenes and becomes annoying.  The burning and escape from Atlanta is well done, but given today's techniques could be accomplished more convincingly now.There are several scenes that are photographically breathtaking which completely dispel the idea that older films do not benefit from being released in the Blu-ray format."	4.0	Blu-ray very nice -- film shows its age.	2012-03-26	4	3	1

The picture and sound is fantastic but I have a complaint about the way it is advertised. On the details about the movie there is an editorial review. I usually glance through this to make sure that I am getting a version of the movie that has &#34;behind the scenes&#34; features. That is actually what I thought i was getting with this purchase. Imagine my disappointment when I got this in the mail, racing to see the movie about the search for the perfect Scarlet and it is not there. I was upset and even debated about sending the movie back. I again went back to the detail page and discovered that the editorial was talking about the &#34;ultimate collectors edition with blue ray&#34;. It was my fault for not reading closer but I also wondered why that would be on a page for the Two disc 70th Anniversary Edition.

But, like rich chocolate, one must not overindulge or the tastebuds become jaded.Then we got our DVD player and in looking over the catalog of choices for 'must-own' movies: GWTW was an early winner!I'm glad to have this on DVD.  The picture quality is very sharp and finding a special scene so much easier on DVD.The movie, itself, needs no review from me.  It remains one of the most visually stunning movies about that period of our history that exists.  If I could do a &quot;dream cast&quot; and be capable of drawing from every actor, past and present, I cannot imagine making any cast changes. For EVERY principal player IS THE PERSON who they play.  I would, however make one addition to the cast.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1EP3ITG2ORK4Y	"c. bautista ""being_and_time"""	I practically know the dialogue by heart by now. Still, as God is my witness, I will always be moved by GWTW. Rhett Butler is still the epitome of masculine frailty, and Scarlett may seem a bit more irritating now, but one always hopes for the best, because tomorrow is...another day. And for those who think GWTW is too much stuck in old mores and dreams of southern lifestyle (which they're wrong), well, frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.Speciall effects? Well, 1939 effects don't exactly look spectacular today. One the other hand, the characters are so ingrained in our movie imagination that, like Sunset Boulevard, one must experience it to appreciate the building blocks of cinema. And, the music?

My memory was that she was also very selfish; and she was to a certain extent. But her determination and courage ensured the survival of many people as well. She was also so single-mindedly determined to have Ashley, that it took her forever to realize that she didn't really want him. It is really sad when people are attached to the idea so strongly that they can only be happy if or when that particular thing is in their lives; and aren't happy with what they have. She seemed so happily married to Rhett, and just threw it away. It was the first time my 16 year old daughter saw it, and she wasn't happy with the unsatisfying ending. It is absolutely amazing to think that this was filmed in 1939 and is still the most popular movie ever made. Hollywood is so remake happy.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ACXAVE1GVJPWO	"Charles Burch ""Eclectic Reader"""	'Gone With The Wind' has an iconic status that is matched by perhaps 'The Godfather' or 'The Wizard of Oz'. I hadn't seen it for at least 20 years, and I wondered how well it would transfer to Blu Ray.Technically the transfer is quite good. There are some interior scenes where there seems to be some detail lost in dark scenes, but the colors are lush and appropriate for the period.What shocked me after not seeing the film for so many years is how the blatant racism left me cold. I found it hard to really (to quote Rhett) 'give a damn' about most of the people in the movie. And as for lamenting the genteel and chivalrous lifestyle that was lost with the Antebellum south, I found it impossible to forget that it was all built on the backs of human beings that were treated little better than animals.About halfway through the movie, I started mentally comparing Margaret Mitchell to Dick Shawn's character Lorenzo St. Dubois, the author of the musical 'Springtime for Hitler' from Mel Brooks' 'The Producers'.Maybe it would be more fair to compare GWTW to 'Birth of a Nation'. It is a well-crafted movie. Clarke Gable WAS born to play Rhett Butler. Vivien Leigh plays the mercurial Scarlett with passion, although I find her character more and more unlikable as time goes by.To be clear, this is the same movie I enjoyed as a younger man. The movie hasn't changed, I have. I used to excuse Margaret Mead's vision as a product of rose-colored glasses, but now I see her portrayal as a great tragedy, because it was instrumental in helping define American misconceptions of the Antebellum South.	3.0	When fine wine turns to vinegar	2010-04-28	12	1	11

If you have not seen this movie, it is the one movie you must see. The color, the cinematography, the pastoral sets, the Burning of Atlanta the creative juxtaposing of scenes and characters; these are all integral parts of an American masterpiece. There are so many individual great scenes; wonderfully crafted and beautifully acted, the movie must be seen to be appreciated. If you appreciate American literature, or American history or just a damn good story this movie is for you. It spans the period before, during and after the greatest conflict in our nation's history. The magnitude of that epic struggle is vividly portrayed.

Halfway through the book, I started the movie which is the best movie of all time.The story follows Scarlett O'Hara, a young flirt, as the daughter of a plantation owner and the belle of every ball. Suddenly, the Civil War strikes and changes her world forever. She is thrust into situations she never dreamed possible, but sustains her courage and spirit throughout the entire movie, which is famous for its length.The acting is excellent, story perfect...I could go on and on listing the glories of ""Gone With the Wind."" Vivien Leigh is talented and beautiful and deserved her Best Actress Oscar that she recieved for playing Scarlett.I think that you wouldn't do yourself justice by watching the movie and never reading the book. The book is detailed and contains more information about the characters, war and story. For example, when Melanie and Scarlett donate their wedding rings to the Cause in the movie, Melanie gives her ring first. In the book, Scarlett puts her ring first, causing Melanie to see that Scarlett was so brave that she could do the same thing.The features-four documentaries, five trailers, coverage of a centennial, and more-are all well-done and packed with information about the story, the movie and the war.

When this movie was made in 1939 there was NO such thing as widescreen in theaters. Films were shot and released in the traditional 1.33:1 ratio, approxiately the same as a standard television screen.The film was re-released in the late 60s transfered onto 70mm film which had a wider format. To do so the original film had to be cropped at the top and bottom to fill the wider screen left and right. Getting the proper format, as on this DVD, you actually get all the original's photographic compositions.	5.0	No widescreen	2010-04-01	22	17	5

A spectacle to end all spectacles; the epitomy of costume, art direction, and cinemagraphic grandeur  (Technicolor film was still rare in the 1930's, and the industry was already engulfed in production of at least one *other* color movie that same year). I wasn't enthralled with this film when I first saw it years ago but I have come to appreciate its epic presentation and gothic, almost soapy, storytelling. And the cast is entirely first-rate, from the leading lady (whose historical casting was a mini-series in itself) to the supporting roles (Hattie McDaniel, Thomas Mitchell, Ona Munson, Laura Crews, Ann Rutherford, Harry Davenport, Oscar Polk, 'Superman's' George Reeves, et al) to the hundreds (thousands?) of extras who populated the pre-and-postwar South (the tracking shot of the Twelve Oaks mansion at the start of the barbecue and the sprawling, widening shot of Scarlett walking amidst all the wounded soldiers come to mind). It is a great script (""Waste always makes me angry;"" ""Do you ever shy away from marrying men you don't love?"") and great direction (Victor Fleming, George Cukor, and Sam Wood- anyone else?). It is a record-holder of sorts among Oscar nominated (or Oscars won) films, but it came out in an extraodrinary year of films. 1939 also saw the releases of, among others, GOODBYE MR.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AENI3U0Z7UJBH	Christine Lee	Words alone cannot describe the grandness, much less the greatness of this film. Even after 60 years, it's still as outstanding as ever it was.The story is based on the novel of the same title written by Margaret Mitchell. It's set amidst the impending American Civil War, when the Great South employed negro farm workers (slaves). Vivien Leigh portrays the main character Scarlett O'Hara, the eldest daughter of an Irish farmer. She's the prettiest girl in the county, and has all the men fawning over her. Well, all except the one she really wants. His name is Ashley Wilkes (played by Leslie Howard, who,oddly enough has an English accent wneh they're in the old South of America). But unfortunately he is already engaged to his cousin Melanie Hamilton, Scarlett is determined to get her man, going as far as marrying Melanie's brother Charles in a bizarre attempt to make Ashley jealous.Throughout the film, she cries over Ashley, ignoring the fact that her perfect man is already in her life. He is Rhett Butler (Clarke Gable), an older man from Charleston with a doubtful reputation which has seen him disowned by his own family. And he loves Scarlett in the way she deserves to be loved.The making of this film has a much more interesting plot: Clarke Gable and Vivien Leigh were said to have hated each other, the original director George Cukor was fired amidst rumours of his homosexuality, Vivien Leigh fought with his replacement who in turned treated her badly ( telling her to 'get your British arse out here').But all of that unpleasantness aside, this film is in a class all of it's own. It has it all: drama, romance, comedy, tragedy and action.	5.0	The very definition of 'great film'	2002-09-10	5	5	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3N95R1VKWROWF	Christopher Schwinger	This movie's popularity has never made sense to me.  It showed promise at the beginning because Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable have a funny way of unexpectedly meeting after she throws a book in the library in a temper tantrum.  But the whole movie is just unbelievably shallow in its theme.  I can't believe this is considered a masterpiece!!  First, its greatest claim to fame in its script is that it used the d word at the end.  Second, its greatest claim to fame in memorable action is the burning of Atlanta.  That was really dangerous and complicated and somewhat exciting, but not the kind of spectacle that I look forward to such as Peter O'Toole as Lawrence of Arabia charging on Aqaba or El Cid's final ride (AWESOME spectacle scenes).  The burning of Atlanta part doesn't matter unless the rest of the movie is also good, which is my third point:The theme is a big downer.  Scarlett, instead of changing into a better person over time, remains very selfish, and tragedies happen and Rhett comes and goes at different times.  She keeps longing to be married to Ashley Wilkes, played by Leslie Howard, even though he's already married, and the movie doesn't condemn her lust at all.  And at the end, when everyone has abandoned her because she's so selfish, including Rhett leaving in the mist, she desperately longs for hope and remembers what her father, Gerald O'Hara, said:  &#34;Land is all that lasts.&#34;  What comfort is that to a person?  It's just baffling to me that it was a big hit, and continues to be.Concerning characters, besides Thomas Mitchell as Gerald O'Hara, the only character I like a lot is Hattie McDaniel's character.  THIS movie ought to be gone with the wind, instead of being so acclaimed.  It has no ultimate romantic satisfaction, which is of course why it's considered a daring movie that broke the expectation of her and Rhett getting together, but the reason we HAVE that expectation is because it's more satisfying when that expectation is granted.  I would have liked the movie, even though it's so long, if three things were different:  1) she changed over time into a kind-hearted person and married Rhett (who also is selfish, by the way, and would need to change), 2) she didn't lust for Ashley Wilkes--by the way, an adulterous affair is implied, which I don't like at all, and 3) she didn't come to such a foundationless comfort at the end, of investing her life in the land.  The land is impersonal.  Why is it that mainstream movies, both then and now, are so afraid to include God as the Higher Power we can depend on?  Classic Hollywood, though more glamorous in its images than present-day Hollywood, is still as shallow as can be.There is one good thing that came out of this movie, and that's Max Steiner's music.  I like it a lot.I'll probably get almost exclusively negative votes on this, but I would appreciate dialoguing about this &#34;masterpiece&#34; instead of just being negatively voted, since a negative vote can just as easily mean &#34;I don't like your review and don't care about your reasons&#34;.	1.0	The minority voice - the theme and character qualities leave much to be desired.	2014-01-20	19	6	13

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A15IN5H4IATSHQ	Classic film buff	"Although Amazon already sports over 1,500 customer reviews, and I'm sure my title, the final line so resonantly uttered by Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara has been used before on at least one of them, I'm still going to forge ahead here.  An alternative title could be ""In Praise of Vivien Leigh"", since the lion's share of my review will be about this superlative actress who would have been 100 years old this November 5th.  In 1968, I was almost 14 when I first saw ""Gone With the Wind"", it had been rereleased late the year before, and was playing in a reserved seat presentation at the same first run theatre that I had seen ""The Sound of Music"" a few years before.  I had never heard of the film until in history class my teacher had mentioned it as one of the best cinema representations of the Civil War, one that had a memorable lead character Scarlett O'Hara. (""Scarlett""? What kind of a name is that?"" I thought and asked my teacher if it was ""Charlotte"", no she told me Scarlett it was.  She also assured the class this was one film that would NEVER wind up on television!  Little did she know with the advent of cable EVERYTHING would wind up on TV!)I was and still remain passionate about history, so since I valued my teacher's opinion I decided to see it, after first reading the massive novel, which I loved and devoured in one weekend!  Unfortunately none of my friends were all that interested in an ""old"" film, so I went solo.  As Max Steiner's renowned ""Tara's Theme"" soared majestically over the opening credits, I got a stab of recognition, ""Hey, it's the ""Million Dollar Movie"" theme from TV!""  Then, the opening scene unfolded on the porch of Tara, the O'Hara plantation with one of the Tarleton twins blocking the unseen Scarlett O'Hara momentarily. The camera panned in for a close-up, and there she was, the actress Vivien Leigh flashing a dazzling smile as she spoke Scarlett's first words, ""Fiddle dee dee, war, war, war, this war talk spoiling all the fun at every party this spring!""  I will borrow a quote from the late film critic Andrew Sarris to describe my immediate reaction ""And, ultimately, there is Vivien Leigh's smile on the screen like a sliver of sunlight piercing the heart.""  Yeah, got that right!  In that instant so began my love affair with Vivien Leigh on screen that continues to this day.At the film's conclusion with the indomitable Scarlett rising like a phoenix from the ashes of her life, I was thrilled, what a story, what a film, and what an actress!  ""Gone With the Wind"" remained my favorite film for many a year, I saw it another two times in theatres, this time with friends, and innumerable times on television, VHS and DVD.  It wasn't the sweep and spectacle that enthralled me and drew me back for repeated viewings, but rather the Scarlett O'Hara of Vivien Leigh.  To me, Scarlett O'Hara was and remains the most vivid, memorable film heroine in film history, thanks entirely to the incandescent brilliance of Vivien Leigh.  This was the perfect mating of character and actress, although such well known actresses as Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Norma Shearer, Margaret Sullavan and Miriam Hopkins were considered at one time or another, anyone else playing Scarlett is inconceivable.  One of the many wonderful extras in this set is an excellent documentary ""The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind"" where the screen tests of the four actress finalists for Scarlett are intercut with one another: Joan Bennett, Jean Arthur, Paulette Goddard and Vivien Leigh. They're fascinating to watch, and although only one of them is truly off kilter, a too old and modern Jean Arthur, Goddard and Bennett are swept away by Leigh's extraordinary grasp of the part. The viewer can see for him or herself that no other choice was possible.The only way that Vivien Leigh violates author Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara is in the famous opening line of the novel ""Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm...""  Ms. Leigh was one of the twentieth century's most beautiful actresses, and was never more exquisite than in this film.  Master cameraman Ernest Haller was partially responsible for this, but probably God and nature should get some credit as well.  Her costumes designed by the renowned film designer Walter Plunkett also assist her characterization, some of the more memorable being the white ruffled gown in the opening, the green sprigged muslin barbecue dress,  the low cut, feathered, claret colored ball gown, and of course most famous of all the green velvet drapery dress made out of Scarlett's mother's curtains.  But ultimately, the success rests on the slender shoulders of Ms. Leigh. She brings out all the many moods and nuances of the mercurial Scarlett, and doesn't flinch from showing some of her less desirable qualities, yet she does so without ever losing the sympathy of her audience.  What particularly distinguishes this portrayal is the wildness, passion and electricity, there is a fierce perhaps neurotic drive underneath, hidden currents that were I believe part of Ms. Leigh's own personality, besides the legendary poise, breeding and charm.  This is all the more remarkable in that she was just a couple of months past her twenty-fifth birthday when filming began.  Ms. Leigh's vibrant, radiant Scarlett brimming over with life is quite simply a work of screen art, and more than earned her Best Actress Academy Award and the New York Film Critics Award for Best Actress of 1939.Although Ms. Leigh's Scarlett is the linchpin of the film, I'd like to remember the ladies who provided such outstanding support starting with the Melanie Hamilton of Olivia de Havilland.  In less talented hands, the saintly Melanie could have come off as sugary sweet, instead of deeply moving at times. Right behind her are Hattie McDaniel as the bossy but loving martinet Mammy and Butterfly McQueen as the bird brained Prissy.  Ms. McDaniel would win the first Oscar awarded to an African American performer as Best Supporting Actress.  Ona Munson as Belle Watling, Barbara O'Neil as Ellen O'Hara, Evelyn Keyes and  Anne Rutherford as Scarlett's younger sisters Suellen and Careen are right on the money, as are Laura Hope Crews dithering Aunt Pittypat and Jane Darwell's dominating matron Mrs. Merriwether.With the exception of Clark Gable who is perfectly cast as the dashing, charismatic rogue, Rhett Butler, and shoots sparks in his scenes with Ms. Leigh, plus stretching himself as an actor in the latter part of the film, the rest of the males aren't all that memorable.  Leslie Howard in the thankless role of Ashley Wilkes is too old, pallid and dull to ever be attractive to the full of life Scarlett.  He didn't want to do the role, and it shows, the film is undermined whenever he appears.More than enough has been said about ""Gone With the Wind"" elsewhere, and the main purpose of my review was a tribute to Vivien Leigh one of my all-time favorite film actresses. Still I'd like to comment quickly on some of my favorites of the marvelous special features.  Heading the list is the aforementioned documentary""The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind"", if it only had the Scarlett screen tests, it would be worthwhile, there is so much more from costume and makeup tests of the principal players to the Oscar acceptance speeches of Vivien Leigh and Hattie McDaniel, it's well worth a look.  Next would be the 1990 TNT documentary ""Vivien Leigh: Scarlett and Beyond"" hosted by Jessica Lange which tries to capture the life of the elusive Ms. Leigh, and has some good clips and interviews.  There is an engaging reminiscence by a delightful Olivia de Havilland, the sole surviving principal called ""Melanie Remembers.""  Black and white newsreel footage of the original 1939 Atlanta world premiere, plus the 1961 Civil War Centennial Atlanta premiere provides interesting contrasts when you see how producer David O. Selznick, Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland have changed.  Film Historian Rudy Behmer gives a well-researched absorbing commentary, and last but by no means least a facsimile recreation of the original theatrical program used at the Atlanta premiere in 1939, which has essays by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable on their respective characters.  Just to clarify, this is the ""Four- Disc Collector's Edition"" that was issued in November 2004.To conclude, if you are one of the few that have never seen ""Gone With the Wind"" do, if you're like me a repeat viewer marvel anew at the evergreen freshness of the immortal Vivien Leigh in her most famous characterization, Scarlett O'Hara."	5.0	"""After all, tomorrow, is another day!"""	2013-09-22	1	0	1

It's very beautiful indeed and deserves 10 stars IMHO.BUT to list this with 233 minutes is wrong. Why is amazon.com not listing the entire amount of minutes that the customer enjoys on all 4 discs together? That would make more sense.The movie itself has about 3 hours 40 minutes if I remember it correctly plus several documentaries, so that alone should add up to more than 400 minutes at least.Why is it in these technologically advanced times still not possible to get the information you want?I started reading the 900+ reviews hoping one of the reviewers would disclose how many minutes total we are dealing with, but nobody seems to be interested in that kind of information.Well, I will watch all 4 discs and make notes about the length of each film or documentary and then I'll update here how many minutes are altogether on these 4 DVD's.Other special editions like ""Titanic"" even praise themselves for having 16 hours of extra material.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	"This would be arguably the best film made during the so-called ""golden years"" of Hollywood. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Margaret Mitchell, the film won 8 Oscars including Best Picture, Best adapted screenplay by Sidney Howard and Best Director, Vic Fleming, known more for his Oscar nomination as Best Director for the timeless, The Wizard of Oz.I dislike using this word, but Gone with the Wind is your `quintessential' American film & story. Set wholly in the Deep South just prior, during and after the Civil War, historically the movie seemed to capture the tone, attitudes, ambience and sentimentality of the time period. Gone with the Wind managed to harness that ""fighting spirit"" that culturally the United States is known for...in terms of never giving up and life's essential contradictory combination of ugliness and beauty. More so, however, the film is a love story, a tragic love story and our changing times.The last time seeing Gone with the Wind was by sheer fluke, playing at a small cinema across town. There is that captivating scene where Scarlett O'Hara (the beautiful Vivian Leigh) stands at the top of the winding staircase and sees for the first time, Rhett Butler, (Clarke Gable); the camera sweeps down the staircase for a close up at Gable's roguish smile, and still, after seventy years, the theatre filled with the sighs of women, young and old, over Clarke Gable's looks and charm - astonishing.Sidney Howard won Best adaptation screenplay that year, (1939) but after the film was made and he was nominated, died on his farm, his tractor falling upon him. Howard was the first writer to win an Oscar posthumously from the academy...a brilliant writer.There were many beautiful stars during the Golden Age but personally, Vivian Leigh as a child and now, so many years later, remains my ideal woman: feisty, strong, tragic and attractive till the end of her life. My other favourite role of Ms. Leigh's was in Tennessee Williams', A Street Car Named Desire, as another (tragic) character, Blanch...beautiful, extraordinary yet ultimately tragic.One cannot write about this film without mentioning ""mammy"" (Hattie McDaniel) the black house servant that stayed with Miss O'Hara through it all...Hattie was the first black American actress in American film history to be nominated and win the Oscar for Best supporting actress in Gone with the Wind. As a child, her character always made me wish that she would be a family member in our household...no pretension, say's what she feels and so caring.Although best viewed on the big screen, Gone with the Wind can be appreciated on DVD because it is that kind of timeless film that should never be forgotten."	5.0	One of the Best of Hollywood's Golden Time	2007-08-03	7	6	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1T17LMQABMBN5	CoffeeGurl	I watched Gone with the Wind for the first time when I was twelve years old.  Seventeen years later, this film continues to captivate me.  The four-disc DVD collector's edition is a wonderful investment because the special features are few of the best I've seen.  But it is still the story that I love the most.  Even though I like Margaret Mitchell's novel better than its film adaptation, this is one of the best adaptations I've seen.  Scarlett O'Hara is still one of the most complex protagonists ever written and portrayed, and Rhett Butler remains to be one of the most appealing rogues in literature and in film.  I fell in love with Clark Gable when I saw this film and Vivien Leigh brought the wonderful (anti) heroine to life.  Hattie McDaniel as the loyal, puts-the-heroine-in-her-place Mammy is also a great actress who brings this appealing character to life.  This is one of the best Civil War stories I've read and watched.  I feel the time period was at times sugarcoated and romanticized, for the war was much worse and slaves were treated with far more severity than shown here, but the film is fairly accurate given that it was released in 1939.  The backdrop of the war, the period costumes and scenery are still few of the best I've seen.  So, if you love Gone with the Wind as much as I do, then you will want to add this four-disc edition to your DVD collection.  This is one of the best investments I've made!	5.0	An awesome, must-have edition of a classic!	2006-01-15	7	6	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3OFI66YECEUHM	Connie Pelley	Gone with the Wind is a classic epic that can be enjoyed by any audience.  The movie is based on a book by Margaret Mitchell which is set in the old South.I don't think that the parts could have been cast any better.  Vivien Leigh, while not well known in the United States did an admirable job with the part of Scarlett O'Hara.  She was willful, pouting, yet also showed a strength and determination.  Rhett was attracted to Scarlett and wanted her love, but he wasn't about to allow Scarlett to railroad him like she had so many others.It starts out with Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) doing whatever she can to be the center of attention.  She has decided that she is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), but soon finds out that Ashley has asked Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland) to be his wife.  Scarlett has a conversation with her father (Thomas Mitchell) and he tells her that he will leave his plantation to her.  She isn't interested and tells him.  He informs her that land is worth fighting and dying for and that with Irish blood she will find that this is true for herself, too.  This sets the stage for the rest of the movie.At a barbecue at Ashley Wilkes house, Scarlett tells Ashley that she loves him.  He lets her know that even though he cares for her, they would not make a good match.  He is much better matched with Melanie.  Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) overhears the conversation and lets Scarlett know before she leaves the room.  Before the day is over, the war is announced and plans are made for the men to leave.  Melanie's brother, Charles Hamilton, is smitten with Scarlett and asks her to marry him.  She tells him yes and they wed before he leaves for war.  It isn't long before Charles dies of pneumonia while in the service.This story is really about the clashes that occur between two extremely strong willed people.  The film continues with constant interchanges between Rhett and Scarlett and the challenges that they must undergo with the war.  Scarlett must take care of her sister-in-law while Ashley goes back to war.  Scarlett helps out as a nurse in the war effort.  The epic continues with Scarlett and Rhett gradually building a relationship, albeit a rocky one.Scarlett is left in Atlanta to take care of Melanie, who is pregnant.  Scarlett finds the strength, along with Prissy (Butterfly McQueen) to take care of her in her time of need.  She always managed to do what was needed regardless of the cost.The performances are unforgettable.	5.0	A Classic Epic	2005-03-27	8	4	4

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AJ6BQLFSZ8RUA	"D. A Campbell ""IronHillsDan"""	"Gone with the Wind, is of course, often rated as the greatest movie in American film history, so there is no need to reivew the qualities of the actual movie. But with two discs, I was expecting at the very least a nice ""making of"" feature. However, the only extra feature here is a film historian doing a talk-over, if you select that option. But that's it.The first fan review posted onAmazon (with about 150 ""helpful"" ratings) talks about all the extras that coime with it. But on subsequent reading, I see that he is talking about a four-disc set, not this 2-disc version. This is, of course, totally misleading, and I blame Amazon for posting it on the 2-disc listing. Indeed, I am thinking about demanding my money back because of that. As to the technical achievement of this version, the picture quality is impressive, but I cannot agree about the sound quality being good. Like so many old movies on DVD, I have to keep the volume control close at hand so as to pump up the volume for any semi-quiet dialog, which is usually very bass-y and muffled sounding. Then, of course, the loud parts blast you off the couch, requiring a downward adjustment."	2.0	Virtually No Extras on 2-disc set	2011-02-20	5	1	4

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A27J55NYP8L644	dagoj@online.no	I think this movie is over-rated. The actors and actresses are over-playing their roles - even if you know it's a 1939-movie. The story is a typical American love-story with a dialog made for the simple-minded. The  presentation of the glorious South before, during and after the civil war,  was, in my opinion, a lecture in historical desinformation. I watched it  for the third time after bying it as a DVD, and I was very disappointed  when I really studied the story and the dialog: it's both naiv and filled  with banalities. Why is it still so popular in the US? Well, maybe it has  something to do with the Americans dreaming of the glorious past - that is  never coming back again.	3.0	What's the classic part?	1999-03-06	6	0	6

Hawkins	Whenever I watch &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; I always try to imagine what people in 1939 watching it for the very first time must have thought of it.  Sound had only been prevalent in movies for only ten years or so.  Full-color was very rare (1937's &quot;A Star is Born&quot; and &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&quot; are earlier examples, as is 1939's &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;).  And this wasn't just color, this was absolutely magnificent.  I'm more impressed with the technicolor in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; than I am by movies made today.  No wonder this film has been viewed in theaters by more people over the years than any other film in history.Besides the film's technical merits and its pure spectacle, it is also a very moving drama about compelling characters.  Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh give wonderful performances.  This film is a national treasure and cannot be recommended highly enough.	5.0	The grandest movie of all time	2001-01-24	7	5	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2DVO5YBI2DX10	Danim	"Gone with the Wind is a great movie. I loved the chemistry between the actors and the scenery was great. The movie did cut out a few minor character from the book like a few of Scarlet's children. Other than that nothing else was really changed from the book to the movie (which is very rare nowadays in Hollywood). The movie is about 4 hours long as would be expected from a +1k page book. The plot I felt moved a little quickly and without prior reading of the novel(ITS GREAT) you may be thrown around if you don't pay exact attention. The author used facial signals and eyes mostly to convey emotions and since there isn't a narrator in the movie all of that detail is ""gone with the wind."" All in all the movie was great and I do recommend it, however one bummer about this disk is there isn't behind the scenes obviously since the movie is so old. The only extra on the disk is to watch the movie on mute while a historian describes each actors bio from scene to scene. It was a bit of a snooze and I didnt make it very far. Buy this movie!

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2SJU6MCH3HBEL	Danny	I can't believe the American Film Institute would even dare mention this film in the same sentence as The Godfather, Casablanca, or Citizen Kane, which are all superior films. This movie was just plain and simple BORING.  I give it 2 stars because of the costumes and production design. It held my  attention for maybe the first hour but then just dragged off. And I don't  have a short attention span if that's what you're thinking, which I'm sure  fans of this movie who are reading this review are. I don't see the  difference between this and any other one of those sappy romantic movies  where they constantly soften the lens when focusing on the leading lady's  face. Casablanca is a much better movie and is a helluva lot more romantic.  All Scarlett does in this movie is complain, complain, complain. If I were  Clark Gable, I would have laughed when she fell down the steps. The worst  part is that the lousy twists in this movie go on for nearly 4 hours. Ugh.  I should have rented this one first before I bought it. I'm still kicking  myself. I suggest you don't make the same mistake I did and at least wait  for it to come on TV first.	2.0	BORING!	2000-02-11	22	3	19

This is arguably the best film of all time and if you doubt it... you've either have poor taste or been living under a rock. This film came out in 1939... about the time the last Civil War Vets were dying of old age, and the Civil War was relatively ""fresh"" in the country's mind. Old wounds die hard.I just watched this DVD version. Two main things: 1) When we think of this of this we imagine some epic classic movie, yet we forget how witty and funny this film can be at times. Mostly from the interactions between Rhett and Scarlett. The facial expressions and quick quips from Scarlett are priceless. 2) This DVD would have gotten 5 stars, but I was a bit disappointed with the special features that usually come with all DVDs. There really wasn't much there. They should have included some type of documentary of the making of the film and interviews from Leigh and Gable.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A239PPUVV8O0U0	D. A. Reed	Like Wizard of Oz, I'm at a loss for words on what to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. It's up there with Oz as one of the most referenced, quoted, parodied (Carol Burnett) and homaged films of all time. The story's great and, again like Oz, one of these days I'll get around to actually reading it. The cast is outstanding, especially the two leads. Scarlett possesses some of the worst character traits; she's greedy, self-centered and vain (I'm not sure if those last two count as the same thing). But she is also a very strong female character. The way she's able to run Tara and practically rebuild her home with her mother dieing and her father becoming senile. And, even though she marries for the second time to carry out her own ends, she still had good intentions so that her family could stay on their land. Scarlett also doesn't really care what society thinks of her as she discards almost all customs deemed lady-like at the time, such as owning and running a business. Vivien Leigh conveys all of that very well and I'm glad she was the one chosen to portray her (as much as I love Lucy, I'd have a very hard time picturing her as this type of character). Out of all the characters who suffer, I feel bad for Scarlett, who learns her lesson too little too late, Rhett for having to deal with all of Scarlett's crap and losing his daughter and Melanie for being the only one to feel genuine sympathy and love towards the woman who would easily try and steal her husband away. I feel no sympathy for Ashley, except for at the end when Melanie dies. He's clearly devoted to her, but constantly says he loves Scarlett. I know it's probably just to please her and to shut her up for a minute but he's easily one of the weakest male characters I've seen. The house staff, especially Mammy, are wonderful and funny but I can't stand Prissy! Why couldn't she get left in Atlanta during the invasion? Mammy is a great character and, despite being a slave, is more of a mother figure to Scarlett than her own mother.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1OM5269E8J401	"Darryl M. Haase ""dothehucklebuck"""	Selznick-International was one of the first independent movie studios in the 1930's, which makes &quot;GWTW&quot; one of the earliest and most successful independent films.  Selznick eventually needed help from his Father in-law Louis B. Mayer which explains why MGM had the rights to the film after Selznick went defunct in the 1940's.  &quot;GWTW&quot; is certainly Hollywood's greatest pageant, a feast for the eyes and ears.  Martin Scorcese said that films of old Hollywood still have a way of lighting up that fantasy part of our brains, and he is right.  It's cinematic theatricality at its very best.  The film sags a bit post-intermission, and becomes less dramatic history and more soap opera, but that's what happens when you try to cram a 1000+ page book into a nearly 4 hour film.  The only recent film to come close to &quot;GWTW's&quot; sweep and romance is &quot;Titanic&quot;.The DVD print is good, but the DVD is sorely in need of more extras:  there are no interviews, only one trailer, and no screen tests.  Perhaps a future DVD could contain that great 1990 documentary by Turner, &quot;The Making of GWTW&quot; narrated by Christopher Plummer.	5.0	AN EARLY INDIE-FILM FROM THE 30's!	2001-12-22	7	5	2

But after Georgia's in shambles and Scarlett vowes to smear her stankiest excrement over everyone if that's what it takes to avoid hunger, this story lags and drags. She does make a compelling anti-hero, but only to a point. The hours go by, the interest goes bye-bye.While there are some memorable zingers, a lot of the dialog is silly, the sets often look fake (especially the skies), and Gable honestly wasn't in top form.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A27FR2C67JPDRS	Daryl B	I've seen this film several times and I never get tired of watching it.  From the brilliant colors and set designs to the characters and costumes, this movie has lost none of what makes it a classic.  Vivien Leigh was perfect for the role of Scarlet O'Hara, taking the character from a spoiled youth to a woman, who through war and death, has seen the grimmer aspects of life.  Leigh, with those incredible eyes and with wonderful facial expressions is hypnotic through out.  Clark Gable, Hattie McDaniel, and Olivia De Havilland perfectly play the roles of Rhett, Mammy, and Melanie but it is Leigh that is really the star of this film.  Ashley portrayed by Leslie Howard has always been a character that annoyed me and makes me wonder what Scarlet ever saw in him. You may have to put your politically correct views aside to see the film but by watching it, you will realize what a cinematic classic it really is.	5.0	A brilliant film	2002-02-07	8	5	3

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2MW0RYIXMEYGS	Dave	"Why is it that most movie ""classics"" that are cheered and applauded today turn out to be incredibly lousy?I purchased Gone With The Wind on DVD for my mom nearly a year ago, but it wasn't until this September that we were able to sit down and watch it. And perhaps I've been spoiled by such epics as ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Spider-Man"", but I simply did not find Gone with the Wind enjoyable at all. No, it wasn't simply because there wasn't epic battles or superhero combat, but because the story itself was not entertaining.THE PLOT: Scarlet O'Hara is a southern belle lady living in the lap of luxury with her mother, father, and two sisters on a plantation named Tara. She is the envy of all the ladies, and the desire of all the men. Yet she has her heart fixed on one specific individual, Ashley Wilkes. She is devastated to learn at a party that her Ashley has given his heart to another woman, Melanie. At the same party, famed philanderer and charmer Rhett Butler sees Scarlet and falls in love with her.Meantime, rumors of war are troubling the South. It is rumored that the Union Yankees are readying efforts of war against the South to free the slaves and defeat the Rebels. Celebration comes when it is confirmed that war is abound, and every man able rides to sign up. To get back at Ashley, Scarlet pledges marriage to a young man about to go into battle, but he later dies.Long story made short, they all fight a big war, lots of people killed. Ashley goes off to war, and leaves a pregnant wife in Scarlet's care. Scarlet must attempt to birth the baby in the midst of a huge battle. Rhett manages to come to her aid, but then deserts her to join the army, ashamed of his previous attitude of ""only in it for the money"" service for the South. Scarlet makes her way home to Tara, and finds her beloved home devastated by war. Her mother dead, her father half-crazy with grief, and the possessions stolen by the Yankees. The rest of the doggone tale is spent chronicling Scarlet's plucky and spirited attempts to save her house, and make true her pledge never to be hungry again, as well as her reckless lifestyle post-war.GOOD: Well, I know I SHOULD be able to find good in this movie, but I'm sorry! It's just that where I come from, we're used to having the main character or characters be GOOD. I can definitely say the acting is good, the music is good, and the scale on which this movie was made certainly reflects excellent quality.BAD: Scarlet is a self-centered idiot who doesn't care who she hurts as long as she gets her way. She callously marries a soldier who is killed in battle, and then despises her mourning clothes she must wear after that. She finally casts off her false mourning to dance with Rhett. She marries another man her sister was in love with, simply to get his money so she can pay off massive taxes on Tara. She stupidly clings to a love for Ashley despite his marriage to Melanie. Interestingly enough, when we are first introduced to Rhett Butler, he's a renown scoundrel, yet even his heart is saddened by the war, and moved by love. Yet Scarlet seems to obtain Rhett's attitude of ""only in it for the money"". Aside from the morally bankrupt characters, the movie over all is not a positive, upbeat film one might enjoy watching. Death, bloodshed, and violence pervade the film. Did all this stuff happen? Of course! Is it being reclusive and callous not to want to concentrate on all the evils that took place in the Civil War? I think not.THOUGHTS: There is something about this movie that seems to attract fans, despite being fraught with spiteful, cruel characters. Perhaps it is the massive scale on which the movie is shot. There is no question the cinematography is very well done. The music is gorgeous. The acting is commendable. The clothes are a reason often touted when I ask with genuine curiosity ""WHY did you like this movie?"" But I still must raise objections to good acting, music, and cinematography all surrounding a bunch of 1800's jerks. You decide. I personally was disappointed to recognize the actor playing Ashley Wilkes as the actor who had previously starred in an ancient TV serial of Sherlock Holmes. The man was perfect for the role, and carried it out brilliantly, so to see him as the sniveling Rebel soldier was almost sad for me.I've gotten my main point across, but being as this movie is a genuine classic, I don't doubt most of you will want to buy it. If you do, you'll probably prefer the DVD. *Note* The DVD contains hardly any extras: Theatrical trailer, and a few quizzes.I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars."	1.0	Dramatic wartime love story, or miserable lives magnified?	2003-10-24	64	11	53
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AIMGHPI1AGVRF	Davewise	"This was one of many classics I had never seen until recently. Fortunately, I found the movie lived up to the lofty expectations set by seeing it so high on ""greatest movie"" lists time and time again. It is an epic movie that still has a personal side, thanks to wonderfully written characters and great acting. The movie maintains an epic feel due to the large sets such as a Southern plantation before the Civil War and the aftermath of Sherman's march through Atlanta. Even 70+ years after the movie's release, the blu-ray version maintains picture quality to properly display the gorgeous cinematography and vivid colors of the sets and costumes.A wonderful cast of characters is lead by the beautiful, resourceful, and strong Scarlett. Vivien Leigh is stunning and supplies the role with all the energy needed and then some. It's easy to sympathize with her plight much of the time, as many others become dependent on her during and after the war. Some may call her selfish, but I don't think she was looking out for her self-interests any more than anyone else. Her biggest flaw was her persistence in keeping a flame going for Ashley Wilkes after he marries her friend. I couldn't quite see why she wanted Ashley so badly, but without this plot line the movie would've been missing some of the personal strife. Clark Gable was very charming and convincing as Rhett Butler, the rogue who pursues Scarlett. As the dark hero who is at times deserving of praise and others deserving of scorn, he is a very interesting character and a worthy complement to Scarlett.Much of the peril, such as the war and its toll on life and land, is expressed in personal terms which are easy to sympathize with. Scarlett loses friends and family in the war; afterwards, she fights to maintain her family's plantation using any means necessary. The movie is great because these characters feel so real even against the epic backdrop."	5.0	First time viewing of a 70+ year-old classic	2011-11-14	4	3	1
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	"It's ""Gone With the Wind"".  I don't think I should have to write a review about this movie.  Everyone knows how remarkable this is.  I should only have to say, ""it's 'Gone With the Wind'.  Need I say more?"" ...""Gone With the Wind"" is said by many to be the best film ever released.  It rightfully won ten Oscars in 1939, including Best Picture.  This emotional love story is based on Margaret Mitchell's novel of the same name, which was published in 1936.  The screenplay adaptation for this film is brilliant.  The writing is just one detail out of many that makes the film so remarkable.  It desplicts Scarlett O'Hara's battles in life and love.  The love story between Rhett Butler and she has yet to be matched by another film.  Its detailed and deep theme offers the unforgettable experience.  O'Hara's struggles during the Civil War, including losing her first husband, offer a more expanded visit into her life.  Her struggles after the war offers a more climatic theme all the way to the conclusion.  Such intense emotion and deep storyline, which is never held back for a second, always keep the audience's attention.The elaborate setting and costume design are flawless.  The artists' research of the 1800's styles is obvious.  Every detail is accurate to the times.  Such elaboration was never heard of in 1930's cinema.  No other filmmaker at that time emplanted such difficult effort.  Much of what is seen looks more realistic than a lot of modern-day movies.  The cost of making this film: if inflation is included, it totals more than the current record holder ""Titanic"", $200 million.  That money was well spent.Vivian Leigh performed her role of Scarlett O'Hara beautifully.  She deservingly earned an Oscar for Best Actress for what many call the best performance in her career.  Her every drop of heart and soul went through her character.  Her character's happiness, love, greed, and life trials are desplicted by her wonderfully.  Clark Gable performed his role of Rhett Butler brilliantly.  His character's rough image blends perfectly with his soft loving image due to his efforts.  Leigh and Gable describe in this film why their legendary status is at the level it is.  All other actors, major or minor, also performed their roles beautifully.  The war times, the war effects, the love, the jealousy, and everything else never fall below their fullest capabilities.""Gone With the Wind"" is sure to please audiences of all kinds.  This masterpiece will remain a classic until human extinction.  After watching this DVD, those that like it should also watch the film facts and the theatrical trailer, which offer more interesting insights of how the film was created and its surrounding history."	5.0	The Best Movie Ever Made	2004-01-17	7	5	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1D5WG289X5GVE	David B. Young	Nice set.  Comes with lots of extra printed materials worthy of the huge box and high price.  The video on the Blu-ray itself is a nice improvement over the DVD.  Not so much in terms of clarity, as the DVD did fine.  But mostly in color fidelity.For all Warner's work before, there remained a noticeable flicker of color.  Each frame looked good, because they worked frame by frame.  But the color would darken and lighten and change slightly over the course of several frames, then back again.  Simply look at the opening scene with Scarlet's white dress out on the porch on the DVD.  Watch as the bright white changes to pink, then green, then back to white.  Very subtle, but it happens.  That effect has always disturbed me while watching a film.  I have noticed it on other Warner Brothers movies like Ben-Hur.  This is why I prefer the type of computerized restoration done by Lowry Digital (recently changed to DTS Images or something) rather than the frame by frame work Warners does.  They do an outstanding job, but don't take into account the changes from frame to frame.Anyway, that effect is minimal here on the Blu-ray, and to see it at all, you have to watch very closely for it.  Thanks Warner Brothers!  Now I can watch the film itself rather than just seeing rainbows and storm clouds.The sound is about as clear as it could ever be for a 70 year old film.  Good work.I gave a 4 star rating rather than 5, because my box was broken on arrival.  One corner was torn.  So I feel compelled to point that out.  Also, I like the movie, but I don't love it.  It appeals to my wife more than to me.  So 4 stars.	4.0	Nice upgrade from DVD	2010-06-27	2	2	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2NTNBBPYRUS3P	David Kimel	"Gone With the Wind needs no apology. Not only is the ""Saga of Scarlett"" one of the most sumptuous and beloved films to date, it takes its place in cinematic history as the single most popular film of all time in terms of number of tickets sold, and all time box office champion when its earnings are adjusted for inflation. Popularity, of course, does not determine artistic merit, yet GWTW is in fact remarkable precisely because it is such a consummate work of art. The film is a captivating exercise in storytelling that refuses to lose its momentum after over three hours in the theatre. Although the focus of GWTW's sentimentality has become poltically incorrect, the heart of the film is stunningly timeless. The very qualities which enable Scarlett to survive the Civil War and flourish in its aftermath, (her selfish determination, her single-minded obstinacy, her willingness to flout traditional social values), are in fact the very self-destructive aspects of her character which lead to the dissolution of her marriage with Rhett Butler. The audience is subsequently presented with an age-old tragic formula in which one's greatest virtues become their own worst enemies, and the acceptance of responsibility comes just a moment too late. This Aristotelian facet to GWTW unites both halves of the movie, (due to this unity, I have never understood complaints that the second half of the film is inferior to the first), and is set within a thrilling framework of astronomic production values. There is an honesty to GWTW, a freshness bound to its lack of naivete. Scenes of amputations, abusive marriages and cynical passions instill it with a stubborn modernity. Scarlett O'Hara wading through a sea of corpses at the depot, her defiant shadow set against the backdrop of Tara, the burning of Atlanta, Rhett Butler disappearing into the mist, all of these images have ingrained themselves into the American psyche. And of course, Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel deliver some of the finest, nuanced performances ever set down on film. Because Gone With the Wind is a work of genius, (and, like all great art, as immortal as it is controversial), I could not bring myself to rate this DVD less than five stars. HOWEVER, the transfer leaves much to be desired. Picture and sound quality are tolerable, but the most unforgivable thing is the total lack of extras. There is a vertitable cult associated with the making of Gone With the Wind, and a wealth of material fans would be thrilled to explore- who would not enjoy looking over old screentests for the role of Scarlett, secret letters passed between producers, ""lost scenes"" and abandoned concepts? However, all of these treasures are left out, and the viewer is reduced to praying that one day, a DVD will be released with the appropriate extras. That day has yet to come, (and I suspect the studio hotshots don't give a damn), but with the film's 65th anniversary looming on the horizon, perhaps tomorrow is another day."	5.0	Mediocre DVD of a Hollywood Classic	2002-09-24	1	1	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2KG8WLR1AKO12	"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator"""	"David O. Selznick's 1939 ""Gone with the Wind"" is a great movie.  The production qualities alone far surpass the standards of that long ago era.  It was filmed in color, a very expensive and difficult process.  The advanced sound quality brought an incomparable realism to the screen.  ""Gone with the Wind"" is admittedly not a meticulous historical study. Martha Mitchell's novel turned to film, though, did highlight the cocky attitude of the agrarian South before it entered into war with the North.  There is one early scene that demands our rapt attention.  Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) is conversing with some Confederate lads who think that a victory over the hated Yankees will be quick and easy.  Not so, says the more realistic Butler.  The industrial North is far wealthier and has a larger population of men to send into battle.  A fight almost erupts between Rhett Butler and a hotheaded youth who is enraged that he does not also share their reckless confidence.  The latter's mind-set clearly dominated the thinking of the South's male leaders who couldn't begin to imagine the horror that imminently lay ahead.""Gone with the Wind"" is built around the self-centered and pampered Scarlett O'Hara.  In many ways this aristocratic beauty is a feminist before her time.  She is a woman who knows how to deal with the male chauvinists of the business world.  She may not have the right to vote, but politicians sit up and take notice of this brash southern belle.  Unfortunately,  Scarlett's selfishness and mean spirited manipulation of everyone around her is outrageous.  Vivien Leigh is superb as a woman deserving of our contempt.  She loves Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but has lost him to another woman.  Scarlett goes through a number of wealthy men before marrying Rhett Butler.  He adores her, but Scarlett barely gives him the time of day.  We view their efforts to conquer adversity and hardship in both the ante and postbellum South.  Will they be able to save the Georgian family plantation, Tara?  Can they do so and still remain halfway moral and civilized?The movie's racist overtones cannot be ignored.  They are fortunately nowhere as vile as the evil masterpiece ""Birth of the Nation.""  The earlier D.W. Griffith's 1915 production blatantly presented the Ku Klux Klan in a positive light, and portrayed blacks as deceitful and less than fully human.  ""Gone with the Wind"" only indirectly referred to a Klan type group as the savior of the alleged beleaguered white establishment. Hattie McDaniel received an Academy Award for her supporting actresss role as the servant, Mammy.  She earned this honor for portraying a black woman who has no real life of her own.  Mammy's existential purpose is to give of herself totally to the whims and caprices of her white masters.  ""Gone with the Wind"" deserves a five star rating.  Nonetheless, increasingly it is not merely a magnificent work of art---it is also a stark reminder of how far America has progressed in the last sixty three years."	5.0	"""Gone with the Wind's"" racism detracts from its greatness"	2002-02-27	12	4	8

In my opinion the movie has one flaw, it  is a bit too long and yet still doesn't cover some aspects of the book. The  movie has some of the greatest camers shots ever filmed.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	A great work takes time, and oftentimes a lot of headaches, as was definitely the case in creating one of History's most notable films.But eventually, everything fell into to place in recreating the world of Civil-War plagued Georgia that Margaret Mitchell described in her only novel.Academy Award Winning British actress, Vivian Leigh captures the description of the determined and manipulative green-eyed Scarlett O'Hara to the hilt; this is less of the case with Clark Gable's interpretation of Rhett Butler, who has everything but the dark eyes of Mitchell's Alpha-Male, but makes up for what he lacks physically with a definite charisma.The ill-fated future portrayer of Superman, George Reeves, plays a red-haired Stuart Tarleton, and Fred Crane plays his twin brother, Brent, who Scarlett entertain at her family's plantation,Tara.Olivia de Havilland fits the description of Melanie Wilkes perfectly, with her brown eyes, demure manner, and heart-shaped face, although well beyond the age of young Ashley Wilkes, Leslie Howard's performance reflects the gentle, dream-laden nature of the man Scarlett pursues, and Alicia Rhett, through a wardobe of mostly earth tones, accurately depicts the plainness of his sister, India.Three directors(Sam Wood,George Cuckor, and finally Victor Flemming) helped produce this vision of the old South.A few scriptwriters came and went before Sidney Howard's version got the final nod. Its draws viewers because of its color and spectacle, magnificent costumes,exquisite details of costumes, jewelry, mannerisms, and various articles found in homes of the wealthy, and an intrepid view of a serene and bucholic life of lazy days of security before calm turned to chaos.We follow Scarlett through her initial flirtation with the doomed Tarleton Twins, a scolding from Mammy(Academy Award Winner, Hattie McDaniel)about not inviting them to stay for supper, and Scarlett's upset over the news that Ashley is to marry Melanie.Barbara O'Neill and Thomas Mitchell portray Scarlett's parents, Ellen and Gerald. From one, Scarlett gets an unfavorable confirmation of Ashley's engagement, and the other, an example of calm, kindness and serenity that life will not enable her to follow.Ann Rutherford, and Evelyn Keys portray her sisters, Carreen and Sue Ellen, Butterfly McQueen and Oscar Polk are house servants, Prissy and Pork, and we observe the irony of slaveholders at prayer and thinking nothing of it.Censorship codes of the time do not allow us to see the full reality of the treatment of slaves, but in certain ways, Prissy and Everett Brown's Field Foreman Big Sam, let viewers in on the subtle and not-so-subtle tactics slaves used to survive.We follow the characters through their time at the Wilkes' barbecue at Twelve Oaks where Scarlett is surrounded by scores of suitors, to the consternation of other young ladies there.All three of her future husbands(Rand Brooks, Carroll Nye, and Gable)are at this gathering as well.Amid a failed attempt to win Ashley (of which a hidden Rhett catches wind), and men rushing off to enlist with the Confederate Army(despite Rhett's warnings against their chances of winning), Scarlett begins her ill-thought marriage to Melanie's Brother, Charles Hamilton( Brooks), which ends within months due to his death from illness on the battlefield.The film omits her having had a son from this breif union but focuses on her time with flighty Aunt Pittypat(Laura Hope Crews), with whom the now-married Ashley and Melanie will be staying in Atlanta, and her scandalously joining the dance at the Monster Ball benefitting the troops when Rhett invites her to join.Soon, she joins Dr. Meade(Harry Davenport) in nursing soldiers, as does Melanie, who accepts money for the hospital from Ona Munson's red-haired, over-the-top looking Madame, Belle Watling when others, including Mrs. Meade(Leona Roberts) refuse her money.Encountering a group of slaves hired to dig ditches for the Confederacy, Scarlett learns from Big Sam that her mother is ill, and tries to go home.But a pregnant Melanie goes into labor, and with no doctors available, only Scarlett and Prissy(who complicates things) are left to help Melanie deliver her son,Beau, as Aunt Pittypat has fled the house with servant Uncle Peter(Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson).Prissy is sent to find Rhett, who is at Belle Watling's establishment, and secure his assistance in helping Scarlett, Melanie, Beau, and herself flee the house before the Yankees march in and burn it.He does so, and halfway through a perilous journey, he abandons them to enlist in the Confederate Army.Making her way home across profound devastation, she finds Twelve Oaks, the Wilkes' plantation burned, Melanie's father-in-law, John(Howard C. Hickman)dead and buried, and a cow wandering about. The cow escorts them to the still-standing Tara.But the land and house were looted by the Yankees, Gerald O' Hara is white-haired, grim-looking and non-compos mentis, his younger daughters are ailing upstairs, and his wife is dead.Scarlett soon vows to live through this ordeal and prosper.The second half of the film finds the remaining O'Haras tending to the land themselves since most of their slaves either ran away or went to fight.Scarlett shoots an intruding deserter from the Union Army(Paul Hurst) and with the still-recovering Melanie's help, covers up the deed.Melanie encourages Scarlett to take money from his napsack, which will be used to buy food.Determined to keep her home, even in the face of high taxation, she wards off Victor Jory's Jonas Wilkerson, the O'Hara's  scandal-filled overseer-turned carpetbagger, and his new wife Emmy Slattery(Isabel Jewell), when they come to make an offer for it, resulting in an unexpected tragedy.Wearing a dress made from from old drapes that very much compliments her emerald eyes, she makes an unsuccessful attempt to obtain tax money from the incarcerated Rhett, but soon meets up with Sue Ellen's beau Frank Kennedy(Nye), and seeing the potential success of his business, she marries him him amid Sue Ellen's devastation, and thus acquires the money to keep Tara.Scarlett involves both Ashley and Frank in the lumber business they start, using the forced labor of convicts, and incuring the wrath and gossip of Mrs. Meade, India, and Mrs. Dolly Merriweather(Jane Darwell). After nearly being attacked while driving through a shantytown, the men in her life go to confront her attackers.  A Yankee Captain (Ward Bond) waits at the Wilkes House for them to return as the ladies assemble at the Wilkes for the evening.When the men return home, there is more tragic news for Scarlett.Eventually Rhett marries her, and their life together, is lavish, passionate, and dysfunctional. A daughter named Bonnie(Kelly Griffin, Phyllis Douglas, and finally, Cammie King Conlon) is born to the couple, and she will have much of her mother's spunk and defiance.Had the film's  budget allowed, it would have been interesting to see the portrayal of characters such as Archie the hillbilly, Will Benteen, the servant, Dilcey, and Scarlett's two children from her first two marriages, Wade, and Ella.For all her ability to face and deal with life harshest realities, there is still one reality that Scarlett remains reluctant to face for much of the story. Her eventual acceptance of that reality  will put life in another perspective for her and amid more devastation, send this iron-willed beauty, who has lived twelve lifetimes in only 28 years, home to start all over again.	5.0	Film's Paean to Literature's Most Famous Southern Belle	2011-04-22	7	1	6

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2WO1D49PBO90P	"""delila30"""	This is the classic Hollywood when there were talented actors, carefully written dialogues and no technical effects. Vivien Leigh is superb and so is Olivia de Havilland. For Clark Gable, well, as Margareth Mitchell said she wrote the character for him, thinking of him, so no surprise there. This is a great love story with striking main and supportive characters and a real war theme behind. The character Scarlet has set the perfect example for wicked seducer beautiful witty manhunter heroines thereafter. However, after the war she transforms into more than that-she becomes the bold, strong, ambitious, independent carreer woman who goes after what she wants no matter how the society judges her. And the character Rhett is her perfect mate, smart, masculine and almost always supporting Scarlet on her way. The movie is a very successful adaptation of the book, leaving no disappointment. The missing star is for the DVD, as there should be more about making of the movie-this is a disappointment	4.0	One of the greatest movie of all times-average DVD	2003-10-24	1	1	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2RZI8UTUBLB0A	Derek Hartley	The Warners transfer is beautiful. After years of viewing on TV or on home video, finally seeing it on a high quality digital TV with progressive scan DVD, the movie looks brand new. The film has been lovingly restored, and unlike other older films I have watched on my high end TV, this film doesn't suffer for the added scrutiny and detail.My only minor irritations are with some of the bonus features. The bios of the minor players in the film were interesting, but oddly incomplete, with only movies from their now-Turner-owned studios even mentioned. It made the bios feel short-changed and too much like an ad for other movies available on Warner Home Video. Additionally, the new interview with Olivia deHavilland, the only major player still living, was stiff, formal and unenlightening. Also, a documentary on her life would have been great to see, especially since it was her Supreme Court case that ended the notorious seven year contracts which in turn helped end the studio system as we know it. Not that her fey prank on Clark Gable wasn't charming, but there could have been more to it. That being said, the meat and potatoes for me is always the picture and this time, they got the picture right. It looks amazing.	5.0	Excellent Collection with minor flaws	2005-01-03	5	2	3

The picture and sound quality are so good the movie looks like it was made within the last 10 years!!!  The restoration has brought out clarity in the smallest of details most noticeably in the views of the on-set backdrops which were used on the soundstages.  Although you can tell they were backdrops, the artwork and detail are amazing.  This was when movies were made as a HANDS ON process with crew members using paint brushes, hammers and nails, much like the theatre of the day, but on a far larger scale.  Also, the matte paintings of the woods in which Scarlett meets her father at the movie's beginning has been color corrected, and the woods where Big Sam saves Scarlett from the scavengers is seen for the first time in all it's matte painted glory!!!  Fantastic!!!  Just compare the 1999 DVD release to this one and you will see what I mean.  The extras are great- what more can I say?

Simply stated, the film is what it is: a magnificent relic.  Scattershot, pedantic nattering about the film is just boring, especially when it comes from an uninformed point of view which includes, among other things, the notion that a wide-screen version of this film exists, and for some reason was not used on this DVD.  (Actually, MGM did release a ""70mm"" version in 1967 which cropped out the top and the bottom of the original frame, but that doesn't qualify as ""wide-screen"".)  The film is about as realistic as ""The Lord of the Rings"" and about as relevant as any bodice-ripping romance novel at the grocery store checkout: get over it.

But also is an excellent film with an excellent story and excellent characters. Margaret Mitchell's story is perfect for the screen due in part for the tremendous effort that producer David O. Selznick put into doing it. Also, one of the standouts of the film is the cast. All the characters were perfectly cast with excellent actors that gave for me their finest permormance in this picture. Clark Gable is outstanding as Rhett Butler as is Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, Olivia de Havilland as Melanie Hamilton, Hattie McDaniel as Mammy, Butterfly McQueen as Prissy and more. The only character I don't like is Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes not because he act bad but because I hate Ashley. Aside from that is a story that never feels old and I can watch it again and again (doesn't bother me its running time. A perfect classic and a masterpiece.This set is marvelous, it has 5 discs with the film completely restored (for the ones that own the 2004 edition I have to tell you that this edition has improved picture and sound, of course is not a drastic change and I don't think is worth the upgrade) and excellent bonus material.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A351LB8UWBKS06	"D. Paul Dalton ""DPD"""	"I do hope you'll return and revise your rating to a '5' once you digest this information:Gone With the Wind was never released in a Widescreen version on DVD because it was never released in a Widescreen version on film.  In fact, when it was released (1939), there were NO ""Widescreen"" movies at all -- becaues no one had yet thought about formatting movies in that way.Through the 1940s and into the 1950s, essentially ALL movies were in the 3:4 format that we now consider to be ""regular"".  My understanding is that those proportions originally were adopted by the film industry to roughly correspond with the proportions of viewable area for the ""live"" theaters extant when the film industry started.  Similarly, when television arrived in the late 40s/early 50s, its screen format  was determined by copying the 3:4 screen proportions of films made up to that time.  By the mid-1950s, the film industry became concerned about losing its audience to TV, so various WIDESCREEN formats (CinemaScope was one; I think there was another called VistaVision; I can't remember the others offhand) were conceived by the film industry in the 1950s as a way in which the film industry could distinguish its film products from what could efficiently be shown on television screens.  This was the film industry's attempt to keep audiences coming to theaters to see their movies, rather than just waiting to see movie productions on home televisions; by coming to the theater, the audience could experience something different that what television could offer.Other ""ideas"" in this effort against TV included attempts to interest audiences in 3D films, as well as enhancing film audio, both by greatly improving sound range and fidelity and later by  adding stereo, at a time when TVs had only a single, inexpensive speaker that didn't sound all that ""hot.""  In fact, the creation/addition of 5.1 audio (Surround Sound) was yet another film industry effort to distinguish itself from what then was available for use in homes.Anyway, if someone now wants to issue a ""Widescreen"" version of GWTW, the only way to do it (without distorting the content) would be to cut off the top and/or bottom of every frame all the way through -- just think about how THAT would look . . ."	5.0	"Technical Consideration for ""Bewildered in Iowa"""	2004-11-30	268	236	32

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A145EDBZDAYY7L	DR	Gone with the Wind is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made. Its a masterpiece on all levels of production: the acting is first rate, the epic story is breathtaking and awe inspiring, the cinematography and the depth of detail is extraordinary and the production values are astounding.Vivien Leigh stars as Scarlett O'Hara, a young girl living with her family on their southern cotton plantation, Tara. She is desperately in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), an attraction which proves hopeless when it is announced that he is to wed his cousin, Melanie Daniels (Olivia de Havilland).At a party at the Wilkes', she tells Ashley of her love for him but is spurned. Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), who has overheard their conversation, takes a fancy to Scarlett and makes a pass at her. She turns him down however, still obsessed with Ashley and painfully jealous of Melanie.Apart from all this, Scarlett's life is perfect. However, the outbreak of the American Civil War throws everything into chaos and changes her family life and that of the whole country forever.The film charts Scarlett's life from her early teenage years up until her adult life, charting her adventures in Georgia during the horrific attacks on the town as well as her reclaiming Tara after the war and her marriage to Rhett Butler. It also vividly chronicles the American Civil War in horrific detail, at one point depicting the massive scale of injuries as Scarlett tends to wounded soldiers.A magnificent epic that seduces, shocks, thrills, inspires and uplifts, the film won eight Academy Awards - including Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for Hattie McDaniels' hilarious performance as Mammy, Scarlett's maid - and is an absolute classic. A must see for everyone!	5.0	One of the Greatest Motion Pictures in the History of Cinema	2008-02-18	2	1	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AZ1TQBTRGPYDU	"D. S. Falco ""Garyella"""	I have finally bought GWTW on DVD some twenty-five years after reading the book and seeing the film first--and falling in love with both forever. I am not American, so to me all the issues of race, history, war, etc. were just like a novel: fiction, and perceived like fiction, with all empathy.I took in the entire story with the perception of someone who had not lived in the States, had no notions of slavery or what the Civil War meant more than in theory, as a lesson of history, and saw in it just this: ONE enduring story about humanity.Just like Shakespeare, Margaret Mitchell has managed to create (basing her story on historic facts) a very real fictional world in which real fictional people are: good and bad, strong and weak, or wicked and honest; they love and hate and die, kill and give birth, have passions and dreams that are shattered... There is nothing new under the sun, as the Ecclesiastes says--except maybe in the ways and shapes and colours of the world, and the new ways mankind keeps finding to kill itself.The difference between Gone with the Wind then and (let us say) Shawshank Redemption (another one of my favourites on my Top 10 list) lies in the timelines, and who the main characters are, and what their lives are like, and is there a war or not... But there is always life and death, and love and passion, and it always depends on HOW we see these happen--this is why GWTW is so great...	5.0	An all-time Top 10 classic	2006-07-05	5	4	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A35J4XGRWXVZ00	Edward	Recently I looked up in Amazon.com the customer reviews for Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. There were 308. Next I looked up the customer reviews for Antoine Franois Pr&eacute;vost's 1732 novel &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;. There were 2. Here's the point: 200 years ago the Abb&eacute; Pr&eacute;vosts's book was as tremendously popular, as universally famaliar as Miss Mitchell's novel has been in the second half of the 20th Century. I suspect that, as &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; is today primarily known through the operatic versions of Massenet and Puccini, by the end of the 21st Century &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; may well be known to the masses primarily through the cinematic version of David O Selznick. That's why it's important that the film be evaluated on its own terms. Is &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; a great film? Well, it is permanently absorbing and entertaining (in the elevated sense) like any true work of art, be it the Iliad or Beethoven's Ninth. The story of a spoiled Southern belle living through the horrors of Civil War and the shame of Occupation is still sharply relevant. Read today's news stories. Released at the beginning of World War II in 1939, the annus mirabilis of Hollywood, &quot;GWTW&quot; is certainly the opus mirabilis of that year of wonders. Large, colorful, richly romantic,it is the apogee of Hollywood professionalism. It does not really do much for the auteur theory: at least three directors worked on it. Victor Fleming gets screen credit, though there are cin&eacute;asts who think the movie would have been greater had it been completed by its original director George Cukor. But I think this is first and foremost a producer's picture. Every aspect, from the graceful winding of the Twelve Oaks staircase to the famous crane shot of the tragic train depot, says &quot;Selznick&quot;. Even Max Steiner's iconic score seems to have been controlled by the producer. The cast, of course, is legendary. Vivien Leigh was the perfect actress to play Scarlett O'Hara. A shrewd woman who realizes she is living in a man's world, Scarlett can be a purring kitten one minute and a snarling tiger the next. Miss Leigh handles both sides with conviction. In Rhett Butler, Clark Gable found the role that might have been written for him. Actually, I've always suspected Miss Mitchell had Gable in mind when she created Captain Butler. The tempestuous relationship between Scarlett and Rhett provides the screen with a sensually cynical dissonance. The scene where Rhett finally proposes to Scarlett -- she's drunk, he's sardonic, wearing a sprig from her late husband's funeral wreath -- is fairly shocking, much more so than the marital abduction up the Atlanta mansion's staircase and Scarlett's morning-after humming. (There is evidently a theory about the leitmotif of staircases in Sidney Howard's screenplay.) Olivia deHavilland is courageously bland as Melanie Hamilton. Her carriage meeting with Belle Watling (the wonderfully garish Ona Munson) is one of the movie's most poignant scenes. The only flaw in the casting is Leslie Howard, much too old to portray Ashley Wilkes. With all the hoopla over finding the right woman to play Scarlett, Selznick couldn't find an appropriate young actor to fill such an important role? The oddest casting is Eddie Anderson as the white-haired, doddering Uncle Peter. In fact, Eddie Anderson was several years younger than Gable. Moving serenely through the whole story is Hattie McDaniel as the bossy but benign Mammy. It is a great tribute to the Academy that she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Vivien Leigh's Scarlett won Best Actress, and the production itself won Best Picture. This is not a kids' picture. This is not a &quot;date movie&quot;. This is an adult adventure about conflict on several levels, and as such ... yes, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a great film.	5.0	The Blue and the Gray and Scarlett	2000-11-19	13	10	3

The scenery is also well suited for the DVD format, and scenes such as the wounded in Atlanta are truly brought to new light.I do think it is interesting that they still leave in the intermission on these old movies.  I realize they are part of the film, but it is still kind of funny.  At least with the DVD version, you can easily skip this.

Everyone was perfectly cast, with the exception of Vivien Leigh.  If I were casting &quot;Gone With The Wind,&quot; I would not have cast Vivien Leigh.  There was something lacking in Leigh's performance.  There were two actresses at least, that I am aware of, who were seriously being considered for the role.  One of them was Paulette Goddard and the other was Bette Davis.  Paulette Goddard, an outstanding actress, would have made a far more beautiful and believable Scarlett than Vivien Leigh, and, while Bette Davis was stunning rather than beautiful, she would have ripped the screen apart with her acting.  I would have cast Bette Davis.	5.0	THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!	2000-12-27	9	2	7
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A13GXLD69NWU2O	Eric A. Gottung	"""Gone with the Wind"" is hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time, and not without reason I am sure, as it was not only a great drama, but a pivotal and exciting technical breakthrough.  But the question when labeling a great movie is not only how much it resonates with old audiences and how it looks in the film history text book but how it resonates with audiences throughout time.  As the 1900s progressed and social and political viewpoints became exponentially more liberal, ""Gone with the Wind"", the grand product that it is, feels in many ways - just as putrid and despicable as it doe great and epic.  Its racism is explicit, its philosophical outlook pessimistic, its romance unromantic.  Scarlett O hara, no doubt one of the great screen talents and beauties, plays a character who is thouroughly and utterly despicable, so much so that her last screen revelation that she actually loved Clark Gent after all, feels forced and unbelievable.  Her attitude as a woman is courageous and admirable, but her attitude as a person is so wretched that no last dramatic lines could possibly redeem it.  Take note that the movie suggests she still does not know who she loves by the end, as her last revelation is from the words of Ashley...""The answer is Tara."""	4.0	Great - Revelatory - A must see?  simply No.	2007-07-31	10	2	8

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2VFEPMEE0QEHN	"""evildevil"""	Gone With the Wind is a classical movie of the 1939's, the theme is about of the civilization of the south and their peaceful life style. A life of a rural plantation life that is trying to survive and protect their culture against the evils of the industrial revolution and enjoy life of luxury without the pollution of the industrial machines and their riff raffs; the history and the view that the south portrays in this movie is all about what they gained and lost because of the civil war and reconstruction. Of course the portrayal is not a 100% historically accurate and the movie downplay to mention too much about the cruelty of slavery and how the racial discrimination, which was lowly presented (lets be serious 1939, lack of cultural understanding makes sense not many would dare to talk about it in the silver screen), was view by the free blacks and slaves of the south that had to endure for many years before the idea of freedom was accepted and before the civil rights movements, but yes it is there, not bad neither nice. One of the problems with the movie if that it focus on the lost of the glorious south but doesn't mention or fully explains the consequences of such life style, the price of slavery and plantation life and how it happened or how all the issue of slavery and anti-slavery began; it lacks explanation of slavery, the good and the bad sides of it (when you study history you notice this things) to fully educate the public, that the issue of slavery is a human issue and that the southerners and the northerners are guilty of it because they were too human and too ignorant of our modern views (they cannot be blamed but that is not justification for anyone), maybe is me but I love historical accuracy in movies. This movie is a good (but not the best) portrayal of the south's point of view, it will differs with the north's or with any ones but given the understandings of how the southerners view slavery, not because of arrogance or ignorance but because of the lack of cultural understanding and modern enlightenment. For anyone who wants to know more about slavery one should read &quot;The Wages of Whiteness&quot; by David R. Roediger to know why white southerners (and also northerners, no one is innocent) lacked common sense about slavery and the faults of their ancestors and first settlers, a deeper understanding of white identity and the disasters that followed by 'psychological wage', also there is a lack of understanding of the house servants and their important central role in plantation life which is not fully explained in the movie, their role are important that is why I recommend reading &quot;Ar'n't I a Woman?&quot; by Deborah Gray White and read the chapter about Mammies. I don't blame the south's slavery issue; one who studies the past must not blame but understand without pointing the finger; the issue of slavery was not the south's problem but also an issue of the north, it was a national issue which is not view or explain in the movie. I think is time to look hard and beyond the lines and words and find the issue of slavery was not a state or individual or social fault but a historical and cultural issue waiting to become a ugly issue in American history but there are also interesting things one can learn about slavery and the human will if is willing to open and carefully look. The movie is a good tool to understand the south's life style and what they were trying to protect, the Jeffersonian ideals of a agricultural economy and private property, but the explanation is only half backed, for those who want to learn more look at these books that I mentioned.	3.0	It is a good movie about the south's point of view but...	2001-11-19	5	1	4
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ASIEGG17K1UID	"Ex-Buyer ""Thomas"""	"This is regarding the 70th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray. We know the story, so we will not dwell. Warner Bros owns (thanks to Ted Turner) most of the back catalog of MGM. Warner Bros is always the worse on Blu-Ray conversion of older movies in terms of sight + sound.  I feel my equipment is more than adequate...a 40"" VIZIO HD Flat Screen, an Oppo Blue Ray/SACD player with all current and future features and a Bose sound system to push it all through.  First of the picture....DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE SLIDES ON THIS PAGE...the picture quality looks nothing like that. I have always written off people who claim to see a ""grainy"" quality to the picture.  This is the first time on any Blu-Ray or DVD I can say it is grainy. The picture is not crystal clear and sharp as on any other Blu Ray or even a higher quality DVD that I own.  Many have complained about a yellow cast..this is more than evident.  Despite trying to adjust color, there is a strong undercurrent of yellow which permeates the entire movie disc (not noticeable on the other discs). So watching this for 2.5 hours with a strong yellow tone makes one become sallow as well. Second the sound.  I find that True HD has much less ""oomph"" than does Master Audio or even Dolby. However in this case, the audio on either True HD setting or Dolby setting is almost non-existent.  I had to crank up the Bose to almost 70 on the volume setting (on a total of 100) and it was still barely audible.  I tried another Blu-ray and Dvd on that setting and it almost blew the speakers apart...so it is the GWTW disc that is the issue. Also, at the setting you also begin to get a ""hum"", so now it is a bit listenable but you also have a ""hum"" coming through the speakers.Warner Bros, I have found is horrible on its DVD/Blu Rays. More often than not, they place all the settings and special features options AFTER you view the DVD/Blu Ray, so it is almost impossible to program the type of ""sound"" you wish to hear, or if you want to watch any special features, you are out of luck because, again, it is listed after you watch the movie. In the GWTW 5 disc set, ALL the special features are on the separate discs...which not only look better but also sound better than the actual movie.I am almost tempted in buying this in regular DVD to see if it is any better.  One of the all time great classic movies and Warner's has destroyed the sound and picture through inferior transfer and remastering. Such a disappointment.Oh yeah, he leaves Scarlet at the end."	2.0	Warner Bros is the WORSE regarding Blu-Ray	2013-07-29	2	0	2

The addition of the monumental 2-hour documentary ""Gone With The Wind: The Making of a Legend"", is a must see for any film buff, and certainly indispensable to any GWTW fan.  All the other features are certainly worth having, as well, although I would have appreciated more examples of before/after moments of the film during the short documentary explaining the restoration process.The film, itself, is impeccably restored, and looks better than the movie ever did in 1939.  However, anyone who already has the 1998 DVD release, and are looking for a more up to date remastering may be disappointed.  After some careful A/B comparisons between the two DVD releases, I can see virtually no change in the film, in print or sound.  If any further improvements were done, they are very marginal and undetectable to the naked eye and ear.This, of course, doesn't alter my enthusiasm for this release.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1LTKJ9UTZ9NVI	Filmaholics Anyonymous	What you get with Gone With The Wind is a majestic, sweeping love story about two terrible people who might never actually be in love with each other. They are simply two terrible human beings who can see each other for who they really are. Possibly a lovely metaphor for the American Civil War, which makes for a breathtaking backdrop for the melodrama, the North attempts to make sense of and satisfy the south, to keep this union together, but in the end, the North frankly doesn't give a damn anymore. An incredible film booming with insatiable ideas. Gone With The Wind is easily the greatest film ever made. I have seen thousands upon thousands of films, and I can honestly tell you that Gone With The Wind is the best there is. Easily.Gone With The Wind may have had three different directors working on the film, but make no mistake about it, Gone With The Wind is a film by the great David O. Selznick and no one else. Now usually a producer-made film falls flat, but I feel as though the films Selznick produced are golden and, more often than not, far more representative of Selznick himself than the interchangeable directors. There are only a very few amount of producers and movie moguls that I would call artistic 'geniuses', and Mr. Selznick is definitely one of them. His drive and determination, his passions and artistic sensibilities, sets him apart from the pack. I know I'm alone in this, but I still feel that Hitchcock's best work was done in collaboration with Selznick. Maybe it was the fact that Selznick truly was a collaborator and an artist at heart that makes his films so different. As shrewd as he may have been, I wish there were more producers like him. I honestly think he should have been given co-directing credits for at least half of his films. Several of them are clearly porducer-made, and in a very wonderful way as far as I'm concerned. I've been reading his infamous memos, the sprawling and obsessive 'notes' that he would leave his directors. They are incredible. Selznick bet the shop with Gone With The Wind and won.The film stars Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara. To say that their performances are merely iconic would be underselling the truth, Gable and Leigh have proven themselves to be among the immortals. When you watch Gone With The Wind, they literally bring their characters to life. In an act that defies the very concept of time and aging, Gable and Leigh prove to be transcendentally  absolute. Three and a half hours isn't enough time, I would spend entire days with these undesirables if I could. Their 'love story' is the greatest spectacle ever showcased. They are the archetypes for all future Hollywood romances. They are fiercely entertaining, and equally wowing. By God, I could talk about the faults and victories of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara for days on end. And I would.Leslie Howard receives third billing as Ashley Wilkes. In perhaps the most reserved performance in the film, Howards leaves a startling impression on the viewer nonetheless as the embodiment of the chivalrous Old South. Leslie Howard was one of the finest actors to ever grace the screen, and although I feel that his best performance can be found in the 1936 gangster film The Petrified Forest, the work he did in Gone With The Wind is still extraordinary and mostly unsung. A wonderfully patient performance from an extremely talented gentleman.Olivia de Havilland's performance, on the other hand, cannot be praised enough. The most soulful and heartfelt element of the film is her, and the most beautiful and heartbreaking concepts of Gone With The Wind are communicated by her. Most people feel that it is the 'love' between Scarlett and Rhett that is the romantic center of the film, I disagree almost entirely. There is very little actual love in the damned romance of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, whereas Olivia de Havilland's Melanie Hamilton is the personification of love's honor, courage, and plight, and serves as the true romantic center of Gone With The Wind. A beautiful performance by an even more beautiful actress.And of course, the film itself looks gorgeous. Arguably the most lovingly made spectacle of the '30s, the film is technically astonishing and it spoils its audience with wonder, goes above and beyond in terms of catering to them. Gone With The Wind is one of those films that stays with you forever, certain ideas fester and linger forever, the film hooks you in. Grandiose and immaculate, Gone With The Wind is the ultimate film goer's gift. Selznick gave the world to us, a world, a functional utopia bustling with life and excitement. I could never thank David O. Selznick for this film. Gone With The Wind changed the world forever, but more importantly, Gone With The Wind changed me. I will never look at films the same way again.	5.0	Tara! Tara! Tara!	2013-06-12	3	0	3
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2KB0Z0Q3XVRJP	fishbola	"I must admit, I was skeptical about Gone with Wind.  It is such an iconic movie.  Afterall, I'm familiar with many scenes, outgrowths that seem to possess lives of their own, like snatches of famous poems, or passages of well-known music.  But watched it I did, one Saturday evening, and I was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, it is beautiful and there are passing nods to the cruelties of slavery, war, being a woman, the southern condition, hunger etc. but you already know that there are other superior treatments of these subjects elsewhere.  The romantic core of the movie involves the m&eacute;nage a trois of Gable, Leigh and Howard as they manipulate and deceive themselves and each other in the name of love over a span of many years.  ""We live on love"" as they say.  The gestures are grand, over-the-top and the characters mythic, made for the wide-screen. It is in the end, a film begging to be an opera.  Under this fancy, Rhet would be a baritone, Scarlett, a soprano and Ashley a tenor with a mezza-soprano playing the self-sacrificing Melly.  Once you've superimposed the structure of opera on Gone with the Wind, it fulfills on a different level. Selznick himself seemed to have planted this allusion in the movie by slipping in the mysterious Overtures and Intermission scenes. Next time you watch or rewatch this film, bring your virtual opera glasses,  ""...tomorrow is another day"" - indeed."	4.0	Gone with the Wind as Opera	2005-07-26	2	2	0

The Hollywood of the `30's and `40's are as historic as the time of which this film elaborates as ""another time and place that will never be again.""  Of all the ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Star Wars,"" and ""Harry Potters"" that have come and gone, no film has yet to measure up to the grandure and heartfelt appeal as this literary film icon.  Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara doesn't even make Premiere magazines' list of the Top 100 Most Unforgettable Performances.  Nor does Clarke Gables' masterful performance as the roguish Rhett Butler, or Olivia de Havillands' sweet and inspired Melanie Hamilton Wilkes.  And who could ever forget the wonderful portrayal of the lovable Mammy by the first African-American woman to receive an academy award for her performance, Hattie McDaniels?  I don't know of very many people who have not seen this film, some criticize its' length and scoff at it's portrayal of the Old South.  Others, feel as I do, that it's one of the most beautifully told stories which happens in one of America's most darkest times in history, and features a dream cast that makes it all both heartfelt and inspiring.  I highly recommend ""Gone With The Wind"" for it's incredible story telling power and the ability to entertain beyond anything I have seen or will probably ever see again.

As a measure of just how good this is, despite it being very close to 70 years old and despite it being almost 4 hours long, I found myself thoroughly enjoying this from start to finish without ever being conscious of the time except when I had to flip the disc over at the intermission.  I was captivated by the backgrounds, the sets, the costumes and especially of the very, very good acting by all the cast which seems to be a lost art these days.The video quality was also very impressive given the very well done digital remastering that they did on it as well as on the sound which comes in both the original mono and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround.  I can only wonder what the Blu-Ray version would be like!  There are no real special features to speak about except for the thearetical trailers though but I guess as far as one disc restored and remastered versions go, this is a very good dvd.This movie deserved every one of its 10 Oscars and so long as the cream keeps on rising to the top, this film will remain a classic to be enjoyed for many, many more years to come.Highly recommended!	5.0	A True Classic That Entertains Even 70 years later!	2008-03-04	1	1	0
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1R6KGK8TRJAGV	"Free Thinker ""Amazon made me remove my blog s..."	"I can't begin to list all of the reasons I hate this film.  One would be the way it glorifies a southern past that never existed.Sure, life was reasonably pleasant, provided you were rich and white.  For poor whites and for blacks, living in the old south was short, brutal and hellishly hot.  Romanticizing that period of time makes as much sense as making a movie glorifying the Nazi regime's ""golden years.""Then there was Scarlett, whose only talent was sleeping with men who had money.  No talent, no virtue, no redeeming qualities whatsoever, just an appetite and the willingness to do any man with a few dollars in his pocket.Ah, but most disgusting of all was the portrayal of the slaves, blissfully content in their lives of menial labor and sorrowful at the approach of the northern armies that would liberate them.I've heard defenders of this piece of drivel say that it shouldn't be judged by modern standards.  That's a silly argument that assumes that black inferiority, acceptance of slavery and sleeping your way to the top were accepted values in the 1930s.  They weren't, except in such enlightened corners of the world as Jackson, Mississippi and Selma, Alabama.Shallow, sickening and juvenile, GWTW should itself be carried away by a cleansing wind into the dustbin of history.BTW, I'm an Atlanta native and a lifelong southerner.  I've done the historical research.  So you can't dismiss me as an ignorant Yankee."	1.0	I wish this film really was gone with the wind	2011-09-25	47	6	41

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3GA09FYFKL4EY	Fruit Loop	"A landmark in its time, and still the highest grossing movie of all time if you allow number of moviegoers per ticket prices today, ""Gone With the Wind"" is still an epic saga. As another reviewer points out, it may seem stereotyped, but this is actually about as close as it gets to an accurate view of the American Antebellum South. Listen to Ashley Wilkes' speech at Twelve Oaks and you get the REAL reason most men fought in the war: it was their home. ""If Georgia fights, I go with her.""Relive the era of time gone by, the fabulous costumes and beautiful sets, and superb performances by some of Hollywood's legends.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A238ZEO67Y7JFJ	Garry M.	This is a fine example of Hollywood old style movie making, an epic set during the Civil War era.  The cast is perfect and the costumes/sets immerse you in that era.  I also reviewed the novel and noted that Mitchell saw Blacks as inferior beings so her novel reflects this attitude.  The movie softens this part somewhat, although my British friend didn't understand why one of the slave would fight with the South.  They should have left out that part.  It's also interesting to see that sexuality mores affected the script.  In the novel Scarlett had children with each of her 3 husbands.  In the movie she only has children with Rhett.  The novel also portrays Scarlett as a questionable mother as her son is scared of her and Rhett notices her maternal flaws.Still it is a movie that should keep people entertained through this next century.  No doubt it will endure for at least another 30 years.	4.0	Still a must see movie	2006-05-28	4	3	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	"In the years since it debuted, GONE WITH THE WIND has taken a beating from film critics and historians alike.  The characters are often described as cardboard-ish; portions of the film are described as excessively melodramatic; some of the special effects (most notably the film's occasional use of rear-view projections) have dated.  There is some truth to all of these comments, but by far the most serious accusation hurled at the film is that it is racist.One's perception of the film as racist rather depends on whether you look at the film within the context of its era or from a purely modern standpoint.  At the time, GONE WITH THE WIND was a major advance in the portrayal of blacks on screen, for the two major black characters--Mammy and Prissy--are a far cry from the obnoxious ""Stepin Fetchit"" stereotypes so common in the 1930s.  In later years, both Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen would be derrided for their participation in the film and accused of perpetuating stereotypes, but in fact their performances were anything but stereotypical at the time--indeed, their very power led Hollywood into a repetition of similar characters, and it was that repetition that later caused the originals to read as cliched.The real problem with GONE WITH THE WIND is that it, like the novel on which it is based, buys into the myth of great plantations, lovely Southern belles, gallant gentlemen, and a paternalistic form of slavery.  These concepts have some basis in fact, but the vast majority of southern whites did not own plantations, much less own slaves, and those who did rarely practiced ""paternalistic"" slavery by any stretch of the imagination.  But GONE WITH THE WIND is the myth, not the fact--and once we accept it as a highly romanticized vision of the South as it never really was, the film becomes incredibly entertaining and can still cast its spell upon the modern viewer.The most powerful thing about the film is that it moves.  Over the course of its very long run, the episodic story of the beautiful and willful Scarlett O'Hara and her rapacious drive to insulate herself from the hardships of the war never significantly drags.  And the cast, from the leads to the bit players, is superior.Margaret Michell might have created Rhett Butler with Clark Gable in mind; Vivien Leigh, a remarkable beauty and a very fine actress, was scarcely known outside England--but amazingly, when one considers the tremendous anticipation surrounding the casting of the role, she plays Scarlett with incredible success.  Granted that the characters of Melanie and Ashley are rather unbelievable, but both Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard carry them off with conviction.  And although they have already been mentioned, Hattie McDaniel's formidable Mammy and Butterfly McQueen's passive-aggressive and frequently hysterical Prissy are brilliant creations and more than worthy of a second mention.True, advances in cinema technique have made some of the special effects seem dated, but the production values and art design are brilliant from throughout, and the film offers a multitude of iconographic moments: Rhett standing at the bottom of the staircase at Twelve Oaks; Scarlett caught up in a the panic during the seige of Atlanta; the tattered flag waving above the fallen troops at the train yard; the kiss between Rhett and Scarlett after the fall of Atlanta--these, yes, and many, many more.GONE WITH THE WIND will no doubt become increasingly controversial as attitudes continue to change re race, slavery, and the Civil War--but in terms of pure cinema it is a remarkable achievement for all involved and it remains a landmark to this day.  The DVD currently available offers a pristine picture and high quality sound, but I must note that the DVD has no great advantage over the current VHS release; a trailer aside, there are no bonus materials of any kind, and both are of equal quality.  Strongly recommended, but with a warning: do not mistake it for fact.  As I noted earlier, this is a South that never was, built on a form of slavery far removed from the slavery that actually existed.  Enjoy it as a beautifully made and epic romance with a host of powerful performances--but not as history."	5.0	Southern Mythology at its Most Memorable	2002-12-11	318	265	53

If you are a fan of this movie get the Blu-Ray edition and sit back to enjoy hours of pure splendor. All the extras are nice to have also but I would have bought this for the price for the picture alone. The extras are just that.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3TZX9ULDBRGI6	Genivieve	Gone with the Wind is the epitome of classic movies. The all star cast radiates the screen, Clark Gable as the rough and ready Rhett Butler, Vivien Leigh as the tempstous and ostentatious Scarlett O'Hara, Olivia de  Havilland as the sweetly naive Melanie Wilkes and Leslie Howard as the long  suffering Ashley Wilkes. The Civil War of America is perfectly depicted in  the David O Selznick masterpiece, the struggling Southern states and the  seemingly victoious Yankees and the suffering of the civilians. At the  centre of this beautiful story is Scarlett O'Hara, who is fighting a war of  her own, a war with her emotions and trying to battle on for herself,  seemingly hard and bitter. When times turned sour for her, she had the ever  present but at the same time elusive figure of Rhett Butler, who played a  major part in her destiny and was a decider for her future and she had a  frail, seemingly vulnerable sidekick in Melanie Wilkes, who loved Scarlett  more than she loved herself. Sadly in the finish, Scarlett had finally  succeeded in pushing away all those that had given her a chance and loved  her, and when she had finally grasped the man whom she had thought was her  lifeline, she knew she had made a mistake and that she was following the  wrong path.  This story of tender love, ruthless war, and jealousy and  sacrifice is one not to be missed and can be enjoyed by all ages.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2FDW0X0TAEYYF	George Sarant	"Gone With The Wind is still the all-time biggest Hollywood hit if measured in constant dollars. It represents Hollywood at the peak of its glory with the studio system in full swing, as indicated in an included excellent documentary on all the great films that came out 1939. I have the 50th anniversary laser disc, but this 70th anniversary package surpasses it in every way in terms of content and transfer. Although there is a little grain occasionally, for the most part it is remarkably clear and vibrant for a 70 year old film. It still holds up well as one of the few timeless works that Hollywood has produced.The package, which comes in a fancy box, includes a thin hardcover book with posters, cast and production features. There are copies of not terribly interesting memos from David O. Selznick. There is also a copy of the original 1939 premiere program, a set of watercolor set prints, a bonus CD soundtrack sampler, and a 6 hour documentary on a bonus CD- MGM: When the Lion Roars. It is labeled as a ""limited edition""  xxx of 150,000, so don't expect it to go rare any time soon.The Extras DVD contains a goldmine of material. In addition to the 1939 documentary, there is Gone With the Wind: The Legend Lives On, a s dreadful and inauthentic segment from the TV movie Moviola-The Scarlett O'Hara War that doesn't belong here, and The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind. There are also reflections from Olivia de Havilland, documentaries Gable: The King Remembered and Vivien Leigh: Scarlett and Beyond. There is a documentary on the restoration process, films of premieres, trailers, foreign language samples, etc. or just about everything a fan could ever want.THE BOOK; Considering the fact that both major characters lack much in the way of scruples, they don't have much happy time together, and they wind up going their separate ways it is miraculous that this story could wind up being one of the great romantic films of all time. Before this viewing I decided to read all 1000+ pages of the book to become familiar with the source material. What is truly surprising for a Hollywood production is how faithful it is to the book. The only major exception, apart from a few missing characters, is the fact that in the book Scarlett had a child by each of her first two husbands.THE CAST: Audiences at the time anticipated Gable in the role of Rhett, and he is dead-on target. It is impossible to think of anyone else playing the role or the film being the success it was without him. He was so good he was taken for granted at the time and passed over for an Oscar in favor of the gooey Mr. Chips. Vivien Leigh is Scarlett to the core. Olivia de Havilland as Melanie and Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes are both equally perfect. One should also mention Hattie McDaniel, who won an Oscar for her great performance as Mammy. The cast truly makes this picture the exceptional film that it is, under Victor Fleming's smooth direction, and David O. Selznick's perfect casting and supervision of the entire film.Today it is mind-boggling to know that most of this was filmed on a Hollywood backlot. When the camera pulls back on the scene of a vast number of Confederate wounded on an Atlanta street you know those are all real people, which today would be created digitally. All in all it is a milestone in every respect. If you care at all about movies you have to have this."	5.0	Still the greatest.	2009-12-20	6	5	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AKZ16RHG0GJAQ	"GiveMeSubtitles ""GMS"""	"***Updated Review***I will start off by saying that the film in Blu-ray is wonderful and well deserving of 5 stars.As far as the subtitles go, some subtitles are better than nothing. But the the subtitles on this disc are the worst I have ever seen. Nothing matches. Just about every scene has missing dialog. My hearing is fine but sometimes I just can't understand what the actor said so I turn them on. Now if you are really hard of hearing and can tell that the lips are moving more than what the subtitles are saying or just want to get the full dialog there are copies of the script posted online. Can't post a link here though. So how about that Katie Scarlett O'Hara!!! (That's what her dad called her in their first scene together).And just remember those of you with wide screen TV's...""There is nothing wrong with your television set....Do not attempt to adjust the picture""*. This disc is in it's original 1.33:1 version. So you will see black bars on the sides of your screen.I personally like to view movies in their original format. But if you must have your whole screen filled then see if your TV remote has a picture size button. Samsungs have a P.SIZE button. On Samsung's press P.SIZE till ""Wide Fit Move"" appears. That will fill your screen. If you want the subtitles and they are cut off at the bottom then press the up arrow above the enter button while ""Wide Fit Move"" is on the screen. That will adjust the whole picture up.So the film gets 5 stars.Subtitles accuracy 1 starsNote: my original review commented on the $39.99 price for the single disc.

That fact alone makes ""Gone With The Wind"" worthy of a 5 star rating - but this Collectors Edition DVD Collection: ABSOLUTLEY AWESOME. The color and sound have been restored and both have NEVER been better. Aside from the beautiful DVD foldout box that the DVDs come in, you're given a replica of the 1939 theatre program that was used the night that GWTW premiered in Atlanta, GA. It includes several portraits, essays on playing Rhett and Scarlett by Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, bio's on the main cast, a cast roster and a quick summary on the making of the film by its producer, Hollywood's legendary David O. Selznick. Disc 1 & 2 are the movie itself. You can choose to watch the movie with or without commentary narration on the making of the movie by film historian Rudy Behlemr. Disc 2 includes a GREAT documentary ""The Making of A Legend: Gone With The Wind"" narrated by Christopher Plummer. That alone, is worth the purchase - but wait, there's more! Also included are a documentary on recent restoration of the film, the 1939 Atlanta premiere newsreel, Foreign Language versions, the theatrical trailers for 1939, 1961, 1967, 1968 and 1987 - PLUS MORE. Disc 4 includes a new interview with the only living main cast member, the legendary Olivia de Havilland (Melanie). She tells some very great stories about filming the movie. Also included are the documentaries ""Clark Gable: The King Remembered"" and ""Vivien Leigh: Scarlett and Beyond"". I enjoyed the newer of the two most, ""Vivien Leigh: Scarlett & Beyond"" which is narrated by actress Jessica Lange. It is truly a facinating look into her life - a really, really facinating woman and brilliant actress. Lastly, the rest of the cast's bios, read by Christopher Plummer, which shows pictures and footage of each and tells of their film careers and what became of them after GWTW. Do yourself a favor and splurge for the special features on this collectors edition - you'll be so glad you did. It's a shame that not all DVD's have such great features included such as this!"	5.0	Special Features GALORE on Collectors Edition - BRAVO!	2004-12-07	18	15	3
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AZRK4W1M50ICP	Gordon Gross	I have watched it several times because Gone With The Wind is a historic and classic masterwork.  It's entertaining and also tells a story of our past and of a world that is no longer.  In addition, almost every character in it is a well-formed and fully developed study in archetypes.  All the parts are superbly acted if not slightly overacted.  You'll never see anything like this come out of Hollywood again.  Among other things, a whole lot of people would cry fowl at the blatant stereotypes of race, class and culture.Magnificent, opulent and sweeping.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AKKSHEGRQVQRK	Great Movie Addict	While these notes concern the Deluxe Edition from Amazon a few years back, I see from other sites that the basic DVD transfer is the same in this new Special Edition -- can hardly wait until November, and Amazon's price is a good deal. You still get the same DVD print as in the Deluxe issue. GWTW (one of very few films whose title is so well known that it can go by an anacronym), though dated, certainly deserved all 10 of its Oscars. Considering the limitations of 1938-39 Technicolor, the photography is phenomenal. The script and story, a remarkable achievement in its day, literally swims in Victorian sentimentality -- as, indeed, did the 1860's. The DVD print, remastered from original negatives, is very slightly murky but is a vast improvement over the original and miles ahead of the flawed VHS edition. I know many who consider this classic to be little more than a soap opera, and it's presentation of the pre-war South is over-glorified. But it's depiction of the wartime and post-war period is the best that Hollywood ever produced. Note also that the set of downtown Atlanta and Peachtree Street in this period is not very accurate -- and as one who grew up in the South, I can verify that during the entire flick there's not a single accurate Southern accent. But GWTW is still a captivating work with powerful images (the inspired scene with Scarlett wandering through the wounded at the Atlanta railroad station is a masterpiece). Even if you don't like GWTW that much, get it solely to see Clark Gable's greatest performance; it is utterly flawless. Well-deserved Oscars for all concerned; Olivia is outstanding, and Hattie is truly remarkable. I give the package 4 stars, but in every other way GWTW remains a 5-star classic.	4.0	Return of the 2-Disc Special, and a great price to boot	2004-04-28	0	0	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ACKDSX71VI5HY	"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader"""	"SPOILERS FOLLOW""Gone With the Wind,"" the Oscar-winning 1939 epic from producer David O. Selznick and director Victor Fleming, succeeds brilliantly because it manages to tell a personal story against the backdrop of a massive event.  With a huge cast including Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia de Haviland, and Leslie Howard it remains at least one of the best movies ever made.Extreme focus is one of the key ingredients in getting the various pieces to hum together.  A quotable screenplay and huge setpieces adorn what is really the story of Scarlett O'Hara's trial by fire.  A study in human will and vanity, Scarlett O'Hara is, in a sense, the embodiment of ambition and a fairly early sex symbol in movies.  Played by Vivien Leigh with a distinctive British accent and the ghost of a Southern drawl, the character stands as a decent representation of the cultured Southern Belle. However, Leigh's Scarlett also knocks down the stereotype, a very willful individual unafraid to pursue what she wants.  Clark Gable completely inhabits Rhett Butler, exhibiting an authenticity that cannot be merely acted.  There is a palpable sensuality and even barely repressed sexuality to Leigh and Gable's romantic scenes together.  The infamous scene that sees an intoxicated Rhett carry Scarlett up to bed belies the image of the 1930's as a squeaky-clean era for American movies, largely created by Frank Capra's output during the decade.Leslie Howard is genuine and solid in the role of Ashley Wilkes, the son of a well-to-do friend of the O'Hara family and not altogether unwilling recipient of Scarlett's affectionate flirtations.  Engaged to marry his cousin and wise in the ways of his own heart, Ashley is an intriguing model of a good, moral man.  Olivia de Haviland is perfect as Melanie Hamilton, the gentle and unwitting foil for Scarlett's romantic designs on Ashley.It is impossible to escape the movie's racial depictions, as a sympathetic portrayal of the South during the American Civil War.  Obviously, the black actors are not portrayed in 1939 as they would be in mainstream politically correct America in 2011.  However, I believe the character of Mammy is emblematic of the best portrayal of the black voice that the times would allow.  An emotionally strong, wise woman she is respected by both Rhett and Scarlett and is one of the bright spots of a movie that at times can be fairly bleak.  Hattie McDaniel won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance.The Blu-Ray picture is crisp, bright and sharp.  A huge amount of extra material rounds out a very complete package.Also starring Thomas Mitchell (""It's A Wonderful Life""), ""Gone With The Wind"" is a superbly well-crafted epic film."	5.0	"""Gone With The Wind"" succeeds at being a huge epic and remarkable picture"	2011-02-08	1	1	0

Selznick, one of the great, old Hollywood producers (similar to Irving Thalberg and Darryl F. Zanuck) who are as much auteurs as directors are.  The film is 4 hours, yet it never feels long, it's so well made.  There are no dull stretches at all in the film, which is amazing, considering the production was rather turbulent at times.  The credits say ""written by Sidney Howard, produced by David O. Selznick, and directed by Victor Fleming"", and that is rather deceptive.  Selznick was really the creative force behind this film, as there were nearly 8 writers on the film, and Victor Fleming was one of three directors.  Fleming had 2 nervous breakdowns during filming, and he was replaced by Sam Wood and George Cukor.  Selznick himself directed some scenes as well.  The Technicolor photography is wonderful, and the performances are some of the greatest in cinema.  Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable show why they are considered 2 of the greatest actors to ever grace the Hollywood screen.  The film is a bit romanticised at times, and it doesn't really go into the major causes of the Civil War, but it's still very entertaining and so well done you don't mind.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AP62B8RM9UTVC	Gunnar L. Ericsson	Gone With The Wind is a film that is hailed by critics and audiences both as being a true masterpiece of cinema.  The fact is though, that most people, in order not to be bashed, simply view the film with the thought in  mind that if they actually find flaws in it, then they will be ridiculed by  others.  I think this film is very overrated, and is not that great.  I  love classic films, and I have seen more than enough to know what is good  and what isn't.  I thought the story dragged in places, the acting was over  done, and there wasn't enough going on to keep the film interesting.  While  it did have great color and great camera work, it was still a bad film.  One of the few classic films that I did not like, but this is just my  opinion.  I can honestly say I could have gone my whole life without ever  seeing this film, and I would not lose any sleep over it. Judge for  yourself.	2.0	A classic that doesn't add up.	1999-12-19	29	12	17

My two cents worth: The portrayal of the Civil War and the aftermath were superb, especially for the 1930's. Costuming and set design were also very impressive, especially in the restored version. The colors were vivid, and the people were all ideally cast for their parts. I just couldn't stand anybody in the movie. Scarlett was a jealous, spoiled brat, the stereotypical ""evil sorority chick"" type. Rhett came off better, even though he had a wicked temper; he should have left sooner, or better yet, never married her in the first place. Melanie was ""good"", to the point where people took advantage of her. And Ashley... was he supposed to be good looking back then, or what? Because he didn't seem to have much going on in the personality department. Mammy was the only one who had any sense, and nobody listened to her.  Recommendations: Oh, I don't know. Casablanca?

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AEV640MKB3I9J	Hank Drake	"Is Gone With the Wind the greatest movie EVER made?  I can think of a half dozen films which exceed GWTW either in writing, the quality of the acting, or cinematic style.  Without a doubt, however, sixty years after its premiere, Gone With the Wind remains the greatest romantic melodrama ever committed to celluloid.  And I can think of no film in any genre which puts all the elements together as well as GWTW.""If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the staqe,"" goes an old Broadway aphorism.  Scarlet and Rhett are the template for dysfunctional romantic relationships in cinema.  Throughout the film, they talk AT each other instead of WITH each other.  Not until the end of the movie, as Rhett is packing to leave Scarlett, do they have an honest heart-to-heart conversation--and by then it's too late.Both Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable deliver career defining performances here, and the supporting cast of Leslie Howard (a genuine war hero in the First World War, who perished in the Second) and Olivia de Havilland dispatch their roles admirably.  Soaring above them all is Hattie McDaniel, carefully treading the line between comedy and drama, as Mammie.  Max Steiner's score is justly a classic in 20th Century filmmaking.It is true that this film should not be taken as history, for there are numerous innaccuracies.  By 21st Century standards, the film is worse than politically incorrect: sugar-coating slavery, demonizing Northerners (Yankees), and engaging in racial stereotyping of the worst sort.  What needs to be remembered is that the film actually toned down Margaret Mitchell's more overtly racist passages from the novel, partly because Clark Gable refused to use the ""N"" word.  But it should also be remembered that Hattie McDaniel was barred from attending the premiere in Atlanta an account of her ethnicity.  After seeing this film, one should also watch Roots to see a more realistic portrayal of slavery in America.This DVD edition is the best the film has looked since it's premiere, easily outclassing all previous VHS and LaserDisk issues.  The 3-strip Technicolor cinematography has to be seen to be believed--at times looking almost three-dimensional.  The sound has been remastered in 6-channel surround, but the one-channel original is also quite satisfactory."	5.0	Sui Generis...	2002-12-18	8	6	2

Well, for those who never have gone without food and experienced the devastating of war, she does appear as such. But I know otherwise. And Rhett, who fell for her simply because they were alike, came off a dashing almost saint-like figure saved for his few moments with the red-headed whore Belle (who by the way was made into another saint-hearted creature in the movie). He was not that nice in the book. Though I like his character, I love Scarlett. And the movie just does not cut as good a story as the book.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A189OTUB5NNQLH	heather	"Although I enjoyed ""Gone with the Wind"" as a wonderful form of entertainment, I was disturbed by the message that presented itself within the film.  While ""Gone with the Wind"" portrays the antebellum South in all its glory, it does not provide an honest account of either the South before or after the Civil War.Mammy, Big Sam, Prissy and the rest of the black slaves seen in this movie, are simply ideals.  Realistically, black slaves in the antebellum South were never regarded as such important and affectionate creatures as was seen in ""Gone with the Wind"".  Instead, they were seen as property.  Property that could be abused, used and degraded as white men and women saw fit.  Yes, Mammy seems to be an integral part of Scarlett's family, but if there was any degree of reality present in this film, Mammy, most likely, would have been physically and verbally abused, raped and degraded.  Moreover, it's not that I doubt that Big Sam would have come to Scarlett's aid when she was accousted in Shanty Town, but I do not think that he would have felt so much obiligation or love for his former master's daughter.  I was quite disturbed by many of the review's I read which seemed to ignore ""Gone with the Wind""'s inaccurate portrayal on slavery and seemed to concentrate, instead, on the acting and story line.  The portrayal of slavery in ""Gone with the Wind"" is an important and essential part of the film.  (...).  I did not see any elements of racism in the film, but I wish there had been some.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3HZ8ZOSDS0WAS	Heather Noel	I definitely encourage people to buy Gone With the Wind.  I love this movie because of the time period in which it takes place.  The setting is during the Civil War when all the elegance and simplicity of the early 1900s were being destroyed by a war.  I love this era of American History because of the clothing and the mannerisms of the people, so this movie hit home for me.  This movie does not stray from what actually happened during and after the Civil War.  Many war movies today exagerate war scenes.  There are very little war scenes, but the movie keeps you up to date with what is giong on throughout the war.  The actors in Gone With the Wind were casted perfectly to fit the characters that they play.  the actors made the movie feel as if you were living with them in the movie.  you are pulled from you seat and anticipate the next scenes.  the actors and the script bring you into the movie.  i believe that a good movie will do this.  This movie also has very touching music that goes along with the story line.  The music helps the viewer feel the actual emotions of the movie and characters.I would recommend this movie to anyone who really appreciates movies that are accurate to history, love the elegance and simplicity of the early 1900s, and like movies which pull them into the action.  all of these points create this movie and make it an all time classic and favorite.	5.0	greatest movie ever	2005-01-31	12	7	5

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ACO20QL72D1E6	"Henning Sebastian Jahre ""Judy-Viv"""	David O. Selznick bought Margaret Mitchell`s only novel and kept a circus going in the search for the heroine, Scarlett O`Hara(originally named Patsy by her author). There were several contenders; Bette Davis, Paulette Goddard, Joan Bennett, Tallulah Bankhead, Lana Turner and Katharine Hepburn. Early suggestions for Rhett Butler were Gary Cooper and Ronald Colman. As for Rhett the American public would hear of no one else but Clark Gable, fresh from hits such as It Happened One Night 1934-Oscar, Mutiny on the Bounty 1935, San Francisco 1936, Saratoga 1937 and Test Pilot 1938. David O, Selznick had to bite the sour apple(MGM, major studio) and borrow Gable. MGM agreed and joined the venture of the production since Selznick`s money dried out. Meanwhile Laurence Olivier filmed Wuthering Heights for Goldwyn and his girlfriend Vivien Leigh visited the set. Back in Britain all knew of Vivien`s obsession with the Scarlett role but none thought the unknown actress with only minor screen achivements would have a go. Vivien signed with Myron, Seznick`s agent brother and got herself a screentest. The result was stunning. It showed a fiery personality and a most wonderful magical face. She was signed in the Christmas week of 1938. In the late 30s letters from all over the world found themselves into the Selznick office with suggestions for the part. A man from New Zealand was the only one who mentioned Vivien. Thanks to a perfectionist of a producer(he had Victor Fleming, George Cukor, Sam Wood, William Cameron Menzies and Reeves Eason at the director`s chair - Fleming doing the most and winning the Oscar), Selznick always intended it as a PRODUCER`s film(indeed the opening credits says - DAVID O. SELZNICK`S PRODUCTION OF MARGARET MITCHELL`S STORY OF THE OLD SOUTH) - and his PERFECT casting of VIVIEN LEIGH - together with good production values make this film an all-time-great. It was the only film who was revived successfully for forty years in the cinema. The success of casting VIVIEN LEIGH was no fluke; all her subsequent but few filmroles gave the audiences an actress who gave each and every role another interpretation. Other great Vivien Leigh parts include CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA, Mary Treadwell in SHIP OF FOOLS, Blanche DuBois in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, Myra Lester in WATERLOO BRIDGE and Emma in THAT HAMILTON WOMAN - UK title: Lady Hamilton.

Vibrant colors, great sound and shown in its original 1:37 aspect ratio (altough I'm curious to see how the movie looks when they re-released it in widescreen for the big screen).If you are a fan of this movie, this is the edition to buy. And if you hate this film, you should buy it too and perhaps your appreciation for it will change.	5.0	Gone With The Wind in HD	2012-12-14	2	0	2

For those who say it's racist, I will have you know Hattie who played Mammy was the first black person to win an Oscar - ever. This movie helped pave the way for blacks to be taken seriously in the film industry. You can't make a romantacised movie about rich Old Southerners without slaves.This remains one of the best movies ever made.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	This is the real milestone in what historic roots concerns . It owns a superb and extremely detailed scope about every frame of the Old Days of the Civil War .This monumental film which belongs to the artistic museum of the memory is filmed with glorious and sublime good taste ; with wonderful script and ravishiung performances of all the cast .There was any hole in this superb work . Consider this film as one of the top five best Americna films in anyage . It owns the seal of the immortality.Somehow that statement when Scarlett O'Hara affirms that neither no one nor nothing will stop her , are part of its multiple virtues . The names of Rhet Butler and Scarlet O ` Hara now are part of the story .The musical score : Tara `s theme pays a deserved homage to that well designed home in which Gable will tell her  the famous answer : I don' t give a ...just before closing the door .The movie runs for three hours and forty two minutes but with splendid cast and artistic direction ; you won' t miss it .And beware this footnote : the special charm of this timeless resides in its mythological roots present in the uncosncious collective.	5.0	Does this classic film need any other advise ?	2004-12-19	3	1	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1IGOS193EJGPH	Honey	"Enough to rank this as a five star movie, but it so much more than that...  I'm fascinated by its beauty and ability to romanticize a part of American History that was quite bloody and cruel!It's an epic. One of the biggest Epics ever! A historical backdrop, with a twisted/unrequited ""double"" love story woven into its fabric. Not just the chance or hope of love from another, but love of the land and of a certain lifestyle.It's a movie of growth for Scarlett and for our nation.  It's a movie of great greed and selfishness, for Scarlett and our nation!  It's also a story of lost chances and rueful regrets.  The grass always looks greener on the other side, but beware! You could be pining after your neighbors' yard and miss the love growing and blooming in your own.  Such was the case with Scarlett and Rhett.Fantasies are a hard thing to let die, which is why I think Scarlett clung so tightly to her fantasy of Ashley.  He represented all that she once new and I think in her eyes, he was a link to their once ""golden"" past and she didn't want to release that dream.  What a spoiled brat she was...loveable one though...  I did enjoy her tough, whatever it takes resolve.  She's a twist of a heroine and a selfish indulgent child and Vivian Leigh played it to the hilt.This film offers war, love, death and the endurance of the human spirit in the face of defeat.  While it is written from a ""romantic"" Southern point of view, you can't help but to enjoy it.  Not many films in those days encompassed such a range of the human experience. It was groundbreaking, as it should have been.What I love most about GWTH it endures as a classic. When I started collecting DVD's this is one of the first I purchased, and when I'm feeling a certain kind of way, I pop this in..curl up under the covers and revel in its complicated beauty.There is no way, I could have been a Southern Belle in those days, but I love this film nonetheless.  It could have been so much more brutal and bloody, but instead, it is beautiful....and somedays, you just need high gloss and an imaginary dance with history. If I wish otherwise, I can watch a documentary, or seek out other ""authentic"" Civil War inspired films.Sometimes, it's okay to coat a pill in sugar...and GWTH does just that."	5.0	The Cinematography is....	2005-08-19	7	5	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AOSIEAVE18JCA	Hoyt Harris	"Almost four years ago, on November 17th, the 70th Anniversary Edition of GONE WITH THE WIND (1939) was released in a special 5-disc boxed set. While a Hollywood classic, GWTW is not for everyone.GWTW is not for you if:1) you think a movie must be as historically accurate as a history book;2) you think a 1939 movie should reflect the values of the 21st century;3) your attention span doesn't allow you to watch movies longer than two hours;4) you can only accept politically correct films, particularly in terms of racial issues;5) you can only accept special effects as they appear in (computerized) modern films;6) your idea of great acting is to be found only in the slasher or teen films being made today.Some find GWTW a ridiculously overblown, exaggerated re-telling of the Old South. To others, Scarlett O'Hara is nothing more than a spoiled brat who never really grows up; or, by the time she shows a glimmer of doing so, it's too late.What one should keep in mind when watching GONE WITH THE WIND: it is not a documentary. Despite the obsessive care producer David O. Selznick lavished on historical accuracy as to the ""look"" of the period--the clothes, the interiors--the movie is not reality, but rather an historical romance set against the bloodiest war ever fought on American soil, a war in which at least 618,000 Americans died. (Some experts say the toll reached 700,000. The number that is most often quoted is 620,000. At any rate, these casualties exceed the nation's total loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.)GWTW is a great--perhaps THE great--Hollywood example of the power of film: although battle scenes are never actually shown, the results of the war--the devastation, disease and death--are so powerfully depicted that people swear they ""remember"" seeing bloody combat in the movie.WITH ONE LOOK: Vivien Leigh as Scarlett, at the Atlanta church-turned-charnel house of diseased, dying and dead soldiers. With one reaction shot(see below)--her revulsion at a soldier's screams as his leg is amputated, without anesthesia--Vivien Leigh conveys the horrors--and the (never shown) bloody battles--of war.This power of film is perhaps why GWTW comes in for different criticisms. The movie is so real in its physical aspects--its ""look""--that it is criticized for not being (historically) accurate in others. But, again, the movie is not a documentary. It is a m-o-v-i-e based on a novel; i.e. fiction.Not only is GWTW not a documentary on the Civil War period, it is not a history of slavery in America. It was criticized--as was the novel--for its treatment of blacks. But upon an objective viewing of the movie today, it is quite often the slaves--Mammy, Pork, Big Sam--who are the only characters with any sense. Of course, GONE WITH THE WIND, with its happy plantation slaves posed against bleeding robin's breast sunsets, has its enraging and embarrassing moments; the racist depiction is, regrettably, part of the nation's collective past.Caption: Hattie McDaniel as Mammy explaining to Melanie (Olivia de Havilland) that Rhett has locked himself in the room with his daughter Bonnie's corpse and has threatened to kill Scarlett if she buries the child.If this scene alone doesn't rip your heart out--largely due to McDaniel's performance--then pick up the phone and call the undertaker because you are most assuredly dead.Taken as cultural artifact of an earlier period of American movie-making, one has to look at it as anthropology tells us we must look at cultures not our own. That is, just as we must ""judge"" a culture on its own terms, we must look at a 70-year-old movie in terms of the times in which it was produced.Finally, GONE WITH THE WIND is an adaptation of a novel written by a Southern woman who, as a child, sat and listened to the stories the old Confederate veterans told about the old days before, during, and after The War. It is a love story, inspired in part by the novelist's grandmother, reflecting the attitudes left over from that long-ago time.Taken on its own terms, it remains the prototype of the Hollywood epic film. It achieved many firsts. Today, it remains--in terms of tickets sold--the all-time box office champ.---Hoyt Harris, Lafayette, LAGone with the Wind (70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition)Victor Fleming: An American Movie MasterFrankly, My Dear: ""Gone with the Wind"" Revisited (Icons of America)Gone with the wind, the screenplay by Sidney Howard; based on the novel by Margaret Mitchell***Vivien Leigh: A BiographyDavid O. Selznick's Hollywood*** *** *** *** *** *** ***Two years after announcing he would bring ""Gone with the Wind"" to the screen, producer David. O. Selznick--after paying the publisher MacMillan a record sum for the rights--still did not have a script. He was still a couple of months away from getting MGM to loan Clark Gable in return for world distribution rights and half the film's box office.Despite a phenomenally costly, two-year, nationwide search for an actress---amateur or professional--to play the tempestuous, spoiled and fickle Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara, Selznick still didn't have his Scarlett, either. (In all, 1,400 hopefuls were interviewed, 90 given screen tests, and exactly one actually cast, in a minor role. Also considered: Katharine Hepburn (who lobbied for the part), Bette Davis, and even RKO Studio's loony suggestion of Lucille Ball. Charlie Chaplin's companion, Paulette Goddard, seemed to have the role locked up, but a massive letter campaign spearheaded by the Florida chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy torpedoed it.)With or without a Scarlett, construction crews needed to get cracking on building sets for Selznick's epic--what many doomsayers were already calling ""Selznick's folly."" To make room for construction of a two-mile long re-creation of Old Atlanta, the back lot of Selznick International Pictures had to be cleared of old movie sets.Someone came up with the idea of burning the remnants of the set of KING KONG (1933) and filming it as the ""burning of Atlanta,"" one of the great visual sequences in all of film.Just as Life itself so often does, it came down to one shot. There could be no retakes.Without a script, without stars for the two principal characters, on the night of December 10, 1938, the shooting of GONE WITH THE WIND finally began--stunt doubles for Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler escaping the inferno on buckboard as Los Angeles firemen aimed their hoses at the raining embers. (The fire on the Culver City back lot--fed by an elaborate system of pipes pumping oil and water through the sets so that the fire could be raised or lowered at will--was huge and intense. Its red glow was so ominous on low-hanging clouds on this chilly December night that hundreds of L.A. residents called the fire department, wanting to know if MGM was on fire.)Because there could be no retakes, the lenses of every available Technicolor camera (there were no more than a dozen in existence) were trained on the one-chance, make-or-break scene. As the sets went up in flames, Selznick's brother, the agent Myron Selznick, brought a lovely British actress onto the scaffolding, a perch from which ""General"" David Selznick was watching the inferno.David looked into the eyes of this exquisite, dark-haired, green-eyed beauty.A British actress little known in the United States at that time, Vivien Leigh-- who had made her first stage appearance at the age of three, reciting ""Little Bo Peep""--was 26.But Vivien Leigh's entrance was no accident. She had come to Hollywood from England ostensibly to be with her lover Laurence Olivier, one of Myron's clients, whom she would marry a year and a half later when his divorce--and hers--became final.But Vivien Leigh had also come to Hollywood to pursue the part of Scarlett.Both Selznicks already knew of Leigh. But it wasn't until this night--with the crimson glow of the burning movie set illuminating her face--that David O. Selznick first laid eyes on Vivien Leigh.Leigh reportedly auditioned for then-director George Cukor that very night. A week and a half later, on December 21 and December 22, her screen tests were made. Legend has it that George Cukor called her three days later on Christmas Day to tell her she had the part. She signed her contract on January 16, 1939. Principal photography began on January 26.The opening scene of ""Gone With The Wind,"" in which the Tarleton Twins are talking to Scarlett about the war, was one of the most troubled scenes of the film. It was shot a total of five times. The first time was on Thursday, January 26, 1939. Selznick was not satisfied with this take because the Twins's hair, dyed red for the film, appeared ""too orange"" in Technicolor. The scene was shot again on Monday, January 30, but was not used because of the lighting. When George Cukor left the production, Victor Fleming took over; his first scene, shot on Wednesday, March 1, was the porch scene. But Selznick was not happy with the Twins' performances so the take was not used. Fleming shot the scene again on Monday, June 26. This take was not used because Vivien Leigh looked ""exhausted."" She took a vacation before returning to shoot the scene a final time on Thursday, October 12, 1939. It was the last scene shot with Vivien Leigh and is the version that appears in the final film.So, in the finished film, Vivien Leigh is almost nine months older at the beginning of the movie than she is at the end of the movie.Now, let's fast-forward thirteen months.January 29, 1940-- Los Angeles--Ambassador Hotel's Coconut Grove.It's Oscar night in Hollywood. With comedian Bob Hope emceeing, the Oscar ceremony is underway. One after another, the gold-plated statuettes--gold-plated, 92 percent tin now, but gold-plated solid bronze on this night--are showered on GONE WITH THE WIND. It won't be a ""clean sweep,"" but the movie will set a record for most Oscars won.--William Cameron Menzies for his use of color.--Hal Kern and James Newcom for film editing.--Ernest Haller and Ray Renahan for color cinema photography.--Lyle Wheeler for art direction.Acclaimed author Sinclair Lewis announces the Academy Award for best screen adaptation: a posthumous Oscar (the first such Oscar ever given) to writer Sidney Howard.(A lover of the quiet rural life, Howard had died five months earlier while working on his 700-acre farm in Tyringham, Massachusetts. The screenwriter was crushed to death in a garage by his two-and-a-half ton tractor. He had turned the ignition switch on and was cranking the engine to start it when it lurched forward, pinning him against the wall of the garage. Apparently an employee had left the transmission in high gear. Sidney Howard died less than four months before the movie he scripted had premiered. He never saw the movie that he had written--with the help of many others, including his micromanaging, obsessed producer.)Mervyn LeRoy, who produced THE WIZARD OF OZ this same year, steps to the podium to present the next Academy Award.--Best direction to Victor Fleming--who had simultaneously directed OZ--for GONE WITH THE WIND.All Oscar nights since the first one in 1928 had been glamorous ones. But this night was special. It represented what history would soon realize was the zenith, the high-water mark of the studio system and the Golden Age of Hollywood. In the twelve months of 1939, more now-classic films were produced than in any year-- before or since.In addition to GONE WITH THE WIND, 1939 saw production of the following movies:* Edmund Goulding's DARK VICTORY (with three nominations and no wins) about a young heiress who is slowly dying of a brain tumor and ultimately accepts her death in noble fashion* Director Sam Wood's GOODBY MR CHIPS (with seven nominations and one win - Best Actor), a version of James Hilton's novel about a beloved Latin teacher/schoolmaster at an English public school (the Brookfield School for Boys)* Director Leo McCarey's tearjerker LOVE AFFAIR (with five nominations and no wins) - that he later remade as AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER (1957) - about two lovers who promise to meet atop the Empire State Building* Director Ernst Lubitsch's delightful romantic comedy NINOTCHKA (with four nominations and no wins) about a cold Soviet official sent to Paris* Director Lewis Milestone's adaptation of the classic John Steinbeck tragedy ""Of Mice and Men"" (with five nominations and no wins)* Director John Ford's version of Ernest Haycox's story ""Stage to Lordsburg"", STAGECOACH (with seven nominations and two wins - Best Supporting Actor and Best Score) - the director's first film with star John Wayne - about a stagecoach journey by a varied group of characters* Director Victor Fleming's perennial favorite - the beloved fantasy film about a Kansas farm girl who journeys to a brightly colored world in THE WIZARD OF OZ (with six nominations and only two wins - Best Song ""Over the Rainbow"" (almost cut from the film by MGM executives) and Best Original Score)* Director William Wyler's best film version of Emily Bronte's romantic novel about doomed lovers in WUTHERING HEIGHTS (with eight nominations and only one win - Best Black and White Cinematography by Gregg Toland, who, the following year would shoot CITIZEN KANE for Orson Welles)* Director Frank Capra's film MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON (with eleven nominations and only one win - Best Original story) of Lewis Foster's story about a naive and innocent junior senator.But on this night the movie receiving Hollywood's glitter and gold was perhaps the most highly anticipated film in Hollywood history. The public had quickly made Margaret Mitchell's novel a best-seller after its publication in 1936. (It won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1937.) Sales of the novel, at the virtually unprecedented price of three dollars, reached about one million by the end of that year. Once it was announced that Selznick planned to adapt it the screen, the novel's legion of fans eagerly gobbled up any news about the production. The public also began clamoring for their favorite stars to play specific characters in the book.Five months earlier---while the film was being edited---when Selznick was asked by the press how he felt about the film, he said: ""At noon I think it's divine, at midnight I think it's lousy. Sometimes I think it's the greatest picture ever made. But if it's only a great picture, I'll still be satisfied.""On September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife Irene Mayer Selznick, investor Jock Whitney, and film editor Hal Kern drove out to Riverside, California, with all of the film reels to preview it before an audience. The film was still unfinished, missing many optical effects and most of Max Steiner's music score. They arrived at the Fox Theatre, which was playing a double feature of HAWAIIAN NIGHTS and BEAU GESTE. Kern called for the manager and explained that they had selected his theatre for the first public screening of GONE WITH THE WIND. The theater manager was told that after HAWAIIAN NIGHTS had finished, he could make an announcement of the preview, but was forbidden to say what the film was. People were permitted to leave, but the theatre would thereafter be sealed with no re-admissions and no phone calls out. The manager was reluctant, but finally agreed. His only request was to call his wife to come to the theatre immediately. Kern stood by him as he made the call to make sure he did not reveal to his wife the name of the film.When the film began, there was a buzz in the audience when Selznick's name appeared, for they had been reading about the making of the film for more than two years.In an interview years later, Kern described the exact moment the audience realized what was happening:""When Margaret Mitchell's name came on the screen, you never heard such a sound in your life.""They just yelled, they stood up on the seats...I had the [manually-operated sound] box. And I had that music wide open and you couldn't hear a thing. Mrs. Selznick was crying like a baby and so was David and so was I. Oh, what a thrill! And when (the words) ""Gone with the Wind"" came on the screen, it was thunderous!""In his biography of Selznick, David Thomson wrote that the audience's response before the story had even started ""was the greatest moment of his life, the greatest victory and redemption of all his failings.""After the film, there was a huge ovation. In the preview cards filled out after the screening, two-thirds of the audience had rated it excellent, an unusually high rating. Most of the audience begged that the film not be cut shorter and many suggested that instead they eliminate the newsreels, shorts and B-movie feature, which is eventually how GONE WITH THE WIND was screened and would soon become the norm in movie theatres around the world.With thirteen nominations, the most ever up until that time, GONE WITH THE WIND won 10 Academy Awards--8 regular, 1 honorary, 1 technical--a record that stood for twenty years, until BEN HUR won eleven in 1960.***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****Quoting GWTW:Rhett: With enough courage, you can do without a reputation.Scarlett: Great balls of fire.

But it was not worth my time of watching for 2 hours, much less 4 whole hours. It seems that everyone loves the 1939 film of Gone with the Wind, but I don't see the apparent greatness. It held my interest for a while, but the story seemed to disintegrate with each of Scarlett's marriages. I found Hattie McDaniel's role as Mammy to be the most interesting out of all the characters. Overall, I don't feel like it was a satisfying movie to watch. At least I've now watched it once, and hopefully will not ever have to watch it again.	2.0	What's the big deal?	2012-12-04	7	2	5

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3GE37LKX67QOB	Jaina	Okay, other reviewers have already explained why this movie is so incredible.  I only give the DVD edition three stars, though.  With a movie this old and with such a rich history, to have so few extras on the DVD is pretty cheap.  One of the most glaring omissions is that there are subtitles in French... and none in Spanish!  Last time I checked, this country had 30 million native Spanish speakers, which means that well over 10% of our population speaks Spanish as their first language.  I'll admit that I might not have noticed this if it weren't for the fact that I teach in a school in which I have a few students who speak very little English.  Regardless, though, why on earth would anyone release a DVD in the US with French subtitles and not Spanish ones?  In general, the producers of the DVD certainly didn't break a sweat trying to make the release anything other than a digital version of a VHS release.	3.0	Great Film, Only a Few Flaws With DVD Release	2005-06-22	6	2	4

I would say the best dvd edition ever to be relesed with great special features including making of, interviews, special bigography's of the actors. The story is just great about the old south and the starting of the civil war. The acting is great and canoot be surpassed by any other film. While you watch the film you wish they would make movies like that now a days. The costumes are great and the music is excellent.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2984LNWS90R7C	James A. White	This movie, originally made in 1939, transcends time.  Vivien Leigh, an English actress, gave a convincing portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara.  Clark Gable's Rhet Butler became his trademark.  Olivia de Havilland gave a  wonderful preformance as Melanie who actually has more strength and  determination than Scarlett gives her credit for.  In my opinion, Leslie  Howard was the only bad spot in the film.  He was a good actor and brought  the role to life, but, to me, his character was much more wishy-washy and  pathetic than Melanie's ever dreamed about being.Basically, this film is  about a spoiled child, which has gotten everything handed to her on a  silver platter all her life, who has to wake up aand face reality in a very  troublesome time.  She fights and claws her way to money and power and  never gives up.  In the words of Rhett while Scarlett is voicing her fears  of the Yankees, I'd pity any Yankee who ever came across her!	5.0	A Timeless Classic	2000-03-31	2	2	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2SEIR2R109O0Y	James	"Until just this morning I had never seen Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind. I had always heard stories and criticisms that it was the greatest love story of all time. Although a very romantic and often times soppy I found myself actually really enjoying the movie. It is a fabulous tale, which I found wonderfully, traces the relationship of Scarlet and Rhet from their first meeting to their end. However, from the beginning you realize that the setting is an almost fantasy world. In the text, which introduces the film, it tells of a lost time of the last knights and ladies. From the perspective, which the movie gives, you almost find yourself longing to be a player amongst the ladies and ""chivalrous"" gentlemen at the twelve oaks plantations ball.  Also most extraordinary, is the perspective the movie gives of the slave-master relationship. Not only are most of the slaves portrayed as extremely ridiculous characters in themselves, the way in which they interact with the white members of the plantation is very unlikely. Mammy and Old Sam are lovable characters but as Tim notes in his critique they are totally undeveloped. They remain in their very specific roles throughout the film and rarely is there a scene without a white member in it. Despite these very unbelievable aspects of the film, I think it is important to recognize the context and time period of this picture. The movie was made in 1939 and was written to tell a tale of the glorified Old South and it accomplishes exactly that. In the 1930's there was much more of a focus in glorifying the Civil War time period than showing accurate race relations."	4.0	GWTW review	2001-11-19	25	9	16

I did not understand why all the men fell for Scarlett (even as a child I knew she could be hateful) but I liked her anyway...she is one of the strongest feminine characters I can think of -- books or film.I had gotten annoyed at all the versions available.  Each one came with one or two ""extras"" that were not available in other versions.Fear not, fans. This is the ultimate edition -- hands down.I am still watching extras, but I'm through about two thirds of them.  I have read books about the filming of this movie but I am learning so much from these extras!The movie itself...WOW.  There are so many things that I haven't noticed before simply because the picture wasn't clear enough to make it noticeable.  Mostly wonderful little details on the costumes that are just too great.  Flowers on bonnets, patterns on fabrics, richness of textures...captured gloriously.Grab this one if you are a fan.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1345VRK5MYG7	James L.	Is Gone With The Wind the greatest example of filmmaking?  No.  But it is one of the greatest examples of movie entertainment out there.  The proof is in the way this movie of epic length and proportion has held the  audience attention for over sixty years.  Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are  larger than life as two of the most famous characters of all time.  Gable  in particular deserves credit for a performance that displays a wider  emotional range than we're used to seeing from him.  Olivia deHavilland is  perfect in a role that must have been difficult to bring to life and seem  real.  Hattie McDaniel is terrific, finally given a chance to show her  dramatic ability instead of simply being comic relief.  Only Leslie Howard  fails to deliver, and he seems uncomfortable with his role.  The  technicolor is beautiful, the swelling score is unforgettable, and although  I think the first half of the movie works better than the second half, the  film as a whole reminds you of the magic that movies can make.	5.0	What Can Be Added?	2000-03-11	5	5	0
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AQ01Q3070LT29	James McDonald	"Considered to be one of the best classic epics ever made.  The only one of its kind at that time.  1939 was a magic year for movies.  Many excellent, dramatic films were released.  But ""Gone With The Wind"" was the crown jewel, having won 10 Academy Awards.  Although the story is mostly for adults, including the unforgettable ""rape"" scene when Clark Cable took Vivian Leigh up the red-carpeted stairs.Teenagers might find this entertaining as well.  If you catch your teen watching this film alone and in peace...let them.  Trust me, you'll thank me later.Now you can see this film without commercial interruptions and no network logo in the corner.  No scatches.  Just brilliant original technicolor with your choice of Dolby Digital remastered soundtrack or original monophonic.The entire 3 hours and 53 minutes is all here.  All on one disc in standard format.  Included are the Overture, Intermission, Entr'acte and Exit Music.  The movie continues on the other side of the disc. ""Overture"" is the beginning of the film.Many scenes of Gone With The Wind were reshot either because of color of hair, costumes or an in-studio shot for a better on-location shot.  One interesting scene omitted from the film takes places just after the infamous ""rape"" scene with Rhett carrying Scarlett up the stairs.  Look quick at the next scene.  There is a mysterious breakfast tray in bed on the left.  We see Bonnie leaving and Mammy complaining of aches and pains.  The scene removed is Bonnie bringing in the breakfast tray to her mother.  Perhaps, lost footage will be found someday (if not corroded) and maybe included it in a future restored DVD version.In September 1991, the continuing story of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler was officially written and published by the late Alexandra Ripley in a novel,Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's ""Gone With the Wind"".""  This was followed by the CBS television mini-series, Scarlett (Mini-series 2 DVDs) (Import - NTSC All Regions) in 1994.A new novel,Rhett Butler's People, by Donald McCraig was available November 6, 2007."	5.0	Will Scarlett ever mentally mature for a gent like Rhett.	2004-02-07	8	7	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A39JBWISW035LZ	J. Anderson	The best part about Blu-ray is that movies converted to high definition video bring you back to the theatre and the theatrical experience, as the producer had originally intended.  After seeing GWTW so many times on TV,  out of focus, edited for television, chopped up for commercials, it is refreshing to see this version of the classic. I am too young to have seen this movie while it was still in the theatre, so the Blu-ray version becomes the next best thing.  We are too often spoiled by the slickness of CG graphics and digital sound, by widescreen presentations, and by cartoon physics.  GWTW was made using real film, real stunts, and real people.  It is humanity at its best.  Megahertz and Gigabyte could have been the names of the horses used in the escape scene from the burning of Atlanta, but in the real context of this movie, the act of  digital conversion was meant to best convey the original theatrical experience to a new generation of  viewers.	5.0	The best part about Blu-Ray	2010-11-03	6	4	2

It is a movie I never get tired of. Yet I had never read the book. Finally I saw several people get into a discussion of the book on facebook. They all talked about their love of the book and how it's even better than the movie. I never really wanted to read the book because I love the movie so much I thought it just couldn't be as good. But they convinced me to read it. Granted, it is a very long book, but oh, how I love it and will definitely read it again and probably yet again. The movie is in the book but the book is so much more than the movie. I was a little intimidated by the length but it's a very easy read. It's entertaining from the first page to the last. Whether you have seen the movie or not, this is a classic that will never be outdated. Sadly, the generation now is not as familiar with the movie or the book. I got the book for my 28 yr old daughter and she is reading, and loving, it now. She has never seen the movie so I also got the movie so we can watch it together when she is done with the book.

It's for the horrible lack of interest or care for the fans because this DVD version has zero extras on it.  Even Carnival of Souls, a low-budget cult movie has nearly 3 hours of outakes, the &quot;making of...&quot;, interviews. And then you look at the outstanding care and planning someone lavished on the DVD version of &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; with the &quot;Making of...&quot;interviews, deleted, scenes, interviews with cast members,and it's criminal that &quot;wind&quot; is just thrown out to the public as an ordinary movie.  It's scary to think of the indifference of the people behind this dismal presentation of GWTW. Aren't the creators aware there are still tons of archival material that fans would lap up? Deleted scenes, costume tests, more unseen auditions, interviews with surviving members of the cast: Cammie Sue king (Bonnie Butler) EVelyn Keyes (Suellen), Ann Rutherford (Karen), etc. I'll continue watching my VHS version which looks wonderful, and then watching my VHS version of &quot;The Making of a Legend&quot; until the definitive DVD of the world's greatest film is finally released.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1D37L13I5T90J	J. Baltazar	I usually don't like purchasing collector's edition boxes as I don't usually care for the extra items and they are bulky to store. The boxed set of Gone With The Wind impressed me though. It is elegantly packaged in red velvet box and the extra items are awesome as well, like the David Selznick memos about choosing among Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Errol Flynn for the role of Rhett, the hardbound photo book and souvenir program reproduction. The price at Amazon was also almost half the regular price, so the purchase was well worth it. Best of all, I got the set yesterday on the day of release, even though I used the free-shipping option. I noticed that Amazon is now using Ontrac for delivery and the orders seem to arrive much quicker.Now for the blu-ray itself...the transfer is simply awesome. The color correction and clarity are breathtaking. I actually noticed wrinkles on Vivien Leigh and Leslie Howard's faces, which make you realize that they were actually older than the roles they played. The film is in the original 1.33 aspect ratio, which was common for movies in those days. I know some people are looking for the widescreen version, which this film was not originally shot in. If you have a good HDTV, the solution is simple by viewing using wide zoom to fill the screen. You lose part of the top and bottom details, but there's usually not much there. I do mind when they crop the sides to make widescreen fit regular screens (pan & scan) as you lose lots of details on the sides. However, if you want to see this movie in its original glory with all the details, then watch it in the original aspect ratio. I also like that the whole movie is in one disc for continuous viewing without having to change discs. You know how long it sometimes takes to load a blu-ray disc, but this one loads fast as they don't have the elaborate menus to slow it down.There are many extras on the second disc and the only one I viewed so far was the restoration process, which is always fascinating to me because of the age of the movie.Overall, this collection is well worth the purchase. I just wonder what they will come up next for the 75th anniversary. Maybe by that time HDTV's can display at 8000p and we'll end up seeing more details than available now.	5.0	70th Anniversary Collector's Edition Blu-ray WOW!	2009-11-18	12	10	2

Biographies on the major actors, the producers, the directors and the author of the Pulitzer Prize winning book added much to the experience.  The quality is excellent and I didn't mind that it was not in Blu-ray, as the picture seemed perfect.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1HDXZ7HGOJTHL	"Jeena ""Maggie the Cat"""	This movie reflects the commonly held prejudices of its time, and as such it's racist. The blacks in the cast are stereotypes, and that's hard to watch. It really detracts from the movie...like having someone come along and slap you in the face every so often during the movie. Same goes for the romantic image promulgated by the movie regarding the antebellum South. I'm sure the slaves were just thrilled to be owned by others, whipped, and to have their families torn apart. The terror must have been mind-boggling. Yet this movie depicts &#34;the old South&#34; as some kind of lost heaven-on-earth. Total hooey, and an insult to the intelligence of anyone who knows anything about slave-owning cultures.The two leads give great performances, as do many in the supporting cast. I like the idea of a woman taking charge of her own life and showing her mettle in the face of adversity. The idea that past trauma can make a person push love away is appealing. I think many of us can understand the tragedy of that kind of self-imposed emotional prison. Trouble is, in the movie only the whites are shown as multifaceted, nuanced characters with back-stories.Overall I liked the movie because it's entertaining, but the racism made it awfully hard to stomach. Yeah, the good old days...only if you were white!	3.0	Some fine acting, but the racism's hard to take	2012-12-25	6	2	4
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2CEX7784M8YSU	Jeffery Bauman	"Movie: Okay, lets just get this out of the way: ""Gone With The Wind"" was, is, and will always be the best movie ever made. There, I said it.  Ever since its premiere in 1939 ""Gone With The Wind"" set the bar for which all motion pictures after it.  There would be no ""Star Wars,"" ""Ben Hur,"" ""Titanic,"" or ""Lord Of The Rings"" Trilogy if ""Gone With The Wind"" had not been such a grand achievement.  Every frame of the film drips with sheer perfection.  The sets are grand, the acting marvelous, and the direction impeccable.  My favorite thing about ""Gone With The Wind"" would have to be the cast.  Hattie Macdaniel was marvelous as Mammy, Olivia DeHaviland heavenly as Melanie, Leslie Howard great as Ashley, and Clark Gable is sheer perfection as Rhett Butler.  Last but certainly not least, Vivien Leigh IS Scarlett O'Hara.  Isn't it obvious that I love this movie?  With that said, let's take a look at the DVD.Movie: (Ten Million/5)Picture: If you already own the previous single disc release from MGM, you can safely throw it away in favor of this set.  Simply put, the picture is marvelous.  The film has been painstakingly restored from the original 3-Strip Technicolor Negatives.  When the three Technicolor negatives are re-aligned, there is a level of clarity that has never been seen before.  There is a featurette in the supplements section that explains just how this process was accomplished.  Compared to previous VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD incarnations, the results are truly startling.  The colors are wondrous, the picture is sharp, and there are no faults to be found at all. Simply amazing!  (6/5)Sound:  The film's soundtrack has been remastered in a wonderful new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.  There results are simply splendid.  In a comparison, this is the same track that appeared on the single disc DVD. However, that is not a bad thing.  The dialog souds great.  There is no hiss or distortion of any kind.  Surround activity is limited (What do you expect? The soundtrack was recorded in 1939!)  The surrounds benefit the most from Max Steiner's wondrous score, and in the evacuation of Atlanta sequence.  For purists, the film's original mono soundtrack has also been included, and it sounds great.  (5/5)Extras: Rejoice!  Fans at long last have the definitve version of ""Gone With The Wind!""  There are tons of goodies in this set. Discs One and Two house the film itself. They also contain an excellent commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer.  His commentary is interesting and informative that is filled with fascinating bits of information about the production.Discs Three and Four house the bulk of the extras.""Making of a Legend: Gone With The Wind"" is the best documentary on the making of a film I have ever seen.  There are interviews with many of the kehy people in the production as well as screen tests, Oscar footage, archival footage, and much more. This is worth the price of the box set alone.Next up is ""Restoring A Legend."" This takes you inside Warner's restoration facilities to see firsthand the painstaking restoration that went into this set. This is one of my favorite featurettes simply because it is so nice to hear about all the hard work, sweat, blood, tears, and most of all love that Warner Brothers Home Video is putting into making ""Gone With The Wind"" and other classic titles so they can look and sound their best for years to come. Bravo!On disc three you'll also find ""Dixie Hails Gone With The Wind!"" short, ""Civil War Centennial"" short, ""The Old South"" short, the international prologue to explain to other countries what the Civil War was, brief international language dub scenes, and a trailer gallery.On disc four you'll find ""Melanie Remembers: Reflections by Olivia DeHaviland."" Ms. DeHaviland is a gracious hostess, and it is a joy to hear her recollections.  ""Gable: The King Remembered"" is a 1975 documentary on Clark Gable.  This is very classy and quite informative, and was an excellent addition. ""Vivien Leigh: Scarlett and Beyond"" is next. This is also a great documentary on the legendary actress, and is quite well done.  Next are numerous mini documentaries on the supporting players that run from under one minute to around five minutes in length. These are nice to have, and really help to round out the set. Also included is a reproduction of the original 1939 souvenir program. Very classy. (10/5)Overall: The greatest film ever made gets, in my opinion, the best DVD ever produced. Thank god Warner knows how to preserve these this and other classic films so people can continue to appreciate them for generations to come. A superb restoration and a plethora of extras make this a no-brainer. If you only buy one DVD in your life, buy this one! This is the best DVD I have ever seen, and I am so happy to have it in my collection. Thank you Warner Brothers for getting it right!  (10/5)"	5.0	Gone With The Wind DVD Review	2005-10-28	35	30	5
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1YIWDKM1292L4	"jenbird ""book and classic movie fiend"""	"Please note that my disappointment was in no way with  ""Gone With the Wind"" itself, which is, as we all know, is one of the greatest movies of all time. I couldn't say anything about this wonderful film that hasn't been said already. This big, lush, box set, however, left a lot to be desired.Let's start with the 8 original limited edition lobby card prints. They're obviously colorized, and hideously so. Mammy in a neon pink headdress? The same neon pink as the stripes on the soldier's pants at the charity bazaar? I don't think so. And excuse me, the dress Scarlett wore when she fled from Atlanta and for some time after that was lavendar, not French's mustard yellow. Nor is anyone's skin that ""flesh"" color, ever.Moving on to the 6 original black and white photograph cards (and why would you print black and white photos of a beautiful color movie like this, anyway?)...I could have done a better job on my home computer, with screen captures. The pictures, which include Rhett at the bottom of the stairs seeing Scarlett for the first time, are very blurry. Even the close up of Rhett and Scarlett about to kiss (after Frank Kennedy's funeral) isn't clear.The 35 mm film frame I received was of Rhett bidding Scarlett farewell on the road to Tara; the accompanying art graphic is very dark and muddy. I have to hold the film cell up to bright light to even see it, so forget about framing it.The 27x40 movie poster was very nice, and I'll end up getting a frame to display it.The DVD lists its ""special features"" as interactive menus and scene access; isn't that pretty much standard by now? The extras consist of a trivia game (you don't guess the answers, they'll give them to you on the next screen) and the movie trailer. That's it. One of the greatest films of all time, and that's the best you can do? What about the excellent documentary ""The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind""? I have that on VHS and it's wonderful. That could have been added to make a two disc set.I'd wanted ""GWTW"" on DVD for a long time, and instead of buying the much less expensive DVD (where I could have had a choice of standard or widescreen versions), I had to hold out for the big box set. I wonder now why I bothered."	3.0	A disappointing box set	2004-02-17	149	129	20

I have the book and the movie and wouldn't take a million dollars for either. The characters are so alive, so real. You are part of the story because you are absorbed into it. I find it quite tedious that people want to bring modern politics into an issue that is beyond the capability of the modern mind to grasp. First off it's only a movie, secondly Mrs. Mitchell's work was reproduced from stories she had collected or grew up hearing from those old southern grand-dames who actually REMEMBERED what it was like before, during and after the war. We all know now that slavery was wrong, but it WAS a fact of history. When it is put in a film like GWTW somehow people think that was/is being glorified. This is simply not the case, the story is being told from only one perspective. Most people with two ounces of a brain can figure this out. The story is not about Mammy's struggle to understand why the white folks boss her around. The story is about a spoiled selfish girl who finally grows up when she realizes that everything that could ever be important or dear to her has passed by.	5.0	You either get or you don't	2002-12-30	7	5	2

After all these years, I believe it's still the benchmark for epic storytelling on the big screen.  Research the production and put into perspective the time in which this  film was made, it's simply amazing. The film enraptures it's viewer and  never once do you lose interest.  From the opening scene of Scarlett and  her suitors on the back steps of Tara to the end scene of Scarlett avowing  to get back all that is hers... you are right there with her entirely.  Vivien Leigh portrayed Scarlett perfectly.  Clark Gable was simply amazing!  There has never been such a strong, masculine character portrayal the likes  of Gable as Rhett since! The entire casting of GWTW was perfect. The  costuming by Walter Plunkett is simply grand . . . who doesn't want the  ruby red dress that Scarlett wore to Ashley's party?

Wow. What an amazing book. No other book can make you love and hate a character at the exact same time. It will be hard to enjoy other books when you compare them to GWTW. So, after reading it i just HAD to watch the movie. I couldn't even finish it. It left out a lot from the book, and you didn't get to know the characters as well. I do realize that it was made in the late thirties, and that it would take hours and a narrator to include everything in the book, but it was still a disappointment. But if you liked the movie, you MUST read the book. Don't be scared by the size! And the first four hundred pages worth of actionless descriptions are necessary in order to lay a good foundation for the greatest story ever told. &lt;- and that is an understatement!!!

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ALTNI5BAFUAQY	"Jery Tillotson ""cult author"""	GONE WITH THE WIND is now 75 years old.It still has the power to astonish, thrill and touch the viewer as if it were released last week.There are so many layers ot brilliance here that you can watch it countless times--which I've done--and still be thrilled by its amazing freshness, power and beauty.We have a cast that gives it their all, especially the fabulous Vivien Leigh portraying the most fascinating and vibrant heroine in movie history: Scarlett O'Hara. It's Leigh who provides the backbone to the whole movie as we first see her girlish and glorious in her white organdy gown, sitting on the front steps of her home Tara with the Tarleton twins. Through nearly 4 hours, we are galvanized to watch her evolve through profound periods of her life: a flirtatious Southern belle, to motherhood, to nursing the dying in Atlanta, thru starvation, desperation and finally to the wife of her admirer, Rhett Butler. Clark Gable was at his peak when this movie was made and its easy to see why he was the number one male movie star in the world.While we enjoy the performers, there's all the other qualities which have made this movie legendary: fabulous musical score by Max Steiner, unforgettable costumes--especially the ladies' gowns--by Walter Pluket. Victor Fleming's direction (although he was helped by several other directors) the screenplay, make-up, hair-styles and of course the master of it all: David Selznick.In the numerous books written about this movie legend, all authors agree that it was Selznick who shaped the massive production and made sure it bore his 'look.&#34;He wanted a visually opulent look, with rich colors. For his performers, he demanded that the femme leads would not be creatures of the Hollywood look of glamour. He ordered new tests for natural looking make-up. The women would not wear the false lashes, layers of pancake and lipstick and mascara that women characters in Hollywood historical productions were prone to wear.The sets, the various locales, the use of shadows and especially the unforgettable lighting were all deep concerns for Selznick.Just look at the sequence when Scarlett enters a room at Tara fo find her mother's body, waiting for burial. The eerie greenish lighting, the music--complete with the beating of a heart--is just one of the majestic moments in a film that will be around for another thousand years.My only complaint is that the commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer is a travesty. Obviously reading from a script, he races through the movie giving the viewer a detailed account of each performer while his dialogue has nothing to do with the action on the screen.The worst moment: while we watch Scarlett O'Hara go a hill top and makes her vow: &#34;As God is my witness...&#34; Rudy is rapidly giving us the rundown on the life of Thomas Mitchell, who plays Scarlett's father! He gives us no comments about how complicated this sequence proved to be--the whole crew and Vivien Leigh had to visit this isolated area at 2 a.m. for several mornings to capture that blood-red sunset. Far better would have been to have the many experts on GWTW to help narrate the technical aspects of this spectacular production.All the main crew and cast members are now dead--with the eternal Olivia D'Haviland proving the exception.But we can always put this movie into our player and be thrilled once more at the movie miracle that David O. Selznick helped create on mostly the backlot of Selznick International Studio in 1939.	5.0	Fabulous Movie Magic That Never Grows old!	2013-11-14	3	1	2

I don't think they could have found a better actor (Clark Gable) to play Rhett Butler, boy was he handsome. I just wish Scarlett, the Sequel to Gone with the Wind, could have been written closer to the time of Gone with the Wind so that Clark could play Rhett again.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3MQ672FYFNM7B	JGC	It is an epic among epics and the standard by which all quality film is judged by. No one else could have portrayed Scarlett other than the beathtaking Vivien Leigh. Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland were both equally captivating. Mr. Clark Gable gave the performance of his lifetime and one that will never be forgotten. If you have any interest in this movie you will most assuredly appreciate the boxed set as it is wonderfully put together. This is a picture that must be seen.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2Q3BW3177V542	J. G. Morales	Personally, I'm intrigued by all things things old, sexist, and racist. Not because I'm sexist or racist, but I just find it interest to ... look back in time at accepted attitudes and representations in our world. I planned to watch Gone with the Wind just to see what all the fuss was about, but could never make the time. It was a year before I finally *made* the time, and that was only to see Hattie McDaniel's Oscar winning performance. I was curious.Well, this film most certainly has it's offensive moments. I also agree with another reviewer who said this is possibly more offensive than Birth of a Nation. Personally, however, I was still able to appreciate and enjoy the movie despite that fact. I didn't think I would, but I did! Personally, I'm from a diverse family that's racist in all directions anyway. I grew up around a lot of things that I had to learn to take in context (for lack of better way of putting). As such, I'm probably not as easily or deeply offended by some things as others are.However, I find it odd that anyone could give this movie a good review (this day and age) while overlooking the heavy racist sentiment throughout. Despite the racism, the story itself is still good. Sue me! A little ridiculous how dangerous falling down used to be, but otherwise lol a good movie if you view it accepting it for what it is.	5.0	Can't Believe I Liked This!	2014-02-27	1	1	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3J9LLWHZH15HG	JJ	I have the 2 disc set of GWTW but couldn't resist ordering this 4 disc set because of all the Special Features included.  I would like to say that the Special Features alone are worth the price.  You get a wonderful documentary of the stars and good shorter documentaries about all the players.  The &#34;Making of a Legend&#34; is as long as a movie and is extremely interesting. I've had that on VHS for many years and have looked at it many times.  I simply cannot believe what they have been able to do with this film in restoring it and, to me, making it even more beautiful that it was originally.  And, I saw it in Alabama in the early 40s. The feature where they explain how it was restored is very interesting.  The feature where they explain how cotton came to be king in the south and what the invention of the cotton gin did for the farmers is wonderfully interesting too.  I recommend this 4 disc set to any one and especially to GWTW fans. If I could give it l0 stars I would.	5.0	Ravishingly restored	2013-06-11	0	0	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A8F2AZWB20X1H	JLind555	"There has probably never been a movie as eagerly awaited as GWTW and it was released in 1939 to enormous hype.  It was billed as the greatest epic of all time, etc. etc.  Well, was it?  Threescore years and countless TV re-runs later has helped to put it into perspective, so let's see:WHAT'S RIGHT WITH IT:--Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.  Holy moly, what a pair!  Vivien Leigh was the perfect Scarlett O'Hara, and as for Clark Gable... who else could have played Rhett Butler?  And when these two are together, the sparks ignite the screen.--A great romantic tale.  We all know it already, so no rehash is needed.--A great war story.  The tension building up to the burning of Atlanta and the flight out of the city is almost unbearable.  And the panoramic pullback scene of the railroad tracks covered with war wounded is like a punch in the stomach -- we feel it on a visceral level -- and it shows as nothing else does the whole insanity of war.--Hattie McDaniel as Mammy.  Some people felt that the role itself was demeaning, and it was, but McDaniel invested it with a dignity that transcended the stereotype.  She won a well-deserved Oscar for best supporting actress.Which brings us to...WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT:--This is probably one of the most overtly racist films ever made with the possible exception of ""Birth of a Nation"".  It's not only racist, it's sexist as well.  It certainly reflects southern society in the 1860's, but it's painful to sit through at times.--Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes.  Gloriosky, what were they thinking of?  Ashley is supposed to be a stirring, romantic figure.  It's almost laughable to imagine a fireball like Vivien Leigh falling for this wimp.--A rambling, incoherent second half.  After the story moves back to Atlanta, it doesn't seem to have a clear focus.  It rambles and idles along at a snails pace and takes forever to get where it's going.All things considered, GWTW is still one of the most ambitious movies ever made.  Maybe that was its problem.  It could never have realized all its expectations, but it came fairly close."	4.0	Was it really that great?	2002-11-11	17	4	13
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1GDSLI1M4XHYJ	J. Love	One summer when I was a young girl, I read the book 8 times.  At that time, there weren't VHS or DVDs that you could rent or buy.  (Well, there probably were, but we were country folks.

Of course the two principal characters were less than perfect people--the beauty of the movie, all visual splendor aside, is the way it makes us care about  these sometimes horrible people. Who wants to see another movie with  cut-out characters who never waver in their ideals or morals? The  relationships in Gone With the Wind are sometimes messy and sometimes  infuriating, but never fail to be engaging.	5.0	Missing the point	2000-03-11	3	2	1

(Also great!).  But what I wouldn't understand is why they didn't put Scarlett having Wade Hamilton (her child from her first husband, Charles Hamilton), and Ella Kennedy (her child from her second husband, Frank Kennedy) in the movie.  I guess they wanted to portray how Scarlett really didn't care for her first 2 husbands, otherwise everyone would have thought she really cared.  But still they should have put her first 2 children in there.  They are still in the 2nd book (Scarlett) and because they weren't in the first movie, they couldn't be in the 2nd.  Other than that, I thought it was a great movie.  I loved how Rhett loved Scarlett so much he would do anything for her, but Scarlett was too stupid to appreciate it till the end.  And she was too ashamed to call for Rhett when she needed him for fear that he would not come to her.  But I guess they wrote it that way for excitement.  Oh well, I still consider this to be my favorite, all time, love story!!	5.0	EXCELLENT	2001-04-08	20	7	13

Since I first saw it as a teenager, I've been watching it at least once a year.  I absolutely love it!  Why?  I can't quite explain.  Scarlet is nothing more than a spoiled brat, but I can't help cheering for her at every frame.  Rhett deserves so much better, though he was not always the perfect gentleman you find at the end of the movie, but I still want to watch them get together and see all the fireworks!  This is about a time of change... it's not about slavery, like many others believe.  If you can get past that difficult subject and look at the movie as it was meant to be... a tale of two people, who belong together... but their personalities, desires, and ideals of what is proper continues to tear them apart.  Then when it looks like they will finally be happy... an unthinkable act will again pull them from each other.	5.0	Classic romance!!!	2001-10-15	0	0	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1NP3OU0YILKSR	Joel Cobbs	"One of the greatest films of all time, GWTW is a fascinating depiction of Southern life during and after the Civil War.  This review, however, is for the product, not the film.  I give the product four out of five stars for the following reasons:1) This edition comes with many extras, even a recreation of the program used 70 years ago.  Also included is a sample of the original motion picture soundtrack and roughly eight hours worth of bonus features, including documentaries, commentary, and more.  While the product description mentions ten 5""x7"" water color pictures (which it does include), it also comes with recreated telegrams, letters and more from the cast, crew and production company.2) The film transfer is beautifully done.  The film flows smoothly and is featured on two DVDs.  While that is rather annoying, having to get up and change DVDs or wait as the player automatically shifts between the two, that sacrifice for the beauty of the film is well worth it.3) The price is rather high for what you get.  I love the film and had no problem paying the money for it, but the price is still rather high.  Taking into account all the facts that there are only 150,000 copies out there, the price seems rather reasonable for such a ""rare"" item.  Even with that, it's still rather high.All in all, definitely worth the value you put into it.  One quick side note here before I finish.  The film IS presented in original format, which is FULLSCREEN.  Films prior to 1953 were not shown in theaters in what we now know as WIDESCREEN.  This was developed in the early fifties during the television boom to help add to the experience movie-goers wanted.  EVEN WITH THAT IN MIND, the set is great and I highly recommend it.(CAPS WORDS are used for emphasis, not yelling.)"	4.0	Epic	2009-11-18	11	8	3

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A10ODC971MDHV8	John Farr	"One of the world's most cherished and enduring pictures, ""Wind"" was birthed in the mind of novelist Margaret Mitchell and incubated by the brilliant, obsessive David O. Selznick, who spared no expense in bringing this powerful, affecting story to the big screen. The ultra-lavish production features ornate costumes and art design, jaw-dropping set pieces and historical sequences (especially the burning of Atlanta, for which a Hollywood set was torched), all wrapped around the story of a resourceful, if not likable, heroine.

It's great entertainment for sure, and the multiple restorations have made it more and more stunning to see over the years.  I haven't yet seen the Blu-Ray version, which may well be even better, but I don't hesitate in recommending this version.	5.0	Better Than Ever	2013-10-03	1	1	0
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3MC59SV2I382J	John M. Bentley II	The first time I saw this film I was 14 years old.  I knew nothing about it at the time, but was told I had to see it because it was a CLASSIC.  That day I fell head-over-heels in love with Vivien Leigh and Gone With The  Wind.  To date, I have seen the movie over 37 times and it never gets old.  That first viewing was in CinemaScope, I saw it much later in the restored  format and loved it even more.  The last time I saw it in a theatre was at  the Fabulous Fox Theatre here in Atlanta, GA which is where Margaret  Mitchell lost her life crossing the street by a hit-and-run driver.  It  remains a testament to Hollywood magic and true screenwriting of the past.  If Hollywood attempted to make this film now, it would be so bad that I  wouldn't even watch it.  The grandeur that is reflected in this epic of the  Civil War and the aftermath of Reconstruction is by far the best I've ever  seen.  If you've ever seen an Atlanta sunrise or sunset, you would  understand how much research William Cameron Menzies did to capture so  precisely the colors and splendor of nature.This film appeals to all  age groups and never seems dated.  The acting is first-rate and the story  is one that will always stand the test of time.  No film library is  complete without this addition.  Seeing it on DVD for the first time, I was  astounded by the sharpness and clarity of the picture.  Actually, I orderd  this DVD even BEFORE I bought my DVD play just so that it would be the  first DVD I ever watched.....pure eye candy!	5.0	World's Greatest Film	1999-12-28	6	4	2
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A12WDZ8Y7XQBNS	John Moon	I'm very happy to see that this classic among classic's is finally getting a better DVD release, the previous DVD did not to justice to this movie, and I've been hoping for a while that Warner Brothers would release this as one of their famous Two-disc DVD's.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3H7HJ8O42U70Z	"""johntchance"""	I'm always sure I've seen this move enough, but I got caught up in it again this past weekend.  Too bad it's gotten the reputation as a chick flick, because I think its pretty universal.  The war is a background to the human story that rises above mere soap opera.  Gable is perfect as Rhett Butler, Vivian Leigh was brilliant as Scarlett and Olivia DeHavilland never strikes a false note.  Leslie Howard on the other hand seems miscast and I always hope that he'll be replaced before I view it again.The Gone With the Wind DVD is somewhat of a disappointment.  With a very good making of documentary already produced, I was very disappointed that it didn't make its way onto this DVD.  I suppose once they sell the tar out of this one, we'll get a special collectors edition that we can buy all over again.  Next time I hope we can have some commentary by film scholars.  There is so much to tell us about this great film.  There is a Deluxe Box set available, but it has nothing but play pretties.  I long for substance.	4.0	Good Movie - Bare DVD	2003-02-20	17	14	3

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A22BPC7LRSGSYQ	Joker	So much has already been written about this epic classic that I want to just give a few thoughts on this David O. Selznick movie...Gone With The Wind (1939) won 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  That pretty much sums up the quality of this epic romance/war movie about the Old South during the American Civil War, based on the novel by Margaret Mitchell.While I do think some of the actors over-acted at times (especially Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara), the acting overall is great.  Clark Gable was at the peak of his career.  The cinematography is great, as is the musical score by Max Steiner.  The color is amazing.  I like the overall atmosphere, feel, and lighting throughout the movie.  The clouds, the sunsets, the trees, the fires, the camera angles, etc. all contribute to an overall epic and dramatic feel.  The costumes/wardrobes are outstanding as well.  Is this movie a 100% accurate portrayal of life in the Old South during the Civil War?  That's debatable and up to the knowledgeable viewer to judge, but no matter what, it's a great epic and entertaining movie that clocks in at 3 hours and 53 minutes.  This is a three-DVD set that includes a a well done documentary on the making of the movie, made in 1988.  The movie has optional commentary from film historian Rudy Behlmer as well.If you're in the mood for watching some classics from the late 1930s and early 1940s, then this is a great one from that era.  If you've never seen it, see it.  Others I like from this era are The Wizard Of Oz (1939) and another Academy Award-winning David O. Selznick picture, Rebecca (1940).	5.0	Everyone should see this movie some time in their lifetime	2012-01-18	1	1	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A25CQTB313XDWO	"JON STRICKLAND ""Jon Strickland"""	A wonderful 1939 classic that has been on DVD since 1999, Gone with the Wind is often regarded as the greatest movie of all time, having won an astounding total of 10 Academy Awards. This motion picture, alone, has set so many standards for theatrical producers in the realms of: acting, producing, directing, photography, editing, and screenplay. It is, without doubt, at least one of the five most significant films ever.Just as Steven Spielberg came to regard director David Lean (Doctor Zhivago, Lawrence of Arabia, etc.) as a, if not the, primary role model in terms of how to direct and produce, David Lean, in turn, very likely looked up to Gone with the Wind director Victor Fleming as both a source and standard of how a motion picture was to be made, especially where epics were concerned.Gone with the Wind, for obvious reasons, laid the foundation for other great films that would later come to be and was an expensively made film during its time. However, 1939 was not a year where many special effects were available. Despite the reality of this limitation, it seemed as if Fleming and the production crew knew exactly when and where each scene was to be laid out.Where the special effects were not added, the simple elements of nature were used as perfect enhancers for the cinematography of each sequence throughout. Where latter-day movies might include computer graphics, bright costumes, and flashy jewelry to add to their elegance, the making of Gone with the Wind used prevalent, prominent landscape settings. For instance, the intermittent filming of the pastel colors of late-afternoon and early-evening skies created silhouettes that set the mixed tones of both the Confederacy's finest and darkest hours.Combined and synchronized with the wonderful theme music by Max Steiner and the human elements played out by a superb cast, the luminescent indoor and outdoor sceneries that consisted of candlelight and shadows seemed to further set in the mood. And perhaps it is because of this total packaging that film critic Leonard Maltin has come to regard Gone with the Wind as &quot;the pinnacle of Hollywood moviemaking&quot;.	5.0	A Sweeping Civil War-Era Production	2002-10-14	7	3	4

It was truly amazing and sometimes beautiful.  The acting was also pretty good.  However, the plot was just not that entertaining and very very long.  Scarlett's character never develops, it just stays the same, which is boring to see over four hours.  None of the characters really go through any changes they are all just as stationary at the end as they were four hours before.To top that off the movie was an absolute tradgedy, but I found myself not knowing whether to laugh or cry.  They just acted so dramatic about everything and though the movie was long so many tragic things happened on after the other I could have been watching a soap opera.Maybe it was funny to me because I was in ""Hooray for Hollywood"" at my highschool and there was a girl in the play trying to be dramatic and recite a monologue on all the scenes in Gone With the Wind in one minute.  It really ended up being closer to four, but it was much more enjoyable and you got the whole plot in four minutes and you knew that Scarlett was self-centered and the other characters don't really matter because they are bland and boring and Scarlett is really all anyone should care about anyway.

Played simultaneously (blu on samsung player, dvd on sony 'upscale'). MY opinions (and please don't add hateful comments if you disagree ...): even on a 50"" 720p LCD projection, picture quality is improved (colors more striking,increased clarity. Can only surmise  improvement on 1080p tv), entire 4 hr film on 1 disc -incl. overture and intermission-, audio options are many (english -mono and HD-, and dubs in spanish,german,french,italian,portuguese. Also commentary track), subtitle options even more (to above languages add swedish,'nld',danish,finnish,norwegian). RE: blu packaging (single disc): nothing fancy, with artwork that is similar to 65th box, and blu case with plastic cut-outs. I plan on placing blu disc in paper sleeve, and putting it in sleeve of multi-fold box set. That way, I still have all original extra features (single blu disc just has film), will keep very nice 65th box set, yet have upgraded film copy (total spent: $28).Recommendations: IF this is a favorite film, and you appreciate blu technology, invest the ten bucks (I consider it well spent for a 4 hr classic film). IF you appreciate the film in a fairly recent edition -not blu-, and don't 'need' another copy, then save your money! ALSO: unlike many other blu titles I own, this one DOES have 'resume' feature; and scene selections ARE available: just look for the correct menu button on remote.... and again, this 1939 film was filmed in 1.33:1, so true picture is of 'square', not wide, format ('widescreen' tv's are fairly recent phenomena. Old theater screens -and subsequent televisions- were square! On a modern tv, in blu-ray, side bars are a deeper black, so less a distraction).UPDATE: Hopefully, final 'GWTW' purchase will be the ""Scarlett edition"", which I purchased for the included 6 hr MGM documentary, ""When the Lion Roars"". NOTE: 3 disc set (single width case, within identical slipcase) includes prev. detailed blu-ray film, a second blu disc of 8 hrs of extras IN STANDARD DEF (incl. all from 65th ann. box ""plus 3 hrs new to the collection""), and disc #3 of 2-sided standard def disc of MGM doc. I paid $20 for this set ('like new'), which is what the ""Lion Roars"" cost by itself! P.S. Found a good home for single blu, and re-couped the $10!

Leaving out Scarlet's other children was just fine with me.  My reason for only four stars is the casting of Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes.  In the book, Ashley is a tall, young, strong, and very handsome southern gentleman.  As good as an actor that Howard was, he does not even come close to fitting the description; the documentary showing how much makeup it took just to get him to look younger is revealing.  For me, he looks and acts just like the wimp he played in Of Human Bondage!  It is said that he took the role because he was promised a directorial job in the future which may or may not have occurred if he had not died in the plane that was shot down in 1943 by German aircraft.  C'est tout.  I have perused the various reviews concerning the aspect ratio.  I am old enough to be thoroughly acquainted with the subject, but I have a question.  My standard DVD (the latest before the hi def) looks quite good on a 71' widescreen TV, but the light gray sidebars are extremely disracting.  Does the new issue have the sidebars, and,  if so, are they black so as not to distract?	4.0	Almost perfect.	2004-12-17	0	0	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3OIBSI40QBOX	Justin (gmtar@capital.net)	It is impossible to imagine a film that is in any way better than Gone With The Wind.  I am only 16 years old, but I adore this movie.  I have yet to see a film that surpasses GWTW.  The camerawork, the screenplay, the  sets, the sound, the score, and the costumes are by far the most amazing  and detailed creations in Hollywood's long history.  If anyone can name a  movie that comes even close to the achievements and the spectacle of Gone  With The Wind please tell me.  I also read the book and plan to read it  again.  The novel is also amazing-its hard to believe that a 1,047 page  book could actually be a nonstop pageturner.  On school nights I would stay  up to all hours just to read it.  And the movie, I watch it every 1 to 2  weeks...I can't get enough of it.  I listen to the soundtrack constantly.  This movie is by far the greatest...No other motion picture has captivated  me so profoundly.  The actors cast in this movie are so real...every time I  watch this movie I feel like I am in a room in a Southern plantation house  in the 1860's watching Scarlett and Rhett converse with each other.  I hope  that on Oscar night they pay huge reverence to this movie.  No other film  deserves such accolade...I was so elated over the summer when I saw that  GWTW topped the charts for a week earning the same amount it did in  unadjusted dollars in 1939.  Although nothing rivals this film's appearance  in the movie theaters this edition on VHS is incredible.  I love this movie  and hopefully there will be companies in the future that will constantly  resurrect this incredible film...A movie like this should not slip away.  Happy Gone With The Wind watching everyone!!  P.S. And if you don't like  the movie- well-&quot;Frankly, my dear I don't give a damn!&quot;	5.0	By far the greatest achievement of motion picture history!	1998-11-27	2	2	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1QL50VCJPBQCL	JW	&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; seems beyond criticism, so central is it to the mythos of American filmmaking. It's huge, grand, sweeping, ambitious, diligent, and a little stupid around the edges. But it's certainly an eye-  and earful. Consider it a guilty pleasure.Note to some critics of the  DVD: Many have carped that the DVD is short on extras: True enough. But a  widescreen version isn't one of them. Like virtually all films of its time,  GWTW was shot using an aspect ratio that was pretty close to that of the  modern tv screen. In the 1960's the film was rereleased in a widescreen  version that was created by lopping off information at the top and the  bottom of each frame; in other words, the new version contained less visual  info than the old and pretty much wrecked the original's meticulous  composition and art direction. It's a joke, and it doesn't belong on the  DVD.	4.0	Great movie-movie? Yup. Work of art? Hmmm...	1999-05-14	4	2	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A385G17CKI2MLS	Kari	Gone With the Wind is one of the most famous movies of all time.  It's a classic and SUCH a great movie.  The DVD has a great quality picture.  I only have 2 complaints:1) It's one of the greatest movies of all time.  You'd THINK that the DVD would have some kind of extras like behind the scenes or footage from the premiere, since it was such a big deal.  I was so disappointed to find out that there was nothing of the sort!2) Half the movie is on one side of the DVD and half is on the other.  It gets annoying having to flip sides, but maybe it's not possible to have it all on one side because the movie is so long...I don't know the technical side of it.  I just know it's annoying.Other than that, great movie.  A definite must see for EVERYONE.	4.0	Great movie, but you think there'd be more!	2003-05-13	2	1	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1TYY3DRR8FRN7	"Karla R. ""MovieJunkie"""	Were the words Rhett Butler once told Scarlett O'Hara. And that's how I felt the first time I ever witness such splendor of a movie. Gone With The Wind is iconic for one reason, and it's because the moment the movie is over you can concur with that line; that you just witness an historic moment, you feel that you just finished watching the greatest movie ever made, it doesn't matter if you are 12, 20 or 60 years old you still feel it.But enough about the movie, since if you are hesitating in purchasing this amazing collector's edition you already know all this.The gift box is amazing, if you cannot get enough of the 4-disc special edition or you just love to have all this extra stuff, then this is for you.Gone With The Wind is my favorite movie, and this is my 3rd purchase of it, I first purchased the VHS when I was a teenager at the end of the 90's, then I upgraded it to the 4-disc DVD edition, and now that this one is out, of course I just couldn't resist it.The Perfect gift to that special someone you know that loves the movie, and a great add-on to a loyal fan's collection that likes knit-knacks.	5.0	"""Take a good look my dear.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AVZ8NX1P8QPCG	"Katie Carter ""Kodaprn"""	"""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.""You have probably heard the above quote 50 million times, but I don't give a damn.  It's the most famous movie quote of all time, and it came from one of the most famous movies of all time, Gone with the Wind,  based on the classic book by Margaret Mitchell.  It's from a movie that won 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture in 1939.  It's from a movie that, when the American Film Institute came up with a list of the top 100 movies of all time, came in fourth.  And, most of all, it's from a movie that will be remembered forever.Gone with the Wind takes place in the state of Georgia, from before the Civil War starts until Reconstruction and after.  The story revolves around young Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled and selfish Southern belle who lives in a beautiful plantation with her parents, slaves, and somewhat annoying sisters.  Scarlett has a beauty and charm about her that seems to hypnotize all the men in the county, but she doesn't want any of them.  No, the man she loves is about to marry his cousin.Scarlett spends the whole movie chasing after Ashley Wilkes, despite the fact that the much more dashing Rhett Butler is head over heels for her.  But Scarlett endures many more hardships than that.  She leaves her home to go to Atlanta, and barely escapes with her life as she and Rhett get out of the city while it's burning.  She comes home to find her plantation destroyed, and, after nearing starvation, vows never to be hungrey again.  She suddenly doesn't even have the money to pay for her home, and must marry for the cash.The story really takes shape and Scarlett's social status significantly changes when she marries the rich Rhett (her third marriage), but is still in love with Ashley.  The rest of the movie is pretty much her and him bickering.  But I don't want to give away the ending.  Let's just say, if you haven't read the book and don't know what happens, it's a plot twister.There are several memorable scenes in this movie that wonderfully depict the Civil War in Atlanta.  In one part, Scarlett walks past hundreds and hundreds of injured soldiers lying on the ground.  That scene will probably stay with me forever.And of course, the cast really makes this movie what it is.  The lovely Vivien Leigh was a perfect Scarlett O'Hara, and Clark Gable was an even better Rhett.  Ashley Wilkes is played by Leslie Howard, and his wife Melanie played by Olivia de Havilland.  At the beginning of the movie, future Superman George Reeves makes an appearance as Stuart Tarleton.This movie is magnificent, a true treasure, a story of the hardships of the southerners during the Civil War brought to life."	5.0	Story of the South	2005-12-09	15	11	4

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1F1IB3JXH8CQM	Kaylie	"Gone with the WindOn December 15th, 1939, a film that won ten Academy Awards and became an all time classic was released. This famous movie is called Gone with the Wind. Writing this original story was a woman named Margaret Mitchell, she was a first time novelist who took a chance and wrote a love story with a setting during the Civil War. Her book was made into a film and it was directed by Victor Flemming, George Cukor, and Sam Wood. Gone with the Wind was produced by David O' Selznick. Although this movie was made in 1939 when things were cheaper, it was very popular and managed to pull in $6,960,259. The main actors include Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard, and Olivia de Havilland. Gone with the Wind has very interesting characters, an important setting, an exciting plot, and a theme that stands out immensely. It is rated ""G"" and is a must see for everyone.The story lands us in a setting in Georgia during the Civil War, with characters that have distinct personalities. The main character, Scarlett O'Hara, is played by Vivien Leigh. Self-absorbed, bratty, shallow, and immature could be perfect ways to describe her. She is in love with a man named Ashley Wilkes, but Rhett Butler loves her. Since she has such a sour personality, Scarlett O'Hara makes a lot of mistakes throughout her life, but she surprisingly doesn't learn anything from them! Her family and her live on a plantation named Tara. Nearby is another plantation called Twelve Oaks. This is owned by Ashley Wilkes, whom Scarlett loves. His character is played by Leslie Howard and is portrayed as a good-natured, honest man. He is calm, has high morals, and is well liked. Instead of Scarlett O'Hara who is infatuated with him, Ashley marries a woman named Melanie Hamilton. She is repeatedly thoughtful throughout the movie, and is also caring, genuine, and loving. Her character is played by Olivia de Havilland. Scarlett is very jealous of her, but ends up marrying a man named Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler loves Scarlett, but Scarlett doesn't feel quite as strongly about him. Rhett is played by Clark Gable and his character is very self-confident. He is not shy and talks straight-forward about things. He is a very rich man. All main characters in Gone with the Wind are on the south side of the Civil War and they all live in mansion like houses. The characters are important and they lead to an interesting plot.The plot of this movie is very exciting and you never have an uneventful moment. In the beginning, Scarlett O'Hara is living on a plantation and is planning to marry the nearby Ashley Wilkes, who she loves. She then soon finds out that he was recently engaged to Melanie Hamilton, without her knowing. Scarlett continues to flirt with Ashley and other men in hopes that Ashley will leave his wife. While at a party, a man comes by and says that the enlistment is open for men to go into the army and fight in the war. Before the war, a man named Charles Hamilton asks Scarlett to marry him and Scarlett says yes because she is jealous and wants Ashley to love her. Charles goes to war and dies. Scarlett then meets Rhett and at first, doesn't like him much, but they continue to talk nonetheless. Scarlett and Melanie end up going to Atlanta to be nurses for the injured men in the war. During that time, Melanie was pregnant and due soon. She ended up going into labor. Scarlett for once, puts her jealousy aside and helps birth the child. Melanie and Scarlett realize that they can no longer stay in the town because it is too dangerous. They travel back to Tara. When back at Tara, Scarlett learns that her mother has died. In the middle of the movie, Scarlett's father also dies is an accident. Rhett keeps showing up and telling Scarlett he loves her, but Scarlett is still too obsessed with Ashley to want Rhett. Scarlett then marries a man named Frank Kennedy who her sister actually likes. Frank likes Scarlett's sister too, but Scarlett gets him to marry her because she wants his money. Things are fine until Scarlett gets attacked in the woods. The men (Rhett, Ashley, and Frank) go out to kill whoever did this to Scarlett. Frank dies and Scarlett starts to feel a little bit bad. In the end, Rhett asks Scarlett to marry him and Scarlett does. She likes Rhett but still loves Ashley and Rhett knows this. They have a child together named Bonnie and Rhett loves her and spoils her. One day Bonnie tries to show Scarlett and Rhett a trick on her horse but she falls off, breaks her neck, and dies. Everyone is devastated. Rhett and Scarlett begin to feel that they have nothing left so Rhett divorces Scarlett to let her be with Ashley. Scarlett then realizes that she doesn't love Ashley anymore, but it's too late. Rhett leaves her. Scarlett goes back to Tara to find a way to win Rhett back. As you can see, there is never a dull moment in this crazy love story.Although the movie may seem like it is only a crazy, whirlwind love story, it actually has a very important theme. The main theme of Gone with the Wind is to appreciate what you have before it is too late. There are two main places in which this applies in the movie. The first is with Scarlett's home, Tara. Scarlett had a beautiful home on a plantation. Her family had lots of property and a huge house. Scarlett never really appreciated it while she lived there. She took it for granted, thinking it would always be there for her. Little did she know, while she was away working as a nurse for the war, the north's soldiers came through and burnt the land and trashed the house. Scarlett was really upset with what happened because she loved her home and wanted it to be a place that she could come to, to feel safe. In addition to this, another place in the movie where this theme applies is with Rhett Butler. Rhett always loved Scarlett. He treated her well, bought things for her, and married her. Scarlett, however, took this for granted. She never really paid much attention to Rhett, for she was too obsessed with Ashley. Unfortunately Scarlett didn't see what she had. She finally realized that she actually loved Rhett when it was too late. He was tired of her loving Ashley and taking him for granted. Rhett left Scarlett, but as he was leaving, Scarlett wanted him back. Scarlett took both her home and Rhett for granted and didn't appreciate them until it was too late.My opinion of this movie was a very good one. Usually I don't like older movies much. They tend to bore me quite easily. Gone with the Wind was exactly the opposite however. I liked the romance aspect of it. Although it was a pretty typical love story, it held my interest because of all the other side conflicts that were going on as well. By the first half of the movie, I already knew that I liked it. Enough had gone on to make a very interesting story line and I couldn't wait to watch more! I would recommend this movie to everyone because of the eventful setting, distinctive characters, roller coaster plot, and significant theme. I really enjoyed this movie."	5.0	Movie Review	2011-06-19	2	1	1

The cinematography is majestic, reminding us of the epics that Hollywood used to make--""Ben Hur (1959),"" and ""The Ten Commandments (50th Anniversary Collection)."" The pacing is superb, and as well done as the best episodes of ""24: Seasons 1-7."" After an hour, I felt like I had seen two hours. And the film keeps this up for four hours. There is much that this film can teach film school undergrads.The setting, however, is a double-edged sword. As the title-card indicates, this film s a glamorization of the Antebellum South. So we get the Code of Honor, dignity, propriety, Southern Hospitality, and all the good things of a refined society. But we also get the slave stereotypes. They are both laughable and sad. However, if you pay close attention, the slaves/freedmen are some the most noble characters in the story. Mammie has the best head on her shoulders.This film's weakest point is characterization. Rhett is both a Han SoloStar Wars: The Han Solo Adventures (Classic Star Wars)and aCasablancaRick character, a cultured Wolverine who lives by his own code of ethics, but also can be a good person if need be.Men take note: this is what women want out of a man--rich, dashing, tall, dark, handsome, living by his own code of ethics, putting up with their catty remarks, pampering their wives. And did I mention rich?(This is the prototypical chick-flick. Guys, I suggest readingWar and Peace (Barnes & Noble Classics).)We have reams of research about the unreal standards men have for women. But what about the unreasonable expectations women have for men? (Spreading Misandry: The Teaching of Contempt for Men in Popular CultureandLegalizing Misandry: From Public Shame to Systemic Discrimination Against Men)For her part, Scarelett is an abomination. For the first half of the film, she is an immature, self-absorbed, pouting tease. In the second half of the film, she is an immature, self-absorbed, pouting gold-digger. She focuses on being the center of attention at parties, complains that her widow's garb makes her look unfashionable, and stops childbearing because it adds two inches on to her waist.""As for my people, children are their oppressors.""Her greatest folly is her view of love and romance. She loves A, and never comes to terms that she cannot have a married man (Rhett's comment about Ashley's double-standard of fidelity is well-placed), so she marries B out of spite. As a war-widow, she puts off C's advances (Rhett), and marries D, for his money and business. A widow again, she finally marries C (Rhett), who, to his credit, gives up his blockade-ruining and settles down to domestic bliss. But she still pines away for A. Got it?Rhett suggests that they divorce, so she can have the love she really desires, but Scarlett declines, citing the scandal.But she admits she still loves A, and when his wife dies, Rhett feels threatened, so she changes her mind again, and wants to stay with Rhett.Like Kevin Federline (Mr. Britney Spears #2,Playing with Fire), Rhett has the better head on his shoulders and leaves. We wish he had left Scarlett sooner.Scarlett does have redeemable characteristics. She delivers a baby in burning Atlanta, holds her family together during Reconstruction--becoming a surrogate mother to her younger sisters and addled father. She has spunk and grit, but these emerge in survival or selfish situations. But when it comes to love, marriage, and motherhood, she remains forever a pouty fourteen-year-old.(And people think Robotech's Minmei is bad! Sheesh!)We focus on that one famous word at the end of the movie, but there are other problem areas. There are a lot of underwear scenes--the laughable old-fashioned bloomers, but it did began a trend.Then there is the Up The Staircase scene. Um, as they depicted it, Scarlett seemed to enjoy it. What type of message are sending to women???And what message are we sending to women about romance and love? Scarlett's one motivation is her love--puppy-love, really--for Ashley. In this aspect, she is as monomaniacally obsessed as Captain Ahab. She is not a person, just an unmet need.Also, there is a more insidious message--the importance of dealing with life's harsh, but empowering realities. She had three husbands, but that was not enough. Like King David, she coveted the poor person's lambling. She never accepts this empowering reality, and so she never grew up. She spent her days discontented and mopey.The ending is appropriate. Rhett reads the handwriting on the wall, and packs up. Scarlett, the perpetual fickle teenager, pleas ""If you go, where shall I go? What shall I do?""This is a perversion of Ruth's plea to Naomi: ""Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.""I think this highlights the inverted ethics of this film. The film is beautiful to watch and well executed, but the ethical framework is an eyesore."	2.0	Run-Around Scarlett	2009-09-09	39	5	34

Wonderful production from the days when digital special effects were absent...a masterpiece of film production.  If you've read the original book, it's hard not to be impressed by how effectively this film has captured the essential essence of the plot and the characters.  Of course there are things that are left out, given the social standards of 1939 but overall, this film does a wonderful job of capturing the spirit of the original novel.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A4GB8I8ACS4PM	"Kevin Pepper ""JedeyeNite"""	"OK, now we all know that this is like the best movie ever made, right???  Good, then I don't have to go into the movie at all.  That leaves me time to discuss this new blu-ray collector's set of the best damn movie ever filmed.  Let's get started as if we're just opening this box set.Outer box:As soon as you get the plastic wrap off, you're going to want to rub your hands along the smooth red velvet that covers the entire box.  You'll notice the title ""Gone With the Wind"" embossed in gold foil along all four sides of the box, and the front is a recessed image from the famous burning of Atlanta scene with the words, ""Gone With the Wind"" in raised gold lettering.  Just the outer box is enough to illicit a slight gasp.Opening the lid:Now let's lift the hinged lid, and what's that I see???? The lid is secured to opening no greater than a 90 degree angle with two black strap that are attached to the lid and the inside of the bottom tray.  Oh! my my!!  Who's that I see??  Why fiddle dee dee, it's Scarlet O'hara herself gracing the inside lid with a beautiful photo from the set showing her sitting on a fence in a white belle gown, with Tara in the background.  Now our eyes are drawn to what is actually inside the box.Inside the box:We look down to see a hardcover book with a black cover showing Rhett, Scarlett, and Tara in silhouette with the sky shaded a blazing orange and red.  The book is a top notch production with glorious black and white and color photos throughout.  There are also lots of concept drawings, costumed designs, and behind-the-scenes illustrations.  Now we lifts a black ribbon on the side which lifts the book and the other extra contents out of the box.  Now we see the reproduction of the original program given out at the premiere.  Now if you have the 4-disc DVD collector's set, this is the same reproduction as enclosed there with the nice exception of being full sized. The larger size really adds to the quality of this program.  The other printed bonuses may or may not appeal to some.  What you'll find is a collection of different communiques between the filmmakers and the various production agents.  It does provide some interesting insight into the feelings about the movie as it was in production.The Meat:OK, now we finally get to what we bought this for in the first place.  Oh.....wait......I really did want all the previous stuff, so I guess for some this may just be the icing on the cake.  The final two items in the set are a CD sampler and the blu-ray edition of the movie.  The CD Sampler is housed in a very handsome CD case, and clocks in at a little over 30 minutes of Alex North's wonderful soundtrack for this film.  It leaves you wanting more, but it's a nice addition to the set.  Now for the final course....the movie.  The movie is on one blu-ray disc, and the picture is absolutely stunning.  I've never seen this movie look so fresh and vibrant.  Warner should get an award for their recent remastering of some classic films; Casablanca, and Wizard of Oz to name a few.  The sound here will leave you breathless.  The orchestral score at the beginning and throughout sounds better than I've ever heard it.  There is no edition that you currently own that can come close to the quality of the newly remastered high-def image and sound.  There is another blu-ray disc full of supplemental material.  I believe that all of the content from the 4-disc DVD is included here.  There may be something missing, but it appeared to be everything to me.  Even if there is something missing, you won't miss it, because there are three hours worth of new extra features that are included here for the first time.  First is a great documentary that originally aired on TCM, called ""1939: Hollywoood's Greatest Year"".  If you missed out on the original broadcast, here's your chance to see this wonderful documentary.  It truly is amazing how many classic films were released during this year.  You also get a new featurette titled, ""Gone With the Wind: The Legend Lives On"".  Finally, there is a made for TV movie ""The Scarlett O'Hara War"" that dramatizes the search for an actress to play Scarlett.Finally:As if we don't already have enough to warrant purchase, we are presented with 10 watercolor 5 x 7 cards of different production shots.  Each of these is printed on quality stock, and is worthy of being framed.WHEW!!!!!!  OK, that's about it.  Any collector of classic films owes it to himself to get this stunningly beautiful collector's set.  The quality of everything enclosed will leave you stunned.  You definitely get your money's worth with this set.  Bravo to Warner for presenting this very important film in a way that exudes quality and class."	5.0	I Don't Know Nuthin' 'bout Birthin No Babies, but I know a MUST HAVE Blu-ray set when I see one!!	2010-01-26	11	9	2
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ALPJ3L258ZJJ9	Kevin Vicente	"After much hype and inflated expectations, Gone With the Wind Really nearly lived up to its hype, as a reviewer from Yorktown called it, as ""one of the best movies ever made"".  The cinematography and acting were simply superb keeping this very lengthy drama gripping in its own silky Southern way.  The movie depicts a distinctly Southern view of the days before, after, and during the Civil War.  Truly for woman like Scarlet O'Hara and Southern gentlemen like Ashley, the ""end of the war...[was] the end of our world"".  Gone With the Wind was truly a cinematic world that represented what the Scarlets and Ashleys, if they were alive today, would recall.  Happy slaves, parties for the ladies, and honor pervaded their society.  The reality of a movie is not, not should it be, called history.  There is much to learn from the movie and how it represents interactions amongst peoples, north and south, and races, black and white.  However, this is a movie, made for entertainment and it fulfills that duty marvelously.  Gone With the Wind is a must see not only for entertainment, but also to see how its historical representations have become a part of our society, regardless of whether they are true or not."	5.0	Gone With the Wind?	2001-11-20	4	4	0

There is only one scene where blood is actually shown, for those of you who are skittish, but hey, it doesn't look like blood even, it looks like chocolate syrup, so it shouldn't be too disturbing. And also, it is about the Civil War, so there is going to be some tradgedy, folks! Anyway, Vivien Leigh is EXCELLENT as the spoiled, self-centered Scarlett O'Hara ...and Clark Gable is also very good as Rhett Butler. Hattie McDaniel was very good as Mammy,and I think she deserved her Oscar. She is often criticised for her portrayal of the maid, but I don't know if they realized that roles for black actresses were pretty much limited to maids, unfortunatly. The actress who played Melanie is fabulous, and the whole movie is really good. There is something for everyone. So, go out there, and if you aren't sure you'll like it, rent it.

I will not comment on the restoration process or the pros and cons of buying the 2-disk or 4-disk set, as this is adequately discussed by many other reviewers.  I will say that this movie won 10 Academy awards and is still regarded as the 6th best epic movie of all-time.  That should be credentials enough to want to view this extraordinary movie.Watching this movie is an absolutely delightful experience, and I can just imagine attending the movie in the theatre for the first time!  I can just imagine the excitement and the buzz of conversation during the intermission, for the first half of this movie is quite unlike any other movie up to that date in time.  This is a visual experience on film unlike any other.  The cinematography is what amazed me.  The magnificence of the sets, the lighting, the dramatic closing shots of scenes, and the sheer enormity of the film floors the viewer.  I will never forget the camera shot of Scarlett looking for the doctor in the streets of Atlanta, going from wounded soldier to wounded soldier as the camera slowly backs away revealing the enormity of the wounded lying in the streets as Sherman's cannons bomb the city to flames.  Similarly, there is also the shot of Scarlett declaring at Tara (her planation home) that she would never go hungry again.  The sky backdrop is so vividly lit, and the indomitable spirit of life that resides in Scarlett's chin-up, upright silhouette speaks volumes about her ability to survive the war and the destruction of her beloved Tara.Gone With The Wind is one of the greatest films of all-time as it transcends time itself.  It is still as relevant today as it was in 1939 (the greatest year in film history by the way, as The Wizard of Oz and Mr. Smith Goes To Washington were also released this year). It is truly an epic of epic proportions, the best of its day by a wide margin, and not to be eclipsed for decades.This is a wonderful movie experience; one you will never forget.

Not only cinema wise was the movie ahead of its time, but it gave a true picture of what the Civil War era was about given that they could only show so much back in 1939.  Just because the film betrays Margaret Mitchell's novel to the core does not make it a horrific film.  It was the first film where women and blacks were actually betrayed as strong and intelligent not weak and inferior.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ	Larry Scantlebury	You know, the thing about Gone With the Wind (hereinafter GWTW)that is both subtle and powerful, is that here, in the age of technology, when you have wireless access to your computer on your hand held telephoone, where Amazon brings hundreds of thousands of reviewers, watchers, critics, listeners and readers together, GWTW still commands 600 reviews.Really, to say the movie is racist or historically inaccurate probably should mean, after nearly 80 years, that it was a brilliantly crafted product of its time and should not be punished for keeping in step with what at that time society demanded. We should also remember that one of the intentions of the film was to make mopney, not solely be a homily as to what should be.Other examples could include Mrs. Cleaver walking around her kitchen 20 years later with high heels, seamed stockings and pearls, making breakfast for Wally and Beaver; Alan Ladd and Sydney duking it out on The Defiant Ones; while kisses were just a brush of the lips and couples sleeping in separate beds.This is a great movie. It can't touch those areas that were then impermissable. We don't dump Hemingway, Chandler and O'Hara in the 'racist-anti semetic' pot. We say they wrote as the times dictated. And 50 years from now, who knows?The picture roles through a remarkable, wrenching story that at the time, was only a generation and a half old.The women are beautiful. The men are noble and silly.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A25YSQIY1R0YG8	Laura Keating	"Now, I love both this movie and this book.  I would recommend it to everyone not only because I think that most people would like it, but also because it's a classic that I think everyone should see at least once.However, my opinion matters little (except to me!), although many share it.  It received 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture over The Wizard of Oz.  Both critics and viewers have heralded it as a classic for over 60 years.  For those cynics who believe that it may have been a masterpiece for it's time, but is now unimpressive, it was recently ranked the second best film of all time by the American Film Institute, second only to Citizen Kane.  It has continued to impress, inspire, and touch people all over.  It is regarded as a classic, one of the best films ever made-and by many, the best.I also have rebuttals to a few of the attacks thrown at the movie.  People have been complaining about the length of it, saying that 5 hours is too long to sit through a movie.  Well, while I would be willing to sit through 5 hours of a movie that is able to stay interesting for the full length of the movie, Gone with the Wind does not run 5 hours.  It runs 3:53 and each minute is important.  Also, people have been complaining that it is not shown in widescreen, but the fact of the matter is that wide screen wasn't even introduced until 1952, and wasn't widely used until even after that.  The reason they started to release movies in widescreen is because the new invention, the television, was taking business away from the movie industry, so to fight back, they made the movie screen larger than ever, giving people a reason to get out of their houses and back into the movie theatres.  One thing I do agree with is that there could be more extras on the DVD.  Of course this was one of the earlier DVDs released, before they started getting really generous with the extras, but I do wish they would release a new version with interesting extras.Of course not everyone is going to like this movie.  Is it historically accurate?  I couldn't really answer that question, but I do believe that on the whole it is.  Does it require some willing suspension of disbelief?  Certainly.  While there is a lot to say for movies that are accurate down to the tiniest detail, there is more to a movie than that.  It is the heart and soul that touches people.  And those who watch movies only to scrutinize and look for mistakes are missing the point.  When watching a movie-- any movie, it is necessary to let yourself be swept up in what is happening.  This is not a documentary, nor does it claim to be an authority on life during and after the civil war.  It is a fictional story with fictional characters and events that happens to use the tumultuous time of the civil war as a vehicle for an interesting plot.  I can't speak for Margaret Mitchell, but I believe that she did not write the story in this time because she wanted to do a thorough history of the south during the war.  I believe she used this particular time and place because before the war started, Tara was a perfect place-the perfect foil to the destruction that the war brought on.  To quote (or paraphrase if I don't get it absolutely right) Ashley Wilkes, ""Most of the miseries of the world were caused by war.""  Also, Tara before the war represented everything about Scarlet O'Hara's life growing up.  She was, quite frankly, a spoiled brat who grew up never knowing what it was to go without anything.  Why would we sit through almost 4 hours of watching a character like this?  To see her courage and strength tested over and over again, with her overcoming every obstacle in sight.  She may not be the most likeable of characters, but she sure is one of the strongest and most resilient ever to grace the screen, and that is something we can admire.  Of course, Scarlet is not the only reason to watch this film.  In fact, people would probably argue that her character is the worst part of the film (although I would disagree).  This movie is about the people of an era.  About who can survive hardships and why.  Other characters, such as Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley (who people often critique as being one-dimensional-and again, I would disagree), Ellen O'Hara (Scarlet's mother), or Gerald O'Hara (Scarlet's father), the servants, or countless other less appreciated but noble characters such as Ashley's father that remain in the background of the film, make it worth watching.  Plus, to see how much the world changed just in one generation humbles me.  Not only that, but I would recommend the movie to anyone if just to see the beautiful costumes and scenery!Whatever the reason, this is a movie one should see.  Some people just won't like it and, while I disagree with them, they are not wrong unless they say that the movie sucks or was poorly made.  There are just too many sources that disagree with that.  Speaking as an 18-year-old girl (who has loved the movie for at least 8 or 9 years), I believe that my generation has become so accustomed to bad teenage movies that only have enough content to fill an hour and a half that many people's attention spans are just long enough to accommodate that, and they can no longer appreciated a long movie with so much to say.  That is not to say that a movie has to be long to be good, but it just so happens that this, along with many, has 4 hours worth of action, wisdom, and entertainment.  Watch this movie and allow yourself to learn something."	5.0	Time to defend a classic	2001-12-29	17	14	3
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2RNEEQ1J8HT6L	Laura    LMacMonagl@aol.com	I think this movie was just wonderful.  It was made to display life back then so yes there is racism and sexism but that is just part of history.  I think this is either a movie you love or hate but most people obviously do  love it.  I thought it stuck with the book very closely and would have  loved to see all the parts in the book in the movie but then you get the  people that think the longer the movie the worse it is so the shortness in  understandably forgiven.

It's believable characters and  human emotions make this movie one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.This movie follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara as she lives the Civil War, and the effects of it. When the movie begins, Scarlett is a very flirtatious socialite with many beaus. She thinks she loves Ashley Wilkes, but in the end, she figures out that she tricked herself into thinking that. But Ashley is engaged to Melanie, the sweet cousin of him, so out of jealousy She marries Charles Hamilton, who dies at war.She then goes to Atlanta to live with busybody, Aunt Pittypat, who seems to faint every five seconds. She is very funny to watch. When the ""Yankees"" come to Atlanta, Melanie goes in to labor.I will let you see the movie to see what happens next. It is truly a classic movie.

Selznick are interesting to browse through and give a ""fly on the wall"" feeling.  The reproduced theater lobby booklet, that original moviegoers would have bought for .25 back then, is another gorgeous item, that I actually enjoyed looking through more than the photo book, because it contains lovely watercolor illustrations.  Speaking of watercolor paintings, the included postcard sized paintings are fantastic and printed on artist canvas type paper.

I wonder what kind of reception GWTW would have gotten had it come out in 1945 and been about a love affair between a man and woman in Nazi Germany.  Imagine Rhett Butler as the dashing U-boat captain who constantly evades those pesky British destroyers in the North Atlantic.  Picture Scarlett O'hara as the totally self-absorbed Fraulein who can't quite figure out what is in all those trains leaving town for central Europe because she is too busy thinking about a party dress. Despite the cinematic qualities of the film - which are undeniable - I cannot get past the fact that it romanticizes a society based on an evil institution.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AVZWSIELUAFXF	"Leigh A. Mills ""leighuf"""	GWTW is the epitome of the film world. It encompasses legendary actors and actresses, a timeless historical rendition of Civil War times, lavish sets, extraordinary costumes, and it is based on a best-seller novel. The hunt for an actress to play Scarlett captured world-wide attention and it finally went to the most perfect woman-- Vivien Leigh. Overall, the film is a masterpiece that will never be topped. Many have suggested that Titanic is comparable . . . but even that falls short.Many of criticized GWTW for being one-sided and racist. However, many of those who say this fail to realize that this film was released in 1939. On a whole, racism and discrimination were still rampant in those days. I firmly believe, though, that the film stays away from unnecessary words or insinuations. True, the film does stay true to the novel and depicts slavery as more as a friendly insitutition. In many cases, slavery was not friendly, but rather a punishing and horrific thing bestowed onto Africans. GWTW merely depicts those few who did feel familial to their owners.Though this film does span over many hours, it is intriguing and involving. I have watched this film numerous of times, in and out of the theater. Everytime I watch it, I cry and I laugh. GWTW's characters are legendary and they stay with you for longer than the film lasts. I HIGHLY recommend this film.	5.0	Simply a Classic!	2001-10-13	8	7	1

I'd love for there to be a few more battle scenes, and perhaps a little less emphasis on the whiny Scarlett, but on the whole, it's alright.What I can't understand was the filmmakers' insistence on turning a nice period piece into an exploitation movie.  I'm talking, of course, about the swearing by Clark Gable near the movie's end.  Why?  What was the point?  Were the film's producers so dead set on pushing the envelope that they felt they had to degrade the movie in such a way?  Imagine the Munchkins or Glenda from ""The Wizard of Oz"" saying such a thing.  It's unimaginable.I'm aware that new movies have much more foul language than this, but that still doesn't make this any better.

It is an unforgettable movie, and one which will never fade as  an all time favourite.  And anyone who calls themselves a movie buff, or  someone who just wants to lose themselves in another world for some 4  hours, cannot go by this as great entertainment.	5.0	Is there any better entertainment?	1999-08-12	4	1	3

Scarlet was not one of my favorite character when I first saw the movie but after awhile you realize that she had a tremendous impact.

Their is also a love story between the headstrong Scarlett O'Hara and the dashing Rhett Butler, played to the hilts by Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable.  Before movies were computerized, there is an excellent scene of the burning of Atlanta during the Civil War.  This movie has history, love, and it shows the strength that people can have during war time.  And our heroine Scarlett is probably the forerunner for Women's Lib, which is depicted through her strength in the face of adversary.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1Z73MNMFZ4MZ3	"Little Miss Media ""Miss Media"""	Acknowledgements of the African American actors were ignored in the re-packaged version of GWTW.I am especially disgusted that Hattie McDaniel was not given a biography page(or 2 actually) as were given to the other stars. This is considering the fact that GWTW is considered a national treasure and that she is more 'American' than Vivien Leigh and some of the other stars.Both her parents were slaves, and by virtue of this fact, they directly contributed to the South's wealth. In addition, her father, Henry McDaniel served in Tennessee's Twelfth United States Colored Infantry, which mean he fought for the South! In fact, after the war, he was crippled for life.The 70th anniversary team had a chance to re-write history but they instead chose to ignore including her biography, and thus, her and her family's contributions to the South. They had a chance to teach America's increasingly diverse population that its history was multi faceted but they chose not to.I find that this racist omission/re-writing of history is similar to the assertion by Ashley Wilkes (in the scene where he is opposing Scarlett's use of prison workers for their company) in the film that slaves were not treated badly. Ha! Such a joke.I hope that subsequent editions take this history into account, because if not the actions presented as historical truth will always leave a bitter taste when I hear of GWTW.	4.0	The Omission of Hattie McDaniel's bio	2009-12-02	19	4	15

From the best selling book came the movie.Gone with the Wind took the Oscars by storm with more than eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  It starred Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler.  Vivien Leigh and Hattie McDaniel were the 1939 Oscar winners for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively.  It was also voted #4 on the American Film Institute's 100 Best Motion Pictures of All Time.The masculine Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) attempted to win the heart of the untamable Scarlett O'Hara. (Vivian Leigh)  Scarlett a courageous Southern belle longed for the man of her dreams, Ashley Wilkes. (Leslie Howard)  Ashley married the kind and loving lady Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland).During this dramatic film, Scarlett endures hardships, war, death and loss.  When Tara, her plantation home is threatened, she portrays a heroic part.  She will do anything to protect her family plantation home.This romantic film has an unforgettable sound track.  The burning of Atlanta is an unforgettable sight, with the flames deep in red, orange and yellow colors.  And you can't forget the famous phrase ""But, Rhett, what shall I do?  Where shall I go?"" and Rhett replies, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.""I give Gone with the Wind five stars.  This movie is about hope, love and hardships.

From the first seen with the three white women in a cotton field on the plantation called Tara in Georgia during the Civil War to the end when Scarlett played by Vivian Leigh decides to return too the plantation I cannot come up enough words to describe this epic.Vivien Leigh's performance as a spoiled, self-centered lady name Scarlett was awesome.Scarlett was very man hungry.  She would do whatever to get money to save the Tara from being taken from them for taxes by the Carpetbagger. And Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, who is gentleman and is so in love with Scarlett that he sticks by her as long as he can even though he knows she is not in love with him. In the end Rhett is the only man who is Scarletts' match and she realizes she loves him when it is too late. Rhett leaves her because he realizes the she will never love him and they have lost their only child so there is nothing for him to stay for. He wants to go back to Charleston where he came from too see if he can find peace, charm and grace.  I loved it when he walked out the door to leave Scarlett and she ask him what am I going to do and Rhett stated ""Frankly I do not give a damn.""  Then you have Leslie Howard as Ashley who is weak and timid but Scarlett is deeply in love with and would do anything to have him.  And Hattie McDaniel, the first African- American to win an Academy Award plays as ""Mamie"" who is Scarlett's maid, loves them dearly and seems to be the only one who plays the mother role to Bonnie (Scarlett daughter) and shows so much love for the family. Hattie's tells Rhett that he should not put Bonnie on the horse with a dress on. She states, "" It ain't fitten, just ain't fitten!This movie I feel appeals to all audiences both male and female.

The performances and characterizations are far better than any reenactment I've ever seen, or for that matter, anything recorded by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Everyone involved is at the top of their game, from the art directors (wow, imagine having to handpaint all those reels of footage) to the first black Oscar winner, Hattie McDaniel (eat your heart out, Holly Berry!).If this set has a flaw, it's the lack of extras. I mean, no director audio track? At least Gable or Leigh or Olivia de Havilland could've sat down and chatted a bit with Leonard Maltin or some equally respected Hollywood historian. Are their schedules too busy for that? I'm sorry, French subtitles, as much I enjoy them, just aren't enough. [EDIT: Oops - talk about timeless.

This edition which is THE TWO DISC 70th ANNIVERSARY EDITION comes with a commentary by Historian Rudy Behlmer. That is the only special feature on the disc. You will have to buy the four disc edition for other material. This movie is a Digital Transfer capturing a HIGHER RESOLUTION from the RESTORED PICTURE.

I could have paid extra for the 4 Disc Edition but this edition is great and captures that vivid Technicolor image.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A7VN5EQQS69WS	Luke	Gone With the Wind, simply put, is my favorite movie I have ever seen. From the first scene with Scarlett, absolutely brilliantly played by Vivien Leigh, on the porch of her magnificent plantation Tara, to the final moment  in the film when she decides to go home, followed by her return to the  plantation, I am filled by a feeling that I am scarcely able to describe.First of all, the performances are almost all, without a doubt, perhaps  the most wonderful of all time. It's as though all the great talent of  Hollywood in the 1930's was ensembled together and put in this incredible  film. Vivien Leigh, (an Englishwoman mind you) portrays to perfection the  role of the narcissistic, spoiled, and self-centered Scarlett O'Hara. Clark  Gable was perfectly cast as the gentlemanly, yet quasi-ignoble Rhett  Butler, as Amazon says one of the most &quot;manly&quot; performances ever.  Olivia de Havilland shines as the naive, and sometimes overly-trusting  &quot;good-doer&quot;, who sees beyond (sometimes when she shouldn't)  Scarlett's self-concerned personality. Leslie Howard as the timid and weak  Ashley, just another excellent performance. And Hattie McDaniel, who playes  Scarlett's &quot;Mamie&quot;, also an incredible actress, also the first  African-American to win an Academy Award.The movie is an incredible  achievement in every other area too: from a brilliantly written script  (written by many screenwriters) filled with memorable lines that are  constantly quoted, such as &quot;I'll think about that tomorrow&quot;,  &quot;Fiddle-dee-dee&quot; and others; to a beautiful film with some of the  best cinematography I've seen to date. The story itself is compelling, and  it is relevant to every aspect of modern day life, even though takes place  in a time period &quot;which you will only read about in books&quot;.By  the way, if you're a guy reading this and you're concerned that this is too  much of a &quot;chick flick&quot;, as I've known many fellow men to say,  just think about the movie's universal themes, the determination, the sense  of pride, the horrible effects of racism, the feelings of love for home,  etc. If Gone With the Wind is a &quot;chick flick&quot;, then The Maltese  Falcon and The Big Sleep are &quot;guy movies&quot;.In sum, I can  honestly say that my life has been changed by repeated viewings of this  great piece of cinematic art.	5.0	If I Could Only See One Movie Ever Again, This Would Be It	2000-04-07	10	9	1

It could be called the greatest film, it could be called the most beloved film, and it certainly can be called the greatest love story of the 20 Century.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A25KKXUQQ0OLWB	"Lynn Ellingwood ""The ESOL Teacher"""	Gone With The Wind is the greatest film ever made and this is a worthy edition.  The film looks better than ever before and is perfectly restored.  It was just amazing and I'd grown tired of how many times people had claimed that the negative had been fully restored.  You can see more of the picture than was ever possible before.  The Olivia de Haviland interview is quite entertaining.  She is quite spry for a 90 year old.  The documetary on Gone With The Wind, as well as the documentaries on Clark Gable and Viven Leigh are quite entertaining and interesting to watch.  The snippets on stars in smaller roles are quite interesting too.  The only thing I saw that lessened the DVD package was the film commentary.  Mr. Belmer becomes boring and I wish that someone else besides a film historian could have made the commentary.  Of course, few are living now and had the experience of seeing the filming first hand.  Still, I recommend the DVD 4-disk set and that people make an effort to watch it all at least once - the movie, you will want to see over and over again.  The documentary on how the film was restored was great too and was great incentive to purchase the Singin' In the Rain and The Adventures of Robin Hood DVDs too.	5.0	Outstanding!	2007-02-09	2	2	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A4SY5RCGC5CH9	"Maciej ""Darth Maciek"""	"As a man I am probably not the most typical fan of this movie, which is very feminine, and sometimes surprisingly feminist. And still I can not help it. I always loved GWTW and it still has on me a magical effect, as few others manage to do (the others being essentially ""Star Wars"", ""The longest day"", ""The seven samurai"" and ""Alien""). This is an adaptation of a very long (and excellent) book, so it has to be long. And it is. And me for one I am very happy that it is, because there is no way to tell the whole story shorter. Period.GWTW is two stories in one and they are both passionate - and very, very sad. The background is about the death of a country, a civilisation and a way of life. And no matter what is your opinion on the American South, a death is never happy - but it can be a great story. And it is. The scene with Scarlett walking between the wounded Confederate soldiers in the railway station of Atlanta is unbelievable - those who never saw it, missed something great and perfect.The second story is about the coming of age and maturing of a very beautiful but rather stupid and mean young girl. Scarlett is 17 at the beginning of the movie - immature, lazy, silly and spoiled she is in fact a horrible (although cute) little brat. The cataclysm swallowing her world will force her to change and she will show a surprising strength - you simply must admire her for the moment when she succesfully deals with the repugnant Yankee plunderer, who came to steal the very last money and the very last food of four starving and sick women. The scene in which, on the ruins of the world, in the background of blood coloured sunset, she swears that she will never be hungry again, is one of the most powerful ever in the history of cinema.Now, being initially just a silly, spoiled child, Scarlett couldn't help but fall for the wrong guy, handsome and intelligent but weak Ashley Wilkes - when in the same time becoming the object of interest of possibly the most incredibly appealing macho in world history, Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, in his greatest role ever.Then, there is Melanie, Ashley's wife, played by Olivia de Havilland. You have to read the book to see how incredibly strong and smart is Melanie. She in fact is the real ""Power woman"" in the movie - although her iron rule is made with the softest of gloves. I always was in deep awe of this character and of the way Olivia De Havilland played her.Relations and tragedies between those four are one of the greatest stories ever told on the screen. Of course, like all the great stories, and mostly like life itself, this is one is devoided of happy ending... although? The last scene of the movie is just incredible... there is so much you can see in it and how you see this scene, well, it depends of your heart. This is a mythical movie, played by great actors, with an incredibly powerful and moving musical score and with costumes and decors which still can impress, even today. I strongly believe, that who never stood with Scarlett under this dead tree, looking at this bloody sunset, holding this pathetic radish she digged barehanded from the dirt and screaming to God that she will never, never be hungry again... he missed something important that should not be missed."	5.0	One of the greatest movies ever - a masterpiece which will never age	2012-02-09	5	4	1
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3DKM6E4Q3WI68	"MadameX ""scribe3"""	This movie stays with you forever because it has unforgettable characters. Scarlett and Rhett, the main characters are strong, dynamic engrossing personalities. Many other unforgettables include Mammy, Aunt Pitty, Melanie, and of course Prissy. These characters come together magnificently to form the greatest movie of all time. This story is about the Ole South and its downfall and reconstruction and how it changed the lives of the people involved. It's inspirational because Scarlett shows much courage in dealing with adversities and is determined to rise above hardships no matter what the cost. It's also a great love story between Scarlett and Rhett who are like souls made for each other. Rhett knows this immediately but Scarlett doesn't catch on until much later.  There's a lot of excitement and energy in this movie and it draws you in emotionally and never lets go. It's courageous, humorous, tragic and sometimes all of these things at once. The casting of Clark Gable as Rhett and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett is perfect and could never be improved. This movie was made in 1939 and is still shining brightly for new generations.	5.0	Spectacular and Unforgettable	2002-04-20	8	6	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3C9SB007FKMUO	Maggie Conner	"""Gone with the Wind"" has been one of my favorite movies since I was a little girl.  The glory of the old south filled with hoop skirts, balls and barbecues.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has a passion for a story filled with love, triumphant and defeat.  While I adore this movie, it is important to point out that I on no way condone the idea that it is an accurate portrayal of the ""old south"".  The institution of slavery was a prominent factor in southern lives.  Gone With the Wind depicts white masters and slaves having kind and loving relationships, there was rarely any violence shown towards the slaves.  I personally feel one cannot discuss slavery without discussing violence.  Slaves lived were filled with brutality and violence on a day to day basis, there is no getting around this.  Another reviewer named leighuf discusses the idea that Gone With the Wind is seen as ""one sided and racist"".  She herself agrees that slavery is more violent than it is portrayed in the movie but she indicates this film is merely showing that there were a few kind slave owners.  I feel if people because the issue of violence was not shown with slavery, one cannot look at this film in a historically accurate way.  The south, historically speaking, was not just barbecues and hoop skirts, it was a land of violence and brutality of a group of people based merely on the color of their skin.  In Mechal Sobel's book ""The World They Made Together"", a historical look at the interaction of black and white cultures in America, she also portrays slavery without violence.  Like the film, I greatly enjoyed her book yet could not find it to be a true portrayal of slavery because it also failed to mention the issue of violence.  ""Gone With the Wind"" is an excellent movie.  The acting, cinematography and script are fabulous and it is truly a pleasure to watch.  But one should understand before viewing that this is not an accurate portrayal of the South.  While I watch the film for enjoyment, I never mistake the depiction of the South in the movie for the real thing.  One must remember while it is fun to watch, slavery and violence were very real in the ""old south""."	5.0	The good and bad of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;	2001-11-19	4	0	4

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AWZTPHA81PZDG	MalachiX	Gone With the Wind is remember as a great movie because of it's epic scope and excellent production values.  But 60 years later when the big budget no longer thrills us, we are left with a decent film but nothing special.To begin with the entire film is very campy and melodramatic.  The whole film is very heavy-handed and over-done.  Scenes like where Scarlet crys &quot;I'll never be hungry again&quot; are just plain ackward.  Someone should have tatooed the word &quot;subtlty&quot; on Selznick's head.The script is fairly weak too.  It presents a very narrow, one dimensional view of the Civil War.  Worse, the Civil War ends half way through the movie and the rest of the film lacks the first half's energy.Another major flaw is that the characters lack any real depth.  Scarlet is cold and nasty through the whole movie.  She never changes untill the last two minutes of the movie.  There is simply no development.  Ashley is noble and his wife is so nice and sweat that it makes me sick.  These characters simply aren't human and don't feal real.  Probably the only character in the whole movie who actually developes at all is Ret.  Sadly, Clark Gable's strong performance isn't enough to carry the rest of the cast.It should also be noted that Gone With the Wind is very racist at some points.  The scene where all the slaves are going off to fight the &quot;evil yankees&quot; is enough to turns one's stomache.  Most of the black characters are portrayed as child-like and stupid.  The only exception to this is Mimi who does an excellent job and deserved her Oscar.Gone With the Wind is still an example of fine production values but when you strip away all the lavish sets and money spent on the film, you're left with a rather hollow experiance.  While there is no denying that it is a very pretty movie, even today, and it does have it's moments, Gone With the Wind is simply an over-done and campy movie.  This film does not deserve to be ranked up there with the likes of Citizen Kane or the Godfather.  It's just not that good.	3.0	One of the Most Overrated Films Ever	2001-05-22	26	9	17
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3HN2154Z4KYHL	Malcolm Campbell	"No one can deny that this film deserves its reputation.  As a movie, it's flawless - read any of the other reviews for justification.  However, I find it hard to accept its glorification and romanticization of white supremacy - the ""good old south.""  It's also disturbing that the racist undertones are widely ignored.  Perhaps this is immaterial to the viewers who look only for a perfectly acted, timeless romance.  If so, by all means buy this, but watch it for what it is."	3.0	Timeless acting and directing, disturbing undertones.	2004-12-17	14	3	11
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A25FWMBX1ZWLWN	"Malik Grady ""brother_gator"""	Especially after having recently seen Django Unchained, every moment of Gone with the Wind is even more fraught with uneasiness at the unspoken, unseen or cringe-worthy depiction of slavery and black people in general. However, the performances by Olivia de Havilland as Melanie and Hattie McDaniel as Mammy (God, it hurts even to type that name, it's so awful) are standouts even today.The twisted glee that I get from literally fantasizing about strangling Butterfly McQueen in her performance as Prissy is delicious, and there are countless quotable moments throughout the film.Perhaps my favorite, from Clark Gable as Rhett Butler:&#34;No, I don't think I will kiss you. ... Although you need kissing, badly. That's what's wrong with you. You should be kissed, and often... and by someone who knows how!&#34;What a baller line. Damn.	5.0	Yes, I'm black.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1GVO1TOSH51N9	"Mandy ""StarWarsLover"""	This is probably the most meormable movie of the 20th Cenutry and has the most popular love story ever brought to screen : the love between Scarlett O' Hara and Rhett Butler. The movie is about a southern belle named Scarlett O' Hara ( played by a beautiful Viven Leigh )  who deals with the Civil War and how it effects her. It takes place over a 12 year period, and during this time we see Scarlett's achievements and dissappiontments in her life. But still throughout her life, she still remains that determined, boundless engery, bold young woman she always was. There are also some great supporting characters : Rhett Butler ( played by Clark Gable ), Melanie Wilkes ( Olivia De Havilland ), Ashley Wilkes ( Leslie Horward ), and the sassy Mammy ( Hattie McDaniel ). With a meormable ending, this movie is classic and will always be remembered for being one of the silver screen's biggest achivement.The DVD quality is great, the picture comes out crystal clear. The sound quality is good, you could hear EVERYTHING. I highly recommend this movie.	5.0	Gone With the Wind	2004-11-13	0	0	0
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1IANEBSMVGHS9	"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny"""	"For four hours, ""Gone with the Wind"" takes you on a pseudo-historical journey through the life in Georgia at the time of the Civil, war, while spicing it up with some humurous segments and romantic scenes. Sounds like a cliched story? Not even close! Begin by considering the date the movie came out: 1939, and you realize that most of the elements in the movie were probably decades ahead of its time. The two main characters (played by Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable) were definitely groundbraking: she, with her selfishness that turns her into a person without scruples who is willing to marry men out of interest, with no regard or respect for other people's feelings; Gable, on the other hand, a womanizer who doesn't ""give a damn"" (the last line he delivers in the movie is simply brilliant and timeless!), he doesn't participate in the war until a bit of conscience comes up and bites him, but inside, he is a good man.Now, on to the technical aspects of the movie: they're also well ahead of their time. Cinematography: simply amazing. At the time Technicolor was just fresh out of the oven and this movie sure exploits it well: some of the shots of silhouettes against the red sunsets or a carriage against a falling burning building are breathtaking. In terms of effects (if you want to call them like that,) the explosions, fires and even more, a shot of a huge area covered with war victims (both, dead and alive) which is zoomed out on, as a Scarlett (Leigh) starts to walk through it, is a lesson for contemporary ""digital"" directors, such as George Lucas, whose two most recent Episodes are packed with blue screens and artificial components. The music (that tune you've heard once and again in the Oscars and elsewhere...) I mean, there's not a single element in the movie that you'd regret or consider timed. These will be the best four hours watching a movie you are likely to spend in quite a while."	5.0	Ahead of its time in all aspects!	2002-03-17	10	7	3

I agree 100% with the complaint of other reviewers that TNT's exceptional ""Making Gone With The Wind"" documentary was not included on the DVD as a special feature as well the equally fantastic TNT biographies about Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. It is quite possible that just like they did with films such as Casabanca and Yankee Doodle Dandy, Warner Brothers will re-issue GWTW on DVD as a two disc special edition; perhaps next year to coincide with the 65th anniversary of the film's theatrical release.

"GONE WITH THE WIND indeed WAS shown in Widescreen- Im not certain of the ratio, but I read this-I dont remember where now, but from a creditable source to my thinking, at the time-This was because by the mid-1950s,  Hollywood went through a Widescreen/Cinemascope craze, so they hauled out GWTW, trimmed it to make it in the WS ratio, and BAM!-here was a good excuse to re-release this blockbuster in the then-new format-and rake in a ton more money!-minus the top and bottom areas of the film.I dont recall the critical reaction then, but I do know that it is now looked at as an embarrassing episode in the history of MGM, better left untalked about and forgotten...I think MGM may have tried the same thing to WIZARD OF OZ-BOTH of the films were 4:3-TV square sized-as noted, save a couple exceptions, Widescreen didnt catch on until the early-mid 1950s, though I do know of 2 films shot WS before 1940-Able Ganzs' NAPOLEON, and a western, which I think John Wayne was in.Im sure all copies of the evidence are now destoyed, and anyone who knew about it was ""dissappeared"" at the bottom of a lake somewhere...  ;-)"	4.0	No, you were not imagining...	2006-06-17	6	1	5

The new interview with 88-year-old Olivia deHavilland is especially enjoyable.Only one quibble:  Why not include ALL of the original test footage for us to see?  The excerpts that are seen in the making-of documentary are great, but I would like to see all of Vivien Leigh's famous test of the paddock scene as well as the tests of all the actors (most of them famous stars) who tried for Scarlett, Ashley and other roles.That aside, this set gets a 6 on a 5 star rating scale.	5.0	WOW!	2004-11-19	12	9	3
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AFLQGO7CJVK50	"Mark J. House ""Mark J House"""	THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE REGARDLESS OF CATEGORY. Although drama and romance, not my favorite categories, are this movies strong points, I love this movie. People can say all they want to about Titanic, Batman, Avatar, WHATEVER. Gone With The Wind is the best movie ever made, period. Vivien Leigh is one of the sexiest women, even though long dead by now, I have ever seen and not afraid to flaunt it with her wardrobe on this movie(although there is no nudity, for back then, her outfits are pretty provocative). The sets, backgrounds, and especially the authentic clothing of that era is unbelievably good and accurate! THE best movie EVER. Higher than the Highest recommendation possible!!!

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A30TW9R3R0NODW	Mark Kittell	"Any discussion of the merits of GWTW is redundant, but in regard to this new collector's edition DVD, it's a must-own if disappointing to a certain degree.The video transfer is excellent, the audio is efficient if not totally satisfactory, and thankfully Warner placed the film on two single-sided disks and not the annoying double-sided disks that Ben-Hur and Doctor Zhivago (and the original DVD release of GWTW) were subjected to.The special features, however, are more problematic. The biggest disappointment is film historian Rudy Behlmer's audio commentary. Although not outright dull, Behlmer's does little to illuminate what one is watching, especially in the second half of the film. All too often during key scenes--such as the late-night confrontation between Scarlett and a drunken Rhett--when we want insight into expectations, intentions and conflicts, too often what we get is Behlmer droning on about relatively trivial matters that have little to do with the film. Nor does he discuss the political and social incongruities of the film, such as the stereotypical Southern view of Reconstruction. One might say that in a film of this length there is a premium on useful information, but Michael Jeck's excellent commentary on Criterion's Seven Samurai DVD blows that theory out of the water.Fortunately the ""Making of a Legend"" documentary fills in a few of the large holes left gaping in the commentary, although it isn't as dramatic or continuously fascinating as, say, the making of documentary on the Taylor-Burton opus Cleopatra DVD. On ""Melanie Remembers"" Olivia de Havilland is charming, while the Clark Gable documentary, made in the mid-70's, at least had the benefit of a host (Peter Lawford) who gave the proceedings a modicum of dignity without saccharin-laced fawning admiration. The Vivien Leigh documentary, on the other hand, suffers from the giddy narration of Jessica Lange. Leigh, for all her apparent success, was also a tragic, flawed figure beneath the image of screen royalty. Her manic-depression, which manifested itself much earlier than the documentary suggests, and her increasing isolation from husband Lawrence Olivier's artistic ambitions is not given sufficient attention (or sufficient seriousness) in regard to its effect not only on her career but how even close friends had much to endure.However, aside from these quibbles, the fact that Warner did get around to improving on the previous DVD release requires that the film buff own it, although those with only a casual interest might rightly balk at the $39.99 price tag for this edition when the film can still be had on DVD for $14.99."	4.0	almost, but not quite	2004-11-15	18	15	3

The little-known gem in this four-disc collection is the equally worthy Making of A Legend, Ted Turner's 1989 50th-anniversary documentary, which sets the standard for all movie documentaries. It's the result of such exhaustive research and loving recreation, you may never watch another of the hastily assembled ""talking heads"" features that become just so much filler on lesser DVD packages. I love just one thing more than movies, movies about movies.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AAYE34TCTNV2R	MarlowesMom	"This review is from the double-sided one-disc package, not the 70th anniversary two-disc package, which I have not seen. Apparently little restoration had been done for this edition. Frequently the colors looked faded, the images looked blurred, and the soundtrack was inaudible, even allowing for the fact that most of the actors were talking pretty fast as they raced through a long, long story.Back in 1939 when Gone with the Wind came out, the TV mini-series did not exist (of course not, as TV was still very much experimental), and the idea of making a multi-part film out of a long best-selling novel must not have been something the studios would have considered. As a result, even at almost 4 hours of screen time, you end up with a sort of Reader's Digest Condensed/Greatest Hits version of Margaret Mitchell's novel. Since I read the book before I saw the movie, I can't objectively say how coherent the film would appear to someone who did not already know the story--but I suspect it could be somewhat confusing.On the positive side:I can't imagine better casting of the two leads. Vivien Leigh is perhaps a little too lovely as protagonist Scarlett O'Hara (described in Mitchell's novel as ""not beautiful, but men seldom noticed when caught by her charm""), but she otherwise nails the character's appearance and spirit with her black hair, spellbinding green eyes, pale skin and sparkling vivacious energy. I hadn't seen a Clark Gable movie in years and I'd forgotten what an utter movie star he is. Mitchell could practically have written her Rhett Butler character with him in mind, with his swarthy good looks, intelligence, humor, cynicism and vulnerability.  Gable's even the right age for the character, who is supposed to be 17 years older than Scarlett. Most of the supporting cast is stellar, with Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen unforgettable in their stereotyped roles of the slaves Mammy and Prissy.Although it's a studio back lot production--nobody was about to go film on location in northern Georgia back then--the producers, directors (several worked on the film in addition to the credited Victor Fleming) and other technical people did an outstanding job with the settings, costumes, action and special effects. I had no trouble at all feeling like I was in Georgia during and after the Civil War. The siege and burning of Atlanta are very impressive, especially considering how limited special effects technology was back in those days.On the less positive side:Because they're trying to cover so much material, every scene races along at breakneck speed. That's probably better than being too boring, but it would be nice if once in a while, they slowed down a little bit. Even a deathbed scene and the big denouement feel rushed. It's a bit wearying, like a concert where the band only plays really fast songs instead of mixing in some ballads and mid-tempo numbers.Leslie Howard is miscast as Ashley Wilkes, the man with whom Scarlett is obsessed. In his mid-40s, he's simply too old and jaded to play the golden young knight of Clayton County. If the audience can't at least get a sense of what Scarlett sees in him, deluded though she may have been, it throws the story off balance. Olivia de Havilland captures Melanie's combination of gentility and strength well but is far too healthy-looking. Instead of looking frail and ""as narrow-hipped as a young boy,"" de Havilland looks like she could have 10 children without batting an eye.Other than Vivien Leigh and the African-American actors, nobody even tries to speak with a southern accent, marring the filmmaker's efforts to create an authentic atmosphere. From what I've read, actors seldom attempted accent work when this movie was made.Like the source material, the films paints an overly romantic picture of the antebellum south, though some of the worst offenses of Mitchell's novel are toned down. The Ku Klux Klan is not mentioned by name, and the most racist language is revised or omitted.It's sort of fun to think about how one would re-film the story in a different format that would allow the story to proceed at a more leisurely pace so more of the book's richness of incident and characterization could come out, but it's hard to think who you could cast as Rhett and Scarlett--Leigh and Gable are just so darned perfect for their roles. GWTW was quite a feat of film-making in its day, winning all the major awards, and it's still interesting to watch today."	3.0	Four Stars for the Movie, 1 Star for the DVD	2011-06-28	2	1	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3O2RCKAMSE9X7	Martin Asiner	GONE WITH THE WIND is the movie epic by which all other movies are judged.  During its nearly four hours, the audience can see several movies in one: a love story, a war epic, a portrait of a self-driven woman to succeed regardless of cost, an historical saga, and the need of a displaced formerly proud people to regain their roots.  Much of the sweep of Margaret Mitchell's novel is retained while losing only extraneous material.  Director Victor Fleming presents a vision of the South that existed only for a precious, priviliged few.  The first half centers on this ante-bellum image of a julip drinking South peopled mostly with polished gentlemen and marriage-hunting women.  The dramatic focus of both halves is, of course, Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivien Leigh in the role of a lifetime.  Scarlett shows none of the monomania for success that drives her later on.  Here, she is vain, flirty, and totally self-centered, except for her obsession for Ashley Wilkes, who as played by Leslie Howard, comes off as the last of a dying breed of Southern gentlemen.  She throws herself at his feet, promising to love him eternally.  When he rejects her, she slaps his face, now promising to despise him.  As fine an actor as Leslie Howard is, he cannot set himself up as her power equal.  For that, Clark Gable enters as Rhett Butler, a man who sees the world as it is and people as they are.  In nearly the same scene, he announces to all the Southern gentlemen present that their beloved South has no chance to win the war. Moments later, he informs Scarlett that he will have her as surely as the South will lose the war.As the first half proceeds, the audience can see the proud South slowly crumble under the might of the industrial North.  This crumbling is measured in blighted landscapes and human lives lost.  One of the most powerful scenes in any movie is the one in which Scarlett leaves the Confederate hospital because she is too spent to care for the constant influx of dead and dying men.  As she emerges into the sunlight, the camera lingers on a few bodies lying in the street, then expands into a vast panorama of thousands more waiting helplessly for women like Scarlett to tend to them.  It is this vision of a dying way of life that propels the first half into Scarlett's return to Tara.Her metamorphosis from vain party girl to a driven monomania for money is punctuated by the impossibly dramatic silhouette of Scarlett ripping out shrubs and eating them raw, all the while shaking her fist at God promising Him that she will prevail.Following the intermission, the pace of the film slows and becomes less sweep and more soap opera. Events happen in a whirl.  Scarlett has one husband, then another, a child is born, a child dies, a husband leaves her.  The finale of Rhett storming out into the night with his now cliched 'Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn,' is the final lesson that Scarlett has to learn.  She has stepped on those whose only offense was to love her.  Ironically, as she gains the riches that she thought she wanted more than anything else, she now sees those riches as hollow as the magnificent but empty mansion in which she now lives quite alone.The amount of pity that the audience feels for Scarlett is a function of how they evaluate her justification for the pursuit of wealth.  Scarlett may be wounded at the end, but if the audience feels a lack of pity for her, then surely they also see a woman whose bravado has stood her in good stead often during past crises.  Her new solitary existence promises to be the most severe test yet of that bravado.	5.0	Gone With the Wind: The Epic Standard	2002-07-29	29	25	4

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3PV6OG23AV6Z3	Matt Coffman	GWTW is an incredible movie.  If you haven't seen it, you need to.  The storyline is incredible, the cinemtography is breathtaking, and Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable give some of the best performances of thier careers.  Yet GWTW should not be watched with any expectation of historical accuracy.  GWTW is a historical memory of the south that is extremely romantic and wonderfully sugar-coated.The Civil War plays a background part, as does most of history in this movie.  This is not to say that there is anything wrong with that, but no one should expect the movie to educate them with regard to US history.  GWTW also glazes over the institution of slavery, carefully portraying only those slaves that felt a familial bond with thier owners.  While this was sometimes the case, history tells us that more often than not, slaves did wish to be free and few stayed on with thier owners after the war was over.All in all, however, this was an excellent movie.  It was well worth the four hours, never really dragging.  Just don't use this moive as historical education about the south or the Civil War.	4.0	Gone With the Wind- A historical memory	2001-11-20	6	5	1
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3JZ5L52FM318H	"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen"""	"First of all, I think it's great that barebones editions like this exist, when studios seem terribly keen on special editions of single movies that charge 2 and 3 times what a reasonable price for a single film is.This disc is currently only available at Target stores, but is hitting wider release on 2/2/10. So check back then if you want to get this from Amazon. It probably would not pay to buy this from the ""other sellers"" right now, because most are charging near the price of the multi-disc edition.OK, onto the disc itself.The Film:I must be one of those people who somehow had avoided seeing this film. Well, this Blu-Ray was my first exposure to it. And all I can say is, yes, this certainly belongs in the top 5 American movies ever made. It truly is epic and sweeping, with heaping helpings of history, romance, melodrama, and beauty.Both of the primary actors are very good, and they have an interesting chemistry on screen. Vivien Leigh's performance is a tour de force in that she is able to keep us caring about her character despite the character's many shortcomings. The supporting cast is more than competent as well, although I will say I wish Ashley could have tamed his obvious British accent a bit more than he did. I was particularly impressed by the significant roles played by black actors - for 1939, no mean feat. Granted, they are almost all slaves, but many of the actors invest their characters with great depth and feeling.Also very impressive was the portrayal of the Civil War from the Confederate perspective. The suffering of the soldiers and the effects this has on the populace are very starkly portrayed.Many visual compositions are quite beautiful, especially sunsets, the blazing infernos of burning Atlanta, and the exquisite matte paintings of the manors and estates.This truly is one of those movies everyone should see before they die. It's an unforgettable experience. At 3 hours and 53 minutes (a tad less if you speed through the overture, intermission, and exit music), it's quite a chunk of film to get through in one sitting. But the story is so absorbing, you may just find yourself wanting to.The Blu-Ray:This film is presented in a 1080p, 1.33:1 aspect ratio encode. This is the proper aspect ratio for the film, and thank goodness no one attempted to create a faux-widescreen image.While shots that contain optical effects suffer a bit in detail (due to the double and triple passes on the film elements to layer the effects), most of the film is impressively detailed. It's not going to beat you over the head as ""high definition,"" but if you really look, you will see a lot of little things. The cloth of the costumes is particularly nice to look at. The early technicolor process is preserved well, with its slightly hazy but very lush color scheme. Reds and oranges in particular really pop off of the screen. Comparing this transfer with films of a similar vintage (e.g. Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz), it comes off very nicely.The audio is presented in both Dolby TrueHD and the original mono soundtrack. It is a tad quiet, and I watched this film at a level about 20% higher than most movies. It was, however, well balanced between dialogue, music, and effects, and the booming of cannon in the rear surrounds and subwoofer channels was quite impressive.I frequently check out the subtitles on home video, and wow, were these subtitles ever WAY off. I realize there is a lot of dialogue in this film, but literally 20 to 30 percent of it is lost in the transition to the subtitle track. I just don't get why studios do this, especially on a classic film like this. If I were a member of the deaf community, I'd be pretty peeved.Conclusion:Warner Bros. has really delivered the goods, with a respectful transfer of the film that both delivers on quality but also doesn't overdo things like Digital Noise Reduction and Edge Enhancement. This is a terrific Blu-Ray, and it's a classic film. And I don't mean classic in the way that some old films are a little boring or their writing doesn't stand up today, or it might not be appreciated by a modern audience. I mean, this is a CLASSIC, and anyone should be able to enjoy it mightily."	5.0	Good barebones Blu-Ray for those of us who don't want to pay for the fluff	2009-12-30	13	10	3

Taylor clearly states in his excellent review do not expect historical accuracy nor political-correctness from this film. More than 60 years has elapsed since it was filmed and IMHO it will be unfair to focus on those two items to evaluate it.The story is well known; still I'll sketch it for reviewing convenience.Scarlett O'Hara is a very young & mercurial wealthy southern heiress just at the start of Civil War. She is infatuated with his neighbor Ashley Wilkes.Rhett Butler is a mysterious gentleman from Charleston, skeptical about war.He eavesdrop Scarlett's desperate love declaration to Ashley and his rejection. He is somehow enticed by this passionate girl. He makes a gallant overture but he is turned down cold by angry Scarlett.War erupts disturbing everybody's life!Ashley marries his cousin Melanie and immediately departs to the front. Distressed Scarlett marries one of her suitors and soon become a young widow.In a few years South is starting to be defeated and Sherman's invading forces find Scarlett at Atlanta. Rhett rescue her from the burning city.As South sinks, so does Scarlett & company... nevertheless she will struggle with each menace, peril or foe with all her strength using whatever resource she has at hand.The movie is the chronicle of her deeds and its costs!Clark Gable performance's as Rhett Butler is really top-notch, deserving his Oscar nomination (and more).  With subtleness he composes a complex character: cynic yet chivalrous, tough yet kindhearted, detached yet madly in love with Scarlett.Vivien Leigh's Scarlett is a legendary performance. She portrays Scarlett from nearly adolescent until a grown up woman, from a scatterbrained damsel into a willful business woman. Her Oscar was more than well deserved.What to say about the ""secondary"" or ""supporting"" actresses & actors! Olivia de Havilland (nothing less), Oscar nominee; Hattie McDaniel, Oscar winner; Leslie Howard gives an excellent performance, even personifying lukewarm character; Butterfly McQueen as childish irresponsible Prissy; Ward Bond in a minor role; veteran Harry Davenport as Dr. Meade and so on.All technical items are exceptional!Ernest Haller's color picture is unbelievable beautiful. Atlanta burning images are just unforgettable.  Prolific Haller, more than 182 films, won his only Oscar with this film yet he will be nominated several times more.Musical score authored by multi-awarded Max Steiner underlines each scene & mood outstandingly.Director Victor Fleming will be always remembered for directing this film, nevertheless even if he never repeated such allure he directed some other excellent ones as this film,The Wizard of Oz(1939),Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde (1941)andJoan of Arc, this last film is IMHO very underrated, deserving better treatment.A Classic movie you should see and appreciate!Reviewed by Max Yofre."	5.0	Scarlett O'Hara against the Whole World!	2008-05-27	1	1	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A7LCXKSK0W7J6	Melissa Jordan	"I was taken to see GWTW in 1939 when I was three years old, probably because my mother and grandmother couldn't put me somewhere else for the afternoon.  All I remember of that viewing was Rhett carrying Scarlett up the red carpeted stairs.  Since then I have seen the film several times, but nothing prepared me for the wonderful technicolor film of the present version.Originally I purchased this Ultimate Collector's Edition of GWTW from Amazon mostly for the additional DVDs describing the technical improvements and the background of making the movie.  I sure wasn't disappointed.  But beyond that, everything about this purchase, from the velvet covered box to the inclusion of the made-for-TV movie ""The Scarlett O'Hara War"" at the end of the 5th DVD was enchanting. The color, the sound, the extras about the actors, the history, all were everything I hoped for.I sent a second set to my 16 year-old grandson who has amassed a library of over 100 classic movies and who has been scripting, filming, and producing films on his own since he was 10.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3N0HBW8IP8CZQ	"Melissa P. Cooper ""kymissyin"""	Like most every self-respecting Southern woman I know, I read the book growing up.  My mother warned me while I was reading it that Scarlett was as &quot;mean as a snake&quot;--but I found her as fascinating as she was flawed.  I couldn't understand her attraction to Ashley when a real man like Rhett was around, but when she swore to burn Tara to the ground rather than let the Yankees have it. . .now THAT I could understand.  Scarlett had not been bred for the harsh realities of post-Civil-War life in the deep South, but I always saw her as a poker player who was just trying to make the best of the hand she was dealt.Had the film tried to be completely faithful to the book, they would have had to release it as a series with sequels to get all the details and develop the characters with as much depth as Margaret Mitchell did.  But that wasn't how it was done back then. In the late 1930s, during the Great Depression, the producers took a big chance getting this one movie made--they had to give MGM an arm, a leg, and a kidney to get Clark Gable for the role of Rhett (and he did NOT want to do it).  Sequels would probably not have been an option or even a consideration under the conditions they were working.  But the movie can stand alone--thanks to the gifts and work of Gable, Vivien Leigh, and especially Olivia De Havilland--who gave Melanie a backbone of steel behind that &quot;Southern Lady&quot; exterior.I have watched this at least once every five years since I was a teenager.  With each phase of my own life, I see something different in the performances each time.  I never caught the innuendo in the dialogue and those smoldering looks between Gable and Leigh until I was in my 20s.  By the time I was 30, I'd read that she could barely tolerate him, because he was drinking on the set and his breath stunk--and marvel at how none of that came through in her work.What's never changed is that I always cry during Rhett's scenes after Scarlett's miscarriage and when their little girl has her accident, as well as the final scenes between Scarlett and Melanie.  As in the love scenes between Scarlett and Rhett, there is a subtext to the dialogue that goes far beyond what's being said.  You might not catch it until you've experienced a few heartaches and battles yourself, as these two women did.I've neither seen nor read the sequel &quot;Scarlett.&quot;  And I don't plan to.  Margaret Mitchell was asked repeatedly, &quot;well, what happens next?&quot;  And she always said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;  Neither do I.  Where she ended it is where it ends for me, too.  See it for yourself and draw your own conclusions.This one is an American classic.  Buy it.	5.0	Classic, cream-of-the-crop epic and chick flick	2001-02-12	5	4	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"With great fanfare in 1939 and an all-star cast, a landmark film opened in theaters across America that told the fictional story about a strong-willed Southern woman named Scarlett O'Hara.  Raised on an affluent, slave-owning, cotton-growing plantation, Scarlett's life was influenced by surviving the 1860's American Civil War, her obsessive (but impossible) love for the man Ashley Wilkes and the several men that she married instead.  Based upon Margaret Mitchell's (1900-1949) epic novel, the 238-minute long ""Gone With the Wind"" was one of the first full-length motion pictures filmed entirely in color.  Under the direction of the legendary Victor Fleming (1889-1949), who also directed the equally classic 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Gone With the Wind"" begins with a lavish party at the Tara Plantation in the state of Georgia.  After being attended to by her Mammy (Hattie McDaniel, 1895-1952) for the party, Scarlett (Vivien Leigh, 1913-1967) ventures out into the party to the attention of several would-be suitors, but she has her eyes only on Ashley (Leslie Howard, 1893-1943).  However, to Scarlett's consternation, Ashley has already consented to marry a distant cousin from the north, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland).  With the sudden announcement that the Civil War has started and that many of the young men are going off to fight (including Ashley), Scarlett makes the rash decision of marrying her first inappropriate suitor Charles Hamilton (Rand Brooks, 1918-2003) after she unexpectedly meets Rhett Butler (Clark Gabel, 1901-1960).  Never actually having loved Charles, Scarlett regrets having to be in mourning after he is killed in the war, which isn't going well for the South.  While staying with her Aunt Pittypat Hamilton (Laura Hope Crews, 1879-1942) in Atlanta, Scarlett begrudgingly does her Confederate duty of helping to tend to the wounded.  In one of the most compelling parts of the film, Scarlett is torn between fleeing Atlanta, helping to tend to wounded Confederate troops or helping the pregnant Melanie.  Begrudgingly, Scarlett helps Melanie deliver the baby with the assistance of Prissy (Butterfly McQueen, 1911-1995) before fleeing the burning Atlanta with the much-needed, but undesirable, help of Rhett Butler.  The life of starvation, poverty and carpetbaggers that Scarlett and everyone else at Tara face immediately after the war hardens Scarlett greatly.  Her decision that she must do anything to ensure her & her relatives' survival & prosperity in the future sets much of the tone for rest of the story.For 1939, the cinematography and special effects in ""Gone With the Wind"", as well as the superb acting from all of the actors and the brilliant story itself, makes watching the film just as engaging and entertaining today as it was 65 years ago.  However, some viewers today may find the portrayal of some of the African-American characters offensive because of the stereotypes that were more prevalent when the film was produced.  In spite of this, the film has endured and I am happy to see it released in an extraordinary set of 4 DVD's (2 for the film and 2 with a lot of documentaries about many of the films actors and the making of the film itself).  Other memorable characters include Gerald O'Hara (Thomas Mitchell, 1892-1962), Suellen O'Hara (Evelyn Keyes), Big Sam (Everett Brown, 1902-1953), Frank Kennedy (Carroll Nye, 1901-1974) and Dr. Meade (Harry Davenport, 1866-1949).  Overall, I rate ""Gone With the Wind"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It remains a cinematic masterpiece that has influenced many a filmmaker since."	5.0	"""As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!"""	2004-11-04	13	9	4
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A29D6Q4Y5RA503	M	Growing up I had never really heard of Gone With the Wind. I mean, I must have its referenced all the time in pop culture but I never really gotten the really understood what was going on. The more popular quotes from Gone With the Wind are funny on their own anyway. But that all changed in the 5th grade. For some reason, and I am not really sure what possessed me, I decided to read Gone With the Wind.I got it from the local library that summer, and set about trying to read it. At first, Gone With the Wind wasn't really my style. But something clicked and I fell in love. I have read that book at least 5 times, and my record timing for reading it is about 2 days. After I finished the book, I decided to watch the movie.  Now I entered with trepidation, because as any good book reader knows, movies are NEVER as good as their books. And at first I was disappointed. The sheer amount of plot detail left out almost made me cry.But then I stopped to actually enjoy the film. And when I did I fell in love. Skipping over the fact that major characters were omitted, it stuck pretty closely to the plot of the story. The cuts were pretty necessary, considering the film was about 3 or 4 hours long but the details were absolutely stunner. The dresses were magnificent, and scenery was spectacular, and just they way everything was played out. It was just wonderful. Definitely worth the 3 hours![...]	5.0	Frankly my Dear	2012-03-09	4	3	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2QLKGXV6SFDIY	"Michael De Lazzer ""Michael"""	"I recently re-watched this epic.  On a laptop.  On DVD.  On a plane.  I remember this film from my youth.  Mother always told me, ""It's a masterpiece.""  And I've always considered it as such.  I can forgive the antiquated effects and the backdrops, they don't concern me, actually a bit charming in their own way.  But.. getting back to the plane thing.. as a white male, I found myself most uncomfortable watching this film where someone else could see me watching it.  It started off in grand fashion, but when the movie progressed a little, I felt red under the collar and flush in the face.  I had to turn it off.  I felt as if I'd turned on an x-rated film in a public forum.  Perhaps I'm overly sensitive, but hey, I'm from L.A.  We're thought of as fairly open-minded out here.  I guess I'd say, if you like the movie fine.  It's a great love story.  There are some captivating scenes.  I did finish watching it when I got to my destination.. South Africa, no kidding.  But this movie hasn't aged very well in my eyes.  Perhaps it's that we've seen so many great historical-based movies in the last 10 years.. Saving Private Ryan perhaps is the best example because the story is fictional but the situation is historically accurate... I'd like to see this movie re-made in that way.  It's difficult to excuse the glossing over of human ownership by today's standards.  I suppose you could argue that the way slavery is treated in this film is important if only to remind us of how our society was before the civil rights movement.  Not that I'm suggesting that we're there yet, either... remember, I do live in L.A.

The human hardship and suffering, brought on by the Civil War and by the selfish actions of Scarlett O'Hara, are still just as relevant and just as powerful today!  It's a story so intense and compelling, you'll get sucked into these characters and fall in love with them again and again in every viewing.Before there was TV, and soap operas, this is the original, ultimate, grand cinematic soap opera.

It is a highly entertaining melodrama with a unique point of view, detailed and accurate historical settings and skillful camera use.It is characterized also by superb acting and has an appeal to the viewer that war is the worst thing that a human being can experience and, often, is supremely destructive and meaningless.The DVD updates all the cinematic features and provides images with a new and powerful dimension not available in the VHS format.It is a perfect film and one of the greatest of all time.	5.0	Gone With the Wind	2005-09-29	6	4	2

My grandmother first introduced me to this movie and I've owned a copy since it first came out on DVD.  Based upon one of the best-written novels of all time, the film is outstanding in it's own right.  Covering the war from the viewpoint of it's heroine, Scarlett O'Hara, 'Gone With the Wind' explores the effects of the war on a well-to-do Southern family and the plantation they live on, Tara.  A wonderful character study, Scarlett and her romantic interest, Rhett Butler, do what they must to survive in trying times.  The characters are not perfect, never sappy, and always mesmerizing.  This is simply a film you should own - not rent - and share with your family and friends.  Timeless, even if you normally do not enjoy vintage films!	5.0	Everyone should own a copy of this	2008-09-05	3	2	1
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1NWYOWQCCOC7F	"M. Jay Babb ""Jay"""	"Like most people, I buy DVDs because I like the movie. That's a given. However, what do you do if you already have the 2004 4 disc set? The first thing you need to decide: Is the new stuff worth it? This set was released in 2009-so I decided to wait until the price came down as the Original price was $70 or more.The biggest selling point to buy this set was the movie ""The Scarlett O'Hara war"" I really enjoyed it even though it is obvious that Tony Curtis is too old to play David Selznick. Selznick was 34 years old at the time. Tony Curtis was much older than that in 1980.The Various collectables included does provide lots of Eye candy to be sure. The best of these is the reproduction of the 1939 program-It is actually big enough for me to read. Usually when these come with DVD sets-they are so small-you can't read it. These collectables are fine, but they are not essential to the film.The DVDs come in two fold out cases inside the big box. One has two discs-which is the movie and the second one has 3 discs which are the bonus features. The first 4 discs are identical to the 2004 4 disc set-the 5th disc is new that has already mentioned movie and 2 other documentaries. It also has a CD sampler of the Soundtrack which I haven't heard as of this writing.1939 was Hollywood's biggest year and this movie tops them all!"	5.0	Scarlet O'Hara War and other goodies	2013-05-25	2	0	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2ZHMIV9HPSFDI	M. Mayes	"There is a poetry about a great film that has resonance for all time. The best example of this may be ""Gone With the Wind"". Noble and ignoble characters stand side by side in this breathless story of Scarlett O'Hara and the reasons she invented, found and followed to propel her spirit and body toward survival. Admirable, this heroine? No, not always and so she is a keen reflection of the essence of humanity and the inner workings of a mind that has gallantry and self-obsession working hand in hand. Sometimes fascinating, sometimes despicable--but always human and more to be pitied than despised for having gained the world and lost her soul.For the new Ultra Resolution dvd release, Warner Home Video has pulled out all the stops and made this film look sharp, dazzling and served with the best spectrum of color ever. The dvd shows the film practically without a scratch on it and the sharpness of the production design aides the story and characters more than ever on their long trek to self-realization.Costume textures look as if you could touch them and the detail springs out as never before. The colors all around are glorious and show more shading in the complexions of the actors and inform the time of day or night of the action better than ever.There's no real need to go on about the great actors and the evergreen themes that involve the audience. It's always worth repeating that Vivien Leigh is perfect as Scarlett O'Hara and that it is perhaps the most timeless performance in movie history.The extras are all quite nice-""Making of A Legend"" is always one of the most fun docs ever of this genre. Behlmer's competent commentary will only be truly informative to people who haven't read the many books devoted to the film. The bios on Leigh and Gable are fine. The preview trailers interesting. But the delight of this is the interview with Olivia De Havilland. We are lucky to hear about life in and around the filming straight from Melanie.For anyone interested in films, who loves movies, this will be the one that convinces you that maybe it's not about ""old"" or ""classic"" films...that, perhaps, it's all just films--bad, good and-like ""Gone With the Wind""-great.."	5.0	Eloquence on the human spirit unmatched	2004-11-26	11	9	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2QWEFSPX33C5L	Modrnknght	"From the first moment when you unwrap the plastic surrounding this box set, you know you are in for a treat. The (red) velvet feel of the box in your fingers is unlike any I have experienced with any DVD or Blu-ray set before now...and why not, this movie has been considered the greatest film ever made. Does it deserve any less than the best packaging there has ever been? With its ""70th Anniversary Gone With the Wind"" in gold letters on all four sides set against the red velvet...aw, sheer ecstacy.But then, a moment of panic...what if the interior doesn't match up to such a buildup (much the same worry the audience probably had in 1939 prior to geting to see GWTW after such a massive buildup)? But there is absolutely nothing to fear. When you open it up, you are greeted with a picture of Scarlet O'Hara on the inner lid. If upon opening the lid, had I heard the Tara theme suddenly playing (you don't), I would not have been surprised. This truly looks and feels like a beautiful treasure box.Inside, you find a 52-page hardcover photo and production art book. While not filled with the detailed behind-the-scenes writing of the similar Wizard of Oz book, the photos and artwork will please any GWTW fan.Next is the reproduction of the original 40-page souvenir program (there were two versions issued, one with Hattie McDaniel pictured on the backcover with the other stars and one for the South without her. This is the one with her). Unlike the repro issued with the 2005 DVD set, this program is almost the same size as the original program (this one measures approx. 7.5 x 10 inches).After this you get several pages of David O. Selznick memos and other correspondence. Nice touch.What's that, you want more? Okay, how about 10 5x7 color cards showing production drawings in a nice folder called ""The Art of Gone With the Wind""? How about a CD with approximately 35 minutes of music from the soundtrack?There is a four page booklet that serves a directory of what are on the three discs in the set. Then some promotional flyers for TCM DVDs and other items. (I thought there was going to be a promotional offer for the GWTW poster but either it is missing from my set or they changed their mind about that as there is no mention anywhere on the outer listing of items about any such offer.)Now, all that wasn't enough, we now get to the heart of the box, the very lovely (and STURDY) foldout containing the Blu-ray disc containing the movie, the Blu disc with the extras, and the double-sided DVD that has the fabulous 6-hour documentary, ""MGM: When the Lion Roars.""The high definition print is beautiful. The work done on this really shows. The scenes may not jump out at you screaming how much it has been restored, but when you look at the sharpness, the clean clarity of the picture, you know that unless you have seen it in the theatre you have never seen it looking so good.One weakness is in the audio. Though it has a Dolby True HD track, I found myself having to crank up the volume to be heard normally.The movie comes with the commentary by Rudy Behlmer from the previous DVD release.The movie is alone on the first disc. The goodies are all on the second one...The bulk of them have been ported over from the DVD prior edition, but now we also get to enjoy the wonderful documentary, ""1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year"" and the made-for-TV drama of ""Moviola: The Scarlett O'Hara War."" I hadn't seen the latter since the Moviola mini-series first aired those decades ago, and I groaned inwardly as I watched the opening credits and saw who was cast in some of the most important roles (Tony Curtis as Selznick, Sharon Gless as Carole Lombard, to name two), but upon starting to view it, I found myself enjoying it for what it was. (And, happily, the video quality is far superior to that of The Dreamer of Oz, the John Ritter TV-movie in the Oz set.)Be happy, this box set is all you could hope it would be."	5.0	The ultimate collector's package for the ultimate movie	2012-12-23	2	2	0
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	"I always remember this being one of those great Hollywood achievements so I was stoked to see it again in a Blu ray transfer.  This particular version includes one disc with no extras beyond a commentary by historian Rudy Behlmer.  The picture retains the original 1:33:1 aspect ratio but gives viewers a choice of the original mono or a souped-up Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The picture and sound are excellent given the age of the film.Speaking of the age.  This film certainly would have trouble with political correctness in today's world.  Author Margaret Mitchell and producer David O. Selznick have no problem delivering this story from the southern Confederate viewpoint.  It is often pointed out how if they lose the war against the North, their genteel, formal, elegant way of life would be lost.  True that.  That would mean an end to slavery which was the engine of the economy of the South.  This allowed the white landowners to live their life of leisure and luxury.  And the black slaves (including their children) seem to have no problem serving their masters in this movie.  All that aside, the movie really is a well done lengthy soap opera.  Vivien Leigh is very good and was appropriately awarded an Oscar for her role as Scarlett O'Hara.  Always scheming, Scarlett is portrayed from a teenager to adulthood.  She is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but Ashley instead marries his cousin (yep, that's right) Melanie (Olivia de Havilland) who is the complete opposite of Scarlett.  Melanie is kind, thoughtful, generous and just about perfect.  Scarlett, gorgeous though she is, differs like night and day.  Only Ashley realizes this.  His personality is more in tune with Melanie.The Scarlett/Ashley romantic attraction never goes away, even after Rhett Butler enters the picture as someone more like Scarlett.  Rhett falls for Scarlett just like every other man who meets her.  She is attracted by his wealth, position and well, he's a bit of a scoundrel.  Of course the film shows its age in many ways.  It is overly dramatic at times and politically one-sided (all the Yankees are scum) but damn, I still like it.  The winner of 10 Academy Awards, ""Gone with the Wind"" is Hollywood melodrama at its best."	4.0	Oscar winning melodrama of the old South	2012-02-08	4	4	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2H89O0DRWMS4V	MonteCristo	A movie that did not do anything revolutionary except display itself as an epic story. While not regarded as great as Fleming was, he directed this epic along with Wizard of Oz, both widely viewed by the young and old alike. The only thing one can ask themself while watching this film is couldn't have this been cut down to half the amount of time? The second half of the film deals a lot with just Scarlett's bratty behavior and not caring for anyone else. And for the reviewer E.Brunsvold; anybody that knows their movie trivia knows that Widescreen was not used in film until the 50's when the adoption of television began to sweep across America. This film is from 1939, be happy that it's in color, as it was one of the first major films that used the new color film during that time. That's why one of its oscars is for using color in a creative manner. So no widescreen now, no widescreen ever. Just enjoy.	5.0	Truly an Epic	2003-12-06	4	3	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A185RNNKCBI2HW	MovieMan12	What more needs to be said? Everyone has discussed how Gone with the Wind is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made, and they're right. As for the Four-Disc Collector's Edition from 2004, there is much to be said.The first two discs are home to the film, which is preserved in its original full-screen viewing presentation, and has been remastered quite nicely. On disc three, we are given a slew of interesting extras regarding the film. The grand buffet is the classic-in-its-own-right 1989 documentary &#34;The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind,&#34; narrated by Christopher Plummer and runs just over two hours. This is one of the most well-made documentaries produced for a film ever created. We are also treated with footage from the original Atlanta premiers for the film-one from 1939, another from 1961. The final neat inclusion is &#34;The Old South,&#34; a short that MGM showed before Gone with the Wind in theaters. Also included are a slew of great trailers, an opening created for international prints of the movie that explained the Civil War, and a featurette detailing the creation of the movie.On disc four, the extras are centered on the stars. First, we get, &#34;Clark Gable: A King Remembered,&#34; an hour-long doc from 1975 detailing Clark Gable's career. Next is, &#34;Melanie Remembers: Olivia de Havilland Recalls Gone With The Wind,&#34; which is exactly what it says on the tin. A perfect companion to Gable's documentary is, &#34;Vivien Leigh: Scarlett and Beyond,&#34; which does the same, detailing Leigh's short career. There are also other documentaries for the other actors and actresses in the film.Overall, this DVD set of Gone with the Wind is essential to any movie fan, or any breathing person in general. This belongs next to the four-disc set of &#34;Ben-Hur&#34; and the three disc sets of &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; and &#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34; as the building bricks in any movie library.	5.0	An Amazing Set	2014-06-07	1	1	0
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2XRZV63X79YSJ	"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector"""	Gone with the Wind is considered one of the greatest films ever made.  And I agree.  This DVD set is worthy of this film.This is a four hour film.  It starts in pre Civil War south.  It shows what the south was like before the war, during the early stages of the war when victory was possible, during the later stages of the war when loss was imminent and the rebuilding after the war.  This is all seen through the eyes of a southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara.To say Scarlett is self absorbed is a mild statement.  She is the prettiest girl in the south.  But she is in love with Ashley who is love with his cousin Melanie.  Enter rogue Rhett Butler.  He is the complete opposite of Scarlett and that is what attracts him to her.When Ashley announces his marriage to Melanie, Scarlett retaliates by accepting a proposal from Melanie's brother Charles.  Scarlett and a pregnant Melanie are sent away to Atlanta.  Scarlett becomes a widow (not through war but illness).  While in Atlanta Scarlett does not take well to widowhood and shocks the city by dancing with Rhett.The tide of the war is changing and Atlanta is no longer safe.  Melanie has the baby the night Atlanta is being burned.  Rhett finds transport out for Scarlett and Melanie.  (This part of the film is the most visually wrenching.)  Scarlett and Melanie return to Tara.  (End Disc One)The war is almost over.  Twelve Oaks is burned down.  Scarlett, her sisters and Melanie are working Tara to feed themselves with the help of some of the freed slaves.  Eventually, Ashley returns.  Unfortunately taxes are assessed on Tara and Scarlett cannot raise the money.  She first tries to get it from Rhett (The famous curtain into dress scene) but he doesn't have the money.  Then she finds out that her sister's boyfriend Frank Kennedy has some money and she marries him.  She builds his hardware business into a major concern.  After an altercation in the slums, Frank is killed and Ashley badly injured.Finally, Scarlett is free and Rhett is wanting.  They finally marry.  Everything is wonderful and they have a lovely daughter Bonnie Blue. For Rhett life could not be better.  He has everything that he wants.  That is until Bonnie Blue is killed in a riding accident.  This is when Rhett finally breaks down.  Things spiral down for Rhett and Scarlettt,  Then Melanie dies and her final words are to Scarlettt asking her to watch over Ashley.  At that moment, Scarlettt realizes that it's Rhett who she is in love with but is it too late.I have a rule that if a film is over 2 and one half hours that every scene must be necessary.  At four hours, there is not one extraneous scene in the film.George Cukor directed most of the film and he got performances that every actor in the film would be identified with for the rest of their lives.  This is probably one of the best performed movies ever.DVD EXTRAS:Disc 3 -Making of a Legend: Gone with the Wind - A two hour 1988 documentary about the film narrated by Christopher Plummer made by Ted Turner for the 50th anniversary of the film.  This is a very comprehensive documentary and very interesting.Restoring a Legend - An 18 minute featurette about restoring films to their original look.Dixie Hails Gone with the Wind - The 4 minute newsreel on the opening of the film.Historical Theatrical Short: The Old South - A 11 minute MGM documentary short subject made to promote GWTW.  This is an interesting featurette that shows Hollywood's typical portrayal of the south and blacks during the late 30's.Atlanta Civil War Centennial - 3 minute newsreel footage on the 1961 rerelease of the film as part of the Civil War Centennial.International Prologue - The one minute prologue that proceeded international releases of the film.Foreign Language Versions - The opening scene in French, the bridge scene with Rhett and Scarlettt in Italian and the burning of Atlanta in German (3 minutes)Disc 4 - Featurettes about and sometimes by the castMelanie Remembers: Reflections by Olivia De Havilland - A 39 minute interview with Olivia De Havilland filmed for this release.  De Havilland is a great actress but she tends to be too sweet in the interviews.Gable: The King Remembered - An hour film about Gable hosted by Peter Lawford made in 1975.  This is very dated and doesn't really delve into his myth.Vivien Leigh: Scarlett and Beyond - A 46 minute 1990 documentary about Vivien hosted by Jessica Lange made for TCM.  This is a very interesting featurette about an actress whose life was even more tragic than her film roles.The Supporting Cast - Short vignettes on each of the supporting cast.  Most lasting about one minute except Leslie Howard, Thomas Mithcell, Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2BSRSOG7B2RSI	Mr. H. C. Orr	"As I said in my Blu-ray review of ""North By Northwest"", when major studios really want to get it together for BD releases, they can make really impressive products. ""Gone With The Wind"" is a perfect marriage of Hollywood nous, production values and acting bravura: similarly, the Blu-ray release gets the full-on treatment, in terms of restoration of the original print and extras.""Gone With The Wind"" is a fantastic investment on Blu-ray. Technicolor films from the 1930s and 1940s tend to look ravishing, paradoxically because of the lessened colour palette (see also ""The Adventures Of Robin Hood"" (1938)). Respected production designer William Cameron Menzies was behind the ""look"" of GWtW, and envisaged rich colour alternating with muted tones for more melancholic scenes: the Blu-ray captures his vision triumphantly, with wonderfully dark blacks, glowing oranges and reds, and sombre greys all equally rendered. Although the transfer is only in 4:3, when you get over the fact there is no pseudo-widescreen option (as there was on the DVD of ""Snow White"" in that BD combi pack) the quality of the images is in my opinion flawless.As for extras, the second disc abounds with interesting documentaries and cast biographies that add to the experience of one of the genuinely biggest films ever made."	5.0	The Golden Age In Blu.

My mother saw this film at the movies in 1939 and it is her favorite movie! My parents are up for a visit and I decided to break out my 4 disc edition of this American classic and watch it with my parents! This film is made for a larger screen and my home theater was just what the doctor ordered. First off the print and transfer on this 4 disc edition is exceptional! I was amazed at the tight crisp picture and clear audio. The extras are also above and beyond. The movie itself holds up extremely well and moves along much faster than the you would think for a film that is almost four hours long! My mother still thinks this is the best picture ever made and I must admit it is excellent. I may agree that it could be the greatest film from that time period, but not my personal favorite of all time. A masterpiece in story telling that is almost like reading a book.

Some include: when Melanie and Ashley are speaking in front of the big window as the men leave for the war, when the casualty lists are being distributed, and of course when Scarlett makes her famous speech on the hill outside of Tara.My boyfriend also likes this movie very much.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2WHH346Y9ADRG	M. S. Driver	"""Gone With the Wind"" is a terrific film and probably the best possible cinematic rendering of Margaret Mitchell's 1,000-page novel, but I hope that fans of the movie are also well acquainted with the book.  While most novels are much better than the films made from them, audiences usually prefer to take the short cut and just see the film.  It's their loss.Sure, the book's very long and not p.c. at all, but it's a fast and vivid read (though somewhat repetitive) that supplies a tremendous amount of thoroughly researched historical and literary detail missing from the movie.Although both book and film harbor some nasty attitudes and demeaning speech patterns, I think it's very important for those who have only seen GWTW on the screen to know how author and studio differed in their respective approaches toward their subject and their characters.  Ms. Mitchell was surely allowed her input during filmmaking, but a number of unnecessary alterations crept in that don't seem quite right.Both versions carry the same powerful anti-war message, but the book makes a clearer implication that a plantation culture built on slavery is inherently doomed, and the author has less of the filmakers' nostalgia for the Dear Old Days.  The movie's cloyingly sunny portrayal of slavery is fortunately tempered in the novel.Another theme -- present in the film but heavily expounded in the book -- is that Old South society (and its tenacious postwar ghost) also held its WOMEN in bondage.  While the screen Scarlett seems only to be fighting for food, Tara and Ashley, the Scarlett of the novel, the daughter of a free-thinking Irishman, has from the beginning been engaged in a private war for personal freedom of which she seems scarcely aware (with Rhett and Melanie as her only allies).  Her thought processes are re-examined by the author at each battle.  In the end she can't accept her brilliant victories, and she brings herself to grief by her stubborn pursuit of a useless ideal.  If the film viewer wonders why this is, the book reader knows that Scarlett also takes after her mother, who as a girl had also failed in the pursuit of hopeless love.Ms. Mitchell gives her main Black characters (Prissy excepted) far more dignity and authority than they have in the movie:  Pork isn't such a whiner; Pittypat's Uncle Peter isn't this Willie Best type (chasing the Christmas-dinner rooster) but has status in his family just as Mammy does in hers; Big Sam is not the goofy field foreman arguing over ""quittin' time"", but is promoted to capable overseer after Jonas Wilkerson is fired.  This is not to condone the racism, but it isn't quite so bad in the book.Even the Yankees get a little break:  a kind army doctor quartered at Tara ministers to Scarlett's two sick sisters.In order to keep a tight plot, the sceenwriter had to omit many characters (such as Scarlett's other two kids), which may leave a few vague questions in the viewer's mind that are answered by the novel:Who's running Tara in Scarlett's absence?  The book provides a homeless veteran with farming skills who eventually saves Suellen from dreaded spinsterhood.Why does Jonas Wilkerson disappear as a threat to Tara after his takeover attempt?  Well, one of the County boys, missing from the film, takes care of him.Can Melanie's baby digest cow's milk?  He doesn't have to.  Prissy's midwife mother (who never taught her ""'bout birthin' babies"") actually exists and is there to help.Also absent from the film are:  the wonderful horsey daily life of the pre-war County; Gerald O'Hara's biography and how he won the hand of a young society girl from Savannah; the true cause of Gerald's rage that led to his death; the interesting details of the Confederates' leap-frog defense of Atlanta.One customer reviewer here finds the second half of the film more disjointed than the first half.  This is because the post-war section of the book covers a much greater time span and variety of events in the characters' lives.At only one point does the film outclass the novel, and that is in the last couple of scenes and Gable's parting shot. (Actually, Gable's entire performance is a major asset.)  But then it goes and dulls the edge by dwelling on Scarlett's dewy-eyed hope of getting him back.  At the end of the book her prospects don't seem so certain:  Can she really get him back or is she just as blind as ever?  And how can she live at Tara with Suellen as its mistress?"	4.0	READ THE BOOK, TOO.	2002-04-07	19	16	3

Youngman	"On the question of widescreen/fullscreen - those who say GWTW was originally released in a 'fullscreen' format, are you going by the thought that widescreen did not exist yet? or were you there to see it?  I first saw GWTW in the mid-seventies in a theater.  Loved it but can't say I recall specifics of scenes etc.  Again in the mid or late 80's it was released to theaters with some color restoration.  I saw it 4 times in 2 weeks.  Could almost say every line.  There is a specific scene, where Scarlet is talking to Charles Hamilton, they are sitting in the front of a buggy or wagon, and Mammie is sitting behind them.  Mammie's reactions to Scarlet's lies build gradually as Scarlet heaps lie upon lie.  I can remember watching Hattie McDaniel and considering it one of many scenes which really showed how she deserved the oscar.  In all subsequent viewings - on TV and in the 90's theatrical release which showed on the little screen in the multiplex - all one sees is Scarlet and Charles talking, then a pan to Mammie's (by that time) overdone and comical reaction.If the original was not filmed in widescreen, then where did that footage of Hattie McDaniel come from that I saw so many times?Did it get ""added in"" later?  I kind of doubt it.5 stars for the movie itself - one of the greatest of all time!Truly a spectacular Hollywood production."	5.0	widescreen question	2004-12-17	10	3	7

I was fourteen and had already read the book eight times. Yes, the movie isn't exactly like the book but what they left out didn't really change the whole point.It's a story of a woman who grows up privileged only to have it all snatched away. She becomes desperate and hungry enough that she will do anything to never feel that way again. However, she is not just thinking of herself as some people say. She wants to save her home for her family and for the sake of the memories she has of its former grandeur.To Lance who says they made up a war for this movie... Ummm, that will truly surprise the inhabitants of northern and central Georgia who know that most of the old pre-1865 houses in that part of the state were burned down by the advancing Union Army. Have you heard of a little disagreement called the Civil War (War Between the States, or War of Northern Aggression, depending on your POV)? Took place 1860-1865 best I recall... FYI. Look it up.And as far as the war in GWTW, they got it right. It is a wonderful picture of what life in Atlanta during the war was like.	5.0	This is my all-time favorite movie!	2004-11-06	21	13	8

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3DDPQ9342UNMY	"N. Doyle ""film buff"""	"Just as Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was one of the most readable works ever written, so is David O. Selznick's production one of the most watchable films of all time. Something is happening every moment--and all of the characters relate to each other in fascinating ways only apparent after repeated viewings. It's the kind of movie that transports you to a time and place that may not have existed except in the mind of its Southern author--and yet, whatever historical inaccuracies are presented here--it's a remarkable achievement and has rightly become a part of American folklore and culture.No other film has so many memorable ""quotes"" from a large cast of characters--and at the centerpiece is Vivien Leigh's striking performance as the willful Southern belle. Others around her are equally impressive, down to the smallest character roles--everyone has their moment of glory with the only weakness being the casting of Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes. Otherwise, the casting is perfect--Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland, Thomas Mitchell, Barbara O'Neil, Evelyn Keyes, Harry Davenport, Jane Darwell, Victor Jory, Ann Rutherford, Rand Brooks, Ona Munson--and the wonderful Hattie McDaniel giving the most genuine display of emotion in the whole film with her ""staircase scene"" with Melanie when she tells Scarlett's friend what Rhett has said and done after Bonnie's death.All of the sets, costumes, art direction and photography are of the highest order. William Cameron Menzie's production design is superb (he storyboarded the whole concept of what the scenes should look like with beautiful watercolor paintings). The one film above all others that shows what Hollywood's expertise could do with a gigantic novel when transferring it to the screen.Much of the dialog is witty and pointed with some of the best lines delivered in mocking style by Clark Gable. An abundant amount of humor and sharp observations about human nature are present in the script. No wonder it's still the most beloved American movie of all time--not just here in the U.S. but elsewhere in the international market. It was an instant classic and still remains one, richly deserving all eight of the Oscars it won, as well as the Irving G. Thalberg Award for David O. Selznick.Selznick would have been proud of what the Ultra-Resolution process has been able to achieve in the new 4-Disc version.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3W3VEFDTRKQAJ	Nene	I must be in the minority about this movie-I don't like it. I don't like the people-in my opinion, they're shallow, ridiculous, narrow-minded and childish. I don't like the role of women in those days-all you had to do was wear pretty clothes and act like an airhead to catch a husband. If you don't do these things, you're an outcast. I especially don't like Scarlett O'Hara. I so can't believe that that woman couldn't make up her mind about what man to be with-I mean, Leslie Howard over Clark Gable? Give me a break! Casablanca is more my movie-at least Rick and Ilsa were more mature than Scarlett and Rhett. I don't like this film at all, and I don't understand what's so great about it.	1.0	I must be in the minority.	2006-06-04	58	3	55

For 98% percent of the time she's being mean,lying,fake,cunning,flirty,snively,whiney,selfish,sneaky,angry,tantrum throwing,anoying,silly,cruel,herselfminded,ect.You get the point.She at first is just a gossipy boygrabber.With one intent on her mind:Ashlene!A young man a bit shy and noble.Oh curse this Hara crush.I ruins her life! She sees hes going to marry his cousin Melony.So what does she do?Like a horrible uncaring person she goes and marrys another young man who she doesn't give doller for.Hoping this ploy will work to regain Ashlenes love before she actually does this,IT FAILS! (HORRAY.GOOD FOR MELONY!)So she ends up marrying the poor other bloke.Fortuantly for her,He dies off at war with anomia! Happy Day for Scarlet.(HAppy for that poor fellow having to live with a woman like that.)Who Cares?Only problem is she has to still wear black and can't dance at Balls and such.And somthing she should be arware of is she keeps coming with Frank Butler.A Gallant,swagger of a man he finds Scarlet more and more attractive every time they meet.Why doesn't Scarlet just shut up instead of bugging poor Ashly? I don't feel to sooorry for her in the end when she runs wailing(Croadile tears?)after Frank........TARA! the final word!	5.0	Scarlet wastes every good thing that comes her way..........	2003-08-30	6	1	5

This movie was way ahead of its time.  The whole movie was filmed in Technicolor which in 1939 was unheard of.  For a time, there was fear that this movie might have been destroyed like so many classics have been.  Thanks to the efforts of Turner and American Movie Classics they have worked hard to restore a lot of the classic films and saved them from the careless storage practices that were practiced in the early 20th century.Unlike LombaireFan ""LF"", I was very impressed by the extras offered and was not upset that Gable, Leigh and Cukor could not sit down to offer a running commentary since they have been busy being DEAD for many years."	5.0	A True Classic	2004-11-09	10	7	3

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3DYIGOLWS5CNS	Niel Rishoi	"For the Gone With The Wind movie completist, this loaded set is a must-have. The extras are about as comprehensive as one could want.It's a great movie pretty much across the board in terms of casting, spectacle, compelling storyline, cinematography and production values.  Its few drawbacks don't detract from the overall result - and it's amazing that this 1939 movie remains so compulsively entertaining - but it suffers a bit from credibility in some of the casting, and by the presentation.  It is a pretty realistic depiction of the Civil War, but it is 30s style entertainment. There is a lot of badly placed bits of humor that don't originate in the novel, as if to keep the public charmed (Margaret Mitchell's narrative style - unflinching, hard-hitting - was superb; the juxtaposition of the historical with a complex story is one of the best examples of the historical novel I've ever read) . This was of course, the style of the day, but it does not reflect the novel's tone.  For example, Scarlett herself in the novel was a hardheaded, unsentimental, ruthless woman who had not an ounce of humor within her; in the film, she gets to throw off a lot of flippy, quippy lines that don't accord with her character.  I recall reading in the book Mitchell's description of Scarlett - that her personality was ""lusty with life,"" of an almost ""frightening vitality,"" and despite the ""practiced"" ladylike values instilled into her, that her own, independent spirit was far more attractive than any guise she might adopt.Vivien Leigh always had a tendency to soften her characters somewhat; that might account for her Scarlett being a bit petulant and pouty, a characteristic that didn't originate in the book.  Otherwise, Leigh is ideally cast, and gives a magnificent portrayal on its own terms.  She looks the part to a T, and was especially brilliant in the use of facial expressions to reveal her inner thoughts; Leigh had a way of internalizing her emotions to register with the audience.However, this is Gable's film all the way.  No other actor was such a suitable match to a novel's character.  Tough, tender, sensual, magnetic, masculine and larger-than-life as a dashing blockade runner, Gable's Rhett Butler is one of film's most perfectly realized creations.Hattie MacDaniel's Mammy is also a likewise acted portrayal: she is *exactly* as presented in the novel, shrewd, dignified, razor-sharp and with none of that kow-towing, tee-hee-heeing, subservience usually accorded black characters of the time. Mammy, in the book, was portrayed as Scarlett's voice of conscience, and as a proud, blunt, outspoken woman.The two dubious bits of casting is that of Ashley, and to a much lesser extent, Melanie. Why Selznick thought that Leslie Howard was an appropriate Ashley is beyond me. The crucial framing story is Scarlett's obsession with Ashley, which continues right up to near the end of the novel.  In the book, Ashley was presented as a beautiful Apollonian stud-type of character, a young, tall, blond god and of a Byronesque elegance.  He was a young girl's - Scarlett's - sexual fantasy of a romantic suitor.  But what to make of Leslie Howard in the role?  He's not only on the geeky side, but he's far too old. Worse, though, Howard appears bored to the gills, and has no dash or pizzazz.  We can't then understand Scarlett's obsession with Ashley, when there is Gable's magnetic Rhett, and this is the fundamental motivational flaw of the movie.  We can't fathom how Scarlett can pant over the pallid dullard of Ashley when there is the infinitely more interesting Rhett Butler.Melanie is undoubtedly the most difficult role of all. In the book, Melanie was chronically sick, whose physical frailty eventually overtook her. But she was one of genuine nobility and towering strength of  character, whose inner goodness and sterling qualities remained uncorrupted by the war; all the other characters turned to her for guidance and emotional support.  Olivia de Havilland tries hard to embody this aspect of Melanie, but does not quite succeed.  Not yet the accomplished actress of the later, superb, ""The Heiress,"" de Havilland is too self-conscious in her determination to be a paragon of sterling goodness; the underlying sweetness - which threatens to border into smarminess - is instead ponderous, a little precious, not quite believable. Granted, it is extremely difficult to portray a ""great soul"" type of character, but a greater actress is actually needed than one for Scarlett. De Havilland's finest moment occurs during the Shantytown raid, whereby Melanie tries to read David Copperfield; here the character is, finally, allowed to be the voice of reason during a tense evening. Melanie's death scene falls a bit flat; the massive irony doesn't register, because De Havilland lacked the skills to suggest a catharsis, and because the complexities of the relationships in the novel between all the characters isn't fully fleshed out. Though she would have been too old at the time, there is only one actress I can think of who has this gift for portraying physical frailty allied with an unsullied inner strength: Lillian Gish.  No other actress ever portrayed this kind of feminine, tragic and delicate type of woman so deftly, and only someone of Gish's talents could have made logic and natural sense of such a role as Melanie.If one can ignore the differences between Margaret Mitchell's versus David Selznick's - the former a complex, grim story, the later a romance epic - then both, on their own terms, are classics of their kind."	5.0	Far different from the book, but a classic on its own terms	2005-01-02	10	4	6

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	Gone With The Wind is more than a movie, it's an American pop icon, a true legend in film making and the winner of 9 Academy Awards including Best Picture. I'll spare you a plot summary because by now nearly everyone knows the story.  Just bring Kleenex and be prepared to give a damn!Unfortunately, this film was mastered on DVD by the old MGM, cost cutting regime in the days before Warner assumed control of the Selznick catalogue.  Though the film has been transfered from restored Technicolor elements and the sound has been remixed to 5.1 surround, this is a disappointing visual experience overall when one considers what it might have been.  Colors are well balanced but there is a considerable amount of film grain inherent in the print.  Fine details shimmer throughout, there is considerable edge enhancement in many scenes and often contrast and shadow delineation suffer in extremely dark scenes.  To be sure the sweeping and epic melodrama never fails to captivate.  The transfer just happens to fall short of expectations.  Also, there are no extras, presumably because Warner owns the rights to the Turner documentary, &quot;The Making Of A Legend&quot; and didn't want to loan it out to MGM when the original DVD transfer was being prepared.  Very soon though, Warner Brothers needs to go back to the drawing board on this DVD, give us a remastered print, as well as the documentary, screen tests and other supplimentary material that an essential classic like Gone With The Wind so rightfully deserves.  For it has been said that in the history of American cinema there have only been two movies made - Gone With The Wind and everything else!

While a little racist and misogynistic at times, the film really tells the tale of the South during the Civil War through its main character Scarlett O'Hara.  She mirrors the rise and fall and rebuilding of Georgia and its citizens before, during, and after the Civil War.  The film is funny, heartbreaking, shocking, romantic, and triumphant in ways that are not seen anymore on the silver screen.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1MAKDNQ2H5KNU	"Noelle-Mari Bowen ""Noway!"""	"Ever since the first time I saw this movie on TNT back when I was around 10 years old, I've LOVED ""Gone With the Wind"". At that age, I didn't understand everything that was happening but there was such a certain quality about it that made me see that there was something powerful in it. Also, since then I have seen ""Gone With the Wind"" on a VHS recorded by my grandfather. I don't know why I haven't purchased the DVD (or read the novel!) until just now! I popped that VHS into my VCR a few days ago and fell in love with the movie once again.I'm no movie reviewer but in my humble opinion, I do believe that ""Gone With the Wind"" is the best movie of ALL TIME. And for those who may disagree, I recommend that anybody who can appreciate the arts should watch this movie at least once (or TEN TIMES) in their lives. It's lenghty but well worth the time. I haven't received my DVDs yet but I feel that it will be a good investment. This is definitely a movie I would want my children and grandchildren to watch. Movies like these are just so hard to come by any more.My only disappointments about the movie revolve around the reservations the creators had because of the way movies were made in the 1930s. I certainly would have liked to see more of the passion that from the book in the movie. Even Rhett's last line in the movie caused controversy because he said ""damn""!I think what makes this movie so beautiful and well-loved by many is that it is a timeless masterpiece. It is set around the Civil War era and yet people from the 1930s and surely people from then on until now have been able to relate to the story of the headstrong Scarlett O'Hara. The movie presents ideas that can reach out to everybody. What I love most about the movie is Scarlett who remains true to who she is no matter how people conceive of her.All in all, this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!! I don't even know why anyone would give it less than 5 stars."	5.0	A Timeless Classic	2007-03-03	2	2	0

While it was hard to grasp the entire meaning of the movie at that time, I knew this was more than just another Civil War film. A few years later, I read the original novel on which this was based. Though there are a few minor details that were changed for the movie, on the whole, this is a great film.The plot follows tragedy after tragedy on the plot of searching for love and trying to escape poverty. The fantastic costumes, unearthly beauty of Vivien Leigh and the charming handsomeness of Clark Gable, the extravagant indulgence of the scenery and brilliant camera angles (such as photographing the shadows during melancholy scenes)all adds to one great viewing pleasure.I've seen the movie well over 50 times by now, and you know what?

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3I4EX7TBWUT1U	"""patrick_mcknight"""	"The greatest film ever made?  The culmination of 1930s cinema?  Hardly.Gone With the Wind has got to be the most overrated film of all time.  It is essentially a soap opera made on a grand scale. We watch as Scarlett O'Hara whines her way through the Civil War and Reconstruction while doing stupid things like lusting after her married cousin Ashley Wilkes and using everyone in sight.  Meanwhile, roguish Rhett Butler spends the next four hours grinning and laughing at her exploits in bemusement.  Much like those stupid soap operas on TV, we are expected to be enthralled as the plot goes from nowhere to nowhere and self-destructive characters do self-destructive things.  At least those soap operas last only an hour at most instead of the four hours in this film.  What's worse, after the four hours are up, the film doesn't even come to an end!  Instead, Rhett gives his famous ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" line.  My thoughts exactly.My mother informs me that the point of the film is that the immoral Scarlett O'Hara is strong and can survive the hard times, while the moral Ashley Wilkes is weak and fails.  Huh?  Scarlett doesn't seem to handle her hardships very well to me while Ashley shoulders the burdens and never complains.  It struck me that Scarlett is weak and Ashley is strong.Another thing that irritated me about this film is the poor period detail.  The whole movie seems like a filmed play, which is what it is.  We have to take the character's word for it that there is a war going on somewhere beyond the set walls (the war is never once shown in the film.)  I know, some people are going to say that this was made in the thirties and that's how movies were made then, but I've seen films earlier that this (The Birth of a Nation, The General) that look authentic to this day.  Then there's Max Steiner' score, he essentially repeats the same theme over and over again for four hours.I have tried numerous times to watch this movie all the way through in one sit and failed every time.  I have had to watch it in half hour spurts to get through the entire film.  And I'm an old movie buff.  It's that painful."	2.0	Aaugghh!!!	2002-07-07	32	13	19

If you think this is a great classic work, you'll likely think I'm a moron that couldn't understand it. Oh well, so be it. I just happened to watch the movie recently, and I just couldn't stand it.Early in the movie, Rhett says to Scarlett, in effect, ""you and me, baby, we're a pair of lousy people, you're made for me babe!"" So why on earth does anybody care to watch nearly four hours of a couple of lousy people doing really lousy things? I seriously don't get it at all!But Rhett is too hard on himself, he ain't nearly the equal of Scarlett. Four hours of listening to Scarlett whine and cry at the drop of a hat - Christ I needed some earplugs!I'll have to say, the second hour, involving the burning of Atlanta was the best of the movie. In the first hour, we see Scarlett as a spoiled rich brat entirely unprepared for war. In the second hour, we see her, eventually, pull together some amount of strength. She's kicking and screaming every moment, but she does, finally help deliver the child. And we see Scarlett, just before the intermission, give her famous, ""with God as my witness, I'll never grow hungry again."" So, I'm thinking, hey, I guess Scarlett is going to stop whinning and bawling every damn second. And I figured Scarlett was going to be transformed into a likable character with her war experience to be her impetis to transformation.But NOOOoooo, that's not it at all! What we see is Scarlett continue to whine and cry at every instant, only it is now more calculated. Just designed to get try to get her every whim. The entire second half was just unwatchable. Frankly, I don't give a damn about this most lousy, overrated piece of garbage of all time."	1.0	Most overrated movie of all time	2002-09-15	80	17	63

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AXXX16NGKK3DU	P. Carrubba	"You read that right. The movie is broken into two parts. It goes to the intermission on Disc 1, then continues on Disc 2, so in the middle of the film, you have to change DVDs.Despite the picture's 4 hour running time, I still hate this aspect of the DVD presentation. I always thought breaking a film up ended when DVD replaced VHS.Neither the packaging nor the product overview here on Amazon states, ""Please note this feature is broken up over two DVDs."" And I need not explain that the reason for this is because many would-be buyers might take a pass on such a set if this disclaimer were in plain sight. Such a disclaimer would be a service to those of us who wish to avoid such DVD sets.I've seen other 2-disc DVDs proclaim proudly: ""Over 5 hours of special features!"" which tells me that the discs are holding about 8 hours of data on two discs.Warner Bros., is it too hard to make Disc 1 have the whole movie and Disc 2 the supplemental features? I didn't think it would be right to write a review of the film, because there are over 600 of those here.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Gone With The Wind is one of the most monumental films in movie history.  It was a blockbuster before the term was coined and it still ranks among the most popular films of all time.  The movie is a sweeping adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's novel about life in the Deep South before, during and after the Civil War.  Filmed in brilliant color, the movie explodes off the screen and is filled with unforgettable performances.  Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh create two of the most famous screen characters in Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara.  Rhett is a dashing rogue whose allegiance is not to the South, but to lining his own pockets.  Scarlett is the classic, self-absorbed Southern belle, who thinks that the world revolves around her.  In the early Hollywood days, black actors were regulated to nothing more than bit performers, but Hattie McDaniel rises above the stereotypical housemaid role of Mammy to deliver a powerful performance.  Olivia de Havilland has fragile beauty in role of the doomed Melaine and Leslie Howard is stodgy and proper as Scarlett's true love, Ashley Wilkes.  The film has been criticized, and rightly so in some places, for glorifying the slavery days of the South.  While the beginning of the film does deserve the criticism as it does promulgate stereotypes such as the character of Prissy and there are other sections that can be perceived as such, it is not a wholly sympathetic take on the South.  The film is notable for the fact that Hattie McDaniel became the first African-American actor to win an Academy Award as she took home the Best Supporting Actress Oscar (sadly it would take another twenty-four years before another African-American would win when Sidney Poitier in 1963 and another fifty-one years before an African-American woman would win when Whoopie Goldberg won in 1990).  Ms. Leigh won her first Best Actress Oscar and film dominated the 1939 Academy Awards winning a total of nine awards (one of was an honorary Oscar) including Best Picture and Best Director for Victor Fleming.	5.0	Civil War Epic and Hollywood Giant	2003-01-09	14	11	3

It even set a precedent of Margaret Mitchell (her maiden name) who was married to the President of Southern Company making more money that her husband for one year which caused his boss, Thomas Dewey to give him a raise to get him back ahead.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1N2N6R6NQHFTE	Publius	"I just watched GWTW for the umpteenth time.One thing that struck me this time was that the movie is presented from an ante-bellum Southerner's point of view.  That point of view has been largely marginalized in this country since the 1930s.We know how the Civil War and Reconstruction are viewed by the Black community, and we know how the Civil War and Reconstruction are viewed by the Northerners.  We also know how contemporary man portrays the Southerner's view of the Civil War and Reconstruction (i.e., uneducated racists).  What we never see anymore is how Southerners viewed themselves, their black slaves, and the Civil War.That portrayal of Southerners as kind, highly educated, and compassionate human beings -- regardless of its historical accuracy -- is like the Old South, gone with the wind.Anyone who attempted to create a movie from this type of pro-Southerner viewpoint today would be black-listed in Hollywood faster than you can say ""Joseph McCarthy."""	5.0	PC Police Missed This One	2006-08-30	10	6	4

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A5ZUZ49YRDPCV	Rachel Garret	"1939: Gone With The Wind swept the Oscars with more than 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It was a blockbuster then, with thousands of fans and audiences captivated by the monumental saga of the Civil War. It was a trend setting film, ahead of its time, and only later in the 50's would historic epics return (such as The Ten Commandments, Spartacus, Ben-Hur and Doctor Zhivago, which comes closer to the romantic and epic verisimilitude of GWTW)Gone With The Wind takes its place among cinema's masterpieces. On DVD, the experience is sensational and worth the price. This limited edition comes equipped with photographs and a wealth of information on the making of the film. It's a dream.Gone With The Wind was Margaret Mitchell's only novel. Thank God it was a masterpiece and considered by many to be the ""Great American novel"". From the best-selling book came the idea for the movie. Director David O. Selznick would die being honored for this film (eventhough he tried to be more than just the Gone With The Wind director with the later film ""Duel In The Sun""). On his tomb is written, ""Here lies David O. Selznick, the man who directed Gone With The Wind."" Because the film was unlike any other before its time, it instantly made Selznick a Hollywood legend, eventhough it was a one-time event for him. This can be said of James Cameron, who directed Titanic, also likened to Gone With The Wind.30's sex symbol Clark Gable portrayed Rhett Bulter, the wealthy maverick who attempted to win the heart of the seemingly untamable Scarlett O'Hara (played by the beautiful Vivien Leigh in her debut cinematic role). Scarlett is a strong and courageous Southern belle, whose only goal in life was to have the man of her dreams- Ashley Wilkes (played by the British actor Leslie Howard). But tragically for Scarlett, things never got to be the way she wanted them. The dignified Ashley married the meek, sensitive Victorian lady Melanie Hamilton.Throughout the lush, dramatic film, which covers the Civil War and the Reconstruction, Scarlett endures hardships, war, death and loss (she loses her mother and father). When Tara, her plantation home is threatened, Scarlett's heroic nature emerges. She will do anything to protect and preserve Tara. She goes as far as to marry men she did not love - Frank Kennedy, her own sister's boyfriend. Although Scarlett is willful, vibrant, lusty and strong, and many would argue incredibly selfish, she has the side to her that remains true to her better nature- that of her love for family and home. She even does good to Melanie Hamilton, her own rival sort to speak. Scarlett is a complex, anti-heroine whom we all want to be like. She could survive anything and she was herself, perhaps unconsciously to the viewers in 1939 and afterward, a symbol of hope, figurative resurrection and survival in America. America was going through the Great Depression and World War 2 was just around the corner.The film has a romantic, sweeping soundtrack by the composer Max Steiner. ""Tara's theme"" is unforgettable and nostalgic. Although straying far from the novel in many aspects, the film has its great moments. The most memorable are Scarlett at the barbecue flirting with every man in a gorgeous green gown and yellow hat, the fire as Atlanta burns and falls to the Yankees, Scarlett's great vow ""I will never be hungry again!"" as the sun sets across her plantation, the dead soldiers by the thousands and of course, the finale in which Clark Gable, disenchanted and resigned, understands that Scarlett did not love him and would not give him a chance, decides to abandon the marriage. ""But, Rhett, what shall I do ? Where shall I go ?"" Scarlett asks in tears. ""Frankly, my dear,"" replies Rhett, ""I don't give a damn."" During this time, the censors must have had a field day.Above all, the theme of Gone With The Wind, is that of hope. Scarlett's real love was never Ashley, nor Rhett Butler, but her home in Tara. With courage and with renewed strength, we know that Scarlett will eventually win Rhett back. The novel said of her ""There was nothing she could not do or have if she put her mind to it."" She says proudly, ""After all, tomorrow is another day."""	5.0	A Masterpiece Of Cinema, Fans Will Be Thrilled	2003-04-21	2	1	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1SVXJZ3386U2D	Randy Keehn	I had heard a lot ab out GWTW before I ever had a chance to see it.  When I was young, there was still a ban on showing GWTW on TV.  That wasn't a ban that the TV stations imposed, it was a ban imposed by the movie's producers.  I can imagine their feeling that TV was beneath the dignity of this movie.  Frankly my dear, I think they were right.  Thus even though it was in the 1960's, I saw GWTW in a movie theater (it made the rounds every so often and not because it was digitally remastered).  This is one of the greatest movies of all time and arguably the best epic of all times.  It has everything, directing, acting, script, cineamatography, sound, music, you name it.  I used to listen to the soundtrack periodically and even it would give me goosebumps.It is a movie about the South; before, during, and after the Civil War.  There have been many detractors about the misrepresentation of this theme, especially of its' portaryal of Blacks (a number of slaves portrayed seemed quite content with their lot).  Nonetheless, it was a record-breaking picture in that the first Black thespian to receive an Oscar was Hattie McDaniel in her outstanding role as &quot;Mammy&quot;.  This was in 1939 after all, the tone of the movie was to be expected; the awarding of the Oscar was not.  In this day and age of everything needing to be politically correct, we loose sight of the fact that some art forms prefer to show a perspective rather than the &quot;agreed upon&quot; correct version.  As a Yankee through and through, I take no umbrage at our portrayal in this movie.  I realize that this is easier for me to say than for some groups.  However, we are talking about a work of fiction.The acting, as mentioned is terrific and many of the stars of the day were in the cast.  Clark Gable was certainly the &quot;Joe Cool&quot; of his day.  Vivian Leigh was outstanding as well in her coveted role as Scarlett O'Hara.  The supporting cast was long and able.  The scenes of Atlanta during the Civil War were gripping and technologically innovative in its' time.While the subject was the South, the theme was romance and the electricity between Gable and Leigh was definitely high voltage.  There were many scenes of great sadness in this movie and the audience seems even more involved in what happens than in most any other movie I can think of.  We are all uncomfortable with the ending yet none of us wanted a sequel.  We simply were left believing that Scarlett had the strength to eventually prevail.If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing not just an excellent movie but one of the classics of American Cinema.  Yes, it's long but it really doesn't seem so (and you'll have wanted it extended another 10-15 minutes to get the ending you wanted to see).  The younger kids might fall asleep and the teenagers will claim that it's corny, but this really is a family movie.  Maybe this is one you want to watch with your parents instead.	5.0	Waht an Epic!	2003-12-29	6	5	1
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3SARNBM5U4A20	RAUL DASILVA	"It took many years, six, I believe, for Margaret Mitchell to complete the writing of her Pulitzer Prize winning book upon which the feature film is based.  The novel shows it, and it was still being written with major changes, for example, in its title and the name of its leading protagonist from Pansy to Scarlett even while its publisher, Macmillan, was preparing it for print.The film also took years in development, including the great struggle to locate exacting matches for its characters and then the application of some of the finest crafts men and women in what might have been the peak year of Hollywood's Golden Age.  The film shows that as well.  It should be included in all curricula on filmmaking and in long form writing.  It is a finely etched, beautifully considered character study.  As such it is a triumph in American literature in both novel and film forms.  Like all finely accomplished works of the human heart it has become timeless.Beyond all of that we are left with a depiction of artistry in both literature and movie making when as in other forms, such as architecture, love was part if the gestalt of creation and profit at bottom line accounting and the marketplace were not the major compelling issues.  Here, we have an example of serendipity and timing of arts at a moment in our history when it was possible to create the enduring classic that this is.  ""Gone with the Wind"" might also describe the possibility of such a moment."	5.0	A Triumph!	2003-05-23	1	1	0

One can also view the film with commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer, offering interesting side-notes on cast, characters, production, and music.The included documentaries on both Leigh and Gable are matched by the shorter, but no less effective, ""looks"" at Hattie McDaniel, Butterfly McQueen, Thomas Mitchell, Eddie Anderson, as well as the other actors and actresses in supporting but still memorable roles.The only missing ""profile"" is of longstanding performers Ward Bond (a ""Yankee"" officer) and Victor Jory (the foreman at Tara).

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A14SDWVTTW6T34	Republichick	"This movie is not a racist movie like some ignorant , uninformed people have claimed.  You cannot compare things that happened many years ago to present time. People did use words like the ""N"" word and terms like darkies to describe black people. Even black people referred to themselves by those words. The movie is an acurate portrayl of blacks at that time. Blacks were uneducated. They were held down by whites because of slavery. It's not right , but it did happen. You cannot erase the past. We shouldn't pretend like it didn't happen. It did happen and we should never forget it or else we're doomed to repeat it. There is a famous quote along those lines. Slavery existed everywhere. It was not only in the south. The south had more slaves because they had huge plantations. They had slaves in the north. They didn't need as many slaves because they didn't have the plantations. Abraham Lincoln had slaves. He even had children with slaves. That comment goes out to the person who acts like Lincoln was some kind of hero. The north was wrong. The civil war was about states rights. It was not about abolishing slavery. The north did not want the states to have the right to decide whether or not they would allow slavery. The south felt it was up to the states to decide. The north was not trying to end slavery. In a way, the north were terrorists. They invaded a terrority with sole purpose to take over and destroy a region and force them to adapt to their way of life. The movie isn't really even about those things. It's just a love story that happens to take place in the south during the civil war. It's also a story about survival. It's a coming of age story of a spoiled young woman.  It's about her love for her home. I think Scarlett is an admirable woman. She went from being an immature, self centered brat to a strong woman capable of doing anything to take care of herself and her loved ones. This movie desires the title of a classic. It's a must see for intelligent, open minded people."	5.0	best movie of all time	2004-12-25	16	7	9

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1AIJX4W864HIY	"""rhettbutler2"""	Now don't get me wrong, Citizen Kane is not a good movie, it is a great one.  But there is NO comparison to Gone With The Wind.  The story aside, the cinematography is still the best to date of any film I have ever seen.  The color's are so vibrant you think you are going to fall right into the scene.  Now, couple that with a story that gives you some of the greatest characters to ever be put to film.  I could put pages down just on the characters alone.  Vivien Leigh protrays Scarlet with just the right balance of selfish, self centeredness and humanity.  Scarlet is the type of character you are supposed to dislike strongly, but you find yourself enamored with her all the same.  Much the same can be said of Clark Gable's Rhett.  A womanizing so called gentleman, hell bent on self preservation above all else.  Yet at the same time, he becomes deeply devoted to Scarlet and Bonnie, wanting only to spoil them rotten.  These are the things that give these characters life, making them all the more real for their faults.  I won't bog you down with a plot summary since they are readily available to the poor souls who haven't seen the film.  The story does bring all your emotions come into play.  There are sad times and happy.  There are funny moments and somber.  All against the back drop of the Civil War (or as we like to call it in the South:  &quot;The War of Northern Aggression&quot; haha).  Also, the best shot, directed and produced film of all time in my opinion.  After you see this film, it will likely be the movie you judge all others by.  Pick up a copy today, after all, &quot;Tomorrow's another day&quot;.	5.0	Forget Citizen Kane, for my money GWTW is #1	2000-11-08	7	3	4

And I recall the still palpable nostalgia by whites for the antebellum South complete with plantations and slaves. In my town in small-town NC the black folks were literally on the other side of the tracks in &#34;Jim Town.&#34; When I first saw GWTW as a child (it would be re-released in the South every few years to packed movie houses) it definitely left me with the historical revisionist view reenforced by my school teachers (who taught that the Civil War was not really about slavery...) that the South of Scarlet O'Hara really existed. As I grew up and was exposed to the historical narrative as it realistically described the South by serious historians, I realize now after seeing GWTW this time that always served as a starting place for my building an understanding of what the South is all about today. If you are a southerner you may know what I mean. This is a film everyone should see. High school history classes should teach this film. And beyond its importance as an educational experience the acting, effects, sets, photography, the whole movie package is superb, it is thoroughly entertaining - still a masterpiece after now 75 years.	5.0	The Old South that Never Existed	2014-01-07	2	2	0

Today, they were able not only to realign the frames of the red-gren-blue elements, but to actually divide each frame in small sections and realign them individually. This was never possible before.The result is an overall crispy detailed picture with beautiful colors.The bonus material is abundant and covers pre-production to release of the movie, restoration, and even what seems to be a television movie about the casting for the role of Scarlett, starring Tony Curtis as David O. Selznick.The beautiful box with velvet finishing and golden letters is  one of the items that make this gift set be even most interesting for collection.Includes a hard cover book, a reprint of the original release promotional booklet, cards, many of the infamous Selznick's memos. Also includes a CD with excerpts of the musical score.Do you like this film?Then BUY THIS.	5.0	A Collector's Must Have	2011-03-02	1	1	0

Max Steiner has ALWAYS been my favorite movie music composer.  He has a certain talent for creating theme music for each character in a film. His talents are extremely missed in the films that are made today. The director, screenplay, and most of all the brilliant cast is something that will never be seen again. This was an era that is now &quot;Gone With The Wind.&quot;The DVD version is excellent. I remember seeing this film in several different formats but this DVD version remindes me of the 70mm reissue back in the early 70's which was pain-stakingly restored.  If you don't have this version, get it.

Nothing new can be said about the leading and supporting actors, the sets and scenery, the creative use of color, and the special effects (see Atlanta burn!).  So as a professional historian let me add that the movie and -- I hope the novel, which I have not read -- represents Yankees and Southerners fairly and fully.  The fact that two blacks, Mammy and Sam, are far more virtuous than the two principals, Scarlett and Rhett, challenges any notion that the film is racist.	5.0	A late convert	2013-07-27	1	0	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	Gone with the Wind (Victor Fleming, 1939)I have hated Gone with the Wind for decades based on little snatches of it that I've seen here and there over a long period of time. I thought that, perhaps, I might be giving it short shrift, so a few nights ago, I sat down to watch the entire four-hour extravaganza from beginning to end. It somehow doesn't surprise me that I now hate the film in an entirely new, more passionate, more comprehensive way than I did previously.My main bone of contention is not that the film is far, far too long for the skimpy subject matter it explores-- an hour and a half running time might have helped immensely-- but that Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, in the final ninety minutes of the film, break the cardinal rule-- they manage to screw everything up by simply not talking. These are incredibly stupid, shallow people. Why have generations wasted four hours on this twaddle? And why do some do it every year? I've heard many people refer to it as a great romance; maybe this is a good portion of what's wrong with America today. If this is your idea of a great romance, folks, then perhaps you need to go back to the well and think a little more about what constitutes a great romance. I'm pretty sure that philandering, jealousy, all the character depth of a piece of onionskin, and a decided lack of intelligence should not be contributing factors.While the visual spectacle of the thing is inarguable, everything else about it-- the pace, the characterization, the script, all of it-- are just plain awful. And the romance? There is none. *	1.0	Yep, that's four hours of my life gone with the wind, all right.	2008-05-30	56	11	45

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	I remember seeing this as a child, perhaps 45 years ago.  It embedded itself in my imagination and nurtured a fascination with history that has survived in me to this day.  I wanted to get it for my kids, who are Europeans (by residence and character) quite distanced from American history.  So a viewing would introduce them to many notions, I hoped, and questions that they would want to answer for themselves.  Happily, it did and was also fun to watch for all of us.This film evokes a historical period with the beauty of a laser:  the old south was about to vanish in an ill-advised war of attrition with the industrial North.  Against this backdrop, you get a dazling array of characters, from Scarlett to Melly.  They are complex characters complete with flaws and hidden agendas that are often not spelled out.  I was happy to observe that, although there are some stereotypes and unquestioned assumptions, the depth is largely intact in spite of the age of the film.  This in my view justifies its status as one of the indisputed true hollywood classics.  That being said, it did have some melodramatic twists that clearly dated the film, but its emotions remained indisputably hot and relevant.REcommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  We will watch this many more times, as a family, with all the challenges of lively interpretation.	5.0	psychological portrait of a key historical period	2010-05-30	0	0	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"I have probably seen all or part of this film on more than a dozen occasions but not for several years until I recently checked it out in DVD format. The production values have never looked more vivid. The scope of the story and the scale of telling it are truly epic. The performances by Clark Gable and Leslie Howard are as impressive as ever. A number of supporting actors are first-rate. A number of scenes have retained their visual impact. And yet....I now think this highly praised film (ranked #4 by the American Film Institute among ""America's Greatest Movies"") has lost much of its impact.For whatever reasons, the acting by Vivian Leigh and Olivia de Havilland now seems to me contrived. Rhett Butler's devotion to Scarlett is inexplicable. De Havilland's portrayal suggests that Melanie Hamilton is too good to be true, and therefore isn't. Thomas (""Burning Ham"") Mitchell portrays Gerald O'Hara as a cartoon character. When Sidney Howard's screenplay shifts its attention to social issues, I suspect that his muse was Harriet Beecher Stowe. To an extent I did not realize before, this film glorifies (almost deifies) a way of life which justified slavery as a state's right (i.e. the ruling class's right). Even benevolent despotism is still despotism.On the subject of entitlement, producer David O'Selznick and director Victor Fleming obviously had every right to create a film based on Margaret Mitchell's bloated and sentimental novel. If they wish to suggest in this film that to many slaves, loyalty to their owners was more important freedom from bondage, so be it. Their movie. However, as Voltaire observed, great is the enemy of the good...and, I presume to add, an even more formidable enemy of the mediocre. Gone With the Wind offers great spectacle and a few brilliant performances as well as several credible performances and an occasional chuckle. But overall, it is emphatically not the great film I once thought it was. The film hasn't changed so obviously I have.Some may think it unfair to be critical of a film released more than 60 years ago. I respectfully submit that many films released since then have raised the standards of measurement. They have redefined what greatness is. (Most of them are on the AFI's list.) Perhaps it's unrealistic to expect an historical film lasting almost four hours (222 minutes to be exact) to hold up. Audiences which first saw it in 1939 are obviously quite different from those which see it now. Nonetheless, our nation fought one war to obtain certain inalienable rights and another was fought to ensure that the same rights are extended to everyone in our nation. Any film which claims to portray American history must be subject to the same scrutiny which a book would be if making the same claim. As for matters of aesthetics, judgment is necessarily much more subjective. For reasons indicated, I think that Gone With the Wind offers neither circumspect history nor great art but will always be praised (and rightly) so as spectacular entertainment."	5.0	Spectacular Entertainment	2003-07-10	13	7	6
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AGZVS6M8XJGN6	"Roberto Frangie ""Robert"""	"Victor Fleming ended up directing two of the most entertaining films ever made: ""Gone with the Wind,"" and ""The Wizard of Oz.""""Gone with the Wind"" is a masterpiece of mass entertainment, a world apart from ""Children of Paradise."" Here, the period is conceived in luxuriant and romantic terms, calculated to serve the intentions of escapism... The picture is set in the most turbulent and romantic era of American history, the years during and after the Civil War, providing the viewer with a big epic world of fantasy...But the true key to the film's success is the adventures of one character named Scarlett O'Hara whose actions, motives, emotions, joys and pains make her the perfect element for a rich romantic film... Her obsession to rebuild her plantation Tara, to ""never to be hungry again"", to re-create the splendor and romance of a ""land of cavaliers and cotton fields in the Old South,"" is figured out to stimulate the audience with her many faces...From the opening scene with the 16 year-old beauty on the steps of Tara through war, marriage, poverty, reconstruction, birth, death, attempted rape, miscarriage and lost love, until the final image of the tear-stained face of the 28 year-old Scarlett, who refuses to recognize defeat in Rhett's rejection of her, promising to return to Tara and to ""think of some way to get him back,"" Vivien Leigh is magnificent... She carries the picture, and dominates it... She reproduces the character of Scarlett in all its eloquence complexity...Clark Gable is fascinating... He is the perfect of the American male movie star to play the gambler and lady-killer... The motion picture marks the climax of his career as a sex symbol... The dramatic high point of Clark Gable's performance in the film is the scene of Rhett Butler crying in Melanie's presence over Scarlett near death from her miscarriage...The love scenes between Scarlett and Rhett give the picture a vibrancy that is one of its main attractions... The film begins with their first stormy meeting in the library at Twelve Oaks and intensifies at the Atlanta bazaar, when Rhett shocks the confederacy by bidding $l00 ""in gold,"" to dance with the newly widowed Mrs. Hamilton, and Scarlett scandalizes the town by accepting...The richest characterization of the entire film is given by Hattie McDaniel as Mammy, the sly only person, besides Rhett Butler, who is never fooled by Scarlett's airs and tears...Butterfly McQueen portrays Scarlett's shrill servant girl, Prissy...Thomas Mitchell plays Gerald O'Hara, master of Tara and father of Scarlett... He teaches his daughter that ""Land is the only thing that lasts.""Ona Munson plays Belle Watling, the leading madam of Atlanta's red-light district... Belle's scenes are brief but effective, and, for the time, quite frank in letting the audience know that she is Rhett's mistress... Munson's finest moment was her scene with Melanie...""Gone with the Wind"" is good cinema. We see very little in the way of important scenes but definitely much less than in Griffith's ""Intolerance,"" and yet we feel as we have seen a lot: The shot of Scarlett and her father looking out over the fields of Tara; Scarlett's search for Dr. Meade 'climbing' over piles of rubbles under the top of a ruined building; Atlanta on fire; bleeding twilights; and the swirling montage of Sherman's troops marching through Georgia...""Gone with the Wind"" contains no battles, but it gives an impression, quite strong, of the Civil War by its one really grand scene, the thousands of wounded lying about the Atlanta railroad station...The idealization of the Old South is beautifully described: the shot of the Mississippi riverboat; the barbecue at Twelve Oaks; the Atlanta bazaar; the Confederate battle flag waving bravely over a small remaining part of the Army in the last, gray days of the 'Lost Cause.'""Gone with the Wind"" is different with the outstanding achievement in the use of color: The O'Hara family at evening prayer; Rhett's farewell to Scarlett on the McDonough Road; the green teapot, symbol of gossipy; the delicate dawn scene of Scarlett and her father at Tara, when she discovers her father has lost his mind; and when Rhett proposes to Scarlett in Aunt Pity-pat's parlor as the late-afternoon sun spreads the room with a golden autumnal light...With a memorable music score by Max Steiner, ""Gone With the Wind"" is an instant classic, winner of eight Academy Awards..."	5.0	"""Gone with the Wind"" is good cinema!"	2007-01-01	9	8	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3H9JSM1SUTE4O	Robin Simmons	"GONE WITH THE WIND Four Disc Collector's Edition (Warner) is the third digital edition of this iconic 1939 film that remains one of the best novel to screen adaptations and among the most popular  movies of all time.  Though not really a great film, this beloved melodrama looks and sounds better than ever and is loaded with watchable extras.What distinguishes this version from the previous DVDs is the glorious Ultra-Resolution process that sharpens the image and clarifies the colors.  The result is breathtaking.  The sound has also been remixed in satisfying 5.1 Dolby Surround for maximum effect.  I can't imagine what else can be done to this film to improve it (or a way for it to be released on DVD again except in High Definition format.)In addition to the new look, three additional discs are packed with watchable extras. Besides the new to DVD two hour ""Making of a Legend,"" I especially liked the documentary profile of Clark Gable and a look at the short troubled life of Vivian Leigh.

However, it's the performance of Vivien Leigh that makes it great. In a musical piano concerto it doesn't matter how good the orchestra is its the ability of the pianist that determines the greatness of the performanceThis is how I think of the Vivien Leigh movies. They're film concertos with Vivian Leigh as the brilliant soloist. In GWTW, Lady Hamilton and Waterloo Bridge it's her wonderful acting that makes these extra ordinary films.  I believe that these 3 movies would have fallen into obscurity had any other actress played the leading role.The blue ray version of GWTW is extremely good considering the original prints are 70 years old. Very entertaining and worth the money. But as I said before the tempo of the film revolves around Vivien Leigh's persona and brilliant acting.	5.0	Soloist	2010-04-12	6	4	2

Most cinemas might not have had Screens for the Cinemascope-format, but the US-Laserdisc version that I baught a long time ago in NY had the (apparently) only Letterboxed (Cinemascope) Version ever available. I never had the time watch the whole thing, but I remember, that the title ""GONE WITH THE WIND"" rolled in Cinemascope from right to left through the screen. Of course it had thick black bars to fit into a 4:3 tv-set. Since I can't find it in the loft right now I can't even tell if it was done in CLV or CAV-format and how many discs it had, but it was a must-have-collector's item version.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2RH7ARWQSUVQV	"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God"""	"""Gone with the Wind"" is a fabulous film, the film by which all others are gauged.  It debuted in 1939, perhaps the year that produced the most high quality films of all time.  Watching this film is like viewing a great painting.  Every time I watch it I get something new.  I also detect subtleties and insights I never recognized when I was younger.I won't attempt to summarize this well-known film, because I see that there have been over seven hundred reviews before this one.  I will tell you about a personal experience that some reviewers might find interesting.Many years ago when I was a medical student, I spent three months as an observer on a psychiatric ward containing patients with mixed diagnoses.  One of the patients was an inconspicuous old lady diagnosed as a catatonic.  She simply rocked in her rocking chair and stared at the floor.  She was totally unresponsive.  A psychiatrist asked me if I'd like to look at her history...and...what a history it was.  There was a scrap book with letters, press clippings and newspaper photographs.It turns out, as a young [and quite beautiful] woman she was a Georgia debutante.  The letters were from...well... a director with the initials DOS.  The earliest letters were enthusiastic saying that she was a shoo-in for the part of Scarlett Ohara.  Then the letters grew more tentative stating that she must realize that she had serious competition from Bette Davis, Kate Hepburn and Vivian Leigh.  The letters grew increasingly pessimistic and finally rejected her altogether.  Reportedly, this little old lady's decline started the same day.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God"" on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"	5.0	Ecstacy and Agony	2008-09-19	1	1	0

Alas cold Scarlett has befreinded Ashley's wife but she'll see the day that  she dies so that Scarlett can get Ashley for herself.But who do we have  hear we have the gentelman of an oak Red.We see that Red matches and  handles Scarlett as well as she handls herself.Oh we forgot about the war  while a town is bombed all Scarlett can think of is getting to Tara and  Ashley.When she get's to Tara she learns that it's almost a pile of  rubble.The only thing keeping Tara alive were the slaves.This is  when Scarlett begins to sink to a low desperately seeking a job Scarlett  finds a mill , oh but where does she get the money when she never had  any.You always know in this movie the woman was so beautiful and so much of  a con job that she could get anybody to give her money.Alas when  poor old ashley comes back he can't give her anything so where does she go,  good old red who even up the ante and tells her that he will marry her and  make Tara beautiful again no matter how much the cost.They have wonderful  marrige just the way she likes it  money Scarlett and Red have a beautiful  daughter.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	David Selznick's Civil War blockbuster justifiably earned the &quot;classic&quot; that usually precedes any review of it.  This movie shows off its considerable budget, imagination and wealth of detail in  virtually every frame, and to top it all off, features an electrifying  ensemble of superb performers, all of whom chew into their roles with  relish.  What continues to surprise me about this movie is its freshness --  it never dates. The sexual tension that exists in every frame between  Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable feels every bit -- if not more so -- as sparky  and enjoyable today as it ever was.  The Margaret Mitchell story is  whittled down, eliminating some extraneous characters (some of Scarlett's  children for starters), but the streamlining does nothing but improve upon  the essentials of this big, sprawling epic, which manages to be both  intimate and satisfying as a melodrama of the highest order, and also as a  quaint, if skewed, look back at the most vicious battle ever fought on our  soil.  The production values continue to have your eyes popping out of your  head -- costumes, sets, sunsets -- all that COLOR drenches every inch of  the screen.  And the Max Steiner score still engenders goosebumps with  every viewing.  Vivien Leigh is so -- so -- SCARLETT it is impossible not  to envision her perfectly beautiful arched eyebrows whenever you hear the  name Scarlett O'Hara.  And the ending is one of the best in Hollywood  history -- it caps off the whole saga with humanity and more than a hint of  suspense.  Perfect.	5.0	MASTERPIECE	2000-01-04	6	5	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3AKPY4LXIC24O	Ryan Costantino	This is historical drama at its best.  I am 20 years old and have tiptoed around watching this movie for some time because I am no fan of romantic comedies or romantic dramas.  I have thought for years that Gone With The  Wind was that type of movie, but bottom line this is one of the best movies  ever produced in Hollywood.  Which says something about Hollywood since  this movie is over 60 years old!  Set in Georgia before and during the  civil war and centered around a spitfire young aristocrat named Scarlett  (Vivian Leigh)who is disgruntled over the prospect of being ordinary, only  to find adventure and intrigue through a well to do visitor named Rhett  (Clark Gable).  Scarlett becomes infatuated, but for her own misguided  reasons.  If I had known that this movie was so exciting, so beautiful  (it's hard to believe when watching this that it is so old, but then again  I did see the restored version).  Every character is acted superbly  (especially Hattie Mcdaniel who earned an Academy Award for her performance  as Mammy, and I believe she is the first African-American to hold that  honor).  This movie held the record for most Academy Awards until some  stupid boat movie came along and in my opinion this movie should still  retain that standing).  Gone With The Wind is one of the best movies ever,  a classic not to be missed.  So just remember its not a mushy love story  guys!  The only part I didn't like was the last line spoken by Scarlett, it  should have ended with the word &quot;damn&quot; and the closing of a door.  But that's Hollywood and its happy resolutions for you.  You haven't seen  a good movie until you can compare it to this.	5.0	Great Drama Deceptively Dubbed a Romance, Awesome!	2000-04-28	4	3	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ARBEB1MDN135C	"Ryff Wolf ""tomovieboy70"""	An erroneous response to a reviewer must be corrected.  The reviewer was wondering why there is no widescreen version of GWTW.  Correctly, the 2nd reviewer responded that until around 1952, there were few, very rare, films released in aspect ratios of greater than 1.33:1.  GWTW was created in 1939, long before Cinerama, CinemaScope, Todd-AO, Panavision, VistaVision were invented.  HOWEVER, Metro Goldwyn Mayer decided in 1967 that to cash in on the great, disasterous trend toward roadshow films (those with reserved seats, intermission, overture, etc.), they would take GWTW and crop it to fit 70mm. film for widescreen projection.  Metro had done a conversion of this title in the late 1950s which stretched the image, but DID have a carefully created stereo soundtrack.  The 1967 70mm. version (with a 2:1 aspect ratio) had a six-track soundtrack created by splitting the sound indiscriminately into six channels and so, there was amplified background noise instead of careful separation.  The 70mm. edition, cropped and blown up though it might have been, was a huge hit, both as a roadshow and a general release.  GWTW has always seemed like a natural for widescreen exhibition, but it simply was NOT shot that way.  However, due must be paid to MGM for both of their attempts to create a widescreen version, although neither of these attempts has ever been released on any format of home video.	5.0	Clearing Up the Widescreen Question	2014-07-01	1	1	0

They really made Rhett and Scarlett the icons that they are today.  The best performance I would have to say in the whole film is Hattie McDaniel's role as Mammie.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2M4KJ6B8LDNK5	Sable	"For a story that was a rocky film-in-the-making from the start, the rewards are endless and breathtaking. Never has a novel and a film caused such a stir in people's hearts and minds for such a long period of time. 1939 was ""Gone With The Wind's Year"", but I feel it was mine too. I mean, I own a part of that history, and many others in the world of Scarlett and Rhett's ring of restless desires. What charcaters! What a part of cinema to own! ""Gone With The Wind"" can stir a hopeless romantic's heart, a bubbling broot of a man, or a lover of war history, and superb film scores. I even own the soundtrack. And I am not out of high school yet. Very few films can grab credit for embracing a novel with accomplishment, 10 academy awards, and the trademark of a classic. If you are a film lover, or just beginning, nothing could thrill you or educate you more on the shelves of the silver screen classics than MGM's masterpiece of GONE WITH THE WIND>>>>>>>"	5.0	As God Is My Witness, I Have Never Eyed A Better Masterpiece	2004-04-21	3	3	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A37S3ACL57LN62	"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra"""	"This movie is a historical film on many levels. It excellently portrays the old south, a civilization ""gone with the wind."" It seemlessly adapts the rather long Margaret Mitchell best seller onto the screen. It won a historic eight Oscars including the first to a black actor (Hattie McDaniel). And aside from all of these things, it is a highly entertaining film.For those who are unfamiliar with the story, I just recommend seeing the film. It has a little bit of everything, though it is certainly heavy on the sentiment. It is, after all, an homage to the glory of the old south. Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a rather flirtatious girl who finds herself insanely jealous when she finds out that Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) is to marry his cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Suddenly, the south enters a war with the north and the world becomes chaotic. A scoundrel from Charleston named Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) is a constant companion to Scarlett though she treats him badly. It is obvious that he loves her, but she is too enraptured with Ashley. Battling poverty and responsibility when she aches for the life of luxury she led before the war, Scarlett strives for happiness when everyone else has lost their strength.There are many gorgeous scenes in the movie; each scene stands out as a work of art. Who could forget the simplicity of the women strolling down the grand staircase at the Wilkes' barbeque? Or what about Eric Linden's heartwrenching screams as he fights to keep his leg? What a powerful statement the field of wounded and dying soldiers makes as the torn Confederate flag weakly waves in the breeze! And who is not jarred by the impact of the red sky against the hopelessness of the war torn fields of Georgia? Scene after scene cements itself into the unconscious and becomes more powerful with each viewing.There are many interesting behind-the-scenes stories to be told about the film, many of which are included in the 1989 documentary included on disk three. Most interesting about this piece is perhaps the audition footage with some of the top names in Hollywood. Also on this disk are features about the restoration of the film and footage of the premieres.Disk four is essential for fans of the stars of the golden age of Hollywood. We see a recently recorded bit with de Havilland where she relays memories of the making of Gone With the Wind. It is always interesting to hear firsthand information. The Gable documentary is not wonderful, but it does include memories from a longtime friend. Leigh's tribute is a bit better, and includes many clips arranged artistically for an emotional impact."	5.0	A True Masterpiece	2007-03-10	9	7	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2EQ74NIFWYEGC	Sarah Brownlow	Needless to say, GWTW is a classic and one of the most highly reverred and famous movies of our time. This for many reasons-- the cast, the scenery, the story itself-- one of the tradegy of war, the quest for finding your  true love, friendship, betrayl, and lots of Southern charm. Even though  GWTW was made in 1939, it is still relevant and a story that is timeless;  that's probably the reason for its longevity.  The performances were also  very impressive and at the height of their time. Vivien Leigh, an actress  from England who was practically obscure, won the coveted role and played a  belle from Georgia with incredible flair and talent. Clark Gable and Olivia  de Havilland and Leslie Howard round out my favorite foursome of classic  Hollywood actors, who helped make this film the triumph it was.  GWTW is a  movie phenomenon. It was and still is a masterpiece that has not been met  and can't be touched. I highly recommend it to any one and everyone who  wants to be dazzled and have their emotions tested.	5.0	Easily and still the best movie ever made	2000-07-06	6	4	2

I have fond memories of my mother calling me Scarlett as she tucked me in for bed in my faux-fur collared cardigan sweater, as I responded with a ""Goodnight Mammy."" I love Gone with the Wind because of it's cutting-edge special effects. I love the actors and how they made you feel a part of the experience. I love that it was the first feature film made in Technicolor. I love all of the well-known history of the movie. This movie has been criticized for glamourizing slavery. It's been criticized for romanticizing war times. But what I don't think these people realize is that it is a movie. It was meant to entertain. Movies of that era were about love or war. Gone with the Wind combined them into one spectacularly mesmerizing experience of loss, survival and re-birth. It won the Best Picture Oscar for good reason. It will forever continue it's place on my list as my number one favorite movie of all time."	5.0	Gone with the Wind - Best Movie of all Time	2011-02-14	5	1	4
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A14IZOB6KBTUFE	Scarlett	To the October 21st reviewer:  A lot of the backgrounds were hand painted by Jack Cosgrove.  They didn't have computer animation in 1939, and a lot of the sets were not built whole, so Jack painted the rest in.  For example, all of the sunset shots at Tara, those are hand painted, and the entire outside of Twelve Oaks was painted.  They filmed that shot in front of a warehouse on the Selznick lot, and then Cosgrove painted it in for the film and that's why it looks like everyone is going inside Twelve Oaks at the bar-b-que.My review:I just finished reading the book for the third time...I still can't get over it, it's so good.  The movie I've see countless times and i never get tired of it.  What a great story on all levels!  It follows the book closely, and the characters stepped right off the page and onto the screen.  Gable and leigh are electrifying--you can practically see the electricity when he winds her up and watches her snap!  Scarlett and Rhett are two of the greatest characters in literary and screen history.  There's a reason why this movie remains popular even after 65 years...the themes are universal, the story is brilliant, and the characters are unforgettable.Even if you don't like Scarlett for all her selfish and egocentric ways, you still care about her for all she went through.  Rhett, oh Rhett, what can I say?  He's my favorite.  What a man, and yet, underneath it all, he's vulnerable too.  Melanie and Ashley, they're great supporting characters, all 4 interwoven into this tapestry of love, war, honor, and the fall of a civilization.If you are afraid to watch it because it's too old or too long, trust me, I used to feel the same way, but try reading the book (don't be intimidated by the length, you'd with it was longer at the end), and just try watching the movie, it's great!!	5.0	Unsurpassed	2004-10-23	26	21	5
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A27NTH2Y9DAR31	Schuyler V. Johnson	Having watched GWTW countless times over the years, I always enjoyed it just as much as the first dozen times I saw it; it never gets boring or tired, it's always fascinating. It is brilliant filmmaking with great direction beautiful locations and exquisite clothes and fine acting. I had never seen Vivien Leigh before and was amazed at the quality of her acting. At the premiere in Atlanta, Olivier, (who was in Hollywood filming Wuthering Heights) was blown away by Leigh's acting ability; apparently he had had no idea of her mastery of her craft and it astonished him. Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar for her performance thus opening the door for all who followed in her footsteps and gave her a reward which she so richly deserved. Gable was bitterly disappointed when he lost the award to Robert Donat for Mr. Chips. I loved Olivia De Havilland's performance, I thought she was fabulous. I would go anywhere the movie was playing to see it; this was decades before DVD and once we went a tremendous distance to a drive in to see GWTW and stayed for TWO showings! We were wiped out when we got home. So to OWN this classic for less than 10.00 is amazing.	5.0	One of the best movies ever made, no argument	2013-04-14	3	2	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3BSS2M2DPPV4T	"""scotsladdie"""	"Great Balls of Fire! Books, reams and such have been written about this greatly beloved film - so I'll take a stab at it to! First off, a little trivia: Scarlett was originally going to be named Pansy. (yeah. right.) TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY was the original working title of the novel. GONE WITH THE WIND comes from the poem NOM SUM QUALIS ERAM by the 18th century poet Ernest Dawson i.e.: ""I have been faithful to thee Cynara in my fashion. I have forgot much, Cynara! Gone with the wind!"". Most everyone knows that this ultra famous picture concerns a beautiful, - in this version anyway - willful, egotistically headstrong daughter of a wealthy plantation owner who uses her cunning charms - with varying degrees of success - to get what she wants during the American Civil War of 1861-1865. In the role of Scarlett, Vivien Leigh is magnificent. She conveys all the intricate qualities of this selfish, charming & fascinating Southern vixen which captivated the the imagination of thousands of the faithful readers of the 1936 novel by Margaret Mitchell. Countless actresses - and unknowns - were considered/tested for the part: Hepburn, Crawford, Davis, Shearer, Joan Bennett, Susan Hayward, Frances Dee, Irene Dunne, Lana Turner, Margaret Tallichet Loretta Young, Miriam Hopkins, Jean Arthur, Paulette Goddard, Tallulah Bankhead, Margaret Sullavan - even Lucille Ball (!) immediately come to mind. Because he was without a doubt the ""King of Hollywood"", it is rather ironic that Clark Gable was right for the part of Rhett Butler. But right he was! This and his performance as Gay Langley in THE MISFITS were his two personal favourites. Imagine who Rhett MIGHT have been: Ronald Colman, Gary Cooper, Warner Baxter, Fredric March & Errol Flynn....o k a y....As Melanie Wilkes, Olivia de Havilland is near perfection and Hattie McDaniel brilliantly made the role of Mammy her own. No wonder she coveted the first Oscar awarded to a Black actress! The scene where Melanie and Mammy climb the stairs towards a half-mad-with-grief Rhett (after Bonnie's accidental death) is a magnificent lesson in screen acting. As a kid, I didn't understand why Ashley Wilkes spoke with an English accent, but his acting style was right for the part. Another standout was Ona Munson (Eve Arden was considered for the part) doing a sterling job portraying that soiled-dove-with-a-heart, Belle Watling: her carriage scene with Melanie is quite memorable. Joan Fontaine, Anne Shirley, Frances Dee, Ann Dvorak & Dorothy Jordan were considered for the part of Ms Wilkes. For Ashley? Melvyn Douglas, Joel McCrea, Jeffrey Lynn, Lew Ayres, Tyrone Power, Ray Milland were all considered. Billie Burke may have been cast as Aunt Pitty & Judy Garland may have gotten to play Carreen! Legend says that this filmed grossed $2O MILLION by May of 194O - which is astounding because of the average price of movie tickets then - 35c - (!). The film was nominated for 13 AA & won 8. Vivien Leigh was personally praised by author Mitchell (whom she resembled somewhat - look at photos of young ""Peggy"" Mitchell) as was Olivia de Havilland and Hattie McDaniel likewise. Mitchell thought Gable was fine as Rhett, but disapproved of Howard as Ashley Wilkes. Reviews for the film were for the most part highly laudatory & the general public was enthralled: Selznick's gamble on hiring a relatively unknown Leigh at first irritated - but later delighted American audiences. It was indeed a victorious gamble. Vivien Leigh herself never cared much for Scarlett. She knew it was a great part, but thought her character was a bit of an ass. Leigh's favourite part? Where Scarlett says that she has turned out ""disappointing"" - concerning her mother's expectations of her - while a bit on the tipsy side."	5.0	...THAT SWEPT THROUGH GEORGIA.	2003-01-02	4	3	1

The performances are outstanding--just as Humphrey Bogart was born to play Sam Spade, Clark Gable was born to play Rhett Butler.  And Olivia DeHavilland as Melanie--what a phenomenal performance.  To me, one of the weak spots is Vivian Leigh--but then again, she's asked to carry an enormous storyline, playing a character who is not exactly easy to like.  (Alas, poor Leslie Howard; could he look any more uncomfortable in a movie?)The physical production holds up well, even today.  The use of creative camera work, the back-lighting, editing, script, and film score all contribute to create a huge, compelling, complete story.At nearly four hours, this is one loooooong movie--but the time passes effortlessly; the viewer can't help but be swept up in the sheer force of the film.""Gone With the Wind"" is a must-see film."	5.0	One of the best films ever made	2003-08-04	6	4	2

Well, for starters, Gable has been deceased for 44 years and Leigh for 37 and no director from the film is alive either in 2004.  Pretty hard to do that when you don't exist anymore.  Further, Leonard Malton was even a movie critic when Gable and Leigh were alive.  Also, Miss deHavilland does have a special place on this new DVD version - a 2004 interview with her on the film.

Vivian Leigh is perfect as Scarlett, her British accent perfectly morphs into the the accent of the southern aristocracy, it's fascinating how many actresses in Hollywood wanted this role...including Lucille Ball!!!, but Leigh owns this role, so much so that you can't imagine anyone else playing her as is the case with Gable, he seems to be having so much fun with Rhett, he always has a mischeivious sparkle in his eye, and he and Leigh have great chemisty, when I watch this film, I am amazed at some of the graphic violence, like when Scarlett shoots the thief at Tara, really vivid for the 30's....really just a great film, always rated in the top five of all time..truly a work of art.  I can't imagine anyone having not seen this film, but if you are one of the few that has not, get yourself some popcorn, and get comfortable and prepared for a great movie experience..a film like no other.	5.0	TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY	2006-03-01	2	2	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AA86EJPZGHZQR	Sharlie I. Grier	I have been waiting for this dvd for a loonngg time and I never thought I would get it.  I became enthralled with GWTW about 15 years ago.  I have seen the Making of GWTW documentary, I own the Vivien Leigh story on VHS, I have seen the footage of the 1939 premiere and the latter reunion in Atlanta.  And for all of this to be on one dvd is AMAZING.  I have looked for the Making of Documentary and never could find it.  I rented it a long time ago and it seemed like it just disapeared.So if you are a GWTW fan then this is the dvd for you.  I was dumbfounded when a movie like GWTW came out on dvd and there were not any special features.They have redeemed themselves with this edition.  It is almost worth it to buy this second dvd with all of these bonuses.  The special features are very hard to find by themselves.  I am dumbstruck that all of these will be on this new edition.	5.0	This will be a jewel.	2004-09-05	12	10	2

I don't know of any story that can even come close to Gone with the Wind and the video was not a disappointment at all.

Gone with the wind is a classic and its so famous. You are just not mature enought to appreciate all the effort that they put into it, you ungrateful modernized idiot!"" Well, something along the lines of that.But that's not true, this is actually an extremely boring movie. It is not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, but it is truly bad. It just never ends! It's like they left the camera on by mistake and videotaped so many unneccessary things. And the lead character is so uninteresting. She is exactly like everybody else in the world. Spoiled, obnoxious, and shallow. Just because the Oscars like this movie doesn't mean I have to, but you can. I just really hate it. However, I appreciate the effort that they put into it. I can see that. It is great considering how old it is. But it's not 1930 anymore, its 2005. That's a little different. And there are soooooooo many movies out now that are exactly like it. So what if gone with the wind was original at the time? The time was around 70 years ago! But what do I know?"	1.0	oh god	2005-01-25	103	6	97

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AK2BKR4BLUWN1	Stephanie	I was 13 when I first saw this movie. I've never read the book and I'm not sure if I'll like the book since I've seen the movie first. This movie is just amazing, in all aspects. It's so old, yet it feels so universal that anyone of any generation could relate to it. It's such a painful movie. Contrary to movies like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; or something of that nature, it shows the not only outcomes of war but the lives that entwined with it. Scarlett would never had been the person she was had it been for the war. Neither Ashley or Melanie. If you're ever stuck at home, sick, pop this movie in with a bowl of hot clam chowder and a warm blanket. Trust me- you'll love it. I do.PS.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AWRNBQ0OPOJZ1	Stephen C. Charitan	An amusing irony is that this Selznick International Picture, once distributed by MGM is now out on a Warner Bros. DVD.  Somewhere in the outer cosmos, Bette Davis must be furiously puffing away on a perpetually smoking cigarette thinking that Scarlett could have been hers after all...However, without intending disrespect to Bette the Great, after all these years there is still no visible seam between Vivien Leigh and Scarlett O'Hara, a point that could be made about the entire GWTW cast.The DVD presentation is worthy of the material, particularly the recent interview with Olivia de Havilland.  You can still sense her awe that she was privileged to be part of something extraordinary - something that has the hint of immortality about it as much as these things can.  I had read that she and Vivien Leigh did not approve of Victor Fleming as director after Cukor had been taken off the picture.  She dispels this by crediting Fleming with giving her the key to Melanie's character.  I won't spoil Miss de Havilland's surprise, but the advice was simple and ultimately made tangible in her performance.What the new re-mastering has done reminds me of the recent restoration of the Sistine Chapel - all the colors are brighter, maybe even a little more garish when compared to the previous incarnation which I always felt to be overly dark.  I think this current edition must be closer to the original intent.  At a time when Technicolor was still relatively rare, I think Selznick wanted to knock his audience out with the brilliance of the colors.  The WB technicians have made it all seem brand new.Hopefully, this will be the last time I have to buy Gone With the Wind, unless of course, they find the missing scenes Selznick cut from the preview print...or a few more Scarlett screen tests...or...perhaps even an alternate take with Mammy in an different color head rag...Yes, I must have it all in full excess!	5.0	You know already you have to have it...	2004-11-11	18	15	3

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AT07UZQQR7ZEH	"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov..."	"GONE WITH THE WIND (1939), producer David O. Selznick's labor of love film of Margaret Mitchell's novel of the Old South, gets my vote as the greatest movie in the history of Hollywood.  Screenplay story and conflicts, characters and perfect casting, Victor Fleming's direction on a vast canvas, and flawless technical credits are incomparable.  It just doesn't get any better than this, folks!  This  is truly the Hollywood studio system summit, the movie against which every other movie is still measured.We open in the innocent days on the eve of the Civil War on the O'Hara and Twelve Oaks Plantations in Georgia.  Scarlett O'Hara has all of the beaux after her, but she only has eyes for cousin Melanie Hamilton's fiance, Ashley Wilkes.  She will carry on a hopeless love affair with the attached Ashley all her life over the course of a movie that goes all the way to maybe 1880 in four hours of running time.  The dashing Rhett Butler, a notorious gambler and blockade runner, finds himself amused by her and wanting a little of her attention.  It takes two failed marriages for Scarlett to finally marry Rhett.  Meanwhile, delicate Melanie marries Ashley, keeps track of him during the war, and nurses him through assorted battles.GONE WITH THE WIND is a huge movie, 220 minutes plus Max Steiner's lovely roadshow music as a DVD bonus.  It presents plantation life before, during, and after the Civil War in the Deep South.  My African-American friends want to know how Selznick treats blacks.  Mammy, Prissy, and Pork are treated with respect and intelligence, even as O'Hara field hands and maids.  They are called ""darkies"", never ""the n- word"", but not with disrespect.  Hattie McDaniel even won an Oscar as Mammy.The cast is just fabulous:  Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, Olivia deHavilland as Melanie, Leslie Howard as Ashley, Thomas Mitchell as Gerald O'Hara, Ann Rutherford and Evelyn Keyes as Scarlett's sisters.  Down to the smaller roles, they are all perfection:  Butterfly McQueen as Prissy, Ona Munson as Belle Watling, Harry Davenport as Doctor Meade, Victor Jory as Jonas Wilkerson.Max Steiner's GWTW music is one of Hollywood's most immortal scores.  Ironically, he won the Oscar in 1939 for John Ford's STAGECOACH.  Ray Rennahan and Ernest Haller were the Technicolor cameramen, and the incomparable William Cameron Menzies won a Special Oscar for making the production design easier for everyone and ""outstanding use of color to establish mood"".  On the new four-disk DVD of GONE WITH THE WIND, the rich Technicolor just shimmers like you are seeing the whole movie for the first time, and Steiner's music is clean and crisp.  The sight and sound transfers are stupendous and stunning.  Warner Home Video has performed miracles.The knowledgeable Rudy Behlmer does audio commentary over the disks 1 and 2 movie, but what he says is duplicated on the brilliant 123 minute disk 3 documentary MAKING OF A LEGEND (1989) so I recommend skipping Behlmer, unless you want to see the actual movie twice.  The 1989 documentary is very thorough, taking us through pre-production, production, and post-production.  It always gives me excitement goosebumps as the movie nears its completion and gets sneak-previewed.  Imagine a sneak-preview of the four hour GWTW in 1939!  Also included on disk 3 are footage of the 1939 Atlanta premiere.  Disk 4's big item is a 40 minute brand-new chat with still-lovely 88 year old Olivia deHavilland on the making of the movie; she is polite and gracious.  We also get feature-length TV biographies of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, and bite-size biographies of a dozen more major cast members.  Even I, as a film scholar, found new insights here.When I last looked, this incomparably beautiful and overwhelming four-disk DVD of GONE WITH THE WIND was selling for only $30, less than a family of four going to one new movie at night and getting minimal refreshments.  That's one scary thought!  GONE WITH THE WIND, greatest movie of all time, is a much better buy.  No question.  After 65 years, Selznick's masterpiece still has the power to stagger and move an audience, and has a DVD boxed set worthy of it."	5.0	The Hollywood studio system summit--10 stars	2005-10-23	8	6	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A14HHOT9999Z22	"Stephen M. Moser ""The Austin Chronicle"""	"Everything you ever wanted to know about *GWTW* -- from Margaret Mitchell recalling her mother driving her out to see the ruined plantations around Atlanta, and telling her that she'd better learn to survive, to its historic status as being one of the most beloved movies of all time - even when it's not politically correct to love the movie. It is a documentary combining spoken word, letters, memos, newsclips, diaries and recreations - in a comprehensive style that predates Ken Burns by quite a bit. It is a dizzying montage of information and images that tells the story of the film - a monumental achievement that is one of the few films to not disappoint the lovers of the book. Selznick purchased the rights to the story for $50,000 - a fortune at the time, for a story so sprawling that it was impossible to visualize on the screen. As a superb craftsman, even Selznick was intimidated - not just by the scope of the story, but by the public's obsession with it. So it is with tender care that he began preproduction and scriptwriting on this sacred monster. The footage that we see in the finished version of *GWTW* shows only a small part of the passion, heartache and bloodletting that went on behind the scenes. Most impressive is the existing array of screen tests that were done for the movie - evidence that the much-ballyhooed Search for Scarlett O'Hara was far more than hype from a hotheaded publicist. Showing dozens of would-be Scarletts, Melanies, Ashleys and Belles, the most stunning footage is the multiple and lengthy tests that Paulette Goddard did for the role of Scarlett. She exhibits a cunning and slyness that is perfect for Scarlett, and the newsreports go crazy announcing her unconfirmed appointment. It is the sheer numbers of tests that Goddard did the continually amazing, and she had every reason on earth to believe she had the part. It's easy to see that she would have been delightful as Scarlett, but could she have made Scarlett into the legend that Vivian Leigh did? Fraught with tension, shooting began without Scarlett having been cast. The story behind the filming of the burning of Atlanta is riveting in its detail, showing how old sets from *King Kong* and *Birth of a Nation*, among others, were burned and then multiplied on film to create the effect. It was during the filming of this sequence that Selznick's brother, Myron, legendarily arrived on the set with a gorgeous young woman in tow and said to the producer, ""I'd like you to meet your Scarlett."" And the film's fate was sealed with the casting of the tragic and incandescent Vivian Leigh. Though Selznick was reviled by Hedda Hopper, among others, for casting an English girl, instead of a red-blooded American, even Margaret Mitchell herself said, ""Better an English girl than a Yankee."" Goddard had been frontrunner up to the last second when Leigh waltzed in and stole the part from under her nose. It must have been an unbearably bitter disappointment, and Goddard never again realized the potential she showed in these tests. But, it is also only a small facet of what happened behind the scenes. After a time, miles of film were scrapped when original director George Cukor was fired and replaced by Victor Fleming. There's quite a tale behind *that* that neither the documentary, nor we, will go into. The personal dramas are many, with Selznick's drug use, health problems and subsequent breakdown being addressed. The volume of information collected is awesome. From Butterfly McQueen speaking about her role as Prissy (""I wouldn't let them slap me, but I thought Prissy needed to be slapped...I thought she was horrid.""), to the footage of Hattie MacDaniel's Academy Award speech that is so sincere and touching that it must be considered a gift that we can still see it. It was a scandal that the movie cost $3,000,000 to make: a jaw-droppingly small figure for a movie that paid for itself many, many times over - and *that's* just in financial terms."	5.0	GWTW: The Making Of A Legend	2005-01-23	9	7	2
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2F7XTL4KHDZME	Stephen Reginald	What more can you say about one of America's most celebrated films?  Plenty.  Taken simply as a romance with the Civil War as a backdrop for the life and times of Scarlet O'Hara (Vivian Leigh) it's superb entertainment.  And that after all is what this film is about.  Critics of its not being historically accurate, miss this point entirely.  After more than 60 years, Gone With the Wind remains one of the most compelling narratives in film history.  The script, worked on by just about everyone in Hollywood, including F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ben Hecht, has some of the best dialogue ever written.  The splendid cast (with the possible exception of  Lesley Howard as Ashley Wilkes) acts up a storm with Leigh a stunner in this her American film debut.  Clark Gable's Rhett Butler is appropriately roguish and charming at the same time, and it's easy to see why the public (and producer David O. Selznick) couldn't see anyone else in this role. Olivia de Haviland shines as Melanie creating one of the film's most memorable characters.  In the hands of a less competent actress, she would have been too good to be believed, but de Haviland created a real three- dimensional character:  we can't help but admire her strength.  Hattie McDaniel gives a strong characterization as Mammy, the no-nonsense servant to generations of the O'Hara clan.  McDaniel's role was awarded an Oscar for best supporting actress (she was up against de Haviland) and she is remembered as the first African-American to be so honored.  The film is filled with wonderful supporting performances by some of the best actors of the day including Jane Darwell, Thomas Mitchell, Ward Bond, and Ona Munson.  For a film that is almost four hours long, it goes by quite quickly.  The production is first rate and the video restoration is superb, looking as fresh as when it was first released in 1939.  As pure entertainment, it's hard to do better than GWTW; it's easy to see how this classic has become a part of the American psyche.	5.0	The Great American Classic	2001-04-06	20	16	4

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1VGBF6COR3SIA	Susan Sloate, Author, FORWARD TO CAMELOT and ...	This is one of the few absolutely must-see films I can imagine for any American filmgoer. It's important not just for what it offers you but because it is so important a piece of Americana that not to know it leaves a hole in your own cultural background. Frankly, my dear, it helps to know what everyone else is talking about!Ironically, when I first saw the film, at age ten, I was fresh from reading the book ... and I was disappointed, because the book was, frankly, better. (Margaret Mitchell had 1,037 pages to tell her story; David Selznick had a little less than 4 hours -- it makes a difference!) But having seen the film again and again and read a lot about the making of it in the ensuing years, it is clear to me now that the makers have made about as perfect a film as it was possible to make ... given the technical restraints of 1939 (many of which they blasted to new heights) and the length of the story they had to tell.The musical score, production design, costumes and technical wizardry are no less than perfect. Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland are no less than extraordinary. And Clark Gable's performance is possibly the very best acting that I have ever seen on film. Gable is SO good that it is hard to remember that he is acting. He simply inhabits the role in a way that should be the envy of all actors everywhere. It is criminal that he was not awarded the Academy's Best Actor prize for this part. (I'm sure most people don't realize that -- but he lost to Robert Donat in GOODBYE, MR. CHIPS. Highway robbery, in my opinion.)There are, absolutely, some letdowns in the film -- but many of them are indigenous to their source material, Miss Mitchell's gripping novel. The first half is simply more tense than the second, which spans a number of years and includes Scarlett's marriage to Rhett, her growing evolution as a businesswoman and the birth of their daughter Bonnie. I think the way the screenwriters handle these transitions is masterful. They have managed to include just about every important transition in Scarlett's life, and still keep the pace moving.It doesn't have to be your favorite film ... or your favorite book ... or your favorite subject. It is still supremely watchable and remarkable. It will keep your attention and will probably help you understand what all the fuss is about. I urge you to see it, no matter what. Sometimes classics are simply classics because teachers talk about them too much. No one really wants to read them, or God forbid, waste time seeing a film about them. This is a classic because the story touched so many, and because the filmmakers respected Margaret Mitchell's story and as much as possible, simply left it alone. It is not worth seeing to raise your intellect. It is worth seeing to grab your heart. That's why so many of us still see it ... again and again and again.	5.0	Even if you hate the Civil War &amp; epic movies ... see it!	2001-02-07	5	4	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A37NL9EDUT23IV	"takemehome ""Joey"""	Gone With The Wind is one of my favorite movies of all time, with Scarlett O'Hara as one of the all-time great book/movie characters. Despite the racial stereotypes presented in the film, which at the time were actually breaking from the stereotypes of the day, but eventually turned into stereotypes of their own, I thoroughly enjoy the movie. But I won't discuss the film too much, as practically everyone knows what it's about by now.When GWTW was first released on DVD in 1998, it included a trivia game and a trailer that seemed as if it had a different audio track than it originally had as two flimsy bonus features. The print was nice, but it suffered from some grain and effects from the shrinking of all Technicolor elements. However, in 2004, Warner Bros. gave us fans a DVD worthy of the biggest movie ever made. (To this day, no movie has sold as many tickets.) Four discs, the film in a new gorgeous restoration that rivals any restoration performed on it in the past, and wonderful bonus features.Discs 1 and 2, labeled The Movie, have the movie beautifully restored with Warner Bros. Ultra Resolution process, which forces every frame of every element of the Technicolor negative to align perfect, revealing sharp, crisp detail. A real removal of excess grain and dirt and good work on the colors as well as a digital restoration of the soundtrack make this the best version ever available. The only bonus feautre on these discs is an audio commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer.Disc 3, labeled About The Movie, includes all kinds of bonuses about the making of the movie. The real meat of this disc is the 2-hour Making Of A Legend documentary, making its DVD debut here. This documentary provides all of the behind-the-scenes info you could ever want and includes rare screen tests of other actresses who hoped to be Scarlett, such as Susan Hayward and Lana Turner. Also on this disc is a featurette on the restoration, which gives the viewer insight on the Ultra Resolution process. There are also two premiere newsreels, a gallery of trailers, the prologue from overseas versions, scenes with foreign language dubbing, and a historical short subject titled The Old South.Disc 4, labeled About The Cast, doesn't contain quite as much, but is still very satisfactory. The real gem is the 2004 interview featurette Melanie Remembers: Reflections by Olivia de Havilland, in which Olivia gives her reflections on the making of this classic. Also included are two wonderful profile featurettes on Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. Both tell of the stories and stuggles of two of the all time great movie stars. Also included on disc 4 are many very short featurettes on the supporting players. It was here that I found out that Cammie King, the little girl who played Bonnie Blue Butler, had only one other film role - the voice of Faline in Disney's perennial classic Bambi.Finally, this box set comes with a booklet - a reproduction of the original lobby brochure. A beautiful booklet and a sweet extra to have along with these four DVD discs of incredible stuff.My review can't possibly do justice to this incredible DVD release of this legendary film.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3GHENISP872DC	Tara Lover	I love this collection!  I bought the previous anniversary edition from the 60th anniversary but this one has so many additions and the red velvet box is the perfect storage case.The only complaint I have is that I ordered two of these collections and the second one was missing the 10 piece watercolor postcard set.  It's really unfortunate because that was the one I gave to my friend as a birthday gift.  It's the fault of the manufacturer, not Amazon.  It was a good thing my friend didn't make a big deal of it.  It really is the least of all the items in the collection, anyway.  But I did make color copies on postcard paper stock so all is well!	5.0	Fantastic Collection!  However...	2011-04-07	1	0	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2AD1LKUZ92L0Q	Taylor	When I first saw the length of this movie *approximately 4 hours* I was a  little skeptical. Would this length make for several boring parts? I  decided to see the movie anyway, and I am SO glad that I did.  Gone With  the Wind is an absolutely spectacular movie, filled with every element you  could wish for in a movie; romance, action, drama, and more. The story is  timeless; Scarlett O'Hara *stunningly played by Vivien Leigh*, a  coquettish, selfish, and conceited Southern belle who attempts conceals her  inner cleverness from the male population, is the main character of this  story.  She is madly in love with Ashley Wilkes *Leslie Howard does a  rather good job making this character exactly what he should be*, an  abnormal young dreamer, who happens to be engaged to his cousin, Melanie  Hamilton *beautifully portrayed by Olivia deHavilland*. When war breaks out  in the South, Scarlett's world is turned upside down. During her odyssey,  Scarlett meets Rhett Butler *incredible Clark Gable does a flawless job*, a  cagey, aloof non-gentleman who can see through Scarlett's coquettry. Thus  begins this tale of love, war, loss, and gain.  This is truly a film that  you DON'T want to miss.	5.0	Absolutely Incredible!	2000-08-06	13	11	2
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1O93STFZ8GVUD	"tboogie ""tia"""	this movie is ahead of its time and i'm not just talking about the famous swear word clark gable used. there was so much history made. this was before big budget blow em' up epics. this was the original blockbuster, selling more tickets than any movie in history. and than there were the oscars, it received 11 in total, one of them being the first to go to an african american. hattie mcdanielle opened the door for actors like halle berry and denzel washington and it was all while playing straight talking, no nonsense, mammie. i am a 21 year old african american woman and i completely understand the significance of that. understand that the only roles that black people could play was that of domestic house workers so for a woman to come along and beat her all caucasian competition based solely on her skills as an actress is nothing to sneeze at. it is a movie full of stereotypical black and female roles, but its also more than that. this is not a documentary on the civil war or about the horrible cruelty of human bondage. it is merely a snap shot in time. a time when a simple  story, told absolutely perfectly, could capture a generation's imagination and not let go. i consider it a must see no matter of age or race.	5.0	ahead of its time	2009-07-21	4	3	1

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A223RY5K49US1Z	TeeBee	"There is more offensive racist content in the opening credits of this film than in the entirety of the wonderful ""Song Of The South"" (set in the post-Civil War south) currently being suppressed by Disney. Hattie McDaniel richly deserved her Academy Award (and is likewise wonderful in SOTS, which also gives us a glimpse of her musical talent), but the glorification of the culture of slavery that permeates every frame of the film is disgusting and is not redeemed by the overblown production values. The choppiness of the storyline reflects the lack of continuity due to multiple directors and re-writes, and the last hour is especially tedious. Why this film is glorified and ""Song Of The South"" suppressed is beyond me. ""...A civilization Gone With The Wind""... if only that were true; the current series of noose-hangings throughout my own New York-New Jersey metropolitan area proves that racism is the dirty little gift that keeps on giving.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1EB3EO0NZ1LO	The Movie Critic	Gone With the Wind is an amazing movie for the time it was made in. Up until then, no other movie had been made like it and it's still one of the most popular movies ever. Gone With the Wind is an epic and everything about it is outstanding from the direction to the camerawork to the scenery. Such a lot of work went into making it and it certainly paid off. The actors and the characters they played were very good and most of them are very likeable. Clark Gable was very good considering that he didn't even want to be in the movie. And it took forever but they searched and searched and finally found the right person to play Scarlet O'Hara.But to fully appreciate Gone With the Wind, you must see the making of it. After I saw it, I realised that such a lot of unnoticed work had gone into it and everything was so stressed out over. Parts of the script were rewritten time and time again to improve it constantly. Scenes were shot over and over again and the colours of the sky and the horizon were chosen to make the movie seem duller to fit with the depression of the story. A lot of the scenes were combined with painted backgrounds and they're done so well that you would never even know. And they're just a few examples. When you hear about all the work that went into it, it makes Gone With the Wind even better and it also makes you appreciate it even more. (It also makes you wonder how they ever got it finished.) But Gone With the Wind, as well as the making of it, are both very good. I almost can't believe that it was made in 1939.	5.0	An amazing movie for it's time.	2000-11-08	5	4	1

However, even though I know it was originally produced in a standard full screen format, as I saw it in 1956, it was then re-cropped to look like wide screen. Regretfully for me, I became used to this wider screen version I experience in 1968. Upon showing this film with my 9ft wide, HD, 7 surround, movie screen this past year, I was really disappointed that this particular verson was not wide screen. All else in the movie is superb: Scarlet could not be more selfish, sensual, and expoitive, and Rhett Butler could not be more handsome, beguiling and overwhemingly charming. Still, this movie remains way above the production quality, details, and scope that most other movies have today.	3.0	Awesome quality, yet disapointed in its format	2013-09-07	0	0	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ATB8MP2M9L5PM	"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815"""	"This edition of ""Gone with the Wind"" comes in an old-fashioned DVD keep-case (the kind with the plastic ridge that snaps shut over a cardboard fold-out box) with two or three nice extra features. It's a very basic 1990s (1998 to be specific) DVD product, presumably the original release of the film in this format. Although the picture and sound are not as sharp as the many other versions (2-disc, 3-disc, and 4-disc) currently on disc, I got this one because I wanted one disc rather than a bunch of discs to fiddle with. The picture quality here is comparable to the 1990s theatrical re-release restorations (also released on DVD) of ""Vertigo"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" cleaning up the dirt in each frame without adding excessive sharpness and contrast to the picture. Is is the old manual frame-by-frame cleanup with THX-sound and minimal computer work. In that sense, this DVD is probably truer to the original theatrical experience than the all-digital work being done today, which makes classic films look unbelievably better than they ever did in the first place. If you're a film purist, you might actually prefer this original DVD release to the fancier special editions than have since come out, although the new versions are eye-popping in their appealingly sharp visuals.In any event, ""Gone with the Wind"" is a romanticized ode to the Old South that simultaneously shows it in all its narcissistic warts, achieving a rare excellence in the way it brings us into the story of the South's fall in the Civil War on a very personal level. It's one of the great film spectacles of American cinema history, more than three and a half hours long, but is surprisingly fast-moving and contemporary in its treatment. It features memorable characters played by great actors at the top of their game. Scarlett O'Hara, the ruthless Southern Catholic belle whose narcissism makes everyone around her miserable even as it enables them to survive the post-war ruin of their fortunes, is one of the most memorable girl power leads in movie history. Rhett Butler, the self-aware rogue who realizes too late that Scarlett refuses to acknowledge her own roguery, is a strong foible. Clark Cable and Vivian Leigh are electric together, supported by a great supporting cast. Only in ""Gone with the Wind"" do we learn that the Civil War was really fought to teach Scarlett a lesson."	5.0	"One-disc edition of ""Gone with the Wind"""	2014-03-01	1	1	0
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3JVEYKV80CXXA	Travis LaMotta	"I love how Warner Brothers Pictures decorates their great classic films with amazing DVD's.  ""Gone with the Wind"" is probably the best film the studio ever produced, and it's finally being treated as such.  A single disc version could never contain this masterpiece so it's been updated to a four-disc version!  It's incredible!  ""The Star Wars Trilogy"" aside, this is the one DVD you must buy this fall.  Now when will Warner Bros. give ""The Wizard of Oz"" special treatment?"	5.0	An American Treasure	2004-09-11	7	4	3
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1YHQ1JWEJK6BI	"Travis Newman ""-Producer, CPP"""	I had avoided this classic for my entire life based on my false assumption that it was going to be the original and ultamite chick flick of the ages.  Willing to give anything a shot, I finally watched Gone with the Wind and was very impressed.  I am sure there are a lot of people that feel the same way I did about this movie and still have not seen it, but I suggest they not make hasty decisions on something that they have not already experienced.As I watched the movie, the most impressive thing to me was just how vibrant the colors are on the dvd. Along with those vibrant colors, the sharp tongues threw me off guard at first and led me to enjoy the dialogue as well as the picture.  The plot was very interesting and kept me interested throughout this lengthy motion picture. Throughout the film, there are a lot of interesting characters and many were perfectly casted. However, no movie is complete without a great ending, Gone with the Wind takes itself to the top of the movie mountain and doesn't look back.  Powerful, appropriate and ever-lasting in all our memories, simply one of the greatest of all-time.As I already stated, I was very pleased with Gone with the Wind, it is funny, witty, charming, emotional, powerful and the list goes on.  It does not become a stale cliche like we have grown so accustomed to. I have finally realized why Gone with the Wind is truly a classic among classics and hope that those who have not taken the time to view this movie do so, they will not be disappointed.	5.0	Pleasantly Suprising	2002-10-22	6	5	1

Scarlett is beautiful. She has vitality. But Ashley, the man she has wanted for so long, is going to marry his placid cousin, Melanie. Mammy warns Scarlett to behave herself at the party at Twelve Oaks. There is a new man there that day, the day the Civil War begins. Rhett Butler. Scarlett does not know he is in the room when she pleads with Ashley to choose her instead of Melanie. This movie shows the best of the American cinema. Whether you like the movie, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. ""Gone with the Wind"" represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this movie. A triumph of film-making ingenuity and genius, that will live on for many generations to come.

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1L8ZNH8EHVR40	Tricia Love	"Although I know that I am most certainly in the minority, I think that Vivien Leigh was miscast as Scarlett O'Hara.  Even though her feisty portrayal was certainly worthy of an Oscar, her ethereal, 'Dresden Shepherdess' beauty did not match Scarlett's hard life. A more believable Scarlett would have been portrayed by Bette Davis or Joan Crawford.  To quote from the Dictionary of Literary Characters:- ""Scarlett O'Hara. An impetuous, flirtatious and Infuriating Southern belle, who delights in her powers of ensnarement. Scarlett is, (according to Margaret Mitchell) 'not beautiful, but men seldom realised it when caught by her charm.""  I also thought Leslie Howard was miscast as Ashley Wilkes. Looking too effeminate for the role, Ashley comes over more as a weak  type rather than the strong honorable gentleman he is.  ""He hunts, gambles and participates in the social scene.  He is a complex figure of liberal persuasion interested in books and music.  There is an Englishness of the Old South about his nature.""  Someone more of the calibre of Colin Firth would have been better, (although Colin Firth was not even born in 1939)The BEST casting was of Clark Gable as Rhett Butler.  His charisma just jumps off the screen.  He IS Rhett Butler! He is handsome but not TOO handsome.  Not baby faced like Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise, but manly, mature, virile and fit. The kind of man one hardly ever sees portrayed on screen now-a-days. Commanding and sure of himself.  The next best casting was of Olivia DeHavilland as Melanie Hamilton, then the black maid.The story is magnificent. Margaret Mitchell could never better herself. It just has everything in it.  I read the book from cover to cover when I was confined to a hospital bed for a long period of time many years ago. I never wanted the book to end. As usual the film never quite measures up to the book, but they did a very good job. I would recommend the book to anyone (and have done many times) but I would also recommend the film, as I said, they did a very good job."	4.0	Miscasting	2004-08-23	10	2	8

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A2DLVJVYAVG37U	Up The Stairs	I've seen Gone With the Wind many, many times.  Each additional time I've seen it it gets worse.  The acting is often over stated, and the casting is sometimes questionable, as well.  Could it have hurt the producers to have used real Americans to play Americans in an American made movie about Americans?  Clark Gable is awesome as Rhett Butler, and the buck stops there.  But the worst problems with GWtW is it insipid portrayal of Blacks, its racist tones, and its shabby reflection on history.  Scarlett O'Hara is not a likable character.  Up until the final curtain, she's continually selfish and self-centered.  Four hours of Scarlett is about 3.5 hours too much.	4.0	Over Wrought	2008-05-26	13	2	11
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3N61N91YEIZ47	"Valerie Matteson ""Bookaholic"""	"I remember the first time I saw this movie.  My mom took me to see it at our  local theatre and it was 1961.  They even had an intermission so you could get more popcorn!!  I just loved the movie and when I was older (was only 10 when I saw movie) read the book as well.  So of course when we saw this beautiful edition on sale at our local electronics store I had to have it!!It is just amazing what they can do now to ""clean up"" the sound so the scratches and static on older VHS/DVD formats are gone and it sounds just like it did in the theatre.  I was also extremely impressed with the re-colorization they did to bring back the green in Viven Leigh's eyes -- she really did have the Scarlett O'Hara eyes -- that was lost in the older versions.The story is uplifting and sad at the same time.  It was a time in the South that is often forgotten.  It is also a story that you can't place in the context of today's world or it would seem silly or racist or violent.  However, Margaret Mitchell, the author of the book it is based on, DID romanticize the South a lot so you do have to take the storyline and so forth with a least a pound of salt!!For me the most unforgettable performances are of Butterfly McQueen and Clark Gable.  If you've never seen this movie, it is well worth watching just for the visuals and those two performances.Wonderfully restored."	5.0	A classic movie beautifully restored for sight and sound!	2007-03-23	8	6	2

In fact, I did not mind the length in the least except the minor inconvenience of switching the dvd's halfway through.I only recently watched this and I must say I was quite happy with it. First off, I must say that the quality of the restoration is incredible. It looks like it could have been made recently as opposed to decades ago. I was in awe of it. It must have taken them months and months of painstaking computer work to accomplish this. I wouldn't watch it any other way.As for the film, well, it really is unique. So much goes on and its quite a journey. Rhett Butler has got to be one of my favorite characters anywhere. Clark Gable was simply wonderful in this. I adored the bickering between Rhett and Scarlett, it was really a joy. I can't believe I waited so long to watch this. I understand some liberties had to be taken in regards to the book. I know that they didn't include 2 of Scarlett's children. I did not read the book so I don't know how important they really were to the movie. I know purists argue this but since I am only basing this review on the movie, I didn't feel that it felt like something was missing from it. It felt complete and thorough.

But it is not just the film that romanticizes slavery and the Civil War.  Film critics have also romanticized those issues, avoiding them.Yes, the characters of ""Mammy"" and ""Prissy"" were different stereotypes than the Stepin Fetichit type.  But think of it.  ""Mammy""?  How is that a better stereotype, really--the African American woman who enjoyed being a slave, who was the pawn of the white people who owned her.  And Prissy was a total idiot--hardly complimentary to any person of colour.I once tried reading ""Gone With The Wind"" as it had been described as a classic novel.  I think I got to page two, when I read Margaret Mitchell's description of the ""niggery smells"".  Put the book down and never opened it again.  Why read racist trash?""Gone With The Wind"" is a romanticized view of the South, but a racist view.  Let's not forget that the Northerners in the film are universally viewed as evil people expoiting the black people.  This is a romanticized view of racism that only an apologist for slavery could possibly accept.  Are we supposed to forget that the film portrays the Ku Klux Klan as just plain swell?The film makers at the time knew what slavery was.  They knew the evil of it, and of the Ku Klux Klan.  What they really wanted to do was make people forget what the Civil War was all about.Finally, as some other reviewers on this site acknowledge, in the second half of the film all that wonderful story telling falls apart.  The film loses its drive when it leaves behind the glory days of Tara, going from one incident to another.  The last half hour of the film totally degenerates into key characters being knocked off.  Only the last line is really memorable, and sums up my own feelings about this film: frankly, I don't give a damn!"	3.0	Going, going...gone	2006-11-09	39	9	30

Some of the history is good, and none is as bad as its detractors would like it to be.If you have not seen GWTW, you must do so to say that you know great American films."	5.0	The Immortal GWTW	2008-08-18	3	2	1
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3CFT5LHFCB46K	"""weirdo_87"""	"Where does one start when reviewing this film? For decades, this has been one of America's most popular and beloved movies. It is not exactly perfect. Showing a sentimental, somewhat politically incorrect view of the old south. There are only a few slaves in the film, and all of them are on good terms with their owners and even remain in their employing after the war. The film is also very melodramatic (If I here ""The Yankees"" shouted once more, I will go nuts) and contains several clich&eacute;s, though they only become those later. Finally, many viewers can name better ways to spend 4 hours. That said this movie is hard to dislike, what with its enormous ambition, still impressive visuals and very good story. And while indeed lengthy, I loved every minute.Everything about this movie is big. It's scope, covering events before, during and after the Civil War as adapted from Margaret Mitchell's also epic novel. One has to give credit to the makers for trying to compress the 1,000+ page book into a single film. Today, most would either make a mini-series or film trilogy. This might have been a wiser idea but, having not read the book, I can't say if it would have been more faithful. The production values are also enormous, with incredible, very spacious sets of plantation homes before the war and some great views of some of the buildings destroyed by the ravages of war. There are many images that are still amazing today: As Scarlett searches for a doctor, the camera pulls back to reveal that she is in a wide open area filled with dead and dying soldiers of the confederacy. The destruction of Atlanta is also still a great action scene (The great wall built for ""King Kong"" was burned down and scenes of its destruction utilized in those fiery shots of Atlanta).Another big item about this film is the cast and crew. We all know of David Selznick's legendary search for the actress to play Scarlett O'Hara, which resulted in over 1,400 people tested for the role and the selection of Vivian Leigh over such competitors as Bette Davis, Katherine Hepburn and finalists Joan Bennett and Paulette Goddard. This is a difficult but great role, appealing to all sexes. For women, she is strong willed, intelligent, courageous and beautiful, if bratty and spoiled. For men, they will mostly focus on the beauty. While it may not seem like it, she matures during the plot of the film. For the first time in her life, she is on her own and has to use her strength and willpower to make it through. Earlier, she winces at the sight of wounded soldiers in the hospital. Later, when a deserter from the union threatens her, Scarlett shoots him without hesitation. The New York Times remarked that Leigh's Scarlett ""Is so beautiful she hardly need be talented, and so talented she need not be beautiful...""It's been a mass opinion over the years that Clark Gable was a wooden actor who just got lucky being cast in parts made for him. I can't agree with that since the only other of his films I have seen is ""It Happened One Night"". However, he is very appealing in the role of Rhett Butler to many people, just like Leigh. Most of Gable's performance and legacy has been based on his last line. However, I find that to be just a bit flawed: It's better to first day ""Frankly, my dear"", take a short pause, then say ""I don't give a damn"" with more emphasis. It seemed to me that he treated it as a throwaway line (Which in 1939 would have been enough to make the line remembered). The most memorable image of Gable in the movie, for me, is his first scene: As Scarlett and the other girls look down while at Twelve Acres, Butler is looking up from the stairway's bottom, with the camera moving in until it is focused on his grinning face. That appearance ranks as one of the most memorable entrances in film history, alongside Orson Welles in ""The Third Man"" and Omar Shariff in ""Lawrence of Arabia"".The other two top billed stars are Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland as Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton. Scarlett has been in love with Ashley for what I assume is her whole life, yet Ashley marries and is very much in love with Melanie (Which, from our view today, is somewhat demented since they are cousins. But such things must have been common in the old south). Scarlett, being spoiled and selfish, still tries to gain Ashley's love, even after he is married and consummates it (We assume, since they go into their room together and close the door and the light). Too late does she realize she loves Rhett and that Ashley has no interest in her. But Scarlett's mistake is understandable. After all, Ashley is more likable and more of a gentleman than Rhett (Though, when it comes to looks, most women would consider a draw).I may be considered a rebel for this since I am a male teenager, but I am recommending ""Gone With the Wind"". It's very melodramatic, rather long and that music score gets occasionally irritating, but it just has some magic about it that all great movies have: A magic that keeps them from dying. I think audiences in 2039 will still be just as awed and excited as people were a century before. The era may be ""gone with the wind"", but the movie is here to stay."	4.0	It is a great movie!	2002-06-21	7	3	4

But I have a problem with the framing: it's evident from the opening credits that the lettering is too large because the periphery of the image is gone. That's not a good thing.About the movie: author Margaret Mitchell had the same reaction, I would find out, to me in regards to the casting-- even though she asked to be left out of the creative process of the picture, she thought the 4 leads were PERFECT, with the notable exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes whom she, too, thought was all wrong. (Howard played Ashley as a priss, which is not exactly what he was in the book, where you could understand Scarlett's lasting fondness for him; in the movie, you have no idea why she's fixated on this pantywaste--- and Howard didn't even WANT to do the movie!)"	5.0	Classic extravaganza	2005-01-24	0	0	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ACVQPIKFFP5QZ	William Mack	There are so few books, movies, and products that just really light a fire under my, well, you know where region.  The movie COLD MOUNTAIN was one such thing.  The novel THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD was another such item.  And of course, the ubiquitous and compelling classic that we all know------GONE WITH THE WIND.  The first time I've seen this movie, I was fourteen years old. At that age, not many teenagers would even bother watching a classic or even adore it. It is a beautiful love story and not only that, &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; shows how the civil war affected the people of the South. How the grace and beauty of the south changed dramatically. And what's great, Scarlett is the star. A head-strong woman who made it through the war with very much emotional stars but survived and beat the odds. Scarlett is a take-charge woman and doesn't let anything or anyone stand in her way. Unfortunately with that personality you have few friends and your loved ones sometimes loses their patience. LOVE AND STRUGGLE is the basis of this movie. EXTREMELY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!	5.0	Breezy	2005-07-06	1	1	0

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"As with the ""Wizard of OZ"" BD set, the GWTW set is elaborated -- and made ""spendier"" -- with the addition of material that might not be absolutely necessary for one's enjoyment. The box is covered in red velvet flocking (green would have been more appropriate and amusing -- qv, Carol Burnett). There's a CD ""sampler"" of Max Steiner's score, running a measly 45 minutes. Given that Max took excessive scoring to the max (Bette Davis had some pointedly unkind things to say about it), a ""sampler"" could have filled two CDs, and still not have exhausted the music (though the music might exhaust you). *As with ""OZ"", there's a 52-page hard-backed book that's largely content-free, plus reproductions of some of the watercolor set-design paintings (in their own little envelope), and various memoranda sent to and from David O. Selznick. I was expecting a reproduction of Gerald O'Hara's pocket watch, but it likely would have been of even poorer quality than the kiddie watch in the ""OZ"" box.The best bonus is a reproduction of the 25-cent (expensive in 1939) souvenir booklet. It includes pieces by the principals, notably one from Clark Gable telling how badly he wanted to play Rhett Butler and much he enjoyed every minute of making the film. (He didn't want to appear in ""costume"" films (having had bad luck in a film about Irish revolutionaries), was afraid to take on a role the public had such definite ideas about, and got along poorly with the first director, George Cukor.)As I write this, I haven't viewed all the supplemental material on the second disk. (There's a lot.) The third disk duplicates the ""When the Lion Roars"" feature included in the ""OZ"" box -- though the package labeling suggests it's unique to GWTW.GWTW was always unsharp and muddy-looking -- until the Ultra Resolution transfer of the original three-strip negatives a few years ago. It was a major improvement, and the DVDs showed the film as it had never been seen.This edition apparently uses a new Ultra Resolution transfer, at twice the resolution (8k versus 4k) of the previous. Some scenes -- such as Ashley escorting Melanie to the balcony of Twin Oaks -- are breathtaking, far superior to what the DVD offered (and /that/ wasn't exactly chopped liver). The best Technicolor films, properly transferred, push HD to its limit.What most surprised me, though, was the awareness of how the film's color balance is adjusted to produce specific effects. Many scenes have an appropriately warm, ""burnished"" coloration that /does not/ carry over to the scene's subtle colors. For example, at the fund-raising bazaar, there's a bottle of pastel-colored candies (which you'll probably never notice in the SD edition) that retain their correct colors, ""unromantized"" by the rest of the image's warmth. Similarly, in the scene outside the hospital where Belle Watling makes a donation, her costume is vividly colored (there's no question about her profession!), even though everything else is drab.Several sequences are outstanding, particularly the one where Scarlett returns to Aunt Pittypat's home to tend to Melanie. It's a model of Technicolor photography, one that any cinematographer would be proud of -- as good as anything being done today. In earlier transfers of poorer prints, this sequence is flat and two-dimensional. You can't see how magnificently lit and photographed it is.At its best, the Technicolor resembles large-format, ultra-sharp Polacolor. That's a compliment! If you're fortunate enough to have a large display, you'll gasp at some of the images.One of the most-startling moments occurs when Scarlett goes to the train station to look for Dr Meade, one of the most-famous scenes in movie history. Hundreds, if not thousands of injured men lie on the ground, waiting for medical attention that will likely never come. There weren't enough extras, so dummies were used. And for the first time, you can actually /see/ which of the ""extras"" are dummies! You can probably tell better than the camera operator!In short... The BD edition is a major improvement over the excellent DVD edition. It gives the impression that the movie makers were able to manipulate Technicolor to get specific aesthetic effects. ** And it shows just how /beautifully photographed/ this film is, something even the original Technicolor prints never fully revealed. The DVD probably captured most of this (I no longer have it for comparison), but you'll never see it in standard definition on a ""small"" screen. Looking at excerpts in the supplmentary material /not/ taken from the Ultra Resolution transfer is a reminder of just how ""messy""-looking the original GWTW was. It no longer is. I've never enjoyed watching it so much.It's becoming apparent that an HD transfer, shown on a big display, is not the best way to watch a movie at home, but the best way to watch a movie, period.The sound is so-so, of limited range and not particularly clean. (Disney does a much better job cleaning up the audio of its classic films.) The reviewer who said it filled the room as well as any modern soundtrack most own Bose 901s. It would sound better in a theater, with big horn speakers that started rolling off above 5kHz. If GWTW was recorded in RCA multi-track, the stems don't appear to have survived. (Those for ""OZ"" exist and have been used, though not, apparently in the Blu-ray.) Music and dialog are mono throughout, but individual sound effects (particulary explosions) are panned to the side or rear when appropriate. The music sometimes seems too loud for the dialog, and the overall level is by far the lowest of any Blu-ray I've yet auditioned. I had to really crank up the volume, far, far beyond 11.This is an expensive set, but it represents such a significant improvement over the last DVD edition (as good as it was) that it's worth seriously considering. Even if your BD player has a good scaler, the DVD won't look anywhere nearly this good on your HD monitor. Highly recommended.PS: Just because a film is a classic doesn't mean it's suitable for everyone in your family. The G rating is ridiculous. GWTW is at least PG, containing, as it does, women of questionable virtue, a fair amount of violence (including a scene in which Scarlett is attacked, and another in which she shoots a Yankee, practically blowing off his face), and Rhett dragging Scarlett up the stairs to ""molest"" her. The MPAA ratings board is nothing if not inconsistent.PPS: Though Vivian Leigh and Hattie McDaniel received Oscars, I consider Butterfly McQueen's performance as Prissy the best in the film. Though she hated the role (it's too easy to interpret Prissy as representing slaves in general, rather than one in particular), she showed great courage in taking it, and delivers a finely nuanced performance.* Max Steiner wrote the first great film score for a talky - ""King Kong"". It epitomizes his style -- ""Mickey-Mousing"" almost every screen action, and the heavy use of Leitmotivs for characters and events. (Note how Melanie's motive appears every time she does, and how Rhett's is played -- breaking the scene's mood -- when he leaves Scarlett for the last time.) He was also the first sound-film composer to underscore almost the entire length of a film -- this is not a recent development. It's worth noting that GWTW, despite some memorable music, did not win ""Best Score"" for 1939 -- Herbert Stothart's for ""Wizard of OZ"" did. I find it considerably more imaginative and appealing.** The Technicolor print uses dye transfer, in which each color is layed down separately from its own gelatin matrix. This allows a great deal of flexibility in controlling the contrast and color balance -- if you're willing to put out the time and money. According to the supplementary material, the color balance /was/ adjusted on scene-by-scene basis for GWTW, just as it is for modern films - that's what the ""color timer"" person does. A high-quality print from 1939 was found, and guided the restorers in adjusting color balance."	5.0	"""And you, miss, are no lady!"""	2009-11-17	322	299	23

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A1ON8BSKNP108Q	"W. Patch ""Audiophile"""	"The regular remasterings of Gone with the Wind mark the progress of film restoration, and the 2009/10 releases are no exceptions.  Although not as big a jump as the 2004 edition was over the 2000, the new edition is improved by a significantly better digital transfer of the same 2004 restored elements (the 2004, using the computerized frame fill-in and matching of the Technicolor elements, is not likely to be improved upon).  Most versions of the newest edition, both regular DVD and Blu-ray, were released in November, 2009. The ""Scarlett Edition"", issued in April of this year, is supposed to have a higher bit-rate, somewhat better transfer, but trying to note differences is probably cutting it too fine.The new edition comes in basically three packages: a two-disc DVD or one-disc Blu-ray of just the movie itself; a three-disc DVD of the movie and the making of it or a two-disc Blu-ray of the movie and all the extras (the making- of, the cast bios, and the made-for TV shorts); and a five-disc DVD (either the Ultimate Collector's Edition of 2009 or Scarlett Edition of 2010)of the movie and all the extras or a three-disc Blu-ray, which includes all the extras and ""MGM: When the Lion Roars"", a history of the studio, on the third disc.  The five-disc Ultimate Collector's or Scarlett DVD set has the same four discs included with the 2004 edition (the two-disc movie, the making-of disc and the cast-bio disc; all worthwhile - see other reviews) plus a fifth disc with very entertaining shorts: the documentary ""1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year"" and the ""Scarlett O'Hara War"", a made-for-TV, ""Hollywood-insider"" story of the casting of Scarlett.  For the small added price of the five-disc DVD/three-disc Blu-ray, they are the ones to own.As an idea of the improvement of the new edition over previous ones, whereas the 2004 edition close-ups of Ms. Leigh showed the lines added to her face to age her, the new edition shows the moles and other imperfections of her skin! (I should qualify: as both are upscaled by a Toshiba HD DVD to 1080p/24fps and viewed on a Sony XBR at the 24fps, which is notably better).  The opening take of the leaves on the lawn of the Selznick studios are now sharply outlined leaves, not specks of brown.In comparing the upscaled DVD version to a borrowed Blu-ray, the superior power of the Blu-ray processor shows up  mainly during the action sequences.  When the senior O'Hara rides his prized white horse across the countryside, the sequence stays clearly outlined on the Blu-ray but blurs on the DVD.  Little difference shows up, however, during stills and slow sequences, when most of the dialog/story is delivered.  Unless you have the newest surround sound, the more advanced Dolby and DTS of the Blu-ray will not be playable (if you have only two-channel, you are better off setting the movie disc to ""Original Mono"" in the ""Special Features"" section; otherwise, the down-mix of the multi-channel will sound tinny/worse than the mono).With the 75th, ""Diamond Anniversary"" of ""GWTW"" only five years away, no doubt we will see another new and improved edition.  How many editions will we buy?  As many as they make; it was the landmark in filmmaking in 1939 and remains a landmark in restoration today."	5.0	As many times as they show it	2010-06-28	16	14	2

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	AJ9HPQXE8NE76	Zachary Tokie	The transfer from analog to digital was great. I was amazed with the quality of the picture on such an old movie. When I ordered it I was expecting grainy horrible picture but it was actually really good. It was also a great movie even before blu-ray when the picture was hard to tell what was happening. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone I meet. If your looking for a great movie for your whole family to watch you should buy this.	5.0	I love gone with the wind on blu-ray	2011-01-13	7	5	2
6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	"""Gone With the Wind"" is one of the most famous stories to ever grace the big screen. Clarke Gable and Vivien Leigh gave truly oscar worthy performances. The direction and the cinematography for this film is so powerful in this film, so it's no wonder why this movie is a classic. Although the movie is a bit long and paced, its still a must see movie for anyone who loves dramas. The story is basically about a young girl's survival around the civil war period and some of her misfortunes that she confronts. The story has all the elements of a great film like betrayal, lust, love, and so much more. This movie is a prime example of great film making, so I only wish that most modern films could be just as captivating. With such famous rememorable scenes like when Clarke Gable says at the end to Vivien Leigh, ""Quite frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."" is truly one of the more powerful scenes (and most quoted) in film history. Overall, anyone who loves movies as much as I do will love this one."	4.0	Gone With The Wind	2005-02-24	5	2	3

6305123616	Gone With the Wind [VHS]	A23Z7O96XAL16D	Zippidydo	"I cannot believe the amazing quality Warner has brought to this deluxe GWTW set. It's been worth the wait. The picture and sound are amazing and dramatically improved. The extras are sumptuoua and lavishly presented, best of all, a new personal conversation between ""you, the audience"" and the wonderful Olivia de Havilland. She shares her memories of the film in a very personal, endearing way. There also docus on Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable making their DVD debut, tons of trailers & newsreel footage, and EVEN a rarely seen classic MGM short used to teach the audiences about THE OLD SOUTH. Directed by Fred Zinneman.Then you get the massive MAKING OF A LEGEND documentary. Simply Amazing.The cherry on the sundae is the extra deluxe packaging with the 1939 souvenir program reprinted inside. I got one of these for myself (a little early!) but I'm ordering a bunch more as this IS the perefct Xmas gift!As for the film itself, nothing will ever come close to topping it."	5.0	THE GREATEST FILM EVER IS NOW THE BE ALL & END ALL DVD	2004-11-02	12	9	3

No fault of the CD, of course.The charactrers are not very likeable but, perhaps, that was what made the sgtory a winner.	3.0	Gone with the Wind	2012-11-14	2	0	2
