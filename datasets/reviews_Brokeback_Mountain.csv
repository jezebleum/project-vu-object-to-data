1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1ALOIPRR8Q06J	"2 cents ""meaningless memes"""	"A couple years ago I was staying with family that has digital cable. Let me digress: Ever read _Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business_by Neil Postman? It's worth checking out. Anyway, I was hanging around the house a lot and this movie was playing on the HBO channels. At first I wasn't too interested to be honest. You know, seemed it might be a liberal Hollywood ""message movie"" and the subject matter didn't particularly appeal to me. I mean romance movies aren't my thing anyway and one about two dudes is just not my cup of tea. And there was so much buzz around it cause it's the ""gay cowboy movie"" and people are retarded and trip, in large part because of the very entertainment industry TV shows and magazines that are mainly responsible for generating the publicity for Hollywood products. But I started catching parts of it when I was hanging out channel surfing and ended up seeing the whole thing. ANYWAY, this is a very good movie, plain and simple. I was moved by it alright? I mean it got to me. And I made a point to tell friends. It bothered me that I felt even slightly funny about telling people I know that I liked the movie. I called BS on myself.The motivation for writing this here Amazon ""review"" for BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is Heath Ledger's performance.Seeing Ledger in this role it was perfectly clear to me at the time that Ledger was going to be one of his generation's finest actors. I've heard from fanboys a million times over how awesome Ledger's performance as The Joker is and it really is an amazing performance and I completely agree. However, long before ever seeing THE DARK KNIGHT I knew Heath Ledger was going to be a superstar. I knew well before ever even seeing a clip of him as The Joker he was going to be great as The Joker solely based on his performance in this film and that THE DARK KNIGHT would make him a star.I'd also add that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a much better pictire than CRASH which won for ""Best Picture"" that year. Ang Lee is a truly great drama film director. ICE STORM and RIDE WITH THE DEVIL are also great and unique films. The tribute below is touching and I think perfectly articulates what so many have thought and felt..___________________________________________________________________""Ledger's magnificent performance is an acting miracle. He seems to tear it from his insides. Ledger doesn't just know how Ennis moves, speaks and listens; he knows how he breathes. To see him inhale the scent of a shirt hanging in Jack's closet is to take measure of the pain of love lost.Rare is the performance that can honestly be called a ""revelation,"" but that's what it felt like to watch Heath Ledger in ""Brokeback Mountain."" Not only did he bring iconic life and nuance to the existential loneliness of Ennis Del Mar, a taciturn but complex (and conflicted) character, but for such mature work to spring from the teen-idol star of ""10 Things I Hate About You"" and ""A Knight's Tale"" was... well, revelatory itself -- the astonishing revelation of a suddenly, fully developed actor whose juvenile efforts scarcely hinted he'd be capable of such moving depth and clarity. Ledger emerged as if from a cocoon, gleaming with promise and flexing his wings.Only two years after he received his first Oscar nomination for this iconic, star-making performance, it seems unthinkable that we should be mourning his death, at the age of 28....""-- outstanding film critic Jim Emerson.Couldn't say it better."	5.0	You want to talk about great acting?	2008-08-29	8	7	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1O005WUQUF1K9	Aaron Scott	Okay--I LIVE in Wyoming, and first off, there are just too many cowboy hats. Here is a great irony: this movie tries to overcome stereotypes about gays, when the movie is 80% stereotype itself (read on--I still loved it--I just want to set the record straight).  It's so ridiculous.  Did Ang Lee even visit Wyoming?  Or just drive through to Alberta imagining every stereotype possible?  You just don't see that many cowboy hats (admittedly, I wear one, nearly alone among any neighbors or coworkers), whereas in the movie hardly anybody doesn't wear one.  And frankly, I don't know where they got the dialog coach (not from Wyoming, certainly) but few people in Wyoming have discernable accents, either, any more than any western state.  You might hear Spanish accents, Greek, even Italian any place in the state, but not that thick drawl that sounds more like somebody playing an old record too slow.Secondly, though this does not relate to stereotype but my own sense of taste, if Ang Lee had omitted the sex scene--or at least done it with discretion and omitted the nearly pornographic detail--the movie might have been an order of magnitude better.That said: gosh, I love it; I've seen it a bazillion times and even surfeit cannot drive the haunting melancholy from my mind.  I wouldn't recommend it to anybody unless they already knew what they were getting in to--it is by no means a FAMILY movie--but it plucked a strong chord with me.  I bought it as soon as it was out on DVD and have watched it (or portions thereof) nearly every night.  Painful, lovely, haunting--I have a new adjective after every viewing--but, like Jack said, I simply cannot quit it.  I wake in the night with lines or music from it in my mind.  That must say something about the movie!	4.0	Flawed--but unforgetable	2006-05-07	48	25	23
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A23Q68A9OISDZJ	A. Cao	I was expecting some gratuitous gay cowboy flick. The amount of hype Brokeback Mountain received had me shying away. I expected to hate it. I thought I'd be disappointed. I'm a real cynic. I'll admit I actually wanted to hate it because everyone else had raved on so much.In any event I can't deny that I loved it. Without a doubt it is the most beautifully crafted film I have seen (It's reasonable to say I haven't seen that many good movies). The story is artfully told. Heath Ledger's portrayl of Ennis Del Mar was honest and heart felt. You really saw the torment he put himself through trying to deny his love for Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and present an honest, straight, normal persona to his world. Jake Gyllenhaal had to work even harder to give Jack a confidence in himself and an acceptance of his sexuality that Ennis never had. Although Jack's feelings for Ennis where obvious, the fact that he had other lover's made his character humanly flawed. To the film's credit neither character ever mentions love. The acting and direction is so spectacular that you see all the emotion and unspoken words play across each character as clear as if it was spoon-fed. It so rare to be allowed to understand a film's intent without having it rammed down your throat with over acting, dialogue and special effects.This isn't a 'sensation' movie, it doesn't set out to be controversial or political or even to set a standard for the gay community. Ignore all of that and see the movie for what it is. A heart-wrenching tale of unspoken love, denial and human struggle for personal acceptance. It's wonderful and deserves all it's praise for being what it is. No apologies, No expectations. It's almost as if they made it thinking that no one would ever see it. The best word for it is 'Honest'.	4.0	Not what you think	2006-02-24	26	19	7

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AQUU8S55JGY2H	Aco	"This is a superbly haunting film, one so affecting that I woke up in the middle of the night thinking about it. Beautifully acted, directed, scored, shot, located and heart-wrenching, Brokeback Mountain is likely the Best Picture of 2005. Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give career best performances, creating portraits of two men in love, but distinctly different in their capacity to understand and accept what has happened between them, and particularly who they are.Ang Lee is truly one of cinema's best directors, who's deft handling of different genres (American comic book mythology, sublime Chinese martial arts ballet, 70's era suburban East Coast drama, 19th century pastoral English romance, etc.) continues here. He uses the contrasts of stunning wide open space and isolation, physical and internal isolation. The need to battle the elements alone versus together. The attempt to mask and repress the heart with tradition, denying the rebel. There is also much metaphor to express the opposing natures of men and women. For example, Jack's (Gyllenhaal) evolving submission to his father-in-law is developed over a few scenes, ending in a relieving turkey cutting scene that clarifies his maturity and acceptance of himself. But the moving images of Ennis (Ledger) alone, in stoned paralysis are what haunts the film. His disconnect with what he feels propels the story, his fear and uncontrollable passion wreak havoc on others too, but mostly on himself. Ennis is the romantic and the pragmatic of the two, and tortured by a true love he can't accept. While Jack is the flamboyant and hopeful one, who's sexuality he learns to embrace.But homosexuality is secondary in the film. And just as time period is (it starts in 1963 and travels 20 years) important, it represents a time when cowboys (America's mythic man) were dying out; the residents of ghost towns, made up of young guys needing to be their fathers, etc. To which the differences between Ennis and Jack also evolve. One remaining the ranch hand/herder, the other going into business and wealth.But the timelessness of this is primarily in the relationship itself, equally passionate and distant, unable to blossom in an intolerant world, but especially in a fearful one.For the culmination of a long term love to be ""I swear,"" left me knowing that even when I can't get out of my own way, there is a fight to be had, against the intolerance, fear and torture of a world which masks it's truths with worse fears."	5.0	Powerful, Moving, Beautiful...	2006-01-15	13	9	4
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1V7FLEMLZ3A0I	"Acolin ""Acolin"""	"Director Ang Lee eases into a topic as touchy as Iraq with a gentle approach. A 60s setting, some gorgeous scenery, a methodical, patient pace, yet half way through the movie, you realize that not only are you watching two guys kissing (when was the last time you saw that? Heck, have I ever seen that?), but that they are going to simulate sex (without the genitals) right there on the screen and you, if you are brave enough, are going to sit through it!(I asked my girlfriend to hold my hand. Girls: it takes a real man to see this movie. Let them take you to a horror movie - you get them back and take them to this.)Despite all of these political and sexual asides, this is an awesome movie. I recently saw ""Walk the Line"" again on cable (already!). While it is a wonderful portrayal of Johnny Cash, it is not an stirringly emotional movie like Brokeback Mountain. It is no surprise to me that ""Brokeback"" jokes are already in the vernacular of the day. This movie has a profound impact of our current culture.Heath Ledger and Jake ""G-something-unpronounceable"" do a wonderful job. Though they are on the screen through-out the entire movie, they carry the burden as lightly as a T-shirt. Ledger will never be thought lightweight again. There is more acting here than ""Capote."" There is more emotion here than ""Crash."" This was the best movie of the year.As difficult as homosexual love is to comprehend (for what, the last 2 million years?), this movie makes it real, tangible, tender and poignant. It is story writing, telling and acting at its best. If you like ""Unforgiven"" or ""Million Dollar Baby,"" you will like this movie."	5.0	Best movie of the year	2006-04-12	34	29	5

Watch it again and you will notice things you didn't see the first time-and feel it for days after. I come from a place where there is understanding and I am allowed to be happy, but this was not so for our young lovers in the country in the 60's (and probably today as well). Enis and Jack had the love of a lifetime but never got to live a life together. This story of love (yes they are gay and cowboys-BUT it is a love story) will leave you aching for them long after you turn the ""off"" switch to your dvd player. Please watch this film and tell me you don't feel anything for these two. I do feel cheated that the Academy didn't feel it was the best film of 2005, but I will take the other 65 organizations that say it was (including the Hollywood Foreign Press, DGA, PGA, WGA and so on) and know this film will go down as one of the greatest ever-AFI will have it on the list someday.

Truly, the scenery is spectacular, and the story moves along at a nice pace, just like a good horse - or so I believe would be true with a good horse.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1LTJD7WTF8H4Z	Adagio Farm	Fascinating. While Ang Lee films are always artful and beautiful, this particular film was worth the watching for the breathtaking cinematography alone.  The romantic landscape is inexorably intertwined with the love story, which is dramatic, poignant and yes, quite romantic.  This storyline plays like the 21st century version of Romeo and Juliet: Characters Ennis, a ranch hand, and Jack, a rodeo bull rider, are essentially products of the American West. In the changing world of the 1960s, they work hard to remain working cowboys, a life they love. They meet herding sheep on a mountain, and despite their respective insistence that each is not homosexual, and with some degree of self loathing, these tough guys fall in love.  Of course, theirs is love that can never be publicized.  Given the conflicting traditional values of Americana societal constraints, they become star-crossed lovers. The story spans a period of twenty or so years, depicting the secrecy with which the men, both of whom marry and raise families, must lead double lives.  This film transcends the surface layer of a gay lover story, indeed it shatters the entire structure of what we consider to be romantic love.  If you have ever had a love that can never be made public or a love never fully realized, you identify with this film. I would guess that even if you are homophobic, you may yet secretly hope these two cowboys will end up together on their own ranch.  Watching this fim, I was reminded of `Lonely are the Brave' (Kirk Douglas, 1963) for understanding the heart of a cowboy, yet also the more widely-known `The Bridges of Madison County' for the portrayal of a life-sustaining love never completely realized. Do set aside all you thought you knew about romantic love before you watch Brokeback Mountain. What an impressive film. A very risky film. A standout.	5.0	Poignant. Dramatic.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A296HOCXHFHG23	"adipocea ""poceaadrian"""	"What some guys don't understand about this movie, considering it flat and a big ""let down"", is that Brokeback Mountain doesn't follow the rule of traditional storytelling in cinema, praised and analyzed by experts like Bob Mckee, I mean a story with twist and turns, poin of no return, acts, a final and clear message, etc.This is a movie, a story in the tradition of the great literature of the nineteenth century, especially russian, Chekhov or Tolstoy to be more specifically. It's the complete opposite of the storyline from Crash, for example(a movie that might win the Oscar, against the odds, exactly because is against the odds and it will be a huge campaign for not voting Brokeback Mountain but voting Crash from now on).I mean, here, in Brokeback, if someone tells you some words about the story, there are no surprises. You know from the beginning that this guys are going to meet there, make sex, fall in love, and keep their relantionship for 20 years. A down ending and period. No twists, no turns, no surprises. But this is the point here, that is why Brokeback Mountain is a great movie.Brokeback Mountain is  how life it is, how real life is. No coincidences here(there are so many and disturbing in Crash), no deus ex machina solutions.The only coincidence is thet these two guys meet there, these particular guys, but this is the amount of coincidence that we have regulary in our life. Remember how we met our loved ones, for all of us it was more or less a coincidence, a thing that IT WAS MEANT TO BE. So that is great about Proulx, but especially for the screenwriters and for Ang Lee, they don't fall for a cheap twist, for a Hollywood like surprise ending, for a gratuitous revelation,kept secret late into the movie.They just show, like Tolstoy in his short stories, like Chekhov, that life is like that. You have a chance to free yourself, to make love a force of nature, you don't take it, you have to take the consequences. That's what Ennis does. Life is a down ending, everybody dies, love comes to you, time passes, you have to give love, to receive it, to get close to a meaning, if there is a meaning at all for life.The philosophy of the movie is just great, first class, at the level of the great literature.The endlees talking about how to define this movie (is it gay, is it more than that, is a love story,etc.) is less important. The important thing about this movie the substance within, the consistence, the groundbreaking attitude of the filmmakers, the great, great attitude of the actors."	5.0	Like the great classics of literature	2006-02-01	23	13	10

All I have to say is that you must have patience and an open mind to understand the story and the struggle between these two gay characters, in love with each other - torn apart by their seperate lives.Don't get me wrong. The cinemetography was great and acting dynamite. But that was it!The disregard Ennis and Jack show to their families is awful AND unfair. I felt more sorry for the wives (especially Ennis's) than the 2 male sheep herders.  ***NOT cowboys***I gave it only 2 stars, after seeing it a second time.

Two actors pretending to be in love, they sure pulled it off effortlessly. Ang Lee's direction is so beautiful with the sheeps, it looks like a cloud floating in one swing. Gorgeous, intense, and courageous acting is what you will get when you engross yourself in this oscar-nominated film.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A371LO7RP9RCOR	"A. Gilbert ""TG5003"""	"The only reason I give Brokeback Mountain 4 stars, is due to Heath Ledger's somewhat overdone accent, which was made a bit worse by the low volume in some of the dialog. I think he did a terrific job.. but he was a bit hard to understand at times. Of course, one could also say (as was in the special features), that his speech was supposed to be almost ""tortured.""I feel that some are misinterpreting the point of showing to gay men ""going at each other's throats,"" and the seemingly violent sex scenes. Yes.... they are rather rough at times. That is the exact point. The characters in this film were repressed... they could not be themselves out of legitimate fear - fear of others, and fear of succumbing to their desires. The fear they had was bottled up for years, especially in Ledger's character, having been exposed to the murder of a gay man at a very young age. Therefore, when they encountered each other - the passion (sex) is seemingly uncontrollable; years of pent up frustration and desire was unleashed at once. This scene was supposed to be ""abrupt,"" and it certainly accomplished the goal.Additionally, considering what ""Ennis del Mar"" was exposed to as a child, it is not at all surprising that his anger and frustration would reflect itself in physical violence towards the love he felt he could not have. I feel this is VERY common amongst gay men who were molded into a stereotypical ""macho"" lifestyle when growing up. Add to that, being a Cowboy in Wyoming in the 1960's - well, you have a recipe for pretty much everything that was in the movie. I feel the depiction of the character, and Ledger's performance of this role, were right on target.I will also add, that the supposed ""shocking"" and ""unnecessary"" sex scene in the tent was no more ""graphic"" than any other rated R movie sex scene - in fact, I would say it was rather tame in comparison. I think what some have found disturbing, is the sudden passion, and aggression shown, which is explained above. Saying this scene was ""graphic"" is a double standard. Uncomfortable for some viewers, perhaps. But, that is the point.As for the acting of the others - I was a bit dissapointed with Anne Hathaway's job; I thought she was a bit contrived, or otherwise reserved in her emotions. But to be fair, her character wasn't given much of an opportunity to shine. Michelle Williams on the other hand, did a perfect job. The one scene when Ennis is grabbing her arm in the kitchen had me in fear! Her portrayal of a confused/angry and fearful (of the truth) wife, was excellent."	4.0	EXCELLENT movie, that some are misinterpreting	2006-04-13	25	16	9
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3GKU0NILLHDWQ	A. Hickman	"There is absolutely nothing left to say about this film that hasn't already been said.  Yet I feel compelled to add my five cents, if only because of the slight it received at the Academy Awards.  Simply put, this is the most important American film of the past twenty-five years.  It is provocative, it is breathtakingly beautiful, and it is flawlessly acted, but it is also a movie with a heart, and I defy anyone with the sensitivity of a snail not to be moved by Jack and Ennis' tragic love story.  The movie has received its share of criticism, but bear in mind that most of that has come from people who refuse to see the film.  I'm including Tony Curtis and Ernest Borgnine, among other Academy voters, who allowed their bigotry to stand in the way of their seeing the film.  They cast their votes in ignorance.  Go figure.  But none of that has stopped ""Brokeback"" from becoming possibly the most honored film in the history of cinema.  It has won fourteen Best Picture awards that I know of, beginning with the Vienna Film Festival Award and including the recent GLAAD Award for best picture.  It is a film that will continue to be viewed and studied, both for pleasure and for pure love of cinema for decades to come.  I place ""Brokeback"" in the same category as ""Romeo and Juliet"" or ""La Traviata""--one of the great love stories of all time.  As Emmy Lou Harris sings on the sound track, ""A Love that Will Never Grow Old.""  Hats off to Ang Lee, to Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossawa, and to Heath and Jake, but a special bow to Annie Proulx, whose short story started it all, when it originally appeared in the New Yorker magazine in 1997.

Petrucelli	It's out, it's about and it's still a moving love story.Unless you broke your back and have been incommunicado or living off in the vast wilderness on some mountain, you've heard much - perhaps too much - about this film. But Ang Lee's groundbreaking film, as much about the restraints of role-playing and societal expectations as the angst and amore between two itinerant male ranchers, deserves, deserves repeated looks. Seeing the film on a small(er) screen works for and against the movie; the haunting sadness that permeates the tale is a tangible, claustrophobic ache; the awesome expanse of the outback is reduced to screen-saver souvenirs. The acting is subtle and superb; we are consistently drawn to the subtly nuanced performance of Michelle Williams.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2TFG9059TWQY3	"Alfredo Torres ""booklover"""	"In the years since I've seen this film I have held a quiet dislike for it that was hard for me to voice, particularly due to the fact that so many of my friends admire it.  It has much to like, I think: the acting, the pacing, the themes, cinematography, great story, etc.  However, as a gay man, my personal reaction to it was that it was disingenuous--that this film is not true to life, that it was incredible and unconvincing in that it does not agree with what I know to be true about love between people and love between men.When two people love each other, and when that love is a great love, like the one depicted in this film, that love gives courage and enables the lovers to overcome certain obstacles, like fear.  In this movie that doesn't happen.  Mind you, it is not that I am addicted to happy endings.  I was not, at the outset, hoping for the two lovers to end up together and happy like in straight soap operas.  I expected them to be together because my own logic led me to that conclusion.  I thought, well, if their love is that great and strong, they'll find a way.  The love between the two men had that quality of greatness that, naturally, would lead me to think that way.  When that did not happen, and the men never really come together, never overcome their fear, it just didn't seem real or true to me.  Either their love was really not that great, or the story is lying at some level.Let me tell you, when two closeted gay or bisexual men in their situation (married to women) fall in love, they can and do find ways to be together.  One of the most common ways of doing so is by going into business.  A business partnership between two men can become an unofficial marriage, granting the men ample time together and also many opportunities for traveling in each other's company for business related reasons and pretexts like: business conferences and fairs, meetings with investors, business expansion endeavors, etc.  Men in such a partnership can hope to enjoy a high degree of marital closeness, even though they have to be discreet about it.  Watching this film, I remember having the expectation that at some point the lovers would go into business together and manage to stay close to each other that way.So, when the lovers do not come together, yes it was disappointing, and for a long time my mind searched for a reason why because the reasons given in the story were unconvincing--even untruthful.  And finally, I struck on what may be the answer--director Ang Lee's Chinese cultural background, with it's eastern philosophical tenets of individual self-sacrifice for the social order and a nebulous ""greater good.""  Is the subtext here, I wondered, that gay love does not serve the ""greater good,"" and is the greater good equated with the social order and, by extension, mysteries? Sacredness? God?  You must admit, the characters possessed a great reluctance and fear to upset society.  The whole idea of a great love that existed but was not known nor acknowledged by anyone outside of the two lovers, is a concept that is very Asian--the lovers who cannot consummate their love because society forbids it, and that there is something spiritually beautiful in that abnegation of their love.  There are Chinese folktales that run like this, and it is this very type of romanticism that I find both disagreeable and dishonest.  Because the fact is that every single day, human beings have to find ways to subvert the social order in order to snatch some of the rewards of life for themselves, and they are also often successful in doing just that.  The failure of these lovers to do just that is incredible, untruthful, and dishonest, and does not serve any mysterious and deceptive ""greater good.""It is worth noting here that the lovers in the film are not cowboys by mere accident.  They are cowboys because the cowboy is one of the chief and most respected stereotypes of masculinity in America, and as such they make a convincing pitch for the heartstrings of those who believe in that stereotype, in John Wayne and the Marlboro man.  Imagine for a minute if the lovers in ""Brokeback"" had not been cowboys but instead had been truckers, or better yet, beauticians.  Could viewers have taken their love as seriously?  I don't think so.  The movie hinges on the idea that the cowboy-lovers are ""real"" men, and that it is the love between two ""real"" men that the story is about.  Why?  Well, to augment it's subtle but devastating insult to gay men.  It says to gay men that they are not men, that they are something less--because they do not conform to trite masculine stereotypes.  And the clincher is that the moviegoer is complicit in this insult because, if the movie had been about the love affair between two male hairdressers, far less people would have cared to see it.I resent this movie because it represents a great put-down of gay men and of gay love.  It suggests that love between ""real"" men is not really possible, even as the ""real"" men in question are mere stereotypes.  It insults gay men by refusing to acknowledge their manhood.  It is ridiculous in it's belittlement of gay love because it suggests that even when that love is great, gay lovers are incapable of asserting and establishing that love and that closeness in some way, even subversively.  In the end, you may believe whatever you want to believe, but when men really love each other they find ways to be together, whether they are closeted married cowboys or high-powered businessmen.  And the social order be damned."	1.0	Where there's love, there's a will, and where there's a will, there's a way	2011-02-13	52	18	34

Someone made a comment to me about how far we have come since the 1960's when this story took place. I made quick to say that had we really? Look at Matthew Shepard. This movie shows you that despite what the world thinks is right or wrong, it's about loving someone. That love can survive alot of things. I think that anyone who sees it will not be disappointed and that each person will get something different out of the story. It is very deservant of the attention and nominations it is receiving.

Ang Lee's director award is well-deserved.  It will be a classic of its kind in 10 years.There were a few glitches in the film, though: Gyllenhaal's aging process needed more work, especially towards the end of the film when he was supposedly 20 years older.  In the scene where they had their last fishing trip, when Jack saw Ennis riding off on horseback, he had a full mustache.  Then there was a 2-second close up on his face, which became clean-shaven.  When it cut to the frame where Jack leaned on his car seeing Ennis off, the mustache was back.The movie's sound track was minimalist. A nice score or memorable theme song would help attract more audience at the box office - this is just my opinion.  It is a great film as it stands.	4.0	Future Classic	2006-01-30	13	5	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A39IBJB2PBVC7I	Alistair McHarg	"Brokeback Mountain has certainly given rise to a wave of homophobic jokes, reflecting a national nervousness about the subject, especially when applied to that most archetypically male American activity, cowboy life.  Ironically, there should be no surprise whatever that male-dominated societal enclaves like the military, the clergy, and the State Department are rife with homosexuality, no matter how secretive or repressed.  But this is not even the point of Brokeback Mountain, which is not a ""gay cowboy movie"" any more than Jaws is a fishing movie.Brokeback Mountain is a love story, specifically a story of forbidden love, and the horrifying emotional toll such a situation takes.  As with Legends Of The Fall, the real hero is Wyoming, Ang Lee has given us a loving, idyllic vision of the American West that seems to glow with purity and splendor.  (Let's protect it!)  Texas does not get off quite so easily, few people know better than writer Larry McMurty how god-awful flat, dry, and just plain miserable it is.  As to Annie Proulx, (just can't bear to add that affected E. in front of her name), whose story provided the foundation for the film, what can one say except that - wherever you find humanity's saddest qualities, darkest despair, and most senselessly cruel and violent tendencies, there you will find Ms. Proulx!  That's the spirit, Annie!Ledger's performance is haunting; his hurt seems to rise off him like steam.  Gyllenhaal, a terrific actor with a name that's hard to spell, is also outstanding, although his western twang does seem suspect at times.  Great supporting work by the wives.  Michelle Williams, as Alma Del Mar, is every bit as injured and silent as her husband, trapped and very sympathetic.  Anne Hathaway, as the Texas heavy equipment Princess, is perfection; there is a toughness to her that's very believable.The hype surrounding Brokeback Mountain was unfortunate, but inevitable.  Viewers who are able to put their homophobia in park for a couple of hours will discover a masterfully crafted film about two individual human beings attempting to find love in a world exquisitely designed to deny them access to it.  No matter what part of town you're from, that's always a heartbreaker."	5.0	This Headline Eschews Tawdry Innuendo	2006-06-23	41	34	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3UK94ZNVID1Q1	"aljohnpa ""John"""	Both my parents were Pentecostal ministers.  My father was gay and my mother's mission in life was to save/change him.  At one point around the age of 14 or 15 I babysat for my father's boyfriend's son. My father died a deeply depressed, broken unfulfilled man still blaming my mother for protecting me from him and preventing our relationship.  The marriage was what they thought God wanted... a marriage of duty not love.  I came out to my parents at 18.  My father knew I was gay but never sat and talked honestly with me about his situation.  Around the age of 26 I became depressed and my mother swooped in hoping to succeed where she had failed with my father and talked me into entering a (teen challenge) sponsored program that claimed they could change gay men.  For one year I worked hard, did as I was told, read or viewed nothing from the outside, memorized scripture, abstained from sex of any kind, fasted for 11 days while cooking for 16 people and prayed.  After one year they told me I was changed and released me into the world.  I was being encouraged to marry a girl from my parent's church but no one asked if we were in love.  After a few months of honest reflection I ended the relationship and went on my way to live my life as intended.Gay people are accused of having an agenda.  Just read the above and tell me honestly who really has the agenda.  The gay agenda is to end the lies, hate, bondage, brutality and destruction.I went to see Brokeback  Mountain last weekend.  At first I was stunned... then overwhelmed with sadness as I saw my father's life decisions repeated in front of the world.  The sadness turned to empathy and understanding of the terrible anguish my father went through trying to change.  My thoughts then turned to my mother's pain caused by her misguided mission of beating her head against the stone wall of my father's orientation.  Again the sadness set in as I realized what a destructive force this misguided agenda to suppress gays is to entire families.  Then I felt something lift from me realizing that so many people would see the destructive forces at play in our society.  The rug is being lifted and the dirt of silence and oppression underneath is being exposed.  There was a time when mixed race love was treated the same way.  Thank you E. Annie Proulx, Ang Lee and all those with the courage to be involved with this project.  Thank you for exposing the truth and wreckage.I am 52 now and have been in love with and living with the same man for 27 years.  There are many things the laws and lack of equal rights deny us but nothing can keep us from loving each other.  Jack Twist was right... It is possible to be gay, in love and happy.	5.0	Gay agenda... what exactly does that mean?	2006-01-25	63	59	4
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A31PH3B7AHFHCS	Alka	"I first saw this movie in January and still can not get it out of my mind. I see lots of movies that get great reviews and sometimes they're deserved and sometimes not. I admit I didn't immediately see how great this movie was at first. I didn't cry at all and came out of the cinema confused, not sure of what I had seen, and wondering things like: why did Ennis punch Jack on that last day on the mountain? how did Jack actually die? where did the shirts come from? Then surprisingly I found myself thinking about the movie over the next few days so I decided to read the story, which cleared up some things, and went to see the movie again. This time the true greatness of the movie really hit me and I cried a lot. I think this is really a rare case where all the stars aligned in terms of story, directing, acting, music, cinematography, etc. I'm really glad I didn't read the story until I'd after I'd seen the movie so it was all new to me. I truly had no expectations beyond knowing that it was about a relationship between two men.I'm also really glad I wasn't living in the US and having to deal with the hype and constant jokes. Thankfully there was none of that in the UK. This is not a movie about ""gay cowboys"". When asked what drew Ennis and Jack together, Heath Ledger said in an interview that he felt that Ennis' soul fell in love with another soul, and that soul came in the form of a man. I think that's right on target, because Ennis never seemed interested in anyone after Jack, not in other men, his wife, or the waitress. Jack and Ennis were very lonely people and that only changed when they were together. They had very similar backgrounds and it's sad to think that this was probably their first real friendship. It's striking that during those four years they're apart, one time that they're clearly thinking of each other is when the issue of loneliness comes up, even though neither is alone at the time. How can anyone think their relationship was about lust? They carried on for 20 years and Jack drove 14 hours each way just to see Ennis a few times a year...a lot of trouble for just a few rolls in the hay. I admit the first time I saw this movie the love between them wasn't so obvious and the first tent scene mostly seemed to come out of nowhere, but after repeated viewings and paying close attention the love is very clear. These are very undemonstrative people and they are not going to be giving each other candy and flowers and declaring their love. But scenes such as Ennis holding Jack from behind in front of the fire and humming make the love blazingly clear, I frankly wish it had gone on as long as suggested in the story!And that's heartbreaking and the reason I think this movie has stayed with me for so long. You see them at the beginning, 19 years old with their lives ahead of them, and you see them become frustrated and sadder and going through the motions in life with the passing years, and 20 years later one is dead and the other is doomed to be alone and full of regret the rest of his life. You don't have to be gay or a cowboy or even a man to understand this movie. I am none of those things. I think everyone can understand being lonely and question whether they've made the right choices in life or will be full of regret at the end. You hope you'll find that one person your soul connects with and not end up alone. However, this story absolutely needs to take place between two men and I don't understand how people can say that this story could take place between a man and a woman. The point is that Ennis hates himself for being in love with another man and that's why he makes him and Jack live the way they do. Yet although they talk about their relationships with women, he goes ballistic at the thought of Jack sleeping with other men. Jack probably knows this, and I think this is why at their last meeting Jack says he's carrying on with the ranch foreman's wife rather than the ranch foreman, and rather sadly jokes about being shot by Lureen or her husband. Ennis learns the truth after Jack dies from Jack's father and finally has to realize that he may have finally driven Jack away.I have only one complaint about the story. Many people have said they like the scene at the end where Alma Jr. comes to tell Ennis she's getting married, but I don't. This scene isn't in the story and I think it was an attempt to make the audience feel a bit more hopeful that Ennis has changed because he decides to quit his job and go to the wedding. In the book Ennis is alone and haunted by dreams of Jack the rest of his life, which I find far more believable considering that he's full of regret, although even more heartbreaking than the movie's ending if that's even possible.Though I don't particularly like country music, I did buy the soundtrack for the score but was disappointed that it contains so little of it. I hope they release the rest of the score and some of the other music mentioned in the credits. Although I've bought the DVD, I'd gladly buy a director's cut with commentary, deleted scenes, etc. The trailer contains some scenes that were not in the movie such as a scene where Ennis and Jack are in a car together. I'm surprised that the trailer wasn't on the DVD, that's fairly common. Being able to watch the DVD with subtitles is great because I realized that I missed some dialog even though I saw it in the cinema many many times, notably during the second tent scene."	5.0	Still on my mind months later	2006-05-01	67	59	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3NQU1649SH0Q4	"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,"""	"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is one of the outstanding films of 2005, a year full of outstanding films.  Based on a 1997 short story by Annie Proulx, the film follows twenty years in the lives of two impecunious Wyoming ranch hands, Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhall) as they meet pasturing sheep in the uplands, fall in love, become intimate sexually, and then try to face a world back down on the flatlands that does not tolerate ""queer"" nor recognize ""gay.""**SPOILERS** Their attempts to have a socially acceptable adult life--in essence a double life--yet stay true to themselves is doomed, and the film shows us how the relationship breaks down slowly over the years between 1963, when the two men meet, and the early eighties, when, already estranged, Ennis learns that his lover was killed on a desolate Texas highway.  The early scenes between the two men are idyllic and gracious, lovely and passionate, and I doubt Wyoming from its mountains to its ""Big Sky"" country has ever been better photographed for a film.But Ennis is already engaged to be married, and after a couple of years is saddled with a wife, two children and a drudge job that leaves him very little time to spend with Jack.  Jack himself, while riding the rodeo circuit, meets a beautiful and charming young woman whose father happens to be rich; the two marry and Jack moves to Texas.  This is not a ""same time next year"" kind of movie but one that shows a deteriorating relationship in which the participants blame themselves for its undoing, not their restrictive and at times brutal society, which at one point literally ropes up ""gay"" by the genitals and drags it to death.**For all its heartbreak, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a lean movie whose stunning vistas are matched only by flawless performances, including not only Ledger and Gyllenhall but Randy Quaid as the men's intolerant boss and Ann Hathaway (she of ELLA ENCHANTED!) as Jack's increasingly cynical wife.I must admit I'm confused by the reviewers who found no legitimate love relationship in this film between Ennis and Jack.  IMHO I found the sexual tension between the two men quite believable, just as believable as the one true sex scene portrayed in the film, a hurried fumble in the close confines of a pup tent on a stormy high-prairie night.  (I am reminded of sex researcher C.A. Tripp, who commented on the ""explosive"" nature of men-on-men sex in THE HOMOSEXUAL MATRIX and other works.)  But to say there is no love?  The two men roughhouse and nuzzle, skinny-dip and cuddle, and generally show their affection in both tough and tender ways.  In other words, they acted like men.  The scene where Ennis and Jack first part company shows Ennis literally collapsing in rage and pain, beating his fists raw against a wooden barn door, as though his innards had been ripped out.  Ladies and gents, this is not the action of a peeved youth upset because he needs a new source of nookie; this is love!  To me the movie owes its restrictive censorship rating more to the language than anything else, as the two men in true cowboy fashion pepper their language with the f-word and the s-word in their many varieties.This is a movie to recommend not just to people who like good movies but to the occasional soul who asks me or my friends, ""Why make such a big deal about being gay?  Why not just live your life and get on with it?""  BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN shows the impossiblity of living in the closet with dignity, and the brutal consequences of trying to live so in 1963--the devastation not only reaches homosexuals but those who love them such as divorced spouses and confused children.  Much of the homophobia in this film still exists today, but thank God it isn't still 1963!"	5.0	Simply Outstanding	2006-01-01	31	24	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A35HT867PTTRFS	Allen Smithy	"I am so tired of reading/hearing criticisms about this film having centralized ""gay"" characters.  And stop calling it a ""gay movie.""  A movie cannot be gay.  Unless it conducts in sexual activities with other gay movies.If homosexuality is a problem for you, then why even waste your time critiquing this film?  But if you can get past it, this film is not about being gay; if anything, other themes of love, loss of innocence, and survival are much more pronounced.Clearly, this was an Oscar favorite for good reason.  Its directing and cinematography are flawless, and the acting could not be better.  It is true that (as many have mentioned) parts of it can be slow at times; however, it only adds to the laconic feel of the film's setting (which is crucial to the film's central themes and symbols).  And if you read the original writing of Annie Proux, you will see that this film stays true to  the original story (which any good movie should, when it is based on a writing piece).  But, perhaps more importantly, it can feel slow because it is a reflection of real life.  Life is not a collection of well-scripted coversations with things happening constantly.  Life can be, at times, slow and boring- and Ang Lee did an excellent job of portraying real people, in real life, falling in love.For me, this was the best movie of 2005 even if it lost to Crash for the Oscars.  The sadness of this film stayed with me for days after I watched this film, which I certainly did not anticipate with any movie.  Love it or hate it, this film stirred up a lot of attention.  It made a powerful statement about humanity and intolerance that still echoes in our society today.

The night I saw the film, I did not sleep well; my dreams were haunted by the losses experienced by Ennis DelMar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). The following day, they stayed with me.The film, based on the 1997 New Yorker story of Annie Proulx, throws Ennis and Jack together on Wyoming's fictional Brokeback Mountain where they guard sheep for the summer of 1963. The rancher who hires them, a distant relative of Jack, discovers their liaison, terminates their work earlier in the season than planned, and refuses to hire Jack again the next year.But that doesn't end the relationship. Desperate, Jack four years later sends Ennis a postcard and the lovers soon begin meeting for ""fishing"" weekends and week-long vacations at Brokeback.In 1963, of course, life was far more complicated for gay men than today. Even in the big cities, there was no gay rights movement. But in the countryside and west, things were far more tenuous indeed. Lest this point is unclear, viewers witness Ennis' flashback as he recounts the time his father dragged him by the hand to view the dead body of a gay rancher, murdered and mutilated for his sins.Jack and Ennis are enough in love to periodically cast aside their heterosexual pretenses and families and to reunite in the wilderness setting closest, along with one another, to their hearts. But they are not enough in love to permanently eschew traditional lives and set out in life together, whatever the cost.Like other reviewers, I too have heard women complain about the infidelity of Jack and Ennis to their respective wives, and their consequent ""immorality."" What disturbed me much more was their refusal to openly admit their love and act upon it in a meaningful way.Heath Ledger needs no more recognition for his startling portrayal of the conflicted Ennis. For me, he reembodied a Texan friend who died of AIDS many years ago. His refusal to accept his feelings also revived my memories of and sadness for heterosexual men who were equally unable to commit themselves --- which in a few cases I believe caused ill health, and even early death.But Jake Gyllenhaal also did a superb job portraying his personal difficulty and ambivalence.--Alyssa A.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3EBHHCZO6V2A4	"Amaranth ""music fan"""	"""Brokeback Mountain"" was a breakthrough in mainstream American cinema. It's the first (relatively) mainstream movie to address gay issues, and to treat a gay romance the same way as a straight one. In fact,the poster/CD cover of the leads was purposefully modeled on the one for ""Titanic."" Unlike ""Titanic"",however,""Brokeback"" brings up important issues,has great depth,and is emotionally moving.Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) goes to the mountains of Wyoming for sheep herding. There,he meets Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal),and there's a spark between them. For a time,they enjoy a pastoral and amorous idyll. Soon,their paradise is lost. Both Ennis and Jack marry. They have children. They reunite every summer, their time together bittersweet. Apart from each other, Ennis and Jack break down. Ennis' marriage ends in divorce. Jack carries on an affair with another cowboy,and also has a one night stand with a Mexican prostitute. Jack has hopes for a life with Ennis-but Ennis is afraid. In the end, Jack is murdered in a gay-bashing,and Ennis lives a life mourning ""the road not taken."" Ledger is excellent as the emotionally uptight Ennis,while Gyllenhaal is heartbreaking as the hopeful Jack.""Brokeback Mountain"" is hardly ""homosexual propaganda"" (as LifeSite has called it),or an ""attack on masculinity"" (according to DecentFilms) Jack&Ennis;' mutual adultery does devastate their families. It's not the ""adultery without consequences"" that's so often glamorized. The consummation between Jack&Ennis; is disturbing because it looks like a rape--not because it's between two men. The morning after is hardly domestic bliss-Ennis finds a lamb killed by a wolf during the night. Anne Hathaway is amazingly sympathetic as Jack's heartbroken wife.The positive aspects of the movie are the performances of the leads,the powerful soundtrack (Gustavo Santoalalla is great),its beautiful scenery.One can disagree with the movie's message that it's an argument for gay marriage,or that homosexual and heterosexual love are the same,but it stands as a work of an art. As a work of art,it's open to interpretation;it's hardly ""a homosexual propaganda film."" Does it say gay is OK? It depends on the viewer.The ending of ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a tearjerker.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AK0CENM3LUM28	Amazon Customer	"Brokeback Mountain / B00005JOFQ*Spoilers*Somehow I missed watching Brokeback Mountain when it was first released and it's been on my ""Things to Watch"" list forever, and now I'm probably the last person on earth to watch it. Just about anything I can say about this wonderful movie seems woefully superfluous at this point, and yet it seems fair to point out that I'm yet another person taken in by this tragic and touching movie.I'm not usually a big fan of romances and tear-jerkers, largely because my tears are so easily jerked that I'm one of those people who cry during previews (especially theWall-Epreview, *sniffle*), and I can't say that I'm ever likely to return to Brokeback Mountain a second time, but that's not because I didn't enjoy the movie (far from it) but rather because this movie is memorable at a level comparable to searing itself onto one's brain matter. The writing is simply superb, the acting is quite possibly the best I've ever seen, and the plot is both simple and straightforward (forbidden love) while still being incredibly complicated and thought-provoking.It's hard to say what I liked most about this movie. I appreciated that Ledger's character wasn't given an 'easy out' in terms of his almost emotionally abusive behavior towards Gyllenhaal's character. Yes, the movie acknowledges powerfully that Ennis' behavior is driven by a guilt and fear that was instilled in him powerfully at a young age, but though Ennis is a victim, the movie does not insist that we hand him complete forgiveness for his treatment of Jack. Ennis is holding on to Jack because he loves him, and we pity him for being unable to embrace him fully, yet he seems blissfully, willfully blind to Jack's own pain at their near-constant separation, and Ennis is at fault for not making more time for his lover, or at least make his feelings plain and clear enough to ease some of Jack's pain and doubt.I also greatly appreciated the tenderness with which the movie approaches Ennis' wife and her feelings towards her husband's affair. It would have been tempting to cast her as all saint (understanding her husband's needs and accepting it without any feeling on her part) or as a convenient villain (thus making it morally 'acceptable' for Ennis to behave as he does), yet she is neither and the movie is better for it. As a human being, she struggles with her hurt over Ennis' adultery balanced against his steadfastness as a provider and father, if not as a loving husband. Even when her anger boils over, she never loses sight of the fact that she loves Ennis (as the father of her children, if nothing else), and she does not spread the rumors that he fears might literally end his life.I felt that the ambiguity over Jack's death was a careful touch. We are unsure whether the story of Jack's death was merely a cover for the murder Ennis imagines, and whether or not it is a figment of his imagination colors his acceptance of the matter. Was Jack's death a tragic event that he could have prevented by running off with him? Or would running off with him merely have put them both in further danger? It's impossible to say, and it's easy to imagine Ennis tormenting himself with this question for the rest of his life.Like pretty much everyone else on earth, it seems, I deeply recommend Brokeback Mountain for a tragic and touching tale of love and loss.~ Ana Mardoll"	5.0	Touching and Beautiful	2009-06-30	12	10	2

I find that it tells the story of Human love and the fact when that love is forbidden how it affects not only the people in love but all those around them.  It is a terrible thing that people cannot truly express their love for the person they want to and a true tragedy.  This movie is important to see by as many people as possible because I think it moves you to a place deep within your emotions that people need to fill.  The charecters are so inspiring to make you want to do more to better not only yourself and the world around you, but it also has a deeper meaning one I'm still working on exploring.  All I know is that this is the first movie in all of my lifetime of 41 years that has inspired me to a point that I feel paralyzed by emotions.  Never has any movie, book, play, or painting brought so much out of me.  I just want everyone to experience this movie one time.  Joe	5.0	Human Love	2006-02-21	36	26	10

The movie is beautifully shot and very well acted.  Heath Ledger's performance was so powerful that I felt his pain of being in love and not being able to realize the relationship fully and openly.  At the end of the day, this was a deeply moving love story and the characters just happened to be gay.  Anyone who shys away because the film has gay characters is really missing one of the best films in a long time.  I encourage people on the fence about seeing this film to take the leap and go and see it and I am certain there will be no disappointment.  Themes about love and longing are color/gender blind and everyone can relate to them.  I loved the film!!!	5.0	Love Story..Not about being gay or straight	2006-01-26	19	13	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AUZYKPP1H0XNW	"Amazon Customer ""yello"""	"No doubt Ang Lee is a master of the ""Tragedy"".  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,(My Favorite) The Ice Storm and even The Hulk are all studies in human tragedy and sorrow. Ang is the best story-teller around who can actually make us ""feel"" for his protaganists.  All that being said this movie needs to be exposed for what it is, pure homosexual propoganda period which does double duty as a WMD aimed at demolishing masculine icons and imagery. Few serious students of sociology/philosophy/theology would disagree with the premise that masculinity is a threat to homosexuality & feminist ideaology and Ang Lee has been chosen to help lead the attack. (The American Cowboy Film?...of all the backgrounds to tell a story about homosexual love they choose THIS ONE?..not buying the ""Coincidence"" argument)I truly am amazed to watch Hollywood these days and even more amazed at how many people shrug their shoulders as they ignorantly stuff their face with this radical leftist propoganda as if its as normal as watching ""Star Wars"" or  ""Rocky"".  Really, Wake up people, Hollywood is frothing at the mouth, running around like penned crazed restless rabid zoo animals.  Every film coming out these days are attacking republicans, Current Presidential Administrations, capitalism, conservatives, traditionalists, christians (Islam & Buddhists are apparently Okay) white men, typical family structures, and anything currently associated with traditional american values. If it is NOT Counter-Culture then it DOES NOT PLAY. As a student of mass media it is amazing to watch. One only has to look at the Academy Award nominees this year as proof.In case you haven't noticed, Hollywood saved their best technical work for stories that promote the following messages, homosexual homewrecking masculinity killing cowboys, a manipulative self centered homosexual author manipulating doomed death row men for his own personal glory, mainstreaming transexuals, a film about ""McCarthyism"" and the ""Noble"" and ""objective"" intentions of the news media (Bwahahah), conspiracy films about collusions between THE EVVVUUULLLLL oil companies and Republican controlled governments, (Hey everyone..the world runs on Oil..its what provides us with energy and power...unfortuneatly we need it to live, I'm all for alternative energy but if we don't have it...people die) AND yet ANOTHER film about racism, and a film that asks hard questions about terrorism.  (Sorry folks MUNICH is the best film of the year period...Spielberg always gets ripped...Saving Private Ryan kicked Shakespere in Love) It is amazing that not too long ago this very ""Academy"" made the Catholic Apologist film ""A Man for All Seasons"" and the excellent ""Chariots of Fire"" best pictures films.Anyways, Brokeback has great cinematogrophy, a great score and good acting..its technically well made.  Its message is horrible.  Its not about ""Love"" a word most people do NOT UNDERSTAND in its many forms.  It is however about self centeredness, which maybe meets the lowest forms of ""Eros"" but neither the definitions of Philos or Agape. Most certainly, are obsession with the self is the current god most people worship in America. Regarding Homosexuality, it has been with us since the dawn of time.  Given that it was never accepted as a ""Norm"" in societies that actually lasted. One must seriously answer the question ""why now""?  Is it because ""Pop Culture"" says so?  Are we enlightened beings because  Will and Grace has something meaningful, wise, and substantive to offer?  Why does approximately 1 to 2 percent of the population get so regularly represented in daily mass media consumption?  Its amazing thought to contemplate.Many self-titled ""Open Minded"" people practice reactionary labeling of people who disagree with the homosexual lifestyle as ""Homophobic"". This is pure Orwellian Thought and Speech Control. It also is a sign of somebody blanketly carrying the torch of somebody else's agenda...(Most likely pop cultures)  There are many hundreds of millions of people practicing religion who do not see homosexual lifestyles compatible with the doctrine of their beliefs. That reality is of equal relevance to the reality of homosexuality and deserves an equal amount of respect. Brokeback wants to mainstream homosexuality because of current pop culture trends.  Metaphorically speaking , if Hollywood and Brittney Spears is where we turn to get answers to life's questions we are in serious trouble.  Hopefully we can treat each other with respect whilst this experiment which was ignited in the sixities plays out until its bitter end. It will be interesting to watch Hollywood push their little agenda at the oscars...when Munich is the best film of the year."	2.0	Pure Propoganda by an absolute Master	2006-03-04	130	18	112

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A4F78X2CQCEP9	Ana	"The last thing I expected to find on a Monday night was a small, indie movie theatre sold out of tickets to see what has been termed the ""gay cowboy movie"". Yet, when I went to see Brokeback Mountain last night, I found myself one of the last moviegoers to find a seat in a theatre overflowing with people from all walks of life.Upon first hearing of this movie, I considered it laughable to have an entire film set around two cowboys falling in love, for it seemed, at best, to be a chick-flick with a political agenda. However, my predication's were quickly discarded. This film is much undeserving of it's ""gay cowboy"" stereotype, as it cannot convey the emotional aspect which will inevitably overcome the most callous of moviegoers. For what this movie provides is a heart wrenching tale of two thoroughly complex men, struggling with societal pressures and their desire to be themselves.The story told in this film is of two men, who meet while working one summer herding sheep on top of, what else, but Brokeback Moutnain. Ennis Del Marr (played by Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) find themselves with idle time and only each other to fill it. They spend days riding around on horses and nights sitting around a campfire, talking and drinking whisky. Ennis rarely speaks, and when he does, his words are simple. Jack, on the other hand, is more outgoing in nature. At this time, his spirit seems playful, yet experienced, making for a sharp contrast with that of Ennis. In a surprising turn, for both the viewers and the characters themselves, Jack and Ennis find themselves filled with a primal urges which fuels their first sexual encounter which is void of seduction. They next morning,they both assert that they are not ""queer"", yet continue with the relationship, never speaking of their bond, perhaps because they knew no words to define it. When it comes time for them to part, you can see anguish on both character's faces, believing that they will never see the other again. Both characters marry andestablish families before they meet again. When they find each other four years after their work on Brokeback Mountain, they are instantly drawn together again and establish a relationship where they meet a few times a year, for fishing trips where no fish is ever caught. Their story spans 20 years, culminating in a hauntingly tragic ending.Credit must given to the actors in this film, who truly gave the meaning to each and every character. Much attention should be paid to Heath Ledger, an actor with potential who could never seem to break away from the teen demographic for which his prior films have been marketed. His portrayal of Ennis Del Marr is heartbreaking. With few words, he was able to reveal a array of emotions. With just one look, he could communicate more then words could ever describe. His performance is the reason I cannot get this film out of my mind, a full day since I was present in the theatre. Ledger has found the small intricacies which make this character come to life. The low, rasping voice which seems to come from it's disuse, as well as the slight hunch which hides Ledger's height and conveys his characters venerability. A simple shot of Ledger's soulful eyes can tell the viewers all they need to know about his emotional duress, and will surely leave every onlooker teary-eyed. The way in which he clings to a shirt of Jack's, still upon it's hanger was able to say all that Ennis could not express with words, and was one of the most poignant scenes in the film. In supporting roles, Michelle Williams (as Alma), Anne Hathaway (as Lureen), and Jake Gyllenhaal all do incredible jobs as well, each bringing an intense believability to the roles in which they portrayed. The melancholy nature with which this film concludes, does so, in part because of the exquisite changes each actor brings to their character.It has been a day since I experianced this movie, yet I can still feel it's ramifications churning in the pit of my stomach. The heartache felt by Ennis Del Marr has yet to leave my being, as my mind reels. This film brings to life a story which will not quickly leave me, one which was so realistic in manner I feel almost as if I had experianced it all myself. Do not be quick to write this movie off as just one of ""gay cowboys,"" or a movie with a political agenda. This is a movie with heart, compassion and lose.

I rarely cry in movies, unless they are truly devastating and from when Jack said ""I don't kow how to quit you"" up until the last frame, I was bawling.  This movie was spectacular.  It was less about sex, and more about how the denial of love and of passion slowly corrodes Jack and Ennis from the inside out.  The acting was magnificent, especially Heath Ledger.  When he and Jack were first reunited after 4 years, the smile on his face and his excitement at seeing his old fishing buddy was the cutest thing I have ever seen. He just smoldered through the whole film.

I could not understand how the Academy Awards could miss the opportunity to give the first ""Gay"" Picture an Oscar. All of us can relate to this movie more than ""Crash"". Love. Love is everywhere, no matter what. and this movie teach us that no matter what gender you are, how old you are, or where you are love is going to be there and is impossible to deny it. The movie is set in the early 1960's (when Homosexuality was not ""permitted"".) It shows the love between two straight guys who fall in love after working together up at the mountains and since then their love is meant to be. They both have their own families and their own live, but destiny brings them together and their love is once again revived. They maintain their love a secret for years, but we all know that what they wished for, is that their love can be ""seen"". Believe me when I say that their love and sacrifice for each other will touch you deeply. The movie needs to be watched by men all over the world.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	`Brokeback Mountain' will stand the tests of time, for that I'm certain.  Many would argue that it's only because of it's taboo subject matter or controversy but in the end, after the dust has settled and the smoke has cleared `Brokeback Mountain' is more than just a superlative talking point, it's a monumental powerhouse of a motion picture, from it's brilliant script to it's earth shattering acting to it's award winning directing.  At it's very core `Brokeback Mountain' is a story about life as we see it, live it and need it and it reaches to the heartstrings of much more than would be expected.  This is far deeper than `gay cinema' as some have labeled it but is modern cinema at its finest and teaches valid and life changing points that everyone can learn from despite their orientation and or morality.The film, based of Annie Proulx's short story, centers around the lives of two sheepherders Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist.  The two meet when they are but eighteen, Ennis engaged to his sweetheart Alma and Jack just trying to find himself.  They spend the summer together on Brokeback Mountain, herding sheep and albeit unintentionally falling in love.  The film setting begins in the early sixties and advancing twenty-some-odd-years before its conclusion and throughout the notion of repressed sexual feelings it made apparent. It's not culturally acceptable for these two men to even entertain the idea of loving and or being together, and so after their summer-long affair they go their separate ways, Ennis to marry Alma and Jack to eventually find and fall for Lureen.  Years later, after the births of their children, the memory of their affair still plagues them, not in regret of action but in regret of leaving it alone for so long and so they start up again, rekindling a flame that could only end in tragedy.The film is less a `gay love story' and more a universal cry for love in the most complex of terms.  This film proves that you can't pick the one you love but that the thoughts and feelings of those around us, whether it be close family, friends or the idea of a culture in whole can and will affect our decisions to whom and how to love.  While I feel that Jack Twist's character is and was a homosexual man I feel that Ennis was more or less a man you found love in a place he least expected it.  He never sought after the attention of other men as Jack did.  In fact even after Alma leaves him he still seeks the affection of a woman, but Jack and Jack alone had stolen his heart.  That's what's so moving and inspiring about this film is that it parades the truth that love is love and one must embrace that love of lose all happiness they could ever know.What helps elevate this film so far above the competition is the brilliant acting on the entire cast, a cast of young talented stars who blew up in such a big way by taking on such a mature film.  Looking at the roster one may not believe they could handle the material but everyone involved is stellar.  Ledger plays Ennis with such restraint and precise confusion that one is brought to tears almost as much for Ledgers star turn as he is for the tragedy wrapped within his character.  Ledger creates a performance that stays with you.  Gyllenhaal also manages to brilliantly create a character we can relate to.  Jack Twist is someone we know and maybe even a little bit of each of us, a man who just wants to live his life and doesn't care what the consequences.  Death to him is a fair enough price to pay for freedom.  Michelle Williams is a revelation as Alma, her pain, her subtle emotion, her breakdown and her silently unraveling sanity is as moving as it is astonishing to watch.  Anne Hathaway, while not receiving the critical attention of her co-stars delivers a brilliant performance and deserves to be recognized.  Her performance as Lureen may not have been as baity as the character given to Williams, but she maneuvers her character through her scenes with a maturity that she is recently blossoming into.Visually stunning and emotionally captivating `Brokeback Mountain' is a movie that demands to be seen and taken seriously and is one that will stay with the viewer for years even decades to come.  We feel the pain in Ennis' gut as he falls to his knees in despair over leaving Jack.  We feel the torment in Alma's eyes as she watches the man she loves embrace another man.  We feel the frustration in Jack's demeanor as he pleads for Ennis to stay with him, give him anything more than an annual escapade.  But most of all we feel our own heart breaking and setting as we realize how this film and it's very essence effect us in ways we'd never imagine.  Gay, straight, male or female we have all met our Ennis or Jack and maybe even let him or her go because of outside influence or confusion of heart.  May this tragic tale of love denied and love lost move us to never let that happen to us again.	5.0	Deeply moving if not unsettling masterpiece of modern cinema...	2007-06-25	31	29	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A29X0YEL6O4KZI	"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer"""	"Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is a drifter, Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is looking for work. The opening sequence of the film signifies a beginning of these mens fate. Ennis and Jack are both at a trailer office of a herder, looking for work for a few months, just enough money to get by, but what unfolds from this fateful meeting is a relationship that effects these two men's lives until the day they die.When it comes down to it, Brokeback Mountain is a love story, yet what sets is apart from any other romance is the fact that these two cowboys happen to both be men. While on a job watching a sheep herd, Ennis and Jack become more then just coworkers. On their first encounter, the sexual experience seems completely lustful and animalistic. There are no words, just pure unadulterated lust. By the second encounter with these two men, you can see a change. These men are no longer just trying to get through the boredom of a lonely night, these men are in love. The contact is more emotional and sensual. Under normal circumstances, contact such as this between two men would make me queasy. But the way that director Ang Lee goes about it, leads to not nausea, but a genuine care for the characters. While watching, you don't look at these two men as homosexuals. You look at them as two men in love. Just two souls on the same line of fate that matched each other perfect. The end of the movie comes in a rush and moves along to quickly to hold any real emotion, which is my only qualm with the film as a whole.Heath Ledger as Ennis is amazingly well-cast. He is living the character rather then playing the character. His emotions are genuine and his gestures are natural. Jake Gyllenhaal also does a decent job of holding up his role as Jack Twist, but there are moments during his performance where it seems that he has not matured enough as an actor to hold such a role.His character seems annoyingly static, while it should be dynamic. Anne Hathaway as Laureen Newsome, Jack's wife, is ravishing as usual. Her beauty is persevered even as the years pass in the story and the times change.The script adaptation of the novel is transcribed very well from the pages to the big screen. Director Ang Lee does a consistently good job through out the film. The element that captures the touches of Ang Lee are the little things. Such as Ennis' daughter becoming a lot like her father, described as ""not saying much but getting her point across"". Ang Lee also does a stellar job of showing both mens point of views throughout the movie.So when all has been said and done, this was not a story about a homosexual relationship, but a tale of true love. Two souls bound for each other that seems not as much taboo as it does unfair. These men are stuck in their love, and are stuck in their on lives. But it just goes to show, love never dies. It only gets put on hold for a while.4/5"	4.0	A Tale Of Two Souls	2006-03-25	46	31	15
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A5FIIEYG9Z4LD	"andrew john raiskums ""musician"""	Brokeback Mountain is surely Ang Lee's finest film to date. It is a profound and deeply moving meditation on the nature of love; masterfully directed and adapted for the screen and featuring two incredible, couragious performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.Having read Annie Proulx's novella I found it remarkable how the details of her story and the flavour of her writing- those spare and startlingly matter-of-fact sentences- have been faithfully rendered in the film. Despite the length of the film, I don't feel there is an ounce of fat on it- the very deliberate pace, the long, lingering shots of the Wyoming highlands, the silences- all work to build the movie slowly but surely to its heart-rending final scenes. One review I read criticised the aforementioned nature shots but they are anything but gratuitous- throughout the course of the film the landscape comes to symbolise Ennis and Jack's intimacy- their freedom to express their love for each other- and all these shots are full of that tension.Heath Ledger is extraordinary in this film. His Ennis is a strong physical and sexual presence, but the way Ledger essays Ennis' inner torment is quite unforgettable. The mumbling, barely opening his mouth to speak, the constantly averted glances, the eyes, the smallest changes of facial expression. His emotions are always there, simmering away, never far from the surface. Some of his scenes are almost unbearable to watch- and these are usually the scenes where the depth and intensity of his love for Jack are revealed. I'll single out four such scenes.Firstly, the scene after they first leave Brokeback, where the two men have a terrible, awkward goodbye- Jack's longing for them to remain in touch is thwarted by Ennis' inability to resolve his feelings and Jack eventually drives off, leaving Ennis walking down the road. When Jack is out of sight Ennis moves to the roadside and sobs uncontrollably, overwhelmed by his emotions, shielding his face with his hat. Then the scene in which the men are reunited after four years of living apart, in which Ennis is totally unable to suppress his emotions and his desire for Jack- this is the  scene that is witnessed by Ennis' shocked wife. Then two scenes from the last part of the film. Firstly, when Jack desperately reveals that he can't bear to be apart from Ennis, which is followed by a flashback of the two men standing in front of a camp fire, all those years ago when they first worked together, Jack looking love-lost in front of the fire, Ennis softly singing to him. The potency of this scene is how quickly and efficiently it draws high contrast between the young, high-spirited men and the men who, 20 years later are leading completely different lives. The scene in which Ennis discovers Jack's blue parker in Jack's parents house after Jack's death is played to perfection- we register Ennis' profound sense of loss but he does not break down- as Jack's parents are downstairs and his fear, even then, keeps him from allowing his emotions to flow.Ang Lee has taken themes in the novella to a whole new level. With his restrained and almost at times austere direction I found that the homosexuality drifted to the back of my mind- that I was not seeing two men but two individuals fighting to realise their love for each other in the outside world. Indeed I feel that the films great message is that if you are unable to live the relationships you are supposed to live- then this can and does serve to damage and even destroy other relationships.Jake Gyllenhaal is also superb in this film. He creates a character that lights up the screen in every frame he is in. Of course Jack is a foil for Ennis- being lighter and more idealistic than the laconic, tormented Ennis- but time and again I was so moved by the way Jack articulates his love for Ennis- the cajoling, the horsing about, the harmonica playing, the humour- especially in the scene where he demonstrates his rodeo riding to Ennis. Jack's death is so terrible, especially as it comes true almost as a prophecy to Ennis, bringing full-circle the shocking vision he was shown as a child.I really enjoyed the way Ennis' eldest daughter was drawn in the film. Revealing to the bar chick that Ennis 'probably wasn't the marrying kind' was a beautiful, prescient observation of her father's nature. We feel her want to be closer to her father, nowhere more so than at the end of the film where she asks her father to come to her wedding, and Ennis- so lost, disoriented, alone and bereft manages to turn his thoughts towards her, to be there for her. But only after asking her if 'she really loves Curt'.The film is a draining but totally rewarding experience and it will stay with you long after you've left the cinema.It's a classic.See it.	5.0	a beautiful but infintely sad film	2006-01-28	34	30	4

It sounded ""western.""We have here two cowardly homosexuals who, instead of coming out of the closet, remain closeted snd severely adversely affect the lives of almost everyone they touch, most especially the females they marry and the children they father.To see them frolic together joyously in their birthday suits on one of their trists in the woods around Brokeback Mountain, after lying to their spouses about their whereabouts, activities and true feelings sexually, arouses no pity from me.These are two disgusting cowards, who reap poor rewards.This movie immediately made me want to see another GOOD movie...and wash my mouth, eyes and mind out with soap.Utter Rubbish."	1.0	"Same Time Next Year  ...with a GAY ""Twist"""	2008-02-25	48	12	36

Well he needs to see instead Sesame Street - That should please him!But MORE THAN THAT, both Brokeback mountain, the clouds, and the sheep aren't only ""landscape"", but also reflects the moods of characters - the feelings, described through those natural elements.

Poor reviewer that coudn't understand an easy message from the director/writers/producers/cinematographers...Brokeback Mountain is the Art of filmmaking, the movie breeds the language of the true American rural people.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1FE06N5A77K8W	Annie Feng	"I have to admit that the first half of the movie didn't capture me, I thought it dragged a little bit too long, and the mumbling texas accent made me hard to understand what they are saying. Also about the whole Gay part I just have to say that I really have NO particular feelings on the subject. Which means that I don't think being Gay is wrong, bad or even unnature, nor do I think that Gay people shouldn't belong together. But when I say I have no particular feelings I meant not one way or the other, the other in this case I meant I don't feel Jack and Ennis' romance, there is no sweet twinking love feeling for me. This is also a large part of the reason why I found it boring at first.But half way through I felt something, and it wasn't the Gay part but the honest feeling of loneliness. The misunderstanding recieved by people- the worst kind of loneliness, and also the feeling of wanting some thing so bad but cannot have it. This is portrayed very well and very deeply that it carves into your flesh and bone. It is very honest, and I think this movie is something everyone, whether you are straight or gay, can relate to.Also I disagree with some people saying that it portrayed gay people badly- that they only decieve. I didn't feel that at all, both men are, in a way, faithful to their wives and tried their best to be a good husband and father. But because of this unthinkable thing (during that time) that they want, they suffer for it, and torned between the voices in their hearts and the societal ""morals"".Also I like to say kudos to both actors, they truly shone out the characters, especially kudos to Heath Ledger, I think he will do great things in the future.I need to watch the DVD with subtitles before deciding whether to change my grading to five stars, hope it comes out soon!!!"	4.0	very honest story, true to the end	2006-02-04	16	10	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AJFHD901JO0TG	Anonymous	after finishing my 10th BBT view, I was so outrageous that I couldn't do anything else except to write down my anger so I can get over it. At the end of the movie, I cried out loud as hard as ever before. I just cannot stand the loss of such a beautiful love, the death of a human being for his strong love toward another being, and the mere existence of another being with the stark realization of what could have been. My tear poured out when I imagined the last day of any real Ennis who has experienced such a life. He probably closed his eyes with smile on the his face and woke up again as a 19 years old , young and without fear, on the moutain, among the meadow, Jack was laying beside him and bitching loudly what took you so long? Jack as he had always been: doey eyes and boyish smile, smoke on one hand and whiskey on the other .....As a straight woman, my heart goes out to any real Ennis. What makes this society a hell to live that love like this can ony exist in the aftelive? Why somebody has the privilege to judge the right and wrong and threaten other people lives for again these made-up rules? Why? Everyone can only live their life once, aren't they entitled to choose the love of their life as?Whever I work up at night in the past one month after my 1st reviewing, the blood-stained shirts popped up in my head,  and I cried for my old me, a biggot holding strong to the social rules. Thank you, heath, jack, ang, I have changed to be a better person.I do see splint of light at the end of the movie though. Fully aware of the presence of Alma, who knew the secret of Ennis and Jack, Ennis would attend his daughter's wedding. Finally, he was proud of the love Jack gave him. Jack's soul would have found peace from that moment.	5.0	It stays with you forever.	2006-04-17	46	38	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2UKC6QFG9L5GV	Anton Ilinski	"""Brokeback Mountain"" reminded me of Clint Eastwood's ""The Bridges of Madison County"" by its mood and pacing. It's one of those love stories that really touch your heart. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is not a simple story, it's about two persons' relationship and this relationship is complex like life itself. Jack and Ennis love each other although none of them are gay as they put it. But Ennis has a wife and two daughters, Jack also has a wife and kid. Besides where they both come from the bonds between two men that are too tight are not appreciated. There's more - they both work as cowboys, usually very manly occupation. But they attracted to each other and they can't do anything about it.This film is about happiness, about how difficult is sometimes to reach it yet it seems to be very close. It's difficult and easy at the same time, you just need to desire it very much. Therefore it's about decisions we make - sometimes wrong, sometimes right, but in the end no one can tell wrong from right. Jack and Ennis could be happy but the price could be the unhappiness of two broken families. Apart from being afraid of publicity they decided not to be happy themselves but also not to ruin the lives of their wives and children. So ""Brokeback Mountain"" is about moral obligations too.Maybe in other circumstances, in another time Jack and Ennis could live happily somewhere. But the story is set exactly where and when it's set so they had no choice.I guess Brokeback Mountain itself symbolizes every person's dream. It's the place people crave, where they are totally happy. Jack and Ennis were happy there sleeping on the ground, eating beans every day and being cut from the rest of the world. It was their personal paradise. I think if they could they'd live on the mountain, but they couldn't (the reasons don't matter), they've chosen to be happy for a couple of times a year, driving away from everyone else, having just each other, in the place they felt alive. It doesn't matter where they went - even some tatty motel would be their Brokeback Mountain from then on.I think everyone has his own Brokeback Mountain, his paradise, a place where you can be yourself. And it's not always a ""place"" literally. Some people finally get there and some not. Jack and Ennis couldn't.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautiful and sad story definately made by a sensitive person. And I'd say it's made for the sensitive. Ang Lee deserved his Oscar for sure. If you liked his ""The Ice Storm"" and you are not homophobic, you'll apprehend this film."	4.0	ANG LEE REALLY DESERVED HIS OSCAR	2006-04-16	30	17	13
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3KI9ZHXNGCKHH	Antonio Cunha Silva	HOW? I still don't know yet. THIS is a masterpiece!The music is astounding. I bought the soundtrack first because I love Gustavo Santaolalla music - incredibly poetic guitar chords that enhances the movie for a higher ground.The story of Ennis and Jack does not leave my head. I was touched in so many ways by this movie that I could not believe myself. Just can't stop thinking about those guys (and girls). I was a long time Ang Lee's movies lover - just remember how good is 'The Ice Storm' - but I never thought that a movie - this movie - could be so deep. It's Like a wound. It really hurts my heart. I will not forget this story as long as I live!From the start - the truck on the highway - to the unforgettable final scene, this movie delivers art in every image, in every scene, in every sequence. Wether in the mountain, in a bar or in the character's houses, everything is perfect.Heath Ledger, Jake Gylenhall and Michelle Williams (and also Linda Cardellini and Anne Hathaway) are truly amazing! Heath's performance is absolutely mesmerising, memorable and magnificent.I have never seen before a love story so beautifully told, filmed and played. This is Cinema.Please meet Ennis & Jack.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2EL3990HXOMZB	Antonio Robert	"""Brokeback Mountain"" will long be remembered as the first hugely acclaimed mainstream movie dealing with a same-sex love story. It is not surprising, it's rather logical and natural, that the original short story was written by a woman, Annie Proulx. Her female viewpoint on the world shows very clearly in both main male characters. Therefore, while the plot line may be implausible and far-fetched for a lot of viewers personally, the film is made with excellent craft and deeply human overtones, which make it more believable and psychologically real. Ang Lee's directing of big emotions (Sense and Sensibility; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and his work with actors is just peerless (Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of amazing). Not to mention the beautiful Wyoming scenery. The film drags a little bit in the second half, but overall is one of the most original movies to emerge in a rather poor crop of the industry post the year 2000."	4.0	Men's Love Story Penned By a Woman	2007-11-21	7	4	3

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ARA48345JZPZR	Archmaker	The various reactions I've heard and read about Brokeback Mountain seem to say more about the reactor than it does the film.  A very simple film about two very specific characters in a very specific time and place has been exaggerated into all sorts of politicized nonsense for and against.  So many agendas, so little time.I found this a beautifully written, acted, directed and photographed film filled with subtlety and understanding.  A compassionate study of an illicit love in a time and place of great repression, the movie walked a knife-edge and would have been even greater fodder for the late-night comedians had it not been in the hands of superb film-makers. Their skill has allowed a general audience to appreciate a film containing, for many, uncomfortable subject matter.I applaud the great courage of the two young leads who have been justly praised for their performances.  It looks good now, but it had a tremendous possibility for not only failure but also humiliation, and I recognize their risk-taking.But there was the writing of McMurtry and Osana, and the direction of Ang Lee and they made it work. And the specificity of the time and place is everything.This is a story of these two men, and the ruin they bring to themselves and others trying to live their lives as a lie, which was about their only option there and then.  I don't believe these guys lives bear any relation to the lives of gays in the great urban settings of New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles etc.  Jack might have fit in there, Ennis...never.I enjoyed the film as a specific story, like any other story.  The great craft involved allowed me to accept these characters and to eventually care about them, but I found no need to extrapolate beyond that to any great generalities.  If there was a message to this film, to me it was simply: live and let live.  And my God, wouldn't that be something.	5.0	A Simple Story told Exceptionally Well.	2006-03-09	38	33	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AIJN7CVPQ2CS5	arial	I've read the book and watched the film and I must say that Brokeback Mountain is an excellent film, well-made, beautifully directed with a haunting soundtrack and the perfect cast! Both Heath and Jake have an amazing chemistry on screen!In a nutshell, Brokeback Mountain is a bittersweet love story between two individuals, their love story is both tragic and beautiful at the same time. It is about a love that is altogether sweet, complicated, delicate, haunting, unfulfilled, frustrating and devastating. The moral of the story... if you are unable to be true to yourself and be with the one you truly love and desire, you may well end up destroying not only your own life but the lives of others around you... love is that strange and selfish.Highly recommended, however, having an open mind is a must.

That's the hype, right, two gay cowboys in love.So why did I see my friends and I in this story? Adolescent girls who couldn't imagine escaping the narrow confines of our strict upbringing. Young women struggling to find our way in a society which promised to prize independence but, too often, rewarded conformity.When you're stuck inside the status quo, when it's all you know, you've played a part in this film. And I, for one, have acted, at some point, for some person, rather than risk exposing myself to condemnation and punishment.Brokeback Mountain, with its vulnerable performances and clear-sighted direction, is about our natural human struggle. Our longing to belong pressed up against our longing to be ourselves. Our desire to live peacefully (and safely) pressed up against our need to live truthfully.This film reminded me that liberty can be a shared delusion. We enjoy certain freedoms, yes, yes, but that doesn't necessarily make us free.	5.0	Brokeback: No One Told Me	2007-07-07	45	42	3

I got the Broke Back Mountain C. D. after checking to see if Amazon was selling it, like the 1960's, this movie has not even hit my semi large town in the midwest BiBle Belt,and I had to drive 55 miles to see it.  This Midwest town , Basically has the same rules and attitudes aBout a Gay theme movie and gays, like  Ennis and Jake , I am gay, I know. But in this town, gays won't even hang out with other gay men ,out of fear of Being Beaten.  I hate that and it made the film so real to me.  Heck, I'm lying awake in Bed, Because I am thinking Ennis is a real person and I want to take him in my arms, and let him know it is okay to have a same sex partner.  As far as I can see, I have not seen a performance of that magnitude, since Charese  Theron  in""Monster""  Keith Legder made Ennis real, so real,it seems like I could reach out and  touch him.  I listened to the Soundtrack, which I hope gets the Oscar.  But what amazes me,is the fact that we have had gay love stories already like "" Torch Song Trilogy"" and ""Angel's in America"" and even ""Making Love"" with Harry Hamlin in the 80's.  What I think the society has done over just the last few years,  has pushed Back years of Being accepting and comfortaBle with gay individuals.... and that Breaks my heart.  And now all over again, it is time to come out....Be  re-examined.  I hope the Movie wins all 8, I keep hearing the part with the soft guitars in my head, each and every time the movie wins an Oscar. Copote..too easy for that guy.  I felt every tightness that Ennis had in his lungs, in his heart, and in punishing himself for expressing his feelings.  I don't like the ending.  I do Believe if Jake( Jack) could have waited a few more months, Ennis would have made the move.  I cried three times.  My favorite part is where they see each other after 4 years and they are so happy to Be with each other,they kiss unashamed and it's muskrat love!!MAGIC... on the steps to the house, where Ennis' wife could see. It made me cry.  That is love, gay or straight. I know those feelings of a long awaited distance romance and they did that so well.  They worked so hard.  I am haunted and forever will haunted(in a place in my heart) until I find that sparkplug romance.I am alone at 47, like Ennis Delmar  KEITH LEDGER .....geez... when he opened the closet with the Blood stained shirt and the Blood that ran through the shirt of Jack's...almost too hard to take ,it was his little shrine,they were Blood Brothers... his "" Love that will never grow old"" even now as tears well in my eyes.  Keith Ledger deserves the Oscar, he really worked that character.  And Besides all that , the panoramic mountain ranges gave it the air.... that Being gay needs to Breath .  It will win Best Movie, director, song, and Keith, you worked so hard. I used to act , do commercials and take long hours of acting classes, so I know how hard it is to create conflict within a character""...so to Ennis...I am..king of means By no means, king of the road.""

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2QQ6OWOUPV2YI	Ashley Wilson	"To say that I was delighted with this movie would be the understatement of this decade. There are 3 scenes that are totally captivating, the rest of this movie leaves you yearning  for more.After an evening of whisky Jack is feeling frisky and makes the first move on an unsuspecting Ennis. What ensues can only be described as an emotional rollercoaster for Ennis. Jumping up quickly, a brief scuffle, and angry almost violent sex (don't worry nothing is showing) He gives in to an obvious temptation. The next day he blows Jack off who is hurting big time. The scene that night in the tent when Ennis goes to Jack is mesmerizing! Apologizing between tender kisses Jack accepts his apology and a romantic interlude ensues. The 3rd of course Is the reunion kiss. Embracing after 4 long years out in the open you could see that they were dangerously near a kiss and both had to slow down, that is until Ennis backs up Jack pushes him against the bulding (strike the music) and bam more pure magic. I would recommend that the first time you see this movie, watch it all the way through. The second and third etc times you see it (once is not enough) leave the theatre happy right after that reunion kiss and imagine the way you may or may not have ended this movie yourself.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AG97Y9T29W2VD	"aspiring mathematician ""logician"""	"PURPOSE: Validate the conjecture that a happy movie would be sad.GOAL: Show that a happy movie would be sad, using ""Brokeback Mountain"" as an example.DEFINITION: happy movie - one that invokes happiness or satisfaction within the viewer so as to cause him/her to reward it with no less than 5 stars.THEOREM: ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a happy movie.PROOF: Let us assume that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a happy movie, then from our definition of happy movie, it follows that the viewer must reward it with no less than 5 stars. This implies that the movie has invoked happiness or satisfaction within the viewer. The viewer has awarded ""Brokeback Mountain"" with no less than five stars. This shows that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a happy movie and our proof is complete.REMARK: The proof of our theorem that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a happy movie only refers to a single viewer. However, this result of this proof is also applicable to multiple viewers. Furthermore, we can strengthen its validity if we use the fact that ""Brokeback Mountain"" has currently garnered over 900 customer reviews, a significant majority of which are no less than five stars. This implies that the movie has invoked happiness in not a single viewer, but multiple viewers.LEMMA: ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a sad movie.PROOF: Suppose that a sad movie is defined as one containing sad events or a sad ending. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a movie containing a sad ending. From our definition of sad movie, it follows that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a sad movie. This completes our proof.To show that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a happy movie that would be sad, we can use the results of our proofs of the theorem asserting that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a happy movie and the lemma asserting that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a sad movie and combine their resolutions. For instance, we can use the fact that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a sad movie containing a sad ending. which has garnered over 900 reviews from customers, the majority of which have five-star ratings. In spite of this, it contains a sad ending. The fact that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a sad movie containing a sad ending further implies that such a movie is what is necessary for a movie to invoke happiness or satisfaction within the viewer(s), as demonstrated by the hundreds of five-star reviews that it has received from customers. This validates our conjecture that a happy movie would be sad, using ""Brokeback Mountain"" as an example.REMARK: Although we have shown that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a happy movie which would be sad, we need to clarify any significant ambiguity concerning the nature of a sad movie.

Examples of sad events or a sad endings can are inclusive of, but not limited to, the following: the death of a main character, a terrible epidemic that wipes out a majority of the characters featured in the story, instances of unsolved poverty, inevitable warfare, natural disasters capable of invoking widespread famine, etc. We leave it to the potential viewer of the film to investigate further examples of sad events or sad endings found in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" lest we spoil crucial plot details."	5.0	"I agree with Cheerupper ""Andy""....."	2006-06-07	58	44	14

I won't go into a plot synopsis since that has been covered so many times on this site. I would like discuss the performances. Everyone involved in the film is excellent, in fact, flawless. I think Jake Gyllenhaal has been unjustly overlooked with all the praise over Heath Ledger's performance. Jake's performance is as good as Heath's--just in a understated sort of way. Also Ann Hathaway has an astonishing scene at the end on the phone with Heath's Ennis. My only complaint is that the film is a little slow, but this is a very tiny quibble. The screenplay is amazing and will definetly win the Oscar. I hope Jake is nominated for a supporting Oscar(he was strangely omitted at the Golden Globes???) Also check out the poignant soundtrack on CD. All in all, the best picture of the year--one you will not easily forget in your mind or heart."	5.0	Heart crushing tale of longing and loss	2006-01-17	21	17	4
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2FL0EKQ2EQ9E6	"a viewer ""a viewer"""	"Bar none this is the best film of 2005.  Epic and majestic in grandeur in performances and production values, this is a film which will remain with you long after the credits are done rolling.  Anyone who is dealing with unrequited love or a love that they can't have for whatever reason will gain a new perspective of the emotion after watching this film.  Its not a simple matter of lust, co-dependency, infatuation or all the cliche ridden adjectives that describe love.  Love is an emotional bonding and connection between two people ...it is unconditional....looking beyond the faults and seeing only the good.  This film establishes that fact and what is heartbreaking is that many people will see this and condemn it for being a love story between two men.  This film should have won the Oscar....it is so meaningful in so many ways.  Yet, I knew that homophobic hollywood would never bestow its highest honor on this film because of the ""gay theme"".  Instead, they bestowed it on a worthless picture ""Crash"" which in no way can ever compare to the beauty in ""Brokeback Mountain"".  The performances are unforgettable...although you may want to put the subtitles on because Heath Ledger's dialogue is hard to understand....he mumbles so much.  Much better is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack Twist who is magnificent.  He tears the heart right out of you....especially during the last confrontation scene with Ledger.  One feels his pain.  This is not to say that Ledger isn't good, he certainly is...he is excellent.  They both play off each other beautifully.  No less magnificent is Michelle Williams as Alma, Ledger's wife.  A sad pathos is manifested in her performance and she should have received an Oscar for her performance.  Everything about this film is top notch and if you are a romantic, then it will leave you breathless at the end."	5.0	ROBBED OF THE OSCAR IT DESERVED!!	2006-04-09	19	12	7

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"This is a movie that needed to be made. It was just the right vehicle with which to go mainstream with a gay love story.It starts in 1963, when Ennis and Jack spend the summer as sheepherders (not cowboys, although Jack also does rodeos) on Brokeback Mountain. In a scene that seemed completely authentic to someone with no personal experience of homosexuality but plenty experience in sexuality, they end up making love one night in their tent. And we have to say making love, not having sex. There is real feeling here along with the masculine horseplay. Thus begins a loving friendship that lasts over 20 years, mostly on ""fishing trips"" and other camping adventures away from wives and prying eyes.Remember this starts in 1963, long before the word ""gay"" had been developed as a healthy way to describe male homosexuality. They had a lot nastier terms in those days. And Ennis remembers when he was a child, his Daddy took him and his brother to view the remains of a man who had been mutilated and killed for being one of a couple of men who lived together. Understand this: he did NOT happen upon the corpse accidentally; his daddy took him to see it. As Ennis said, he probably was one of the people that did it.So naturally they want no one to know about their relationship. Thus the movie explores some of the hazards of closets.OK, no spoilers here. But you definitely do not have to be gay, or even bi, to appreciate this movie. That is exactly what's so valuable about it. Even straights can have real sympathy for the two close friends, likable guys, who look the part, but just don't quite fit the stereotype of the he-man of the western mountains, the rodeo and the ranch."	5.0	Movie-Making Breakthrough, and a Great Story as Well	2012-05-19	5	4	1

He hasn't, So Jack Twist goes on reluctantly with his life, and he also gets married (More for financial reasons than love)  4 years pass.Jack writes a letter to Enis saying he will be there for a visit. When he shows, all those old feelings resurface, and they head back to Brokeback, and it continues that way throughout the years, and through the years Enis rejects the idea of settling down together as a couple because of a gay-hate killing he saw as a child.The movie moves along nicely, to show the ups and downs of not only thier relationship, but thier relationships to others, thier friends and families throughout the years.There is a very heartfelt ending to this movie that I won't give away, but it will leave you thinking about ""Brokeback Mountain"" long after it is over.The acting is phenominal, the setting is beautiful, and the directing is flawless.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3EUSH8DPW75LR	barry	Some of the reviews here are so sad.  We live in such a troubled time where the most important thing should be for all people to be accepted totally - whatever their sex, race, age, color or sexual identity.  The hate reviews here really do trouble me for the hate really isn't for the people they are attacking but comes from within the people themselves.  The only people capable of such hate are those who have it within themselves and must look at themselves first.That aside, let me review the brilliant masterpiece that is BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  The film is beautiful in every way.  Spellbinding cinematography, amazing script and actors giving some of the best performances of their career.  This film for all its grandeur is a simplistic, realistic love story for the ages.  Some have called it the gay GONE WITH THE WIND.  The most important thing here is that none of the characters are stereotypes.  Yes, the relationship is between two men but that is not the purpose of the film.  It is not a gay message film.  It is a love message film.  When two people connect in that special way that enables them to share their hearts, souls and celebrate it through the beauty of sexual expression it is a gift for any two people be they man/woman, woman/woman or man/man.  When this unique transcending true love is actualized it can happen between any two people.  A man who lives his life straight may find it with one other special man.  He may not be what we define as gay.  His love is for this man.  With this man gone he may desire no other man.  True love is such a gift and should never be denied.  And shame on anyone who tries to deny others from having it.Here we see that kind of love happen for Ennis and Jack.  The intimacy they feel takes the two of them by surprise and they develop a bond that only comes with true love.  The film shows us how they both deal with this love and how it affects their lives and other interpersonal relationships.  Heath Ledger and Jeke Gyllenhaal are spellbinding here and attack their characterizations with true honesty no holds barred.  The other stand out is Michelle Williams in a ground breaking, career making performance as Ennis's wife.  Her journey could have been so stereotypical but in her hands it is a splendind self realized exploration a woman must endure.The story here is romantic, tragic, happy sad and a timeless tale.  The blu ray version is astounding.  This film was made for it and it will seem like viewing the picture for the first time.  The 1080p high def picture is astounding.  The scenery pops with immense clarity, colors are crisp and close ups have perfect flesh tones.  The dialogue comes out strong and the beautiful music soars through the speakers as this beautiful tale is told.This film should definitely have won best picture but the fact that it got so many nominations is enough I guess.  I pray for the day when we as a society celebrate love pure and simple with no other issues mattering.  Highly recommend this amazing film.	5.0	Review of film and blu ray version	2009-03-15	20	17	3

It can exsist in any time or place. And it is the onetrue force that all living things respond to.So it doesn't matter that Jack and Ennis are men.What only matters is that they are in love.And this is the joyous, yet sad thing about this movie. That love is never a smooth primrose path. But more like a rocky back road, that we more often just stumble across.It's a visually stunning movie.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2YM0JQI2IO0VS	"B. Berthold ""brad13"""	...than just a 'gay cowboy movie.'  But also just that.  Two rough and tumble, unschooled, primitive men of the American West come to learn painfully and ultimately, tragically, that  Marlboro men do indeed sometimes fall for each other...After some 756 reviews, one is hard pressed to say something refreshing about this film.  Yet, the sheer fact that discussion about BBM is so alive and thought-provoking attests to the greatness of this film as a piece of art.  Ang Lee has succeeded in creating something so visceral, so moving, so elusive and infinite in its meanings that twenty years from now, we'll still being try to decipher it.While some of the reviewers have referred to Jack and Ennis as 'unsympathetic' characters, I would rather use the word, 'human.' Yes, human.  A story about two deeply flawed and deeply scarred human beings who struggle to find a way to that which redeems us all: love.  Ennis and Jack's struggle is a universal one, that of loving somebody in the fullest and most elemental sense of the word.  That is why this film is for us all, regardless of sexual persuasion.  BBM is an epic tale about the costs of loving somebody whom your world, your family and even yourself deems to be unacceptable or just plain 'wrong.'From the minute we see them, Ennis and Jack are more than just gruff ranch hands thrown together by the whims of fate.  As he  gets out of his beat-up pick-up and very deliberately saunters(dare I say, sexily) towards an Ennis caught in the burn of his gaze, Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is out for something.  And that something just happens to be Ennis Del Mar.  As he spies Ennis through his side mirror whilst shaving, Jack is a man under a spell.  Unconciously or consciously, acting on his desire for Ennis is just a matter of time.  As both men move up the mountain, the ball between them starts to roll, picking up momentum with each gorgeous shot of the Canadian Rockies.  Ledger's Ennis wears the face of man fighting back every feeling he might have, and feelings for Jack especially.  But feelings and desire have 'no reins on them' as Ennis accurately points out.  Both characters slowly succomb to these feelings as their time on Brokeback passes.  Ang is the master of the tiny things that speak volumes. Whether its his intense concentration NOT to look at the naked Ennis or his child-like concern over Ennis' wounds, Jack indulges in his initial fascination and lets himself be ready for the moment.  And that moment soon comes with one of the most raw and REAL portrayals of homoerotic passion you'll see this side of pornography.  While born of the moment, Jack and Ennis' explosion is the culmination of their evolving and very unacknowledged desire for one another.  How this scene could have surprised and/or shocked anybody is beyond me.  All the signs were there, you just had to be looking.Like the black and white of a checkerboard, Ledger and Gyllenhaal complement each other like few other on-screen lovers have. Gyllenhaal's performance is nothing if not amazing.  How a straight actor could manage to capture Jack's open yearning for another man so perfectly, so precisely, is simply miraculous.  Jake's Twist is almost innocent in his near-joyful acceptance of the possibility that Brokeback offers.  He is the ennabler of the relationship, always looking for the road down the mountain where their fire can be continued. Yet, even Twist is confused by what this could all mean.  'Me neither,' he replies to Ennis' adamant declaration of not being 'queer.'  Part of the film's excruciating beauty is that both characters never really come to terms with who they are.  Men who love each other.No ride off here into the sunset. Ennis and Jack are the products of their time.  1963 America, where every man had to be JFK and every lady, Jackie.  And if you weren't, you'd best keep it to yourself, far in the closet, far from Mr. Kinsey.  More than that, BBM's world is rural, frontier, hardscrabble 1963 America where the mere idea of two men loving each other represents an assault on that most precious icon of Americana, the cowboy.  The laconic champion of simple goodness who stands for justice and defends the weak against the guys in black hats.  Falling in love with another cowboy ain't in the scipt and that's what makes Jack and Ennis' love so heroic, so fragile, so ultimately doomed.So you've had sex a couple of times with a buddy out in the boondocks and now it's time to come back into the rigid, heterosexual world of 1960's America. What's a queer cowhand to do?  Get married, sire a couple of kids and try to put it all behind you.  Jack and Ennis follow suit, but nature can't be held back.  Their first meeting after their marriages has to be one of the most passionate and tortured film 'kisses,' if that's the word one can use here, you'll ever see. Ledger and Gyllenhaal will leave you in a whirlwind.  As will Michelle William with her performance as Alma, Ennis' wife.  Alma's look of shock and disbelief as she stares through the glass window at her husband entwined in the arms and lips of another man is just one of the many grand cinematic moments in this film.  Alma's face is one of profound confusion. What just happened and what does it all mean?  Michelle Williams is indeed one of the highlights of BBM.  She doesn't need to say anything, her taut and pained expressions tell it all. A woman struggling to pick up the pieces of her shredded dream with dignity and self-respect.  Moreover, Ann Hathaway does a stellar job as Laureen Newsome, Jack's attractive Texas wife, a woman captivated by Twist's bull-riding prowess and boyish smile only to gradually learn what Alma knows early on.As the years drag by, both men settle for the costs and freedoms of the double life.  Fishing trips to Brokeback a couple times a year and then back to the lie with their women and families.  A lot has been mentionned already about the extreme damage both men cause their families.  And the claim is valid enough, if not too realistic.  Proulx and Lee wanted to show characters of THEIR time, crippled and blinded by THEIR circumstances, by THEIR environments and not least, by themselves.  After having witnessed the horrid aftermath of a hate crime as a young child, is it any wonder that Ennis has become a walking time bomb, striking out at anybody rather than admit he might not be all that different from the old rancher his father murdered.  Think about it people, most of us in Ennis' situation would have also strived for the so-called 'normal' life.Like Twain's Mississippi, Lee and Proulx's Brokeback is a mythical place.  Lee's masterful use of the West's untouched natural grandeur is without parallel.  Is not the mountain the third character in this relationship?  A place where the two lovers, like Adam and Eve, can act out their feelings in complete harmony with their surroundings.  A place unfettered by social constraint, tradition, expectation.  A place which allows Jack and Ennis to do that which should come most easily, to love.  Brokeback is a profoundly 'American' place, far from the maddening crowd, a place where self-limitation and painful compromise are unknown.  A place where it's all up to you to create your own heaven and/or hell.  Yet, such freedom comes at a heavy price. As Jack rightly says, 'Brokeback is all we got!'  What was once their playground of freedom, soon becomes their prison, their hideaway from the lies of their everyday lives.  Jack had the answer once.  He was willing to give this 'thing' a chance.  A ranch together, a life together...but Ennis's fear is just too much to overcome.  'Two men living together...if you can't fix it, you gotta stand it.'  And with such stoicism, Ennis nails the lid to both their coffins.  Denied the only one he ever really wanted, Jack looks elsewhere for his Ennis substitutes, which eventually lead to his ignominious murder.  Yet, could he have done otherwise?  Could he have been strong enough to forget Ennis Del Mar and cut off their relationship completely?  Are any of us strong enough to deny ourselves true love when it comes our way?  Is Ennis to blame for driving Jack to his death, for fostering his own emotional death due to his inability to conquer fear?  Who can judge? Certainly not us.  Such is the complexity of Ang Lee's art that it defies our natural desire to point the finger at the characters.Brokeback finishes on the same note it began, one of omnipresent sorrow and unbearable longing, longing destined to be unfulfilled. Shattered by Jack's murder and more importantly, by his own culpability in it, Ennis Del Mar has become a violent and empty shell of a man when his loving daughter, Alma Jr.(played brilliantly by newcomer Kate Mara), invites him to her wedding.  When asked whether her boyfriend truly loves her, she replies, 'Yes, Daddy, he does.' Ennis winces in pain, in regret at not having done like his daughter, at not having accepted love when it came his way.With Ennis's faintly voiced, 'I swear...,' a great American film closes.  And so much more than that.  A biting and gritty lesson on how lives should and should not be lived.  The reasons for watching BBM, repeatedly I might add, are many. More than anything, BBM should be seen and seen again as an example, par excellence, as to what a genius with a camera is capable of creating.  Ang Lee's visual poetry, similar to that of another maverick director, Terence Malick, is breathtaking.  Whether it be a single tear down a cheek, a look up at the camera in fear and confusion, icy red lips before the phone or the ultimate cowboy posing before the rocket's red glare, Lee manages to create scenes that will remain in you long after the lights are up.  Like a Hucklberry Finn of its day, Brokeback Mountain is more than just an indignant cry against injustices that remain with us still.  It's all that and so much more...	5.0	So much more...	2006-05-13	34	30	4

I sat in the theater with men, women, teenagers, families, and yes, of course, some same-sex couples.  But by the end, it was dead quiet - Schindler's List quiet.  It's the most gut-wrenching end to any movie in American cinema, and I challenge anyone, regardless of political or religious orientation not to feel the humanity of this film.  Agree or disagree with the relationship at the crux, but see it first.Everyone's talked about Ennis and Jack - but what about the sincere depiction of the difficult and lonely cowboy life and work ethic and stoicism of rural Americans that shaped the American West?  The contrast between socio-economic levels is as stark as the land...farms are in shambles, and money is scarce for Ennis and Alma, and Jack's parents.  The land is rugged and unforgiving, and there's no movie in modern times as honest about this when showing how cold, dirty, hard, and un-romantic life is for cowboys and farmers.  Their trucks and houses are run-down, and there's a sparseness to the landscape that echos - or perhaps inspires - the spareseness of dialog.  Jack lucks out when he marries into a wealthy family, but that drives the men further apart when Ennis must sacrifice time with Jack to earn a meager but steady income for his family.  Choosing duty and responsibililty over happiness and love - a universal, and timeless, conflict.  Putting your family before your personal happiness - gee, what a concept in today's society!If you weren't comfortable to see this movie in the theaters, I hope you'll rent or buy it and watch it at home, and make the decision for yourself - especially if you're a fan of the western genre.  It deserves more than a cliche and a snicker.Oh - and for all of you who wanted to see the wives more understanding, the families more accepting, or the men more communicative... THAT is Hollywood, and self-help books, and Oprah - but it's NOT real life, especially not in 1963 Wyoming.  And that is why this movie is so good - it's not pretty, it's not fun, and it doesn't have a happy ending.  But that is why it will stick with you for days and weeks after.See this on the biggest TV you can find, and watch it in widescreen.  And if you can see it in a theater, do it .  Seeing it in large-format reinfornces all the key aspects of the film, from the desolation of the land, to the distance between the characters, to the amazing vistas that are the backdrop for most scenes, including the pivitol opening one."	5.0	So much more than two men with feelings for each other	2006-04-30	52	45	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1FJ30YH7GQXLS	Beckela	"I admit I am obsessed with Brokeback Mountain -- AND Jake Gyllenhaal. Those eyes!!!! No, I'm not an old woman lusting after a gorgeous young movie star! It's a maternal thing, very strange, that I've never experienced before. I believe he is one of the best actors I've ever seen; his face is so expressive you know exactly what his character is thinking/feeling. Since seeing Brokeback, I have seen most of the movies he's done -- Brokeback is NOT a fluke. He is brilliant! I even bought Donnie Darko, a very weird, but interesting, film that provokes much discussion. I love it. It's been a cult favorite for years, especially in England. It was shot in 2000 so he's grown up a lot since then. He's now 25 and I'm convinced he is on track for an incredible career -- I hope he continues to make the right choices. Heath Ledger is wonderful, of course, but I am much more taken with Gyllenhaal -- don't know why, exactly. Maybe it's the eyes! Gyllenhaal is also a great interview (although he, too, rambles!); he's charming, funny and down to earth. After winning the BAFTA (British Oscar equivalent) for Brokeback, he told reporters, ""I think it's a bit premature, but I'll take it.""At a press conference in Toronto for Brokeback, Gyllenhaal described the script as being poetic and beautiful. Half of it is screen direction, with wonderful, detailed paragraphs delineating what the characters are feeling. He gave an example: Jack looks at Ennis and he feels a thousand rivers flowing through him. He didn't actually say which scene that is, but you'll know when you see the film. His face is an open book.I'm not only obsessed, but I feel compelled to talk about the film, obviously. This film has touched me in a very deep place, bringing to the surface overwhelming feelings I buried so deeply so long ago I'd forgotten about them. It has to do with my ""past life,"" my ex (who is gay), and more -- stuff I thought I had dealt with. It never ends, does it? Brokeback is a love story with insurmountable obstacles, but it's much more than that. It's a story of unrealized dreams and unfulfilled lives -- we can all identify with that.Another very important point: Jack and Ennis are not the only tragic figures here. The ramifications of their relationship are far reaching -- and I am so glad the screenwriters (Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana) were wise enough to expand the roles of the women. All the actresses are excellent. I haven't read the short story by Annie Proulx (don't want to obliterate the images I have from the film), but I understand the women are barely in it. Without them, the film wouldn't be nearly as profound. And, the scenery/setting is as important a character as the people.Thank you for ""listening."" I'll leave you with what a friend, a very smart director, wrote to me:""Oddly, I'm tempted to write an analysis of Brokeback Mountain because that film had SO much aesthetic and intellectual content--that's why it's so upsetting that the Academy gave the Oscar to Crash--so simplistic in construct and formulaic in its approach ..."""	5.0	Profoundly Affecting	2006-04-05	30	25	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AR37967IAR6ZT	Benjamin	"Yes, Ang Lee's love story is a great movie. It's a hearbreaking, visually stunning Western. It's really well acted, particularly by Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams, brilliantly written, original and incredibly moving. Most critics have acknowledged this. But what makes BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN such a revelation is because it's a gay movie. That's what makes the film important. That's where it breaks new ground. That's why it matters. A friend of mine says that the only reason the film is generating so much buzz is because it's gay, that if it were a straight Western romance it wouldn't garner attention. I told him he was right, but I told him it was because his ""straight Western romance"" had already been made. Many people have commented that the film's theme is universal, applicable to all audiences. Sheep herders Jack and Ennis find themselves in love in 1963 and don't have a context with which to deal with those feelings. Those who speak of a ""universal theme"" say that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is about a romance that its lovers cannot deny yet cannot make work. This is all true, but I think it's unfair to the movie to say that it's really about ""everyone."" I am a gay man, and I couldn't divorce myself from that while watching this movie. Part of the reason I liked it is because I felt, while it was happening, like it belonged to me and spoke for me as a homosexual. I felt its impact, its originality. I wanted to nurture it and tell other people about it. I wanted to learn from it, and I wanted others to see it and learn. It's a story that I've been waiting for, even though I didn't know it. The documentary THE CELLULOID CLOSET, released several years ago, showed us Hollywood's history of how it subtly hid yet depicted homosexuality. If gay people wanted to see gay stories, they had to go into straight movies and ""decode"" the hidden gay themes. With BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, gay people are, for once, not the ones who have to dig in order to relate to the film's ""universal"" message. This is our movie, and it's a great one, a cause for celebration."	5.0	The most important gay movie yet made.	2006-01-03	28	20	8

After the movie was out on DVD I bought a used copy at reduced price.  My husband and two sons (ages 13 and 21) were horrified that I had purchased the movie.  I made sure to watch it when they weren't home, so they couldn't ruin it for me.I'm not homophobic in the least.  I watched the movie completely with an open mind.The story was slow, the actors muffled their words, and the ending was extremely depressing.  Immediately after watching it, I rated it ""Good, but VERY sad.""  I even found it a little sexy in a strange sort of way.The next day, however, after giving it more thought... I was really grossed out!  The two cowboys were just too masculine for a romance to be taking place between them.  I realized what I found sexy was that I liked the men in the movie.I watched the movie on a Saturday night.  Come Sunday morning, while I was sitting in church, I started feeling a little guilty about having viewed some of the sexual scenes the night before.  GADS!!

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ADXY2YKIZSC1G	BHogg	Often times, good films will get hyped-up to the max due to word of mouth, and will ultimately dissapoint the audience, because while it may be a good film, it did not live up to their expectations.Even with all the hype, Brokeback Mountain aviods this, becoming not only the most heartbreaking and memorable film of the year, but also of this decade.  There really cannot be enough good things said about this film.It tells the story of Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, two simple cowboys who one summer go up to work at Brokeback Mounatin, and long story short, end up falling in love.  The rest of the movie follows their relationship and the few times they meet over the next 20 years.The direction is perfect, what else can be said?  Ang Lee deserves the Oscar, as he will likely get it.  The scenery alone is worth the price of admission, and I gasped several times just seeing it.The performances will break your heart as well.  Who thought Heath Ledger was capable of giving such a powerful performance after his recent movies, but he does.  Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams, and my personal crush Linda Cardellini also do magnificent jobs.Overall, Brokeback Mountain should be seen by everyone; not just for the political message, which is in itself important, but also to see the best movie of the year, and a landmark cinematic experience.  Anyone who sees it will never forget it, and it has earned all the hype.	5.0	Retrace the Steps, as if we forgot...	2006-02-14	19	13	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3VMFB5T15HAHD	B. H. Smith	In this film everyone involved suffers. Wives and husbands. I felt sorry for Alma especially. She held in her sadness for so long until she exploded on Enis during a holiday dinner. Ennis was afraid of what would happen to him and Jack because of the story his father told him. Their affair was forbidden by society and Ennis knew it. Jack suffered because he was always being shunned out by Ennis. That's why he went to Mexico. Laureen was blind throughout the entire film until Ennis talked to her after Jack's passing and she put one and one together. Ennis was the character that had the most troubling conflict. He had trouble coming to terms with his relationship with Jack.  He despised Jack's crusing trips to Mexico. Ennis was loyal to his family and Jack. As for Jack, he was shunned by his father, an emotionless marriage, and his father in law. Something had to snap inside of him and that's was why he went to Mexico. Like I said everyone suffered in this film. It's sad, but in the end minus Jack everyone moved on with their lives. The film was well written and well acted. It will stand the test of time.	5.0	Brokeback Moutain Review	2007-11-29	9	6	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A24JGB5GJEFRVF	"BigBadJon ""BigBadJon"""	"I had to see for myself what all the hoopla was about, when I viewed Brokeback Mountain, as it had been used as a topic of discussion and the brunt of many homophobic jokes on the ""Jay Leno Show"" as well as other daytime and late night talk shows when it was in the theatres. It was touted as a great ""chick flick,"" where guys can show their sensitive side afterwards and win points with their dates. It has been called a ""gay cowboy movie,"" which it isn't, because the two main characters are not cowboys, but are shepherds. [The western attire somehow translated into cowboy with many viewers, but it takes place in the years after 1963, not in the old West.]It's a heart-wrenching story about two young men who are forced into a situation of isolation as they shepherd a huge flock of sheep on Brokeback Mountain. Loneliness leads to playful interaction, which leads to sharing a tent, then to sharing body heat, and finally to sharing emotional and then sexual intimacy. At the end of the short-termed shepherding contract, the two men depart, both torn asunder by the loss they feel for each other. Years pass, marriages and babies become part of each man's life. Then they are reunited, and all the past intimacy returns to haunt them. ""I wish I knew how to quit you,"" is the cry of the one man as he recognizes and struggles with the depth of ongoing feelings he has for his now older lover.  His lover responds stoicly, ""Then why don't you?""In an era where a child is told about a homosexual couple being discovered and a homosexual man is dragged to his death by his genitals until they detach from his body, neither of the story's protagonists are able to deal with the social consequences of loving another man. Neither is able to tell anyone, including his wife. Both turn to alcohol. One turns to secretly meeting other men. Every emotion is strained as one watches the torment of both of these men, their wives, and even their children. Divorce partially delivers one, because ""you weren't fishing,"" when he met his lover, but he remains focussed on raising his two children, still being unable to develop his relationship with his lover. How the story ends left many a tearful eye by the time the credits rolled in the theatres. And many a married man will be secretly watching this movie on DVD to find out how NOT alone he is in the world of men secretly loving men."	5.0	Broke Heart Mountain	2006-02-23	34	26	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A16E2XTMT1SC46	BigD	While slow-paced and with little action, let alone dialogue, it's a very sad story of thwarted love, universal, and not just the &#34;gay cowboy&#34; story it was marketed as.  Unable to be together, but unable to be themselves apart, it can apply to any type of relationship.  Seeing the movie in the theater, I was left feeling somewhat disappointed, as if there should have been more.  Although I thought it was excellent and that Ang Lee had once again captured a place and time so well (and without the usual movie-cliche' touchstones) that despite how foreign it may be to me personally, it seemed very real.  However, as I left the theater I felt rather numb and by the time I got to the subway at the corner, I burst into tears.  Every time I thought about the movie over the next few days, which was frequently, I did again.  I could not say why at the time, but there was something very, very deep in this movie that went to my soul.  When I purchased the DVD, I did so partly as an experiment to see how I'd react seeing it again.  I was a puddle of tears almost immediately and was so for quite a few more viewings.	5.0	Magic	2012-12-20	6	5	1

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3J5ZKU6DRTUTC	"Billy Bob ""Bill"""	"The Wives! The Wives...... the poor wives...This seems to be the cry of many who wanted to dislike Brokeback Mountain. It's one thing to be gay, but it's another to cheat on your wives..... an assertion that entirely misses the point the movie is trying to make.I'm actually aware of a leader of some Catholic group stating on radio, that she would think respectable gay men wouldn't like this movie because of the infidelity these gay men engaged in.Most of these people don't believe the word homophobia describes a legitimate social force. Or one that they would care about. For if it is a legitimate social force, they see it as something that only affects gay men. A term created by political activists for the ""gay agenda.""And countering that idea is the message of the movie... Homophobia affects far more than gay men.If Ennis (and so many more) hadn't been raised in such a hostile environment, he could have accepted himself for who he was. He and Jack could have been honest about themselves, and lived safely together their entire lives.Because of homophobia, they couldn't. Many can't today. The familial and societal pressures for men to marry and have children are great. It is expected. So many gay men have been advised by their religious leaders to solve their homosexuality by marrying a woman. I myself was advised that by a Mormon church leader in the early 80s. He said to me, ""Sex with a woman is so wonderful, that once you've experienced it, you'll never think of another man again."" Fortunately, I knew deep down that would never be true. I asked him, ""But what woman would be willing to take a chance on me as some kind of experiment."" And I swear to God, he said, ""Why tell her? It's a sure thing sex with her will change you, so why jeopardize it by telling her?""Well I never did marry (thankfully). I did join the Air Force, and won nearly every award open to me. That didn't work either. I left the Air Force to go through the Mormon Church's program to change me. A total, laughing joke. The idea was that by learning to play masculine sports like basketball and baseball with carefully selected straight men, we would now capture the male bondings we lacked in adolescence and ""grow"" out of homosexuality. I knew right then it was a farce because I'd always played masculine sports - football (quarterback), baseball (shortstop), and track, etc. I bonded fine.Of course, not one person was changed... and after a few months, most quite attending these useless meetings, and silly sports events. As time passed, it wasn't uncommon to run into other `graduates' down at one of the gay bars.In that church group, there were numerous married gay men who were now in the stages of divorce, and who were losing contact with their children. Wives forbidding them to see their kids. Many of these men were suicidal. It was pitiful. And the entire legal system of the Mormon state of Utah was against them. They had absolutely no chance to have their rights recognized or considered.It turns out, at that time, there were two large support groups for Mormon women who found themselves married to gay men. Several chapters were written about it, or were authored by members of it, in the groundbreaking book, ""Peculiar People: Mormons and Same Sex Orientation."" These people described their experiences, and the education they received about putting your faith in the church leaders as opposed to facing reality.Before Peculiar People was published, a famous Mormon poet, Carol Lynn Pearson, wrote a book ""Goodbye, I Love You,"" about taking care of her gay husband as he died. Another woman whose life was changed because homophobia kept her husband from being able to be what he was. And so he tried to be what his church wanted, and married her..... but could not deny his nature.... and she so lovingly took him back when he was ill, and cared for him until his death.In the early 90's, before I left the `land of Zion,' a newspaper article appeared in the Salt Lake Tribune, about the alarming number of faithful Mormon women who were turning up HIV positive. Turns out their husbands were stopping off in public restrooms on their way home for a quickie with men, or steam rooms at gyms, or gay bars... or wherever. And then the virus was passed to them. But what if those men had never been pressured to marry women? What if they had the institution of marriage to anchor them into a monogamous union with one other man? It's a damn good chance neither these men or their wives would have been infected.Any of these people know that the culprit in all this isn't homosexuality - which is a part of nature and always has been. Nor is it the expression of homosexual sex, as sex is a gift from God to all of us. It wasn't the gay men who didn't know better, and so they put their faith in their ignorant religious leaders, believing that marriage would change them. It was simply that ignorance coupled with fear that was at fault. And ignorance coupled with fear is the very basis of homophobia.Homophobia made victims, not only of the men, but of their wives and children. Homophobia assured those homes would be broken before the marriage vows were ever taken.Alma and Lureen were as much the victims of homophobia as Jack and Ennis. Only Jack and Ennis had their personal safety to worry about, unlike the wives. And Ennis had such internalized homophobia he couldn't even face himself.In this day, when we have politicians from the president on down, going around crying out that they have to `save' marriage by denying homosexuals equal opportunity in marriage, they are using this same homophobia for political gain. Have you ever heard George Bush explain just how his and Laura's marriage would be affected if a Jack and Ennis were given the legal rights marriage offers? Of course you haven't. And you never will because there is no threat to the institution of marriage just by extending it's benefits to gay and lesbian citizens (who also pay taxes by the way, and who were also born under a constitution that guarantees them the right to the pursuit of happiness, which would include having a family).Imagine Jack and Ennis living in Canada today, instead of Wyoming during the 60s. They could get married. They would have legal protections. There would be no wives being cheated on. All of them could have a happy life. What is so wrong with that?That is the message of this movie. Homophobia destroys. Being allowed to be what you are, openly, and with same rights as others brings on a life of happiness.So for those of you who are so concerned about the wives, and feel to criticize the movie because these guys cheated on their wives because they couldn't deny their nature.... understand what is truly responsible. Then lend your support for the Jack's and Ennis' and Alma's of the world. Support gay marriage.... Let's create a reality where people can be what nature made them to be...And for the reviewer who wrote the last two negative reviews (obviously the same individual), there was no ""rape"" in the tent scene.  Do you know what rape is?  It is forcing someone to have sex against their will.  Jack initiated the encounter.  It was not against his will.And to reviewer J.E Barnes, thanks for all the insights about the symbolisms.  I caught some of them, but you pointed out others that really make the film even more interesting."	5.0	The Poor Wives!!!	2006-02-09	78	64	14

But continuity means nothing to movie makers who want the product placement payola more than they want to make a great movie.Brokeback is NOT a great movie by any stretch of the imagination.  It's widely overrated simply because it is about homosexuals.  The dialogue is often painfully simplistic relative to the dramatic impact the movie wants to make.  Heath Ledger's character is so wooden, it's hard to understand what the heck Jake sees in him.The portrayal of the characters in middle age is a joke.  They still look like they're in their 20s.  A fake mustache was a quick and easy but pathetic attempt at aging Jake.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E	B. Martin	"After viewing Brokeback Mountain, or as some like to peg it, ""the gay cowboy movie"", I found myself having to defend it's merits in a debate with my brother.  He made two key arguments:  first, that the love story involved two gay men was a mere ploy to make the movie seem more important than it really is and second, that Heath Ledger's character, Ennis, was let off the hook by the film's ending.  So I'm going to begin this review by responding to each of those criticisms.  There is no doubt that the fact that the two main characters in this movie are gay men is to push an agenda.  But it's not a gay rights agenda.  It's a human rights agenda.  Yes, the movie garnered attention because of its subject matter, but that's the point.  The film wants us to realize that love and desire do not discriminate.  It can find anyone, be it a heterosexual, interracial or gay couple.  By presenting us with two gay men as leads, the film challenges our ingrained predjudices right off the bat.  Surely this will be a movie that will make even the most open minded individual a bit uncomfortable, right?  Wrong.  The genius is that as soon as this beautiful film starts to unspool, we forget that we are watching two gay men.  Jack and Ennis could be any couple who are separated from one another by society's constraints (think interracial couples, rich kid/poor kid, etc.).  They become two human beings who find love with one another but never realize it due to their own fears and the expectations of others.  The movie's goal is to change hearts and minds and in order to do that, it has to prove to its viewers that we are all human and victims of our own emotions and desires, regardless of our sexual orienttion.  If the movie had spent the entire time preaching about the prejudices of society and hammering us over the head with a blatant gay rights agenda, I would have agreed with my brother's first point.His second point does have some merit.  In one reagard, the ending of the film lets Ennis off the hook in the sense that he never has to step forward and make a choice; to continue living a lie or to come to terms with his true nature and make a life with Jack.  In real life, most people faced with Ennis' choice would probably do nothing and simply watch as time passed them by.  So I agree that Ennis did get out of having to make a choice.  But here is what my brother's argument misses:  although Ennis has the choice taken away from him, he does not get to escape the guilt and loss that will live with him for the rest of his days.  He doesn't get to decide whether or not he is going to be haunted by his indecision and he will never get an opportunity to change what could have been.  But is it possible, that by having this choice taken away from him, he will grow and learn and in the future he will act on opportunities?  Sometimes the only way people learn is by their mistakes.Oh, and as for the movie, it's skillfully directed by Ang Lee and the performances are superb.  Jake Gylenhall is great as Jack, the man who is more in touch with his needs and desperrately wants a life with Ennis.  But it is Ledger, as Ennis, who gives this movie its heart.  In Ledger's performance Ennis is a man who doesn't understand his own emotions.  He reacts with anger and violence whenever his regular life bumps up against the urges that are rumbling beneath the surface.  He says more about his loneliness, yearning and anger with downward glances and barely intelligible mumbles than other actors could have with lenghty soliloquies.In essence, Brokeback Mountain is an old-fashioned, tragic love story that never resorts to cheap sentiment and keeps its emotions largely in check....much like its wounded, lost soul, Ennis."	4.0	A simple, devastating love story	2008-11-22	10	5	5

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2ZFRHGC9HKXBI	Bob Arr	"I went to see the movie in response to the reviews and accolades it was getting, but I had never read Annie Proulx's story. Consequently, I didn't know many of the details before I went.As the movie began, it seemed obvious that the circumstances could readily develop into a long relationship between the two young men. That it would become sexual I knew from the reviews.But I seldom felt much of anything lovable in either one. True, they both worked hard and helped each other. What many reviewers described as Jack's furtive glances at Ennis didn't look at all libidinous to me. I thought he often looked sullen and morose. I did not see tenderness or fondness, and to this minute I don't understand what those reviewers saw that I didn't.(Perhaps I project my own prejudices into the story. My experience is, that love builds slowly, by baby steps. A pleasing attitude, a caring demeanor, perhaps a small act of compassion observed discretely from afar - these sort of things can trigger an interest. Then comes getting to know each other. At some point, as time together increases, shared experiences unaccountably become moments to be remembered. You get the idea; back to the story.)Weeks of  virtual isolation may indeed make any man horny, and if either one or both of the protagonists is homosexual, the result seems predictable. But their first sexual encounter simply looked to me like opportunistic sex, not love. A few reviewers have commented similarly, but went on to say that ""it grew into love."" I only saw two short scenes that I interpreted as love growing.Distressingly, the first was seen through the binoculars of their boss, Joe Aguirre, as the young men cavorted on the bare slope of the mountain, in a rough and tumble game of love tag,  hugging and kissing, unmistakably enthralled with each other. The other occurred many years later, during one of their ""fishing trips,"" when they jumped, naked and exhilarated, from a high bluff into the lake. I felt their joy in both scenes.Trouble was, their love had been fully formed years before the swim scene, so it doesn't count as a stepping stone to love. That leaves the first scene as the only early scene that suggested growing love. But in fact, even it occurred after the tent scene.The entire story rests on their love. If their attraction was only sexual, I don't think it could account for the ultimate, overwhelming tragedy. The author, Annie Proulx, and the screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, postulate that the young men are in love, profoundly, unfathomably  and unspeakably in love. By the end of the movie, I agree it was so. But somehow, I didn't see love start; I didn't see love grow where I thought it should have.Still, many of the reviewers said it was there. What I didn't know  (and wanted to know) was, did these reviewers sense it from watching the movie, or simply accept it as a given? It seemed to me that there was only one way to find out, so I bought the book and read it.Well, the missing love development is in the book, plenty enough to satisfy me. So what was wrong? I went and saw the movie a second time.I was wrong, thankfully wrong. Virtually everything in the book is in there, and I must admit, done to perfection. I simply hadn't understood much of what was said in the first viewing, particularly in the early scenes where Ennis and Jack get to know each other on the mountain. And of course I hadn't read the book at that point. Reading the book made all the difference in the world.In the book, after Ennis and Jack have swapped duties as herder and camp tender, Ennis comes into camp one night for what Annie Proulx calls ""a high-time supper.""  A big meal, followed by smokes and whiskey, and then talk. Annie, whose prose is amazingly lean, ticks off  a whole page of things they talk about. They must have talked for many hours (far too long for the movie). Annie says, ""They were respectful of each other's opinions, each glad to have a companion where none had been expected.""  Finally, it's time for Ennis to return to the flock:""Ennis, riding against the wind back to the sheep in the treacherous, drunken light, thought he'd never had such a good time, felt he could paw the white out of the moon.""That was the line, just a single line, that opened the door enough to let me glimpse Ennis's heart.  After an impoverished, loveless life, someone had opened up to him, made him know his feelings were important to them. I don't know how it could have been displayed on the screen (it was not). It was, after all, just his feeling, riding alone in the moonlight. To me it was the touchstone, the first baby step to love.I found many other small steps after that, benefiting greatly from having read the book. When the tent scene happened, it fit the story, at least in my mind.I was surprised by my own reaction in the second viewing. Jack came through much more powerfully and sympathetically. I actually didn't like him much the first time.And the anguish that first overwhelmed me seemed not quite so intense. Someone, in one of these posts, makes reference to ""..the moment when Ennis decides to stop hiding from life in his work, and agrees to attend his daughter's wedding."" I wish. That was a bone tossed by the screenwriters to the movie audience. Annie Proulx never wrote it. What she wrote was, ""That was about the time Jack began to appear in his dreams. Jack as he had first seen him, curly-headed and smiling..."" Make no mistake, Annie's Ennis is sentenced to haunted dreams and regrets for the rest of his life.The movie surely stands on its own, and that tiny ray of hope that Larry and Diana sent us doesn't seem to be a match for the enormity of the tragedy. I said it was not so intense the second time, but just writing about it brings it flooding back to me. No, I'm not over it yet.By the way, if I forgot to mention it, this is the finest movie I've ever seen.Bob Arr"	5.0	My Difficult Climb Up Brokeback Mountain	2006-01-20	66	60	6

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AROK11A2UXARU	Bob Rourke	"The reason ""Brokeback Mountain"" is such a powerful movie is based on what isn't said, rather than what is.None of the major characters, Ennis and Jack, and their respective wives, know how to communicate with one another or even know how to make sense of their own feelings. The inexplicable love the men feel for one another and the growing bitterness of their wives due to emotional neglect are clear to the audience, but not to the characters themselves. This lack of communication is probably a universal trait affecting everyone at one time or another.This lack of communication leads to the final bittersweet realization for Ennis that a life lived for the sake of societal approval can be an empty life indeed and that if one allows outside influences to trump love, one may be left with only memories and yearnings of a life that might have been.And yet, Ennis grows and matures from his experiences. In a particularly poignant scene, Ennis gives up an important job so that he'll be free to attend his daughter's wedding. If Ennis's inability to deal with his emotions made him a distant father while his daughter was growing up, he has finally learned to value her love and acts accordingly.A scene between Ennis and Jack's mother is also particularly touching, since the non-verbal communication indicates a bond between them -- a shared love for Jack -- while Jack's antagonistic father looks on.There are many such scenes, but it would be difficult to touch upon all of them without giving too much away for those who haven't yet experienced this film.On a different topic, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is an important crossover movie. Although there are many gay-themed comedies and dramas, they seldom hit multiplex theaters. ""Brokeback"" is different in that it is a love story with universal appeal about the nature of love more than it is about love objects. And as such, its critical acclaim and awards (with more to come) are well deserved.I have one other general comment.  From reading through some of these reviews, it is apparent (and sad) that certain homophobic people who have not experienced ""Brokeback Mountain"" and probably never will, go through these reviews so that they can secretly vote on how ""unhelpful"" all the positive reviews are to them and then vote on how ""helpful"" the very few negative reviews are to them. If such people actually sat through the movie, it is just possible that some of their hatred and some of their fear might go away. If this were to happen, would it be such a terrible thing?"	5.0	What Isn't Said	2006-01-29	26	23	3

It was Jake Gyllenhaal with whom I was not familiar with.  I sure know who he is now!  What a gorgeous guy!  His eyes, lips and smile are phenomenal!  A pure pleasure to watch on-screen.  I've watched and watched and watched Brokeback....at least 40 times, if not more, and I never tire of it.  It has to be viewed with and open mind and heart....and it helps if you're already okay with the genre.  It's too bad Jack had to die in the end....a second movie would have been nice.

Even though they must marry and settle down with kids and wives, they still feel a part of the other. It will never leave them. Though they only meet once a month or less still their love is all they have. It is a transformational story about love,rememberence and finally a totem of a shirt and jacket of the beloved which must be felt and smelled so that the one you love is still a part of you. It is about loneliness of memories of wonderful good-byes with a smile looking back waiting for the next meeting (a beautiful ending of the film). Until finally...The cinematogaphy is a masterpiece of bucolic landscapes anda beautiful scorce which adds a great deal of the emotional underlining of the two Ennis and Jack. A masterpiece of direction by Ang Lee who through his art ""paints a portrait of a love that will not die"", a love who is a part of you and cannot live without even if all you have are beautiful and sad memories and a shirt and jacket.I don't care if this film wins an oscar or two-- it is a new standard in film making when it does not mater who you love just truely love them.

Unable to visit the theatre, I eagerly awaited it's arrival on DVD. Being the center of so much controversy, I couldn't wait to see the movie and decide for myself. I am truly amazed. Heath Ledger pulled off his most amazing performance in this film. And Jake Gyllenhaal...wow...I admit I haven't seen many movies of his but I will now. Brokeback Mountain has to be one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen. The subject of the movie has made some of my family members a bit uncomfortable when I've expressed my desire to see it but I've never seen such a beautiful story. The emotion throughout the entire movie was so strong...I was moved to tears several times (and that does NOT often happen to me during movies) The conflicts, the passion, the obvious love the two felt for each other..so wonderfully portrayed by the actors made the movie all the more amazing. And the ending! Oh! I won't give anything away...but the shirt..that's what got me. Thinking about it even now, almost two hours later, tears. Such a beautiful movie. Everyone should see it.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A136O53RBLMHSL	BOYWAY	"Mr. Lee has directed a romantic masterpiece for the 21st century with the magnificent Brokeback Mountain, creating an instant classic. A story that could possibly shock due to the two men looking and behaving as typical family men involved with women and children...who fall hard for each other. The perfectly cast leads not only excel in their acting but capture the essence of the intensely passionate relationship that seemingly develops out of the blue between two handsome,masculine,rugged cowboys hired to manage a flock of sheep in a spectacularly majestic mountain setting. An environment so outrageously romantic and isolated that it's impossible to imagine resisting any kind of attraction from occuring...between any two human beings.This beautifully handled film allows anyone who watches it to identify with the emotions of erotic attraction,electric passion, tender romance,internal conflict,dramatic tragedy and life changing loss that are a big part of the human experience. The elegant, leisurely pace and classic-mythic-cinematography heightens the gut-wrenching story as it unfolds.A stunning achievement in all catagories that sets a new standard for cinematic love-story-telling for the 21st century. A classic love between opposites that anyone can relate to and identify with ,opposites not in gender, but in personality and spirit. One cowboy is the optimistic extrovert who wants it all with his man by his side and the cowboy he falls for, is the emotionally tortured intovert....who owns the film from his first shot. Mr.Gyllenhaal and Mr.Ledger's on-screen couple has become a modern legend. It'll be a long time before anyone will be able to out do this work by a pair of intelligent, brave, extremely secure and gifted actors at the peak of their craft....who really understood and felt the characters and the difficulty of this very complicated, highly emotional situation. How fantastically refreshing to see homosexual desire portrayed by two very believably masculine young men with absolutely no trace of any theatrical, selfconcious, Will & Jack style-""gay"" mannerisms. And in doing so, showing the world that there are plenty of ""regular"" men discreetly enjoying the ""power of love/lust"" privately with each other right under everyone's noses! Wishing Mr. Ledger's soul peace and love...he left us with a piece of work that will hopefully inspire people to seek  inner happiness by bravely facing one's inner, deeper truth. An important film for women to see to help them better understand those men who were never able to fully commit to them."	5.0	Cowboys in Love	2008-06-26	13	11	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A161S5PI8O24J1	"Brett Martin ""Film Fanatic"""	"At its core this film is not about sexuality; it is about profound loss and about not living a true life. Not one character comes though the other end of this without loss. And why? Not easily answered. An intolerant society and a rigid masculine template jump to mind. This film is hard to characterize, though. From its opening shot to its final one, there is an overwhelming sense of isolation and loneliness. Time passes but the outside world rarely infiltrates; some songs, some hairstyles, some newer cars but rarely the news of the day. This remoteness makes the film and its ultimate conclusion a tragedy. If there is ever a place to live a truthful and fulfilling life it should be Brokeback Mountain, but neither Jack Twist, nor especially Ennis del Mar, can truly live the life they fundamentally desire. As it stands, theirs is a mingled life that spans many years and yet still seems empty and devoid. I cannot say truthfully that the actions of these men are without criticism especially with how they affect others in their lives but nothing they do to other people compares to what they do to each other. While theirs is a timeless love, both physically and spiritually, they also are haunted with melancholy and emptiness; a troubled human conflict that will shake most loving people to their core.As a film it is remarkable. Ang Lee's direction is a masterly and will be studied. Every image, every performance and edit is delicately and masterfully maintained throughout. The performances are amazing and for some will be career defining. Ledger is revelatory and I would stand his performance alongside any of Brando's early ones. You know Ennis. You love him and are angry with him and Ledger is never false in his portrayal. Gyllenhaal is just as amazing. Jack is the yin to Ennis' yang and Jake nails him. Without his character's love for life, the final scenes would not carry as much emotionally. Jake's performance is focused in his eyes and the sparkling flame within them. Watching that flame diminish over time is heartbreaking. Michelle Williams' Alma has deservedly received accolades and she is raw and real. Just as noteworthy is Anne Hathaway and I must say she really surprised me. In what could have been a mannered and arch character, she brings Lureen startlingly to life, most notably in her phone conversation with Ennis. The photography and music are beautifully intertwined and will stir your emotions and haunt you for days.That this film is subjected to trite and hateful degradations by some is saddening. It seems at conflict with the truth and compassion that these ""moral"" people aspire to. To spout vitriol about this film seems so misplaced if anyone has truthfully seen it. It is this hate, however, that hits to the core of what Ennis believes. That no matter how fundamentally real Ennis' and Jack's feelings are for one another, there will be those that hate them and being hated is a more unspeakable horror than living alone."	5.0	Modern Tragic Masterpiece	2006-04-14	59	48	11

Having now experienced the film for myself, I can testify to you here that this is very simply not the case.Ang Lee has crafted the one feature film that audiences will be discussing for many long years to come. The buzz it generates, contrary to what some may otherwise believe, will not cater to the media's recent and over-exaggerated abuse of the words ""bravery"" or ""courage."" Especially not as such terms relate to Jake Gyllenhaal or Heath Ledger and their joint decision to star in this production. More specifically, I tend to believe that most of the talk ""Brokeback Mountain"" promotes will more than likely entail just how openly honest and heartfelt its story of true love really is. Director Lee is the one man who should be labelled brave. He, working directly from the Annie Proulx short story, has given us a revolutionary firsthand view of a deeply-rooted relationship that was, for the time period it was set against, considered gravely taboo. The year 1963, one must remember, was far and away removed from the tolerable climate of today's modern society. I had not been alive to experience the sixties, I grant you. But that doesn't necessarily mean I am unable to identify with the altogether cruel strife these characters endured. The heinous societal pressure hanging over Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist cuts to the very core of what each and every gay person across this world has been forced to confront. Director Lee, with this film, has shined an ever-revealing light upon the ignorance of bigotry and the unfortunate lengths its victims must travel to avoid the rejection of friends and family. We feel the angst within Jack and Ennis, their sheer emotional passion and, ultimately, the genuine frustration of realizing they can never openly embrace their mutual attraction. It all comes down to fear. You should never be afraid to love another person, regardless of whether a total stranger agrees with it or not. My entire adolesence had passed me by before I realized that truth for myself at the age of twenty one.I and my spouse of fourteen years were in a theater, way out in the suburbs, on opening day to experience this film amongst a packed house with varying cross-sections of people young and old alike. Not a single one of them, I should mention, got up and left throughout the entire showing. There are simply no sufficient words for me to adequately describe just how powerful and totally touching this movie's driving message proved. In my entire life, I cannot recall a time I ever saw so many members of the crowd as positively touched as they were by ""Brokeback Mountain."" This is clearly one feature film that everybody should award its proper due. It may not change the minds of those who unfortunately still shun homosexuality in general. But, I can almost certainly guarantee, that it will open many eyes to a truth that those in higher authority still choose to ignore. Love, no matter how you may look at it, is what it is and is never wrong.I will be recommending this movie to everybody I know for as long as the air in my lungs will permit me to do so. It deserves every one of the nominations it has received and is a definite contender for Best Picture.

Absolutely! This movie shows what true love is to human beings, and despite the fact that the women in this movie suffered, the female viewers of this movie are not offended. Most of whom even commented that Jack and Ennis should be together.If even women aren't offended, why should we men get squimish because of some sex scene between two guys? People who say these scenes are not suitable for straight people are only sounding that they are uncomfortable with their own sexuality.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3EW2L59UBHQSG	Bruce Aguilar	At the heart of Brokeback Mountain is a love between two people that can never be fully realized because of societal pressures.  Unfortunately, I never once believed these two people were in love.  We are shown very little tenderness and love between the two.  Mostly we see them rough housing, working or just hanging out together.  Their sexual encounters and make out sessions are full of aggressive desire but very little actual love and tenderness.  How this relationship lasts as long as it does is beyond me.  What draws them together besides lust is never shown.  In fact we never see a realtionship form, it sudenly and out of nowhere just comes to be.  People just don't have relationships like this.  Not even in 1962.The film is photographed beautifully and acted superbly, but without the central love the film revolves around I was left feeling disinterested.  Perhaps someday we will see a film that represents gay realtionships a realistic light, but Brokeback Mountain is certainly not the one.	2.0	Broke Story	2005-12-29	90	26	64

It is not a gay cowboy movie but a universal love story about two people in love and the price that is paid for that love.  It is about conforming to society instead of being true to oneself and the consequences to that for all the people involved in lives such as those portrayed. Ledger and Gyllenhaal pulled it off in spades. You actually feel for the characters they have created and feel the love they have for each other.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3JPFWKS83R49V	"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey"""	"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a film based on a story of the same name, written by author E. Annie Proulx. This controversial film received quite a bit of talk when it was first released and it was the subject of many jokes by comedians of all types. The idea of two cowboy types who fall in love while working at a mountain ranch was just too irresistible to many and it made Brokeback Mountain the common [...] (no pun intended) of many jokes.Today, many months after its initial release, much of the hoopla has died down. Brokeback Mountain has now been released on DVD and this provided me my opportunity to watch this movie and see what the fuss was all about. I already knew the film received rave reviews and it was nominated for many Oscars, taking home three of them before the Academy Awards wrapped up the 2005 awards evening. But would Brokeback Mountain live up to the hype, I wondered, or would it be an idiotic mess of unrealistic events, stupid one- liners, and a case of ""pushing"" an issue (in this case, gay themes and rights) on the viewer?Now that I have watched this movie in its entirety, I am happy to report that Brokeback Mountain contains none of the negative qualities I described above. Director Ang Lee presents a movie that is tastefully made and that doesn't push any social agenda. Yes, the film does portray many adult scenes (like gay sex and straight sex), but it is done in as tasteful a way as possible. What takes place in this movie is probably not very far- fetched at all for the time period that it covers (1963 to 1981) and there are likely many viewers who will be able to relate directly to the plot of this movie and the confusion and frustration felt by its lead characters and their families as they struggle to sort out their feelings. Ennis and Jack have obvious feelings for each other but they feel they must keep their affair secret. They have families to support and they want to be seen as ""normal"" by those around them. Jack is more aggressive and he pushes Ennis to join him and start a permanent relationship. But Ennis resists and the strain it places on them and their respective families is significant and the emotional pain on the screen is openly visible.Ang Lee does a superb job directing this film and its no surprise that he won the Oscar for Best Director. The cinematography is excellent, with great scenes of the vast Rocky Mountains as they majestically pierce the bright blue skies above them. The direction he takes this film is nearly flawless as it follows the two main characters on their path from lustful attraction, to emotional involvement, to resistance and beyond. Intertwined are the problems experienced on the home front. Both men get married and start families, in spite of their obvious attraction to each other. Like many people during that era, they probably did this because it was assumed to be the right thing to do. But the difficulties it causes their two families are obvious, with Ennis' character experiencing the greatest domestic turmoil of the two. Not only does Ennis get divorced, he even allows himself to get involved in another relationship with a woman; this, in spite of the fact that he knows where his true interest and feelings lie.Heath Ledger plays Ennis Del Ray and his performance is near perfect. Ledger is only twenty- six years old but he plays the part of a man who is (at the end of the movie) in his forties. The make- up, the talk, and the attitude that Ledger projects into this character are very real and it's easy to see why he, too, was nominated for an Oscar. It took me a while to get used to Ennis' voice because he talks like someone with a hunk of chewing tobacco in his mouth. I had to replay some of the scenes to pick up on what he was saying. But the character was like this for a reason, most likely to make him similar to those who work in this type of occupation. Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Jack Twist, is very different from Ennis. He is more of a straight talker who says exactly what is on his mind and proceeds to work toward his goals. Gyllenhaal's performance isn't quite as good as Ledger's but it is still notable and still memorable.One thing I noticed about Brokeback Mountain is that it took me some time to warm- up to the main characters. They seemed so distant and casual about the whole thing at first that it was difficult to care what was going on. I found myself feeling more sympathetic toward the families who had to deal with the volatility of their respective fathers/husbands on a daily basis. However, as the film nears its end, the frustration felt by Jack and the stubbornness of Ennis got me more involved with the characters. I just wanted them to finally make up their minds one way or the other and it was much easier at this point to feel the frustration felt by Jack as he tried to persuade his friend that he wanted their relationship to be more than just a seasonal fling.Brokeback Mountain is a very good motion picture that will be remembered for years as one of 2005's best pictures. The cinematography, the performances, and the directing are all top- notch and the story of forbidden love is engaging and vivid. The film will likely remain controversial for its subject matter but regardless of your own personal feelings on this type of subject, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a film I recommend watching. It presents a realistic look at what people who lived this life often experienced back when alternative lifestyles weren't as accepted as they are today."	4.0	Two Cowboys, Multiple Lives	2006-05-19	51	45	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2HVL9KBM7LVZ4	B. Vander Eyk	I loved this film. I have always been a big E. Annie Proulx fan and the movie certainly did her short story (of the same title) the proper justice.Aside from the absolutely breathtaking cinematography and perfectly customized soundtrack, this film encompasses the turmoil and heartbreak of an impossible love story. It is sad and touching and yet also a harsh reminder of the current of prejudices that comes up hard against homosexual/homosocial behavior.I praise Jake Gyllenhall and Heath Ledger for their performances. They managed to be both passionately sexy and boyishly uncertain in their characters...tough and yielding simultaneously. I imagine they have done the author of this story proud. There was very little deviation from the original text, which, unfortunately, is a rarity. In my humble opinion, it will be difficult for either of these actors to top what they have done here. Bravo. Highly recommended.	5.0	Poignant, Remarkable	2006-05-15	28	23	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AYHZ8IB36MQVM	B. Wheelton	"This movie was based on a short story and Ang Lee pads it to movie length with the longest, slowest introduction.  Beautiful though the Wyoming scenery is the action was like watching paint dry.  A pair of bi-sexual shepherds leave the sheep to their dogs and cayotes and keep warm (very warm)when they discoverlove in a tent.  Heath Ledger (Ennis)maintains an expressionless face, but Jake G's (Jack Twist) beautiful eyes speak volumes.Ennis's only show of emotion that is not based on passion is for his teenage daughter, Alma Jr. His complete lack of compassion, or even decent concern for his long suffering wife makes him an unsympathetic character.  One of the best scenes is the Christmas dinner at Jack Twist's home, where his abominable father in law LB Newsome tries to assume control by carving the turkey.  Jack reveals true backbone, wrests control of the carving knife and the television switch, but later pays with his life.Question:  Why does the employer of the shepherds continue to give the pair employment when he sees by binoculars evidence of ""stemming the rose"" instead of minding the sheep?"	3.0	Brokeback Mountain slow, slow, quick quick, slow	2006-01-31	39	5	34

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2AHQ50FLYP63T	Calvin Ashton	I think too many people are looking at this movie just to find flaws in it to criticize about. As much as critics say that they are not homosexual, this is just a bad movie, the truth is that this movie demonstrate true mastery of humanity. In fact, it is so good that critics let some church's homophobic propaganda get the best of them. This movie has it all: heart-felt storyline, beautiful cinematography, story dynamic, and turn of events. The only thing it lacks is punk band making horrible noises in the background, and immature actors doing stunts on screen which, by the way, is actually a good thing. You can love this movie, or hate it, but in the end, you have to admit that this is the best movie made in the last decade, particularly considering that this movie did not throw in hundreds of millions of dollars.	5.0	Love it, Hate It, Still the Best	2006-06-04	16	11	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2E3F04ZK7FG66	calvinnme	"This film is about love lost for the sake of keeping up appearances that, in the end, just makes everyone involved miserable. Ennis and Jack are two young men who spend the summer of 1963 herding sheep in Wyoming on an isolated mountain in Wyoming. Ennis is the strong silent type in the Gary Cooper tradition, while Jack is more outgoing. During the two months they are together they become friends and then lovers. Had the time and place been different, they would have probably stayed together, based on the powerful scene in which they go their separate ways after that first summer. However, with the culture being that of the rugged mountain west and the time that of the early sixties, this was an impossibility. The reaction of their boss and Ennis' wife when they discover what is going on tells you what they could have looked forward to if they had been open about their relationship - muted ostracism by daylight, perhaps violence come nightfall. At first, the two just try to put their feelings for each other behind them. Ennis, already engaged, goes through with his marriage as planned and fathers two daughters. Jack goes back to Texas, meets and marries the daughter of a wealthy farm equipment dealer, and fathers a son. Four years after their initial separation, Jack returns to Wyoming and their relationship picks up where it left off - still a secret, this time on the pretext of week-long ""fishing trips"" they take two or three times a year for the next fifteen years, never able to tell anyone about their love, never able to show their affection in public. Many have mentioned that the two were just cheating on their wives all of this time, but the fact is if they had been able to follow their hearts, they would have never had wives to begin with.Much of what is great about this film is what is left unsaid. Is Ennis actually homosexual or did he just fall in love with someone who happened to be a man? Did Jack die the way his wife said he did or he way Ennis imagined? Did Jack lie to Ennis that last time they were together and say he was having an affair with a woman because he knew Ennis would be jealous of another man but not another woman? Did Jack deliberately take Ennis' shirt as a reminder of him that first summer or did he just find it and decide to keep it? The acting is tremendous, and I find myself mourning the tragedy of the characters in this film as though they were real people, although I'm sure their situation represents many real ones past and present. This is a beautiful and thoughtful film that definitely should have won the Best Picture Oscar. Jack and Ennis' double lives just leave themselves, their wives, and everyone else who is close to them feeling empty and just add up to time and opportunity lost. Only the unwritten rules of society and conformity come out the winner in this one."	5.0	This tragic and powerful love story will haunt you	2007-05-06	18	16	2
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ANMJJITAF8PUG	"Cambel ""cambel"""	After watching this movie friends and I spent the next few hours discussing it.  It is a well done film no matter the subject, it is the story of two people in love who ache for each other and yet are forced to be apart.  Add to that the fact that both are men and the time is 1963 and you get the added story that makes this film particularly wrenching.  Jack and Enis meet when they are both hired to spend the summer up on Brokeback mountain tending to a herd of sheep.  Enis is quiet to the point of seeming almost mute and Jack is the more lively of the two.  One frozen night when huddled in the tent from the cold their supressed passion for each other becomes an irrisistable force and the two spend the remainder of their time on the mountain happy, or at least as happy as Enis's character can be.  Their summer ends with Jack saying that they could still be together and Enis being overcome with rage at the mere suggestion.  They last see each other as Jack is driving off and Enis is nonchalantly walking down a dirt street.  It is after Jack is gone that Enis breaks down in an unexpected and powerful scene, hiding in an ally-way so nobody will see.  Over the next several years they both marry and become fathers.  The scene of their reunion 4 years later has so much emotion, longing and passion that it will take your breath away.  They way they look at each other and that first kiss is one of the most powerful I've seen onscreen and I have to comend both actors.  This movie however is not just about Jack and Enis, but also shows the effect on their wives, Michelle Williams of Dawsons creek does an amazing job of playing the wife of Enis who discovers his secret but stays quiet because she sees no other option and Anne Hathaway saying Good-bye to her Princess Diary character with a flirty agreesive character and a topless scene as she sets her sight on Jack.  I won't go into the ending other than to say that the scene where Jacks parent are introduced is nearly as moving as their reunion scene and will leave you feeling wrung out.This is a film that will keep you invloved until the last credit on the screen goes blank and kudos to Ang Lee for putting such a memorable film onscreen.	5.0	Tears at your heart	2005-12-22	1034	894	140

But, I've also had a relationship with my best friend (a woman in another state), and this movie made me realize that I'm Ennis and she's my Jack and that what we have between us is even more than my marriage. Luckily, my husband understands.For those of you who have not experienced a love like Ennis and Jack, I pity you. For those who have, you know the heartbreak and pain it can cause.

A beautiful film all around which boosts a beautiful and natural scenery that you will find to your enjoyment. If you care about films that are compelling and controversial because of its subject matter and excellence in acting you cannot miss this movie. It is nominated for seven Golden Globes including Best Picture and I am almost positive that it will receive a handful of Oscar nods as well. Brokeback Mountain is a gem of a movie one that really makes you think and analyze things and you will find this film is a story that is very much a part of the society that we live in because this sort of thing happens more often that we tend to think.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2FNA5903D9E6Y	Carol Toscano	"There are certain things that hit the viewer immediately the first time you see this film - the beauty of the landscape for one thing. And then there are these two young men who instantly strike you as solitary and singular. I must admit that I had a delayed reaction to this movie. When I walked out of the theatre, I wasn't as overwhelmed as I was a day or two later and I think the reason is because this film is one to be contemplated and thought about - a lot.First, the movie was described to me as a movie about g*y cowboys. That wasn't quite what I took away from it. Let's face it, if this were just a movie about g*y cowboy's trying to hide their lifestyle from everyone else, it would have been a completely different movie. There was something much deeper than sexuality at play - deeper on so many levels, frankly. What makes it even more reflective is that no explanations are offered for practically anything in the film. As a writer, one of the first things I learned was ""show, don't tell."" This is most definitely a ""show, don't tell"" film. One of the bigger questions I was left with (and still wonder about today) is why Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) was so stricken with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). You are left wondering what would have happened had Jack never reached for Ennis's hand in the tent that night - if they had just completed their sheepherding jobs and moved on. Would Ennis's life with his wife and kids have moved forward in the way that it had been going if Jack had not sent a postcard four years later? As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Jack is more interested in men than women but you are never quite sure with Ennis (sometimes very sure and other times not sure at all). He doesn't pursue other men. There are no suggestions that he even looks at other men. There are scenes (before the postcard arrives) that leave you feeling that he is, in fact, in love with his wife and children. He even goes so far as to display some very macho behavior when some low-lifes at a fair use foul language in front of his ""girls."" When he gets divorced, he dates another woman, though you do feel that he's not fully ""present"" in that situation either. His unraveling as the years go by is all about Jack and it's almost as if his only reason to live are for his stolen moments with Jack on Brokeback Mountain. When he loses Jack for good, he is so emotionally shut down, that he nearly chooses to miss his own daughter's wedding.Jack, on the other hand, displays a clearer sense of self from the beginning. He is the more openly sensitive of the two, more skillful at getting needs met and taking initiative. More expressive in every way. But, as with Ennis, his life is fueled by their meetings on Brokeback Mountain, with a few detours along the way. There are questions left in your mind about Jack as well - it's never fully clear why he chose to marry since he seemed to have a sharper awareness of who he was and what he needed. And yet, he does seem smitten when he first meets his wife and has his baby. Was he just a product of the time and place he lived in (1960s Texas)? Could be. But this is all just part of what makes this movie so brilliant. You find yourself experiencing the film emotionally, not just watching it and that's very surprising (and somewhat disorienting) in a way. And, as with real life, there are so many unanswered questions - about ourselves, the world, life, death - that are never resolved.For the people who say that this is just Hollywood's attempt to ""legitimize"" or ""glamorize"" homosexuality - dudes, listen up: it's about the suffering these men went through and how awful their lives had become over time. There's nothing glamorous about any of it - just a lot of pain and misery. I never felt that the movie was pushing any type of lifestyle. It's just a story about two men in a certain time, place and situation and should be viewed that way.Ang Lee is an amazing director. Annie Proulx who wrote the short story that evolved into this film is the Pulitzer Prize winning author of The Shipping News. I believe Brokeback Mountain appeared in the New Yorker Magazine in 1997 or 1998 (fairly recent). I often wonder what she felt when she wrote this. The casting was spot on - Heath Ledger is an exceptional actor, no question (he gave a powerful performance in the film, The Order) but it is Jake Gyllenhaal who, for me, carried this film in a way that stirred up my insides (I was on his emotional ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" rollercoaster).I recommend this film, though I know it might not be for everyone (I hear that it's been banned in Utah, actually). And if you have that ""not sure"" feeling at first, I can guarantee that it will eventually settle. You won't be able to stop thinking about it for a long time."	5.0	Hauntingly reflective	2006-01-21	26	25	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ABZMEHB9VMKJY	"Caron Daly ""Caron"""	"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***I absolutely loved this movie. It touched my heart and soul in a profound way.It stayed with me for days and I could not stop mulling it over in my head. I have been trying to analyze why I (and others, from what I have been reading in chat boards etc.) have been experiencing such an intense reaction. Here is a partial explanation, from my point of view. I think that most people have experienced at one point in their lives, the intense, aching, longing love for another that cannot be fully realized, for whatever reason, as skillfully portrayed in Brokeback. This feeling touches the core of one's being and that feeling was palpable between the lead characters in Brokeback, even though it was not always explicitly expressed. The brilliant conveyance of such emotion is a tribute to the director and lead actors. My sense is that deeply connecting with the audience is what most serious actors and directors continually strive for in their work. To attain it to this extent is remarkable and laudable and what makes this movie ""great."" A few random observations: While watching the movie, I had hoped that Ennis would open up and express his affection and feelings more readily. Upon reflection, though, I have realized that such emoting would not be true to the character, who was conflicted, fearful and raised in a environment that was not generally hospitable to men expressing themselves in such a manner, especially with another man. The lack of verbal expression, though, did not prevent the feelings from being conveyed, at least to the audience. Also, I was surprised how strongly I felt for Ennis' wife and how difficult it must have been for her to live in the situation, knowing what she did. I also could feel Jack's frustration, due to the fact that he was more ready and less inhibited than Ennis to move forward with their relationship.I left the theater somewhat morose, but took away an uplifting life lesson as well, which was the central message of the movie, for me. That is, to not let fear inhibit love in your life, in whatever form it may appear."	5.0	This is one of the best love movies in history!	2006-02-07	23	16	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A22BWHNFE13GNC	"Caryn ""legalchic"""	"I am surprised at my reaction to this movie - because it was an intensely emotional one and the movie, which I've seen a few times since first seeing it last week on DVD, is haunting me. Having read other reviews, I'm not alone.  Ang Lee, you have created a masterpiece of story telling, of love, loss, tragedy, that has moved me like no other movie I have ever seen - thank you.I didn't know anything about the movie prior to seeing it (on DVD) other than the ""gay cowboy"" rhetoric.  I didn't know the story, how it would end, or how truly tragic it would be. How gut-wrenchingly tragic.  This is not a ""gay cowboy movie"" and to call it that demeans and belittles the movie, the acting, and the many messages that people (judging from the reviews here and elsewhere) are taking from it.  For me, a straight woman, it made me realize that to keep yourself emotionally stilted, guarded and otherwise repressed can ruin your life, and those of the people around you.  The movie made me realize that we MUST be true to our own hearts and to ourselves and to not allow fear (in whatever form - society, family, hurt, etc.) to dictate the path our lives take.For all of Jack's wanting, Ennis just could not give of himself and it is he who dictates their relationship (or lack thereof).  What Ennis witnesses at such an early age left such an indellible ane permanent print on his psyche that he is never able to get beyond it.  Of course, the heart wants what it wants, so when he meets and falls for Jack, to say Ennis was conflicted is an understatement.  While up on Brokeback, Ennis can allow himself to be opened up and to be free to be someone other than who he was raised to be, and who he turned out to be through earlier circumstances.  He can, away from the rest of the world, be happy.  Jack, who it seems knows who he is and is accepting of that part of himself, is able to draw Ennis out of himself.  When Ennis learns that they are to bring the sheep down a month early, and goes off to be by himself, I found to be a very poignant moment, because he realizes that, putting aside losing a month's pay, he must leave the one happiness he's known in his life up to that point, up on that mountain, far earlier than he was prepared to do emotionally.  Coming down from the mountain meant that he had to leave that part of himself that for the first time truly knew happiness, joy, and love.  ""One shot thing"" after all and Ennis parts with Jack believing that it's over, and that he'll go on the with the rest of his life as planned.  When he breaks down on the side of the road, you know that for him, it'll never be over, because (I think) he realizes that Jack will always be a part of him, and no matter what he may do for the rest of his life, Jack will always be a presence.I won't go through the rest of the movie, since we've all seen it and I'm just restating the plot.  However, there were a few other scenes which are remarkeable in both their on-screen intensity and their impact on the story itself -When Jack and Ennis see each other for the first time in 4 years, when they first embrace, and then let their repressed emotions and lust come bubbling to the surface, and when for the first time, Ennis is in a place where they can be easily discovered - I mean, they are right outside his front door, in the back of a laundry mat - not like people won't happen by. And then he stops, realizing that he's not in control anymore, and regains control and goes upstairs to introduce his love to his wife, who of course has witnessed the encounter - I thought that was an incredibly powerful scene with the three actors.Another is when Ennis learns of Jack's death.  I didn't know Jack dies and I'm sorry I didn't read the story first because I was not prepared.  That was a sucker punch.  Then next punch was when Ennis was in Jack's closet and he finds the two shirts.  The last, of course, and one I was NOT at all prepared for, was the last scene with Ennis looking at the two shirts and the post-card, with tears stinging his eyes, saying ""Jack, I swear ..."" and the door closes (very symbolic) and the music (another important component to the story telling) takes us to black ... that didn't punch me in my gut, that punched me in my heart.  To see Ennis standing there, knowing that the one happiness he would ever know in his life, is gone, is dead, and will never ever come back, and knowing that his life will forever be unfulfilled, unrealized, and that he is doomed to never again be truly happy, is the most powerful moment on film I have ever seen.I've seen many good movies that have moved me to tears and made me stop and think. But Brokeback makes them pale in comparisson.  I am quite awestruck at the response I've had to this movie, but I am at the same time grateful for the experience of it, because this movie has opened up a part of me that I long ago closed the door on. No, I'm not gay and that's not the kind of door I'm talking about.  I am a very guarded person and I heavily identified with that part of Ennis - which has made me stop and re-examine myself and my motivations for the choices I've made.  I've not seen a movie or read a book that has ever had such a profound affect on me.A word about the performances.  I'm sorry, and this is not to take anything away from any of the other Oscar nominated performances this year - but Heath and Jack should have won co-best actor awards.  Without their performances, this movie would not have been what it is. These two actors really made me believe that their characters were in love, without ever once using those words.  And Ang Lee is a brilliant director to have been able elicit that kind of emotion and intesity and to put a movie on screen that has so deeply and profoundly touched so many people - regardless of gender or sexual orientation.I do wish there were a few more moments of tenderness between Jack and Ennis - such as the one when Jack is having a flashback to the camp fire when Ennis comes up behinds him and holds him for a moment, although I don't know if I could have handled the ending if there had been.  I would like to have been privy to their love expressed in a simple embrace, a quick kiss, or some other obvious, yet understated way. I'm wondering if scenes such as these were deleted.I hope that there will be a director's cut of this movie in the future - I'd like to see what Ang Lee had to cut in order to make this movie mainstream-ready.To close, I'll just say that this movie really did break my heart."	5.0	Brokeback Broke My Heart	2006-04-11	16	14	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3SUD7WHS9KI57	Cassie W.	"There are many definitions of love. Love is terrifying and exciting and unexpected and heartbreaking and tender and so hard, all at once.  It's surprising and lawless and forbidden and passionate and so wrong, but so right.  And with the release of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, director Ang Lee brings to the screen a film that, at its core, is about this kind of love--the kind that won't take no for an answer, the kind you can't help but fall into, and the kind you can't quit even if you want to.Heath Ledger's Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist are young when they meet in a dusty parking lot in a small town deep in the heart of Wyoming. They're both down on their luck, looking for work, and tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain seems like the perfect way to make a buck. Ennis is quiet, resilient, a man of few words; Jack is a self-proclaimed ""crazy rodeo cowboy"" who loves to break the rules.  Neither of them expects to fall in love in the wilderness, but up on Brokeback Mountain, they're drawn to each other; their souls connect, and they are both struck by the powerful spark that is ignited within them. Their love affair spans twenty years, through marriages and divorces and children.  Three or four times a year, they meet on Brokeback Mountain...and for the week or so they are away from the rest of the world, it's like they never left.  They talk of buying a ranch, settling down somewhere together and living the quiet life of lovers.Sadly, though, Brokeback Mountain is the only place their love can live.  In the West of 1963, homosexuality made you a target--and the stakes were high.  As a young boy, Ennis himself witnessed the brutal results of a hate crime committed on a farmer who lived quietly for many years with his partner.  It's understandable, then, why Ennis is frightened by the depth of his feelings for Jack, while Jack keeps naively hoping for more than Ennis can give.  BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is their love story, the tale of a love doomed to fail--but a love so beautiful and powerful it makes all the heartbreak worth it.Heath Ledger is brilliant as the reserved, stoic Ennis Del Mar.  His performance is sensual and emotional and passionate; his character is deftly layered and breathtakingly acted.  Jake Gyllenhaal is also phenomenal as innocent, eager Jack Twist.  He plays a man seemingly untouched by the baggage of the world; Ennis renews him, and he also breaks his heart.  Both Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway give commendable performances as the wives of the two men.  The movie is brilliantly acted.But if it's brilliantly acted, it's even more brilliantly directed.  Director Ang Lee's film is atmospheric and poignant.  Ang Lee acknowledges that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was preceded by a controversial reputation; and he uses that reputation to his advantage, creating simple scenes that are, somehow, rife with sensuality.  The film builds up to one explosive moment, the crescendo of rapture, and then slowly changes into something even more incredible as love replaces the initial release of passion.  Many scenes are lump-in-your-throat emotional:  Ennis's breakdown in a roadside culvert, the passionate reunion after four years apart, the moment Ennis finds a shirt he thought he'd lost years ago.  And one of the nicest things about the film?  It's not political.  It could have been, but Ang Lee maneuvers his controversial topic in a much better direction.  It's a love story, plain and simple.  It's not a love story about two men...it's just about love.  And that's freakin' awesome.BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a film you experience, not just watch once while chowing down on popcorn and Junior Mints.  The scenery is noble and gritty and breathtaking; the performances are heartwrenching; the score is perfect; the love story is transcendental and timeless.  BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a cinematic masterpiece, a love story that will singlehandedly redefine its genre, and will change how films are made forever after."	5.0	A love story that redefines the genre--and redefines cinematic experience itself	2006-01-20	24	21	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2671J7KYLAE5I	"Castle Keeper ""Binny"""	"Please let me begin by saying that I honestly feel we are entitled to love whomever we choose to love - regardless of gender.  Love being the focus here, I must say that I did not see love in this movie - with the exception of Alma's (Michelle Williams) love for Ennis and of course, her little girls.  It was with great anticipation that I watched this movie, and I was left greatly disappointed.  In my humble opinion, this movie was all about lust.  I think we are all so caught up in the hype of this tale that we fail to see the raw, somber message that is delivered.Jack is obviously attracted to men, and Ennis is caught up in a moment of weakness.  It is almost as if Ennis is unable to stop himself time after time.  Though Jack seems interested in only Ennis, we are led to believe that he continues to seek male companionship, with or without Ennis.I believe we are fascinated by this story because it is so unique; 1960s sexual encounter between two ""macho"" cowboys that continues for 20 years.  And sexual encounter is all that it is.  The shirt scene has the potential to be moving, but it leaves me cold.For those of you who adore this movie, I envy the insight I obviously do not possess in this instance."	1.0	Disappointed - And Let Me Tell You Why	2006-04-08	88	21	67

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3VIOCJZ22JZXT	C. B Collins Jr.	Ang Lee's film, Brokeback Mountain, is one of those rare events that impacts not only the entertainment industry and its supporters, but also impacts our society by revealing truths of the human heart that may run counter to society's prescriptions and rules.It is a love story beween two men that emerges out of a totally unlikely place, the cowboy world of windswept Wyoming in 1963. Yet from those first dusty scenes where Ennis del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal)are hired to herd sheep, we begin to see a beautiful world of high mountain pastures on Brokeback Mountain, where the pressures of society and civilization can be left behind and gradually these two men can shed the confines of prejudice and social roles and experience first physical and then emotional love for each other. To a certain extent, high above the world of civilization, in a more natural state, these two young men enter an Eden. It is a Garden of Eden first in its natural beauty and then second in the love that is allowed to flourish there. I use the term Eden because throughout the film, Ennis and Jack try to return there - to recapture the young love they felt for each other, and to meet their sexual needs.But civilization calls, and these two young men return to the lowlands, collect their pay, and painfully part ways. Ennis hits a brick wall with his bare fist in a hidden alley, for he is a man who is more comfortable with physical pain than emotional pain.  Jack returns to the worksite the following year, eager to relive the experience, but stopped by Randy Quaid, the foreman, as well as Ennis' decision not to show up again.Both men marry. Ennis marries a vulnerable country girl reared from the same strong stock of no-illusion people from which he was reared. Jack almost starves until he is picked by a rich cowgirl who has been denied nothing by her father. Anne Hathaway plays the wife of Jack. What is it about the man who desires other men that appears mysterious and unobtainable to some women? Part of the dynamic between Anne and Jack is that she is a young woman who has been given everything, yet she marries a man with a hidden ability to love inside that she will never be able to touch, she will only always remain aware that it is there and it is not meant for her.Michelle Williams plays Ennis' wife, Alma. Some of the most painful scenes of the film involve Alma as she gradually begins to learn the secrets of the silent man she has married. After 4 years, Jack writes a postcard to Ennis, asking if he would like to get together. Ennis responds and a date is determined. On the day that Jack is supposed to arrive, Ennis is a bundle of bad nerves, pacing, sad and fearful of a no-show, restless, depressed as a way to deal with his repressed longing, energized, agaitated at the kids, and this odd state of mind/body is certainly observed by his sensitive young wife. When Jack arrives, Ennis runs out of the house to greet him, pulls him from his truck, and the two men kiss with a flood of repressed love and lust and longing. Yet Alma opens the front door and observes this embrace and knows that this is a passion she has never experienced with Ennis.Jack Twist, played superbly by Jake Gyllenhaal, emerges as the character that is most emotionally available. He makes himself available to Ennis and is the most open to these two men divorcing their wives and becoming life partners. He is aware of his needs and has sex with other men beside Ennis. He is the one who continually pushes Ennis to experience the hidden rumblings of the heart.Ennis del Mar, played perfectly by Heath Ledger, is an emotionally more complex and stunted character. Yet it is the character growth of Ennis that in some ways is the real trajectory of the story. The trajectory of this story is not boy meets boy, boy loses boy, boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finally find boy again. It is rather a more complex path of self awareness where pain is the surgical tool that reveals Ennis to himself. He does lose Alma, he does lose Jack, but in the end we see a changed man. When an available attractive young woman begins to seduce him, he is pulled into her orbit due to his need for comfort from his loses. HOwever, he realizes he will never be happy with this young woman and she will never be fulfilled with him. He ends the budding romance in a way that tells us he has gained in wisdom and self knowledge. In the end we see Ennis as a wounded and broken fellow, destined to mourn the love he could have nourished and experienced, and yet we see him begin to celebrate the budding love of his eldest daughter.This is mature matter. We all make poor or uninformed or unconscious choices. We all treat life as if it would go on forever and we don't need to make hard choices because we will always get a second chance. These two men were not especially strong heroic fellows, they were victims of societal pressures and their own emotional boundaries and awareness. Sometimes we do our best to understand ourselves and the world and it still comes out a tragedy. Knowing this, we must be grateful for those times of communion of the heart, which come to us like grace, like an unsought gift, but which transforms us forever.	5.0	Many meanings, many messages in this elegant fable.	2006-03-13	60	50	10

However, when I saw Brokeback Mountain late in 2005, I was convinced that it was not only the greatest film of the year, but the most unforgettable film of my lifetime, and if you allow it to, this film can and will transform your life.  The performances, the haunting music, and breathtaking cinematography are the most genius I've ever seen on film.  Every movie I've seen since Brokeback Mountain has paled in comparison.  To truly understand and appreciate this work of art in cinematic history, you need a certain level of intelligence and sensitivity.  Unfortunately, we don't all have that, and we can't open our minds wide enough without being afraid.  When I left the theatre, I felt completely devastated, but soon, this was replaced with a passion for life that I'd never felt before.

I had heard many things about the movie: that is would leave me sobbing, that is was tragic, sad; most agreed it was well-deserving of it's Oscar nomination.Indeed, it was an excellent film about life, about love.  And if you have read any of my other reviews (or know me), you know that I very much enjoy films and stories that tug at our heartstrings and emotions.  Unlike Philadelphia, which left me sobbing at the end of the movie, this film was similar more so to the emotional strength of Torch Song Trilogy (minus Harvey Fierstein and some fabulous show tunes).The film takes us on a journey between 2 individuals (played well by Jake and Heath), and transports the viewer over 20 years, beginning in 1963.  The film is set mostly in Wyoming (though filmed in Canada).  It follows the emotional journey of 2 men who attempt to come to grips with their inner desires and sexuality.  After spending the summer of 1963 as ranch hands, both return to their ""normal"" lives, 1 in Wyoming, the other in Texas.  They marry, have children, and attempt to blend in with societal norms (just as some people try to do in 2006).  Years later, they reunite, and the emotional ties are even stronger.  As each year passes, they come together for a visit on Brokeback Mountain, where they first met and worked.This is not a gay cowboy film, hardly.  This IS a film about people, and how difficult it can be to care so deeply for another human being.  To love someone so much it hurts.  I am sure others watching the film like me can only hope we'll find someone in our life who will love us with so much courage and emotion.  This applies to people from all walks of life.As I watched the film, I couldn't help but think of Matthew Shepard, the young man from Wyoming who was brutally beaten and killed for his sexuality - sadly, his death occurred in 1998.  Proof our society has yet to understand the dynamics of love, set forth in this film.  After mainstream theaters decided they would cash in and show the film to general audiences (it was originally a limited release film, in ""select"" theaters), I read an article that described the ending as tragic.  I would beg to differ, and will leave that to each individual viewer.I did manage to see Crash in theaters (the film that beat Brokeback for the Oscar), and must admit, it was deserving of the award.  It was equally, if not more intense emotionally, on an far greater scale.

The tragic consequences of this loss of a sense of one's true self are what drives the ultimate sadness and unhappiness of the characters and leads them to their respective fates.It is an overwhelming passion and intense love that propels Ennis and Jack, the protagonists of the film, to defy societal convention and see each other in secret. ""This thing grabs hold of us...it has no reins,"" says Ennis. Although Ennis deeply senses that the uncontrollable urges he feels are a true and real form of love, he cannot reconcile what he feels with what he has been taught since childhood, and that has been grilled into him by an unkind, unforgiving world. Images of gay men being attacked and ridiculed constantly inhabit his thoughts. As the clandestine relationship progresses, Ennis becomes more bewildered and lost, so that by the end of the film he has accused Jack of being responsible for his feeling like ""nobody and nowhere"". He has lost any true sense of who he is, and helplessly straddles between the gay and straight worlds. He is unhappy and unfulfilled in both places. Although Jack remains closeted, he has a keener sense of himself, and has successfully erected a wall between himself and the negative opinions of others. He is willing to take risks in order to be happy, but his overpowering love for Ennis forces him to conceal his true self and seals, ultimately, his fate.At first I had conflicting feelings about the film. While overwhelmed and impressed by its incisive, understated screenplay, skillful, heartfelt performances, spectacular vistas, and precision like directing, I could not stem the feelings of anger rising up in me. Do we need another film where gay men are unhappy, unfulfilled and alone?  Do symbols like lovers' shirts or possessions have to substitute for the real thing?  I ultimately decided, however, to view this film as a depiction of, and a comment on, a particular time and place in history, and to admire its fierce courage in depicting passion between two men with insight and sensitivity. The sadness of the outcome does not diminish the beauty of the love between these two fellow human beings. It is a love that lingers in one's memory, and stabs at one's heart."	5.0	A Film of Great Insight and Sensitivity	2006-05-28	30	26	4

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3B0LXKS6YQS9A	Chad Chavers	"Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain is a new film in theatres (1 month old?) about a gay romance and is getting some pretty high reviews.this film is outrageously bad. even though the gay lisping and limp-wristed stereotype is actually found no where in this film, there are plenty of other overplayed incorrect gay stereotypes available and then some more! the most devastating feature of this film is that it basically says, ""all gay relationships are tragic and impossible."" the second part i found really gross is the reinforcement of ""how unsafe it is to be gay in this world"" in other words, that people kill fags and if you are a fag, you can be killed to, just for this reason. this is outrageous to put in a film that gay people are supporting. while this deals with a very small percentage of what gay people are going through, this is totally coloring within the lines of all gay literature (tragic death impossible circumstances, terrible endings) to actually undermine the gay community. this film is neither ground-breaking nor inspiring and the marketed plot to advertise this as a gay film is a poison pill experience. this film basically reinforces self-loathing programs for being gay.other issues of the film are it's length in general. i felt the show could have been capsized and completed tastefully in 15 minutes, but ang lee decided somewhere around 2 hrs 30 mins is better. the misperceptions emanated towards the straight audience of gay people and gay people of themselves is absolutely wrong. All gay relationships don't happen because women are not available and all gay relationships do not include or begin from alcohol and other drugs.there are really countless other incidences of debate here but this film just pisses me off.-chad chavers"	1.0	Outrageously Bad	2006-01-09	138	37	101

The period was represented amazingly well and the score and direction were also both simply great and restrained.Unfortunately this movie is way over-hyped and my main problem with it is that it asks us to sympathize with men cheating on their wives. All I could think of the whole time was how terrible they were. People think they were being ""brave"", but in reality it doesn't matter that they were gay and in love - because they were destroying other people's lives and it's not fair or noble in any way.I could only sympathize with the wives at the end of the film.Other than that fact that these characters aren't (to me) very likeable, and the aforementioned over-hype, I'd say it's very much a worth-watching quality drama."	3.0	Brokeback	2006-01-30	38	10	28

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3JPKSSN16WAUW	Chris. H. Brandy	There are a few things that contribute to the popularity of this movie.First and most importantly, it is the courage it took to make this movie. Remember, the script of Brokeback Mountain has been floating around Hollywood for ages, and everyone knows about it, just that none has the skills and courage to produce it. Even when director Ang Lee picked up this script, and turn it into a masterpiece, there are still Christian groups protesting it, imagine what happened when they were producing it! (Good thing the filming took place in Canada)Second, it is the artistic sense required to make this movie. The kind of care and effort required to create the emotions of this movie is extreme. The audiences almost all feel the great sadness and tragedy presented by the movie, yet they come back over and over gain. Imagine the artistic talent required making your audience feel bad for the majority of the movie, and they would still want to come back again and again to watch this movie!Finally, this film also demonstrates true talents of Hollywood actors. Almost everyone is sick of Hollywood for filling the movie screen with actors that have pretty faces, but are so shallow that they demonstrate no complex emotion whatsoever. This movie pulled two mainstream actors, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, and allows them to masterfully shine on the movie screen with nothing but their acting skills. Surely this is what the film industry is truly about, not just another rock fest for teenagers.This is the direction that the movie industry need to strive for, and only with movies like these can we enrich the young minds of society, and give them the correct direction towards life.	5.0	Why People Will Always Love Brokeback Mountain	2006-06-04	34	29	5

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ARPUO547WIHDA	Chris Thatcher	"Perhaps the original short story did a better job of setting up a believable attraction between these two men, but the movie setup of this relationship is unbelievable. A few minor camping mishaps and swapping mundane growing-up stories are not sufficient by themselves to justify the homosexual relationship that follows. The audience of this film is asked to suspend their disbelief and proceed past the first sexual encounter despite the fact that Ang Lee does nothing to establish the physical or emotional attraction between these two men. Whether this is a failing of the adapted screenplay, the director, or the fact that both actors are straight, I don't know. But the real story doesn't even begin until after their first purely sexual encounter. There are also some unbelievable story elements, such as: 1) the risky public kiss they share that is observed by Ennis' wife, which seems more convenient to moving the story along than a realistic depiction of what two men would risk doing in a dangerously homophobic culture; and 2) Jack's trips to Mexico for gay sex which betray the supposed love relationship we are supposed to believe he has with Ennis-- in a straight relationship we wouldn't buy this act of sexual infidelity, but we are asked to suspend our disbelief because the context is a homosexual one. Lastly, and this a purely a technical note, both lead actors' dialects are imperfect. Jake Gyllenhaal's accent is shaky and a bit unnatural at times, while Heath Ledger's ventriloquist approach leaves some of his dialogue completely unintelligible. However, this film succeeds in two areas: The beautiful cinematography and presenting an accurate portrayal of the reality of trying to maintain a homosexual relationship in a brutally homophobic culture. Ang Lee deserves an Oscar, just not for this film.

Being a straight man, I identified with Jack and Ennis in that I've often felt marginalized for various reasons.  How do you cope with that?  How do you overcome insurmountable odds?  What I really found interesting about this film is that as the story unfolds you start to see Jack and Ennis not so much as gay/bisexual men, but rather as people in love.  I can't think of any other movie that accomplishes this feat.  I do believe that Brokeback Mountain should have beaten Crash for best picture.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AP0DQSDFSLP4P	"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M"""	"""Brokeback Mountain"" has been reviewed and re-reviewed, critiqued and re-critiqued, analyzed and re-analyzed, lauded and re-lauded, and criticized and re-criticized till there is little original left to say. No matter: director Ang Lee's Oscar-winner based on E. Annie Proulx' story of unexpected but unfulfilled love between two men is a contemporary masterpiece powered by emotionally numbing performances from its two lead characters, Australian actor Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, both in Oscar-nominated turns. So raw and honest do they carry the love (and its consequences) between their characters that both Ledger and Gyllenhaal may well have cemented themselves as A-caliber leading men in their industry. Ledger's character of Ennis is the antithesis of Gyllenhaal's of Jack, the first who literally fights against the love he begins to feel for the second. Beginning in 1963 Wyoming, the film embraces nearly 20 years in the lives of the two ranchers whose attraction and love for one another blossoms but, sadly (and tragically), is never fulfilled. Following the social script of the day, both men marry and have children but continue occasionally to hook up privately through the years. When they do, the emotional power of their passion and love - and its consequences to themselves and others - is numbing. No character better portrays the potential emotional devastation of learning that a spouse is having an extra-martial affair, much less an unconventional one, than Ledger's screen wife (Michelle Williams, also in an Oscar-nominated supporting role). Together, director Ang, Ledger and Gyllenhaal give us a disarming but honest and usually painful treatment of love that, for whatever reason, is forbidden and - sadly - can't always be fulfilled. To their credit, neither Proulx, author of the story that inspired the screenplay, nor Ang gives us a neat and happy resolution. To the contrary, the finale is emotionally wrenching. We are left with the fear that one man has died as a sacrifice to a hate crime while the other is left alone, by then middle-age, and has litle more than memories of a love not fully embraced. Ledger and Gyllenhaal command respect for the courage to embrace a film that, unfortunately, has been demeaned by so-called moralists as a vehicle to ""homosexualize"" the U.S. populace. In the end, ""Brokeback Mountain"" being categorized as a ""gay movie"" does the film an injustice: using a straight couple to carry the message that love, whoever it's between, isn't always accepted could have been as effective. No ""gay movie,"" this one: it is, in the final analysis, a simple love story, and its honesty, integrity and brillant acting command respect. By film's end, we are left with a sense and the painful reality that love isn't always the Great Healer. Hence, the film's subtle warning: treat love with care; in matters of the heart, it is far too precious a commodity - and a fragile one. Controversy and moral assesments aside, if for no other reason, Ledger's incredible performance warrants catching the film. He is simply that good and awesome, and he manages to stir the basic of the deepest of human emotion."	4.0	Love and emotion at their rawest	2006-04-15	26	19	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A8FQEHKEVW04L	Christopher S. Danielsen	"""Brokeback Mountain"" the film is a perfectly faithful and reasonable adapatation of ""Brokeback Mountain"" the short story by Annie Proulx. I saw the film before I read the story, and was deeply moved and affected by it. However, I highly recommend that people read the short story in order to fill in the gaps left by this movie. Many reviewers here complain about the reticence of Heath Ledger's character, Ennis Delmar. In reading the short story I realized that Ledger's performance is true to Ennis, but this may not be fully understood without reading the story. Proulx writes in a third-person limited voice from Ennis's perspective. The story opens with Ennis waking up early in his tiny trailer, having just lost another ranching job because his boss is finally selling his property. Unemployed with no prospects, contemplating having to move in with his married daughter until he can find another job, Ennis is nonetheless happy because he has awakened from a dream about Jack. He tells himself not to demand too much of the dream, only asking that the way he feels now will last the rest of what will otherwise be another bleak day in his small life. As the events related in the film unfold in flashback, we come to understand that Ennis does not fully realize at first that what he feels for Jack is love; it takes the reunion of the two four years later for him to understand this truth, and even then he fears it as much as he allows himself to feel joy and completeness in it. The story goes on to illuminate some of the ambiguities in the film, including its ending. The only other remark I will make here is that what saddens me about this film, other than its tragic story, is that the people who really need to see it probably won't do so. I doubt the reviewer who referred to it as liberal propaganda in a one-paragraph screed has actually seen it; he could, after all, get everything he says about it from reading the reviews posted here. Those who oppose what they call the ""homosexual agenda"" fail to realize that demanding that gay people deny what they feel is infinitely more destructive and dangerous than allowing them to be who they are. If Ennis and Jack had been able to let their love flourish, the only damage to society would have been that a couple of cowboys would have lived alone on a little ranch somewhere, bothering no one. But their own preconceived notions and the expectations of their society forced them to take actions which left wounded wives and fatherless children in the wake of their own heartbreak. In Proulx's story, this is made even more clear, as Ennis is left only with dreams of Jack that sometimes help him through his day but also often leave him weeping into his pillow at night, his memories encapsulated in those dreams and a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked to the wall of his trailer, with his old shirt and one of Jack's hanging on a nail beneath it. That society would demand this kind of heartbreak of consenting adults is ugly and cruel. However, screeds like the one posted here are hopefully the last desperate gasps of fanatics who know that they have already lost, that society is increasingly coming to accept (the reviewer calls it being ""desensitized"") that deviation from the norm is not necessarily a crime or a moral failure. In the short term, ""Brokeback Mountain"" will be a celebrated film that conserve-hate-ives throw out as yet another example of Hollywood and the media's evil liberal bias. In the long term, it may be recognized as one of the milestones on society's path from bigotry to tolerance."	4.0	Read the story!	2006-01-14	10	8	2

After seeing it the first time, i had such an emotional catharsis that i have never ever before experienced with any work of art; i basically had to walk away and try to absorb my feelings and the meaning behind the sense of loss i personally felt.  it was well, all i can say is when a medium like film can move a person to tears and to stir up inner emotions so, that is a special thing.  like others, i feel protective of the movie, of these two boys, who could be to any one of us a son, brother, father, friend.brokeback mountain is like a beautiful piece of music that becomes part of your soul.  i have seen it four times in two days, and my eyes swim with tears every time, even thinking of it. . . driving to work today a song came on, and the movie fresh in my mind, i wept silently in the privacy of my car.  for jack and ennis, for loves that all of us have had at one time or another in life that we lost.others here have already and more eloquently than i described the movie and its principals.  i don't know if any observations I, a thirtysomething married white female could proffer would mean anything to anyone, so i will keep them brief.  some things that still stand out to me days later:their reunion scene.  absolutely visceral and real.  the raw emotion and hunger for one another.  it's shocking in its intensity, but anyone who has ever had a love of a lifetime absolutely gets that moment for them, when time stands still and the only people in the world that exist are the two of them.jack flashing back to their first summer on brokeback at what is to be their last meeting.  as ennis gently cradles him from behind, rocking slowly with him, the look of peace and serenity on jack's face and the longing loving look as ennis rides away, blows me away.  has ever so much been conveyed by two people?  the regret as he comes back to the present and ennis' is driving away, what could have been.  you feel the same sadness and loss for what could have been, so beautifully effectively done.thank you heath ledger and jake glyenhaal (sp?) and ang lee . . after months of being curious amidst all the buzz, seeing is believing.  i will never ever forget nor fail to be moved profoundly by your movie.  bravo.  i only hope this movie can be a bridge to understanding for ignorance and hatred.  only then can all the pain and despair suffered by the (?) fictional jack and ennis ever be not in vain.	5.0	. .  . a cathartic, visceral, beautiful, unforgettable love story	2006-04-18	62	52	10

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2YNTGYG5J5U3J	"ck123 ""ck123"""	"Overall, I think this movie was great. Ennis and Jack discover their affection for one another as they work together during the summer as sheep herders back in 1963. After they had their sexual encounter, Jack is not afraid to share his feelings. And  deep down inside, Ennis has feelings for Jack, but he rejects the idea of having a life together with Jack. He rejects the idea because he is reminded of a hate crime that occured when Ennis was a child, where a man was killed because he lived with another man. Ennis knew that society would not be ready to accept him and Jack living together either. When I saw the ending of the movie, I thought it felt awkward and left me feeling empty. And as I read in another reviewer's comments on another site, the ending is supposed to leave you feeling empty. But I think the ending fits in with Ennis's character as he still tried to be involved with his children to some extent, which happens throughout the whole movie. And I didn't think of this until today, but it's ironic at the end of the movie how Ennis's daughter announces she is going to get married, and she's all happy about it. Yet, Ennis is all alone and does not have his true love with him.I also wanted to comment on a couple other reviews I had seen on this site.One person had commented that Ennis and Jack never seemed to age over this 20 year story. On the contrary, I felt that the make up artists did a good job at making them look older, particularly with Jack having the moustache and a little bit of grey hair.Another reviewer had commented that they felt this love story was not as romantic or as endearing as they thought it would be. And perhaps it is not as romantic or endearing as you might think with having seen the previews. Although I do feel there were a couple scenes where they kissed and cuddled, which I thought was somewhat romantic. And I thought it was touching when Ennis cried after their summer of sheep herding came to an end. And it was even more touching as Ennis hugged Jack's coat towards the end of the movie. However, I think these reviewers who were expecting a highly romantic movie need to step back and think a little. This movie is NOT a ""Romeo and Juliet"" movie where everything is all romantic, poetic, and flowery. It's a movie about 2 cowboys who discover they have feelings for each other while working together as sheep herders back in 1963. Being a gay man myself, I know that when you first discover you have feelings for another person of the same sex, this can be confusing. And it certainly must be a confusing thing for 2 cowboys to have feelings for each other and not understand them. Plus the fact that this story takes place in 1963, when homosexuality is not widely discussed, and certainly not accepted by society. And just like there are varying types of love and relationships amongst straight people where some couples are romantic and others aren't so much, the same can hold true for homosexual relationships too.At any rate, this movie was well worth seeing, and I hope to buy it when it comes out on DVD! And I also hope that this helps to change society's view on homosexuality."	5.0	Touching Movie!	2006-01-08	18	12	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A15X9LORZAIDAQ	ckelly	"Truly an exceptional achievement in every way.  This film shows that we don't choose who we fall in love with.  It also shows the damage homophobia can do. My favorite scenes:1.  When Alma sees Ennis and Jack kissing outside, then they both come inside and Ennis introduces Jack to Alma and Alma meekly says ""hello""....a true heartbreaking performance by Michelle Williams.2. When Jack is driving to see Ennis after the divorce becomes final.  Jack is happily singing. Ennis can't spend anytime with him because he has his two daughters for the weekend.  THe next scene shows Jack in sharp contrast to the first one.  In this scene he is sobbing.3.  The ""Ennis why can't I quit you scene"" toward the end with Ennis' struggle to not love Jack but knowing that he can't control his emotions they both crumple down in a heap realizing that they can't ever be together.4.  Ennis and his daughter talking about her upcoming marriage towards the end of the movie.  Then, he walking into the closet and looking at Jack's shirt and postcard.5.  Jack asserting his position as the authority of his house over his jerk of a father-in-law...""This is my house, this is my child and you are my guest"".......just a great performance by Jake Gyllenhaal.There are so many dimensions to this film and so many fine scenesand all the performances are outstanding!  While I don't believe that Ledger's performance merited the Oscar (I think Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash in ""Walk the LIne""  was the male performance of the year), it is still Oscar worthy.  I believe Gyllenhaal deserved to win the Oscar although I certainly did not consider him to be a supporting actor in this movie; and Michelle Williams as Alma certainly did too she was incredible and heartbreaking!!  This film is one I will never tire of seeing over and over again!"	5.0	EXCEPTIONAL!!	2006-04-15	42	31	11

Whether you are for or against or indifferent to homosexuality, your preconceived prejudices won't stand up to this movie. When you get down to it, it's just an emotional, tragic, love story that tugs at the heart on so many levels BEYOND the homsexuality story. There are so many issues being dealt with in this movie that if you try to focus only on the ""gayness"" of it, you will miss a great message and the essential point of the entire movie.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AS558SNWF1DXG	Clare Quilty	"""I haven't seen 'Brokeback Mountain,' nor do I have any intention of seeing it,"" joked Larry David in a recent New York Times. He facetiously blamed homosexual panic -- adding, by way of explanation, that as ""a very susceptible person, easily influenced ... if two cowboys, male icons who are 100 percent all-man, can succumb, what chance do I have, half- to a quarter of a man?""He shouldn't worry, and neither should anyone else. Ang Lee's sweeping, picturesque drama might increase tourism in Wyoming, but the problem faced by the main characters doesn't seem at all an enviable predicament.They are Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal), two young cowhands who herd sheep together during the summer of 1963 and find themselves growing close in a way they vaguely understand but can't completely accept.The two enter into a sudden affair that is frankly sketched but not particularly graphic or prolonged, and as its story unfolds, ""Brokeback"" really becomes more about the time the men are apart than the time they're together. They go their separate ways and try to start families, but are shadowed for years by their guilt, secrets, lies and love.The movie is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx but it was adapted by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana and, with its windswept small towns and its confused tough guys, it certainly feels of a piece with such classic McMurtry adaptations as ""Hud"" and ""The Last Picture Show.""Ledger, an Australian actor, seamlessly fits into the role of Ennis and gives one of the year's best performances. Early on, he seems to begin each sentence with the anxiety of a man stepping onto a high ledge, and when he does speak he mumbles through a mouth distorted by a chaw of tobacco. By the end, though, he's quietly become a surprisingly deep and tragic figure.Gyllenhaal, as the more expressive of the pair, has the flashier part but is effective as well; and Michelle Williams, in a supporting role as Ennis' long-suffering wife, reveals a heartbreak that's no less real than that of the main characters.Buzz has been surrounding ""Brokeback"" since before it was released, and the praise is well deserved, but viewers might want to dial down the expectations fueled by the movie's uniformly rave reviews. Yes, this is one of the year's best, and it mines genuine sadness from situations that might've easily turned unintentionally funny -- let's face it, there's comic potential in the idea of gay cowboys, and Leno and Letterman have probably hit it all.But this is also a movie that hits its true highs with small, precise, understated ingredients such as the sight of a new number on a mailbox, or a forgotten childhood toy, or a scribbled message on a postcard, or an old shirt hanging in a closet."	4.0	A big movie built mostly on small moments	2006-01-21	14	11	3

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A32SSTX8PDDF71	"Clayton D. Thompson ""C Doyle"""	"Watching this film I was reminded of that old Alan Alda film ""Same Time Next Year"" where two people, married to others, meet the same weekend each year for a tryst that goes on for generations. In this film each character has found a happy respite from their spouce and that's enough.In Brokeback Mountain the tryst carries on for years, but for a different reason. Yes, they desire each other and escape, but in this film society places a much larger roll. If this were a man and woman they most likely would have run away together and never looked back. But they are two men in 1963 Wyoming and that simply isn't done. Their tryst stands the test of time but when you look deeper this is a character study at its best. Ultimately it isn't society that keeps them apart...it's each other. Health Ledgers character, carrying deep emotional baggage, cannot make the necessary sacrifices to achieve happiness. Even as time and society change to his advantage.What's most compelling about this story is that even though it's a time capsule, it's also timeless. These characters could exist today or twenty years from today. There are always people who find reasons to throw happiness away, and wind up inviting heart break. And even though this film is heart breaking, I recommend it for the cinematography, fantastic cast, and the always surprising unhappy ending that Hollywood is rarely brave enough to provide."	4.0	Time capsule	2006-01-13	16	12	4
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A26C6WFV19ZRLN	Clifton Snider	"Amazon.com review, 9 March 2006""Brokeback Mountain"" came as a long overdue movie exploring the lives and love of characters whose story has not been told before in a major motion picture, and the comments have been many.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed that ""Brokeback"" lost the best picture Oscar to ""Crash,"" a fine but far inferior movie.  Whereas ""Brokeback"" reveals a story that had never been told in literature until Annie Proulx published it in ""The New Yorker,"" and never in film, ""Crash"" explores issues that are extraordinarily important but that have been explored before, albeit perhaps not in the same innovative way.  Furthermore, unlike ""Brokeback,"" whose plot is poignantly and painfully real, the plot of ""Crash"" is so filled with coincidences that they nearly mar its message (and it is a message film, not one that tugs at the heart like ""Brokeback"").  I believe the Academy won't have another opportunity to vote for a film similar to ""Brokeback"" for years, if ever.  That is a terrible shame.But to ""Brokeback.""  For once the hype lives up to the film. The performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are equally well done--beautifully understated with an understanding of their characters and the love they share. Surely they deserved Oscars for their incredible work.  And the love they portray is not a love based only on sex. Their long absences heighten the sex, but their love is based on mutual attraction and compatibility: mutual ways of life, mutual interests, comfort in each other's company,--just as any love is based on these things.Having read the story before I first saw the movie, I knew about the tragic ending. However, the most moving part for me was the climax when Jack tells Ennis they could have had a life together. Because of his lack of self acceptance, Ennis had long ago ruled that life out, and the regret Heath Ledger as Ennis expresses in his final scene is heartbreaking and even more moving the second time I saw the film. I've known too many like him in my own life as a gay man.The picture is directed and filmed beautifully. The gorgeous Wyoming (Canadian) mountain scenery matches the love Jack and Ennis express there, just as Ennis's squalid apartment and trailer match the sad, alternative family life he creates in the one and the barren life his own self denial and timidity create in the other. The symbolism fits well. A magnificent movie at every level, a lasting testament to all the artists involved, from Annie Proulx, Diana Ossana, Larry McMurtry, and Ang Lee to everyone else, including Rufus Wainwright, the openly gay singer on the soundtrack.""Brokeback Mountain"" deserves all the awards it has won and all the Academy Award nominations it received and the three it won."	5.0	By Far the Best of 2005	2006-03-09	51	44	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"This movie got a large amount of controversy, all of it going to its theme: homosexuality. While it certainly feels like a breakthrough film, there have been films with the very same theme before. Most of them, however, are barely seen as they're usually arty independent movies or foreign ones. Brokeback in many ways shows that it's still a problem with people and while it may have some storytelling issues I have a problem with, it's still a solid story, it's only missing something that makes it an absolute masterpiece.In probably one of the most slowest opening 40 minutes I've ever seen, we follow Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar as they become sheep herders. Alone for a long time, the 2 act on feelings that they might love each other. Of course the problem is they're both men which is very frowned upon at the time. The 2 go home and end up leading separate lives but are very much wondering about the love that could've lasted.Flash forward 4 years and Ennis marries Alma who gave birth to 2 daughters while Jack meets Lureen and they have a son. A meeting between the 2 men rekindles their relationship and now have a decision to make: to continue in short and increasing gaps of time or call it off forever, not experiencing each other's love anymore. This of course doesn't sit well with either of them, or their wives.There will be people who probably won't like this review(or any other like it) where I don't outright praise the film for the masterpiece that it is and that I either don't ""get it"" or I'm a homophobe. I'm not gay but I don't go after them either, it's love period regardless of who's in it(although I do have problems with animal lovers and pedophiles). The film has been called groundbreaking but really it's just a love story, only with 2 men. What about movies where the underdog team actually lost instead of triumphing in a big finish? Or a crime story that has the killer actually win? Storytelling wise these could be called groundbreakers too and they've been done before as well.Acting-wise it's straight across the board with Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway proving that they can be actresses(the latter's turn in Havoc was just wasted). Jake Gyllenhaal is good as well but the biggest attention went to Heath Ledger. Granted it's a very good performance full of nuance but at the same time, he almost mumbles through the entire thing. I'm glad I put subtitles on sometimes, otherwise I wouldn't know what he was saying half the time.It's odd how the filmmakers want us to root for the love of 2 gay men despite the fact both are committing adultery, one of which is actually with 2 others, including his wife. The other actually ends up getting divorced because of it and to see the 2 men get together only to hide away their feelings and be quiet about it you kind of wonder, ""they seem happier with their women don't they?"" It's slightly manipulative as well since the cinematography during their passionate love trips are beautifully shot with mountain ranges while their normal homes have drabby looking houses, crying kids and depressed looking wives. It's no wonder we want to root for the men don't we?I will give the film props though: it is a love story and it's handled nicely if one sided and the actors are more than willing to show it. It might seem like I'm using more from the con list but it does have great cinematography, a relaxing(if extremely repetitive) score which I have no idea why it won the Oscar. The story between the women could've been handled better though. Michelle Williams literally drops out at one point in the story and the direction on Anne Hathaway during her last scene makes the ambigious ending even moreso.Expect a double dip, this one is guaranteed. Obviously wanting to capitalize on the Oscar attention, the film comes with a very barebones disc, coming up with no more than 4 featurettes. No commentary? Deleted scenes? Coincidentally, Crash which got the upset Best Picture win over this film is released on the same day with a bigger release. Trying to steal thunder, methinks? It's a solid story and while it is a good film, I can see why it lost, although personally, Crash is no better."	4.0	A great love story or overhyped liberalism?	2006-04-06	19	9	10

I did not go into this film, having now seen it first on DVD thinking it was a movie about gay sexual relationships by two cowboys. I viewed it looking for passion in character and culture in the cowboy lifestyle. I found neither. Heath Ledger looked disinterested...lack of dialogue, lack of fire and lack of character development. The focus of his love, Jake Gyllenhaal just did not fulfill the cowboy look to me. He was too city strung and at times even reminded me of Billy Crystal in ""City Slickers."" There was not enough movement in the storyline for me to feel sorry for either one of them and as I said, I don't view movies with a bias going in.The tragedy in the end with Jack's slaying seemed like the senseless and silly ending that Nicholas Evans gave Robert Redford's movie character Tom Booker in his book version of ""The Horse Whisperer."" In the book, the horse Pilgrim rears up and crashes down on Booker, killing him instantly simply because the horse hated him. Redford left that silly notion out of the movie and instead made a real love story that captured the life of a western rancher falling in love with a married city executive. Brokeback killed off Jack in a stereotypical fashion symbolic of the killing of the gay student in Wyoming several years ago...because of the prejudice part of our society has towards gays. Too easy an ending to create sympathy and a convenient ending of sadness. The link of course was to Jack's flashback of the man earlier in his life who was killed in much the same way. I would have been more satisfied had Jack and Ennis just realized they could not meet anymore because of the dangers of such love at the time.To the myriad of reviewers who have applauded the film, I respect your admiration. It is a beautifully shot film and captures scenery of the west magically. But I just can't raise more than a star for this one.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A21G1MUAP3JUDX	"Coltbear - A Music Fan ""DJ Steve"""	"Everyone is reviewing the movie - it's incredibly hard NOT to, but having bought an advance copy of the DVD today (legal), AND having seen the movie, I'm glad to say the DVD transfer is gorgeous - they did it right.  Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is breathtaking and spectacular, while at the same time being almost Zen-like in its unhurried beauty and tranquility.  ""Brokeback Mountain"" is destined to be among ""Dances With Wolves,"" ""The English Patient,"" ""Out Of Africa,"" ""At Play In The Fields Of The Lord"" and other sweeping, epic visual classics.  This film deserves to be watched on as BIG a screen as possible for its sheer, scenic beauty alone. I haven't seen ""The Memoirs Of A Geisha,"" (which won the Oscar for Cinematography), but they should have declared it a tie.  I was a little disappointed to discover that the film was shot at some of the highest points in Calgary, Alberta (Canada) - couldn't director Ang Lee find the same majestic beauty here in the good ol' U.S.A.?  And, if Universal Studios is listening, though the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is excellent, DTS sound on this DVD would have been outstanding.  I'm sure the out-takes would have been a lot of fun to see as well!  A few music videos (the score won an Oscar), could have been included.  Maybe all of these and more in the ""Special 2-DVD Collector's Edition?""Since we're in Oscar territory, having seen both ""Capote"" and ""Brokeback Mountain,"" while Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance was undeniably brilliant, (IMHO), Heath Ledger deserved to win Best Actor for his remarkable, INCREDIBLY understated and restrained portayal of Ennis Del Mar (still, all the while ticking underneath like an emotional time-bomb.)  Larry McMurtry (co-writer of the screenplay), wrote to Ang Lee and mentioned (between actual cowboys), ""how important the non-verbal communication was just as important as what is spoken.""  Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal GOT that completely - and they DIDN'T learn it from ""Cowboy Boot Camp,"" where they both actually went to prepare for their roles.  Their commitment was bringing the script to life (and the love between their characters contained within), as often what is NOT spoken between them means as much as what IS - for example, the tender way Ennis embraces Jack from behind by the fire, quietly telling him, ""You're going to fall asleep like a horse standing up,"" then gently rocking and humming to him.  Scenes like that are repeatedly and each time beautifully conveyed not only by them, but by ALL of the outstanding actors.  Michelle Williams as Alma (Ennis' wife), deserves special mention - a superb ""quiet storm"" throughout, the look on her face when Ennis is about to ""go fishing"" with Jack the first time is worth a thousand words.  When he closes the door to leave, you can see AND feel all of her hurt and pain as her world (and the man she thought she knew), is literally turned upside-down.Next, on a lighter note, let me put to rest the answer to a burning question on MANY people's minds, ""Was that Jake and Heath jumping off the cliff (naked?)""  Upon careful frame-by-frame inspection, the answer is no, they were BOTH doubles.  (That's okay.  Some things are better left to the imagination!)  :-)In the DVD extras, it was very interesting to discover that screenplay co-writers Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry were trying to get this film made for years (since the debut of the short story in 1997), ""but no one would touch it."" (It was known as ""The Greatest Unproduceable Screenplay Ever Written."")  Focus Films producer James Schamus also said (when he was an independent producer), ""I wanted to produce this film for years, but the world wasn't ready for it.""  And how Diana and Larry used virtually EVERY sentence in Annie Proulx's thirty page short story of ""Brokeback Mountain"" in their screenplay, then ""fleshed out the characters' lives,"" to bring it to fifty pages - and then had to ""make up the rest,"" as they needed twice as much for the movie (and the flawless job they did winning them a well-deserved Oscar.)  What was most touching though, was what they said upon its release: ""We are stewards of the story.  It's like raising a child, you hope the child is accepted and successful, and you send it out into the world and it ceases to be yours.  It becomes everyone's story.""The DVD interviews show it was so very obvious how EVERYONE involved in this film TRULY viewed it as a labor of love, and what drew everyone to it was the honesty of the characters in the script that made every perfectly cast actor want to bring their role to life (so brilliantly, I might add - after seeing it, you can't imagine ANYONE being anyone else but who they ARE in the movie!)  As Heath Ledger said, ""I always like to try and bare my soul a little bit.""  Jake Gyllenhaal added, ""I'm always looking for films that go after an emotional journey.""  When Ennis DOES bare his soul - when Jack leaves him at the end of their first season on Brokeback, and he doesn't expect the rush of feeling of emptiness he feels; when Jack tells him, ""I wish I knew how to quit you, Ennis Del Mar,"" and Ennis tells him to ""go ahead and LEAVE me alone,"" then completely and totally breaks down, emotionally and physically, because that's the LAST thing he wants Jack to do; when he visits Jack's room, then discovers how much and how deeply Jack always loved him (and in its symbolism, always wanted to protect and take care of him), to name only a few, are nothing short of completely DEVASTATING, and in these moments YOU are experiencing the same ""emotional journey"" Jake Gyllenhaal so accurately described without even THINKING about it.  To become so enamoured with these characters (their lives and their surroundings), that you didn't even know you were being seduced - therein lies the real beauty of ""Brokeback Mountain"" - and a testament to the labor of love from everyone who brought it from thirty pages to the screen.In this epic, all-American love story that knows no preferences, boundaries or gender (only that of love itself), everyone can take that ""emotional journey"" that Jake and everyone succeeded in making with this timeless, outstanding film and DVD release. Not only will Heath Ledger (who tragically left us all too soon in 2008), be remembered for an Oscar-worthy performance and one that will always remain a legacy of his, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is destined and deserves to become an American classic and legacy that thankfully, the world finally seems ready for."	5.0	A Great, Epic, All-American Love Story  - (DVD Review)	2006-03-22	62	50	12

I cannot imagine how anyone but the most hard-hearted and bigoted of viewers could fail to see that the lovers portrayed in Brokeback Mountain are not different from us--whether we be gay or straight, male or female, rural or urban, we are all capable of loving the same way. Their tragedy is simply that society was and is incapable of accepting them.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A39AWL2FKWDFK6	Cory D. Slipman	"Ang Lee's slightly overhyped ""Brokeback Mountain"" was a decent story about a relationship forged between two Wyoming cowboys played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal who were to become lifelong soulmates.  The film benefited from Hollywoods perchant for heralding particular themes when selecting films for awards.  This years theme of alternative lifestyles elevated the film's status.  No question the film was cinematographically stunning with its gorgeous western panoramic vistas and desolate Wyoming towns.  The relationship between the men was poignant yet the film dragged at points.Their tabooed relationship was in stark contrast to the social mores present in the 60's and 70's in the remote West.  Ledger in particular was very effective as the taciturn Ennis Del Mar who finds love with Gyllenhaal playing Jack Twist as they work a summertime job of sheepherding on Brokeback Mountain.  Both men go on to marry and have children existing in largely unfulfilling relationships.  After a hiatus of four years they reconnect are able to find chunks of time where they go off together.The stories chronicles the evolution of their relationship over an approximately 15-20 year period of time that culminates unfortunately in tragedy.Ang Lee did a nice job in his direction and hefty Randy Quaid did well in his portrayal of the sheepherding boss Joe Aguirre."	4.0	An unconventional love story	2006-04-01	26	13	13

I have seen it 12 times and the last night it played I saw it back to back I wish it would stay on the big screen forever because the DVD on TV will not give the wide scope the background that helps in creating the whole story. My message to people who are turned off by two men in love is to ignore the sex of the characters and Listen To The Story. The STORY can affect everyone differently and I wish they would see it for the story line. I lost control one night after seeing it. When I got home I fell apart and could not even stand up. It can be a very emotional film and is a very emotional film. Especially those who grew up in that era. I was 2 years younger than Ennis and Jack so it hits home.

That too was a wonderful piece of work and I don't think there could be anything musically adds to enhance the film. Thank you to all who worked so hard to make this wonderful film. To me it's up there with ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Titanic"" as some of our greatest movies made.AUGUST 5, 2006I WENT TO SEE THIS MAJESTIC MOVIE 12 TIMES AND I CRIED EVERY TIME. THE ASTORY DOES NOT HAVE TO BE ABOOUT TOW MEN OR TWO VOMEN OR AMAN AND A WOMAN. IT IS ASLOVE STORY BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE THAT IS STALLED AND DOMED TO FAILURE BECAUSE ON CANNOT MAKE A COMMITMENT TO THE OTHER.HEATH LEDGER DID A MARVILOUS JOB AS ENNIS DEL MAR. HE HAD TO CREAT A ROLL OF A FICTIONAK PERSON AND HAD TO RELY ON LOOKING FOR RESORCES TO LEARS HOW TO TALK, WALK, MOTE AND RECACT TO THE OTHER ACTORS  ' LINES. HEATH DID SUCH A GREAT JOB BY THE TIME THE MOVIE WAS ABOUT HALF WAY OR LESS HE WAS ENNIS EDL MAR. THERE WS NO HEATH LEFT. HE TOOK ALL OF HIS ENERGY AND DUG DOWN INTO HIS SOUL AND ACTUALLY CREATED ENNIS DEL MAR. THE BECAME THE REAL PERSON, JUST BY THAT PART OF ACTING HE DESERVED THE OSCAR, THIS MOVIE IS TOO MUCH FOR ME TO WATCH. SINCE IT LEFT THE THEATER I HAVE WATCHED IT TWICE AND TOTALLY BROKE DOWN AND CRIED, IT'S TO POWERFUL AND EMOTIONAL. I LOVE IT!AUGUST 6,2006I LOVE AND ADORE THIS MOVIE AND IT SHOULD HAVE WON ALL THE OSCARS IT WAS NOMINATED FOR, AND IN MY HEART IT HAS. HEATH DID AN EXCELLENT JOB IN CREATING ENNIS DEL MAR. HE HAD TO CREATE THIS CHARACTER FROM A SHORT STORY AND FLESH IT OUT TO A 2+HOUR MOVIE. HE HAD TO CREATE A FICTIONAL CHARACTER AND REACHED DEEP DOWN INTO HIS INNER SELF AND PULL THIS CHARACTER TO THE SURFACE. I LOVE THIS MOVIE AN IT WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE. I HOPE SOME DAY I'LL BE ABLE TO WATCH IT AGAIN, WITH OUT HAVING AN EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN. I CRIED EVERY TIME AT THE THEATER AND THE 2 TIMES AT HOME. I HAVE NOT WATCHED IT SINCE THEN. IT IS TO EMOTIONAL FOR ME TO HANDLE, IT HITS TOO CLOSE TO HOME FOR ME.I WAS ENNIS DEL MAR, FOR 15 YEARS WAS MARRIED,THEN DIVORCED BUT I FOUND MY TRUE LOVE, IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME PERIOD.I FELT THE SAME WAY HE DID AND HAD THE SAME NEEDS HE DID. SO I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO BE GAY IN THIS COUNTRY, A COUNTRY THAT PROMISES FREEDOM AND LIBERITY FOR ALL.AT LEAST I HAD MY LOVE FOR 11 YEARS , HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR 20 YEARS. HE WAS AND WILL BE MY ONLY TRUE LOVE. AT LEAST I GOT SOMETHING ENNIS WANTED AND REALIZED TOO LATE JACK WAS HIS TRUE LOVE.

I also thought that Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway did great jobs playing their wives-the only thing I have to say is that Anne Hathaway's hair looked very strange toward the later part of the film.Lots of people might make fun of the movie, saying that it is immoral to portray two men in love, but it is a sweet simple story and watching two hot guys making out in a movie is pretty interesting.	5.0	A Love Story like no Other	2006-04-27	40	30	10

The adaptation of the story to a screenplay was genius, and the film was as beautiful as it was depressing.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1V44WCLV1CVIV	C. RAMOS	Many beautiful nature shots can't redeem this dull and overly long flick. There is no real chemistry between the two main characters. The one sex scene is dark, frantic, and anti-erotic. Other than for some rough housing, there is little to make one think these guys are attracted to one another. Too much time is spent on their separate lives. It would have been interesting to get a glimpse of their inner lives, perhaps their fantasies, given they were so adamant about getting together at Brokeback Mountain every year while they were married to women. This director clearly knows nothing about what attracts one person to another.	2.0	Gay Love Minus the Eroticism	2008-02-29	23	5	18

Usually they are very flashy and the men or women in the films are either very butchy or very feminine (men)it was not about the physical (how it currently is) it was about the emotional torment they went through.. (let me say my review is not to offend anyone)the reason I bring this up is because the movie is based on how it USED to be in the old days when homosexuality was not accepted so seeing them love each other so much regardless of the lives they were supposed to be living.

Much was made about it being the first mainstream movie about gay cowboys but it was also an achievement for Lee that he was able to bounce back from the commercial and critical disappointment that was Hulk.Heath Ledger has gone from teen comedies like 10 Things I Hate About You to such diverse roles as the ones in Lords of Dogtown and The Brothers Grimm. This performance may be his finest yet. It is a very internalized one. Ennis doesn't communicate very much verbally but rather through physical gestures and by his eyes. It also doesn't hurt that Ledger has the rugged good looks that are ideal for this role.Jake Gyllenhaal turns in yet another excellent performance as a hopeless romantic stuck in a marriage with someone he doesn't truly love. One gets the feeling that the time away from Ennis affects him the most but it is only because it is visible in the way he acts and in his eyes. He's the one who pushes hardest from the two of them to discard their traditional lives and be together all the time. However, as the film progresses, we begin to realize that their time apart hurts Ennis just as much - he just keeps it bottled up inside.There is a touching intimacy to Jack and Ennis' relationship. It isn't just physical, it is also about companionship. When you spend that amount of time with someone you get to know them really well. It is the kind of relationship that changes the course of their lives. Ultimately, Brokeback Mountain is a tragic love story - even more so because we get to know Jack and Ennis so well. We become emotionally invested in their lives and we know that they can never be together in the way that they would like. Ang Lee's film is one of those rare ones that actually does live up to its hype and definitely worth a look.""On Being a Cowboy"" takes a look at the cowboy camp that the actors went through so that they could get an idea of what that kind of life was like and portray it convincingly on camera. Ledger actually grew up on a farm and had plenty of experience riding horses.""Directing from the Heart: Ang Lee"" is a love fest for the director. The cast praise his direction and talk about how much they admire him.""From Script to Screen: Interviews with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana"" features the two screenwriters talking about their first reaction to Annie Proulx's short story that first appeared in the pages of The New Yorker.Finally, there is ""Sharing the Story: The Making of Brokeback Mountain"" that originally aired on the Logo channel. It follows your typical making of featurette that mixes interview soundbites with clips from the movie. This is a nice if not superficial look at the movie."	5.0	A tragic love story...	2006-04-03	16	14	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ACXLSZPQ9CBEV	C. Woodhouse	I had mixed expectations about this movie. It sounded like an Oscar vehicle with an overly GLAAD oriented story line. When I heard Ang Lee was directing however I was compelled to see it.The movie is from start to finish a through and through work of art.It's touching without being heart-stringy, presenting believable, well developed human characters in realistic situations. It's well paced, allowing situations to evolve organically without lingering too long or jumping away too quickly.In terms of acting I was most surprised. Before this movie I would tell anyone that I hated both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal (especially Bubble Boy), but they were too believable in this movie. Their performances were good enough to make me, probably their biggest detractor, praise them for Oscar worthy jobs.Without gushing too much more, the movie is (like all Ang Lee movies) a technical masterpiece, with beautiful stark cinemaphotography, fluid editing and exceptional use of sound.

EVERY 'cowboy' in college had Skoal marks or holes in their jeans.Gyllenhall, while a likable guy, acts like a city guy acting like a cowboy.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A28WJUJF6D2ULA	Dai-keag-ity	"I liked exactly two things about this, the single most over-rated motion picture to come down the pike since....I can't remember when. The first thing I liked was the beauty of the natural setting at the start of the movie when the couple at the heart of this story, Jack and Ennis, were atop Brokeback Mountain itself. The other was during the fireworks scene when Heath Ledger's character punched out the rude biker type who was cussing and being crude around his little girls. The rest of the film...well...I realize this is one of those stories where if you don't like it, you're instantly and with a closed-mind convicted of being a homophobe (such a convenient passive-aggressive term!) or unenlightened, or the ever-pat, ""you just didn't get it.""  I disagree. I'd like to think I'm at least as enlightened as the next person out there and if I'm accused to failing to ""get"" Brokeback Mountain, then I'll turn the tables and say maybe a large portion of the audience was too ready to excuse too much here and proclaim its greatness for reasons other than its onscreen merits. Namely: ""Hey, look at how cool I am, embracing this movie about homosexuality!""I suspect many hailed Brokeback Mountain as masterpiece because they felt its subject matter was somehow artsy, ground-breaking, and morally sophisticated. I'll leave those evaluations to others. All I know is I saw it from a neutral perspective and I did not like this film. I expected I'd at least come away seeing some sort of quality to it, but even that is largely lacking. Michelle Williams, who gave seven seasons worth of fine performances on Dawson's Creek was such a washed-out weakling here, it was almost unrecognizable that she possesses the acting talents she does. I realize both the lead actors are in reality heterosexual men, but even so, for supposedly portraying two souls deeply in love, I discerned no chemistry at all between them, only a coldness that made it clear they were just two actors playing parts: disbelief was not suspended, reality intruded into the plot. If anything, a good subtitle for these guys might've been ""dumb and dumber"". Kissing like they did in public, in plain sight of one of their wives, in town, and their boss up on Brokeback Mountain? And yet thinking they were keeping some sort of secret for twenty-whatever years? Am I alone in seeing that as...stupid?What really put me off was not the relationship between the men, adulterous though it was, it was the fact these supposedly sympathetic figures were complete and total jerks. Obviously they were miserable and wished to impose that misery on anyone close to them. They were terrible fathers, especially Ennis, who constantly and cruelly let his longsuffering daughter down, rotten (and unfaithful) husbands, and not even very good friends and lovers to one another. How anyone felt anything but alienation radiating from these two defies explanation. If this is the movie that was meant to be a groundbreaking ambassador for the gay community, I think gays are in trouble, because far from advancing the cause of that segment, surely this is a closet-embracing backset."	2.0	The Emperor Ain't Wearing Clothes, Folks	2006-09-06	122	39	83

Great scenes of the countryside I cannot deny.  Overall it just didn't live up to the hype.  Not since Titanic was something thrown about the world in the biggest Dog and Pony show since Titanic.  And, like titanic, it's just a story, and it isn't all that.  Hathaway is horrible as an actress.  Ledger and Gylenhall are great actors who could have picked something better to play with.  Overall sorry, it was okay, but not the all american, all world, all encompassing film of the 21st century like it was billed as.  What to expect from hollywood though?  They make one final push with the ""pro"" alternative lifestyle approach and still botch it up.  What I mean is, they tried going in the opposite direction to balance the scales after they tipped over from the ""we're always happy nothing wrong here"" scenario that came from shows like Will and Grace and got shoved out into the mainstream by the likes of Ellen Degeneres and Rosie O'donnell."	2.0	I can quit you...I'll read the novel instead.	2006-04-10	98	21	77

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	This film stands tall as one of the best love stories ever written, filmed and acted in a long time.  The acting on all fronts is spot on and thats important in a film of this magnitude.  From Ennis and Jacks lovetorn relationship to Alma and her broken spirit upon realizing her husbands ways you are drug down into their lives, into their hearts and then shattered upon impact.  When watching this film you can't help but see yourself, see who you are on the inside.  No, this may not mean you see yourself as a homosexual man living a lie, but you can see the true intentions of the heart, you can see your life through eyes yet unseen.  I guess the best way to put it is this.  As has been said by many a critic, this film is a universal love story.  Yes I agree that it is mainly about the gay community and their stiving towards acceptance, but it really is so much more than that.  This film is not about a man loving a man or a man loving a woman but more a film about a man loving...plain and simple.  It's not about who he loves or how he loves but it's about him being able to really love someone.  Jack and Ennis found what one can rarely find these days, a love that transends time and rules and boundrys and even death.  These two men really were in love.  The brilliance here is in the depth of each charactor.  Ennis (played brilliantly by Heath Ledger) is reserved and cautious, afraid of his feelings, afraid of his heart because his heart is not something accepted by the world he lives in.  Jack (Gyllenhall) is the opposite, ready and willing to give himself, devote himself to Ennis at all costs.  To me, the star of this film is Jake Gyllenhall who gave a powerhouse performance and really proved to be the emotional core of the film.  He was a man lost in the times, lost in the way things were even though he just wanted to be loved by the one person he truly loved.  Is that a crime?  I can appreciate this film and appreciate the story it relates because I think every one of us has felt one way, anyway, that wasn't accepted by others, that was looked down on by others and yet maybe we weren't strong enough to keep pushing through.  Maybe we buckled under and gave into what other expected of us.  This is a beautiful story of two men who needed to be loved and needed to be accepted.  They found love and they found acceptance but it came with a price...but as the film, to me at least, shows so well is that that price is worth it's weight in gold if it means being happy.  These men never got to enjoy that bennifit because they never took hold of what they had.  They allowed society and what society thought to break apart what they could have had.  Ennis, more so than Jack, allowed his own fear to clowd out his heart and that drove him away from Jack, not because he didn't love him (just watch his heartwrenching scene after he walks away from Jack...as he crouches down in the ally)...no, he loved Jack but he was afraid of what man would do to him, what society would do to him, and I feel that he loved his wife, he loved her and didn't want to hurt her.  He knew being with her was the politically correct thing to do even though the lie of a life he was leading was killing them both.  Let that be a lesson to all of us.  If we know how to be happy, screw what anyone else thinks or says...do that thing that completes you...be happy because a life lived alone inside is the worst life to live.*I do want to point out that the exclution of Anne Hathaway in every award cerimony is a bit harsh.  She turned out a steller performance that I feel was overlooked because of all the attention Miss Williams is receiving...Anne would have been a welcome replacement for McDormand or Kenear at this years Oscars.

Ennis can't love Jack openly because of the man his father showed him when he was a boy who was murdered because he was gay, but who's to say that that man wouldn't have said that however much time he had with his lover wasn't worth any price?

But as a film itself, it's a wonderfully simple, plaintive accomplishment.I didn't have a problem understanding Heath's mumbled ""ennis"" accent. It's an all-too familiar tone from uptight men who can't  open their hearts.The massive hype and hoopla of this film having settled down, perhaps the viewing public will someday see the other hundreds of films with gay characters; granted, not all better, but more uplifting, and not so predictably tragic.A nice film, based on a great short story. But when ever gay actors will be able to do as much, that'd be nice.Can you imagine white actors playing African-Americans who suffer oppression?

Being an Aussie, I am soooo proud of how far our little Heath has come!!  Not only him, but the whole cast did a really respectable job.  I've always loved Michelle Williams (I was a big Dawson's fan), and even though she really wasn't in the film that much, she did an amazing job when she was.  The casting of Heath and Jake was just perfect.  I really recommend you all see it.	5.0	Such a beautiful movie	2006-04-23	36	25	11
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3DGVB3T5QJNRE	Danny G.	I'm glad to have lived long enough to see a movie of such pure greatness! Mark my words, this film will go down as one of the top films of the 21st century!Imagine! A love story between two men that will probably sweep the Academy Awards in one of the most homophobic countries in the Western World! Gay people have more civil liberties in Greenland than they do in the vast majority of the United States! How ironic!I have had the good fortune to have seen a few extremely wonderful gay themed movies, like Common Ground, starring Ed Asner. But Brokeback Mountain transcends sexual orientation and all other classifications we like to lump people into! It's about ultimate erotic love, mutually shared, between two adults. Something many of us will never truly experience in our entire lives. This brilliant story is a wake-up call to all of us, Gay, Bi-sexual, Straight, or any combination thereof. Life is too short, nothing, absolutely nothing, is more important than experiencing this kind of passionate, loving relationship shown in this mind boggling movie!I thank the author, screenwriters, producer, director and the actors for all sharing their genius, passion and greatness with the rest of us! You have changed my life forever!	5.0	Folks Will Be Watching This Film A 100 Years From Now!	2006-01-18	14	12	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2HII4U9WQ0XUV	"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep"""	"Stop me if you've heard this one before: two gay cowboys and a sheep walk into a bar in Wyoming. The one cowboy asks the bartender, ""say, do you serve sheep in this bar?"" And the bartender says: ""Naaahhh, pardner, but we do make some mean Buffalo Wings!""Ba-dump-bump.Anyway, Ang Lee bellies up to a different kind of bar with ""Brokeback Mountain"", a tale of the Love that Dare Not Speak its Name in 1963 Wyoming, where the men were---umm, well, fairly manly---and the sheep were pretty damned nervous.It's all about Jack and Ennis, two sheep-herds who venture out on the Lone Prair-EE and end up driving a lot more than a herd of sheep across the plains.""Brokeback"" is just not all that: this movie is Lonnnnng. Dear Jesus, they don't even tell you it's nearly eight hours without a potty break, and yeah, it packs its tale of anguish, terror, and white-hot bull-riding over the course of 30 years or so, but in the end you'll feel like you've been hanging with these two Tumbling Tumbleweeds for a hundred years, old hoss.Now: it's amazing that Ang has been able to package up a sliver of Flyover America and make it palatable even---especially!---to the Upper East side Manhattanite's super-chic & utterly sensitive sensibilities: hey, who doesn't like a movie about gay cowboys! Hell, these are the kinds of Blue Staters *we* can dig---you could even, Hell, take these cowpokes---woops, sheep-pokes---to a Broadway show!But edgy and dark it's not. No, Love is not a ""Force of Nature"": it's the chemical and biological bilge that clouds the mind until the breeding is done, and then it's either race the pack of little vermin you spawned or pay child support until you're a poor old geezer eating catfood out of a tin.Or not: the real irony of ""Brokeback"", the real tragic cruelty, is that Jack and Ennis are doing nothing that hasn't been done throughout time, only Mother Nature has no use for them: they're not breeding, and so they've turned into an evolutionary Box Canyon, so to speak. Mother Nature is a real b*tch when it comes down to it: She turns her back on our boys, and the rest just plays out like a gunfight at the Not-O.K. Corral where everybody's packing black talon ammunition and the winner gets an acid bath.Dark and Edgy? Nah, it's just eyeball-rippingly slow and dull, a Lifetime movie with better cinematography.So what we're treated to during the 20 hours this movie takes to unwind is this: lots of strained, mooning looks and glances, a little splendor-in-the-tickle grass by the campfire, and about a century of agonizing over a little innocent putting-from-the-Rough. Sheesh.Acting? It's fine, if you think it's all that hard for two gay Hollywood actors who wear eyeliner and makeup for their roles to 'pretend' to be two gay Wyoming sheep-herders who wear eyeliner and maeup for their roles. Jake Gyllenhaal does his freakish thousand-yard-stare thing in this one, and does it well: he's definitely wearing the chaps in this relationship---by contrast, Heath Ledger is the Nancy, wearing that anxious ""but will you respect me in the morning"" look. The chicks (Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams) are just props.If Ang Lee had wanted ""Brokeback"" to be truly dangerous and edgy, he would have made a full-bore porn flick and let the MPAA slap the damned thing with an NC-17, and really pushed the sex in our faces: made it one sensuous, liquescent romp of riding and roping and driving those cattle across the plains! Don't gotta understand them, just drive and rope and brand them, Rawhide! Then he could have really marketed the WIDESCREEN version of the flick, for those looking for something really uncut, so to speak.Or at the least, he could have broken up the monotony with a raid by a war party of Apaches, or even had Jack do a little ""Crouching Tiger"" maneuver, chasing Ennis through the trees and prefacing their wild coupling with a little bamboo staff-fighting. That would have rocked, and I would have given this flick at least three stars.Alas, no dice: we just get a prettier version of ""Bridges of Madison County"", which Gylenhaal filling in for Clint and Heath wearing the prairie skirt. Our fathers got John Wayne battling Apaches and Commanches: our generation gets Heath and Jake bumping uglies on the Lone Prairie. Is it any wonder we're messed up?In the end, you'd be better off checking out ""Open Range"", which is basically the same story, only with a gunfight, a hanging, and a helluva lot more sublimation.JSG"	5.0	Oh I can't get a Long Little Doggy!	2006-04-22	6	3	3

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3UU9IIOLGONMM	Darth Wader	One thing is certain...anything that humanity knows is important, and must be changed for the better will be made into a movie. Hollywood give us directors, and writers who act through their soul, and deliver this soul to the audience. It is no wonder that movies like Brokeback Mountain will be nominated for Oscar and be given award. This movie is certainly a relieve from all the lack-of-content movies we always see (movies like The Transporter or Wedding Crasher). Unlike movies such as the Hotel Rwanda or Passion of the Christ, this movie does NOT rely on religious and propaganda brainwash. It is based purely on the soul, and skills of the producers, making this movie a route to humanity's best.	5.0	Brokeback Mountain	2006-06-30	33	27	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A27FR2C67JPDRS	Daryl B	Brokeback Mountain is one of those rare movies that addresses a controversial subject, managing to hit a nerve with mainstream America, opening discussion and hopefully opening minds.  And who would have thought that the romantic love story of the year would involve a couple of gay cowboys from the director of Sense and Sensibility and The Hulk?The story centers around two men, Ennis Del Mar, played skillfully by Heath Ledger and Jack Twist, played perfectly by Jake Gyllenhaal.  The two young men, both needing jobs for the summer, find work as sheep herders in the mountains of Wyoming.  During that summer of long days and cool nights, the two men forge a friendship.  One night while trying to endure the extreme cold, the two men stay in the same tent and as they, seemingly as surprised as the viewer, begin a sexual relationship, we see the genesis of a life long, yet secret love affair.Once their summer jobs are over, the two men move on with their lives, starting families but eventually they are drawn back to each other.  As often as possible, the two lovers find ways to spend time with each other but denying themselves the chance at a real relationship because of society's attitude toward homosexuality.This film is beautifully adapted from Ann Proulx's short story and is easily the best movie of 2005 (even though the Academy took the cowards route and gave the award to a lesser film).  Thankfully they awarded the award for Best Director to Ang Lee and gave the Oscar for Best Score to Gustavo Santaolalla for his hauntingly beautiful score---it also recieved the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay as well.  Michelle Williams was also brilliant as Alma,  Ennis' long suffering wife who realizes that her husband is in love with his best friend.  The cinematography was incredible as well, like moving paintings of the western landscape.This film is bound to become a classic and will continue to be talked about for years to come.  Love is love, straight or gay, and any film that makes us realize how import love is in our lives, is worth your attention.	5.0	Run for the Mountains!!!	2006-02-22	4	4	0
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AJRPOXVAQ4JW0	"Dave Clayton ""Wereaardvark"""	"According to a famous dictum of Henry David Thoreau, most men lead lives of quiet desperation. In the highly successful film Brokeback Mountain, based upon a short story by E. Annie Proulx, and directed by Ang Lee, the men who exemplify this proposition are a pair of cowboys who pursue a frustrated and frustrating affair over a period of several years. In 1963, while tending sheep in the Wyoming back country, two young men, Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) end up sharing a tent one cold but frenzied night, during which Ennis anally penetrates Jack. The two men's lives subsequently diverge and both marry.While Ennis' marriage unravels when his wife becomes aware of his attachment to his buddy, Jack moves to Texas and, after sleeping with the daughter of a wealthy businessman, marries her and gets a comfortable job working for daddy. Nevertheless, the two manage to continue their liaison until Jack demands that Ennis live with him. The latter refuses, relating a traumatic experience he had had as a child when an older man living with his friend was beaten to death. When Ennis some time later sends Jack a postcard, it comes back marked ""Deceased,"" and the movie suggests his lover may have been the victim of a similar act of violence.The performances by Ledger and Gyllenhal are the movie's strongest asset. Otherwise Brokeback Mountain is a far from exceptional film. Compositionally mediocre, Lee's production lacks visual imagination, alternating between kitschy panoramas of the great outdoors and dreary views of small towns, gaudy saloons, and the cluttered dwellings of Ennis and Jack. Where Lee's earlier film Eat Drink Man Woman (1994) had a vividly depicted setting in Taipei with sharply observed characters, this movie seems to be taking place on the other side of the moon. Ennis and Jack no doubt deserve a better fate, but so does the audience.The movie falls back upon one of the most durable if dubious myths of American culture: the redeeming power of nature. In the great outdoors nature itself sanctifies the union still unblessed today by the powers that be in the United States. But the tradition was always ambivalent: if the frontier, whether terrestrial or aquatic, tolerated certain kinds of otherwise taboo male relationships, it conveniently quarantined them at the same time. And a price always had to be paid whenever this transgression crossed the border back into civilization. Brokeback Mountain remains faithful to the tradition by killing off Jack and condemning Ennis to a life of celibacy.Brokeback Mountain is a gay cowboy movie, right? Not at all. The movie portrays a homosexual relationship, but it leaves the question of the sexuality of the two men up in the air. Although Jack is shown as a bisexual philanderer whose escapades may have caused his death, Ennis remains a sexually enigmatic Rock of Gibraltar right up to the final fade out. Jean Renoir said of Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, ""It's supposed to be about homosexuals, and you don't even see the boys kiss each other. What's that?"" In this movie, the cowboys do a good deal more than just kiss, but they never manage to put their desires into words. What's that?Many years ago, homosexuality was often euphemistically referred to as ""The love that dares not speak its name."" After 1969, the year of Stonewall, few people would have any longer used the phrase except with ironic contempt. But in an odd way Brokeback Mountain makes that clich&eacute; come literally true. Ennis and Jack are sympathetic characters, but in the way the film presents them, they come across as inarticulate clods. Throughout a long movie the two men directly address each other a handful times.It is only necessary to go back to the 1950s to grasp what is woefully absent from the film. Let us imagine that the movie could have been made at that time with a screenplay by Tennessee Williams and with Elia Kazan as director--a playwright who often depicted outsiders and a director with an incredible talent for transferring such figures to the screen. Without a doubt, the two men would have been pouring their hearts out to each other from reel one. Characters like Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront or Cal in East of Eden are hardly intellectuals, but they express themselves quite effectively--even eloquently at moments.This inarticulateness is quite coherent with the way the movie presents the course of love between the two. Their first encounter is simply wordless, without even being preceded by any of the locker room banter about sex common among straight males. When the two couple in the middle of the night, it is as if God had sent a plague down on them that they can only passively endure. Just to underline the point, the next day Ennis discovers a wolf has killed one of the sheep, an omen of the fate that awaits them. Here we are far away from the still quite realistic territory of Williams and Kazan and closer to celluloid Transylvania where characters become werewolves overnight after violating some taboo. Following the discovery of the dead sheep, I nearly expected Maria Ouspenskaya to show up as a gypsy fortuneteller and see a pentagram on Ennis' chest.Brokeback Mountain allots Ennis and Jack their moments of fleeting pleasure, letting them kiss and even romp about in the nude, but they end up paying for these moments many times over, just like any pair of adulterous lovers in the old days of the Production Code. By contrast, in From Here to Eternity (1951), James Jones introduces a secondary character, Bloom, an Army boxer who is Jewish and a closeted homosexual who blows out his brains in the barracks. Bloom reflects his own internalized hatred for homosexuals of the men around him, but he turns that reflection into an act of violent defiance, not passive submission to the status quo."	2.0	The Love That Dares Not Speak Its Name	2010-10-25	15	2	13

All of the people that are giving this movie 1 star ratings and bad reviews obviously have a problem with the subject matter of the film and are disgusting people. This movie is about what true love is and should be -- it is not based on gender, rules or any stereotypes that go along with gender/culture, but instead just two oridinary people who find themselves in deeply in love and can't deny the passion they have for each other. I can't stop thinking about this movie, it has been haunting me and has been keepin' me wondering... the ending has left me speechless even after watching it three times, and I plan to do it again and maybe again...	5.0	Heart-breaking, stunning, beautiful.	2009-09-27	16	15	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	"In 1963, two young men Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are searching for summer work.  They find this in Brokeback Mountain in a small Wyoming city.  What they find is much more than just summer work; rather, much more than what they expected.  After months of staying in the camp site hurdling sheep and other duties, they find love within one another.  Neither had examined their sexualities before arriving at Brokeback Mountain.  The end of the summer leaves them heartbroken due to the separation.  Ennis stays in Wyoming, marries a woman named Alma, and has two girls.  Jack moves to Texas, intenses his career as a cowboy, marries a woman named Lureen, and has a boy.  Five years later, Ennis and Jack reunite and discover that their love they shared remains.  However, society and the times prevent them from sharing the love as deep as their desires.  This relationship leads to romance and heartbreak.""Brokeback Mountain"", adapted from the short story of the same name by Annie Proulx, was beautifully crafted by its cast and crew.  It proceeded to receive nominations and win several major awards, including eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) leading to three wins (Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score).  Its emotional impact remains alive throughout the film.  They beautifully express the characters' pain and turmoil caused by a homophobic society.  This adaptation is one of the best screenplays written in many years.  Few other filmmakers have crafted a storyline that compiles twenty-five years of events within only two hours while sharing its story so deeply.  Its storyline placement and series of events proved highly difficult, yet succeeded in many ways.Many are quick to label ""Brokeback Mountain"" a gay film.  However, it is much more than that.  It is a story of love, secrets, loneliness, and struggle to express their true selves.  This is one of many qualities that make this film so groundbreaking.  Therefore, its viewers will quickly recall the characters Ennis and Jack and how much of an impact they made.  This is the first film with a romance of two people of the same sex as its primary subject line to receive such critical success.  Therefore, this will surely open doors for other filmmakers to continue pushing the envelope.This film could not have been so monumental through its emotional stance if it wasn't for the actors' hard work.  Three of its eight Oscar nominations were for acting: Best Actor (Heath Ledger), Best Supporting Actor (Jake Gyllenhaal), and Best Supporting Actress (Michelle Williams).  For years, Ledger and Gyllenhaal have been underrated talent-wise, despite several wonderful performances (Ledger's ""The Patriot"", ""Monster's Ball""; Gyllenhaal's ""The Good Girl"", ""Donnie Darko"").  Ledger's performance as Ennis, a quiet and lonely man, showcases his talents further than in the past.  Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack, an eccentric and and outgoing man, fits well with Ennis and the overall film.  Williams and Anne Hathaway successfully placed their teenage image aside for the film.  Williams proves that she is much more than just ""Dawson's Creek"" as the lonely and gentle Alma.  Hathaway proves that she is much more than just ""The Princess Diaries"" as the sassy and feisty Lureen.Such film quality proves that ""Brokeback Mountain"" will stand beyond the test of time.  Therefore, this is destined to become a classic.  Hopefully by that time, the government will have legalized same-sex marriage."	5.0	The True Best Picture of 2005	2006-05-23	30	26	4
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	I waited to see this film divorced from the hype on it's initial release.  Anybody reluctant to see this film can relax because it's not going to change your inclinations.  Is this a great film?  That's debatable but it is a very good one.  I was impressed with a few things about this film primarily the direction by Ang Lee.  He allows the story to develope deliberately.  He doesn't shy away from the provocative nature of Ennis and Jack's relationship but it is told with discretion and taste.  Another thing that impressed me was the towering performance by Heath Ledger as Ennis.  Ennis is a taciturn man who does not verbalize his emotions but allows them to burn inside.  This kind of role in the wrong hands could come off as one note but Ledger pulls it off brilliantly.  Jake Gyllenhall is fine as Jack but his performance pales in comparison to Ledger's.  Great supporting work is offered here by Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini and Randy Quaid.  Another bonus is the splendid cinematography and the touching score.	4.0	A Love That Can't Speak It's Name	2006-05-15	40	33	7

The film is brilliant.  The cinematography is breathtaking, and the acting couldn't have been better if it were a documentary.As for the first ""reviewer""  the film is about unrequited love, not something as simple as ""gay cowboys""  Something which by the way is entirely plausible.  Are you aware that eight percent of all sheep are gay? How about the fact that penguins will mate with members of the same sex? Just because gay people can not procreate does not mean it is not natural.

This movie is about the love affair between two cow boys Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist in 1963. After seeing this movie and I couldn't calm down my sorrow for awhile. We are kind of being spoiled of living in 2006 today, but I know some people who are still living in a closet like Ennis and Jack in the movie.After the movie, I have few questions to ask you:1)  How can you tell your husband is not gay? Or you are fooling your 100% straight husband right now on a same boat (lesbian)?2)  If you are a gay straight man (living in a closet with a family), would you continue to blind yourself and the others? But Why (Remind you that life is short!)3)  If gay is wrong and have to be suppressed, then how about love? Is love wrong and it has to be suppressed too? Who can approve two human beings can love or not love each other. Society, religious, government or ....If gay is a choice, do you choose to be straight? I think we all just have to listen to the heart carefully.At the end of the movie, I had a song came out in my head and it matched the ending of the movie very much.Here I am playing with those memories againAnd just when I thought time had set me freeThose thoughts of you keep taunting meHolding you, a feeling I never outgrewThough each and every part of me has triedOnly you can fill that space insideSo there's no sense pretendingMy heart it's not mendingChorus:Just when I thought I was over youJust when I thought I could stand on my ownOh baby those memories come crashing throughAnd I just can't go on without youOn my own I've tried to make the best of it aloneI've done everything I can to ease the painBut only you can stop the rainI just can't live without youI miss everything about youChorusIt's just no good without youWithout you, without you, without youAir Supply / Here I am	5.0	the story of brokeback mountain is everywhere	2006-02-06	24	7	17
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2Q42ON9CEHR4O	David R. Eastwood	"I found BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN a painfully sad experience--wonderfully filmed, as Ang Lee's movies usually are, and well acted, but deeply depressing. It was comparable to watching a slow-motion train wreck on an ironically beautiful, bright sunny day--or reading one of Thomas Hardy's later novels.Neither Ennis Del Mar nor Jack Twist (played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) was a character that most of us would admire or respect: both were like good-looking Lost Boys who never became responsible adults with the passage of time. Despite their differences in temperaments and experiences, they were like a pair of perpetual Peter Pans, poorly educated, pitifully below average intelligence, and morally irresponsible.Most would agree that our DNA and the vissitudes of life largely determine what handicaps or deficiencies our minds and bodies have, and these normally are factors that nobody ought to be blamed for. But our willpower (or ""won't-power""), especially when it involves honest interactions with others, is usually seen as an entirely different matter. Throughout the film, both Ennis and Jack lead dishonest lives that harm their spouses, their children, themselves, and each other. (BTW, if you think this is harsh, ask yourself how vigorously you would defend a so-called straight married person who is leading a lie-based double life with one or more lovers outside his/her marriage.)If Ennis and Jack had been presented as malicious men, they would not deserve our pity. Instead, they come across as pitifully weak, essentially careless and thoughtless ageing adolescents. We watch their deceitful, destructive behavior with sorrow, knowing that they are incapable of changing for the better--perhaps foolishly hoping their lives will improve somehow but expecting them to worsen.As far as courage and integrity are concerned, the one bright spot in the picture was when Jack Twist stood up to his domineering father-in-law (ably played by L. D. Newsome); sad to say, immediately he fell back into spinelessness and deceit. And the low point for Ennis was when he became violent with his ex-wife when she revealed that she knew he and Jack did not do any fishing on their fishing trips. Perhaps the most poignant scene is when Ennis asks his daughter, Alma Jr. (Kate Mara), if the man she's engaged to marry is in love with her, and she says that he is.The murder of Jack was skillfully foreshadowed and resonates, of course, with events that occur in many U.S. communities today. Sadly coping with this misfortune, Ennis, in the process of trying to fulfill Jack's wish that his ashes be taken to Brokeback Mountain, learns that his lover had been cheating on him with another man. At the end of the film, we can feel certain that he will never find happiness of any sort in the remainder of his own life.Early in his book WALDEN (1854), Thoreau comments, ""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats."" The film BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN almost seems designed to illustrate that grim view of humanity."	3.0	"TWO PETER PANS' ""QUIET DESPERATION"""	2006-04-30	48	10	38
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2JXAQ92WYPAAR	"David Schweizer ""Almawood"""	The movie has a lot going for it, as has been said , and said well, here and elsewhere. For myself, the movie was visually pleasing and refreshing in some ways, too, but I had some problems with what is by now esteemed a virtual classic. I am a middle-aged guy, been around, lived in several states (though not Wyoming), but I have never seen a man cry, not once in my life. In this movie the guys are always crying. They cry when they meet, they cry when they separate, they cry after they kiss, they cry after they fight. Is this believable? In the film, it is 1963 and gay or not, I just don't believe they would have gotten through life intact crying all the time. Somewhere along the way, some male figure would have put them straight on this. They seem to have gotten the message on the shame of their sexuality, is it credible that they could have survived crying their way through high school, through military service, and so on? They would have had to learn the hard way that crying would not be tolerated. This seems like a small point, but for me it is indicative of the overall anachronistic mode of the film, which looks and feels a lot like two 1980s Santa Monica gays time traveling back in the 1960s. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think they wouldn't have survived a junior high school gym class weeping and slobbering they way they do.	4.0	What More Is There To Say?	2007-07-05	29	1	28

""Latter Days,"" the Mormon-missionary-loves-the-player love story by director C. Jay Cox drew meager audiences across the country, and drew only a few dozen people the night we saw it. ""Brokeback,"" on the other hand, was a sold-out crowd in the theatre's largest auditorium, one of three screens that showed that film.And almost half of that audience was straight, unless those heterosexual couples were comprised of gay men with their fag hags. There wasn't a dry eye in the audience by the time the closing credits rolled.For those few of you that live under a rock, ""Brokeback Mountain,"" from ""Crouching Tiger"" director Ang Lee, is the story of two ranch hands who work the slopes of the titular mountain while herding sheep in 1963. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) are simple, relatively uneducated men who must cope with emerging feelings for each other. Their friendship leads to a cold night in a pup tent, which sparks a passionate romp during which the two men have sex.And no one walked out of the theatre. No one yelled, ""UGH!"" It struck at the very core of those of us who have had similar awkward positions of first love, whether same-sex or not. As uncomfortable as it might have been for the straight men in the audience, they got it too. These two men didn't know how to really express their love for each other. They couldn't kiss (I'll pay well to keep Curtis from telling the story of our first kiss in any detail).But then the movie progresses to detail the fact that it wasn't a ""one-shot deal,"" as Ennis wanted at first. The rest of the summer brought them closer and closer together. Their final parting was bitter, hard, and still awkward.  Of the two actors, Ledger rises far above the brilliant Gyllenhal, especially during a scene immediately after their scuffle in which Ennis must cope with the fact that he's truly in love, even if it's a forbidden love.The rest of the film is a montage of the lives of the two men over the next twenty years, and we're introduced to both of the characters' wives. The complexity of the script is illustrated when Alma, Ennis' wife stumbles on her husband kissing this strange man from Texas who's coming for a fishing visit.Now we know what fishing buddies really are, it seems. Strange how they never fish.""Brokeback"" is clearly Ledger's shining moment, and Gyllenal's performance has its own passion. The chemistry between the two men is real, and the beauty of the cinematography is stunning.""I wish I could quit you,"" Jack tells Ennis later in the story. The power of love that's displayed in ""Brokeback"" is beyond borders, greater than fear, and brilliant even until that final frame.Is it the ""gay cowboy movie,"" as some say? Not really. But it is a powerful love story as only Ang Lee could tell. In the end, ""Brokeback Mountain"" will bury itself into your heart as the force of nature it is. Don't miss it. We drove an hour to see it. I left the theatre in stunned silence as I realized that I was still spellbound by the time I got home.In the end, it's worth the time, the drive, and your ten bucks.

Seemingly slow at first, the film is gently and lovingly wrapping itself around your heart. Heath Ledger gives a perfomance that is so acutely aligned with the story, he opens up the real world of the sorrow that must be lived by two people who cannot be theirselves because of the restraints of our historical society. His posture, his tightness, the barely audible cry of his voice are the stuff of Brando, Dean, and Penn. That he never pushes anything on us is the miracle of allowing us to see - full heartedly - the real life of this sweet, decent, unfulfilled man. And, miraculously, we never get a sense that we could judge him harshly. Ledger brings us into Ennis' soul. (One particular moment of astonishingly good acting is when - without ever letting Ennis' shoulders come down, or his body to let free, Mr. Ledger laughs so sweetly; holding on to the forced into a corner body of Ennis, while showing us - heartbreakingly - the joy that lay so deeply beaten into this man. It is some of the best acting you will ever see). Jake Gillenhaal is the perfect gem of a character that, in other circumstances, would have made the perfect love partner for Ledger's Ennis. All heart and love just emminates from him when - especially in the beginning of the film - as we get to watch just how much he desirews real connection with Ennis. Michelle Williams - in what could have been a thankless role - gives a deeply felt truth to the events she witnesses that must have torn her inner self assunder. From her first discovery of their shared passion to her final disclosure to her husband, she makes real the genuine loss that she has lived with. (I was completely flumoxed as to why Crash won best picture; other than that it touches on a more real part of life in Los Angeles today. As a film, I found it lacking - more like a TV movie than a work of art. As we watched Crash, I kept saying before each scene; ""oh, now he'll pick up the wrong truck... Oh, now he'll treat the black people badly""; and, so obviously, ""now they'll show us what a nice guy he is""... (when dealing with his father). The movie was just always so obvious in what was coming next). With Brokeback Mountain, I found myself haunted by the sorrow of the life they had to lead for days after seeeing the film. That has not happened to me while watching a movie in decades. This is a must for all who believe that art is a reflection  of life; as it was for Ennis and Jack. This film beautifully, sweetly, and emotionally holds the mirror right up to nature (as it were). This is a movie for all people to see and feel. It is a genuine - heart on it's sleeve - romance; and we are due for that."	5.0	greatest love story since Out of Africa, & breathtakingly emotionally full	2006-04-06	51	43	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A9VD20X239FSR	"Dean Backus ""Hi! How are you today?"""	"""Brokeback Mountain"" is, of all things, not dissimilar to ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" or ""The Sixth Sense,"" in that it casts its spell so deliberately and carefully, you have to pay extra-special attention to it during the set-up.  Some will react with impatience, finding the opening scenes between two taciturn ranch hands meeting and not saying much to each other over a long summer herding sheep in the Wyoming mountains (actually filmed in Canada) too deliberate.  But when the dramatic moments come, they come like a prairie thunderbolt, and you realize with a shock how carefully Ang Lee and his brilliant cast (all sensational, but Ledger and Gyllenhall are iconic) have set up your expectations, have hooked you so throughly that you are hit as if it were a sucker punch.  The longing glances, the quiet moods, the mournful soundtrack, the pristine vistas all contrast with moments where the characters' passions explode--into love, into violence, into heartbreak.  Jack and Ennis' tragedy spills over into the lives of almost everyone they touch, due to societal pressures and the overwhelming suffocation of silent conformity; when, late in the picture, one realizes what his life has been come to and what has been lost, it's a 3-handkerchief moment.  Yes, there's about 1 minute of implied sex--much less explicit than your average PG-13 movie with a male-female couple--but it's the moments before and after the coupling that haunt you: Ledger getting the first kiss of his life, and finally realizing that someone truly loves him; Gyllenhall's amazing tenderness and strength as he tries to corrall a man who's even more resistant than the wild horses and bulls he futilely tries to tame.  Again, this is a movie that fits Ang Lee's oeuvre of charcters at war between their inner passions and desires and a community that encourages conformity and self-denial; it will make you work, and demand much from a filmgoer.  But after a cautiously positive reaction seeing it the first time, I found myself seeing it again and being overwhelmed by its emotional impact, to the point where I actually think/thought about the characters as real people.  Oscars or no, the 22+ organizations that named this the Best Film of 2005 weren't wrong: it wraps around you like a pair of strong arms encased in a warm flannel shirt, and doesn't let go.  This is a love story for the ages."	5.0	A heartbreaking tale of love denied	2006-03-23	67	57	10

I have waiting and soul searching long and hard to find the appopriate words to fit. I anticipated this movie with great enthusiasm as it was heralded as the next best thing since the wheel all over hollywood. When the reviews came in I was pushed even further in my reverie. Then came the nominations, and I was certain this was 'the one.' I was sadly incorrect in my assumption. This picture is well acted and the cinematography is breath taking. However, it is only a reminder that gay people never get a happy ending in hollywood and even has the nerve to go way beyond that. (Tip: If you have not seen this picture stop reading now as I will reveal the ending.) Ang Lee is a very creative director and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are both extremely good actors. Let me get that out of the way right now. There is a line in a movie called ""The Boys In The Band"" that states 'not all faggots get bumped off at the end of the story.' Unfortunately that is not the case here. Although this is my opinion, the money spent on this disaster could very well have been put to better use. There is no reason whatsoever the lead character has to be brutally murdered in such a violent fasion. Nor was there a reason the scene had to be so long and graphic! There is an entire generation of young people that left the theater or removed this DVD from their home systems thinking this was status quo. That gay people DO always get killed violently, or worse, deserve it. It saddens my heart to think that somewhere a teenager who does not know any better has begun to beleive it! I realize this picture is depicting an era of time where things like this actually did happen. We have, however, come a long way since then and opinions have changed dramatically. We are no longer categorized as sick twisted individuals who must come to a brutal violent ending. There was a simple fix to this: Jakes character could easily have moved to another state and the two men just not see each other anymore. Not in Hollywood dear. It seems the powers that be insisted on the murder, and that is what you are left with. What a tragedy. I lived through the violent years of being gay myself, and am very proud of the struggles and progress we have made. This picture has thrown the gay rights movement back thirty years. The reason I am writing this review is because many people beleive what they read or see or hear. It is with my sincerest hope that this may help someone realize.....it isn't always like it happens in plays or in this case a hollywood movie. There is more to life. I have since thrown out my DVD and the book for fear if I donate it to a library or sell it, it would do more harm than good. Perhaps someday Hollywood will get this right......It just wasn't with this one."	1.0	Breaking My Spirit Mountain	2008-09-20	32	6	26
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3UGTHG1B15VPK	Dean Lekas	"I avoided seeing this movie in the theater for a couple of reasons: First off I am tired of the current crop of pretty-boy actors who trade on their looks to mask a lack of talent. I had assumed that this movie, having Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in the leads, would be the same. Boy was I wrong! I was seriously impressed with both these actors; they deserved all the accolades they received. I hope that they will choose well in the future because these are talented actors who deserve good roles in good movies.The second reason was the constant, endless hype. Let's be honest: this was not ""a movie that had to be made"" nor was this ""a story that had to be told"". In point of fact this story already had been told, though not nearly as well, by ""Another Country"" and Merchant-Ivory's ""Maurice"". That being said, what this is is an extraordinarily GOOD movie.Unfortunately, there are so many groups with agendas regarding this movie; you would think it was 3 or 4 different movies just judging from what people say. This is not an allegory on ""Gay Marriage"" or the ""Gay Lifestyle"", or anything else, good or bad. This is simply an extremely well written, photographed and acted love story were the two lovers happen to be men.I'll skip over the story, which I'm sure everyone should know by now, and explain why, in my opinion; this is such a great movie:Firstly is the subtlety of the movie. There is nothing slapping you in the face, and you have to watch the movie several times to see all the little subplots. The dialog is extremely well written, and again, you have to pay close attention because you WILL miss things that will become important later in the movie. Secondly are the characters. I found it fascinating how the character of Enis is not particularly likeable, but is far and away the most sympathetic character. Conversely, the character of Jack is extremely likeable, but I didn't find him terribly sympathetic. Although I have to admit, that for me, Jacks ""likeability factor"" went down several notches in the last scene with Jack and Enis. I think what he said to him was extremely cruel. But, since it was obviously not calculated cruelty, you still end up liking him. Much has been made of the two female supporting actresses. I think they did a fine job, but they were secondary at best to the Jack and Enis characters and found neither of them likeable in the least.Finally what I've heard called the ""ewww factor"" (ewww two guys having sex, ewww two guys in love). Guys, I guarantee you'll have ""seen"" more the last time you were at the gym. The ""love scene"" was, in my opinion more of a rape scene for all that they both knew what they were doing, and was very tastefully done. If tastefully is the word, but I think you get my drift. Aside from that, as far as any overt affection between Enis and Jack goes, if you've ever given your best buddy a big ol' bear hug and maybe a peck on the cheek after a few beers, you're not gonna see anything that will shock you. And if you've never done that, bud you have issues and should NOT watch this movie!To sum up, this is a movie you have to make up your own mind about, but you really should watch. I found it a truly moving movie, beautifully photographed, extremely well written and with truly outstanding performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. But fair warning, as the last scene fades out, you're going to feel an overwhelming need to give someone you love a hug!"	5.0	Much MUCH better movie than I thought it would be!	2006-04-18	53	41	12

No matter what the gender, he detaches himself from those he loves. It isn't until the tragic lesson of the end of the film that Ennis realizes that he is emotionally destroying everyone around him.Ennis could be any man fearful of losing himself in the love of another: gay or straight.  He absorbs the love of others like an emotional vampire and then wrings the people who love him dry.  It is an amazingly artful depiction of a man completely divorced from--not devoid of--his emotions.Even his words are doled out drop by drop. Sparingly and rationed. He won't even raise his voice beyond a monotone so protective is he of their power. You get only so much and dare not ask for more.  It explodes the myth that the ""strong silent type"" is a desirable life partner.The film is a chronicle of the fallout from loving the emotional recluse that is Ennis Delmar."	4.0	BrokeBack Mountain	2006-05-16	16	10	6

I hope viewers don't try too hard to be impressed with this breakthrough movie just because of the unconventional storyline, because I think that's about all it has going for it.  The most sorrow for lost love I felt in this movie was when the wife of Ennis had to live with her unbearable knowledge for all those years because that's what women did back then, and the disregard he showed for his daughters amidst his own love for Jack.  That was the saddest part of the movie as far as I'm concerned. I can't be the only one who saw it this way, can I???	2.0	bucking the trend	2006-01-30	58	11	47

The characters get inside your skin, the haunting loss and yearning in the movie staying with you long, long after you've finished watching the film.I've heard fellow women comment on Jack and Ennis's cheating on their wives, but the point I make to them is that the film isn't about that element.  Well, it is to some degree in that it's a movie about the destruction that having to hide who you are can bring.  But the larger theme I take away from the infidelity is that it's just one more byproduct of what happens when you refuse to stand for something--anything in your life.  What Ennis chooses by allowing his life to go on, year after year, without making a choice to risk everything for love...he winds up making a default choice.Heath Ledger as Ennis DelMar is obviously brilliant, as has been pointed out many times over.  His bottled up rage and frustration, his subtle performance, always dancing on a razor's edge, gives an incendiary quality to the film.Gyllenhaal has been severely underrated, however, at least in this viewer's opinion.  Without his sunnier, inspiring hopefulness in the role of Jack, the movie would find itself almost too much to take.  It's the yin and yang of the actor's portrayals that makes vivid the yin and yang of the men's love for each other.A perfect, beautiful movie in every possible way.

Love speaks louder than words ...I'm a university professor and I tend to consider myself as a rather rational-intellectual and somewhat stoic person... but then came Brokeback Mountain which caught me off guard and has generated in me unforeseen emotion.Brokeback Mountain is at once the most lyrical, powerful, inspirational, yet heart-wrenching film in a long time, without doubt one of the most important and greatest films of the last few decades. This is truly an exceptional achievement, a landmark film with an amazing story/script, outstanding and exceptional acting, masterful direction, unhurried and controlled pace, breathtaking cinematography, simple yet excellent and beautiful music, and most importantly, unprecedented emotional impact. Its treatment of human nature, loneliness, longing for love, self-repression, intolerance, is done with admirable subtlety and sensitivity. This story is simply universal. Images of this film and stirring emotions will haunt you for days and weeks.  This is an extraordinary deeply moving film... simply unforgettable!Brokeback Mountain is a rare work of art in which silence speaks louder than words. Eyes and smiles can be very eloquent. Sometimes words are not necessary and are simply obstacles to the truest expression. Ennis's visit to Jack's room near the end of the film is a scene in total silence: he is alone and no word is uttered. Yet, this is surely one the most powerful and probably one of the most unforgettable scenes in recent cinematic history for its meaning and emotional impact... love speaks louder than words. Ang Lee realizes the full power of image in his exploration of the most intimate human emotions. Avoiding facile and superficial stereotypes, the great author Annie Proulx and director Ang Lee have created truer-than-life characters and, thanks of course to the unforgettable and heartbreaking performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Ennis and Jack"" now live forever, they are now undeniably part of the American literary and cinematic culture. How many other films have accomplished this in recent years?Brokeback Mountain will remain a milestone in cinematic history and is already considered a ""reference"". This film has been talked about all over the world and has attained unprecedented internationally acclaim - the ""Brokeback phenomenon"" has significantly crossed borders and, through the media and the Internet, has reached numerous foreign countries. Rarely did a film have such a strong impact on society, in the media, and with the general public. Brokeback Mountain has undeniably been the ""Most Acclaimed and Honoured Film"" of 2005 (and, as a matter of fact, of the last decade) and will of course be remembered as ""THE"" movie-event and most important film of 2005 despite the inexplicable absence of an Oscar for Best Picture to its already impressive crown.It's sad to say, but the recent disgraceful Oscar scandal proved how ""important"" and ""necessary"" this film is, and how many boundaries there are still to be conquered. After receiving dozens of prestigious awards worldwide, Brokeback Mountain might have been too subtle, too true, simply ""too good"", for the LA-based Academy... yes, the more I think of it, the feelings expressed in BBM are probably much too sincere and too profound for the Hollywood peanut gallery who often seems to prefer car crashes, car chases, explosions, fire, violence, rape, theft, gun shots, murders, etc. In any case, the newly released DVD of Brokeback will stand as a permanent reminder of how great this film is and how unimportant, irrelevant and meaningless the Oscars and the Academy really are.Countless people from all walks of life around the world will never forget Brokeback Mountain. This film is not pushing a specific moral, instead, it makes us think, it makes us feel, it makes us reflect on the true meaning and value of our lives.If you haven't seen this film yet, get the DVD, enjoy this truly exceptional masterpiece, and ""live the Brokeback Mountain experience""!"	5.0	Surely One of the Best Films in Recent Years!

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1FF2KROA1D87	Denise P	"I initially didn't like this film much since I expected an explicit romantic relationship between two gay men, from all the media hype.Instead I found a lack of a relationship due to denial, intolerance, fear and responsibility.I think I'm use to seeing more affection between two people in love as well.I'm afraid I dismissed the whole movie when it's just as creditable and praiseworthy as the Brandon Teena story in the film ""Boys don't cry"" without the numerous fatalities.To my surprise my earlier perhaps abrupt review gave some the impression I was an intolerant extremist with no empathy or understanding for anyone different then myself, when one of the reasons I like film is it offers inclusion into all areas of society.After many comments, misunderstanding and realization, a kind suggestion was made to view the film for a second time to see what it has to offer instead of what I want the film to be.  Since I would like to enjoy and appreciate every movie and feel privileged to read the heart felt comments I received from many individuals, I have gladly viewed the film again.What did I think?  GREAT film...................it's more a drama depicting remnants of a societal forbidden relationship.  There is definitely something for everyone in BBM.  Heath Ledger (as Ennis) and Jake Gyllenhaal (as Jack) are at the very least attractive and vulnerable, two of many elements common with falling in love.Ennis appears to be a quiet reserved hard working realist who wants the type of family he never had and is working toward it.  He seems to be an honorable man who keeps his word and cares about everyone in his life.Jack seems to be a playful, naive and sometimes reckless dreamer aware of his sexuality and wants to go off in the sunset somewhere and live happily ever after with a male partner during the films era of the 1960's.  He just wants to get on with it, living life to the fullest and the heck with what people may say.The two men meet in search of employment sheep herding.Jack is clearly interested in Ennis from first sight and shows off a bit in the only boyish way he knows.  The men work together and a close friendship is formed.  Then slowly and unplanned the bond they share is realized.Intellectually there are layers of emotions and unspoken words that both men are unable to communicate for fear of rejection, persecution, lack of understanding there own feelings, shame, etc.Once there work together ends the realization for Ennis that he may have strong feelings for this other man is powerfully, physically debilitating.  He is barely able to keep his quiet exterior and walk away.  Jack on the other hand seems use to unrequited love along with Ennis's earlier comment that ""this is a one time thing"", appears to handle the separation casually.Ennis proceeds with his prior commitment and gets married.Jack meets and then marries it seems in hope that this ethically acceptable relationship will work.  Neither man is evilly plotting to harm there spouses or future children.  They simply want to live and have some kind of life in this world.A few years later both men realize the passion they initially found hasn't gone away but appears to have become stronger.  The way anyone can feel they are a part of or the soul mate to another.Jacks wife seems to be so self absorbed she has no knowledge of her husband's preference until the end.  Apparently there is prejudice associated with the way a man leaves this earth.Ennis's wife is initially in denial feeling betrayed, then tries to verify her husband's sexuality.  Finally she pulls away from him completely, not understanding, and perhaps feeling shame and possibly disgrace attributed by society's judgments.  She does seem to struggle with loving a man who loves another man.The complexity and intricacy of each character, the acting of everyone in the film including the depicted societal constrains during that era is outstanding.  The cinematography throughout the film is commendable as well.And finally, not only did I find love between Jack and Ennis, but Jack and his son, Ennis and his daughters and even Ennis and his wife (although no longer romantic).I thank those that patiently wanted to understand my point of view in initially not liking the film and feverishly documenting there own views.Instead of my original review of 3 stars I'd rate this movie with 5 stars *****."	5.0	Where's the love, it's right here..............	2007-02-28	5	4	1

Denial, Hiding,Shame Wives to cover it up, etc.  Anyone who has heard this tale, goes knowing the twists and turns.Make the men cowboys for cultural iconic shock effect, a tool for marketing writers.Put them in a paradise, to help create a romantic mood.  Again, the story is told well, but if on top of that you use a paradise as the background, people are goingto root for Oscar.Probably not many people have heard about the lives of a gay couple in the 60's.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2OFSDJB3MVQ16	Dennis W. Wong	"I had no qualms about viewing this highly praised movie since I've seen in the past such films as ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" (directed by the gay director, John Scheslinger) and a highly rated Movie for TV ""That Certain Summer"" with Hal Holbrook as a divorced ""out of the closet"" gay man dealing with his young son's discovery about why his parents divorced. These films were both excellent and I looked forward to seeing this film but I was disappointed. Despite excellent acting from Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams, the film left me cold.  I think one of the reasons was that the film focused a little too much on the two male characters and less on the women.  My question too was did Anne Hathaway's character know that her husband was gay--and what were the consequences that resulted in their marriage.  Maybe director Ang Lee's approach is a little too detached for this material and also the writing had too many questions unanswered for me to fully enjoy this film.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1CMB89X3VBPYX	Derodicus	I just went to see the movie over the weekend and had heard all the hype about how wonderful it was.  I'll have to say that it did not live up to the hype.  The acting was great...very well done...but the story itself was EXTREMELY slow.  I found myself extremely bored at times and I don't know of a bigger no-no for a film than to bore the film goer.  Frankly I don't know that this film would have received this amount of attention or hype if it wasn't for the controversial subject matter.  If this were a heterosexual love story it would be another Notebook...average movie but not worthy of best picture.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2SYUDVK5Y3CQ	"D. French ""Lulu"""	"So many people that I know have stopped themselves from seeing this movie because of the hot-button issue it presents to its viewers.  But honestly, get over it.  This is such a beautifully done movie, from the transcription of the short story to the silver screen to the expansive shots. Such a little thing as the word ""gay"" should never stop anyone from seeing this.I'm a big fan of Heath Ledger's since A Knight's Tale, but I wasn't so much of a fan of Jake Gyllenhall's till I saw this.  Their acting is absolutely superb, and came completely from the heart.  They were each very expressive, and I didn't even feel as though I was watching a movie--I felt like I was right there with them, experiencing what they felt.It doesn't matter that they are both men.  It's love--we've all felt it before, in one way or another.  It's heartbreaking, it's wonderful, and it's impossible to live without, and this movie shows that rollercoaster ride perfectly.I enjoy watching westerns too, and I don't think that this destroyed any of the wonderful history that westerns have.  That's such a closed-minded way to think.  Rather, I think this movie paid homage to westerns and cowboys alike--I have a new respect for how tough real cowboys are, after seeing the work these two ranch hands had to accomplish for practically no pay!  This movie by no means tries to express that all cowboys are gay.All in all, this is a heart warming story that's wonderfully told and done.  I wanted to see what all the fuss was about after reading the short story--while I thought the story was good, I never thought it could be retold this well on the silver screen.  Honestly one of the best ""book-to-movie"" flicks I've ever seen.  Great casting, believable acting and breathtaking shots.  Don't miss this one.

Many obviously felt it too since the comment was deleted by Amazon. Apparently enough people reported him.Now there is a new comment saying that the characters and master director Ang Lee are mommie's boys, not real men. This obviously came from a simple minded man who believe that men are superior than women, and that men should become those alien creatures with no emotions we see everyday! Just because this film shows spirituality does not mean that these people are mommie's boys, and if they are, I think a world full of these people will be better than a world full of you!	5.0	Narrow Minded!	2006-06-04	36	27	9

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A16Z9F8V8ITZCH	Dinquinesh	"What I like best about this movie is that I can see the story played out thousands of times in real life. Our American society isn't as progressive as a lot of people may think. We may pat ourselves on the back, thinking we're glad ""those days"" are over, but be careful what we take credit for.Brokeback is ultimately about one person realizing that just because you love someone it doesn't mean you can be with that person. Life won't let you or maybe it's society, or maybe you're not allowing yourself. Regardless of the why, it's just not possible. And knowing you can't be with that person makes you miserable. But just because you're miserable doesn't mean you can go against something you know in your heart to be impossible. Love concurs all? No it doesn't. In 2006, it can still be dangerous to love someone of a different class or race or of the same gender.So why watch the movie? Because the story is excellent. Because it shows the debth of what love can be. Because this is real life. To me it represents the lives of people who for whatever reason haven't been able to be with the person they really want to be with in life. From an artistic standpoint, it really delivers. The actors are brillant. This movie is art, not about putting any kind of story together to sell tickets.I don't know how many of these nearly 800 reviews you'll read before you decide to watch the movie. But you're in for a real treat."	5.0	Real Life	2006-05-14	21	17	4
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1VEXHGQ24YIRV	Diversemusicfan	I saw this movie three months ago, and there is not a day that goes by where I do not think of this movie.  I am not gay, but the story touched me soooo much. Everything about this movie is perfect...the breathtaking cinematography, the touching,simple score that contrasts with the complex feelings of the characters, the brilliant acting, and the flawless script.  Two of the scenes, when Ennis talks to Lureen on the phone, and when Ennis visits Jack's parents, are about as close to film mastery as you can get.  What I love about this movie is that it is so so complex, the characters, including the wives, are so incredibly rich.  Ang Lee does an amazing job with every little detail, from the bit of red nail polish on Lureen's finger during that phone call to the speckled pot that Jack's mother uses, to the different color hats that the two characters wear-Jack wears a black hat and Ennis a white, showing their ying-yang connection- Lee has truly created a GEM of a movie. The biggest praise goes to Annie Proux, whose short story was lovely. I will say this however, I loved the movie even more the second time, I just noticed so many more things.  Anyway, to sum it all up, SEE THIS MOVIE, it has touched me in a way that few recent films have.I just can't seem to quit Brokeback Mountain!!:)	5.0	The Perfect Film	2006-04-06	45	39	6

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1BBAW36SSMIP2	DKBB	"Wow...this one was a gut-punch. Breathtakingly devastating... devastatingly breathtaking. Bored into my soul in a way no movie has in decades. It is such a harsh and sad story of love and dreams unfulfilled.  And really, there is nothing sadder than that...because at the end of it all, no one wants to have ""what if's"" in their life.While the love story is the at the core, what I got from BBM was the lesson of dreams denied.  When we deny or suppress our dreams and desires and just ""settle"" because we feel we must or we are made to, we wind up living a life that is less than complete...less than true.  And in so doing, the lives we touch and interact with like ripples in the water are not made fuller by our touch but are made less, are diminished by our touch, in a way. This movie has caused me to delve deep within myself and rediscover my dreams, and it has set me on a path to pursue those dreams and to become true. For that, I thank all involved with this wonderful, deeply touching story.The acting in this movie was gobsmackingly fantastic. I had never paid a whole lot of attention to either Jake Gyllenhaal or Heath Ledger before this, aside from noticing what cuties they were, and they both blew me away.  Heath Ledger WAS Ennis Del Mar - he crawled inside Annie Proulx's creation and wore him like a second skin...his performance was achingly wonderful.  Jake Gyllenhaal was the perfect balance of exuberance and dreamer...his portrayal of Jack's firm belief of the ability of his and Ennis' love to triumph if just given the chance was heartbreaking. Michelle Williams was spot-on...Alma's discovery of her husband's true love was realistically painful and difficult to watch. Anne Hathaway was the perfect Texas wife - I do think she was channeling a woman my family knew back in the day - she had the look and the sound down pat.I'm a Wyoming native, born and raised, and though just a bit younger than the characters of the movie, I did grow up in 1960's - 1980's Wyoming (the era of the story) and I grew up with those types of people - ranch and small town folks who worked damned hard just to make ends meet, drank too much beer, didn't ever show their feelings (regardless of what those feelings were), and just kept eeking out a stark existence day in and day out...worked hard, fought hard, played hard, but rarely smiled and never talked about things.The grand vistas of Wyoming (yeah, I know it was filmed in Alberta, Canada, but it was set in Wyoming), especially of Brokeback Mountain (which I interpret as being in the Big Horn Mountains), formed the perfect backdrop for the heart of the love story.  Surrounded by the majesty that Brokeback is, love just IS - no boundaries, no pre-set definitions or conventions, it just IS.  And, trust me on this, that is really how it is in those Wyoming mountains....love just IS....it lives on its own in the majestic bosom of the mountains - the pull of those mountains is strong...it lasts a lifetime - but taken out of that safe place, love becomes a fragile, and sometimes even ugly, thing.  That is why they had to go back to the mountains...never to Brokeback itself, for that would be too real and too scary for them...but into the mountains, where the beauty of that world shone a soft, safe light on their relationship.  The harsh glare of their home territories (Riverton, Childress) would have torn what they had apart, burned it to ashes...but in the mountains, they could hold it close and keep it safe.The ultimate ""lesson"" of BBM for me is that when you deny your dreams, you deny yourself...and sentence yourself to a life less than true.  Moral of the story: ~Be true to yourself...be true to your dreams...be true.~"	5.0	Lessons Learned on Brokeback Mountain	2006-04-11	64	56	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AC5ZFE26DCSMP	D. K. Harris	From the 1st moment I sat down in the theater, well after the final credits and up to now, there has been a knot in the pit of my stomach. There was a subtle undercurrent of suppressed violence throughout the film that was both tantalizing & disturbing. Brokeback Mountain, the story of a pair of rugged, hardscrabble young cowboys, icons of the American male who fall in love in 1963 Wyoming opened my eyes wide, sometimes in horror at what men who love other men had to endure. Victims of their place & time, yet their love did endure. The real power of the story is that this love came from the unlikeliest source; a pair of Calvin Klein underwear models in the canyons of Manhattan just wouldn't have the same impact. I have never been so moved by anything, either on film or in the written word as I was by this story. When the film ended I was emotionally drained, taking several days for the full impact to hit. It would seem the best talent in the industry went into its making. Ang Lee, Heath Ledger (astounding!), Jake Gyllenhaal (also astounding), Michelle Williams & the haunting score to name a few. Probably the most poignant scene I have ever seen in a movie is the scene where Jack (Jake) is standing at a campfire, hands in his pockets, Ennis (Heath) walks up & wraps his arms around him from behind, just holding him & gently rocking, their eyes closed. Gay, straight or whatever, we all yearn to share a moment like that of pure unfettered love. Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece.	5.0	Calling it a gay cowboy movie only diminishes it.	2006-01-19	13	11	2
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1JXF6Z23X8Y23	D. K. Harris	"After reading many of the other reviews it became clear there is a common misconception that Jack & Ennis returned annually to Brokeback Mountain to rekindle their relationship. In a beautifully crafted run-on sentence in Annie Proulx's short story she names all the mountains & ranges they traveled to in their times together over 20 years ""but they never returned to Brokeback Mountain"". In the film it's easy to see how everyone thought they were returning every year when Jack, in an argument with Ennis at their last meeting, gestured behind him & said 'all we have is Brokeback Mountain'. Brokeback Mountain remained for them iconoclastic, the only uncomplicated time in their lives, a time of unfettered love; when they felt as if they were the only 2 people in the world. After that summer they both moved on to marriages, children & in Jack's case, other men (which was probably the start of his downfall in Texas, word getting out in the rodeo circuit). But neither man felt any contentment or fulfillment with anyone else & after 4 years had an explosive reunion, unfortunately witnessed by Ennis' wife, Alma who had never experienced that depth of passion from her husband. Alma knew from that moment on that each time Ennis sodomized her (that 'thing he liked to do' started early in their marriage) he was recapturing the only real happiness he has known by taking his wife the same way he took Jack. Jack wanted to always be with Ennis from that point but Ennis, with his obligations & societal fears couldn't do it 'I like doing it with women but it ain't nothing like this, this has got no reins, it scares the piss out of me'. When Ennis sent Jack a message he was divorced, Jack joyfully 'redlined' it 1,200 miles to Ennis thinking they could finally be together only to find he had been mistaken. Again, Jack's heart was broken. Ennis, even at this point could not allow himself to move beyond his fears, terrified to live openly with another man; all Jack wanted out of life was to be with Ennis- willing to take the risks. Ennis felt he was protecting both of them from `the tire iron'. There was a light that shone from Jack that's heartbreaking to watch each time his hopes were dashed. Ennis always loved him deeply and didn't fully realize that depth until he found the 2 shirts from their Brokeback Mountain days carefully hidden by Jack years ago in his boyhood home- now too late to reach out for Jack. Ennis didn't realize until too late that Jack could have given him true lifelong happiness if he would have allowed it- he now knew Jack was the love of his life. There would never be anyone else for Ennis & this realization came with bitter grief, loss & remorse. 'Jack I swear', the last line in the film, said through a few stinging tears, probably meant that if he could he would hold Jack tight, never letting him go away again saying ""it's all right, it's all right""- just as Jack had always said to him when Ennis was troubled. For Ennis, finding those shirts obviously cherished by Jack, the stark realization of what he lost came crashing down on him, possibly realizing he may have, by denying Jack all these years unwittingly started the wheels in motion for Jack's death; a co-conspirator with Lureen. Jack was right, all they had was Brokeback Mountain. Truly a masterpiece, the film left me emotionally drained, took days for the full impact to hit & when it did, found myself bereft & grieving for these 2 men, 'as grieving as the high northern plains'."	5.0	Jack & Ennis Never Returned To Brokeback Mountain	2006-01-28	39	37	2
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AC63924IPU3IS	"DKMI ""dkmi"""	First of all, as a straight male, I was not at all interested in watching a love story about two men.  I happened to come across this movie on HBO one night and was immediately drawn in.  I really appreciated it as a work of art and social commentary.  It tells a great story without having to say a whole lot.  Perhaps this movie came out at just the right time - with the White House pushing for an ammendment to ban gay marriage and states putting the question of gay marriage up to a vote.Ang Lee directed what I would consider an accurate portrayal about the consequences of being forced into the closet.  Art imitates life like never before in this movie.  We've seen gay men with wives and children in politics outed (NJ Gov. McGreevey), and men in the entertainment industry caught living the lie.  What this movie does is show that being unaccepting of gays and forcing them into the closet is not only devistating for them, but for the women and children who unwittingly end up as victims to the closeting.  In my opinion, this is where the movie shines most.  Their relationships with their families are predictably horrible.  I tried to imagine myself in a reverse situation where I would be inclined to form a relationship with a man in order to live in a society unaccepting of who I really am.  Frankly, I wouldn't be able to do it.I agree with most reviewers in their praise of Brokeback Mountain.  The acting is very good.  The direction is outstanding.  I do have a few complaints though.  The sound is absolutely horrible.  Much of the dialogue could use subtitles.  The premise is a bit of a stretch too.  The love affair transcends decades despite no communication between them except for a few words on a post card to setup a trip together.  Long distance relationships are difficult when the two parties are in constant communication.  With the infrequency of their time together and hardly any communication in between, the two men would be more like strangers than to one another than a couple.  I also found that Jack's parents were needlessly odd, but we only see them for five minutes.	4.0	If Nothing Else, This Film Will Give You Something To Think About	2006-12-08	23	18	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A18S639JPY3821	D L Stewart	"First of all, I just want to lay it out there that I do not agree with most articles I have read by the professional reviewers on various web sites.  There seems to be a real drive in those reviews to emphasise the 'gay' aspect of the film and to make it seem as if the sole purpose of the movie is to make gay relationships more accepted.  The backlash of such reviews is the conservative side coming out and portraying the film as having an 'agenda'.  Unfortuenately this needless bickering overshadows the story of the film, which is a story of love, longing, and raw human passion.  Besides, though I don't know her personally, I'm quite sure that when Annie Proulx wrote the short story of Ennis and Jack, a gay acceptance agenda was the farthest thing from her mind.The story of Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar is so much more than a 'gay cowboy' movie.  It is a tale of the love that you want so badly, but for one reason or another can't have.  That one love that creeps into your life and blindsides you, completely unexpected.  You didn't ask for it and didn't want it but it's there and you can't shake it.  Ang Lee did a brilliant directing job in provoking that 'hole in your soul' feeling, especially in the scene where Ennis and Jack part ways after their summer together and know that it's all come to an end.  They can't go on together and Jack looks longingly in his rearview mirror as distance gains between he and Ennis.  Ennis, so overcome by the confusion of his feelings and sense of loss that he gets that feeling in his stomach like someone has stuck their hand down his throat and pulled out his guts and he ducks to the side of the road with a case of the dry heaves.  The whole scene is shot with such authenticity on the part of the actors that you feel like the characters do.  It's not beautiful, it's not poetic, it's not a good feeling, but you feel it and can identify with it because at some point in our lives, we have all had that agonizing love lost feeling.  That is where Ang Lee has hit pay dirt.  If you read any story by Annie Proulx, you quickly learn that she is not all about what is romantic, good, and right.  She is more about what is true grit, hard life, pure human emotion rather it is wrong or right and often the wrong and right are very blurred in her stories.  I feel that Ang Lee did great justice to the original story by being able to visually blur those same lines.The acting in the movie is superb.  I've read a few reviews that blast Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger for not seeming 'in love'.  Those reviewers must have a very candy-coated sense of just what love is.  I found the love between the characters to be quite blatant, just because they aren't exchanging roses and valentines doesn't mean there is no love.The character of Ennis del Mar is supposed to be very rugged and rough around the edges.  He's a man of few words, and even less emotion.  Certianly not one for endearments.  Ledger's performance as Ennis is spot on.  His quiet but rough nature is perfectly conveyed, especially in the reunion kiss scene between he and Gyllenhaal.  In that one motion of forcefully grabbing the character of Jack by the coat collar and banging him up against the side of the building only to lay one of the most passionately hungry screen kisses I've ever seen on him was breathtaking.  You get a real sense of the character emotion that carries throughout the movie.  I found myself empathizing with Ennis's ""you-dirty-son-of-a-bitch-how-dare-you-do-this-to-me-but-thank-god-you're-here"" emotion, and judging by the mix of smiles and tears in the theater, I don't think I was the only one who felt that way.  That kind of audience empathy speaks volumes for Ledger's portrayal.Jack Twist is a more emotionally charged character.  He knows he loves Ennis, and is happy for it.  He doesn't have the guilt feelings or the hang-ups in the relationship that Ennis does.  Jake Gyllenhaal embodies the rugged showman that is Jack.  Jack is the one that can bring the emotion from Ennis be it either by making Ennis laugh with some rediculious story or silly shenanigans or by pushing Ennis to the edge of his anger by laying the true emotions between them on the table.  Gyllenhaal puts the perfect spin on this character dynamic.  He's funny, emotional, loving, yet rough and antagonistic.  To genuinely portray such a multifaceted character is an attribute to Mr. Gyllenhaal's acting abilities.The two actors play so well off of each other that you find yourself entranced by them and it is very difficult to seperate the actors from the characters.  They blend so perfectly that it's difficult to imagine that Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist are not real people.  Though I am not an actor, I would think that bringing that intense of a believability to your acting is the penticle of what you strive for as an artist.  Jake and Heath reach that level with ease in this movie.I would recommend this movie to anyone, even my boss who swears that this movie has made John Wayne turn in his grave.  I think as an actor and an artist, and most of all as a human being, even good ol' Mr. Wayne would know the brilliance of this movie.  Even two weeks after having the Brokeback experience, I still find myself obsessed with Jack and Ennis.  This movie reawakened some lost feelings in me.  The sense of frustratiion, longing, and loss that happens to all of us.  It has reminded me of that gaping hole that is still in my heart that yearns for the one that I couldn't have.  This movie awakened a part of my soul that had been sleeping for a while, and for that I am eternally grateful to Annie Prolux for putting it out there on paper, to Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana for so genuinely rewriting it so it could hit the big screen, to Ang Lee for his brilliant vision and insight into human passion, and of course to the actors for bringing all of Prolux's rough-edged characters to life."	5.0	Who says love is all roses and smiles?	2006-02-22	34	26	8

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A30EH53Y32NUTT	"Doctor Whom ""The Doctor"""	"This was deleted somehow, so I am re-entering it.Ennis, the Taciturn Blond Guy, is the center of this movie. He says that he is not gay, and he is not gay. He is damaged, and cannot love anyone. For Ennis, love is a post traumatic stress disorder. As a child, his father had forced him to see a freshly murdered and mutilated gay guy- freshly enough killed that Dad might have been a material witness, at least. Then, Ennis' parents died in a car crash, and Ennis was raised indifferently by his sister. By the time we meet handsome, fit Ennis at age 21 or so, he has never had sex.He accepts his first love from Jack, who is gay. Ennis craves affection from Jack, but can give nothing back- no loving commitment. Is it because of viewing the murder victim, which would symbolize societal oppression of gay love? Well, Ennis cannot love his wife or kids, either. When Ennis goes away with Jack for phony fishing trips, he brings no fish or other gifts home for his kids, or his wife. What loving man would disrespect his children so, let alone his wife? Ennis favors Jack not because Ennis is gay, but because Jack will love him without requiring commitment.Jack gives up trying to make a life with Ennis, and finds some one else. Jack is murdered, as Ennis learns when he tries to arrange another secret rendezvous. Ennis' response to the horrid news is shock, loss, and grief- but NOT remorse or regret. Ennis does not say that if he had loved Jack as he might have, Jack would not have died. Ennis feels enormous loss, but no guilt or shame.As far as we can tell, and unlike what is the case with Jack, Ennis has no gay sex- and maybe no sex- after his divorce with anyone except Jack.After Jack dies, Ennis visits Jack's childhood home, where he encounters Jack's stereotyped, gay son-producing parents. Father is cold, and resentful of Jack and Mother's closeness. ""He thought he was too good to be buried with us"", says Dad. Warm and understanding Mom leads Ennis to Jack's bedroom, where Ennis finds the shirt Jack stole from him decades ago hanging with Jack's Jacket. Mom lets Ennis take the package, sending her son's loving soul home with Ennis.This is not a gay movie, making a case that gay love is better than any other, but only makes the case that gay love is as real as any other. As in many other movies featuring a gay character, the gay guy must die to satisfy the audience.I believe the movie is a hit because this is not a gay movie, and because as in traditional movies, the gay guy is punished with death.This is a movie about whether or not a man- Ennis- can love.My favorite scene is toward the end, when Ennis is admiring the numbers on his mailbox. He has an address, so he must exist! As is true on the internet, however, an address may not represent a real identity. Ennis has no identity- he can identify with no one, until at last he consents to go to the wedding of his daughter, who is nicknamed Junior."	4.0	not a gay movie	2006-03-08	19	7	12

Yet, they are enforcing the idea that traditional Western thinking of homophobia is the standard of the film. Instead of embracing such though provoking, and wonderful movie, they are what reviewer, Robert Frost, called ""Propaganda Driven Activists.""The comments they left are in no way helpful to the movie, and should not even exist on the review board.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AJTYBLH1HFEEB	"dogpizza ""i am the walrus"""	Warm, touching and inspiring, Brokeback shares many similarities to last years masterpiece Million Dollar Baby. They just move you in a profound way while showing you two people are capable of changing each others lives.In Million dollar baby, Frankie and Maggie have nothing, no family, nothing, but together they form a wonderful father daughter relationship which changes each others lives. Frankie doesn't just turn Maggie into a great boxer, but Maggie revives Frankie's ability to connect with someone.They both help each other psychically and emotionally. Ennis and Jack do a similar thing for each other. Ennis is a quiet, hurt man from a broken family with no reason for living really. But when Jack arrives, all of that changes for the better and for the worse. They both bring light into each others lives but the harsh realities make their mark. Both left me in a state of awe for weeks and raised my passion for human connection. Two people can make life worth living and both masterpieces have taught me that. I have now made a connection with a wonderful girl at my school thanks to these two masterpieces. I have seen the light of human connection.Unfortunately Brokeback will never have the honor of being the academy award winner for best pictur. But the film has made it's mark on many lives an A subjective award will never change that. This movie was announced on dvd yesterday and already many people, affected by it personally have come here to share those feelings with fellow fans. That is what movies are for in my opinion. To generate all your deepest feelings and inspire you to persue them and share them with fellow humans.I'm glad my favorite movie of 05 has made it's mark on so many people. I'd like to thank the makers of million dollar baby and Brokeback mountain for breaking new grounds while teaching me human connection can make life worth living but also have it's negative affects. The best film of 05 and perhaps this century. No stars can justify my love for this film.	5.0	Brokeback is this years Million dollar baby	2006-03-22	45	31	14
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1AYEI2SNFPYES	Dogville	"Having read the original short story by Proulx a few years ago, I was surprised by how well a tale of love between two cowboys set against a panaromic Wyoming backdrop was told. When I learned that the 60-page short story would become a film directed by celebrated director Lee Ang, I hoped it would be made soon.By now, most people would have associated Brokeback Mountain with gay forbidden love. The truth is, Brokeback Mountain is just a very simple tale of arduous love and anyone with an ounce of emotion should watch.The union of director Lee Ang, scriptwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, and the cast results in one of the most exquisite and endearing films made in the last few years.Lee Ang possesses the talent for slow, intricate and subtle film direction. He pays attention to almost every aspect from simple small gestures to complex emotional strifes set against the magnificent mountain view.McMurtry and Ossana also adapted the story faithfully except for the fact that the two male leads were originally much less desirable than Ledger and Gyllenhaal with bucked-tooth and stocky bodies.The assembled cast is the third link which leads the film to flight. Heath Ledger, the stoic straight-man type is caught unexpectedly in a tangled web of emotions for a fellow cowboy, something that had never crossed his less-than-queer mind. A man of few words, Ledger plays Ennis to perfection when he displays the inner turmoil that Ennis enountered trying to live his life the way it is and learning to love Jack. Every time Ledger breaks down and cries in the film, it's when you'll feel him.Jake Gyllenhaal is the hopeful companion who prays for the day that the union could yield the type of permanence he so craved for instead of ""a couple of high-altitude fs once or twice in a year."" And he waited for 20 years until the audience shares his anguish and unfulfilled yearnings by the time he lashed out on what they ever have left is Brokeback Mountain.Michelle Williams plays the silent, long-suffering wife who witnessed the earth-shattering and ultimately heartbreaking kiss shared between Ennis and Jack after 4 years of separation. Williams is exceptionally sorrowful, swallowing her unspoken hurt until she could hold it no more that she wanted to hear the truth out of Ennis' mouth years after her remarriage. Williams' acting powress is certainly validated by the expression she showed at the instance of that unexpected kiss and the heartwrenching exchange with Ledger.Anne Hathaway plays a rich girl whose expertise is in making money not relationships. Given her short screentime, her change from a brash rich rodeo queen to a high-society career woman and finally a emotionless and grieving widow expands her acting abilities beyond her impish Princess Diary-self.Many unions, liasions and break-ups later, Brokeback Mountain emerges as a tragic yet bittersweet and endearing tale of love between four suffering people afflicted with varying degrees of attachment but all not willing to let go. To me, this suffices as more than a gay cowboy story. To enjoy Brokeback Mountain, an open mind and eyes are definitely pre-requisites. (A+)"	5.0	Cold Harsh Mountain	2006-02-18	5	4	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3RTMB76CJWY9U	DonAthos	"The Movie:Brokeback Mountain is about two men who work together one summer in extreme isolation. They form a deep bond during their time there and eventually sleep together. Because homosexuality is not accepted in their time and place (1960's Wyoming), they deal with conflicted emotions and go their seperate ways into marriages. While married, they reunite from time to time, taking trips to Brokeback Mountain where they continue an on-again, off-again affair lasting several years.The two men feel differently about their relationship. Ennis (Heath Ledger) cannot bring himself to terms with it, and feels that it must always be hidden, in the shadows. His marriage suffers cruelly from it. Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), however, wants to embrace their relationship more fully (ironically, perhaps, he has the better family life, though it is always hollow for him). Ultimately, their relationship ends tragically. Ennis' family dissolves and Jack is beaten to death on account of his homosexuality.The film is quiet and powerful. The score and backdrops are sweeping and majestic. The acting is top-notch. The direction, excellent. The emotions, real. However one feels about the subject matter, this is a great film.Its Reactions:I have found the reactions to this film to be quite surprising. Friends, of whom I had never suspected any sort of bigotry, refused to go see it and only spoke of it with either irony or derision in their voices. And we can see in the reviews of this film here on Amazon (and the helpful/unhelpful votes) that it has provoked something intense and deeply-seated in many people.It is my opinion that love is love (though, so the reader understands my personal context, I am both a straight man and politically conservative). I understand that some others feel that the portrayal of homosexual love is part of some ""agenda""--they call it propaganda--but I don't think that, just because a movie presents a different point of view than your own, it makes it somehow sinister or manipulative. I hope that everyone here who takes the time to rate these reviews or write their own has taken time to watch the film, prior to commmenting on it. I think that the film, itself, proves that it is not out to manipulate or ""change society"" except in the ways that art always does, by ""holding the mirror up"" and allowing us to examine ourselves.Obviously, this was an important movie to make. The reactions prove it. While I had suspected that society was a little more sophisticated than to go crazy over a film like this, I was wrong. This is a dialogue we need to have. And so, to those who've seen the film and still wish to attack it, I actually want to thank you: while I disagree with what you believe, and the reasons you have for your attacks, its good that we have a chance to talk about it.Five stars for the film itself and five stars for the important discussion it has launched."	5.0	The Movie and Its Reactions **SPOILERS**	2006-03-02	23	21	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2BEU7GPGNIG44	Dorrie Wheeler	"Brokeback Mountain is now available on DVD.  Heath Ledger stars in the film as Ennis.  He comes from a difficult background and seemingly broken home.  He takes a job as a rancher and meets Jack.  Jack is a rancher working rodeo.  Their bosss (Randy Quaid) has them working on the top of Brokeback Mountain isolated from the rest of the world.  The two men bond like good friends.  One cold evening Jack invited Enniss into his tent so that he can keep warm.  They soon find themselves embroiled in passion. It's the sixties and homosexuality between Wyoming cowboys is taboo.  They hide their feelings and Ennis initially has a hard time dealing with the situation, even declaring it a ""one time thing,"" even though their trysts continue.  Ennis and Jack soon split up due to a change in their assignments. Ennis goes on to get married and becomes a father.  Jack still has a strong attraction to men but he eventually settles down with a woman.  When the two re-connect after time has passed they continue their hidden love.  Brokeback Mountain is a good movie, a little overhyped, a little soft porn, but a great story about two men living on ""The DL."""	5.0	Good movie about two men living on the DL	2006-04-04	21	8	13

Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece and the best Western (yes, it is a Western) romance I have ever seen.Unlike lesser films, there is no preaching, no moralizing, no grandstanding; nor does El Depresso hold the audience in too tight a grip.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AK5YEEBUA636B	Dr. Albert F. Inclan	What a great transcultural, transgender,transunderstanding piece of cinematography. Whether you are gay, straight, or undecided, this is a story about love, the emotion, removing all sexual connotations from its definition. It is the form of love that could happen between two men, as it is represented in the movie, but in its broader sense it is the form of love that can happen between any two people. It is easy to empathize with the loveless wife who sits in the shadows, but maybe one should look at the suffering of all three leads. After all it is not one, but three people who remain unfulfilled, because of the restraints put upon them by a society that tries to define love in what might be a too-limited fashion. To it all add beautiful cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack. If you are watching it with the one you love, or wishing for a love so pure, then watch it...it is very inspirational on many levels. It is hard to imagine a short 65-page story coming together into such a wonderful two hours of sheer entertainment.	5.0	UNIVERSAL LOVE	2006-08-25	27	23	4

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AFZGS9T5KTQ7B	dr_sign	I was a little wary because of the understandable hype surrounding the first truly mainstream film focusing on passionate love between two male protagonists. The camerawork not only invited us into their fiery intimacy (featuring, but not limited to, the kind of close-ups normally reserved for 'women's films') but also offered jaw-dropping panoramas of a beautiful landscape. It was without doubt the most powerful film I have ever seen, reaching deep into my own experiences and leaving me unable to control my tears. My only regret is that ultimately it offered us such a bleak picture of star-crossed lovers, but at least that reminded me of the greatest love story of them all.	5.0	Searing	2006-02-23	21	13	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3HCWEC28GQV0H	D. Scott	"Utterly objectionable - and not for the reasons you'd think.  Vito Russo's classic The Celluloid Closet exhaustively details how Hollywood films time and again deliver the same message about the fate of anyone who engages in ""the love that dares not speak (or in the case of Ennis Del Mar, mumble) its name.""  The heterosexual norm can only be maintained if gay lovers either die or end up miserable and alone.  Sound familiar?  Brokeback Mountain is hardly any different than outdated films and books such as The Children's Hour, The Victim, The Well of Loneliness or even Cruising -all of which scholars agree remain interesting primarily as documents of society's antiquated and harmful views of homosexuality.  Then there's the gay ""esthetic"" of the movie:  a cinematic rendering of the pathetic ""straight-acting, no fats, no femmes"" personal ad, with more than a touch of sanitized Advocate Men fantasy fiction thrown in for good measure.  I thought the real low point came about 3/4s the way through the movie when Jack, rebuffed by Ennis, goes to a third-world, film-noirish Mexico to seek out furtive, shadowy sex on what seems to be a leftover set from Touch of Evil.  The year is roughly 1978.  Yes, the height of the disco era.  I guess a weekend in L.A. or Dallas would have out of the question for him.  At this point the movie has its heels so firmly planted in the recidivistic 1950s celluloid closet of its own making, there's simply no hope.  The movie does raise some interesting questions however:  Were there any gay people involved in the scripting or making of this film?  Were there really no gay actors available to play these parts?  (Doth I protest too much?  Ask yourself this question:  how would the public react to a movie about two inner city black girls that was written by Ben Stein and acted by Paris Hilton and Gwyneth Paltrow....)  Leaving us finally to deal with message of the movie's sub-plot:  closeted gay fathers - in their quests to remain eternal Peter Pans - pose a threat to the institutions of family and marriage.  I can't imagine a message we need less right now in America!  The hype machines have been in overdrive about how this is a ""mainstream"" gay film where ""A-list"" heterosexual actors, writers, authors, etc. are ""unafraid"" to openly address gay issues.  Doesn't that sound suspiciously like kind of self-interested condescension that led recording artists in the `50s with nothing of their own to say to cover the hits of Ray Charles and Little Richard to ""sanitize"" them for white ears?"	1.0	The Icy Cold Mountain Stream of Loneliness	2006-01-06	162	45	117

No, I am NOT one of those gay hating baptist (if you want to be gay cool whatever) but I am a sane enough individual to admit that this movie was completely a gay parade of nonsense. The plot was in my opinion absolutely boring and idiotic. This is the message I got from this movie, ""When your atop a mountain and your all alone or your married it's okay to screw your buddy, because it's okay to be gay."" Honestly, come on! You have to be honest with yourselves. This movie was just sad in a way that makes you wish you wouldn't have wasted your time. I was hoping to see a beautiful love story that would have helped me understand the love and connection gay people feel. Will and Grace demonstrates a better example.

There, I've said it.  Very very un-PC but it's the truth.  I have nothing against gays or lesbians---in fact I have always been very ""gay-friendly"" from my mid-teens, with a lot of admiration for the pluck and creativity these individuals develop from coping with society's ignorance and bigotry.  But watching 2 guys kissing doesn't do much for me; I kept looking away during the sex scenes.So the female characters were much more interesting: Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini and especially the gorgeous Kate Mara.  They were literally like blessed rays of sunshine in a gray and desolate world.  I guess I'm just a sexist pig, LOL."	4.0	Beautiful film-making, BUT...	2006-07-05	48	11	37
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1IW7TCP0GPRL0	Ed Uyeshima	"It shouldn't surprise anyone that the opening weekend in San Francisco was completely sold out for this much anticipated film. I just read the brief, wondrous novella by Annie Proulx a couple of weeks ago, and despite its wellspring of emotion, the 55-page book didn't seem like a natural candidate for screen treatment, especially one with a running time of 134 minutes. What is most intriguing about director Ang Lee's 2005 cinematic adaptation is how it builds upon the elliptical nature of Proulx's narrative into something quite transcendent and relevant beyond urban, flavor-of-the-month movie audiences.Thanks primarily to an extremely perceptive screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, the much-discussed gay romance is not what separates this film from others but rather the penetrating depiction of the barriers that keep the two cowboys apart. As Lee has proven in previous films that go beyond his cultural identity, he can take what seems to be a niche subject and turn it into a love story with universal appeal to anyone facing an inhospitable environment. I join the chorus who feels it would be shame if potential viewers skip this movie on the preconceived and misbegotten notion that it is simply a ""gay cowboy"" romance.Initially set on the mountain of the movie's title in Wyoming, the plot focuses on taciturn ranch hand Ennis Del Mar and animated bull-rider Jack Twist, both hired for low wages to herd sheep during the summer of 1963. One cold night, after we see several scenes where they get to know each other and acclimate themselves to their roles, they enter reluctantly into a passionate tryst. While the more open-minded Jack is excited by the feeling of liberation, Ennis is steadfast in his self-inflicted shame and rejects Jack's dream to own a ranch together. Having witnessed as a child the remains of a man lynched for carrying on a gay relationship, Ennis is afraid of the same fate. However, they both recognize an intractable bond that they try to ignore with great futility.Four years elapse, during which time both get married and have children. Ennis marries longtime sweetheart Alma and raises two daughters. Jack has since moved to Texas and married Lureen, the daughter of a big-time farm equipment dealer. He decides to come back and visit Ennis, and their pent-up passion is sparked and becomes unbridled. They begin to take romantic getaways together for the next two decades under the guise of fishing trips. A twist of fate brings Ennis an open resignation to his unresolved feelings even as his now-grown up daughter attempts to get to know him.The performances are uniformly strong. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Jack in his familiar, wide-eyed manner since it fits his character's more idealistic personality, though he becomes marginally less convincing when he ages. As the wives, both actresses are removing the shackles of previously limiting roles. A graduate of the TV teen-angst soap opera, ""Dawson's Creek"", Michelle Williams continues the promise she showed in Thomas McCarthy's ""The Station Agent"" by revealing the increasing pain and unrelenting sadness in Alma, alternately realizing and denying what is going on between Jack and her husband. Anne Hathaway seems to be jettisoning her goody image from Garry Marshall's ""The Princess Diaries"" in a hurry as Lureen - first as a feisty rodeo girl not afraid to get sexually aggressive with Jack and then in a series of unfortunate blond wigs (from Farrah to Loni Anderson), as a savvy businesswoman growing indifferent to her husband's lack of attention. It's the smallest, least developed part of the four principals, but she makes her moments count.However, it is Heath Ledger who amazes as Ennis. This heretofore almost strictly commercial actor has tapped deeply into the agony of his character's soul with authentic force and poignancy. It's a career-defining performance of a man who cannot let his internal stirrings affect his outward appearance. It's Ledger who makes the intimate scenes between Ennis and Jack seem so desperately charged with emotion and regret. Smaller roles are filled expertly - Randy Quaid as the suspicious sheepherder boss; Linda Cardellini - completely unrecognizable as bespectacled Velma from the ""Scooby Doo"" movies - as the waitress who tries hard to bring out Ennis' heart; and Kate Mara as Ennis's loving daughter. The panoramic vistas of Wyoming (actually Canada) are provided by Rodrigo Prieto's stunning cinematography, and the evocative music score is by Gustavo Santaolalla, who did similarly stellar work in Walter Salles's ""The Motorcycle Diaries"". I am hopeful there is a broader audience than the enraptured critics, as the rest of us are also being rewarded with a superbly executed film."	5.0	A Soaring Ledger Emboldens Lee's Powerful, Evocative Portrait of Self-Limited Destiny	2006-05-14	25	21	4

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AIWDJ3S85O10Q	Edward Aycock	"It's unfortunate that so many people were not willing to see this movie, whether they thought it was ""anti-family"" or ""glorifying a depraved lifestyle"" or other such nonsense.  It's unfortunate that film reviewers like Michael Medved went on the air and, channeling his inner eight-year-old girl, said ""Ieeewww"" when asked about this movie, or that over the hill Hollywood actors like Tony Curtis and Ernest Borgnine saw fit to proclaim they'd never vote for a movie like ""Brokeback"" for Best Picture.  It's unfortunate because ""Brokeback"" is an excellent film, and it's an incredible story of heartbreak and loss.""Brokeback Mountain"" is both epic and intimate.  Set against the openness of the West (gorgeously photographed by Rodrigo Prieta who does double duty playing a Mexican hustler in the film), ""Brokeback"" is no allegorical love story; it's the painfully realistic tale of Jack and Ennis, the ""pair of deuces going nowhere"".  Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger, especially Ledger, do an excellent job portraying two men who fall in love, even if they can't really understand or want to understand what they're feeling.All the actors are well cast, but again, Ledger steals this movie away as Ennis del Mar.  The final shot of Ledger's face is as haunting as that of Giulietta Masina's in ""Nights of Cabiria"".  This is one of those movies where everything just comes together so well, (the music, the cinematography, the acting, the mood) that your faith that good movies can still be made is renewed.I really hope that everybody who said nasty things about this film (and turned the movie into a national punchline) will take advantage of the relative anonymity of home video and see it. It may not change any minds, but the devil ya know is better than the devil ya don't; the only thing they have to lose is the rental fee."	5.0	Pair of deuces going nowhere	2006-04-04	51	45	6

Affectionately dubbed the ""gay cowboy movie,"" viewers everywhere giggle naughtily whenever it's mentioned. However, those who cannot get past that will seriously be remiss in viewing one of the most powerful love stories of all time.This is the story of Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, two cowboys who meet each other in the summer of 1963 deep in the mountains of Wyoming. They are both hired to herd and protect a large flock of sheep through the mountains for several months. Every day their friendship progresses little by little as they spend the summer working with only one another. One night they are shocked to discover that their friendship had transformed them into lovers. This begins a tumultuous relationship that spans twenty years of broken relationships, deception, and ultimate tragedy.This film is amazing in every sense of the word. It is beautifully directed and executed. The stunning cinematography displays the stark beauty of the American wilderness that mirrors the wild, untamed love between Ennis and Jack.Heath and Jake's performances were legendary. I honestly have never seen better performances from two straight male actors in terms of heartrending, accurate portrayals of homosexual men during a critical time of the history of American society. This is a story that is moving and haunting. It stays with you and reverberates through your soul for a long time. It is a movie that will continue to affect me because it revealed to me the brutality of human nature, and how love is so powerful that it has the might to act simultaneously as salvation and destruction to so many lives.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1H57S6ZRGQG84	"Elder Dave ""adman62"""	"I've seen many films in my time and been moved by many. I and a great number of people I know--churchgoers, executives, professionals, garage mechanics, athletes etc.--have been nearly unanimous in admitting that this film broke their hearts whether they were straight (a majority of those I know) or gay. ""Brokeback"" reaches deep into the spirit to touch the existential loneliness we all feel, however loved we may feel ourselves in this life. Amid the stark contrast of lush cinematography of the natural world and the bleakness of man's deteriorating structures, Ennis and Jack have a gnawing hunger to escape this loneliness through each other, and, when that proves impossible because of the interdiction imposed by the time and place, through what passes for a ""normal"" life of marriage and children. This is a disaster for Ennis and Jack both, a profound agony for Alma, a painful realized truth for Lureen, and aching sadness for Ennis' daughter, Alma Jr.Everyone knows the story by now, but you have to be there as so many people have commented to me, when Ennis breaks down in Jack's arms at (what they don't know to be) their final meeting. Ennis realizes for all of us, whatever our lives have been, the crashing of the house of cards we've built on an emotional relationship--the fear of changes Stevie Nicks sings about in ""Landslide."" He is facing the Void and is himself empty.This film has more depth than any other I've seen in a long time, surely the best by a hundred miles in the last year, including ""Crash"". Ledger's performance is way beyond what his young years would make us expect. It is a finely textured rendering of a lost soul barely holding it together--not even the estimable Ang Lee could have gotten that out of an actor less supremely talented; Gyllenhaal brings his ""A"" game as a perfect counterpoint to Ledger. All of the women are amazing, right down to the waitress who fruitlessly falls in love with Ennis.This is a ""must-see"" film for anyone whose god is not a homophobe, for this is not a ""gay"" film by any means, though it includes gay people as just another part of the human family, which is what they are. This is the story  of the human heart stripped to a sad ultimate truth. We each feel that truth in a different way, but we feel it nonetheless.The DVD is fine. The extras are skimpy but fine. Truthfully, the film is so overwhelming any person with a modicum of sensitivity will watch the film several times and not care very much about ""extras"".

It's hard now to separate the political influences and media hype that have surrounded this picture from the beginning. But try, and you will be rewarded with a moving experience that will stay with you for a long time. I think many people are put off by Ang Lee's slow and deliberate style.  We are not used to strong character development and staying in the quiet moments.  However, Lee's masterful style fully brings to life the people in Annie Proulx's famous short story.  Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway are all magnificent in their portrayals.  The acting is true, and never feels melodramatic or cliched.

The film is about two men who fall in love quite by accident in the summer of 1963 while they are tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain.All of the characters in the film are baffled by this ""thing"" that has happened to them because it did happen to them even if they were nowhere around when Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist first fell in love.  Heath Ledger, who plays Ennis is excellent.  Ennis allows his fear of what this love means if anyone finds out, to color the way he walks, talks, and ages.  In spite of the fear though, Ennis finds a way to be with Jack, even if it is for only once or twice a year.  Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack Twist is haunting as Jack tries to persuade Ennis that they should give up their marriages, buy a ranch together, and live the ""good life"".  Michelle Williams, as Alma, Ennis' wife, steals a scene as Alma witnesses an embrace between Ennis and Jack that she knows is going to deprive her of the life with Ennis that she craves.  Anne Hathaway, who plays Lureen, Jack's wife, portrays in a telephone scene how Lureen has sunk into a bleached-blonde cold shell of her former self.Ang Lee orchestrated this ""thing"" that happened to these people beautifully.  The passion between these two men that spans twenty years is as sweeping as the landscapes.  The audience members are left with craving such a passion in their lives if they've never had it; if they have, they are left with wanting to foster and protect it if it's still there or to cherish and seek it again if it isn't."	5.0	Love Is Love	2006-04-21	47	37	10

I knew what the plotline was, I knew where it took place and I knew that I wanted to see it.  I never expected to be completely blown away by it.The performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are phenomonal.  Ledger plays the 'brooding' Ennis with such clarity that you feel like he is Ennis.  Gyllenhaal's character is the 'go-getter,' the one who is not afraid to 'be in love.'  He plays Jack with such passion and vivaciousness that its hard not to cry when he tells Ennis that ""He can't quit him.""In fact, my only problem with this movie is the not the movie at all but that society dictated that they weren't supposed to love each other and therefore, never told one another how they felt...although they both knew how the other felt.It is an excellent movie...one I will be purchasing as soon as it comes out to DVD.

Their romance continues over the years, hidden they believe, from those around them.I read the 65-page version of this originally 11-page short story by Annie Proulx way back, and found it an enjoyable read. When I heard they were bringing it to the big screen, I wasn't particularly enthusiastic, as it seemed to me a hard one to script and bring the emotions and thoughts of the lead characters to light. I suppose my preconceptions may have spoiled the experience for me somewhat.It's a great story, and the screen adaptation is about as good as it can be. Both Gyllenhaal and Ledger do an outstanding job in their roles as Jack and Ennis (Gyllenhaal hasn't gotten the credit he deserves for this, in my opinion), and their supporting cast, particularly Williams as Alma, Ennis' wife, do an extraordinary job of showing that not only Jack and Ennis are suffering from their predicament. All said, the film comes across as just a bit too long, and at times a bit boring. By the end, I was a bit eager to see the credits roll.I won't demean what this film has done in bringing gay issues to the fore, particularly in the more Southerly States. While the subject matter of gay ""cowboys"" (these were sheep) is supposed to be daring, it's all a few years too late. Proulx's work, at the time it was written, DID, indeed, break new ground.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3LGR1ME0F03FR	Eugene Fenlon  BA	When I first heard of this movie it had a small hype, as it delt with the contraversial subject of homosexual cowboys in the 60's.  The first thing that grabbed my attention, was the sheer brilliance in cinematography.  The landscape and surroundings of Brokeback Mountain is extremely detailed and rich in colour.  The relationship between the two leads becomes stronger and stronger as the the film goes on.  Until the both sleep in a tent together and instinctively embrace.  The story continues with their relationship as they both turn seperate ways and try to live their lives, resisting the urge to be together.  Their relationship is obviously complicated as they can't be seen together in public, and the only way they can see each other is Brokeback Mountain.Their are terrific performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall (spelt wrong, I know), as they struggle with their lives.  Although their is some fantastic acting, it is the story and the way it was told that let it down for me.  The story wasn't as powerful and as emotional as I had expected.  Their are also a few uncomfortable scenes dealing with domestic violence that are brilliantly acted out.Overall, this was an OK film, and a film that everyone would enjoy.P.S.  I know a lot of people really like this film, but for me it was the story that dissapointed me.  If the story was better, I would give this film 4 stars.	3.0	A very powerful drama, but let down by story.	2006-05-25	32	14	18

After i saw the movie, all i could think about was how unbelievably depressing this movie was. These men, are just two guys who happen to fall in love with each other. And this doesnt seem to be the kind of love we have today. This is soulmate, eternal love...the kind that seems it will go on for ever. And then this tragedy happens. (And Heath Ledger's acting in this part was incredible). You really start to think about how much he wanted to live his life with Jack, but he couldnt because he was afraid that it end in one of their deaths, but it still does. And i thought that maybe if they had had their life together, this might not have happened, and that's the tragic thing. This movie has really made an impact on the people who have seen it.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3UGJ1ZRODSBLG	Film Lover	"First off let me just say, wow, everyone was right, as a straight male I can truly say this movie touched me in a way no other film ever has. BBM definately deserved the Best Picture Oscar, and what makes me mad is that I really liked Crash, but thanks to the Academy I cant watch it without thinking, how could they choose this over a masterpiece like Brokeback.So most of you already know the story so I'll tell you about how this film affected me. My girlfriend wanted to go see this movie last week and I was actually pretty excited. I saw the previews and thought wow finally something original from Hollywood after a year full of crap. So we went and after the movie was over there were of course people crying but I didnt know what to feel, I thought the ending sucked but the acting was pretty good.Then I found myself thinking it over on the ride home, and all night I dont think I said more than two words to my family, and then as I was getting ready to go to sleep I started to tear up, I called my gf and she had the exact same reaction. Brokeback is a movie that definately touches you, not because its a gay romance, but because its a beautiful parable about loneliness, love, and what it means to be a man. I was reading a review about BBM and what it said was true. BBM was needed because the gay community has become a joke in this country, sure shows like Will and Grace and Queer Eye are out there but it just reinforces the stereotype that all gay men are fashion obsessed, feminine, and funny. Well I have gay friends, and most of them are just like me, theyre regular guys who do manly things and who just so happen to be attracted to other manly man because God made them that way. BBM definately does a lot of good in showing a more realistic side to the gay community.So like I said I hated the ending at first, then I went back to see it this week because I couldnt stop thinking about it, and it was even better the second time, I realized that by ending the way it does BBM shows the courage and strength that gay men have to go through to come out. I found myself asking that if I were gay would I have had the courage to give up everything I ever knew to be with the person I loved. Honestly I dont know if I could, I can sympathize with Ennis because I grew up in his situation, my father and mother have always preached against the sins of the world, including homosexuality, I dont know how Id ever be able to tell them if I were gay. Likewise almost everyone has that doubt that Ennis has, that wish that you had done something to make you happy instead of making everyone else happy, wheter its pursuing a relationship, career, or dream, we all have our regrets in life. What gets to me the most and what caused me to become one of those weeping audience members at the end of the second viewing was that Ennis does what he does in order to protect Jack, and unfortunately it kills him. I truly believe it wouldve been different had Ennis & Jack bought that ranch.The acting is phenominal, Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest screen preformances in history as Ennis Del Mar. Phillip Hoffman won the Oscar this year and I really liked his preformance, but Heath has so little to work with and yet is so heart wrenching. He's able to convey so much by just saying ""Jack, I swear"" than most actors could show in a whole film. Expect this role to pop up on AFI's list of greatest preformances sometime very soon. Michelle Williams is also a revalation, that scene where she sees Ennis and Jack kissing and essentially sees her world crashing down is so powerful without being showy, and Academy I have a serious complaint, Rachel Weisz, WTF? To say that her preformance was better than Michelle's in Brokeback and Amy Adams in Junebug, you have got to be kidding me, guess being pregnant buys you some serious points doesnt it. Now as for Jake Gylenhaal, the first time I saw BBM I actually didnt understand him, he didnt seem to have any sadness at seeing Ennis go that summer except for when hes in his truck, than I realized why, he was being strong for Ennis, he was essentialy saying im your rock. Its a tough preformance that you have to see more than once to truly appreciate but Jake nails it perfectly. Anne Hathaway as Lureen isnt really given much to work with, but that phone call with Ennis shows shes way more than just a one note actress.Yes, im rambling but its because BBM touched me so much its hard not to praise this film. For all those giving it one stars, you obviously havent watched the movie, because its so much more than two guys having sex, which by the way probably consists of 30 seconds of screen time and almost no nudity save for a shot of Jacks butt which if you cant handle that than how did you ever get through the gym class locker room. Also for all those saying homosexuality is a sin, and BBM glorifies it, the characters end up heart broken and alone, if anything its an anti-gay film, or at least would be if the scenes between Jack and Ennis didnt show that these two men obviously love each other completely, and I was raised Catholic, I believe god loves every one of us and gay people are born that way, and I think theyre put on this earth to teach us what real love is.Brokeback is definately an instant classic, and will go in my DVD collection right next to Citizen Kane and Million Dollar Baby as my all time favorites. And for those who felt it got shafted at the Oscars, dont worry, Citizen Kane, the greatest movie of all time got 1 Oscar for its screenplay, theres no doubt in my mind that BBM will be remmembered far longer than Crash, and that it will be way up on the AFI's list of the greatest movies of all time."	5.0	Brokeback Mountan sure got us good	2006-03-19	445	415	30

You could actually turn off the soundand just look at the facial expressions and gestures and you wouldstill understand the story. Heath Ledger as a lonesome cowboy issimply breathtaking. His pain and sadness, expressed with few wordsand gestures is absolutely heartbreaking. It is amazing, how a twentysomething year old man understands such a complex character and heshows it in every single gesture.Ang Lee's images are extremely powerful. You can almost smell thegrass and feel the wind. He knows exactly what he does, no second is wasted.I love his understated and subtle style of directing.There is a lot of silence, but the atmosphere is always intense and emotionally charged.The movie is more than the sum of its parts, though. I can't find alogical explanation for the fascination that this story has for so manypeople around the world. ""The secret of Brokeback Mountain"" (That's thetitle for this movie here in Europe) will always be kept together withJack's ashes up there in the Mountains.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1X12F0KC8GY6M	FLbeachbum	"Well boy howdy; I finally got around to viewing ""Brokeback Mountain"". During the early part of it, I thought it a bit slow and began to wonder if it wasn't past my bedtime. At the same time however, I thought the cinematography was stunning; making me wish I was in a proper cinema (as opposed to seeing it on my 20"" screen).Gradually I opened up to the story and the way it was presented, and lo and behold, by the end of the film I felt it worthy of the praise it has received. And in retrospect, I believe that it HAD to be revealed just as it was, in that somewhat plodding cowboy style. Kind of made me think of ""A Prairie Home Companion""'s characters Dusty & Lefty from *The Lives of the Cowboys* (couldn't help myself; if you're a PHC listener, you'll know what I mean).Sometimes I was frustrated by the behavior of the two lead characters, but that doesn't diminish the quality of the movie. For example, I wanted to suggest (before their subsequent marriages), that Jack & Ennis just DITCH that cowboy life and head for San Francisco or NYC or some other place more congenial to their relationship. But alas, there were other things to be considered as well; not the least of which would be the backgrounds and limited education (and hence opportunity) for these two, especially Ennis with his taciturn manner.But my point is that in mulling over the possibilities, I took the characters of Jack & Ennis very seriously, as they were very convincingly portrayed by Gyllenhaal and Ledger. I forgot that Heath Ledger was Australian; he had that mumbly mealy-mouthed American cowboy bit down pat. And Ang Lee's direction turned my early-on yawns into rapt attention. Now I would like to watch the movie a second time (at least); something I seldom do. Please bear this in mind if you're tempted to give up on ""Brokeback Mountain"" halfway through, because you're ""bored"". By the way, the basis for this movie is a short story written for ""The New Yorker"" by Annie Proulx.Also I'd just like to mention that if a gay man in the U.S. West had limited opportunities in 1963, it seemed to me that women (gay OR straight) had even LESS to choose from (sigh).

I do not feel it is necessarily controversial because it is not centered around the identities of two people as much as the journey of many who are in the film.  The film is about two men in sixties who are working seasonal work as sheepherders of sorts.  They are actually cast well as people from this time in the West.  Two cowboys who have not much more than the shirt on their back.  Soon they realize they both have a fondness for each other.  They also realize they are going to be going their seperate ways.  As time moves on through the next twenty years, the two men try to meet when they can.  What is great about this movie is the story is something anyone can identify with regardless of their sexual preference.  Its a great STORY.  The film is also good in showing us lives of other people like their wives and families.  The vison that flashes across Enos's mind when he hears of Jack towards the end of the movie is very sorrowful and had a large impact on me emotionally.Some people thought the movie was slow but I honestley thought the pacing was perfect.  Movies that move ""slow"", if done right, are great because it gives us time to absorb the settings and characters within the timeline.  If written well, as this movie is, we don't fall asleep, but are instead captivated again, by the story.  There are also beautiful scenic shots throughout the movie.  A quiet and friendly environment that had people in it whose inner feelings are strong and yet hidden.  I just think its a great story and don't understand why there was so much hub-bub about it.  I encourage anyone to watch it.  Its not about a certain lifestyle, but about life, love and the pursuit of happiness which sometimes is found, in one way or another."	5.0	Simply a great story	2006-04-26	48	39	9

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2VE83MZF98ITY	"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick"""	I recall a short story version of Brokeback Mountain many years ago in a major periodical (alas, I can't recall the periodical). I had an idea that it would, in the fullness of time, become a major motion picture, and that it has. It is an award-winning film already, and looks set for some sort of Oscar recognition.  The film has garnered more Oscar nominations than any other this year.However, in the hype surrounding the film, those interested would be wise to look at the book. There is much more depth here than in the film, much more about the interior workings of the main characters and what they must endure. This is ultimately not a love story, as the marketing has been spinning the film, but rather an expose on the dangers and drawbacks of living in the closet. For the purposes of this story, Annie Proulx has juxtaposed two diametrically opposite cultures in the American psyche - the gay culture and the cowboy culture (although history is, as it often is, in fact rather different from what the Hollywood-created current remembrance of it is). One comes to wonder at the resistance that all characters seem to have for breaking free of their bonds; ultimately, none of the relationships are satisfying, and there is an emotional desolation as wide and spare as brush land and prairies of the American West.The lead characters meet while working for the summer as wranglers and watchers over herds. They form a bond that renews at regular intervals during their lives, lives that go on to other, more traditional and socially acceptable settings. Each gets married, each has children, each embarks (in one way or another) in a working life that would seem to preclude the other, but yet the tie that binds them draws them together again on a regular basis.The closet theme is heightened in the lead characters, but in fact serves as a metaphor for readers who might not fit in that particular closet - we all have skeletons in our closets, it seems, and in fact, we all have our own closets in which we hide and live out part of our lives.This theme is played in out in several scenes of the film - Ennis Del Mar finding his shirt intertwined with Jack's shirt in Jack's closet, which Ennis then proceeds to put into his own closet.The last scene is perhaps the most powerful of all, drifting to a final image.  Ennis' daughter, having announced her marriage plans, drives off into the dusty plain; Ennis is living in isolation in his own trailer which has next to no furniture (his daughter comments that he needs a chair); and the very final shot is of a closet door, kept closed until Ennis is alone, with a view of the mountains in the far distance just outside the window beyond.In terms of overall cinematography, this is a beautiful film.  Ang Lee's direction has provided wonderful panoramic views of the mountains and the plains, the not-so-wild west of America, mid-century.  This is a world very different from either coast - the trends of the cities in New England and California have little effect on life here, which goes on generation after generation with an unrelenting sameness.Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal, fresh from his role as a marine in 'Jarhead') and Heath Ledger (whose film 'Casanova', playing at the same time in the same cinema in my town, cast him in a very different role) play the leads of Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar, two down-on-their-luck wranglers who get a summer job camping out with sheep herds in the mountains - the kind of 24 hour/7 day-per-week job that virtually nobody wants.  Jack is the extrovert, whereas to call Ennis an introvert might win the Oscar for understatement.  At one point, Jack points this out, after a conversation that only lasted for about a minute.Jack Twist: 'That's more words than you've spoke in the past two weeks.'Ennis Del Mar: 'Hell, that's the most I've spoke in a year.'Ledger's portrayal of Ennis is remarkable in that Ennis seems to be almost inarticulate.  Everything is said in a grumble, a low-level, low-syllable-count manner.  Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Jack as the ants-in-his-pants, high-energy bronco buster cowboy is also very enthralling.  Jack's passion for many things comes through, and through the film we come to discover (as Ennis comes to discover) that this passion comes with a high price.Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams play the wives of Jack and Ennis, respectively.  Both want 'regular' lives, and both discover there is more to their husbands' relationship than fishing-buddy friendship in different ways.  In some ways, the film reminded me of another film, 'Same Time Next Year', in which a couple gets together on a regular basis while maintaining stable, family relationships elsewhere.  However, there is a price to be paid for leading such double lives, and we see this manifested in different ways in the lives of Ennis, Jack, and their wives and children.  Again, the issue of the closet comes into play.Of course, the big 'issue' for the film is homosexuality and homophobia.  That this takes place within the almost-sacred genre of the American Western also adds to the heightened interest - the mythology of the American cowboy being a super-macho figure has already been developed as a gay stereotype by such groups as the Village People and what sociologists might call costume-culture communities.  The unspoken secret that rarely made even a mention on Hollywood screens was that cowboys, being isolated much of the time, and in male-only communities when they did have company, almost certainly had a higher incidence of same-sex expression than we have come to believe through the mythology.Ennis and Jack do put physical and emotional expression to their passion and to their love for each other, but societal expectations and personal feelings (what some term internalised homophobia) work to keep them apart and leading separate (and dual) lives throughout the twenty-year span of the film.There is no happy ending to this film - I left the cinema with a feeling about as desolate as the dry and dusty plains shown in many of the scenes.  I found bits of the music score coming back to me for days afterwards, and each time this happened, I would feel a bit more sombre, and a little bit lost for words.  The original themes by Gustavo Santaolalla and Marcelo Zarvos are very well done, and this is a soundtrack I mean to get.I won't predict that it will win the best picture Oscar, but I am not surprised it is one of the odds-on favourites for winning.	5.0	A mountaintop experience	2006-02-17	34	21	13

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has been described as ""a gay love story.""  It is true that the story concerns an on-going relationship between two men, but this is merely the pebble director Ang Lee throws into the pond; the film itself is about the ripples the stone makes, and by examining them in meticulous fashion BROKEBACK creates a portrait of the way human beings are distorted by both external and self-imposed repression.  It is a powerful film, an artful film.  It is also one of the most painful films I have seen, the sort of film from which you emerge with a stunned sensation, and a film that lingers in your mind for a very long time afterward.In terms of plot the movie begins simply enough.  Two ranch hands, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), are hired to tend sheep on Brokeback Mountain in the summer of 1963.  Ennis is a very self-contained man.  Jack is more outgoing and is presented, in a relatively subtle way, as a man who is open to sexual possibilities.  As the summer progresses they become friends, and as Ennis opens up emotionally the two suddenly begin a sexual relationship.  Although they are careful to tell each other that they are not gay, and although the words ""I love you"" never cross their lips, the relationship develops into a romantic one.  But all summers must end.  The two men, struggling with emotions they are ""not supposed to have"" for each other, leave the mountain and each other.  Both men marry; both have children; both go on with their lives.But the stone makes ripples in the pond.  Ennis, more so than Jack, is utterly unable to accept the idea that he is homosexual--and yet when Jack seeks him out several years later it is Ennis who leaps at Jack both sexually and emotionally, and what began as a seemingly transient affair rapidly develops into an overpowering relationship that they must conceal from wives, children, and society--and the consequences of concealment are devastating for all concerned.  This is particularly true of Ennis, who has few internal resources, who is more afraid of social retribution, and who can neither let go of Jack nor bring himself to agree that they can live discreetly together.  The result is a series of internal tragedies, failures, losses, and frustrations, all of which create a deep and abiding pain from which there is no escape.In terms of art, the film is beautifully crafted.  Director Ang Lee approaches his material with a sparse grace and an eye for the telling detail, presenting the characters in such a manner as to allow you see them in the fullest possible way.  He is greatly assisted in this by the remarkably powerful script by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, which translates Annie Proulx's memorable short story to the screen in both brilliant recreation and illumination, and by Rodrigo Prieto's simple yet compelling cinematography.  The cast is fine beyond all possible expectation, never sounding a false note, and we believe them from start to finish.  Nothing is either overplayed or underplayed; there is no artificially heightened drama; no manufactured element any kind.  Indeed, with the single exception of an occasional make-up effect, it is virtually impossible to fault the film on any level.  Is it a great masterpiece?  I think it may well be.  Time will tell.The film has been controversial on several fronts, but most particularly for the homosexual relationship that forms the spine of the plot.  Some critics have seen this as evidence of ""Hollywood's leftist agenda;"" others have stated that the film is the best possible argument for same sex marriage.  To adopt these attitudes, however, is to impose ideas on BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN that do not actually exist in the film.  It is a rare example of a film that does not tell you what to think; it simply presents a story of what things were like, and in some respects are still like, for gay men and their families in America.  It leaves you to make your own judgement about right, wrong, and where sympathy should reside.In closing, I will make an cautionary observation: while I strongly recommend the film, I must note that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN will likely take a toll on many gay viewers akin to the toll taken by PLATOON on Vietnam vets.  I think this will be particularly true of gay men from largely rural and small town backgrounds and who are presently in their forties or older.  It is profoundly painful to see elements of your life undergo this sort of extremely public autopsy, and had I realized the accuracy of the film I might well have elected to wait for a release to the home market.  Having said this, I also note that in a visual sense BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN really requires the breadth of a movie screen, and I do recommend that it be seen in that format if at all possible.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"	5.0	Quietly Devastating	2006-01-31	35	30	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A36JXQDWV08MSY	"Gary Gil ""Gary Gil"""	Brokeback Mountain is a powerful a movie that takes the audience on a beautiful but sad emotional roller-coaster ride. It is a tragic romance in the vain of Romeo and Juliet, or is that Romeo and Romeo. Take out the petty, feuding Montagues and Capulets and substitute the vicious stereotypes of 1960's Middle America, complete with gay bashing, homophobia, and self-doubt. This movie is shocking commentary on how far we have come and, if you want to know how far we still have to go, just look to the movie's R rating. There is nothing in this movie that deserves the R rating. It is given that rating solely for the reason that the two main characters are both males. There is very little sex and nothing particularly graphic. It is simply a love story. It is sad that our society is so quick to show children men killing each other, yet so hesitant to show them falling in love.	5.0	It Matters Not Who You Love, But That You Love	2005-12-16	26	23	3

It recently came to the forefront when I saw a stack of DVDs in my local warehouse club. I was tempted to buy, but didn't. But the sight prompted this review. This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Absolutely stunning.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a tragic love story, and it's tragic on every scale. It was set largely in rustic and scenic Wyoming (actually, Alberta) and it unfolded as two young men met as employees of a local rancher. Their task was to care for a herd of sheep on Brokeback Mountain over the summer months. They gradually became friends and then ""special friends."" At the end of the summer, they parted and went on with their lives including getting married and raising families. The experience of Brokeback Mountain, however, proved too strong and they gradually started getting back together again, and again. The result was an aching love story and a growing tragedy for the men, their families and all concerned. The story riveted my attention and was painful to watch. My girlfriend and I left the theater and we couldn't talk. We were both choked up by the emotional impact. We discussed it for the next several months, however. The movie was that powerful.Everyone associated with this film should get an award of some kind. The director gently reached out and grabbed hold of the audiences' attention. He then allowed the tragic story to unfold amid a spendid scenic backdrop and accompanied by wonderful music. In watching it, you feel as if you're a part of the story, or at least a fly on the wall. This film is amazing and very powerful. View it, by all means. If the subject matter bothers you, don't buy and complain. This film deserves a lot more respect than some of the coarse remarks in certain viewer reviews."	5.0	Stunning!	2007-05-02	25	23	2

There isn't enough hype and hooplah about it!!!!! Get it more publicity and out of the ""closet"" so everyone can enjoy it. Fantastic scenery, excellent casting, wonderful soundtrack, and a storyline as beautiful as it is controversial makes Brokeback Mountain a classic before its time. Ang Lee did it again. The story is about deep love and devotion (who cares if it is between 2 men?) and how no obstacle can stand in the way of it. You soon forget that the two people in love are same sex and concentrate on the aspect that even though forbidden, they manage to endure obstacles that prevent them from being together permanently from living in different states, loveless marriages, nagging in-laws, money, and the fear of being ""found out."" I found my self both empathizing and sympathizing with Ennis & Jack on their quest to happiness. I was totally numb and glued to my seat and could not move at the ending! I sat there in tears as the credits rolled by wanting to see more and hoping it would have ended happily. The last film I cried in was ""The Notebook,"" another credit to everlasting love. Yes, men do cry at films; there is nothing wrong with that. I say if you can cry at a film, then the director made his point and the actors earned their keep. The love scenes between the two men were very tastefully done and not shock value for the sake of selling tickets -- it again reiterated the story line of pent up emotions that finally erupted and were long overdue. Heath and Jake were perfectly matched in their roles. I was so moved I bought the soundtrack, the book, and am waiting for the DVD to be released to ad to my collection. This film is a ""must-see"" even if you are not open-minded to the topic of the plot -- see it for what it is worth -- entertainment from a top-notch director bringing a short story to life specatularly."	5.0	Finally an honest movie worth its praise!	2006-01-24	16	15	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A8LLLJI17SG1N	"George L. Jone ""Watcher of movies"""	I think reviews have been summed up nicely, so I will add some observations.Let me first state that I live in the bible belt, Oklahoma.  Imagine my surprise when I viewed this film with my partner on a Monday afternoon in a fairly full house.  One look around and I discovered that we were not amongst a crowd of gay males as I had expected to be, but a very diverse audience.  This included 2 very straight looking cowboy types with a woman.I point out all of this, because it appears as though people have now started to come to their senses and give movies a chance to move them reguardless of their content.Now for my impression of the film itself.I could not wait to see it from the moment I found out about it.A special about it on the LOGO network made me want to see it even more. I almost made a trip to Dallas because I didn't want to wait for wide release.Well, it finally came here, I saw it and let me tell you, it was well worth the wait.I have rarely been moved by a story, either in film or in print, as much as I was moved by this movie.  I left the theater on the edge of tears which came later on my trip home, and it was all I could think about for days.Now, today, reading these reviews, some of those tears are back. I am amazed at the number of men who have written glowing reviews and I suspect many of them are straight.Please tell all of your friends to open their minds and hearts and see this film, I think many of them will be surprised.And one final observation:  As I was leaving the theater, a rather long line had formed, and talking later to a friend of mine, I discovered that was the case when he saw it on a Sunday.This renewed my faith in people to give movies a chance reguardless of the possible controversial content. Perhaps this will usher in a new era of thought provoking movies.  Don't get me wrong, I love movies that don't take much thought but are alot of fun, but lets have more movies like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.It will be sad if the Academy fails to give it it's due.	5.0	The most moving film I have seen in years.	2006-01-19	14	13	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3BWP965RIWBCU	"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker"""	"I saw ""Brokeback Mountain"" in the theatre, here in the Abitibi (of Qu&eacute;bec) when it first came out. The film repulsed me and I found it very distasteful. Then I read the novella on which it is based and found that much more sympathetic and, actually, quite touching.Comparing notes with a friend, who is also gay, it seems that some of the dialogue that was so cynically misogynistic in French lacks that acerbically anti-women character in the original English dialogue of the film, so a reconsideration is due. Why the French dubbing, at least as heard with the film here in Qu&eacute;bec, added so much gratuitously anti-female bias to the film is hard to comprehend. I am not very sympathetic to feminism, but there are limits to how much a film ought to insult the female of the human species!Although it goes beyond what Annie Proulx' novella and the film recount (but intertwining those two sources), the full-length novel presently available on the WWW (and hopefully to appear in book form), ""Brokeback Mountain: the Novel, 1943-2006, the Births, Lives, Times, Secrets and Deaths of Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist"" (by a beefily handsome author who goes by the pseudonym ""Jet"") adds some depth to one's appreciation of the characters in the tale. The story is erotised (but not vulgarly so) beyond what there has been already, but in a convincing and vivid way that does not cheapen the tale in any way.The novel opens some episodes or other bits, some of considerable potential interest to many viewers, which were excised during the editing of the film, which may be what most highly interests fans of the motion picture, at least until a truly comprehensive ""director's cut"" edition of the film, including these passages, may happen, at last, to appear. Jet's novelisation even fills in Jack and Ennis' childhoods and their parents' stories, a really fine part of what this new novel accomplishes. Jet also carries the story forward into decades after the times of the action recounted in the original novella and in the film. Jet's new novelisation needs to be taken on its own terms, of course, but I recommend it to other readers.There is much in ""Brokeback Mountain"" to arouse interest and one's emotions. Whether the original novella or the motion picture, repeated viewings and readings do help for the tale's message to sink into one's conscious memories of it, and Jet's full-length novelisation helps that further.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3RAWU8HSCN3IM	Gerry	"More than a great love story, Brokeback Mountain is a powerful relevant film because it shows the costs of homophobia which is still a current problem for some. It shows how Ennis' internalized homophobia affected the lives of the two lovers (Jack and Ennis) and the families surrounding them. And this makes their story all the more tragic.Director Ang Lee shows this in a very subtle, subdued manner which is one of the best films assets. And the movie grows on you and the effect stays long after you've watched it.If you get the DVD, watch out for the other scenes you might have missed like the exchange of glances between Jack and Ennis while Randy Quaid picks up the phone during their initial briefing; the interchanging of shirts which I read somewhere is Heath's suggestion; the long distant glances while sheepherding, etc.My favorite scenes are definitely the last encounter between the two and the flashback ""sleeping like a horse"" scene afterwards.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A15Q9YEG1XPEJN	Get What We Give	"Brokeback Mountain is a film of epic proportions! All involved in this project should be extremely proud of themselves. The film is an Ansel Adams photo come to life, yet with an emotional center that no previous ""gay"" film has ever had.Too many films have been made about young men coming out of the closet. There's almost a cookie cutter mold for creating these films. Maybe that's part of the reason that this film is so fantastic...it's not about coming out. It's about the far more realistic - not hiding, but simply controlling your feeling, burying your love and remaining ""in"" the closet. Good or bad, that is what many gay men force themselves to do. Is it bad? That's not for anyone but those men involved to determine. Is it detrimental to them and their lives? Again...For Jack and Ennis (gyllenhaal and ledger), as cowboys in the early 60's all the way through the early 80's, coming out of the closet or even hiding in full view is just not an option. It ""doesn't play"" you could say.Oh, Jack is willing to take the chance - he's the risk taker of the two, but Ennis...no. Ennis knows what awaits them if they dare openly face their ""dark"" side.So instead, for over twenty years, these two ""straight"" cowboys, each with a family of his own, meet clandestinely at the ""scene of the crime"" - at Brokeback Mountain for a week or so a couple times a year and they maintain their passionate love affair.Are they gay? Are they straight? Are they hiding? Do they really love each other? I'm not going to tell you. That would be spoiling the film for you.Suffice it to say, that no major studio, no major director, no major actors have ever tackled a film of this stature or magnitude. Oh, don't give me the crap about ""Philadelphia"". It was a cop out. Hanks and Banderas never kissed. They never related to each other. No, this film is the one that will forever be seen as the film that broke all the stereotypes that went before. It is the film that will be referred to in film history books as the one that broke down the walls.Every actor in this film is firing on every cylinder. Ledger, who up until now, I thought was a light weight pretty boy, delivers a tour de force performance. He's the quiet, yet very much NOT the introspective man. He just doesn't have much to say. He swallows his words but you can see every thought as it rolls across his face. Ledger should have the best actor performance nailed. Gyllenhaal, too, delivers a performance of amazing depth and emotional range. His anger...his desperation... his loss... towards the end of the film, is palpable. Michelle Williams (Ledger's actual wife) as Ennis' wife cannot possibly be the same actress who played Jen on Dawson's Creek. No way. This actress is masterful and mature and you certainly can feel her pain. Her face tells the whole story. Randy Quaid and Anne Hathaway also deliver absolutely phenomenal performances. This is a vehicle for some of the best performances you'll ever see on film - ever!This is the film that lets the world know that even the most masculine of men can find deep within themselves an aching need that, no matter how hard they try, cannot be suppressed by playing it straight. These two men tried against all efforts to fit the mold society set for them. But as Jack says, ""I guess ol' Brokeback really got us good."" They are bound to each other.Does it have flaws? Yes. It's overly long. Twenty minutes could have been shaved off. However, with this film I'm beginning to realize why all of Ang Lee's films seem to drag on too long. He wants to take us along the road with each of his characters to the most complete of jumping off points. He wants us to fully understand them. Is it always effective? No. However, he is the director. And his past efforts are certainly example enough of how masterful this director is. I'll grant him his extra time so long as he continues to show us the true emotional center of characters, instead of relegating an entire character's reason for being to a single line of dialogue as many American films do. Lee's films are much more realistic and allow the audience to truly connect with the characters.I'll be buying this film for certain. It warrants watching over and over (if nothing more than for figuring out what the heck some of the characters are saying from time to time).Simply awesome!"	5.0	Emotionally charged epic with a gay centerpiece!	2005-12-19	31	26	5

And there isn't a single scene that I didn't wish would last just a few more minutes.  Not a snoozer in the bunch.  From the first scene, where Jack and Ennis are eyeing one another outside the office, the tension between them begins to build.  By the time Ennis and Jack decide to switch places on the mountain, even a blind man could tell you it's going to turn into a love story.  You already know that one night, real soon, those sheep are just going to have to sleep alone.The rest is a 25 year history of a secret love affair.  A quarter century of pain and suffering by two men who couldn't or wouldn't risk bringing the jagged, broken pieces of their lives together, even though they knew how perfectly they fit together.  In the end, they run out of time and options. It all becomes a story of what could have been.	5.0	Fences weren't made to be straddled	2006-04-14	40	30	10

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A21XVS00AIENLX	"G. Jennings ""G. J."""	Ang Lee once again creates a masterpiece on screen with yet another angst-ridden drama.  This time the story is between two cowboys who spend time together sheep herding on Brokeback mountain in the summer of 1963 and continue their relationship for the next 20 years.  While the women in their lives suffer emotional neglect, the real angst in this movie is depicted in the moments when Jack and Ennis are spent apart.  It is said that absence makes the heart grow fonder, but Jack and Ennis feel its effects doubly so.The cinematography is absolutely stunning.  The soundtrack is quiet, simple and honest.  The actors are perfectly cast and well-depicted.  I was quite surprised by Anne Hathaway's performance.  She nails the Texas accent and the attitude of a wife whose marriage very quickly became a loveless convenience.  Additionally, our wholesome heroine from the Princess Diaries is no more after Hathaway's first topless scene with Jake Gyllenhall.  Seems like everyone is growing up in this film.Because the movie involves some very sensitve material that is not yet widely accepted by the public, I do caution to those who are uncomfortable with homosexuality that this film is not for you.  There are a few love scenes, short yet somewhat explicit, that might cause you to squirm in your seat or quite possibly gag.  Conversely, homosexuals would find this movie both sad and endearing.  You should add it to your DVD collection.This is a very good story, well filmed and by far Ang Lee's best work to date.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3AT03ZVFI995D	Glenn Camhi	"Brokeback Mountain is a rare film that can offer you a different experience each time you see it -- it's good the first time, but amazing the second. That's usually when people who didn't get the fuss ""get"" it. Like me.It's easy to miss a lot the first time. There is almost nothing on-the-nose in this film. Most of the emotion and story is found between the lines, unfolding almost like a mystery. (E.g., it's difficult to catch the profound significance of the two shirts -- and the order they're hung in -- upon the first viewing. Paying closer attention on second viewing reveals a great deal of importance that happened off screen, and changes how you interpret various scenes.)One doesn't usually expect such subtle intricacies that require multiple viewings from a drama/romance, but the revelations and new understandings you do get from a second or even third viewing of Brokeback are greatly rewarding. This is partly because of the tremendous nuance in the story & performances, and partly because of the clever order in which things are revealed. Because so much is masked and unspoken among the characters, the whole truth or underlying emotion of many moments are veiled from us until long afterward. I strongly recommend seeing it again.When in the theaters, some folks praised or panned Brokeback merely for its subject matter, but both agendas belittle the greatness and scope of the film. It's an expertly told and gorgeously shot subtle drama about the irrepressible power of both love and fear. I'd say it's also about the clash of idealism vs. rigidity, responsibility vs. desire, and deep passion vs. a particularly masculine inability to express emotion.Heath Ledger's aching performance is mesmerizing. The New York Times rightly compared it to the best of Brando and Penn. There's more brewing beneath the surface in his Ennis del Mar than we'll ever truly know -- and that restraint is what allows us to discover new layers each time we see the film. It's as if he capped a volcano and never lets more than a wisp of steam out here and there, yet we can sense the smoldering in the depths. Few lead actors have evoked so much with so few words -- and at times so little of his face, as Ennis likes to hide his eyes beneath the safe brim of his hat, making his direct glances all the more potent. Add to that the subtle ways his voice and body change as he ages 20 years, and you have a performance that I suspect will go down in film history as one of the greats.Jake Gyllenhaal, whose Jack Twist is a little less hidden, also delivers a stellar performance of alternately bottled up pathos and spurts of idealism. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway shine equally bright as Alma and Lureen. Hathaway's transformation from spunky young rodeo barrel racer to 40 year old Texas businesswoman shuttering her emotions behind a stoic veil is gut-wrenching.Not a false beat exists in this movie. Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana have so faithfully adapted and artfully expanded Proulx's story in their Oscar-winning screenplay that Proulx said she felt like they (and the other filmmakers) had reached inside her head.The Oscar-winning score by Gustavo Santaollala (whose score for 2004's The Motorcycle Diaries is another of my favorites) is appropriately spare, haunting, and beautifully evocative. He packs more emotional punch with a single guitar than another composer could have with the London Phil. I do wish it were longer, but it's all the film needed and is definitely worth getting once you've seen the movie. Brings it all back.Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is gorgeous, from the breathtaking mountain expanses to the muted indoor scenes wherein the light is as simple and evocative as the story. Prieto is as gifted with natural (or natural-seeming) light as the great Rodger Deakins. Judy Becker's production design is so dead-on it's hard to imagine it's not all real.I cannot think of a recent drama that has held me in its grip quite like Brokeback Mountain has. Like Proulx's original story, the film powerfully knocked me out of my own life and has haunted me since.However... it's hard not to let all the praise lead to overblown expectations. As well done as it is, it's ultimately just a simple tale about a handful of average folks struggling with their emotions. Because it avoids an easy and false catharsis, it can leave you wanting more. Which is another reason that a second or third viewing is more powerfully moving than the first. It does not easily let you go when it's over.What greater wish could a film lover have? The personal impact of Brokeback Mountain on me was that it made me treasure love more.In a year of some great contenders, Brokeback Mountain still stands out to me as the best film of 2005 -- the one that will probably last with me the longest. For what it's worth, it won more Best Picture awards in 2005 than any film in cinema history, and was the best-reviewed film of the year, on more Top 10 lists and rating #1 on more lists than any other American film."	5.0	Best Picture 2005.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ANP46RYUYH2BH	Gloria J. Green	This is the saddest love story I have ever seen, bar none!  Whether you're gay or straight this story will have a profound effect on many many people.  I believe a lot of people can relate to having a love so strong with another individual but due to certain times, situations, demographics, jobs or other possibly uncontrollable circumstances this love had to stay hidden.  I went and saw this movie three times at the theater and cried my eyes out each time.  Jake Gyllenhaal gave an outstanding and very emotional performance in this movie!  My heart just went out to him (Jack) and he is the reason for my tears.  Heath Ledger also gave an outstanding performance as (Ennis) who just seemed so confused about his heart and feelings.  When I first heard about the movie it was two gay cowboys.  I thought na, not interested.  Started reading reviews and it is so much more.  It makes you think of all that wasted time that could have or should have been spent with that individual.  It was about Love, Wasted Time, and watching your life pass by.  I will definitely buy the DVD when it comes out on the 28th of this month.  This is the best movie I have seen in years.  Powerful, sensitive, heartwrenching and just really makes you think about life and love.  These are two people who didn't look for but found love in an unusual place.

They speak more eloquently than I can.  I concur that this is a gem of a movie.  Also, its a tragic love tale that happens to be about gay men.  The night after seeing the movie, I couldnt sleep.  The no win situation of the characters from the start, the lives of the women they marry and the kids they father, its as tragic as any classical greek piece could be.  I also wonder, as did another reader, how a short story that takes an hour to read could be extended to a 2 hour movie, but it flows well.  I've purposely not gone to see it a second time because when I do, I want to give it my full attention again.  Its stellar.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A374CTOURY9GL0	Godwhacker	Brokeback Mountain is, perhaps, the most powerful movie of the year, which takes the audience on a beautiful but sad emotional roller-coaster ride. It is a tragic romance in the vain of Romeo and Juliet, or is that Romeo and Romeo. Take out the petty, feuding Montagues and Capulets and substitute the vicious stereotypes of 1960's Middle America, complete with gay bashing, homophobia, and self-doubt. This movie is shocking commentary on how far we have come and, if you want to know how far we still have to go, just look to the movie's R rating. There is nothing in this movie that deserves the R rating. It is given that rating solely for the reason that the two main characters are both males. There is very little sex and nothing particularly graphic. It is simply a love story. It is sad that our society is so quick to show children men killing each other, yet so hesitant to show them falling in love.	5.0	It Doesn't Matters Who You Love, But That You Love	2006-05-23	22	20	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	E. Annie Proulx visited a cowboy bar in Wyoming and felt an underlying eroticism seething in that most macho of possible places.  That observation translated into a courageous short story in 1997, a study of love between two cowboys whose world would never condone such feelings (remember Laramie?), and so 'Brokeback Mountain' was born in New Yorker Magazine.  Now that tender and heartbreaking tale of hidden, durable, passionate love between two young men trapped in a society that will not allow such feelings has been luminously transformed in to a film: it is rewarding to see how successful that long journey became.The story is so well known that it need not be summarized beyond the brief statement that two nineteen year old young men, both with histories of abandonment, need, and pain, find physical attraction in the cold nights on Brokeback Mountain while guarding sheep, and though both assure each other that neither is gay, the love creeps out of the night physicality into the daytime sunny thrills of feeling alive and cared for. After only a couple of months, their job completed, they part ways, each marrying, having children, but over almost twenty years they periodically reconnect, understanding the depth of their forbidden love, and cope the best they can.  Divorces ensue, promises of being together permanently are thwarted by a number of reasons, and the while the story evaporates into the lonely landscape of Wyoming, the love that bonded them, a love they could never 'own', ends.Ang Lee molds this magnificently poignant love story with grace, style, realism, and bravery.  Proulx's story is made visual by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana's screenplay and while the script is true to the story on the whole, there is much added business about the wives and children and parents that perhaps is necessary for moviegoers to 'get it', but in this viewer's mind is less sensitive than the extended silences within the vast spaces of Wyoming that made Proulx' story so quietly and powerfully understated.  Heath Ledger is superb as Ennis Del Mar but Jake Gyllenhaal is equally as strong as Jack Twist: together they create a chemistry racked with pain as well as bliss and make their characters totally believable.  Michelle Williams does well as Ennis' long suffering wife Alma, while Anne Hathaway remains Anne Hathaway, a lady far too elegant to be convincing as the cowgirl Lurene the Jack marries in the vacuum without Ennis.But criticisms are few (the only major one is that Gyllenhaal has not been sufficiently recognized for his brilliant portrayal in Heath Ledger's shadow).  This is a beautiful film that addresses love and all its permutations and it is so refreshing to see a story of this depth and significance so quietly and tenderly placed before the theater audience.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 05	5.0	Discovering Love: The Longing to Make It Fit	2005-12-17	26	23	3

Devoid of any exploitation and containing little violence, ""Brokeback"" emerges as a wonderfully written, skillfully directed story of two men, circa 1963 that are unable to share their love openly. The performances range from excellent (Jake Gyllenhaal and - especially Michelle Williams) to the amazing, career-defining performance of Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar. Known beforehand as a pretty-boy Austrailian Actor, Mr. Ledger masterfully keeps Ennis Del Mar's emotions as tight as a balled-up fist as he is incapable of to show Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist the depth of his love. The final 30 minutes of this film are as wrenching and honest as anything committed to film. Don't miss this film"	5.0	Amazing Film with Spectacular Performances	2006-03-20	52	46	6

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3LU79BYMWZEW9	Gregor von Kallahann	"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has already generated enough buzz--and enough controversy--to muddle one's critical faculties for, I dunno, maybe the next five years.  And much of the commentary seems to amount to so much posturing.  From what I've been reading, the most sophisticated response (arguably) is something along the lines of ""It's pretty good.  Beautifully photographed. And very well acted.  But it's really just a love story--in cowboy drag.""  Yikes!  I'd rather listen to the gushing praise or even the indignant blanket condemnations.Not that the movie is perfect.  There were moments when I thought that it had fallen in love with its own arty sketchiness.  Short scene after short scene to be telegraphing the message: you're just getting the outlines of what you need to know and no more.  I guess I have more of a literary sensibility than a purely cinematic one.  I wanted to get to know all the characters better.  And though I understand that the movie only had a couple of hours to lay out the events of 20 years, I would have appreciated more than just a glimpse at the events of a given year, more of a sense of the flow of time.  Not just ""Oh look, the toddlers are teenagers now.  I guess we're in a new decade.""But a fluid representation of time is always hard when a story arcs over a lengthy period: doesn't matter whether the source story was a lengthy novel or, as it was in this case, a short story.  (Or for that matter, if it's from an original screen play.)  So maybe that's quibbling.  I will give them credit though: they certainly have come up with better age make-up (or is is the aging technique done digitally these days?).  Twenty-somethings Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger really do look fortyish by the end of the movie.  Only the buoyantly youthful Anne Hathaway seems not to have aged at all (only tarted up a bit by bleaching her hair).But I digress. The reason a viewer might want more from the story is because what IS there is handled so well.  This is the story of circumscribed, hardscrabble lives made all the more difficult because the characters find themselves dealing with feelings and issues that they can only begin to fathom.  They don't talk much, which is what the  Big Sky culture they were raised in seems to demand of men--and women--of the time.  But the movie gives the lie to the myth of the strong silent type.  Of course, this is years before ""Oprah-speak"" entered into the culture--and in this particular neck of the woods, that kind of ""sharing"" probably has (for good and for ill) yet to make much of a foothold.  In the case of Jack and Ennis, it would seem to be pretty much FOR ILL.  These are people who cannot risk opening those emotional floodgates.And that's not just true of the men.  On one level, this is the story of two men are struggling with their feelings for each other (in a world where such feelings are unacceptable).  But as many have noted, it is also the story of the women that they marry and the children that they father.  In fact, the one performance that I would say is close to being a shoo-in come awards time is likely Michelle Williams subtle performance as Ennis's (Heath Ledger's character)long-suffering (but not a forever suffering)wife.  Her performance has been described as heartbreaking, and it is.  But it is precisely her character's verbal inarticulateness in the face of an overwhelming realization that lends meaning to her every expression and gesture.Watching the movie, I was reminded that one of the few other things I have seen Michelle Williams in was HBO's lesbian themed IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK 2.  In one of that film's episodes, she played a proudly defiant young lesbian student in the 1970s.  That TV movie was much more schematic than BROKEBACK, but the two films, when considered together, actually do suggest something of the difference between the pre- and post-Stonewall mentality.  And of the significance of geography and social class as factors that may allow gays and lesbians options in how to lead their lives.  1970s middle class students from the East had more options than rural poor kids from the Far West had in the early 1960s.But of course, there are strong social and political forces even today who would have it otherwise.  Before the film began, I heard a man a few rows ahead of me complaining to his (female) companion that ""Born agains don't have a clue.  They say it's all about behavior.  It's about identity.""  Well, he would have little argument from me.  But life--and this film--are still even more complex than that.  I can readily imagine that if fundamentalist Christians (or Jews or Muslims) actually might be willing to view this film, they might well come to a conclusion that would only confirm their beliefs.  They might say, ""See, these men are fully capable of having a relationship with the opposite sex, of siring children, and establishing a family.  It's only out of selfish lust that they refuse to do so.  And that leads to their downfall.""That IS a possible interpretation, I suppose.  The film's more liberal target audience (myself included) would likely come up with an alternate analysis, namely that if these two people who loved each other lived in a world that accepted their difference, they never would have been forced into marriages that they did not want and could never find fulfilling.But ultimately that's not quite it either.  Good art like BROKEBACK is less about getting across a moral or socio-political message than it is about portraying life as it is lived.  That's another difference between this and, say, IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK 2.  This is less of a tract and more of a portrait of some people's lives.  And it rings true.Which is about all you can demand from a work of art."	5.0	Some People's Lives	2006-01-10	7	5	2

Highly recommended to those with an open mind, and can somehow relate to two men being in love.  The movie is tragic, yet rewarding.  One can relate to the ""living a lie"" scenario as it is so common today.  Even those who opose the gay life style need to give credit to an outstanding director, excellent cast, and most of all the beautiful scenery, which is a pleasant change from the congested, and urban setting.  I am eager to own this movie.  I would encourage people to see it, as it is a reminder to appreciate what, and who you have, because you never know when it, or who you have may be taken away from you.  I would have much rather have seen a happy ending, but life isn't always about happy endings.  It's just life, and this movie will tear at your heart.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AEV640MKB3I9J	Hank Drake	"""Great books make terrible movies,"" has been a cinematic rule of thumb for generations. Commonly, the problem lies in trying to compress a lengthly novel (usually digested by the reader in small chunks) into a two hour movie--the action becomes telescoped, the motivations of the characters trite or simply incomprehensible. Less frequently, an attempt to remain faithful to the text results in a bloated monstrosity which is equally hard on the patience and the hindquarters.At 55 pages, Annie Proulx's Brokeback Mountain is ideally suited for the silver screen. The adaptation by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana is faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the short story--much of the dialogue is lifted from the book verbatim. The film highlights the books' contradictions: epic, yet intimate; stark, yet lush. The characters speak in their silences as much as in dialogue. This is a story that could be only set in America. Yet, it is an irony that Asian born Ang Lee has directed a definitive American masterpiece.Much will be made of Brokeback Mountain's treatment of homosexuality. But sexual orientation is not the main issue. Honesty is. None of the four main characters in Brokeback Mountain attain happiness--and it's all because of the lie. Ennis and Jack fall in love while herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain in 1963. It is chalked up to loneliness and horniness, and written off as a one time deal. Ennis marries Alma, while Jack marries Lureen. In 1967, Jack and Ennis reunite, and the lie perpetuates. Alma spots them kissing and denies what she sees. She never even mentions it to Ennis until a decade later. Ennis and Jack continue to meet sporadically over the years. Given the era and the culture, there are no options for them to live openly. By the time he's 30, Ennis has deteriorated into a virtual automaton, only fully human when he's with Jack. Ennis and Alma divorce in 1975, while Jack's marriage cools into a business partnership. Unless one is honest with oneself, and in turn honest with others, one can never be happy, and the sorrow spreads like a disease.So the great lesson of Brokeback Mountain is age old: To Thine Own Self Be True. Lies, obfuscation, and concealment poison the soul--more than any sexual act or deviation from religious doctrine.Every aspect of Brokeback Mountain is outstanding: cinematography, editing, makeup (the characters convincingly age twenty years without overdoing it), music (just enough to highlight the story). But it's the acting which will stand out.Heath Ledger's performance is masterful. He plays Ennis as a terrified loner, hiding his emotions beneath a gruff exterior, his cowboy hat shielding his eyes. Ennis is so controlled by his fear that his heart breaks just as he realizes he has one. Jack Twist is a more open hearted character than Ennis, easier to read, and because of this Jake Gyllenhaal's equally commanding performance may be overshadowed by Ledger's. But he merits recognition as well. These are both stunningly brilliant actors in full command of their resources. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also deserve kudos for their strong supporting roles.Regardless of the viewer's or sexual (or political) orientation, or gender, Brokeback Mountain is the must see movie of our time. Just as 1939 is remembered as the year of Gone With the Wind, generations from now 2005 will be remembered as the year of Brokeback Mountain."	5.0	An American Masterpiece...	2006-01-04	37	32	5

I saw this movie because I love movies in general and will see anything that seems interesting to me.This is a beautifully shot movie with breath-taking scenery that perfectly depicts the lonely and sometimes harsh beauty of Wyoming.  The acting is good by everyone, but I agree with a previous reviewer that what was missing between the two main characters, Ennis and Jack, was the true intimacy of two people falling in love.  The desperation and sexual wanting between the two was obvious, but not the deeper love for one another.  Anyway, it was aching to see that for the next 20 years in the movie, Ennis and Jack must sneak away to Brokeback Mountain in order to be themselves, and spend the majority of their lives living a forced lie out of fear, obligation, responsibility, etc.  It made me wonder how many of us live that way - not being able to be ourselves.This is definitely not a ""feel-good"" movie, so if that's what you're in the mood for, you should see something else.  But if you want to see something that will make you pause and think, this may be it.

It shows so tenderly how they struggle to maintain lives which fit the accepted norms, and only end up damaging the happiness of not only themselves, but their wives as well.  More importantly as the film slowly treks across twenty years in the lives of these men, we see how this experience changes them, and how Ennis's character, in particular, grows over the years.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1P7R49FSQK9C	helterskelter	the film is a fiver, but this collector's edition didn't quite cut the mustard with me. The package is nice, and the cards (one a replica of the one Jack sent to Ennis!) are great, but I'm mainly interested in the bonus material, and that was pretty mediocre. A lot of comments from people involved in the film, or film people in general, but especially the exclusive 'reactions-to-the-film' segment should have probed deeper into the reactions of the average American movie-goer, both good and bad. Since the film caused controversy it would have been fitting to address it properly to show that many movie-goers actually changed their minds about homosexuality after seeing the film, and that the film transgressed this theme.The overall impression of the bonus material is that of an internal affair, which is a pity since this film is very much addressed to the public.

Whatever, that was very tame by some independent film standards, however to me the most shocking thing was seeing Ella Enchanted's Boobs! ELLA of Frell! Who commanded you to do that??The men take the attention here, but Michelle Williams performance was the real outstanding showcase here.  However I do give credit to Mr. Ledger.  He has a way of totally consuming and becoming a character, although at times he came off like Billy Bob Thorton's Sling Blade character ""Um hmm, I want to quit you...and have biscuits and gravy"".  Ledgers vast and diverse characters are commendable and this is a prime example.Over all, I thought the story was a little lacking, missing some key elements of people who are supposed to be in love.  I mean the ending, come on...we at least deserved ashes being spread across Brokeback Mountain with a montage of flashbacks and sappy song.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A9I40WFF40R4	"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin"""	"At long last after one of the longest and best orchestrated promotions, ""Brokeback Mountain"" opened on a limited showing, which I believe translates into art houses in large cities. Even in Atlanta, Georgia it is now playing in one midtown theatre in a neighborhood where there are more rainbow flags visible than flannel shirts.The film is beautiful to watch if a bit too long. That is to be expected since Mr. Lee had the task of fleshing out a short story into a two hour movie. It is easier to express passage of time with two sentences than on the big screen with two characters who essentially are nonverbal, a second problem as the director had to show a lot of what was going on between the two lead actors with only body language and facial expressions. Additionally, in the short story by Annie Proulx that Mr. Lee and Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana based this movie on the men are not particularly attractive. For instance, in the Proulx account Jack Twist has buckteeth; there ain't nothing buckteeth about Jake Gyllenhaal's smile. He is almost too handsome although he does put on weight as the years pass by.These are minor complaints, however. The movie should not be missed, not only by gay audiences but by the rest of America as well. Both lead actors do a fine job as do the minor characters, particularly Jack Twist's wife. The message is clear: in 1963 in Wyoming-- as in the rest of America-- two masculine ""Malboro"" men could not have had an open relationship. If they had been hairdressers and town outcasts, maybe. On the other hand, love in whatever form it takes is not to be missed. Isn't that what living is all about anyway?While Mr. Lee, who by the way, is one of our best and most innovative directors-- he never repeats himself-- deviates some from Proulx's story, he keeps the essence of it. In the very end of the movie he adds a poignant touch by having Ennis hang his shirt outside Jack's on the same hanger in his closet, something, as I recall, he does not do in the story.The soundtrack is worth listening to as well, particularly Willie Nelson's version of ""He Was A Friend of Mine.""We can only hope that the movie gets to a wide audience in Wal-Mart and K-Mart land, where these two men and their families lived."	5.0	But Will It Play In Falls Church, Virginia?	2005-12-18	35	26	9
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2DDTIDRR8BCW2	"H. G. Lin ""The Critic"""	"As someone who reads review more than writing them, it is very rare for me to want to write reviews at all. Even with a movie that I absolutely loved such as Broke Back Mountain, I really did not feel the motivation to write a review until after I see how many propaganda driven, lack of depth, shallow idiots wrote reviews for this movie, just so they can accomplish what politicians and church activist want ever since this movie received the recognitions and nominations they deserve.Broke back Mountain portrayed the universal truth about love, that ""Love Is Deepest When It Is Most Difficult."" The story starts off with two cowboy, both in desperate situations financially, both came from a less than perfect background. Then, they work in jobs without any support from their employers, and the only people that can comfort them is themselves. Anyone in this situation would fall in love, but their love extend way beyond that. Through the time they spend on Broke Back Mountain, characteristics that these two are destined lovers began to play out. For example, Jack's energetic spirit is the kind of energy needed to awake the comfort within Ennis, while Ennis's calm but firm spirit is the kind of caring nature Jack needs. They both share the same values, same thoughts, and if this were a girl-boy movie, as all the third rated movies Hollywood have made perhaps too much of due to an extraordinary writer and director as talented as Annie Proulx and Ang Lee, then it would be easy to see that these two are suppose to be lovers. But why should the situation be any different when it comes to Two Men? It isn't any different, and finally, on a cold night on Broke Back Mountain, the two started the love that was already meant to happen.Deep inside Jack and Ennis, and perhaps every viewer of Broke Back Mountain, there is a realization that Jack and Ennis are meant to be together, instead of going seperately to wives because of the propaganda they are surrounded with. Yet, that is exactly what broke Jack and Ennis apart: Propaganda. These men would have been extraordinary together, but the propaganda that men should be with women force them into separate lives, and when Jack wants to escape this Propaganda, he is killed. Ennis lived on his own from that point on, and carried on this love for the rest of his life.Now ask yourself, are you viewing the core of this movie? Or are you judging this movie by the surface which, due to the same propaganda that kept Jack and Ennis apart, is a love that is not suppose to happen. All of you who think very lowly of this movie did it because you claim that these men are not in love. Yet you would say that the other Hollywood flicks, which is filled with people who just have sex on each other when they meet, and dump each others the next day, is true love. Some of you even claimed that this book portrayed that gay life is miserable, and this movie is about two miserable men seeking each other for sexual release. You are right, these men are miserable, but how can they not be when people like you are pressuring propaganda on them? Stop and take the gender issue away for a moment. The qualities they show both themselves, and towards others, show a level of loving integrity that no other romance scenes from any other movie, gay or straight, has ever showed, and yet you refused to call it love. Let me ask you a question, if what they show is not love, then what is?If the displays of love and affection between these men do not come logical to you, it is because Ang Lee has to delete scenes from the original script so that narrow minded people like you won't be offended by it. If love between two men is the reason you don't like this movie, then perhaps it is time that you widen your horizon and be more accepting towards all forms of love, instead of expecting director Ang Lee to place a limit on love for you. If the misery you see is what displeases you, then let it be a lesson to you to create a more pleasant and accepting world for everyone so that these tragedies, which is still occurring in modern society, will never happen again. Finally, if you rated an movie that provokes new thoughts and emotions within the viewers, depths of understanding towards human nature, and a cry for a different way to live as 3 stars and below, then know that this is how you rate your integrity, as there is simply no reason to compromise true beauty towards your personal bias.Now let's look at this movie once again. Does this movie has a script that has depth, content, and provocative yet beautiful? Yes! Does this movie have a director that truly gets the inner beauty of the script, and enhances it while playing it out to the world? Yes! Does this movie has extraordinary actors and filmed with extraordinary theatrical skills? Yes! Does this movie that satisfied all criteria that define an once-in-a-lifetime, extraordinary movie, and even exceed all criteria and expectations and come out on top deserve an honor of the highest regard? Most definitely![...]"	5.0	Not a Movie For Shallow Idiots	2006-04-02	2	1	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	Historically the Golden Globe Awards have always tended to behave one step ahead in what moral codes or conventional scruples concern respect the Academy Awards. The film deals with a very special relationship widely commented around the world between two men.This delicate issue is handled with special care, without hurting sensibilities, the script nevertheless is built on non solid basis, making just emphasis on the surface of the things. I missed for instance the necessary dramatic density or nourishing flashbacks. There is an excessive employment of arresting visual landscapes and some well made violent dialogues. But the epilogue is so artificial in what dramatic expression that really disappoints as final corollary or deserved tribute. It's like you open the door but not entirely, leaving to see imperfectly certain diffuse and distorted images in a mirror.Just imagine what about this film in hands of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, but if I had to pronounce for an actual filmmaker, I would have suggested three names without special preference: Nagisa Oshima, Pedro Almodovar or Peter Greenaway.Special  acknowledgement to the arresting photography, artistic direction and splendid performances of the two main protagonists.	4.0	A visual Adagio!	2006-04-07	28	8	20

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A364VIQ3KLAWVX	H. M Pyles	It has been remarked that too many directors approach movies as filmed plays instead of as a primarily visual art, and they consequently over-rely on dialogue.  Ang Lee certainly addresses that criticism, virtually turning silence and taciturn gazes to the purpose usually served by dialogue.This movie tells (or rather paints) a compelling story of two young men who, by unexpectedly falling in love one summer in a remote mountain shepharding camp, suddenly find that their assumed paths in life will carry them farther and farther away from the path to which their natures call them.  One -- Jack Twiss -- is willing to find his way onto the right path, if he can just convince his lover, Ennis Del Mar, to join him.  Ennis, perhaps more appalled than Jack at what he finds himself to be -- and more fearful, due to a traumatic childhood experience -- refuses to become Jack's fellow traveller.  So they both settle into a years-long pattern of interludes stolen from their wives and families, with each tryst ending as yet another missed opportunity heaped on a growing pile of quiet despair.  And the despair is not their's alone, as in different ways it grows to encompass their families and destroy the lives they thought would be their screen and their distraction, if not their salvation, from their illicit love.It's a bleak story, painted bleakly.  Jack lives his straight life against the backdrop of a garish suburban house kept by a wife who never saw a hairdo she could resist.  Ennis lives his straight life in a dingy hovel over a laundromat, with a wife who, though deserving of his love and sympathy, is forcefed his own emotional deprivation.  The horizon only clears and the scenery only beguiles in the mountains to which Jack and Ennis escape for their sparse doses of love.It's a fine movie, beautifully crafted.  But I take one star away for the very reason that most critics laud it to the heavens:  the use by Heath Ledger of gazes, glowers, and distant stares in lieu of not just some, but almost all, dialogue.  I have a dog who manages to express herself reasonably well with looks and body language.  I know when she's hungry, frustrated, and about to pee on something.  But I really would know so much more about her if she could just say a few words every now and then.  (Please don't take this as a slam against Ledger's acting ability.  He's awfully good at gazes, glowers, and stares.  This is a director's choice, not an actor's.)This over-reliance on non-verbal expression created two flat spots in what would otherwise have been a 5-star movie for me.  The first was the scene in the tent when Jack and Ennis first made love.  Granted, it was supposed to have been spontaneous.  But few things -- especially the acquiescence of two adults in suddenly breaking through their deeply-rooted taboos -- are quite as spontaneous as here portrayed.  There had to be more going on by way of prelude than just the rollicking and wrestling in the grass and the excuses to spend the night at base camp . . . and dialogue might have held the clue to that missing something.The second was the tragic ending of the movie.  By that time, Ennis had withdrawn into such taciturnity that one can only observe his loss as an event, not feel it as the tearing out of his heart and soul that is presumably was.  A few well-scripted words would have helped rather than hindered the carrying of a dramatic load that was, in my opinion, simply too heavy for a few caught breaths and baleful strokings of empty clothes -- no matter how masterfully delivered.Well, enough of my verbosity.  I'm off to practice pinching my jaw expressively for the next movie review.	4.0	Say Something . . . Anything . . . Just Talk . . . Please	2006-01-10	31	14	17
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AC7S4JA7T6UEX	"hollymac ""holly"""	"I first saw the preview for Brokeback Mountain while I was in the theater for another movie. After viewing the trailer I felt as though the wind had been knocked out of me, I was so taken aback. Suddenly, I did not want to view the film I had come for but rather longed to see Brokeback. I had already read the short story by Annie Proulx several times and was excited to discover that it was  adapted to film.The movie was not released for a couple of months, and on its opening day in my town I was one of the first to purchase a ticket to the showing. It was at a small, independent theater; there weren't a lot of seats; the screen wasn't very large; the sound wasn't quite up to par. And yet, the experience of seeing this story come to life on the big screen was so overwhelming it is almost indescribable.Larry McMurtry, Diana Ossana, Ang Lee, the incredibly talented cast of actors - including Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger (who gave the performance of a lifetime) - all brought this short story to life in a brilliant way. It was not just the amazing acting, or the fact that the screenwriters could take thirty pages of plot and successfully turn it into a full-length feature film, it was also the breathtaking cinematography: I could almost feel the cool wind against my face, smell the rich dampness of the earth, taste the biting cold of the rushing river. The acting, the directing, the cinematography - all of these things, together with a beautiful original score by Gustavo Santoalalla, produced - what is in my opinion - one of the greatest films ever made.I have to admit that for days - even weeks - following the initial viewing of the film I was haunted by it. Images slammed in and out of my head like firecrackers, invoking sadness, beauty, emptiness and honesty - emotions on every level, emotions I had not felt for quite some time.I have now seen it several times and look forward to its release on DVD. My emotional attachment to this film and to Annie's beautifully succinct love story has not yet worn off. Perhaps we all have our own Brokeback Mountain - tucked away, deep down inside us. Perhaps we push our emotions so far down that nothing can ever penetrate the surface, nothing can really touch us until a movie, or a story, or a simple sunrise suddenly sparks a memory, a feeling. I guess this story has provided that for me. A realization that life hurts, even when you've worked hard to deny it.The media has so often tossed around the term ""gay cowboy movie"" when describing this film. In my opinion it belittles the point. This movie (and the story) embodies so much more than that. It is a stark look into the hollowness of our own existence, and what can happen when we deny ourselves truth. As Ennis so poignantly put it: ""If you can't fix it you've got to stand it.""I highly recommend this film to anyone who has the capacity to understand the human condition. And if you aren't one of those people, then perhaps this movie is the key to breaking down barriers and discovering truth and compassion. We all have it within ourselves to love - sometimes we just need a little nudge to bring it forward."	5.0	BEST PICTURE . . . no matter what they say!	2006-03-23	30	24	6

It looked like Ennis was seduced by Jackafter he was drunk. and he kinda felt he should have been heldresponsible to be Jack's good 'husband' so a strange ""fishingbuddies"" situation was maintained.

Still when I finished watching the movie the day after, I thought: ""Oscar-deserving!""3. It is a very sad - it can be a rather depressing - movie, because it is an adult and mature story. A movie for mature and grown-up people - and I don't know if I can be included among them yet in spite of all my age.4.The two cowboys got aware of the intensity of love ""after"", in the course of their lives, ""little by little""(!), but the love and passion had been there - an absolutely passionate connection indeed - all the time from the very beginning.5. By the way, there are two ""iceberg melting"" scenes: their meeting and hugging after years apart and when one is punching the other almost in despair (""where am I going without you?"").6. They did not try to runaway, to fantasize or ""to hide between girl's legs"": they simply had no option in the beginning due to their cultural background, inexperience and immaturiy; they had not the means of giving full expression to the best thing that happened in their lives - their mutual love.7. Anyway I must recognise I was very sad after I had seen the movie and spent the rest of the day very depressed.  I had to take Lorax twice.  I don't know when I will see it again yet.8.

What I saw was two already down-trodden and ill-fated Westerners unfortunately performing ""at"" the feelings that I never had to be ""Western"" for, that were as natural as rain to me, that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, both good actors, did not portray.  The emotions seem distant; the sex seems forced; the love seems eternal but ultimately unimportant, despite the final tears.  So...and this so is so great as to have made me ask, as I watched in the theater, and so what? ""Eternal"" to so many critics and unimportant in its outcome. So what do these presumed [...] gays with lassos feel?  A not-so-furtive kiss that gives the whole thing away? And one of such in 20 years?  Is love so kind?  Is love so real?  Maybe for some it should be.Well, those who may find my words antithetic, I have nonetheless purchased the DVD since I want to see it again; and probably again.  There is a sort of richness in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" a semblance of truth, a gesture of truth, or just a hope for truth, which (and I agree with another reviewer) two obviously bisexual gentlemen cannot fully reveal.  Those of us who have had to live 60 years of ""unexpression"" (our generation demanded it; and yours may too, some day), expressed in a thousand subtle yet sometimes extravagant ways, find this expression a bit unconvincing (even given the year in which it supposedly transpired)."	2.0	is love so offended?	2006-04-04	69	8	61
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ANYR2K39F5B3S	"Ileana Canetti ""Professor"""	"This is a very good movie and it is not definitively a ""gay cowboy movie"".  In some sense it is based in a kind of story that exists since ancient times: stories of men alone can be found in the Gospels, other biblical stories, and in Arthurian and Knights romances (where tragic or unfulfilled love is so common) so Ang Lee's depiction of a conventional theme is not so rare, in some sense America should feel proud that this Taiwanese humble man directed this beautiful story set in an All-American ambiance: the Rocky Mountains.Very slow at its first part (this is a very long movie like all epics as Gone With the Wind and others) to show the repeated and boring routine of the work of these two men turned into shepherds during the Summer; the movie presents a very good turn at its last part where the conflict explodes showing how the lives of many people (Ennis and Jack families) were affected.  Two scenes in closed atmospheres were superb: at a family house which I don't tell and in a trailer.  Acting was surprisingly good at this last part of the movie, specially by two female actors:  Linda Cardellini as the waitress and Kate Mara as Alma Jr. (age 19).As for Heath Ledger, what can I say?  He should had won the Oscar in the Best Actor Category for his portrayal of this quiet and disturbed childhood cowboy, amazing!"	4.0	An American Setting for the Universal Story of Love	2006-04-26	24	14	10
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A5ZJFVV0564T6	"Ilona Novotny ""Eccentric"""	"""Brokeback Mountain"", scripted by Larry McMurtry (""Lonesome Dove"") and Diana Ossana from E. Annie Proulx's short story, and directed by Ang Lee (""Sense and Sensibility""), has a lot of people talking.  The tale of two cowboys, the taciturn Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) who fall in love while working on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming in 1963, has just won several major Golden Globe Awards, has been banned in the State of Utah, and has people, straight and gay, talking...and thinking...a lot.When I first heard of the film's subject, I said ""Oh, not another film about gay people that ends in tragedy, haven't we progressed beyond that?"" Well, after seeing the film, I have to say ""Yes.....and no."" I, a gay man born in the mid-1950s in New York City, feel very fortunate to have not been a gay man in Riverton, Wyoming in 1963, tho I can still remember being ""fag baited"" in my teens, and was even physically attacked in the early 1980s, for ""being queer."" I, fortunately, survived. A lot of people who were born after the 1970s cannot imagine what it must have been like for gay people, especially for those who were not living in major cities, back in the 1960s and 1970s.Since I won't go too much into the film's storyline, what I will say what I admired was how the subject was handled. Since the story begins in Wyoming in 1963, where there was no such thing as an openly gay man, one has to place oneself in that time and place.  Men didn't show ""tenderness"" towards another man, because ""Real men don't do such things, unless they're queer"", and ""Real"" men got married and raised families. Women were expected to marry, have children, and look after their homes. Homosexuality was a subject that was whispered about, or derided as a sign of sexual perversion, or weakness, or mental illness. Period. ""Brokeback Mountain"" does not eroticize, nor sensationalize, nor exploit the activity between the two men. There is one (count it, one) scene, shot in semi-darkness, when ""the urge"" overtakes the two men and they begin to have ""rough"" sex (remember, ""real"" men have to be rough in Wyoming!), and that's that. No nudity, no revelling, it's over in seconds. Those expecting steamy ""Queer as Folk"" sex scenes will be disappointed, it's not to be found here. Keep reading.The acting in the film is, well, I forgot that I was watching actors! There is no grandstanding here, no showy histrionics. Heath Ledger's Ennis is so believable, I didn't know he is Australian! No goofy cowboy twang here. Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack is sensitive but not whiney, and Michelle William's Alma Del Mar and Anne Hathaway's  Lureen Twist are no brain-dead bimbos, they are women who married their men for love, and then must deal with the realization of their husbands' ""other life"" in the best way they can. Michelle Williams' ""suffer in silence"" performance, until she can longer be silent, and Anne Hathaway's Lureen, who remains tight-lipped and stoic, are believable, subtle performances. There are no villains and heroes in this tale, no devils or angels, just people. This is a true-to-life tragedy, where everyone suffers a loss. A loss of innocence, a loss of dreams.Visually, the film is a study in contrasts. The ""bigness"" and beauty of Brokeback Mountain, and the cramped, claustrohobic, often ugly, ""real world"" (dismal apartments, trailers, saloons) are an obvious leitmotif. Rodrigo Prieto's unglossy cinematography, very sharp, has its own stark beauty, and Gustavo Santaolalla's decidedly spare score, add to the simple and sensitive way this story is told. Director Ang Lee, I understand, did not ""fuss"" at his actors., nor does the film ""preach"" or fall into kitschy sentimentality, it walks a very fine line and does not falter. It takes a slightly detached (but not dispassionate) point of view, it depicts its situations and characters simply and directly, they ""are what they are"". The story plays itself, and the important theme that seems to be the crux of this film, is that people make decisions in life, be they good or bad, right or wrong, and what follows is.....? No one goes through life without heartbreak, it's unavoidable. We all make mistakes, we all make compromises, we all have regrets, we're only human. After being clobbered, bludgeoned, and oversaturated  with unbelievable scenarios, non-stop editing, deafening musical scores, endless special effects, this film is a welcome (altho some people may not like this, as it gives them time to think!) change for filmgoers. I was drawn into the story by the simple and beautiful imagery, the remarkably believable performances, the all-too-believable situations, and yes, I wept. I wept for everyone in the film. Here it is, 2 days after I've seen the film, and it's still on my mind. And that's good enough reason for me to write about it."	5.0	The Lonely Heart	2006-01-17	16	15	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1YM2NP17LX0J9	"Impi ""Rex"""	"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautiful, faithful, and moving film-adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story. The film conveys intact and true the overall mood and emotionally terse feeling of Proulx's literary work, even though not every scene nor all of the dialogue from the short story has been translated into the film verbatim (although a great majority of the dialogue and description has). This is understandable given the different natures of the two media. Inner psychological reflections and some physical descriptions in the written word can be difficult to portray on film cinematographically in photorealism, or may have been considered too graphic for such an artistic movie. If nothing else, this film is very tastefully done. To fully appreciate the film, one may wish to read and compare the short story, and view it at least two or three times to catch all of the subtleties, beginning from the very first scene.As one viewer's impressions, given that director Ang Lee is Chinese (Taiwan), he imbues throughout the entire film an ""Asian"" or ""Chinese"" aesthetic. For instance, there seems to be a particular framing of the landscape like in classical Chinese paintings, or incorporation of parallel and so-called ""bookending"" scenes, like Chinese rhyming couplets. As another ""Asian"" trait, may be a reticence to address controversial or sensitive matters too directly; hence, repression and the use of cultural allusions, subtle, nuanced facial and physical expressions or vocal inflections to convey unsaid or unsay-able thoughts or emotions. Even though unsaid or said indirectly, an observant viewer will understand completely the emotions and feelings that are being communicated.Often times when Jack and Ennis are together, every view of the moon is of a full moon, which not only signifies passage of time - usually only one full moon per month - but also in Chinese culture has connotations of wholeness and completeness. Thus, Jack and Ennis symbolically are two halves of a whole - yin and yang. The black and white hats, may actually reflect the yin and yang natures of Jack and Ennis, respectively. One can say that Jack is predominately ""psychologically feminine,"" while Ennis is ""psychologically masculine"".Yin and yang are descriptions of complementary opposites rather than absolutes. Most forces in nature can be broken down into their respective yin and yang states, and the two are usually in movement rather than held in absolute stasis. As in the traditional, circular yin-yang symbol, part of yin is also in yang, and part of yang is in yin, which is symbolized as a dot of each one in the other respectively. The dots in each serves as a reminder that there are always traces of one in the other. For example, there is always light within the dark (e.g., the stars at night); these qualities are never completely one or the other. Also, the dots serve as a reminder that absolute extreme on one part transforms instantly into the opposite, or that the labels yin and yang are conditioned by an observer's point of view. For example, the hardest stone can be easiest to break. This can show that absolute discrimination between the two is artificial."	5.0	Western Genre Masterpiece Full of Chinese Aesthetics	2006-08-17	36	31	5

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A244KQRR1N6KAT	Iron Jimmy	"I don't generally review movies because, frankly, I see too many of them.I did see this movie and feel that a review is warranted.Like many, many other people, I was turned off by the whole ""brokeback propaganda machine"".Let's be frank, here.1.  This is not a ""brave"" movie.  A gay movie in Hollywood is not a shocking thing.  This thing had ""oscar winner"" written all over it the moment somebody said, ""let's make overtly gay cowboys"".  Wanna see a ""brave"" movie in Hollywood?  Show me a movie about a nice, faithful man who is a good father and husband where religion is a large part of his life.I can name a lot of movies with gay themes.  I can't name many fundamentalist christian movies.  I'm neither gay nor a fundie.  I'm just calling it like I see it.2. This is not a low budget movie.  It had a production budget of $14 million and a cast of at least 5 relatively well-known actors and two who, even before the movie, were some of the hottest properties in Hollywood.3. I wasn't in that much of a hurry to see the movie.  I have nothing against gay people, but if you ask me what I want to see, it's almost always going to be a comedy.  There's enough sadness in the world already.  I want to be entertained, not depressed.  That doesn't make me a homophobe.  It just means that a gay cowboy movie isn't something that excites me.  Nor does a movie about a forbidden love story between two morbidly obese people.  I don't hate fat people, either.  Nor do I think anything about their ""love"" is bad in any way.  It's just not something I'm going to rush out and see.So, those were my three biggest objections to the movie:  it wasn't ""brave"", it wasn't a low-budget indie, and if people don't want to see it, that doesn't make them bad human beings.Yet, the buzz was all against that.  The way this movie was played up, you'd have thought it was the reincarnation of the Godfather Part II.  I've seen $200 million blockbusters that didn't get this much press.In the end, the box-office was respectable, but not at all amazing.  I think it ended up grossing about the same as that Kirsten Dunst Movie ""Bring It On"" about cheerleaders.So, the hype was a major, major turn-off.  The only thing this was missing was Brokeback soft-drink cups at Burger King.We rented the movie.  I have only one criticism of the movie:  Heath Leger mumbles.  Yeah, cinema verite and all that.  I know people mumble in real life.  For obvious reasons, I don't think I'm being unkind when I say that this is not a desireable thing in the movies.  I felt like I was watching Billy Bob Thorton in Slingblade half the time.Okay, all that having been said:  this was a very, very good movie.  I found it to be very well-made, very-well acted, very well written.  It is, in a nutshell, a great work of art.Movie of the year?  No.  Not nearly, and again, this is where the hype, I think, generated a lot of backlash.  It was great in its own way, accomplished everything it could have and did a great job.  However, I don't think it nearly met the standard of, say, Memoirs of a Geisha.  (Also a look into another world and a story of forbidden love, I might add.)This was meant to have an indie feel and it does.  In fact, the one thing that set the production apart from a true indie movie is that the acting was so good.I've heard people say they didn't like Ennis (Heath Leger's character.)  Duh!  So, because he's playing a twink, the guy needs to be likeable?  Who said there can't be unlikeable gay people?  Are we under some delusion that all gay people need to be cheery and fluffy?  I assure you that putting Richard Simmons in a cowboy hat would not have improved this movie.The movie did a good job of introducing Ennis as a young man with no real plans in life (like most young folks, frankly) and watching him evolve into a surly, angry, violent, selfish jerk.The undertone is that it's his frustration and repression that are making him a very, very disagreeable person.  Or maybe he's just an a-hole.  If he had been straight, maybe he would have been just as big of an a-hole.Who says the protagonists in a love-story have to be likeable at all?  Are jerks not allowed to fall in love?  Like the opening words to Anna Karenina:  ""happy families are all the same...""  They're boring, which is probably why so few movies are made about them.Unhappy families, we are told, are all unhappy in their own way.  This is the story of an unhappy family, or set of families.I think nearly everybody who saw the movie fell in absolute love with Michelle Williams.  Oh, that poor girl.  Makes us hate Ennis all the more, doesn't it?  That he has a salt of the earth woman and will screw her over?I was leery of any sort of ""gay agenda"" being pushed in the movie and frankly, there wasn't one.The fears that Leger had are real today, and were especially so in the past.  We know that a person can be killed simply for being gay.It's an ugly fact of polite society that if you drift outside of accepted norms, there are some people who are so stupid and narrow-minded that they will react with violence.  If you're gay, or atheist, or polygamist, or any other number of (what I consider to be) harmless persuasions in life, there are those who not only won't accept you, but will take it as their mission to end you.So, Ennis' fear is real, and the movie explains that he had a particularly horrific episode when he was 9 years old related to the concept of violence against gay people.  Maybe that's why he grew up to be such a jerk.  I would think that growing up knowing people would murder you if they found out who you were would be a heck of a thing to live with.Anyway, this was a very, very good movie and I enjoyed watching it.  Without the hype, I probably would have seen it sooner.A note about the soundtrack:  good lord, talk about over-rated.  A few minimalist, simplistic guitar riffs thrown in here and there.At the end, there's a SWELL of that same guitar riff and it's like the dumbest kid in the middle school's A/V club got control of the mixer.If this is a great soundtrack, then ""bear in the big blue house"" is the next best thing to Mozart.  I'm surprised the closing credits didn't have the cast singing ""goodbye, goodbye, good friends goodbye..."""	5.0	Brokeback Curious	2006-06-05	48	26	22
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1RVF43G6YKDTK	"Ismail Elshareef ""ielshareef"""	It' Summer 1963 in rural Wyoming. Two ranch hands, Ennis Del Mar (a very sexy and rugged Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (a remarkably vulnerable Jake Gyllenhaal) are looking for work when they get a gig as sheepherders on Brokeback Mountain.Ennis and Jack share hardworking days and lonely freezing nights, but most importantly, they both share a secret passion for each other that on one bitterly cold night reveals itself. They continue their summer working hard during the day and making love at night until one day Summer comes to an end and they go their separate ways.Four years later, they get connected again. Both are now married with children. Jack lives in Texas while Ennis remains in Wyoming. They are still in love and their yearning for each other is undeniable. However, their love affair is a burden as much as it is a bliss on both of them. They want to live out their love openly but societal laws forbidden it. They resort to frequent trysts but emotional needs cannot take it. They're between a rock a hard place and their only solace is their deep commitment and intense love for each other.The story of their love and how it unfolds is the story of the film, which is an absolute triumph for everyone involved in making it.I am very pleased, to say the least, to see two rugged, naturally masculine men romantically connected to each other in a major motion picture. Ennis and Jack's love story transcends gender and anatomy. It truly is a remarkable (and daring) achievement in American cinema!Ang Lee (Couching Tiger, Hidden Drago, director) did an outstanding job conveying the subtle yearning these two men had for each other. Of course, he had two very capable actors to deliver his vision, but yet it was his vision that really made this film a masterpiece. The performances were great, especially that of Heath Ledger, whom I believe should win an Academy Award for his role as Ennis. He stroke that precarious balance between detached and engulfed like no one ever could or ever will. A marvelous talent (and sexy looks to boot!)Brokeback Mountain, in my opinion, is a must-see for all. It's an R-rated film, so no kids allowed! This is a movie for everyone that's ever been in love with someone that for whatever reason couldn't have. It's also for everyone that knows or would like to know what true love truly is.Definitely one of the Best Films of 2005!	5.0	An American Triumph	2005-12-18	26	23	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A34M2BSL7CXEHT	"I. Sondel ""I. Sondel - lover of the arts"""	"""Brokeback Mountain"" finally arrived in Tallahassee on January 6.  Was it worth the wait?  Yes, it was.  The film, an adaptation of a story by Annie Proulx, is a thing of beauty.  Exceptionally faithful to the source material, Ang Lee, director or of the gay comedy ""The Wedding Banquet"" (among many other notable films), has fashioned a classic love story - one I feel sure will endure.  Why am I so confident?  Because rather than being groundbreaking, I found the story to be a simple variation on the classic formula which has fate conspiring against a pair of lovers.Is it really groundbreaking in 2006 for a film to depict the passionate love between two men?  The Fundamentalists are acting like this is our first time at the rodeo.  The truth is that we've been seeing films as explicit as this one for three decades.  In 1971 (thirty-five years ago!) staright actors Peter Finch and Murray Head played a passionate love scene in ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday.""  1982 saw Harry Hamlin and Michael Ontkean lock lips in ""Making Love.""  In 1985 Manuel Puig's ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and William Hurt won Best Actor as the film's openly gay protagonist.  In 1987 we saw the landmark Merchant/Ivory adaptation of E. M. Forster's ""Maurice,"" a love story that featured not only a happy ending, but James Wilby and Rupert Graves in a simulated sex scene which included full frontal nudity.  Has the Radical Right forgotten about the love scenes and nudity in ""Love! Valor! Compassion!,"" ""Angels in America,"" ""Wilde"" or the deservedly controversial ""Priest""?Over the past three decades there has been a virtual explosion of films dealing with gay people: ""Torch Song Trilogy,"" ""My Beautiful Launderette,"" ""Prick Up Your ears,"" ""Longtime Companion,"" ""Philadelphia"" (for which Tom Hanks won the Best Actor Oscar), ""Gods and Monsters,"" ""Jeffrey,"" ""High Art,"" ""Boys Don't Cry"" (for which Hilary Swank won the Best Actress Oscar), ""Before Night Falls,"" ""Far From Heaven,"" ""The Laramie Project,"" ""Capote,"" ""Breakfast on Pluto,"" ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""Transamerica,"" to name but a few.  Other gay inclusive Best Picture Oscar nominees have included: ""Midnight Cowboy"" (which won the award in 1969), ""Cabaret,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""The Crying Game,"" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""The Full Monty"" and ""The Hours.""There's an old show business adage that says ""any publicity is good publicity.""  Perhaps films like ""Brokeback Mountain"" would never achieve ""must see"" status without the Radical Right calling special attention to them, without which they would simply come and go with little or no fanfare.  Though I can't figure out why ""Brokeback Mountain"" should be considered either controversial or groundbreaking, I highly recommend it, and would love to see it win this year's Oscar for Best Picture.  Now THAT would be groundbreaking."	5.0	A great film, but not groundbreaking.	2006-01-18	4	2	2
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2Q8XID3R1CZ3Q	IVAN JIMENEZ CORREAL	After all the reviews written, I don't want to add anything else to the plot. So much has been said already. But I want to add a bit of controversy (perhaps) All the characters in the film apparently are doomed to failure and to unhappiness. But that's only apparent. Leaving aside the topic of social repression, constraint, conventionalities bonds, etc, which obviously made both Ennis and Jack cheat on their wives (They would never even have got married if they had had the chance to live their affection openly), the question is that, in my opinion, they had a margin, whatever small, of freedom to choose living a different life. That's the hardest reproach from Jack to Ennis the last time they are together. True, it is Ennis, the introverted type, uptight and taciturn, who never wants to take any risk, who's always full of confusion and fear. It is Ennis who gives up almost since the beginning, by accepting resignation and, therefore, failure, beforehand. Because things can always be fixed; and, if not, one can always fight and lose trying to fix them. Jack, on the other hand, is extroverted, vital, enthusiastic, idealistic and a dreamer. He may seem the weaker of both, but he's actually stronger than Ennis, because he knows what he wants and is willing to fight for it. Jack would have sacrificed anything to have a common life with Ennis, while Ennis is incapable of compromise. That's how I see it. Even if their destiny was meant to be comdemned to ostracism or to be killed by an homophobic gang, like in the traumatic vision of Ennis, even this end would have been better than being bound to live a miserable unhappy life, always shielded by lies, making miserable the people around them, bearing a broken marriage, provided that, even if their end had to be tragic, both Jack and Ennis would have shared a time of happiness living together. What was the use of living to save appearances? To lead a miserable life, as Ennis ends up completely alienated, probably regretting till the end of his life the wasted chances, the lost illusions. At least Jack Twist had the guts to fight for their happiness.	5.0	A beautiful film	2008-06-01	9	8	1

Aiello	"Well, it's the day after the Academy Awards and while I'll never begrudge Crash for winning Best Picture, especially since it was a very good film, it was Brokeback Mountain that truly spoke to me and resonated in a way that Crash didn't.Adapted from the short story by E. Annie Proulx, Brokeback Mountain tells the gut wrenching story of two young ranch hands who fall in love in the early 1960s.  Ang Lee maps out their relationship up to the early 80s and actors Heath Ledger and Jack Gyllenhaal who play Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist respectively, create fully formed characters each conflicted with demons, and each making different choices with equally devastating consequences.Debate around this movie swirls around the fact that it carries the ""sinister"" liberal agenda to finally demarginalize the gay lifestyle and bring it to the mainstream.  Brokeback Mountain, if you really look at it, is a statement about how you decide to live your life in the face of social strictures.  And it provides no uplifting answer.  If you try to live your life without apology like Jack, you run the risk of physical harm and if you choose to bottle it up like Ennis, you implode from the weight of your own longing.  And the film isn't just about Jack and Ennis, but how their relationship causes a ripple effect throughout the other people in their lives.Frankly, Brokeback Mountain is a movie whose time has come and it saddens me that Hollywood didn't fully capitalize on the zeitgeist by bestowing the film its best picture prize.  Even in the face of the Academy's snub, Brokeback Mountain still tells its powerful story.  It's beautifully shot, unfurls  very slowly but surely to its hearbreaking end and slightly optimistic coda.  Ultimately, by the end, the viewer will understand the cost of what it takes to be oneself in spite of the world, and sometimes in spite of oneself."	5.0	Brokeback Leaves You Brokenhearted	2006-03-06	59	53	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2FE4WC1Z2OM5T	Jack London	"As a professional movie critic, I have watched dozens of movies, and never has a movie stood out like Brokeback Mountain. I remember when a Christian activist called my office, and practically yelled at the top of his lungs over the phone because I commented a ""movie that promote a Gay lifestyle"" as the best movie in the 21st century. After watching couple more movies produced after Brokeback Mountain, including the best picture winner, Crash, I still stand by my statement.90% of movies today rely on actors/actresses pulling stunts on screens that distract viewers from the fact that the movie has no story line. Around 9% has directors that put dull themes into dramatic movies, as in the case of ""Hulk"" when the director is able to transform a simple comic book to a movie with emotion, drama, and ideas. Brokeback Mountain belongs to that unique 1% of the movies where a short story from one of the best authors the world ever witnessed is combined with the spirit of the director, and acted out by actors and actresses who, despite being pop performers and show off their athletic abilities and appearance on screen, is able to put aside all that distraction, and carry out the dram flawlessly. To me, this is what all movies should be like.I have no idea why this amazing film did not win the Best Picture of the Year. I suspect that the Oscar board probably received the phone call I received from various Christian groups. It's sad that, even in the 21st century, people are still propaganda driven, and close minded. But whatever controversy surrounds this movie, its very existence marked the beginning of a new journey for humanity.Thank you, Ms. Anne Proulx, Mr. Ang Lee, and the actors and actresses of Brokeback Mountain, for creating this masterpiece."	5.0	Best Writer, Director, and Actors/Actresses Combined!	2006-05-23	32	28	4

Each time I saw it, it seemed like the audience viewing it with me was totally different demographically from the times before.  This is my new all-time favorite film.  I respect the opinions of the people who say they hated it and that it was 2-1/4 hours of their lives wasted.  I respect that opinion; I just don't understand it.  The acting is great, the scenery is great and it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture.  I guess it's also a matter of personal opinion whose performance was better, Heath's or Jake's.  From a technical standpoint, Heath Ledger nailed the role of his career.  Ennis Del Mar was a more nuanced character and had several more shades of grey than that of Jack Twist.  However, Jake Gyllenhaal's talent can't be denied and I think in some ways I was able to embrace his character much more easily than Heath's.	5.0	New All-Time Favorite Film	2006-05-13	23	18	5

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	What a tragic drama occurred in this year 1963, when a diabolical machination managed to assassinate the President who could have opened a door and let us go through it. Imagine 1968 with Kennedy in the White House and his brother running for the election with Martin Luther King as vice-president. Ang Lee decides to show this phenomenal frustration by caressing us in teh wrong place and the wrong way, by breathing some freezing air in our neck. Two virile cowboys, who look after sheep mind you, fall in love in the solitude of these high mountains in Wyoming. What can happen ? The whole world crashes down into illusions and appearances, false sentiments that are nothing but a thin veil hiding, as well as possible, the depth that is totally forbidden and repressed and frustrated and negated lest the guardians of morality and normality decide to clean up that plate of the trash such feelings represent in their apocalyptically square vision. And the tragedy swells and waxes and explodes. Unhappiness is the result and men and women see their souls buried as deep as hell into the egostic selfishness of running after the sole satisfaction of material needs that bring no spiritual satisfaction, no pleasure of the mind, no dream of the soul, just a fattening accumulation of cholesterol and depthless enjoyment of evanescent virtual images on a TV screen. And the films finds its closure in death, death of one of those partners, and total alcoholic oblivion for the other one who satisfies himself with a tumbler of whisky to celebrate the coming wedding of one of his daughters. Pathetic regression into playing the role other people expect you to play.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1IPTW726RJNWG	"Jake Del Mar ""Jake Del Mar"""	I live in Malaysia not America. Although never been to the land of plenty myself, the cowboy/western 'subculture' has always been part of western entertainment fed to us on TV/movies. And the prevalent of wearing Levis, Wrangler jeans amongst us always been associated as the 'cowboy pants'. Cowboys are the embodiment of machoism, and Marlboro ciggarettes are the most consumed import what more with the sharp featured cowboys higlighted in the ads.The first time I watched the trailer I thought that it is going to be heartbreaking.Tru enough I was right, but i did not expect it to be affecting me emotionally for days which I am still recovering. I never thought a MOVIE could break my heart just like my first love did. I never thought Brokeback Mountain could open up old wound and leave it bleeding for days again. But it did. No movie had ever done that. I can't imagine any movie that could do this again.I was searching everything and anything about brokeback mountain like searching for a lost love. I was secretly wishing that Jake will come alive again for a sequel....yes...i had gone insane after watching this movie. I was in a mess, I couldnt do anything right. I couldnt figure out whether it was the fictional Ennis del mar that I fell in love with or Heath Ledger himself. I can't figure out how to describe this visceral, surreal, ethereal feeling. I have watched plenty of great movies  that moved me (recently the gay movie from Quebec C.R.A.Z.Y which almost recounted my early days living in suburbia) but Brokeback Mountain is different and totally a different league in its own. It didnt just move me...it pushed me off the orbit.I may be describing how this movie affected me rather than the movie itself. But that could go on for pages.In a way I am quite delighted to know that a movie have shown that what I've experienced in my life is not unusual...that all the mess I had to endure previously, someone shared. And all the response it received from men and women all over the world reiterating this fact.But I am deeply sad too of the content of this movie for it just lingers in my head with a question if I will grow old, bitter and lonely in this land traditional Asia....that can never except a man who loves another. It's simply a sad fact, that while Ennis had to endure the heartbreak moments only until the 130th minute ended in the cinema, I am thinking that I will have to endure this my whole life.Thank you all for reading.	5.0	Heartbreaking Mountain in Asia	2006-02-05	24	18	6

The scenery in this movie is beautiful (filmed right here in Alberta). The movie is an emotional journey of two men who work together one summer herding sheep, and ultimately fall in love. They go on to live seperate lives and get married and have kids, but always come back to each other every year when they'd go to Brokeback Mountain.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7	James Carragher	"What's left to say?  There's no need to recount the plot line; it's by now almost as well known as that from the other great love story of the season, King Kong.  There's also no need to rave about Ang Lee's talent or taste; that was clear well before Brokeback ever came along.  But here's three things I can say:  first, this is not a gay movie.  It is a memorable, life-long, and very sad love story of two people who just happen to both be boys and then men.  Second, appreciation for Heath Ledger's work in portraying Ennis, the more conflicted of the two, only grows when one leaves the theater.  In every move he makes on screen, he gets the personal cost to Ennis of living with what cannot be -- as he says at one point -- ""fixed"" exactly right.  Even Jack, with his own conflicts, does not understand that cost, but thanks to Ledger's acting, the audience can.  Third, in a movie filled with affecting scenes, I'm not sure there is a more powerful one than the last, when Ennis folds up the left-behind sweater of his daughter, the other great love of his life and the consolation for not having made his life with Jack, and places it on his closet shelf near their bloodied, twinned shirts from the summer on Brokeback Mountain."	5.0	All It's Cracked Up to Be and More	2005-12-18	25	22	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1O4CAN7QG87BC	James C. Tatman	In many ways, this is a great film, and Heath Ledger's performance is certainly worth the price of admission, as well as an Oscar.  Its understated brilliance and his portrayal of his character as a man torn between two lives, mostly evoked through subtle action, laconic speech, and a physical disconnect from his circumstances, save for the flashes of violent love and too few tender moments, never dares stray into a world he really doesn't know, and therein lies its success as a performance but also the failure of the film.  I was expecting the movie to be a crushing emotional experience, but the audience, including myself, never started weeping until the last ten minutes, when Ennis goes to Jack's boyhood room and finds the bloddy shirt.  He clutches it and smells it and only then do we understand the depth of his feeling for the other man.  The weathered boards of the wall in that room are the weathered remnants of his love and the emptiness of Ennis's world as the desolate view through the window there is the last frame of the film and testimony to the artist's vision of its director, Ang Lee.The problem with the movie, however, is ultimately that it is a film made by heterosexual people about a homosexual experience, and that is where the emotional disappointment occurs for me.  Having lived that same torment, I never felt the strangling and overwhelming inner pain that such an impossible love causes in either Ennis or Jack.  Perhaps the Michelle Williams character best evoked that struggle, but she too seemed somewhat detached from the reality of emotional distress.Nevertheless, it is still a beautiful and heart-wrenching movie that I would recommend to anyone, either straight or gay.  It has beautiful scenery and a score that is appropriate in its simplicity and repetitiveness, and the performance by Heath Ledger shows him as an actor of great sensitivity, promise, and skill.I look forward to the release of the DVD so that I can see it again.  I expect I will like it more the second time.	4.0	"""Brokeback Mountain"" - An Emotional Disappointment"	2006-01-18	12	4	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2UONLYIFN6ZS3	"James G ""J.M.G."""	Brokeback Mountain has received a considerable amount of attention from the media for it's incredible story and visual detail, as well as its controversial story line. Brokeback challenges the very nature of a western romantic film, and although it is not a typical love story it will be upheld as a landmark film for both the GLBT community as well as American cinema.Brokeback is the story of two men who fall in love while herding sheep in the fictional wilderness of Brokeback Mountain. At first, I was a little skeptical that the movie was going to be good at all since the relationship between the two men develops rapidly just within the first half of the film. However, the story is much more than just about the two men. The movie explores the societal pressures of marriage and heterosexuality as both men marry women and have children. The movie also acknowledges the fear and anxiety of same sex intimacy as the character played by Heath Ledger (Ennis) is afraid of committing to a relationship because of a past childhood experience when he saw a murdered man who was suspected of being gay.SPOILER: Although the movie is quite beautiful, it is also an incredibly sad film. The character played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack) is murdered at the end of the film. Ennis is left to deal with his emotions of loss as well as never committing to a fulfilling relationship with Jack. Secondly, you feel incredibly sorry for the wives and the children as they become aware of their father's infidelity that end up destroying their families. Heath Ledger's recent death adds an extra sting at the end of the film.If the content of two men falling in love is of no interest to you, the incredibly beautiful scenery and soundtrack are worth it alone. I would advise ignoring the homophobic comments and reviews left by the Christian right who have no appreciation for art and progression. Approach this film with an open mind, and you will not be disappointed. Leave the prejudices at the door, sit back, and enjoy the show! Oh, don't forget the Kleenex.	5.0	A beautiful and yet tragic love story	2009-06-21	9	8	1

Unfortunately, THAT would make this movie a fairy tale, since the world has not developed to that point of tolerance yet, and certainly not when and where the movie takes place.Nevertheless, Brokeback Mountain is a breakthrough for humanity, and I pay my salute to the actors and makers of this movie, for making this movie possible.	5.0	Brokeback Mountain, I Solute You	2006-05-30	28	23	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AQ01Q3070LT29	James McDonald	"Widecreen. Rated ""R"". Running time: 2 hrs, 14 min.Note: You will need to turn on your English subtitles for this one because some of the important dialogue can not be heard during important scenes.  This film has Spanish subtitles too at your option.Why did I wait unti 2007 to see this film? Too embarassed to rent in public with all the controversy about it.I knew Ang Lee from his directing work on ""The Hulk"" and the stars of the film, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal I may have seen in a movie or two in the past, but could not place the face with the name until this film came out. I didn't even know the proper name of this film. I kept calling it ""Broken Mountain"".This story begins in Signal, Wyoming 1963.  Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet each other as the only two men that show up for a sheep-herding job. The two work on Brokeback Mountain together herding sheep from point A to point B. As two weeks go by, they share their life about each other and how they came to this point in their life. A friendship develops and becomes somewhat deeper.The job ends in August because of a storm. Jack mentions he might come back next summer.Ennis gets married in November to Alma. Because of work, their personal lives and living in different states, Jack and Ennis could not travel to see each other then.Ennis is getting frustrated by his wife and two kids. After four years, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack. He is driving all the way down to see Ennis. When they meet up, it's an emotional one. They hug tightly and kiss each other.For Ennis, he has been alone most of his life. He keeps himself inside, however Jack was able to open him and Ennis not happy with his married life, really missed Jack. Ennis didn't let those feelings out until he saw Jack again. Jack needs him too.Can this special friendship continue dispite the changes in their personal lives? Jack tries very hard.The Cinematography is beautiful and well done. The Original Score heart-tugging. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did incredible acting with Ledger's character having pinned up emotions so raw.Heath Ledger and his co-star Michelle Williams met on the set of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and became engaged in real-life. Jake Gyllenhaal is godfather to their daughter. (Heath and Michelle separated in 2007. He was always with his daughter).Larry McMurthy (The Last Picture Show 1971, Texasville 1990) along with Diana Ossana wrote the screenplay based upon a short story by Anne Proulx.Brokeback Mountain (2005) won the Academy Award for Best Director--Ang Lee, Best Screenplay (Adapted), Original Score--Gustavo Santaolalla.Also nominated for Best Actor--Heath Ledger, Best Supporting Actor--Jake Gyllenhaal, Best Supporting Actress-Michelle Williams,Best Cinematography.The 78th Academy Awards, March 5, 2006, paid homage to Brokeback Mountain (2005) by showing a montage of clips from other western cowboy movies with interesting ""buddie"" scenes.This single disc DVD has no audio commentary, no deleted scenes, 3 featurettes, option of English, French. Option of subtitles: English, Spanish, French.SPOILER:I really hated the ending act of this film. It was almost a break-through film, but just as it's about to give you an emotional pay-off, it cuts you cold.Why is Hollywood so afraid of making a male friendship movie with a happy ending?A very diffucult film for both actors to do, but they both gave outstanding performances.Update: Heath Ledger died January 22, 2008, from an accidental overdose Acute intoxication, combined effects of painkillers, sleeping pills, anti-anxiety medication and other prescription drugs. He was 28. Heath had said he was not sleeping well, 2 or 3 hours only, because he was distraught about his role as the ""Joker"" in the new Batman movie, THE DARK KNIGHT (2008). He had a hard time getting out of the character. he also was separated from Michelle Williams and missed his daughter.His housekeeper found him naked laying face down at the foot of his bed. She came in to tell him his masseur had arrived.He will be missed! Rest in peace, Heath.While The Dark Knight (2008) was already completed, he was filming The Imagination of Doctor Parnassus (2009). Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Ferrell will continue his changing character in the film.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE GAY TO ENJOY A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY BETWEEN TWO MALES. I, MYSELF FELL IN LOVE WITH ENIS AND JACK AS I WATCHED THIS MOVIE. TWO MEN, NOT WELL OFF BY ANY MEANS GO IN SEARCH OF A MUCH NEEDED JOB TENDING A HERD OF SHEEP ON BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. WHILE ON BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN THEY DISCOVER THERE IS AN ATTRACTION DEVELOPING BETWEEN THEM. ENIS IS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED AND HAS NO INTENTION OF HAVING A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH JACK. THAT NOTION DISAPPEARED AFTER SPENDING ONE NIGHT INSIDE THE TENT WITH JACK. IT WAS JACK WHO INITIATED THE EPISODE, BUT AS TME MOVED ON YOU COULD TELL ENIS HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH JACK. AS A CHILD ENIS WAS TAKEN BY HIS FATHER TO SEE A DEAD MAN LYING IN A GULCH. HIS FATHER DIDN'T COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT BUT STRONLY HINTED THE REASON HE WAS KILLED WAS BECAUSE HE WAS QUEER. ENIS FELT IF HE AND JACK DID GO OFF AND BUY A SPREAD TOGETHER THEY WOULD BE ALSO END UP DEAD. ENIS MARRIED ALMA AND HAD TWO CHILDREN WHOM HE ADORED, BUT STILL LOOKED FORWARD TO JACK'S RARE VISITS. HE LIED TO ALMA SAYING THEY WERE GOING FISHING. JACK WAITED FOR AWHILE BEFORE HE MARRIED. HIS WIFE CAME FROM MONEY SO ON ONE OF HIS VISITS WITH ENIS HE ASKED ENIS AGAIN ABOUT GOING AWAY SOMEWHERE AND BUYING THEMSELVES A RANCH. THE FEAR INSTILLED IN ENIS CAUSED HIM TO REFUSE YET ONCE AGAIN. ENIS AND ALMA DEVORICED. JACK WAS SURE ENIS WOULD GO AWAY WITH HIM AFTER THAT BUT ENIS GAVE THE EXCUSE OF CHILD SUPPORT AS A WAY OF SAYING NO. THEY HAD AN ON GOING LOVE AFFAIR FOR TWENTY YEARS. AT TIMES THEY BECAME EDGY WITH EACH OTHER. JACK BECAUSE ENIS WOULDN'T COMMIT TOTALLY TO BEING WITH HIM AND ENIS BECAUSE HE KNEW JACK WAS SEEING OTHER MEN EVEN SLIPPING INTO MEXICO FOR SEX. I FORGOT TO MENTION, WHEN THEY WERE ON BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN TENDING THE SHEEP ENIS FOUND HE WAS MISSING A SHIRT. IT WAS THE ONE THAT HE WAS WEARING WHEN HE AND JACK GOT INTO A FIST FIGHT. JACK SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AS IF TO SAY I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS. THAT SHIRT HAS A MEANINGFUL PART TO THE END OF THIS LOVE STORY. THE SCENES INVOVING ENIS & JACK'S SHIRTS WILL TEAR YOUR HEART OUT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN TO EVERYONE. IT'S A SHAME IT WASN'T ALLOWED IN MORE THEATERS. WE HAD TO TRAVEL 60 MILES TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT WASN'T BEING SHOWN ANYWHERE CLOSER. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAD WITH THE MOVIE WAS A COUPLE TIMES I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND LEDGER(ENIS). HE EXPLAINED HE HAD TO TAKE SPEECH LESSONS BECAUSE OF HIS ACCENT. ALL IN ALL I GAVE BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN THUMBS UP AND FIVE STARS FOR A GIVING THE PUBLIC A CHANCE TO ENJOY A WARM, LOVING, HEARTFELT MOVIE WHICH I BELIEVE IN TIME WILL BE HELD UP AS A CLASSIC. IF UNABLE TO GO TO THE THEATER BE SURE TO BUY THE DVD. YOU WON'T BE SORRY.	5.0	A MOVIE  DESTINED TO BECOME A CLASSIC .	2006-03-02	29	20	9
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AIVY7XC1HRIN7	Jan R. Schulman	"The review by J. E. Barnes basically says all that I could hope to say about this movie and book.  I bought the book and the screenplay and cannot keep from reading both over and over and will buy the DVD the minute it comes out.  This movie has gotten under my skin and I find myself walking around grieving for these two men and their lost love and suffering.  I believe Heath Ledger did a magnificent job, but I think Jake Gyllenhal (sp?) did just as fine a job as Jack,  a personality so different from Ennis. I could feel their love and desperation and when they first see each other again after four years, I thought I would almost faint from the emotional upheaval of it all.  I think of Jack's comment, ""Sometimes I miss you so bad I can hardly stand it."" and I could feel what he was saying when he said it.  Anyone who has ever deeply loved, whether it be a lover or a child,  and been separated from that deep love for any period of time knows what kind of true heart pain you feel.  And this movie is about deep deep love which cannot be fully expressed at the time.  It doesn't matter who they are, except that these characters are so fully drawn and presented that you know them --- it's the fact that their love is so present on the screen that you feel it piercing your heart.  I'm not even sure why I am so drawn to this book and movie (I am a hetero female - married with children, etc.), except that it is so much about deep love and it is rare to see anything these days except for those flighty little ""chick flicks"" that are cute but meaningless.  This is anything but meaningless.  When my husband and I walked into the movie, a woman walking out said, ""Good Luck.  I hope you have a lot of kleenex.""  But I was numb when I walked out.  I was just completely overcome, even though I had read the book first and knew what it was and what was coming.  I had fallen in love with Ennis and Jack and just wanted to take care of them and ease their pain.  (Of course it didn't hurt that they are both gorgeous...) Just go with an open mind and an open heart and let it reach you."	5.0	Broke my heart...	2006-02-10	39	31	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A4AR1QP2OSDCH	"Jason P. Ruel ""Gay Lesbian Editor - Bellaonli..."	Crash.  A word will live in the hearts and minds of the American and International community that watched this years Academy Awards.  Our community, and others, was hoping to hear something else read when the award for Best Picture was made.  Instead of hearing Brokeback Mountain, we heard a loud and resounding CRASH.  Since the announcement, there has been a lot of debate over the merits of each film.  The proponents of each film are stating their cases, each trying to win over the hearts of the opponent.  But why the backlash?  Why all the drama?  Let us look.Brokeback has been called many things this year.  It has been heralded as the gay community's acceptance in the mainstream community.  It has been heralded as the bridge that will span the gap between the hetero and homo worlds.  It has been called many things and most of them positive... well in our community and a select set of heterosexuals.We have read numerous articles and opinions of people who are self-identified heterosexuals who have called the movie wonderful, uplifting and a new and fresh look into the struggles and life of closeted gay men.  It is a look into a gay community that we do not normally hear about.  The world of the cowboy, gay cowboy, which is never seen nor talked about.  However, was this move a true depiction of this community?More than twenty years after the founding of the Gay Rodeo, is this movie a real portrayal of those men?  Some say yes, while others say no.  They say that seeing this on screen is nothing new to them, and that many of them even struggle to find themselves in the movie, for it is no longer representative of their lives.  They say a lot has changed since the Jack and Ennis years (the movie covered the lives of these men from 1960's to the 80's).  For most Americans this movie represents all their preconceived notions of what being gay is.  We wreck homes.  We are all about sex.  We cannot fight the desires of lust and sin, and instead act on it while breaking up the American Family.  They see the way Jack and Ennis marry and have kids, yet still hook-up for sex every so often.  They do not see the inner struggle.  The turmoil the characters go through while coming to terms with whom they are and whom they love.  They do not see the love that exudes in this movie.  Simply put, they could not move beyond the blinders that they have been taught to wear all their lives.So was America ready for this film to win Best picture. Unfortunately NO!  Nevertheless, one good thing that will become of this is that more Americans will go to see the film.  The buzz behind the loss will fuel the need and want to see the film everyone was cheering on and lost. You know what they say...  the underdog tends to win.  In the end, while Brokeback lost to Crash, I think Brokeback will win.

This is the unexpected story of lonely people in search of a special dream. What is not expected is that they are American cowboys and are gay. Touching off a firestorm of controversy, this film is the first of what many believe will be the next barrier in the long history of prejudicial cinema. Years ago, Europeans ventured into this forbidden niche and established a precedent which up until now, American film companies have been reluctant to address. With the incredible talents of Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist the US has not only responded and shattered conventional wisdom, but offers perhaps the finest film of it's genre. Brokeback mountain is a story of two men searching for companionship and love. Unexpectedly thrown together by their search for employment, the two reluctantly accept ranching duties in the high Alpine mountains of Montana. There amid a vast wilderness, tending sheep and reflecting on their dreary lives, Ennis and Jack accept their solitude and quickly learn they are drawn to each other. Never-the-less, their conventional world defies, tugs and tears at their burgeoning affection for one another. Both men feel passionately, yet realize their forbidden affair could easily rip apart their facade of masculinity. Eventually, over a period of twenty years, they learn to deal with friends, families, and social pressures as their secret begins to evaporate. Emotionally charged and deeply touching in every respect, the film presents audiences with a portrait of fading Americana, amid changing seasons. All in all, a courageous attempt to mirror the life and loves of a reclusive aspect of the American cowboy. ****	5.0	A Mountain of Memories	2006-04-07	21	15	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A36SNWGAEFUO2H	Jason V	"I have now seen Brokeback twice. The first time I went home not knowing what I thought. I went in expecting a nice love story, and it really isn't nice at all. It shows how awful it was (and in some places still is) to be gay in America. I guess I was sort of mad that they we not happy, and then missed some details in the movie. After seeing it for a second time, I picked up a lot of details and ended up loving the movie. People complain about the ""love"" scene, and I did at first, but they were just trying to make it realistic. While I personally don't think more than 1% of gay guys jump into sex quite that quick, or in that way, they do do ""that.""I have talked to LOTS of people who have seen the movie, and while it was not everyone's favorite movie of the year, everyone has liked it.See it before you judge it, and I think chances are you wont feel cheated out of your money."	5.0	Good movie if you pay attention.	2006-01-17	5	2	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3KDWC5TDFQDZ0	Jau Chwen Chan	"I think the world has to thank Ang Lee for making this masterpiece and for being brave enough to pick up a script that was being dubbed as ""that gay cowboy movie"".The movie, as I'm sure many have heard numerous times, is a wonderful version of the Annie Proulx short story and really does capture the essence of it and in some parts, extends the story a little bit more.The story of Jack and Ennis (and we cannot forget their unfortunate wives) is one that I can imagine rings true in a lot of closeted gay men.  Today's society is still fairly intolerant and homosexuals are often misunderstood, stereotyped and judged just because of their sexual preference.  Living in Malaysia (where this movie was banned), it is even more apparent how underground being gay is.Beautfully made with sweeping cinematography (Ang Lee style) of Wyoming country, this movie is touching, heartbreaking and delicately made.  Through the amazing performances by all the actors, especially Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, the sensitivity of the subjects is subtley dealt with.  Some people I know have criticised the movie for being too slow and too contrived, but in my honest opinion, the pace of the movie was necessary to stir up emotions.  As for the movie being contrived, it is not the fault of the story that it makes people feel something.All in all, highly recommended and should be viewed in full without any pre-judgement before opinions can be made."	5.0	Mindblowing	2006-05-08	41	33	8

It wasn't to much talking but you seen the love growing between the two charaters. They had so much passion for each other that they couldn't express out in the open. These two men went on for years with out seeing and being without each other but as soon as they see each other again all the feelings they once had for each other all came back and started to take control of there lives.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AEVC9QXV6SOQY	"Jay Stevens ""osiris"""	"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a story of real people, in a real place, and at a real time. Having grown up in the rural west, and having a father who was a real cowboy, this movie took me back in time.  I thought the movie acturately portrayed life in the rural west among poor folks--something I grew up knowing about.The acting is outstanding, especially the portrayal of Ennis by Heath Ledger.  His character was so authentic it was uncanny.  Heath Ledger reminded me so much of the men that I grew up around.  He was taciturn, but at the same time, communicated a lot of information with a few words. He also mastered a form of speech that I remember.  He spoke without moving his lips. That was so characteristic of the cowboys in the rural west at that time, and probably still is.  His emotion was so real when he learned of Jack's death.  One could see all of the frustration of hiding his love and affection for all of those years.  Ledger conveyed that pain in a spectacular way with just an expression.This is a story of hundreds of men who grew up in that time and that place and in the same situation of Ennis and Jack.  I have met and talked to many of those men.  I think the strength of this movie is in the universal human emotions that are so brilliantly captured."	5.0	The Best Movie of the Year!	2006-01-21	30	26	4
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A19T9YVZXNSCZQ	"Jazz Pianist ""jazzwriter1"""	"One of the most moving and grace-filled works I've ever experienced in all the arts, this film is an astonishing masterpiece of beauty, truth and heartbreak. About love found, love lost, love endured, about how men-gay men are in reality and about how they do and don't deal with their feelings. In selfless performances of extraordinary depth, Heath Ledger's Ennis solidly anchors the film, while Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack illuminates it, with immense feeling and sensitivity. These men found a real home in each other, and their tenderness and mutual feeling, both expressed and unexpressed, is heart-rending in it's beauty.Brokeback Mountain, to me, calls to mind the some of Kahlil Gibran's words about love:""When love beckons to you, follow him,Though his ways are hard and steep.And when his wings enfold you yield to him,Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.And when he speaks to you believe in him,Though his voice may shatter your dreamsas the north wind lays waste the garden.For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.Even as he is for your growth so he is for your pruning.Even as he ascends to your height and caressesyour tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,So shall he descend to your roots and shake themin their clinging to the earth.Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.He threshes you to make you naked.He sifts you to free you from your husks.He grinds you to whiteness.He kneads you until you are pliant;And then he assigns you to his sacred fire,that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.All these things shall love do unto youthat you may know the secrets of your heart,and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart.But if in your fear you would seek onlylove's peace and love's pleasure,Then it is better for you that you cover your nakednessand pass out of love's threshing floor,Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh,but not all of your laughter, and weep,but not all of your tears.Love gives naught but itselfand takes naught but from itself.Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;For love is sufficient unto love.When you love you should not say,""God is in my heart,"" but rather""I am in the heart of God.""And think not that you can direct the course of love,for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.But if you love and must needs have desires,let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brookthat sings it's melody to the night.To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully.To wake at dawn with a winged heartand give thanks for another day of loving;To rest an the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;To return home at eventide with gratitude;And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heartand a song of praise upon your lips."	5.0	One for the Ages	2006-03-05	29	17	12

Its sovisual and beautiful, the directing, acting, music, cinematography, pace, all flow together to create magic.The short story by annie proulx and the adapted screenplayby Diana obssana and larry mcmurtry is fine tuned, slowly paced sothat director ang lee finds all the space he needs to tellthis tragic love story.  I just got blown away by all the many heartbreaking performances, thats why I go to the movies tosee acting, this is a drama not an action flic, you don't see acting this good in a movie by its entire cast.  ang lee did a fantastic job with each actor, they gave their best, heathledger,  Jake gyllenhaal, michelle williams & ann hathaway.A movie with such depth about a subject that still seemsto bring out the best and worst in americans.  Its sad toread so many hateful reviews, many by people who haven't even gone to see it.  Even sadder is to watch the wayits being made fun of, but it's the overwelming postivereception this movie has acheived that can never betaken away.  It may have lost the oscar to ""Crash"" for bestpicture but all those reasons aside,its  a movie that will live a long time and in the heartsof people for years to come.

Had you actually read this review or the one I'd previously written that mysteriously disapeared, you'd know that I'm not a bigot at all, anything but a bigot, I'm seeing through all the typical Hollywood stereotypes found in this movie, if everyone else did the same, there would be no such thing as ""Brokeback Mountain"".  I repect your opinion, to bad you can't respect mine.  Now that we're done with that, this movie sucks I only gave it 5 stars so you might actually read my review rather than ignore it.  This is my second review, because my first differed a little from popular opinion (not obscene or belittling, just not ""5 stars"", ""Best Movie Ever!!"")was magically erased...hooray for freedom of speech.  First off, why would anyone care what a straight asian man knows about gay cowboys, do you really think he knows what he's talking about?  Now let me start out by saying that I'm very open minded, I'm a straight, liberal, married man, I have many friends that are gay, and I think the gay public deserve all the same rights as any other race, religion, or creed.  Homosexual's are people just like anyone else, and whether they choose(I don't believe it's a choice)to be gay or not they are people who deserve to live a normal life just the same as you and me.  Now, let's get back to the movie, Brokeback Mountain is the most god awful disrespectful film, I think I've ever seen, but not for the reasons you might think. Ang Lee once again get's everything absolutely wrong(How you gonna make ""The Hulk"" into a drama?)and doesn't get one thing right.  The only people enjoying this film are people who've never or would ever have or had anything to do with a homosexual.  The homosexual public especially should be outraged by this film.  The film has such an unrealistic premise, it makes it to silly to even try to believe in these characters.  As far as this being a great love story, give me a break, if this were a story about a man and a woman no one would care but because it's involving a gay couple suddenly it's ""The Greatest Love Story Of All Time!!!""  Give me a break, these men ignore their children and cheat on their wives, this is not a touching story.  Now you'll say ""but this took place during a time where people couldn't be open about who they were"".  Well whatever, I could still care less.  As far as the romance is concerned, if you like drunken sodomy(that's how all homosexual relationships start right), you'll love this movie.  Just one night in a tent next to a guy who's given you no prior hints that he might be gay, you(Of course not being gay yourself) roll over in the middle of the night and accidentally, violently, & analy rape each other.  That's where homosexual relationships come from according to Ang Lee.  It doesn't come from genuine love or sharing feelings with your partner, no just's Drunk BFing; and that's not offensive is it?  This movie was made by homophobes for homophobes period.  Besides this being as offensive as it is, it's extreeeemmmeeeellyy ssssslllllloooooowwwwwwww, and under Lee's direction gives you no reason to sit through the movie other than ""does this movie get better?"" questioning in your head.  Ya, maybe there is some nice pictures of the mountains, but is that really any reason to sit through this god awfully  offensively slow snooze-a-thon?  This movie is pure hype designed for me and you to sit and talk about how either good or bad it is so that around Oscar time it'll win it's awards.  2 years from now you won't hear a thing about it, and I hope to god it doesn't win any awards, that'll only cement the fact that the Oscars are even more meaningless(Gladiator was good but c'mon?)than I had already thought.  Everything about this movie is one big joke, there's not a thing special about the acting here(what, because Heathe Ledger can mumble he deserves an Oscar?).  If you truely want to watch a film about a love story that's truely award worthy watch ""Walk The Line"".  That's how true love should be visualised on film, ""BBM"" is just garbage.Ha! Ha! Ha!  Heath, Jake & Co. sure looked to be in low spirits at the end of Oscar night.  I can just hear what musta' been going through their heads ""You mean I did that movie for nothing?""  Ha! Ha!

It certainly doesn't run in the traditional ""it all works out in the end"" mill of Hollywood films. What you take away from it depends largely on your personal views. If the thought of two men loving each other disgusts you, you should probably skip this one and instead choose the Unforgiven HD-DVD to get your cowboy fix.  The film follows the story of two young men, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, who meet working as sheep herders on rugged Brokeback Mtn in Wyoming in 1963.  The two men quickly bond while they depend on each other to uphold their tough job responsibilities.  One drunken night Jack makes a sexual advance on Ennis and the reprocussions from that event sweep over the next two decades after the men come down off the mountain and go their separate ways.  Later they rekindle their relationship despite their seemingly heterosexual lives. Jack pushes for a more substantial relationship but Ennis' surplus repression prevents him from imagining a good life living with the person he loves, another man. While there is alot of serious subject matter at hand, director Ang Lee does a great job mixing up tension you will feel with great and sometimes subtle moments of comedy. The great story and scenery are backed up by top notch acting from all corners.The HD-DVD release is by far the best way to experience this movie.  The cinematography is a joy to watch even though you're looking at Canada mostly and not Wyoming is still is a gorgeous film.  I was blown away by the color and detail.  Frankly, it looked better on my TV than it did projected in the theatre.Sure people are going to diss this movie over and over because of the ""gay theme"".  If you are not gay but compassionate about the rights that gay people fight for all over the world in terms of acceptance and equality then you may really like this film. Yes it deals with very controversial issues; This is not Leave it to Beaver folks. Traditional ideas about sexuality are blown away. It is because of a deep repression, not the flaws of the characters, that everyone loses here. In a sense this movie mirrors a great love story like Romeo and Juliet.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"The story of ""Brokeback Mountain"" -- the love affair of two gay men over the course of 20 years in the American West -- had great potential. Imagine the depths of heart that could be explored by this unexpected relationship, and the frank exchanges about the lies that gay men had/have to live to survive in society. Imagine them helping each other to maintain the veneer of their cover-job marriages, and the anguish of having to pretend to love women they could only admire as sisters. Imagine too how they might share pride at the children they had fathered. Imagine too the silly little cultural references that could be made as these two unlikely lovers lived through that 1960s and disco `70s.But there was none of this. The story, as translated from E. Annie Proulx's short story, was anemic. It was often hard to know what was going on the in the characters' minds. Changes in relationship came without warning or reason. For instance, one minute, the two leads are purportedly standoffish heterosexual cowpokes; then, without benefit of a narrative or visual thread, they are madly in love. This might have been acceptable in the early stages of their relationship. But they were just as inscrutable years later. Neither was I impressed by the scenery, which I found barren and lifeless rather than ruggedly beautiful. The subtext of danger, under which gays existed in the 1960s, was largely and inexplicably absent from the film.There were wonderful performances. Heather Ledger was terrific as the taciturn Ennis Del Mar, and Kate Mara was bashful and vulnerable as his 19-year-old daughter Alma Jr..  Michelle Williams was wonderful as loyal, betrayed Ennis's wife Alma. But Jake Gyllenhaal's character Jack Twist was flat and unemotional. And knocks to the makeup department for some truly unconvincing facial hair!The haunting musical theme by Gustavo Santaolalla was a standout. I wish I could say that the rest of BBM moved me. I couldn't connect with characters who seemed to be completely disconnected from the people and times that surrounded them. Given the incredible press and attention this movie generated, I expected much more. I wish too that I didn't have to risk my ""bona fides"" as being broadminded, as I have had to do,  because I am not enthusiastic about this film. A film should be measured on its artistic merits, not on whether it advances an agenda, however laudable."	3.0	What am I missing?	2006-02-28	28	9	19

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3RI3ELN94LYBO	Jeff E. King	I have seen a lot of Gay Drama films; unlike the rest, this is pretty similar to what most gay guys have gone through. This is to say, that all gay men have loved another gay guy that hasn't returned that love, felt confused and even scared to let people know (especially if you live in rural America) who they are, and like this movie there are still hate crimes because of who people are.People have really saw this movie as being about gay cowboys. However, I think it questions who we are as gay men and what this country is to still allow hate crimes to continue. In just looking at the critiques posted here, we can clearly see that people aren't welcoming of other views; therein lies the problem with the USA. If anything Brokeback Mountain reminds me of a foreign film, but highly relatable.	5.0	Not another gay drama	2006-03-22	35	22	13
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3MWYPZBKL1NJ	Jeffery Mingo	"1.  In Michael Bronski's anthology ""Taking Liberties: Gay Men on Sex, Politics...."", there is a great essay about how rooms function in gay male literature.  Since male homosexuality is stigmatized, much of it has to take place in closed, private spaces.  The author points to Baldwin's ""Giovanni's Room"" as a classic example of this.  ""Brokeback"" takes that idea and turns it on its head.  Instead of a cramped room usually in some big, anonymous metropolis, the lovers here have a huge open area as their private sanctuary.  There are no doors or walls in the film, yet they have their relative unseen special place.  I only saw Van Sant's ""My Own Private Idaho"" once.  That's the only other film that I can think of as remotely using open space as a metaphoric ""gay room.""2.  Of course, I'm obsessed with the representation of gay men of color in film.  I have an Amazon.com list called ""A Gay Minority Man Walks By.""  It lists many of the movies where a GMOC appears and then disappears just as quickly.  There's a crow who only speaks one line and who is supposed to represent a GBM in the adult cartoon ""Fritz the Cat.""  ""16 Candles""' Long Duck Dong plays a stereotypical GAM in ""Booty Call.""  ""Brokeback"" is a virtually all-white movie, even though Texas (one of its locations) has many people of color in it.  Jake G. picks up some trade in Mexico.  If you blinked, you would have missed it.  The hustler says nothing.  This potentially, and problematically, renders a man in the developing world silent.  However, if he said, ""Hey, Big Daddy, wanna good time?"", it would have been seen as equally problematic.  Plus, many prostitutional transactions may be done without words, especially in international tricking/sex tourism."	4.0	2 more thoughts on this film	2006-01-19	10	4	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1FXPZ5K1C1NBY	Jeff Pearlman	"I'd like to think I'm more objective than many people about this movie.  Gay-oriented material doesn't offend me, yet I laughed at all the jokes made about this movie when it came out (NO PUN INTENDED!).  I bought it after the '05 Oscar noms were announced, but didn't open it for two years.  The right mood never seemed to hit me:  ""what to watch...Comedy?  Horror?  Action?  Kissing Cowboys?""  I finally watched it after I heard about Heath Ledger's tragic, accidental overdose.It's a good movie, a little slow in parts, but with some deeply moving scenes.  Unless they are seeing something I missed, reviewers who whine about naked men romping all over the place are simply lying for their own reasons.  As I recall, the only nudity in sexual situations is that of female characters; Ledger's character's buttocks (and I guess, therefore, Ledger's) are in the background of one scene--he's bathing, with Gyllenhaal's character (deliberately?) NOT looking.  The guys actually do a bit of romping (I should look that word up) in one scene and in another, jump nude into a lake, but are shown from too far a distance to either delight or disgust anyone.  I assume.Unlike some of my friends, I don't agree that ""Brokeback"" is all that ""romantic.""  Although some scenes make clear that Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are happier and more relaxed with each other than they are anywhere else, more often they're fighting, usually over Ennis' refusal to commit to a full-time relationship.  Another reviewer smartly referenced ""Same Time, Next Year"" though in a (way) more negative way.I also have trouble seeing how anyone could consider ""romantic"" the first time Ennis and Jack...are intimate.  I didn't notice any signs of attraction between them before they suddenly had at it.  They didn't seem very happy about it all, which began abruptly (not necessarily a bad thing), but they seemed almost hostile, with no talk and a little confusion (mostly on Ennis' part).  Oh, and much grunting.  The scene, by the way, involved no nudity.  OK, so I looked away a little.  There was at most a little of the top of Gyllenhaal's buttocks.  From some of these other reviews, you'd think these guys spent two hours swinging from chandeliers.I also felt the wives' points of view were underrepresented.  It's not clear Anne Hathaway's Lureen ever figured it all out, though her sad transformation from feisty to frosty suggests she did.  Michelle Williams' Alma found out early, though she didn't confront Ennis until much later.  I found that believable because I've known couples to ignore even the biggest pink (or white, they could be white) elephants to avoid the bigger trauma of breaking up.The scene that convinced me this movie was a keeper and not a disappointment involved Jack's first visit with Ennis since THAT summer.  About four years had passed and both had married.  Ennis compulsively flicks his lighter, pathetically waiting by the window.  Alma prepares to tolerate a dull night of ranching stories over dinner somewhere.  Jack finally shows, Ennis runs out to him and kisses him like Jack was rescuing him from a burning building.  (Not that everyone would thank a fireman that way, of course.)  Alma sees, and Williams' shock/disbelief in those moments earned her the Oscar nom right there.  Ennis makes a lame excuse to run out with Jack. Alma, still holding her purse to got out, is heartbreakingly left in her kitchen to try and make sense of what the hell she just saw.  The scene established that that it was Ledger's character (relatively more ""straight-acting""), not Gyllenhaal's (more ""sensitive""), that was more desperate for the relationship.  At the same time, we feel Alma's emotional abaondoment (though she stayed with underachieving, increasingly-detached Ennis for years afterwards).It's not post-tragedy hyperbole to say that Ledger's is the best of an excellent group of performances.  At first, he's the stereotypical ""Marlboro Man"", but the facade keeps cracking, first with Gyllenhaal, then in the big fight with Williams, and finally when alone.  Of course, Ledger didn't even sound like the Marlboro Man in ""real life"" (i.e., Australian accent).I wish more (anyone?) had written about whether Lureen's description of events in her phone call with Ennis, or what seemed to be Ennis' vision during that call, was what ""really"" happened.  My cousin insists Lureen was hiding the truth to save face.  I don't think this should have been left to conjecture, because if Ennis' vision was correct, his decision to avoid committing to Jack becomes at least partially vindicated.It's wrong to trash this movie over its gay content.  I wonder if that superficial reaction prodded some of the movie's fans to consider ""Brokeback Mountain"" an Oscar-caliber epic when I'm not sure that's the case.  I think it's excellent, am fairly certain it deserved to be nominated (but not to win*), and admire (exceptions noted above) the way it deals with a traumatic situation that happens much more often than is acknowledged (think of the Hollywood hunks that were married to gorgeous ladies but ""came out"" later in life).  I'm just not sure this is an all-time classic.  But definitely a must-see for Heath Ledger fans and for the acting all around.*After the Oscars, I did a long review of why ""Crash"" DID deserve to win.  Amazon readers were unimpressed by a current vote of 11 to 4.  Well, at least 15 people read that one...now to review ""Capote"", ""Good Night and Good Luck"", and ""Munich"" so I can get slammed three more times..."	4.0	Controversial?  This?

But this film was never marketed as one with a powerful messege, it is a film about romance, and that is the reason I saw, and enjoyed this harmouniously paced film. I sat in dark and grinned wonderfully at the vista frames and of the mild, poetic nature of it all. I fell in love with the films eager willingness to expose tenderness and then crippling the audience with its poignant, and dramatic ending. It is not your typical film. It spells originality, and that's what the Oscars, and demanding audiances search for.	5.0	Most definately to be garnerd with the most prestiguous of the awards, BF and BD	2006-02-06	15	8	7

There are both men and women in this group, and we voted, unanimously, that this should be the best picture winner.Of course, we all know what Oscar did after that...Another sexist move, but expected considering that men dominated the Oscar board.Oh, and the reviewer who said that this is a girl movie, not guys, and that straight guys should not watch this movie, you might be interested to know that I reported your comment to Amazon as inappropriate.

Unlike this reviewer, however, I see this feeling in a completely different light.The feelings you get from this movie comes from a time when same-sex love need to be kept closed doors because the society is highly homophobic. The love that developed from this time spread like wildfire, and viewers are left with the remorse for Jack's unfortunate death. This feeling SHOULD stay with you forever, and Ang Lee did a very good job creating this feeling.So overall, this film does bring tears into your eyes, but these are tears of true humanity, and people should cherish this tear, not put it off.	5.0	It stays with you forever	2006-06-04	34	29	5

In fact, it is the least important aspect about this movie. This movie is created from pure emotion, crystalized into a masterpiece that everyone can watch, understand, and feel. Director Ang Lee is a true magician, and after watching the Hulk, also directed by him, it is clear that his skills in directing are improving.

This movie will be remembered for years and years to come due to its superb acting, majestic cinematography, incredible dialog, intense emotion, cogent storyline, and the excellent score converged into making this two-hour-plus movie one of the great landmarks in the history of the cinema. I agree with those who say that this movie will be discussed and studied, along with the great ones: `Casablanca,' `Citizen Kane,' etc......Heath Ledger's rough-and-tough-but-tender-and-vulnerable performance is so believable that very little make-up was required in order to try to convince the audience that he is aging right before our eyes. As you watch him, you really do believe that this taciturn young roughneck is actually becoming a middle-aged man who is coming to terms with day to day responsibilities, family life, and an ever-present, nagging, burning need to hold onto a love that will not let him go (Sorry, couldn't resist that phrase). Can't say what has already been said regarding Michelle Williams, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Anne Hathaway because we all know they gave excellent performances.The last twenty minutes of the movie comprise some of the most gut-wrenching and emotionally painful experiences I have rarely encountered in a movie. This film is really hard to forget even though there is a gay context to this film it contains universal themes of love, intense longing, disappointment, infidelity, passion and sexual desire, all of which are applicable to all people, everywhere and anywhere.Ang Lee has done another amazing job putting this film together that was well deserved.	5.0	"Can we already call this film a ""Classic?"""	2006-07-13	53	42	11

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3MQ672FYFNM7B	JGC	"""Brokeback Mountain"" is the story of two all-man cowboys that find love in each other. The film is unique because it is not the typical gay stereo-type; perhaps it is the first mainstream film ever made on this topic?Ennis Del Mar (played by the very talented Heath Ledger) is a very quiet and rough around the edges kind of man. He doesn't show his feelings very well and is somewhat of a loner. Jack Twist (played by the equally accomplished Jake Gyllenhaal) is more vocal about his feelings and emotions, but can still be pushed around (although I did enoy it when he stood up to his bigoted father-in-law).What makes this tale so bitter is that their's is a forbidden love. It is reminiscent of ""Titanic"" or Romeo and Juliet. Please keep in mind that the picture took place during 60's, 70's, and early 80's, in Middle-America where no one was openly gay, much less a cowboy. But, despite all their differences and personal demons both men loved each other more than life itself.Anyone with connected eyeballs can tell that Ennis and Twist were deeply in love (this was not an affair, rather it was a serious relationship that lasted over two decades). It was proof that Twist loved Ennis when they were on the hill getting ready to leave after he playfully lassoed and punched Ennis. Twist looked so sad to have intentionally inflicted pain on his lover. But Ennis holed off and punched him, because no one was gonna make Ennis his fool. And it was evident that Ennis loved Twist when he sobbed like a baby on the street after they departed Brokeback Mountain separately.The cinematography in this picture was absolutely stunning. The soundtrack is also amazing. I am certain that this picture is very Oscar-worthy.I saw this movie about a month ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. It is a very full-toned and haunting picture.

For me this movie is about two ver common human emotions that even tough are very different every human been has experience them.Love.- Is very difficult to find the love of your life in this world, everybody is in a hurry and sometimes we missed the changes we have for fear, so these guys dont getting together for fear is very sad, this kind of love is rare and when Ennis found those shirts he knows how much he was loved, Jack having the oportunity to leave never did it because as the saying goes Love is a force of nature and difficul to explain.Loliness.- Even more common than love is loneliness, maybe not everyone has been in love but everyone has feel lonely in this love, so many people but again that loliness can kill you, and in a way that was happened whit these guys, Jack felt loliness since Ennis never had the courage of loving together and Ennis was left alone and with regret when Jack suddenly died, the last scene of the movie shows so much loneliness and regret that is overwhelming.I hate that this movie, a really love story, was so attacked and make fun of, can we grow up and see this as a variation of a love story? Sorry for all that did give themselves the changes to see this Masterpiece, since watching straight love stories does not make a gay person straight, seeinng this movie will not make anyone gay, but will leave thinking about your own life and the choices you have made..

I also heard jokes like could you imagine Clint Eastwood in a movie like this?  With all that everyone said (mostly negative) about this movie, I wanted to watch it anyway.  What I found was that we still live in a very stereotype driven country.  If it is about homosexuals, hetros like me need to stay away, or be made fun of for seeing it.  After viewing this movie, I came away thinking wow!  Ang Lee (director of ""The Hulk,"" ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" among others) really brought his ""A"" game with his beautiful visuals and his ability to film this visceral film.  This movie in no way was gay porn, not even close.  The movie is about two individuals who take on a job in a secluded outdoor area and develop a special bond after an intimate, unplanned event occurred.  The film tracked their progress through marriage, children and their secret outings.  The film also details two completely opposite personas with regards to their beliefs of what their relationship is, where it is going and how their inner conflict compounds their daily living and relationships with others.  It is too bad for Heath Ledger that the male lead category for the Oscars was so loaded with great performances, but I think he had just as good of a performance as winner Hoffman.  Gyllenhall's performance was good, however, he has not proven to be as dynamic of an actor as Ledger or others.  Gyllenhall, in my opinion, with his sad eyes, and same walk, plays the same part whether in ""Donnie Darko,"" ""Jarhead"" or this movie.  Ledger's versatility was proven again during this movie and we can continue to expect great things from this actor in future endeavors.  I have seen all Oscar best picture nominated films and thought winner ""Crash"" was good, but not best picture good, then I saw ""Capote"" and thought for sure that that was the movie that should have won it.  However, after seeing ""Brokeback Mountain,"" Ledger's performance, the story, the scope of the cinematography and the screenplay, I would have to cast my vote for ""Brokeback Mountain.""

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A4MTF5EIWNNTU	J. Lee	"This review might contain spoilers.This movie is brilliant. The first time I saw Brokeback Mountain, I left the movie theater in a dazed state, trying to digest what I just had seen. Wondering through some crowded streets of NYC on a cold, windy winter night, I never felt more alone. I hurried home. Many movies have left me excited, intrigued and sad. But none have left me as emotionally devastated as Brokeback has. It's as if the movie insinuated itself around my very soul and wrapped its grief around my unsuspecting heart - leaving it heartbroken ever since. The beauty of this movie is that it makes the characters seem so real, so live and their pain so raw, that the sorrow that permeates the story - hinted at first in the display of the most beautiful desolated sceneries, together with a melancholic music score, sneaks in your head, and unknowingly but quite forcefully takes hold of your body and soul and never seems to let them go.A few weeks later, after countless sleepless nights, unable to shake myself off this stupor, I saw BBM again. This time I left feeling better because it became clear to me that what I had just witnessed was one of the most beautiful love stories ever told. It doesn't matter for me that it happened to be between 2 men. Because there is something so refreshing, so innocent, so lovely about how the story unfolds, that it literally turned this quite jaded, a bit cynical New Yorker, inside out. But I gather that this movie is not meant for everyone. Considering the state of our world today, how we are brought up to fend for ourselves and how we are taught to never let our guards down, we shield our fragile selves from any hint of perceived emotional threats. And we shut down. But I guarantee 100% that if only you could keep the cynicism at bay for the length of this movie, it will transform you. Like I mention before, this movie really makes you hurt, a heartbreaking SOB of a love story that just kills you, but it can be life changing.Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are phenomenal. Period. This movie wouldn't work if either one of them didn't give his heart and soul completely. What a remarkable screen performance these two give - a performance dug directly from the heart. Amazing. Some criticize that the characters don't develop enough rapport before that first scene in the tent. Nonsense. Haven't you ever heard of something called instant chemistry? And both Heath L. and Jake G. deliver throughout the movie. I bow my head to these guys. Of course the movie wouldn't work either without the great, touching performances from Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway and Roberta Maxwell.This was a wonderful work from Ang Lee. To portray this movie in such a delicate, sensitive way merits all ovations it gets. During an interview, Ang Lee said that when casting, he decided to go after young and innocent. That choice has really paid off here because in a way that's why the movie works: because to find love when one is so young, so innocent, that is the purest kind of love. When tragedy hits later on the movie, and somehow we kind of expect that from the start, the only thing that remains out of this now flawed, resentful relationship is a sense of love.  But Jack and Ennis' souls have been irremediably broken.Alas, this is the price these doomed individuals pay for living a life denied and full of lies. The soul dies first before physical death occurs. We see it happen in Jack's case, his soul dying, so touchingly captured in his mournful, dead blank eyes at their last fateful meeting when he watches Ennis' truck speed away. He bitterly tells Ennis: ""We could've had a good life together...but YOU didn't want it...so Brokeback is all we got"" finally letting all his resentment spill out on their most unsatisfactory relationship. To which Ennis replies, accusingly, angrily: ""It's because of you Jack...that I'm like this...I'm nothing...I'm nowhere"" before collapsing to the ground as if the weight of  this impossible affair suddenly becomes too heavy a burden for him to carry. Jack rushes back to comfort him, and they hug mightily, desperately clinging to one another for they know that they have reached some crossroads in their hearts - their relationship hanging by a thread, they cannot help but watch it slip away.To his part, Ennis fares no better. When we last see him, alone in that empty, desolated trailer, surveying those shirts that he now tenderly guards, he swears love to a man that no longer exists but in his dreams and memories - a late cry of acknowledgment for what he always had felt but never dared to verbally express during those long 20 years. And like the emptiness of his trailer, Ennis' soul, so long tormented about a crime he saw as a child and so terrified by the notion that the love of his life was another man, cries in despair for a love forever lost, and it is now destined to wither away in solitary confinement.Thus, the tragedy and paradox of Brokeback Mountain: Love can help save a man from destroying a life that could have been but a man cannot save himself if love is left buried and hidden in the deepest corner of the human heart. Something has to give.  So Jack and Ennis: if only I should come to feel a love like that, God help me, but I for one will not hold back. Thank you for showing me the reason why."	5.0	If only I should come to feel a love like that...	2006-03-29	116	105	11

I believe if some is gay deep inside they cannot pretend to be somebody else.  Pretending to be someone else is more harmful than helpful, and they end up suffering more.  Society is still scared to death of people who are ""too different.""  What a powerful lesson this film teaches.  Even Dora should understand that her so called Christian moralizing does not match up with the truth exuding from this award winning film.  Until human beings are able to understand people who are different rather than hurting them, we are still running in place.  We have a ways to go.It's all about tolerance the Golden Rule...treat others like you would like to be treated.  You should know this if you are a 5th grader or a senior citizen.  The ethic of reciprocity (or the Golden Rule) is a general moral principle found in virtually all religions and culture, often as a fundamental rule, a fact which suggests that it may be related to innate aspects of human nature (see altruism). It is most commonly rendered as ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you"", or in other words ""treat others as you want to be treated"".In most formulations it takes a passive form, as expressed by the Jewish sage Hillel: ""What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man.""In Western culture, however, the most famous formulation is active, as expressed in the Torah as ""love your neighbor as yourself"" (Leviticus 19:18).This traditional guiding rule was (and is) so highly valued that it has for centuries been known in English as the ""Golden Rule"".Congrats on those who had the guts and integrity to make this picture.  I hope it starts and long and healthy dialogue about tolerance and love.  This country needs good political dialogues so desperately.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2N60TJIK7YKSG	"J Montoya ""julio"""	This is a piece of work that is so powerful in all respects that it simply won't go out of your mind, and no matter what happens at the Academy awards, it will stay with you longer than any of the others.  It reminds me of what happened with K Hepburn in African Queen as against Viven Leigh in Streetcar.  Leigh won for a very fine performance, but Hepburn's movie and her performance have been shown many times more than Streetcar - I suppose it's the difference between admiration and helpless involvement.  Heath Ledger creates a tortured man who is already inside most people and can be recognized as part of one's own self.  Hoffman,as Capote, does a stunning impersonation of a man, almost freakish, who is recognized more as someone one has perhaps known, and perhaps is recognized, but not always as someone lurking under the surface of one's own self.  But the movie is certainly not solely dependent on Heath's creation.  Everything in the script fits tightly with everything else - more evidence, if we need it, of Larry McMurty and his collaborator's sublime achievement in glueing themselves to Annie Proulx' original remarkable creation.  I have been attending movies for 75 years (yes, really), and I remember lots of them.  This is among the very greatest I have seen.	5.0	Just try to get it off your mind	2006-02-07	25	16	9
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3QP1LM5A0PRXG	J. Moore	"I won't go on and on about how beautiful the scenery is, how great the acting is, how wonderful the direction is, and how touching the story is.  Plenty of reviews have already done that.However, I do want to address some of the complaints about this movie.  I have heard people complain that Brokeback Mountain wouldn't be getting as much recognition if it were a love story between a man and woman. These people are claiming that the movie really isn't very good but is achieving critical acclaim due to the its controversial storyline.  I cannot disagree more, and here is why:1)  This is NOT just a movie about gay cowboys.  Yes, the two men fall in love and carry out out a twenty-year long affair.  However, the movie is more about unrequited love, and how external influences can prevent true love from ever fully blossoming.  I know plenty of movies that received a huge amount of critical acclaim that sound very similar:  The Bridges of Madison County, Titanic, and Love Story are good examples.  These are audience favorites that remind us how painful and sad love can really be--and Brokeback Mountain accomplishes this as well.2)  The ""controversial"" content really isn't all that ground-breaking.  Doesn't anybody remember other critical favorites that touched upon homosexual love?  The Color Purple??  That was over twenty years ago!  And Brokeback and the Color Purple also both focus on OTHER issues besides being gay--family, violence, and finding strength and confidence in one's self.3)  There are other factors that make this movie great besides the controversial content--the musical score is beautiful, the acting is right on target (Heath Ledger in particular succeeds in exuding multiple emotions while barely speaking), the cinematography is gorgeous, and the screenplay is a model of how to adapt a short story into a movie--it keeps all the scenes and dialogue while expanding the areas that help move the plot forward (the women in particular get larger roles in the movie).All in all, I feel that anyone who says this movie is getting all this attention simply because it's about two men falling in love hasn't watched the movie.  They haven't seen it, or they'd realize it encompasses what could be the largest human desire that we know of:  that we all want to be loved, and when we find that person we shouldn't let him or her go.  Who can't relate to that?"	5.0	Don't Judge, Just Watch	2006-02-09	21	15	6

For this reason, even after Oprah herself gave strong recommendations for the world to watch Brokeback Mountain, I still did not do it. In fact, the reason I bought the DVD in the first place is because the popularity of this movie only increased after months since the DVD release, and I didn't know what to expect. But after I watched it, I found myself crying uncontroably, mostly due to how I treated homosexual people in the past.For what it's worth, this movie makes you a better person when you watch it, and you start recognize the injustice of this world, and of yourself, and begin to carry out life different.

It is quite simply a Masterpiece from it's first frame to it's last. It is not anything as trivial as THE gay cowboy movie. If anything it is about two bisexual men but it is so much more than that. I will probably get heaps of unhelpful votes for the following statements but that is fine. Last I heard America still had freedom of Speech so here goes; Brokeback Mountain lost the Best Picture Oscar because the voters were afraid of it's theme and because of political pressure. Remember, ""Citizen Kane"" lost Best Picture because of the pressure put on the academy from the Hearst regime back in the 1940's. Most people don't even remember what won that year but how many top ten lists does ""Kane"" still appear on over 60 years after it's release?

Ennis and Jack, the two main characters, are thrown together in the summer of '63, tending to sheep on Brokeback Mountain. One thing leads to another and both are forever changed. I know some have completely oversimplified this movie as a ""gay cowboy"" movie, but that is so far from the core of it. BBM is a love story, an epic one, which has never been done in gay themed movies (usually movies with gay characters as the focal point do not span anywhere near 20 years). It deservingly is the most acclaimed film of the year and should've been named best picture of the year by the academy, but who cares what they think. The performances are amazing. Heath Ledger is breathtaking. He totally became Ennis Del Mar. The same can be said for Jake Gyllenhaal, who is brilliant as Jack Twist. The supporting cast is also great.

Another problem I had with this was the tent scene, the brightness is so low that on the three T.V.'s that I tried to watch it on, I had to turn the brightness all the way up just to see the scene. It makes me wonder if the studio hedged it's bet by making it so dark that maybe it wouldn't offend as much. I tried 6 disc and had the same problem on all of them. Some of you are going to say that maybe I'm homophobic, but that's your problem not mine,I just didn't find the movie that good and the brightness issue strikes me as a form of censorship and I won't tolerate that at all.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ABDAHMRYSMMIV	"John Ellis ""jonthes"""	"""Brokeback Mountain"" isn't a breakthrough film because it's about a homosexual relationship, or about sex between two 'manly' cowboys, it's because its true subject is passion and thwarted devotion. The sex in it between the men is chaste to a fault - the sex between them and their wives in their troubled marriages is much more explicit, though plot points are deftly made in those scenes. The film isn't being attacked for the very limited sex, it's the deep love that has raised protests, boycotts, attempts to block the sale in certain states. Those attempts of course only highlight how little has changed. If Scorsece's jealous gibe that it looks like a Marlboro commercial is true in a few shots, that's because the Marlboro commercials were beautifully shot. Scorsece would not have been able to resist hammering home the violence in the plot; Ang Lee handles that with great artistry that I hope (but doubt) will be influencial, not a second more than is necessary to the story. Ennis' last line is debated in some circles like Rhett's. I read it as an expression of devotion too late to mean anything; and heartbreaking because it's what most of us do or experience in love, there is usually a very small window for true love or passion to be acted on, then it's lost. When you figure that out, it's too late, it's gone. The hope of art is that seeing a situation from outside we can grow out of it. ""Brokeback"" is the rare Hollywood film that even attempts to work as art. It gets it all right, and is largely as simple as a fable. It is a film with an open heart.

The Blu-Ray audio is more dynamic and clear and allows minute details like readable small print on a can of beans, which is just a blur on the DVD.There are 3 extra features on the Blu-Ray which are apparently on the ""2 disc"" DVD but aren't on the single DVD - and two of them are quite significant: ""A Groundbreaking Success"" (~16 minutes) looks at the film's many aspects of achieving bona-fide success (including financially), despite active homophobic opposition.""Music From The Mountain"" gives us a much greater appreciation of the soundtrack music and of how truly integral it is to the impact of the whole film. I've also been privileged to give a personal hug of appreciation to both Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson at their Brisbane shows, so it's a real treat to see them here as an acknowledged element of what works so beautifully in this film.I loved Annie Proulx's short story.

It is also one of the few films which not only enhances, but also in no way compromises the emotional impact or moral integrity of the source material.Even if you already own the DVD, purchase of the Blu-Ray version is justified for anyone who truly appreciates the film, its historical significance, and its potential to continue do great good in the world as one of the all-time classic - and unapologetically gay - romances."	5.0	Brokeback Blu-Ray as superior to the DVD version	2009-03-30	13	10	3

Especially in the 1960's in the macho, western United States. Some of our political leaders today (dinosaurs really) still live in that time. They should step down from office like they promised in 1994. Anyway, two western guys shepherding high in the mountians alone one summer experience physical love. Guilty, at first, they part & go on to assume tradtional married with children lives. They meet years later & it's obvious the attraction is still strong. What follows is a bittersweet affair spanning many years. Ennis is the silent stoic type, apparently emotional empty & ambivalent if not for Jack. He's alive & willing it seems, to chuck everything & pursue a permenant life with Ennis. It seems that their love is only fully realized with the background of the mountain where they first fell in love. They visit it as often as they can get away from their familes. There they can love without fear or guilt in the vast, quiet beauty of the that place. It ends like a tragic, Shakeperean play. Heath Ledger as Ennis & Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack may never be better than they are in this movie. The real winner is the spectacular beauty of the mountain. This is an Academy Award caliber movie, in small part because of the time we are in now. It's a fashionable topic. Aside from that, it is time well spent.	4.0	Same time next year?	2006-02-24	25	16	9

There are some ""reviews"" listed here that are offensive, and of course those are probably written by the same people who would think a great film example would be ""Momma's Big House II"" or ""Yours Mine and Ours""--not to insinuate that there is anything wrong with light hearted films of that genre - but the point is BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN tackles a delicate subject in a way that has NEVER been dipicted before.  Many movie-goers tend to think of gay characters as funny, frivolous, silly and ridiculous. To a certain degree this is the way gay characters have been portrayed on the silver screen and on our TV screens as well.  Even very entertaining tv sitcoms such as WILL AND GRACE are actually at times unintentionally reinforcing Society's overview of negative stereotypical behavior - see the funny gay next door neighbor, isn't he cute, isn't he fun to be around ~ we don't have to take him seriously. Then, flip over to another station to watch QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY - hey look, look at these gay guys, aren't they funny, aren't they cute, they sure know how to decorate - they sure do know about fashion - they are ""harmless"" enough, we don't have to take them seriously. Along comes BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.....hey wait a minute!  These guys seem just like two regular guys....they aren't funny ~ they don't seem to know about fashion....they have real feelings for each other and have genuine love for each other which they can't express openly due to the confines of Society's borders - what is ""this"" all about?  Well, it's about a movie that is so magnificent, so well written, so incredibly superior to the average JUNK fare that is being churned out that it is beyond the scope of understanding of the average movie-goer.

Had the wrong movie get turned onby mistake? No...this was really happening on the screen. Herewere these two rugged macho guys...cowboys up there doing whatmakes men tremble at the thought of doing: making love. I managedto stay in my seat...then came the ride on the stallion, theforeboding sky, the journey to tend sheep but really only Godknew where to. My eyes misted thinking what the cowboy must have felt seeing that butchered sheep. I suddenly thought of lots ofthings, like what the rest of the movie was like, thought of myfriend and why he kept the sex scene a secret, but mostly Ithought of an old admonition I'd heard about how a man isn't supposed to have a romantic interest in another man. Yeah...I'd hoped the movie would show the two cowboys turning intostandard creeps for whom I could have no sympathy for. But I wasnot so lucky, for by the time the movie was over my cup ran overwith empathy for these two. Something touched me and my eyes misted over by film's ending and Ennis sad.I left the theatre in no mood to shop. I decided to dropin on my friend. He was busy developing film, but listened anywayas I asked him why he didn't warn me about you know what. ""Causeif I did you wouldn't have gone, am I right?"" Yeah...I had toadmit he was right. I am just the type who avoids the strange.Then he said ""Now tell me what you liked?"" Then I unloaded andtold him the directing reminding me of George Stevens. Themusic breath-taking...the scenery gorgeous. Then, saving my bestfor last, told him of Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack with doe-like eyesthat worked so well for him, making his character easy to read.That look of devotion he gives to Ledger...so convinced me he'dwait around forever! Then there's the amazing Heath, a virtualtreasure trove of talent. The look, the gesture, that walk ofhis, even his grunting...they'd be crazy if they didn't givehim the Oscar. He has all these and he breaks your heart withthem. His scenes at the end were brilliant. He could open up aschool for acting any day. In his quiet moments he does more withless than anyone acting today. My friend smiled and then casuallyasked me if ""Brokeback Mt."" changed me in any way. I didn't knowwhat to say. Suddenly something hit me, something that had beenlooking at me that I'd not wanted to recognize since I left thetheatre, thinking it would go away.""Well?"" my friend asked. I said it may sound funny...butI was sure Randolph Scott was looking at me. My friend let out anenormous laugh. Yeah...like he's waiting for something from me.Like what my attitude was towards Ennis and Jack. Would I approveof them riding along the chisolm trail with him? It's dumb, I know, but since they've been through so much misery that maybe...maybe we'd show our hearts are in the right place and allow themto come? I even remembered my childhood toy gun and holster andcowboy hat...one that had puff balls like fringe around the crown. My mom bought me that hat. Yeah, maybe this movie heldobjectionable things in it when examined using the head. Yetsome things and some movies should be looked at with the heartmore than with the head.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3K7Z2KT2HOU8L	John Sandhu	Unlike what the two recent reviewers say about Brokeback Mountain, society still has a lot of pressure on how a person should live, and behave.Brokeback Mountain is a wakeup call for people to see what the world truly is. Gay bashing has always existed, and still exists. Even today, even when someone is killed, as long as the person is homosexual, the media and police will turn a blind eye against the case (as in the case of Rashawn Brazell, New York)Consider this movie as a cry for our desire of a better world. If society really will happily accept these two characters as couples, why do they need to go behind their wives' backs? Remember, the only relationships where cheating occurs is unsatisfied ones that should be broken off anyways.	5.0	The most important reason to watch Brokeback Mountain	2006-05-30	13	10	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2XLAJEPT9DPYY	"Jokie X Wilson ""jokiex"""	I don't know that love is intended to make sense or be responsible, so it seems pretty terrible that society would place unkind restrictions on it and expect everyone to neatly follow along. But, that it does and this movie shows the ups and downs of the aftereffects of such restrictions. And when there is no vocabulary to discuss a relationship that isn't supposed to exist because it supposedly isn't normal, yikes!This movie takes place before there were clearly places to go off to live permanently in order to avoid the disapproval of those who frown on gay relationships. And it shows what happens when two men in love have to play it straight in order to keep from getting killed. But, beyond that, it shows the tragedy of this when the love is of a higher order than even the so-called normal people can achieve.It would be nice if someday a movie like this could actually end happily ever after. But, for now, it reflects a bitter pill that we all must swallow. As a society, if we really want to promote love and kindness, we ned to get past the need to box love into sterilized categories. We also need to recognize the beauty of the clandestine relationships that result from our oppression, not be too judgemental, and perhaps accept that what we call normal may need to be redefined a little.It is up to each of us to resolve the moral dilemmas in this movie. The acting is evokative, the secenery stunning, the symbolism deep. But, most importantly, it gives us all something to chew on. And I think it is meant to indicate to us that there is much more at stake than social order. And just what it is that we are to value more deeply than social order is left as more of a question that we can keep asking ourselves over and over. And that question is largely, just what is love?	5.0	A Timeless Classic	2006-09-11	5	3	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A6X1MX9O8TR28	Jonna Lee Anderson	So much has been written about this film, I have little to add. All I can say is that this film 'broke all the rules' and I was aghast and ashamed that the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences didn't have the balls to give it the best picture award that it so richly deserved. Because of that, I have given up watching the Academy Awards as it is obvious now (well, it was really obvious before, but I was ever-hopeful) that it is a total political game and not at all about which film is the best, which performance is the best, or who deserves to win. I own the film and watch it often. As heartbreaking as it is, and even though it always makes me cry, it has such a deep haunting feeling about it that draws me to it over and over again. Thank you to Ang Lee and all the actors for bringing this film to us - all of us who have watched it and learned from it are the richer for the experience.	5.0	Simply the Best film I've ever seen	2007-04-24	17	15	2
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AFT0L64HQ82MO	Jonnie Santos	Going to the movies these days is a challenge.  I talk myself out of the experience 9 out of 10 times when I think of the process of getting there, including wrestling with traffic and parking, and thinking of the reality of sitting there through 20 minutes of commercials and movie previews before the real show begins.Challenges aside, the movie was worth seeing.It starts off like soft Gay porn with lots of writing around it to dilute or slow the build to the first sex scene in the tent.Beginning in the 1960's, the characters are both White, thin and too pretty, which only supports an idealized version of the cowboys from what I feel is a very homoerotic stance.You can feel the tension building between Jack's pursuing of Ennis, using alcohol to build courage in one and lower inhibitions in the other.Then at that first sex scene in the tent when the Ennis mounts Jack from behind and does the classic porn spit (in lieu of lubricant) into his hand before doing the deed, I'm left thinking Ennis is either not as inexperienced as he plays to be or Ang Lee was going for the money shot.Over the course of the next 20 years Ennis and Jack build a world of lies with marriages and children, only to escape on fishing trips to Brokeback Mountain for time they could share with each other.  Their time together is sweet, image filled and a chance to learn more about the conversationally challenged Ennis.The flavor of the story, even when it isn't, is made to feel tragic.  Repressed Ennis was initially a conquest for the worldlier and scheming Jack.  Jack is made fun of in his Straight world as a mess-up, and Ennis just isn't smart enough to get out of his own way.Jack ends up being Gay bashed and Ennis remained dirt poor with only his memories of Brokeback Mountain.  Score anther one for the Straight community and fostering the notion that Gays are tragic people and always damaged goods, despite their ability to love and be loved.Roll credits.	3.0	Lies, Sheep and Boring Wyoming	2005-12-18	69	11	58

Ang Lee rarely disappoints, and this is no exception.Yes, it's about ""gay cowboys"", but it's so much more. The movie has no agenda other than telling it's story, which is moving and beautiful.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A12K71MV2XDXRF	Jose Antonio Area Portaba	"I've noticed a few reviews mentioning that the film isn't saying anything relevant about social tolerance and that it wouldn't have received the attention it has or considered ""groundbreaking"" if the story was about a man and a woman falling in love instead of two men. Those people are not only wrong, but they're also missing the entire point of the film. If the story was between a man and a woman instead of two men, there simply would be no Brokeback Mountain; there would be no story to tell because the whole subject and theme of the film lies within two MEN who fall in love and the conflict of their own feelings towards each other. Besides being a love story (a beautiful and profoundly moving one at that), Brokeback Mountain is also (as the Amazon reviewer accurately puts it) a social study about the ""ripple effects"" that the denial of this love has not only on Ennis and Jack, but also on those close to them. Being forced to live a life of lies, secrecy, doubt and emotional disconnection because the people around just don't understand what you're going through. And that's what makes the film so powerful and insightful.I've read other reviews condemning Jack and Ennis' affair because the film supposedly wants to sympathize with two men cheating on their wives. Again, people missing the point. As mentioned early, that is one of the ""ripple effects"" of Ennis and Jack not being able to fulfill their love. You see, if society was fully accepting of homosexual relationships at the time (not that they completely are now) the film is set in, Ennis and Jack would've never been forced to marry women and live a life of lies, secrets and unfulfilment. Not only wasn't homosexuality not accepted by society at the time, but gays were also MURDERED just for being gays, as the film points out in Ennis' flashback. So basically, these men just couldn't live as they were, so they had no choice but live ""normal"" lives.That brings me to the other theme the film tackles, which is self-acceptance. Within their social context, Ennis and Jack didn't see themselves as gay because they simply didn't accept it or even approached the concept. So when they realize how they feel for each other, they just don't know what to make of their feelings; they deny and even reject their own nature (""I ain't queer""). It's not only about society not accepting their ""kind"" of love, it's about THEM not fully accepting and giving in to each other; especially Ennis, whose fear and complete inability to accept both himself and Jack's love is what ultimately dooms them, which makes the love story even more devastating.Anyone who can't understand what the film's message is and what it's aiming for either needs to have a moral and conscience check, or is simply beyond help."	5.0	People missing the point...	2006-03-30	60	53	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AX0KJ7MZDKLBM	Joseph Rochetto	"I want to respond to a few of the comments by other reviewers.  First, let me say that Brokeback Mountain is a powerful movie and a work of art.  I am a gay man and have seen hundreds of gay movies, including ""gay cowboy"" movies.  None have moved me as much as this movie.  All the actors, the writing, directing, etc. are phenominal.  Heath Ledger is remarkable.  How a twenty-six year old straight male can have such understanding, compassion and depth of emotion is almost incomprehensible to me.Now to my remarks.  One writer wishes Ennis had spoken more and was unmoved by the shirt scene towards the end.  This scene just blows me away and brings me to tears even after seeing it 5 times.  Ennis doesn't speak much because that is the way Annie Proulx wrote the character.  Ang Lee and the screenwriters are being true to the story.Second, several writers commented that they did not see the reason for the relationship between Jack and Ennis.  This actually is perhaps too subtley revealed in a brief flashback Jack has near the end of the movie when Ennis, as a young man, walks up to him from behind and holds him very tenderly.  To those who have not seen the movie this scene is depicted in a lot of posters and such you may have seen.  This scene is a reference to a few lines in the original story.  Both men came from very emotionally impoverished lives.  We know that Jack was never really loved or emotionally supported by his father. The view of his childroom bedroom reveals a total bareness of emotion, love or beauty in his upbringing.  In the short story it is stated that the memory of this one embrace and all the feeling that came with it, the emotions it freed, twenty years earlier, and not sex, is what kept Jack coming back to Ennis for twenty years of ""infrequent high altitude f...ks"".  I can understand this completely.  Jack, in that embrace, experiences all the emotional closeness and warmth he never had from any man growing up.  It must be a tremendous release to a man, born gay, but having no understanding of warmth between men.  Jack returns again and again to Ennis because of the power of this early embrace.  Would they make it as a couple if they actually lived together twenty years?  Who knows?  Who cares?  See the movie."	5.0	A powerful story sparsely written	2006-01-10	10	8	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A34D06JL7LC6MU	"Joshua Miller ""Josh"""	"This movie was the ""IT"" movie of 2005. It was the most talked about, most joked about, it scored the most Oscar nominations.It won 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture for director Ang Lee and was the subject of the big Oscar upset when 'Crash' won Best Picture. Personally, I think 'Crash' was a better movie. But despite it's labels (""the gay cowboy movie"") and the jokes made on it's behalf (Brownback Mountain, etc.) this movie proves to be one of the best films of 2005 and a deeply sad movie about unexpected love. I'm straight, so I was worried when I saw this movie just how affected I would be by the love story of two men...I was surprised. Oscar nominee Heath Ledger (Best Actor, Brokeback Mountain) stars as Ennis Del Mar, a tightlipped cowboy searching for work. Ennis ends up at a trailer where he meets Jack Twist (Oscar nominee Jake Gyllenhaal). The two are hired (by Randy Quaid) to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain. After a while on the mountain the two hit it off and one cold night they end up having sex. The scene is somewhat graphic, but not sickening. Both Ennis and Jack are surprised by the sudden act, neither one of them are aware that they're gay. That's expressed in a fantastic scene as the two stand on a mountain and Ennis says ""You know, I ain't no queer"".""Me neither"" Jack replies. Anyway, when the job ends; both men go their separate ways. Ennis marries a woman named Alma (Oscar nominee Michelle Williams) and has two daughters. Jack moves to Texas and marries Lureen (Anne Hathaway, obviously trying to shed her ""Princess Diaries"" image) and has a son. Four years pass, when Ennis recieves a postcard from Jack. The two meet up and the passion is rekindled immediately. For the next 20 years the two continue their relationship, with Jack insisting that the two can live together somewhere on their own ranch. The tighlipped Ennis however realizes that can never be so...Also, Jack is the only one who seems to really accept that he's gay...Picking up a male prostitute in Mexico and forging a relationship with a man in Texas. Now, this story isn't really just about two gay cowboys. It's about forbidden love and I'm going to paraphrase Roger Ebert's review here; but it could have just as easily been about a muslim man and jewish woman ora black man and a white woman. It shows that love can happen at anytime even with someone you least expect. It's deep stuff.Ledger finally gets to step out into the limelight and Gyllenhaal shows off some more acting chops (which he's done before in movies like ""The Good Girl""). I haven't seen Michelle Williams outside of anything other than ""Dawson's Creek"" and it's amazing to me that she could strike up the kind of emotions she does as Alma, the wife who knows of her husbands relationship but is to nervous (and scared) to bring it up with him. Hathaway was underrated in her role as Lureen, Jack's wife and shows that she could begin to be taken seriously in the years to come. This is a marvelous film, that I highly recommend.GRADE: A-"	5.0	An Affecting Film, No Matter What Your Sexuality Is	2006-04-05	28	21	7

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A34KMBISGBIBK1	"J. Perrotta ""screamqueen73"""	"Spectacular! There are no words to describe just how moving and honest and real this film is. The bottom line here is a message that transcends all barriers; gay or straight, male or female, rich or poor. The message is that love comes in many forms and if you are ever lucky enough to find a love so deep and strong, you must hang onto it regardless of all other outside factors. And when you don't, you very well could end up with nothing just as Ennis DelMar does. This is not a gay cowboy movie. It is an honest look at love and how two people who have the world against them try to follow their hearts but succumb to the pressures of a society that doesn't understand that love must transcend all.I've read a lot of the other reviews and it seems that everyone has a different take on Jack and Ennis's relationship. But this is how I see it:  Yes, they were both gay and they were both in love, not in lust, with eachother. Lust doesn't last 20 years and the fact that they did go on to have so-called ""normal"" relationships with the women they married was not because they were bisexual but because they were doing what they thought they ""had"" to do. They tried hard to deny who they really were inside and married women, had families, then girlfriends but this was all part of the social pressure they felt to be ""normal"". Jack had more guts than Ennis did and was desperate to have a life with him because he needed him and loved him so badly, but Ennis was too uncomfortable with his love for Jack, was too embarrassed by it and couldn't have followed his heart because he was too consumed with the murder of the gay man he'd witnessed as a child. It isn't until the end, when Jack is gone, that Ennis comes to the realization that he let the love of his life slip through his hands. His daughter has found love and is getting married, Alma has remarried and Ennis finds himself alone with nothing to love or hang onto because he let his fears and insecurities about who he was come before his true love for Jack. The lesson is a hard one but the message is simple: No matter who you are or who you love, don't let anyone tell you who you should be. If you have love to give, give it freely and to whomever you wish. Never, never, never deny your heart."	5.0	A Masterpiece of Modern Cinema	2006-06-17	46	40	6

You name it, if it's an American Icon, it's been trashed ..... the church, the Pilgrims, Columbus, George Washington, sports heroes, American business, the American military, the police, the President, ""Dead White Males,"" etc etc.  All to cut out our beliefs, make us weak, make us ashamed of our heritage, and open us up to radical change.  BUT there was always the Cowboy.  The Cowboy, the strong, self-reliant, self-confident yet humble, physically and mentally tough Cowboy.  He faced down the elements, wild animals, Indian attacks, and outlaws; he rode horses all day, roped cattle, slept out in front of a fire, and shot guns when he had to.  Now THAT was an image that Americans could look upon and get some inspiration from.So of course, Hollywood had to go after the Cowboy and trash him in our minds.  Replace that image with something twisted.  OK, let's see, let's make him gay!  And two of them getting it on out in the wilderness!  Now, make this into a seemingly intelligent, compelling & artful movie, so the critics have less reason to put it down, and there it is ............ you've just shot down one of America's icons.  Anytime anyone brings up the Cowboy as an example of America's proud past and toughness, and some snide jerk will snicker, ""Oh yeah, just like Brokeback Mountain,"" and undercut the argument with sarcasm and derision.  SO that's what this movie is all about.  It's called Cultural Marxism.  Destroy America's cultural icons, and you can manipulate Americans.  (See my review of American Beauty for another example.)The filmmakers dropped two gay Greenwich Villiage guys into Wyoming and Texas, made them cowboys, and ran their little ""love"" story.  They COULD HAVE changed the characters and setting and kept a similar story, but no, they had to go for the jugular, and trash the image of the Cowboy.  Next thing you know, they'll make a movie about Patton and make him gay.  Or two gay Marines on Iwo Jima.

The little dialogue from the short story lasts the whole movie.This is a Western - Ang Lee beautifully captures the Wyoming countryside.  When the action moves into town, the sight of man's raunchy trailers and houses set against the backdrop of the majestic mountains makes a convincing argument for nature over civilization.It is civilization that is ultimately the downfall of these two characters.  They meet and fall in love - all the while convinced that they are not homosexuals.  The story begins in 1963 and - if it had occurred a little later - tragedy may have been averted.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2GM9GNP2G8HO1	J. R. SOUTH	"A hundred years from now, when cinema is being discussed, ""Brokeback Mountain"" will be loved, degraded, re-evaluated, and argued about. And that is the mark of a truly great film. I am still befuddled that the Oscar voting swayed the best film award of 2005 to ""Crash"", and even more perplexed by its backhanded honor to Jake Gyllenhaal with a best supporting actor nomination, when clearly, he not only gave an astonishing performance in a leading role, but was impetus behind the entire storyline. I mean, for crying out loud, without Jake/Jack's first sexual overture, or his postcards to Ennis, what would have created the plot? Long before I had even heard about ""Brokeback Mountain"", I tried to watch ""Crash"", not once, but twice, and only made it through less than a half-hour. ""Crash"" is a pretentious, fragmented mess, loaded with pretty movie stars delivering cardboard acting jobs. It disappeared from theatres ""molto pronto"", fell off the DVD sales market even faster, and despite its windfall, it will soon be forgotten completely. Yes, ""Brokeback"" was overhyped and overtalked about, but that was because of the AUDIENCE's response to it. Before it opened, the producers worried that they'd never be able to market it, but it was word-of-mouth that pushed the film over the top. You'd think that respecting its enormous, unexpected success might have occurred to the academy, since they've been trying desperately to get people back into the movie houses. Instead, they shot themselves in the foot. While ""Crash"" rehashed and reheated the old-time Hollywood racial theme, ""Brokeback Mountain"" opened up a whole new can of beans. And isn't it way past time that maintream media started lifting its opinion of gays out of the baffoonery basement? To the socially unaware, a staggering amount of adolescent suicides are directly relatable to unresolved issues of homosexuality. Why? Largely because young gay people, particulary males, have no role models. Richard Simmons? Isaac Mizrahi? Jack on ""Will & Grace""? Yes, Tommy, there are gay men who are not annoying, self-centered clowns. I won't bother mentioning all the well-known actors shamefully hiding in the closet. When will Hollywood start telling the truth about Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Proust, Henry James, Tchaicovsky, Michaelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Walt Whitman, Cole Porter, Christopher Marlowe, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, Alexander the Great, Herman Melville, Ismail Merchant, James Ivory, Dag Hammarskjold . . . Hey, how about a movie about some high school kids that instigate a Gay History Week?Whew! Okay, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is ultimately to be appreciated as a tragic love story. Romeo and Juliet can now back off. Seeing this movie is an emotional watershed, an epiphany. It confirms that art can be life-transforming.The most astonishing thing about ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the acting by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Even if you viewed this movie with no expectations as to what it was about, and even though it's at least a half-hour before Jack and Ennis become remotely sexual, the instant you see them together, you'll be struck by their chemistry. It leaps off the screen and practically sits in your lap. We see and feel immediately that there is going to be more than a buddy movie unravelling. Truly astounding. Imagine: two men in a love story, giving performances that up to now had only come from the likes of Gable and Lombard, Tracy and Hepburn, Streisand and Redford. Now that's progress! Ledger and Gyllenhaal deserved every accolade they recieved, and then some.""Brokeback Mountain"" is not a grandiose, cinematic epic. There is no overbearing music playing, there are no incredibly fancy camera shots, the actors are not made up to look like movie star gods. It is a very slow film, as it needs to be. It makes us ask ourselves ""How and why do particular people come into our lives? What is at work that randomly throws two combustable souls together?"" As I think about Jack and Ennis, haphazardly thrown together by chance, alone on a mountaintop, what are the odds that these two would find exactly what they were looking for in each other? I cannot get out of my mind this phrase: ""What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.""I love it that there are so many diverse thoughts and feelings about ""Brokeback"". Several gay men told me they were bored out of their minds, but afterwards, could not stop talking, thinking, or crying about it. Some heterosexual friends said there should have been more love scenes, others thought the utter peacefulness and boyish roughhousing between Ennis and Jack when they were alone together spoke volumes. Many told me they hadn't realized how many ""straight-acting"" homosexuals they actually knew until they were reminded by Jack and Ennis. The most bizarre comment came from Gene ""Time To Retire"" Shalit, who described Jack as a sexual predator! Try saying that about Rhett Butler, Gene!!! I myself find it interesting that while Jack initiates, Ennis then takes the reigns, and Jack willingly succumbs to him. Throughout the movie, Jack and Ennis trade ""roles"", so to speak. As in real life, nothing is a stereotype. It's also fascinating that despite Ennis supposed innocence and naivte, when push comes to shove, he instantly knows exactly how to respond to Jack's advances.The time and place of ""Brokeback Mountain"" have loaded the film with interesting subtexts. Starting in 1963 and ending in the seventies, we can't help but muse ""Is it possible these characters really existed? Is Ennis still alive? Did he ever find Jack in some wonderful hereafter?"". As many have stated already, having the story set in today's world would probably just end up like a long, complicated episode of ""Queer As Folk"". Not having to deal with AIDS, crowded gay dance clubs, gyms, and high fashion, ""Brokeback"" is able to maintain a beautiful simplicity.One of the most touching realities presented in ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the importance of holding on to a loved one's possessions, in this case, Ennis' blood-stained shirt that hangs for years in Jack's childhood bedroom, with Jack's shirt on top of it. So much emphasis is placed on the sexual aspects occurring between men, which is a actually a tiny percentage of what homosexuality is really all about. Like Jack and Ennis, anyone can determine to bed a woman, produce children, and successfully live a lie. It is the profound emotional attachment that comes before and after the sexual act that differentiates gay from straight orientation.There is another element in this film that is as universal as its love story, the element of choice, of being true to yourself. Ennis gives in to simple decisions: to be responsible to his children, to his income, to his safety. To Jack, he will only give in to maintaining a status-quo relationship. Could there be no other option, no way to find some middle-ground? He makes an easy choice, and the result is tragic. Ennis begins as a lonely, pent-up man; finds love; changes and grows; and then unwittingly throws it all away, ending up in a lonlier hell than he started in.Something there for all of us."	5.0	One for the history books	2006-01-11	6	5	1

Any filmmaker who shows me the kind of joy that these two displayed when they were together will bring me to the box office over and over again. I will bring my children and my grandchildren and my parents and my cousins and my aunts and uncles and I don't care about the sex. I want to see that joy over and over again even when I know it has to end in tragedy. In fact, the more wonderful it is, the sooner and more painful the ending has to be. If this movie has a flaw it is the heart stopping abruptness of the post card with DECEASED stamped across it. I needed some music or something to mark the occasion. To all the movie producers out there, show me the joy of loving another human being and I will make your movie a hit.	5.0	How to produce a hit	2006-03-21	31	27	4

With a year with amazing films like walk the line, capote, syriana, and Good night, and good luck.......brokeback mountain is simply just a decent movie, but not a good one.  And I think this movie could be great, but I don't feel Heath or Jake have the acting chops too pull it off.  The problem is they were acting and they didn't become the role like Joaquin Phoenix or Hoffman do.And I think the media is overhyping the gay element to make the movie sound extraordinary and groundbreaking while it's just another drama I would normally overlook without all the buzz.	2.0	not as good as it claims.......	2005-12-23	107	22	85

Ang Lee brought a simple story and made a romantic,sad,touching film. Heath and Jake were so convincing that you forget they are actors. Michelle Williams is an actress to watch in the future. After years on Dawsons Creek. She has found a place in film history. I can't wait for this film to come out on DVD.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1P1JCCFPPRNVU	"Julie Bratspis ""Jackson Julie"""	There are so many levels of this brilliant movie. Tho Heath Ledger was only 23 when he made this movie, he was completely believable as a torn apart reclusive father of a teenage daughter who has given up.  Obviously chemistry is the cornerstone of this movie, and the chemistry between all the characters was heartrending. Anne Hathaway was amazing and seemless as she became a disenfranchised wife who became cold as ice. Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant as man who is trapped in a love that is not enough and too weak to accept what there is. Michele Williams' innocence is so fragile.  The scene in the kitchen where she reveals what she knows is so painful. If I try to do a full review of this movie, I'll be up all night and Amazon wouldn't have enough room.The conversion to Blu Ray is beautiful.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A13R9SYECFK7JQ	Julie	"I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I walked into the multiplex to see the much appraised Brokeback Mountain.  I vaguely remember seeing the trailer a few weeks back, and even then didn't take much of an interest (guess the trailer didn't do it much justice).  I was trying to make myself comfortable, peering over my shoulder to have a look at the 'audience', which were pretty normal people - what the heck was I expecting!The opening scene is among the most humbly beautiful things I've seen in movies and really sets the scene for the time and place, which is Wyoming 1963.  The tension and attraction between the characters Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist is developed so realistically; I was drawn into their world from the start - the line between reality and movie magic just faded to hell because the acting here is nothing I've ever seen before and that's saying something for a 21 year old jaded to the movie screen.  These are strong men, as straight as they can get: roughly spoken cowboys straight out of an old western - the epitome of masculinity itself.Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist take up a job together one summer herding sheep up on Brokeback Mountain. It isn't long before they become great friends and soon an unexpected love developes between the two men, even though one of them, Ennis, claims ""I'm not queer"", and the look on Jack's face before he reluctantly and resignedly agrees.  At this point so early in the film, I couldn't understand why I was experiencing a physical, palpable pain in my heart.Inevitably, both of them leave Brokeback Mountain and go their separate ways, gets married (which deteriorates), have kids.  However, both are unable to forget one another, and their reunion scene (after 4 yrs) is so powerful I still have to compose myself even now just thinking about it.  That scene, and among others, such as the post-divorce reunion, where Jack mistakes Ennis's divorce as a chance for them to finally be together, driving miles just to see him.  I won't explain the rest, as no doubt most of you have seen the movie and know, so I digress...The story of Brokeback Mountain unfolds before you with great subtlety; never going down that cliched road of being over-the-top, outrageous or try to push a view onto anyone, and for that, I admire.  The almost electrifying tension between the characters is so palpable you would not believe and just proves that not all movies succeed by being loud and blunt.  It is  gentle and satisfying, yet deeply tragic.  Who knew that one look could say so much?  Not everything is for scenic purposes either: the film contains  lots of symbolism, most you might not notice until second viewing.Nothing prepares you for this achingly beautiful, honest and  profound movie that surpasses being a ""movie"", and to be frank, becomes a life force that will embed itself forever into your memory.  I may not have known what I was getting myself into when I sat down to a screening of it, but I'm sure as hell glad that I did.  Movies this good don't come along often.For those who berate the movie because either they reckon it promotes infidelity or because they, like the media, typecast it as being the 'gay cowboy movie': put aside your biases for a damned second.  Brokeback is first and foremost a story about love, about things that we humans never get around to doing and the regrets that ensue furthur down the line when yes, we realize (in the very words of Jack Twist) that ""there ain't  never enough time, never enough."""	5.0	Movies this good don't come along often	2006-04-29	56	47	9

"I will start by saying Ang Lee's directing is another subject, as it is one of the most stunningly filmed movies I have ever seen. I don't believe that making this movie was brave, as someone has also said before. You don't have to be brave to tell a story you know is very good, fictional or not. I do believe, however, that one is brave in watching it. You don't have to be gay or straight to have curiosity about the movie, and I think either side would have their preconcieved ideas disappointed. It is also, in my opinion, one of the most terrifying movies I have seen in my entire life, aside from the first time I saw (the original) ""The Omen."" If you have ever loved someone in your life, or let a feeling pass by without its communication - you will know what I mean by this. By the end of this movie, every one of those moments will come heaping down upon you, and you will understand the magic of the story. Watch this movie, and you will find yourself in one of the characters. Watch it and it will tell you something about yourself. The real story is about the chances we've taken or lost to find real, unspeakably pure happiness.It is a love story, but this time it is not impossible. *That* is terrifying."	5.0	If you think you're brave - you'll watch it.	2006-06-19	46	39	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AZVJGNDLE4U1W	Just Jeff	I didn't feel a need to review this movie because there are plenty of positive reviews. From the reviews (all 900 of them) it is apparent that you either love this movie or hate it. There is a lot of gushing by the 5-star-ers. The negative reviewers say it's boring and bizarre. I think both camps are missing the point. I grew up in rural Utah, which is similar to rural Wyoming. I relate to the poverty of life and poverty of feeling. Rural guys in this area really do act like those in the movies. They mumble and don't talk much. The interaction between two guys who aren't well acquainted is often mostly just avoidance. The initial sex scene was very believable. These guys really needed an excuse to show their feelings. The alcohol and freezing cold broke down their inhibitions. They crumbled suddenly like a fortress built on sand. The pacing of the story fits the rural pace of life. They were so oppressed by their upbringing and environment that their infrequent trysts in the wilds was actually very brave. That they finally let circumstances crush them is very depressing. This really is a sad movie without a lot of joy. But that often is how life is.	5.0	A Happy Movie Would Be Sad	2006-06-06	53	47	6

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3NKMDRJIB1NGD	Jutta	I skipped this movie at the theatre. Gay cowboys, what a weird idea I thought. Some remarks of friends of mine made me curious, so I gave it a try. What can I say?Ang Lee did a great job, portraying these two guys in love. He did it so masterfully that I totally forgot that the two leadings are men. It appeared so natural, that I felt, that they were made for each other and no one else. Ang Lee is simply a genius.The acting is another strength of this movie. Roberta Maxwell as Jake's mother is perfect. Look at her facial expressions when she realizes who Ennis is. You can see her pain, when Ennis leaves, because she knows that another part of her son is gone now forever. Absolutely heartbreaking.Ledger did most challenging job and he was definitely the right one to do it. Who would have ever thought what a great actor he is? He played this Ennis del Mar so perfectly and nuanced that you actually think he IS Ennis del Mar! Bravo! I will never forget the scene, when he asks his daughter, if her husband loves her. Just for a few seconds you can see all his sorrow and regret in his face. I had tears in my eyes.Bokeback Mountain is one the saddest but at the same time one the most beautiful movies I have seen in my life. If you see it and like it, I encourage you to watch it twice.

Just because it was the first of its kind or different does not automatically make it any good. Another year of the awards season and another year of great disappointment. Million Dollar Baby last year started the downward slide for me. Everyone talked about it but it really wasn't that good.  Same with this movie BB. For purely entertainment value it has no substance. My wife personally hates any movie that advocates cheating on your spouse behind their back so that does make her a little biased.So from an entertainment value perspective, this movie just doesn't perform. It is a good one to maybe rent for a few dollars, but if you buy it (and you actually have a taste for entertainment), then you will be greatly dissapointed.	2.0	Not So Good	2006-03-21	137	15	122

I'm not in a hurry to see it at the theater, I would much rather see it at home. I was shocked simply because of all the hype which left me with a completely different idea of what the movie was really about, but after reading the book, all of the clips I've seen and the reviews I've read, now make much more sense. I'm sure many other folks have the same idea of the ""Queer Cowboy Movie"", but if the movie is anywhere near Annie's story, I just could not sit quietly in a theater and have my heart wrenched and twisted.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A33NMQ80MGVE0G	"Kalandra L. Dowdy ""Kalandra Dowdy"""	I have simply fallen in love with this film!!! Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal were absolutely phenomenal!!! These two amazing gentlemen captured human emotions & feelings so fantastically I cannot explain. Heath was exceptional as Ennis! He just brought the character to life and made us understand where he was coming from and how difficult it was for him to accept what he was feeling, wanting, and going through. Heath comes across as a stubborn man who doesn't want to accept what he feels for Jake. One of my favorite scenes is when he and Jake say goodbye and Jake's looking at him walk away through the car side mirror. Then Heath's character shows how he feels when he is kneeling down in the barn house and is huffing and puffing and crying because he's so confused, angry, and sad about what's he's feeling inside and because Jake and him just said goodbye. The kissing scenes and the scenes of them lying down together were magnificent. Although the scenes had something to do with sexuality they also had to do with human release and being at peace and ease with another human soul. There was so much art and beauty shown in this film that you can't help but watch it again and again. The maturity and depth shown in this movie is outstanding. I give both Jake & Heath props for their incredible portrayal of two human souls in the most beautiful and realistic way. This film has made me an even bigger fan of both Heath & Jake. I respect them and their talent so much now. I must also admit that seeing them together was a bit of a turn on for me not only because they are two handsome hotties. But also because they portrayed the male species in a more humanly beautiful way than I have ever seen on film. Although Heath seemed so angry and hard to get through to you could understand why and what made him act that way. Some may look at some of the scenes when they're fighting and see them as violent. But for me I saw it as the venting of confusion that they both were feeling and going through. I mean Heath's character was brought up to be some kind of a tough guy and manly man. So when Heath's character Ennis starts to have feelings for Jake's character Jack this ignites Ennis's state of confusion and unwillingness to accept what he's feeling inside. It's like he wants this thing inside of him to go away but he can't control it. It seems to me like that makes him more and more withdrawn through the film and more unable to express himself. He wants to deny what is happening but can't deny his feelings for Jake's character. I really enjoyed this film because it was so mature and so real. I also loved Michelle Williams's portrayal of Ennis's devastated wife. She was right on the money in every scene. I also loved Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife. You could sense what Anne was feeling in a single facial expression! All and all the actors were great. The feel of the film was so real and intense.

The performances of Heath (sigh) as Ennis and Jake as Jack, along of course w/Ang Lee's masterful direction, are terrific.  The screenplay by Mr. McMurtry and Ms. Ossana is perfect.  The fact of Ennis & Jack not being together effects their entire lives, as well as the lives around them.

It tore my heart asunder, and I found myself weeping uncontrollably, as I put the DVD back into the player and watched it for a second time. What impressed me the most was, being a woman, and always having men friends, I yearned for a relationship like that between Ennis and Jack, only to realize that such a thing was ONLY possible between 2 men. Because they understood each other so completely. Could I be like that...sure..but because I am a woman, men only see that fact. It made me heartsick. lonely, and also incredibly joyous that such a connection could be possible. Does this make sense?	5.0	The best love story, ever	2014-01-11	4	3	1

Strong dramatic performances from all and a great tribute to Heath Ledger's work. He died far too young. Ang Lee tackles the subject of two gay men falling in love in the rural 60's and how things actually were back then with tenderness and brutal honesty. A great, and in my humble option, much needed, piece of work.~AJTexas, US	5.0	Amazing Love Story, Great Writing, Awesome Secenery...	2009-08-02	12	11	1

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A16NLLOU291I85	Katie	"Hollywood comes up with an endless string of movies every year. Some are (involuntarily) funny, some are spectacular, some scary... However most of them are meaningless - expensive wrapping for zero content, characters by the book, tiny obstacles and the foreseeable happy ending. Only every once in a while does Hollywood give us a movie that lasts, a movie depicting fates that rock our world even outside the theatres.Those stories happen to be romances mostly. And interestingly, the ones that touch us the most, are the ones that don't happen.  My list of all time favourite Hollywood couples: Rick and Ilsa, Karen von Blixen and Denys Finch Hatton and of course Rose and Jack - not one happy couple! I don't even want to know why that is...Anyways, Hollywood just added another couple to that hall of fame. Their names - Enis and Jack - might not be as well known as their predecessors' yet, but they sure earned their place among them.""Brokeback Mountain"", better known as the ""gay Western"", is really a love story. The two cowboys Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist get teamed up for a summer job guarding sheep on Brokeback Mountain in 1963. Up there under a wide sky, they fall in love. Hesitating at first but then all the more violently. The end of the summer also seems to be the end of their romance. Both go back to their civil lives, get married, father children. But they meet again and again for two decades trying to cling to that long lost summer. As in all the great love stories they don't end up together.So what was there about a ""gay Western""? Actually, the intense performance by Ledger and Gyllenhaal makes you forget that this is a same sex relationship. The longing and pain they show are so immediate, they become universal. The spectator physically hurts.Rick and Ilsa couldn't be together for the good cause's sake, Ennis and Jack are separated by the conventions of a prude society. But despite all obstacles, the two cowboys share a few moments of happiness and thanks to Ang Lee's divine direction, we get to share them, too. So no matter what Hollywood comes up with next, we'll always have Brokeback Mountain."	5.0	An affair to remember	2006-03-11	44	38	6

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AA5SPT6Y3YW57	"K. A. Turner ""LoveistheOnlyLaw"""	"Thank you very much to everyone who opened themselves up to a firestorm in order to do a wonderful, heart-changing thing; some who challenged themselves and their own pain by going to see this film, some who challenged upbringing or the catcalls and judgment of friends and family to do the same, and those who challenged themselves all the more by taking the initiative to write honestly and openly about how this movie/story affected you.  It is always difficult and a risk to share a difficult and eye-opening personal experience; but doing so challenges us all; and it's the folks that dare to do these things that will change the world for the better; this simple willingness to inspect the true root of our beliefs, separate out what we've been taught from what we find truly affecting and related to our own experience.Movies like this one (read, movies that speak of real human emotion and the real daily tragedies of human experience; and movies that let us FEEL these emotions, tragedies, and experiences rather than telling us what to feel in words) are rare in this market of stupid comedies and explosions...rare especially in broader 'market cinema'.  But when they do get out there, break out of the 'indie movie' circuit and become more readily accessible, if they can change even one person's life, then my hopes for the world are affirmed.  Many condemn these movies as a knee-jerk, without even knowing wherefrom they speak...they 'KNOW' the movie is 'evil' because they 'KNOW' it...not because they challenged themselves in any way to actually SEE it first.  Indeed, I doubt many of these folks who are so vehemently against the so-called 'gay agenda' went to see ""Brokeback"" or ""Transamerica"", or they might realize that the only agenda most of us have is to be loved, respected, and treated as human beings.Granted, many cities didn't show these movies, meaning that folks who WANTED to see them in some areas would have had to drive or fly to another city to do so--proving once and for all that our 'elected' officials think of us as children to be 'protected' from ourselves rather than simply giving us the choice to watch something or not, but that is a whole other rant.  But it is my belief that no one should have an opinion on something they haven't seen/experienced for themselves, or at least tried to put themselves in those shoes for a moment or two.  Experiences cannot be judged, because no one but the experiencer has any idea what the heck they're talking about; and if anything has actually been experienced by someone, then it is as valid as any other experience.  I cannot judge the validity of the effect that any experience has had on another person's life; I can only judge my own...but it is the fact that, upon discussion, so many people had such a similar experience with this film that makes me feel that we really all have a great deal more in common than we might believe; as much as the experience might have touched us for different reasons...for we are all different.  Thank God.Speaking of wonderful variety, I too would have liked to see more variety in the awards. This has been a great year for movies, with many making very important points (which in my world means moviemaking at its best; using the power of the screen to reach out and make people THINK...even if some would prefer to spend their money on trashy, big-budget remakes that don't strain their faculties or comfort zones at all). ""Munich"" and ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and perhaps ""Crash"" certainly deserve more awards.  But all in all it's been a very intelligent movie year; and a year with a whole BUNCH of standouts makes it hard to get a good spread on the awards.Still, part of me is also elated. Who would have thought a film like ""Brokeback"" would have made it to eight nominations in any show in the US? (Or that ""Transamerica"" would win anything in this country?!) The fact that they can even be shown in mainstream theaters in this country--whatever the limitations put on circulation--rather than being restricted to the 'arthouse' circuit as they once would have been shows how far we've come. And when I saw ""Brokeback"", three times thus far in the week since it's gotten enough buzz to actually leave the 'safe' cities for the second tier, there were a lot of straight men wearing western attire there with their wives...and people came out thoughtful and moved. And that right there is a testament to how we're FINALLY, if slowly, growing as a society. It's the first thing in a long time that's given me hope that the USA might actually get back to what was once great about it, and maybe even live up to its great potential after all...as a country where, one hopes, someday everyone will be safe and free to live and love without needing to harm anyone else to *feel* safe...instead of just talking about it.I have now seen this movie three times, and wish I could see it more; for each time, I have found something different; deeper, more heart-wrenching...and in the end, salving.  I have seldom seen a movie whose cinematography, writing, music, casting, editing, direction, production, setting, and overall feel were so in tune.  ""Dances With Wolves"" springs to mind.  Day-Lewis and Stowe's ""Last of the Mohicans"".  And yes, oh yes, although this one came at a time when the movie could not be as brave as ""Brokeback"" with its adaptation, ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", beside which ""Brokeback"" has its rightful place reserved on my shelf, as the novella stands beside ""Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe"" on my shelf of literary masterpieces.  Because in the end it's not about the make-up for the necessary but difficult 'aging', not about why Gyllenhall is called a 'supporter', why Hathaway didn't get recognized as much as Williams...but about the EXPERIENCE...and how it changed every one of us who saw it.  I cannot wait for the deleted scenes sure to be on the DVD (as evidenced by dialogue and scenes not seen in the theatrical release but shown or heard in the trailers), hoping that with more Jack and Ennis, I might get just one more tiny clue more as to WHY...and maybe even...'someday'.For this reason, I went to find the novella, and read it in minutes, starving for meaning; driven by the pain...and the reluctant beauty.  For this reason I went back and back again; and as many have said, the first time, the ending shattered me, the few moments of dialogue staggered me (""And then you tell me you'll kill me for needin' something I hardly never git!  I wish I knew how to quit you!""  ""Then why don't you?  You're the reason I am the way I am!  I have nothin', I am nothin'...""  and the terrible catharsis of ""You aren't nothing.  I love you,"" still unspoken...and the image of what has been lost because in that time and place, it simply could not be had.  The second time, the music stepped out as a star, where in the first viewing, it was so much a part of the experience that I didn't hear it so much as *felt* it.  Now every time I hear that music, those few beautifully spare, painful, poignant chords of lonely guitar, I see Ennis holding the shirts, looking at the postcard, and I cry as I haven't cried in or at a movie since I forced myself to stop crying at anything, at age six, for similar reasons to Ennis's, though in a much different situation.  And in the last time, while still shattered, I even managed to find a kind of peace with the finality of the ending; and the faint breath of hope, like air, that breaks into the terrible self-imposed claustrophobia of the final image of Ennis Del Mar; still with his love and pain in the literal closet...but now able to cry, and promise Jack what he could not in life.  ""I know better now; we would have lost anyway.  But at least we wouldn't have lost the years, too; and what might have been before this end.""A movie with a message that, like the protestations of love that so many feel are necessary to *portray* love, connection, loss...did not need narration to worm its way into the hearts of everyone watching, gay, straight, or self-challenging; a message and moment and music that haunts long after the movie ends, and demands another viewing just to try to get it right in one's head.  ""WHY did it have to be this way?""  Because it WAS.Therefore I also cannot wait for for the Oscars tonight to see if true Artistry and pure experience will win out over market value and the battle of the hype about a movie that is not really *about* being gay, and that finally pokes holes in a stereotype (the Western Man, the Cowboy, not the gay man or the ex-gay) that badly needed some air let in to reality.  Monolithic status and unrealistic pedestals do no one any good, as no one who is human can live up to such standards, which have nothing to do with reality and the real human condition.  I feel justified in saying these things having been raised in a place much like 'Signal Wyoming'; Crouch Idaho, home of a rodeo ground and only 600 cowboys, where the only way out was bullriding or logging for Boise Cascade, and the teen pregnancy rate was the highest in the US, and grinding poverty was the norm, and lack of education celebrated as a cultural plaudit.  These things became part of my bones; the bleakness of that life, all the things I was so desperate to escape.  Now it is gone, and in its place are a new generation of people who have never worked so hard for so little in their lives, moved to 'God's Country' to 'go country', and think that putting on the hat and boots and listening to Garth Brooks makes them 'cowboys' who have a right and the authority to comment on the portrayal of a lifestyle they really know nothing about.  No true cowboy or ranch hand that I ever met, be it sheep or cattle or horses, would walk into any building without taking their hats off.  They didn't *talk* about being cowboys, try to prove it.  they simply were.  Them I respect, despite my reservations about the lifestyle.  I do not respect the grand mass of folks who talk about this movie as if they know what they are talking about, for most of them didn't even bother to watch it...and most of them have never met a TRUE cowboy.  If they did, they'd learn something about shooting off at the mouth when you don't know nothin' about the life.I've gotten a bit far afield here, but I'll come back to the beginning long enough to thank everyone in here once more for their willingness to stick it out there...both to allow the film to work in you in whatever way it was meant to in your personal journey and experience, and for your willingness to share that experience with others so that we all might be enriched in our own experiences.  With discussion comes learning; and IMO, that's what we're here for...to learn from each other and in that way find greater Understanding and Love.I'll close with the following quote:""Some people might be amazed to discover that other people can be spiritually-minded, and yet not use their spiritual vocabulary.""This quote helps me to try to live the tolerance that I request from others.  Since our spiritual vocabulary, as with any of our vocabularies, comes from our worldly experience (of sprituality, the world, life, etc), and each experience is different, therefore the vocabularies we use to describe those experiences to each other *must* in fact be different.  And as language is worldly, it is inherently inaccurate for such experiences...but as it is the only tool we have to share such things, we must use that gift from God and discuss, Discuss, DISCUSS!!!May love and wonder work within us ALL."	5.0	Cowboys and men who still take their hats off...and a story of terror and courage.	2006-03-05	34	28	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	MOVIE: When a movie has generated as much public interest as this one has, it's hard to go into the film with an open mind. Homosexuality has never been explored in a film in a dramatic way, it has always been comedic. While the love in this film is between two males, it doesn't detract the heterosexual viewer from the film. The story is genuine and it works on every level. Two young men find summer work by herding sheep atop Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. After spending lots of time alone in the wilderness a friendship is born that leads to a passion for one another. The movie's time span is several years, and personally I think the way it was done wasn't the best choice.. Everything happens so fast. One summer they are atop Brokeback Mountain, and then all of a sudden it's half a year later. The audience is closed off to the rest of the characters' lives from point to point. So the story focuses only when they meet back together to head back up and spend time together. For me, that pacing didn't work. It doesn't hurt the film overall, but I think the emotional impact could have been greater if we focused on a more detailed look into the characters. What Ang Lee does with this film is bring an immense appreciation for the setting and the surroundings. Cinematography is a sure win come Oscar night for Brokeback Mountain. Ang Lee takes the time to stop and look at the beauty of nature and how it envelopes the characters in this paradise from the rest of civilization and the rest of their lives. This forbidden love soon starts to work against them when word gets out. Relationships with their wives are shattered, and society shuns them, which leads to the very emotional ending. It doesn't matter if your gay or not, the film is made in a way that allows it to be accepted by any audience. The film is very well done, but I was not fond of the jumpy storyline where we skip ahead a few months or a year every now and then.ACTING: Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give great performances, but I don't think it's going to win them any Oscar gold. Michelle Williams gives an amazing performance as Ledger's outcast wife, who ultimately uncovers his secret life. The acting is top notch, all of them do fine work.BOTTOM LINE: When I go into a film like this I expect an emotional punch to get the audience really involved, however it may be hard for everyone to find an emotional connection with this movie. I was not as moved as when I saw character driven films like Million Dollar Baby or The Station Agent. The characters are fleshed out and they feel real, and that is what may make this the frontrunner for Oscar's Best Picture.	4.0	An Amazing Film With Real Characters & Brilliant Cinematography	2006-01-18	6	1	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2P0CHR2KVAY47	"Kayla P. ""The Magnificent"""	"After watching this movie I have become convinced that good movies are a thing of the past. This is a truly ridiculous movie. I'm not talking about subject matter as far themes go. The story is rather unbelievable, and frankly, I just couldn't feel sorry for two men who cheated on their wives, and neglected their children for what, 20 years? Also I found the dialogue and special effects to be quite laughable, the worst example being the fake looking glued on beards used to age the characters.On th e upside, the cinematography and scenery were quite beautiful.  Also, I couldn't understand how this movie was promoted by gay advocates since this movie seems to promote negative stereotypes of gays. I couldn't understand why, if the characters were in such deep ""love"", Jake's character cheated on Heath's character with a prostitute in Mexico. I think this movie, as a whole, was unsatisfying, and could have been much better.  I REALLY couldn't understand how this movie was given so many positive reviews and touted so much in the media.

It will survive as long as there is a thinking and intelligent audience for fim. Definitely one to have on DVD as it becomes richer with each viewing. I noticed so much more the second time I saw it; from the sheer poverty of these two young guys; with Ennis saving his half smoked cigarette and worrying so much about the loss of a shirt and Jack Twist's tough home background. Exceptionally good performances all round - fantastic direction, writing and music. It's sad that its detractors  cannot relate to it's compassion and power . It was robbed of the best movie Oscar - but it's in very good company there. Would like to see a special DVD with the ORIGINAL trailer which was also exceptional.

The 3 Academy Awards it won, the love story, the gorgeous mountain scenery, the incredible acting.  BUZZZZZZ. I don't think so! I'm a hopeless romantic and found this movie TERRIBLE! The movie was slow. The acting wasn't that great, with the exception of Michelle Williams, who was outstanding. There wasn't enough of a buildup to make the first, very graphic encounter believable. I think that scene was way over the top and was in it for Hollywood shock value. As for the musical score, it was the same 8-10 notes over and over again. Although I'm straight, I absolutely see nothing wrong with not being straight, whether bi or gay, which I'm sure that's what some of you might think. I truly think the only reason this won awards was because it was so out there... no matter how bad the movie was.  I continue to be Heath and Jake's fan, but not from this one!

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AD4M6R776Z31L	Kenneth S. Wheelock	"I was extraordinarily disappointed at the failure of nerve displayed by AMPAS at the Oscar's Ceremony to give so many Oscars to such less deserving ""winners.""  Brokeback Mountain deals with so many of life's profound mysteries on so many different levels it is hard to summarize it in a short review.  Heath Ledger, whose creativity in bringing Ennis del Mar to life monumentally surpasses the achievement of any other actor in 2005, was upstaged by an actor who was recognized merely for his ability to impersonate.  At least BAFTA recognized Jake Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance as Jack Twist.  ""Best Picture"" Crash deals with issues of racism.  Would racism be an issue if everyone were treated equally regardless of race? Gender?  No one chooses to be born different from everybody else.  No one chooses to be born disadvantaged, handicapped, or gay.  Regardless of what we are born with, we make of life what we can and we play the cards we are dealt. The tragedy of life is that some of us play our cards better than others and clearly some of us are dealt better hands than others.  Thats what makes Brokeback Mountain timeless - Ennis and Jack had no choice in who they were, who they loved or when and how they discovered they were different and this movie reflects that poignantly, beautifully, tenderly and with a quiet honest respect for its subject.  Here in 2005 we think we have more choices, but clearly the reaction to this movie indicates many people are still as crippled emotionally today as people were in 1963.  Growth comes slowly and emotional growth is fraught with pain.  All of us can look back at choices made and regretted.  Annie Proulx said she wrote her short story about homophobia.  She did, but like all great art it was predicated on an underlying truth: love is a force of nature.  Ang Lee, Diana Ossana, Larry McMurtry and everyone who worked on this movie transformed a New Yorker short story into one of the centuries' epic morality tales.  It is not a morality tale for red or blue states, heterosexuals or homosexuals; it is not a morality tale of what is right or wrong - its moral is love or die, and the corollary to that moral is God gives you no choice in whom you love because we are commanded to love everyone as yourself.  If we all did that this movie would never have been made.  It is worth seeing over and over and over again.  This movie will be on the 100 best list for centuries."	5.0	Truly Love is a Force of a Nature	2006-03-13	46	42	4

For the story, it was good and touching, I almost cried out like I watched ""Titanic"" almost 10 years ago.  For the acting, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal have perfect acting for this movie.  Others are also good in this particular movie.  For the direction, it is perfect, Ang Lee.  I know that this movie maybe quite ambitious, but it turns out to be good.  So, it is a good one.  For the visuals, it is okay as it is not like a real action.  It is about touching love and romance, so it is kind of not applicable here.  For the music, I feel so enjoyable as I hear the music in the middle of the scenes because they are so relaxing.  For the sound effects, it is good too.

My perception is that both Ennis and Jack ""are"" bisexual, but find wide disagreement on this question with various critics claiming they are straight, bisexual or gay. Similarly, we experience the circumstances of Jack's death as a feared uncertainty rather than something we can attach a label to (""accident"", ""hate crime"", etc). This stylistic approach reinforces the power of the story by letting us feel the excruciating uncertainty of a life that is loved but cannot be shared.Otherwise, the natural scenery is unbelievable, beautiful mountains, animals, rivers, men (!), etc.Watch this film!"	5.0	Amazing	2009-07-05	10	9	1

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M	Kevin Currie-Knight	"Those are the last three words spoken in Brokeback Mountain, the tear-jerker directed by Ang Lee and starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhaal. (Don't worry; I am not going to say any more about the ending.) Ever since I've heard those last three words - and I've heard them twice - it has been hard to extract them, and all that leads up to them, out of my head.Brokeback Mountain may look, on first blush, to be a 'gay cowboy' film. Believe me when I - and other reviewers - tell you that it is infinitely more than that. It is a story of two people (yes, of the same sex) who are hopelessly in love....in secret. Jack Twist is the sensitive and optimistic one. Ennis Del Mar is the quintessential cowboy - the silent and guarded one. When thse two meet in '63 on Brokeback Mountain, they do not realize how each will change and help shape the other for the better part of the next 20 years.If you are only familiar with Heath Ledger as the Aussie sex symbol of Cassanova and A Knight's Tale, then you have only seen part of him. His evocation of Ennis Del Mar are spectacular. While it is too early in this young actors career to go too far out on a limb, I predict that when all is said and done, this may be the role he is known for! It is obivous that he knows this character well. This is not to discount Jake Gyllenhaal's perfect-fit performance as Jack Twist. It is just to say that Jack lacks the delicate nuances of Ennis.The cinematography is fantastic! If you are reading this review, then you have probably missed your chance to see this on the big screen and that is a shame. Whatever you do, see this on a nice, big, widescreen tv. The shots of the Wyoming (actually, Canadian) landscape are awesome, and match the film's emotional beauty with physical beauty.As said, this film is about a 20 year love affair that tests its characters to their limits. Two characters are forced to come to grips with their homosexuality (bisexuality?) in a time, place, and occupation that does not allow such a thing. They must keeep the identity of their one true love a secret from their female lovers, who can't help but pale in comparison. It is love story that is (unlike every other love story) not at all cliche as it adds this extra dimension.Yes, the film is a character film and as such, it moves slow. It is approximately 2 1/2 hours but - at least to my eyes - this is time well spent. Every minute of this film is there for a reason; to give you as true and unadulterated a glimpse into these two characters as is possible. The dialogue is sparse (as most dialogue between cowboys - private people - is). Alas, it is all worth it.""Jack, I swear..."" Everything culminates into these three lines. Did tears run down my face? You bet; both times. Will tears run down yours? I don't know, but don't you think it is worth finding out?"	5.0	"""Jack, I swear...."""	2006-04-10	65	53	12

Romeo and Juliet, and Brokeback Mountain.The story allows people a peak into the hidden, but ugly side of society that still exist today. Yet even through the tragedy, it portrayed love to its finest.Definitely a film worth watching.	5.0	Best Romance Story Since Romeo and Juliet	2006-05-28	26	19	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1JOFF9RRRBTTP	Kevin O'Connel	The biggest difference between Western Movies and Eastern Movies is probably that, while Eastern Movies shows turn of events, conflicts, and survival by clinging to the soul, Western Movie are mostly just Laughs, Anger, Fear, or Tears. Rarely are messages so woven into the movie that it cannot be understood, only felt. So I was quite surprised when I saw two major Western Movie stars acting out a movie that is so delicate. This movie, obviously, moved my very spirit, but I was more surprised to find that the western society is able to produce a movie with such degrees of beauty. Perhaps there are still hopes for the movie industry after all.	5.0	Is This Really a Western Movie?	2006-06-03	32	24	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1F2EYORWOZ3G1	"Kevin Stanton ""stanke36"""	I was hesitant about this movie for one reason. From the previews I saw I figured it depicted gay men in a negative light by getting married and eventually hurting the women and children they belonged to. But I was wrong.This movie isn't about that. It is about love, plain and simple.There aren't the descriptives here to express the ability this movie has to move you.The acting is stellar from all. The story is excellent and carried out very well on screen. The cinematography is breathtaking at times and the music truly reflects the mood.The basic theme of this movie is that love will strike in it's own time, and with whomever it deems is 'the one'. The love that struck the two main characters here was taboo and they do the best they can to quell the fire within them. When the realization hits that it's bigger than the mountain they met on they meet throughout the rest of their lives to satiate the need they have for each other.The angst, confusion, identity issues and all the other problems that would go with a 'taboo' love are what carry this movie.An unlikely forerunner in the award category, this movie is destined to be a classic. It has all the right elements.If you have been hesitant to watch this movie because of the theme do yourself a favor.... rent it and watch it. It has a lot to say about life and love.	5.0	An immediate classic!	2006-05-26	20	18	2
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1W661TC1P6VQI	"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi..."	"Every year the world gets at least one controversial film that is hailed by critics, and usually wins a lot of awards. ""Brokeback Moutain"" has been labled as ""the gay cowboy movie,"" which sounds about right to me. It may be me, but I'm more likely to side with the hecklers in this case then with the critics. When ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" came out the critics hailed it as a ""revolutionary film,"" one that apparently was so good that it was said that ""it [didn't] matter whether you were left or right, [""Fahrenheit 9/11""] is a great film."" Of course, we all know these statements to be complete lies barely two years later.But maybe the critics are right in this case. Maybe ""Brokeback Moutain"" IS a movie that can change the way we think about gay lovers?! I went into the movie with an open mind, ready to have my beliefs challenged. Strangely enough, I can sum up what ""Brokeback Moutain"" is in brief, simple summery: ""Brokeback Moutain"" is a glorified affair. As you all know, ""Brokeback Moutain"" revolves around two sheep herders (Ennis and Jack) who get drunk, have sex, and (supposingly) fall in love. Then they get back to the real world, they both get married, they have kids, but they still remember the nights they shared on Brokeback Mountain.Then one day, Ennis receives a letter from Jack, suggesting that they go back to Brokeback Moutain for another fling (although he doesn't say it like that per se). They both know that they can never be together, but they do make a choice to keep seeing each other at Brokeback Mountain every few months. Through the years Ennis and Jack spend continue with their real lives, with those few days a year they can see each other when they are in total bliss. All the while they hurt their wives, they neglect their kids to a certain extent, and they hurt friends.Some people see this movie as a great tradgedy because these two men love each other but can't be together. I, on the other hand, saw two men who lusted for each other, and ended up being complete jerks who did nothing but cheat on their wives and have no problem with this. Ok, time for the sarcasm to end and it's time to get serious. Despite all the praise this film gets, despite all the things that are being said about this series, at the end of the day this is about two men having an affair and hurting the people they are married to. This fact seems to have went over almost everyone's head. The fact that these two characters are hurting their loved one's doesn't seem to matter much to the people praising this film.I have to wonder, if the coupld had been a man and a woman, would all this deception and cheating be as overlooked as it is here? It's also hard to believe in the romance itself, seeing as how it was birthed from a night where the characters had one too many drinks, not because they actually fall in love. They just have a hard night of sex and before you know it they're a couple. Sorry, but I'm not convinced. Throughout this whole film there was only one believable character in the whole movie, and that character is the Michelle Williams character. When Williams character discovers that her husbend is cheating on her, we truly feel sorry for her as her marriage falls apart.The scene where she finally confronts her husbend about his affair with another man, I almost started to cry for her, as she was outright lied to, and her life was, more or less, greatly damaged. For some reason, some of the people I saw the film with sided with Ennis during this scene, because the Williams character ""didn't understand what Ennis was going through."" I couldn't help but wonder what any of the other characters had to do to get sympathy. The boys boss (played by Randy Quade) has been said to be a biggot, when in reality he couldn't care less about the two boys sexuality, he's just mad that they let his sheep get eaten while they were keeping themselves busy.I will admit that the acting is good, and the cinatography is beautiful, but I can't in all honesty recommend a movie where the main characters seem to okay with hurting people they care about, with very few consequences. I've never cared about movies that are about glorified affairs, and this one is no different."	1.0	"""Brokback Mountain"": A Glorified Affair"	2006-01-10	181	61	120

""Kimberly"""	"I orginally saw this movie expecting it to live up to all the hype such as being told it was ""one of the movies that will change the cinema forever."" The movie itself is simplistic seen from a casual observer. You see the forbidden love/romance but, I was not convince that the love between Jack & Ennis was geniune you really see a few moments between here and there that make you feel as though they have a love connection- but the moments are so brief you cannot real see the true connection between the two.The movie taps into gay issues- such as hidden romance- not being able to reveal your ""true self"" or being misunderstood in society. For that the movie might change the cinema forever- making more movies that relate to gay romance/gay romance more accepted(because how it is NOT accepted in society in the movie).Ledger does an amazing job as Ennis a man torn between his own wants and what others expect of him. Both men do have families- and the beginning of both marriages seem almost like a sham or something that would have NEVER worked out regardless of how much either partner tired. The wives are portrayed as cold, non-responsive, and un-thoughtful... leading to perhaps that DIRE need Ennis & Jack have to be together and retreat to the place they intially fell in love ""Brokeback Mountain.""But, I seriously doubt that ""Brokeback Mountain"" will be here for generations or become the classic of this decade like ""Titanic"" or ""Casablanca"" will always live on. The truth is the movie has recieved the hype not for the movie itself but mainly the story matter- never has a gay romance movie gone mainstream or been accepted for that fact ""Brokeback Mountain"" will shape the history of the cinema and the United States. But, I highly doubt that future generations will look upon the movie as a ""classic"" but, more as a meer stepping stone in politics and society's views.If you don't want to see the movie for religious reasons or for personal beliefs than just don't see it- The movie will NOT convert or convince anyone to change their lifestyle or change their own views and truth is anyone who is against homo-sexuality for personal or religious reasons will NOT see the movie. All in all if you like simple romances and expect a simple movie/with simple concepts than you will enjoy this movie... hopeful this is just a drop in the bucket for future films/the country."	3.0	Not Worth The Hype-	2006-05-02	32	8	24

In my part of the world, BBM never played at our movie house. I had to travel over 3 years one way to see it firsthand. I sat alone in the dark theater for the 2+ hours watching every frame of this beautiful film thinking that when I left things would never been quite the same again.  I was right. The film is a whole world of emotions..love, hate, fear, pride, saddness, longing, lust, anger and many many others all wrapped up in one. The story is very very real. Trust me...I know the story by heart having lived most of it.  The actors are beyond excellent as is the story and script. Ang Lee's direction is pure art unto it's self.BBM is a film that will always haunt you once you see it.  Many months after seeing it I still find myself (more than once a day) thinking about it and rolling it over in my mind. It is not about being ""gay"".  It is about life. Plain and simple. Everyone loves, hurts, laughs, cries, etc.  The sex of the characters is just window dressing. Being gay does however add more salt to the wounds the subjects of BBM must face.  I think this film will hopefully change the way the ""real"" world sees all gay persons. I think Lee and the writers made sure of it with a piece of work that touches all who see it.It is a VERY hard film to watch...But you should. It will make you think and make you feel. When Jack is murdered and Ennis is finally told. No one with any amount of heart in their body or soul should be able watch and not feel the need to either turn away or cry.

Ennis (a flooring Ledger) and Jack (a very good Gyllenhaal) are constantly at odds with the constructs of their society, and as a result, their relationship remains perpetually thwarted; the realization that they need each other in the most primal way stymied.

The tragedy of Brokeback Mountain ultimately lies in the failure between Ennis and Jack to reconcile their desires for one another, and it is the moment of recognition on the part of the former that marks the film's soaring emotional crescendo, the power of which is only deepened by the sense of loss that precedes it.

But really, that is only the surface of what this film is truly about. At its core, Brokeback is a romance that focuses on repressed love, longing, and the struggles of relationships. For these reasons, I believe that it can be relatable to anyone, gay or straight. It is also a film about acceptance--and the pressures society places on all individuals to conform to whatever is considered ""normal."" These are obstacles that we all face in today's world--and this film sends a powerful message about the need to respect all people (even if they are different from ourselves).The performances by Heath and Jake are extraordinary, the scenery is fantastic, and Gustavo Santaolalla's score is beautifully haunting. The love, pain, and desire that all of the characters feel is completely believable; I hope that this film is given major attention at Oscar time.I would highly recommend this film, but it is certainly not for everyone. Open-mindedness is a must!!! Also, a warning: Expect to leave the theater feeling like you've been shot through the heart...and expect this film to stay with you for a very long time afterward!"	5.0	Like a shot through the heart...	2006-01-01	19	16	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2ZFAYA9NKP2SA	LadyArmand	Annie Proulx did something other's thought was impossible when she sat down and wrote the Spartanly written, yet beautifully haunting and heartbreaking short story Brokeback Mountain; she reinvented the American Cowboy.  She gave that distinctly American icon a whole knew sensibility and dimension here to date unheard of or at least not talked about out in the open.  Some have venerated her for it, while others have called what she wrote and act of blasphemy.  However you want to approach it, one cannot dismiss it.The same year it came out in the New Yorker (1997) Diana Ossana read it and brought it to the attention of her writing partner the venerable Larry McMurtry the writer of an epic novel about the friendship of two men and the lengths each man would go for the other in the remarkable Lonesome Dove.  Together Diana and Larry wrote the screenplay that because the foundation for the film Brokeback Mountain.  They shopped this screenplay around for years with people telling them it was a great script with heart and pathos and yet ultimately couldn't be made in Hollywood because of it's subject matter.That is until 2004, when Focus came into the picture and decided to take a chance, even in today political climate.  And with Ang Lee the director of the Ice Strom and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon directing what could go wrong?  In the leads he cast up and coming stars Heath Ledger as the brooding, repressed Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as the open and optimistic Jack Twist.Many have stated that this is a grand or epic love story.  Which while being the truth isn't the whole story.  It's more complicated than that.  It speaks in a small still voice to what happens when people are told who they love, how they love and how they want to live is wrong.  It's about the cause and effect that social morays can have not just generally but specifically.  And while Brokeback Mountain isn't a political film with a political agenda it does however speak to the political atmosphere both of the time it's set in and unfortunately of today as well; because for all that has change, more has stayed the same.This film isn't for everyone, the subject matter may be hard for some to digest, and impossible for others.  It may shatter the illusions some have of the west and or what some consider the Cowboy influence on our culture.  The truth of the matter is, as much as some don't like it, it's also part of who we are.  Gay, straight, or other, Brokeback Mountain, touches on something we can all understand and empathize with - the human condition - the human heart - the need to be loved - the need for human contact.  It speaks to the human heart and its capacity for love - hate and the repressing burden of self loathing.  It speaks to what can happen when what we need is starkly contrasted by what society says we can have.	5.0	Making the impossible happen....	2006-03-19	53	45	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1CDZNPO7U4E6N	LadyLestat	"First of all, let me just say that I watched this movie once, and even though I liked it this isn't something I would wanna see over and over again. With that being said, I knew, (just like I'm sure you all did) the subject matter of the film, so I don't see why some viewers (no matter how few) act so offended by what they saw. Secondly, you must take into account when this movie takes place (time and era). Thirdly, It seems that instead of dewelling on the superb acting and storyline people are more so effected by the fact that it's about homosexuality between ""gay cowboys"". I guess the point flew over their heads that this is indeed a love story, and as with most love stories (except for teen movies) they all end in tragedy. It's usually in that tragedy that the person realizes what they lost. It actually took Ennis losing Jack to realize that he was the love of his life. I liked it because it was a realistic and very delicate look at love between 2 males. If I wanted to see gay guys sleeping around I could've sat at home and watched ""Queer as Folk"". Another thing is that people seem to be more disgusted at 2 guys than 2 women. I guarantee you if it had been 2 women the guys would've been cheering them on. Anyway, this sort of thing this has been apart of films for as long as I could remember.Let's not forget, Hilary Swank..""Boy's Don't Cry"" or Charlize Theron...""Monster"" it's just that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is sooo in your face. At any rate, to stay on topic, Heath Ledger made his character so believeable that he deserves an Oscar for this. Ennis' inner struggle with his own purpose, identity and sexuality is one that some of my best friends have had to endure. Prejudice is another. Jake's character Jack was also believable, and he deserves an Oscar as well. Even though I may be a straight woman, I could still relate to those feelings of love and hope for someone that you love, and only getting feelings of isolation, regret, shame and embarrassment in return. My only gripe is that I wish they would've explained the ending a lot better. I kinda keeps you guessing about what actually happened to Jack. I think they should've talked more about that. Like, Was he murdered in hate crime fashion because he was gay? Did someone else besides their boss see them on Brokeback Mountain? Did he come on to the wrong guy? I guess I just want to know..Why did they kill him? Also, I'm a little curious because at the end when his wife was talking to Ennis about Jack's death she didn't seem grief stricken like a wife who just lost her husband would. Did she find out about him like Ennis' wife did? or Did her father have something to do with it after Jack stood up to him? I had tons of unanswered questions by the time the movie was over. Which, by the way, this film was way too long come to think of it. However, you have to watch it with an open mind to like it."	5.0	I LIKED IT!!	2006-02-04	0	0	0

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3O51NJCEVIYTF	Landon	Brokeback Mountain, Brokeback Mountain, what IS it about Brokeback Mountain? After all, it's JUST a movie, right? Well...not exactly...There's something about this film that simply, well, gets under your skin. And it stays there until you DO something about it, until you process what your trip to Brokeback Mountain has been for you. I suspect there's a little bit of Brokeback Mountain in all of us. Sure, we all live different lives, but there is a haunting universality to this film that somehow reaches a very deep and oh-so-personal place in the viewer's soul. For this alone I feel Brokeback Mountain deserves all the kudos, (and more), that are coming its way.Brokeback Mountain is a story of joy, of hope, of disappointment, of regret, and much, much more. It's all there. It's a truly human film, and it spans the twenty-some year relationship of two friends, possibly soul mates. This story juxtaposes the power of society's structure and conditioning with the undeniable power of awareness of one's personal truth. It's about survival and destruction. And yes, Brokeback Mountain is a story of love, a love that could be neither denied nor fulfilled.Before I saw Brokeback Mountain I suspected it was going to hardwire itself onto my mental plate.And guess what, it did.This movie is delicate and subtle as it is thundering and raw. It has beautiful scenery, (many panoramic shots are of the Kananaskis Valley in Alberta, Canada), and very real, believable people who interact, at times, with soul-wrenching passion. And if you like interpreting body language, you'll be finding yourself at a virtual smorgasbord!For me, Brokeback Mountain is the true story of many upon many, (regardless of gender), portrayed by its fictitious characters.And about Ang Lee, the film's masterful director - he doesn't tell you what to think, but he certainly gets you thinking! Interestingly, for whatever reason, after I finished watching the film I didn't feel that much of anything. But the next day...I have thought a great deal about many aspects of this film. If you'd like to discuss your impressions with me, drop me a line through Amazon Friends. I'd be especially interested to hear from people who have lived similar lives to those portrayed in the movie.Regards and peace to all...	5.0	Not JUST another film...	2006-02-09	27	19	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1ZFJSOOPTLK2I	Lara	I absolutely adore this movie.  It is one of my Top 10 Favorites!  I have literally watched it so many times I know almost all the lines..  I usually end up annoying the people I watch it with  lol.It's a wonderful romance story about 2 ordinary people who fall in love, who happen to be two men, and in the time period it was set it wasn't an ordinary situation to say the least.  So they had to keep it secret and live separate lives which put a huge strain on their relationship with each other.Deals with the one thing we all have in common ( no matter what sex, race or religion we are) and that is LOVE.  All of us can relate.  We have all felt the passion and the warmth of love, we've all felt the hurt and heartache love can bring us as well.This is one of the best movies of all time in my opinion.  Brilliant performances by Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal.  A must SEE and a must HAVE in your DVD collection.	5.0	yeeehawww.	2010-07-19	8	8	0
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A17ETH9ZYPSM4F	"Larry R. Watts Jr. ""pres2go"""	"A challenging movie that is obviously not for everyone.  I admit that I thought the story was un-filmable -sparse words being so vital to its charm. While I did find the pacing of the near silent first scenes disarming at first, I was quickly swept into the picture and transported. As the closing credits rolled I felt that I had just witnessed something politically important and cinematically poetic. The stunned silence of my fellow viewers made me think that I might be right. Ang Lee made a movie that refuses to capitulate to trend in any way.  Beautifully shot and languidly paced over a twenty-year span without the MTV style quick cuts movies have adopted to the detriment of most. No bombast, no gratuity. McMurtry and Ossana beautifully fleshed out the tale just enough to capture the spirit and soul of these people trapped in a hell worthy of Sartre. The sparseness of the script allows the audience to fill in the spaces with their own interpretations, creating an engaging experience.Heath and Jake create memorable characters by leaving much unsaid - true acting.  Ledger is stunning - made more so by his virtually disposable mainstream performances prior to this - as his every utterance seems an effort to express something while giving away nothing. Gyllenhaal builds upon the stride forward witnessed in ""Jarhead"" and leaves us curious as to what comes next. His ability to convey Jack's recognition that his future could never be as romanticized as his past is beautifully conveyed by only his stare as Ennis drives off.  Michelle Williams' performance of a woman who knows too much too late is revelatory -putting her embryonic years at the Creek behind her - finely balancing a role that could have easily become unsympathetic while recognizing the nuance of victimization. Hathaway, while having little screen time, slips beautifully out of her fluffy tiara persona into a crown of thorn and captures her character's evolution from young Texas spitfire to aging brass beautifully as she truly becomes her daddy's little girl turning brittle from the deprivation of a storybook ending.I'm surprised to see some reviewers focusing on this film as one that glorifies lies and adultery and I have to wonder if we saw the same movie. What I saw was a cautionary tale of the pain and chaos created when one is unable to or refuses to reconcile with what they face in the mirror - a glorification of nothing. This is not a ""gay cowboy"" movie nor is it a ""gay"" anything movie. It's a spiritual movie about everyone's need to find his or her place in the world. Whether you choose to do it with an evangelical theory of God or with any other equally important reference is part of that journey.Many take issue with the film's one true sex scene as being either violent or too graphic. This opinion seems a bit short sighted. It's no more graphic than what is seen on network television at any given hour. Certainly the manner in which it unfolds is not a true example of all gay sex acts since not all gay men live on a mountain and it's no longer 1963. I think neither Jack nor Ennis had time to buy candles or flowers. These men were not ""gay"" in the modern sense since, again, it was 1963.  The film clearly sets the stage for the viewer to understand their slowly growing friendship not with words, but with carefully staged scenes that provide insight into the evolution of the relationship.  In case they are missed, it's all there in Ennis' declaration of ""Hell, that's more than I've said in two years.Jack, as sexual predator is a ridiculous notion: While obviously being the more experienced of the two, let's not forget that it is Ennis, not Jack that returns to the tent. The tenderness that follows obviously shows that this couple is not just about the sex act.I would hope that everyone walks away from the film with a renewed appreciation for who they are and the realization that life is far too short to waste. As I read the majority of reviews posted, I suspect that this point was not only well made by the film, but also well taken by its audience.  As this film leaves a lasting impression on the audience - some say haunting - and creates conversation it fully succeeds as art and deserves any awards it receives."	5.0	Needlessly Controversial	2006-02-04	24	18	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3AUIEYL3Z9QNK	"Laura Christine ""Jewel of Zion"""	"To call this a ""gay cowboy"" movie is to sell it short.  The heart of this film is ""the path not taken"".It is compelling to watch someone look happiness in the eye and walk away from it.  This can happen in heterosexual relationships as well.  Sometimes people feel that they cannot be together.  Perhaps families do not approve, cultural boundaries make it difficult, religious obstacles are too much to overcome, etc.  It could happen to anyone, gay or not.If this type of story grabs you, you should also watch The Lover with Tony Leung and Jane March.  As the wealthy Chinaman wrote to his one-time school-girl, he ""would love her until death"".How ironic that this alleged ""gay cowboy movie"" resulted in the real life love story between Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams.  Jake Gyllenhall became the godfather to their daughter.  We will see Heath's face in Matilda for the duration.Among other things, I will remember Ledger for his response to all those that called him ""brave"" for taking on this role.  He answered something along the lines of ""no, it's people such as firefighters that are brave"".  What a humble reply from a remarkably gifted actor.  We miss you, Heath.I believe the Actor's Academy fell short this time around.  It seemed that Brokeback deserved the Oscar for Best Movie, as Ledger probably merited the Best Actor award.  When the chips were down it appeared that this subject matter was just too much for Hollywood to embrace, at least for the time being."	4.0	A Lot of People Missed the Point	2008-10-31	7	4	3

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"My first impression when I was watching ""Brokeback Mountain"" was that I was being underwhelmed.  The film was receiving universal raves and the public debate about the movie had started to turn to something of a backlash with the argument being that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal should not praised as being brave for playing gay lovers because we are so far past the point when we can make any judgments about an actor's sexual orientation based on the roles we play.  That seems especially clear when this film wins the Golden Globe for best drama and the two top acting awards go to Philip Seymour Hoffman and Felicity Huffman for playing a gay man and a transgender man.  So the point being made about courage is valid enough, but given that ""Brokeback Mountain"" will be the most successful film to have love scenes between two men it does represent a hurdle of sort in American pop culture.It took me a while after watching this film to decide that the best parts of ""Brokeback Mountain"" are not the acting but rather the writing, directing, and music.  This is not to take anything away from the cast, but consider that the script does not really give them the sort of memorable acting moments that win people awards.  Ledger's character of Ennis Del Mar is wired so tight that his emotions barely constitute ripples on his surface.  As his wife, Alma, Michelle Williams is forced to put off her eruption over her husband's infidelities with another man for years.  The contrast between Ledger and Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is that of ice and fire on the surface, and despite the passion that exists between the two men the story arc here is about Jack's efforts to get Ennis to thaw enough so that they can have it all rather than steal moments.I give the major credit for this film to the screenplay by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, based on the short story by Annie Proulx.  When a novel is adapted to the screen there is always so much left out, but with the source here being a short story there are hole, spaces of time really, built into the story.  The film provides sketches of the relationship between Ennis and Jack.  After the first sexual encounter between the two men, we never see that degree of intimacy again, and that leaves open the question of what sort of relationship they had.  I found myself wondering if the two achieved a level of reciprocity or if things continued along the same line.  My interest was not prurient, but rather a question of wanting to understand the character of Ennis and to know if he ever let himself be vulnerable in any way that another human being could tell.  Or did that moment come when he was literally all alone in Jack's bedroom?Consequently the cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto and the music of Gustavo Santaolalla become critical in filling in the gaps in the narrative.  Images and music end up revealing more than words and it is significant that when the depth of the love between Ennis and Jack is revealed that there is only images and music, and not a word is spoken.  The credit that is due director Ang Lee ultimately has to do with bringing these people together to make this movie and tell this story in this particular way.  In an age when a digital screen can be filled with a million images fueled by a combination of imagination and computers, there is something to be said for the sparseness of this film, and not just the idea that less is more.  ""Brokeback Mountain"" creates a elusive blend of intimacy and distance that actively compels its audience to make sense of it all and to find the truth the characters are reluctant if not unable to face.  Ennis will not tell us the depth of this tragedy.  That judgment is left to us."	5.0	"""If you can't fix it, you gotta stand it."""	2006-01-25	20	14	6

So despite my husband's protests and my own hesitancy to watch gay men do their thing, I rented it.  Can we say DISAPPOINTMENT??I gave it 2 stars because of the beautiful scenery and because there were a few scenes that were good.  The story line had the potential to make a good movie, but it just wasn't there. I would like to have seen some background info.  I would like to have seen these characters brought to life.  These characters were empty.  There was just nothing to make us like them.  And there was absolutely no lead-in to the first sexual encounter, just out of nowhere they start going at it like animals?  That's lust, not love. They didn't even seem to like each other much! I have to admit that if I were the one paying them to take care of my animals and they were too busy entertaining themselves to watch the sheep, well I would have been upset too.Even if I did approve of homosexuality, I would not be able to rate this movie any higher. It was slow in some parts and way too fast in other parts, leaving me confused as to what year we were in.  Heath Ledger mumbled through the whole movie and I only caught about 1/4 of what he said.  That was very annoying. Jake Gyllenhaal did okay I thought, but nothing special.I think I really wanted to see LOVE.  I saw lust.  I saw violence, bordering on rape.  And I came away thinking, ""Oh so gay men fight just like straight couples, except they beat each other up everytime just like two little boys on the playground??"" I also saw men hurting their families.  I actually felt bad for Michelle Williams's character when she saw the encounter between her husband and......oh I can't even remember the character's name if that tells you how boring this was!  That was one of the few times I felt anything at all during this movie.  I felt no sympathy for their plight to be together.  Like I said, I felt almost nothing really.  At the end of the movie I felt very empty.  I've never felt this empty after a movie.  I always have SOME feeling either good or bad.  When the credits started rolling all I could think was that I'd wasted $4 renting this one!My husband thinks even 2 stars is too many for this movie.  We do agree that the movie could have been better if they had simply gone into the tent and kissed, leaving the rest to our imaginations.  We're not stupid, we would have known what was going to happen next without having to watch it. I think they mess up a lot of movies that way.....just let the people go into the bedroom and shut the door and we'll get the idea without having to actually see what they're doing. So yes, I would have reacted the same way if it was a heterosexual sex scene.If a re-make were possible, I'd say cut the sex-scene, give the characters personality, get rid of the annoying mumbling, and give us something more interesting than 2 hours of good scenery with a few good scenes thrown in.BM would not have been so highly rated if the couple had been straight.  That's all there is to it.........shock value."	2.0	Empty......very empty	2006-05-31	75	30	45

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	I saw this film a couple of months ago but just haven't gotten around to reviewing it.  By now, of course, everyone knows the general plot.  And everyone has an opinion about this film whether he or she has seen this film or not.  The opinions tend to follow the person's views on the gay issue.  This seems a little unfair because I think a good film should stand by itself and not just be a reflection of a personal opinion about its theme.The credits are impressive.  Ang Lee directed it.  As always, he makes the audience really understand his characters.  The two cowboys, as played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenthal, become real and easily identifiable for their very human qualities.  The film is based on a short story by Annie Proulx.  She writes about the dark side of the American West, not the place of the great John Wayne myths.  The writer, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana are also experts on the west.  I would expect nothing but the best from them.The story is complex and more than the sum of its parts.  It starts in 1963 when the two young men spend a summer working together herding sheep on the lonely Brokeback Mountain.  For the entire summer, they have no other human companionship.  Naturally, a bond develops between them.  And then, on one cold and lonely night, they have a brief romantic encounter.  They both would like it to be only a one-time thing, but it isn't.  Their feelings grow for each other.  Later, they are discovered, go back to their respective lives, and try to forget each other.Both men marry.  Both have children.  The marriages are not happy.  And there are some scenes between these men and their wives that show the sadness and impact of these flawed marriages.  Then, several years later, the men come together again, and from then on, they spend several weeks each summer continuing their relationship on Brokeback Mountain.  They say they are going there to fish; but they never do bring home any fish.The story takes place over couple of decades.  It is a gloomy story, one that the audience knows will end badly.  There's fine acting, great scenery and everything else that deserves the accolades it received.Problem is, the film runs 134 minutes which is much too long.  The action is subtle and brings up unsettling emotions.  After a short while, I knew I had gotten the point of the film.  The storyline didn't really change and there were no surprises.  I found myself constantly looking at my watch.  If I had been home in front of my DVD I know I would have fallen asleep.I commend Brokeback Mountain for its breakthrough approach to a forbidden subject and some great acting.  It was just a little too slow for my taste.	4.0	Breakthrough approach to a forbidden subject, but too slow and too long.	2006-05-25	17	5	12

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1CZKOSULDV3VT	Literato	"Bette Davis once said: ""I adore cheap sentiment."" Well, I don't. My problem with the film has nothing to do with subject matter or actors, although looking for nooky among sheep is a bit weird. Consider these items... Ang Lee is Taiwanese, and Annie Proulx lived most of her life in Maine, until recently moving to Wyoming. Is either of these folks gay? Does either one really understand the values and mind-set of cowboys or Wyoming natives? The film is based upon Proulx's short story, yet it lasts for two and a quarter hours. Add to this the fact that the film is too long for what it achieves... We have no flashbacks or voice-overs to help us understand each character's backstory. Less is more... Scenes would pack more punch if they established something about the characters in a focussed manner, but they drag on aimlessly. Yes, we have to know they're bored and lonely, but assume the audience is intelligent and gets it without overkill. The mountain scenes (pretty to National Geographic addicts) could easily be shortened. As touching as Ledger's pouting tight-lipped speech patterns might be, it is hard to understand the minimal dialogue with this added impediment. Now that gay films are more skilfully written and acted, they are more accessible to straight people. And they leave this film in the dust with regard to brilliant dialogue, backstory, likeable characters, excellent editing and character development. There is no character development in a short story. Why base a film on it, then? Check out Latter Days and Get Real, for starters."	2.0	An Utter Failure on Many Levels	2012-03-26	16	1	15
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL	Little Miss Cutey	Brokeback Mountain is a unique, brilliant and well acted movie.  I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I found myself loving it.  How could you not.  There was stunning scenery and a fantastic score, amazing script and last but not least, some of the best acting we've seen in many years.After working together on Brokeback Mountain, these two cowboys find more than just a friendship - they find forbidden love.  Their first meeting happend in 1963 where homophobia would have been far worse than it is today.  What follows is a moving story of two men trying to come to grips with their feelings for each other and their family life at home with their wives and children.This is a must see for everyone.  You may not think you'll like it, but you will be blown away.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A22RE7V8QZFICW	Lizard	"Ennis and Jack are two farm hands wandering from job to job--end up being hired together, and find each other. Consider the environment-backwoods, poor and lacking in education scenario where gay was treated worst than the plague, no different than the KKK's early treatment of blacks (which still goes on these days in many parts of this country). Ennis and Jack, well they ""found"" each other, had sex, and parted when the job's contract was up--and both ended up living separate lives getting married and even had kids. Yet throughout the 20 years they would get together from time to time, and the impact it had on these two mens' lives...as well as their wives and kids. It treated such things actually in an incredibly sensitive manner, suprisingly. I'm sure such things happened many times. The tragedies occurred NOT due to the homosexuality, but the REPRESSION of it and the devistating consequences of trying to live a lie, and how living such a lie may impact on other people; as well as society's (oftentimes legal) prejudice against gays as a whole.I really didn't find the movie that heartbreaking, and the first 45 to 50 minutes actually bored me. I've seen far more emotional movies (not of the gay genre) that winning so many awards perplexed me. It was a GOOD movie. I've seen much more emotional movies than this. It did not make me cry or anything like that, although it was touching.I HIGHLY recommend renting this movie. Note there is some nudity in this movie-be aware of this.I guess my only real complaint at times I found it very hard to understand-I can't stand it when an actor mumbles."	4.0	Brokeback Moutain a good movie about two ordinary men	2006-04-09	17	4	13

So I rented Brokeback Mountain, since I thought it would be an excellent film for the title.It sure is, but not in the way I anticipatedAfter watching the film, I am convinced that, even though most movies today are degrading our society and culture, masterpieces like these will always demonstrate humanity at its finest. So I wrote an entire essay countering my professor's view on movies.When I got the paper back on Thursday, I was surprised to have received an A+. The professor thinks I make a good argument, and my ideas are provocative. I wish I can take the credit for this grade, but I owe it all to Ms. Anne Proulx and Mr. Ang Lee and their masterpiece Brokeback Mountain.Some of you may not like this film, but you got to admit, the film demonstrate all sorts of emotion, and the very concept of this movie is thought provoking.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2P9R2G8Y6CHBT	"LombaireFan ""LF"""	"Directed by Ang Lee and starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, this is easily the most talked-about motion picture of the year, if not the decade. With all the controversy, the criticism, the parodies, it's hard to imagine anyone visiting this site not already familar with much of what takes place in this film. But out of respect for those who haven't seen it, my review contains absolutely NO spoilers.Brokeback tells the story of Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal), a pair of young ranch hands who over the course of an early '60s summer in Wyoming discover that they really enjoy doing things together. Things like swimming, fishing, horseback riding and just about anything else that might strike their fancy. But there's one catch: they really, really like doing things together. Like more than they've ever liked doing things with anyone else before. Herein lies the film's universality, as I think we all remember that one buddy from summer camp with whom we just could not part ways. Anyone who's been through that experience or anything similar will surely identify with the characters in this film, to some extent.So Ennis and Jack promise to be Best Friends Forever while agreeing to keep it ""on the downlow"", so to speak, as they both get married and start their lives in earnest. But neither can escape the feeling that they'd really rather be doing things together. They agree to get together once a year and return to Brokeback Mountain - and who can blame them? The scenery is gorgeous. However, the wives (Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams) get a little concerned, as wives tend to do when a husband is spending all his time horsing around with one of his close pals and ignoring the homefront. Again, this is a movie that nearly every American male will relate to, though perhaps some more than others.As the film progresses, taking us further into the character's lives, it takes on tragic dimensions. We come to feel that Ennis and Jack were destined to do things together but their lives have been undone by society's tendency to frown upon certain people doing things together. Yes, it's a downer.But Brokeback Mountain is also a very thought-provoking film. I thought about it an awful lot afterwards, which is odd since I've never been a fan of cowboy movies. Certain scenes replayed in my thoughts a lot - so much so that I had to mentally recast the film just to get it out of my head; my version of Brokeback stars Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti. It's just as well-acted but a little less thought-provoking.So cheers to Brokeback Mountain - the Best Picture of the Year!"	5.0	It's Raining Cowboys!	2006-03-05	26	19	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3F0FQL345CUK6	"""Loopydloop"""	"I don't know what it is about films like this one or another ""head-scratcher"" from a few years back, ""A Beautiful Mind"", that gets audiences and even some critics so stirred up, but they are certainly not what might be considered noteworthy. Now, this film is actually very beautifully shot. The scenery is just breathtaking. In fact, I constantly found my mind and my eye being drawn to the composition of the shots and grandeur of the landscapes, leaving me completely bored by the melodrama being played out in it's proscenium. There is one award worthy, performance in the film given by Michelle Williams as the betrayed wife of one of the two leads. Her characterization was strong, sympathetic and very moving overall. What I find the most interesting about all the excitement surrounding this film is that there was another film out this year with a similar plot line and situation to this film entitled, ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"". It was also about cowboys and concerned relationships, honor and duty, but without the homosexual angle that I feel was exploited in ""Brokeback"". ""Three Burials...."" was an extremely well made film but, sadly, without the tabloid sensationalism and hype lavished on ""Brokeback"", it remained relatively obscure and unnoticed by the general movie going public. But all that hype did not garner this film a Best Picture award and this may be a sign that the Academy members are finally starting to be a little more discerning of which films are bestowed that honor. Granted, ""Crash"" ended up with best picture and best song went to ""It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp"", so there is clearly still room for improvement. And so, I turn my head towards the future with hopes for better offerings in the coming year and on down the road."	2.0	A film one can easily quit on.	2006-05-27	44	15	29
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1I9B4PSCDDWOO	"lordhoot ""lordhoot"""	"I would regard Brokeback Mountain as a solidly good movie but I won't called it great or excellent. This movie tells a story of two men, who happened to be in love with each other and spent their entire lives leading a double life. While this is a ""gay movie"", it more closer to a character study of these two men, trapped by custom, families, reputation and lack of understanding that make their lives so unhappy until they get reunited for their many ""fishing trips"" up to Brokeback Mountain. Both men, trapped by the conventions of their lives, endured the best they can, when they can to grabbed little happiness with each other. The entire movie centered around their relationship, their friendship and their love.The two male stars, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllanhall carried this movie. For me, Ledger was quite surprising since he was really good in this movie. I figured that since he's such a pathetic actor in the past, getting by on his looks rather then his skills, he simply looked far superior then he really is. He also took the Charlize Theron path by muddling up his looks. He doesn't look like he does in the past movies or even his current one, Casanova. Jake Gyllanhall proves to be the weak link. He still haven't captured the skills needed to ranged out his character in a very convincing way. Both of them were ably supported by their supporting cast. The production values proves to be high and the dialogue overall, proves to be excellent.There are several weaknesses in this film that many critics have overlooked. First one and a very important one is that there seem to be a definite lack of chemistry between the two male lovers. A certain lack of spark between them, that any two lovers may have, may they be hetrosexual or homosexual. This is important since it almost looked like Ledger and Gyllenhaal are forcing it instead of feeling it. While film looked closely at their friendship, it doesn't look close enough in their love. A major weakness by Ang Lee who otherwise directed a fine movie. Second, the make up needed some work. Ledgar aged pretty well since he was muddled up in the first place but Gyllenhaal's make-up looked pretty faked. Adding gray don't aged a man.In many ways, this movie reminded me strongly of a German movie that came out in several years ago titled Aimee & Jaguar, a movie about two German women during World War II, finding love and friendship with each other. The situation seem to be very familiar between the two movies outside of the sex of the main characters.In my opinion, the critics have grossly overhyped this movie for some unknown political correctness. Its a good solid film, remarkably high quality but its a type of film that most people will see it once and probably won't see it again. But you should see it at least once. Thanks to Aimee & Jaguar, it been done before so there's no originality issue but its an interesting character study. I wondered how many more gay men who lived back then, in that region, who also suffered so?"	4.0	Good solid movie that can go without the hype.	2006-01-10	10	3	7

What this reviewer forgot to answer, is why.The reality is, these men were forced into marriage. The relationship was doomed to fail from the beginning, and if it was another time and place, they would never have got married, and would, instead, spend their life together as they should.Viewers understand that, and that's why people loved these two characters, even after the tragedies they caused.

There is one scene early on, as I suppose there must be, that leaves you with absolutely no doubt that these two young men began a sexual relationship.  After that, it is implied (i.e., you see them laying in bed together from the chest up, nakedness implied, but after that first initial scene when the sex happens there is no more implicit sex.  This allowed me to put the sex in the background and concentrate more on the &#34;star-crossed lovers&#34; aspect of the film which is, indeed, a tear-jerker of a chick flick.  I don't think most homophobic &#34;real men&#34; are going to necessarily enjoy this movie - - it is not a fast-paced action flick, it's much more emotional, but I liked it enough to buy it on Kindle so I could watch it a couple times a year.  To me anyway, worth a repeat watch, especially if I'm feeling soulful and sad anyway.

There have been many cities that accepted gays. NY, SF, New O., Chicago, and most major cites in the north. Why not go there? If they they were gay why did they marry women?  None of this made sense to me. I remember the 60's and there were gay people who were out, and nobody cared.  I don't think the movie was a true perspective of gay life when these 2 guys got together.  It wasn't until the 80's and HIV came along that homosexuality became a big scare, and with good reason.  But back in the 60s and 70's gays were accepted in many cities.If they wanted to ride around in the mountains, and get married, then they made their choices.

It was exqusitely subtle in its treatment of the ocean deep and almost mystic bond between Ennis and Jack. The movie told more where it left off in details. No into your face theatrics at all. Both the short story and the movie kept the narration away from the epicentre of what the 2 men were really feeling. Only occasionallly were the boiling and roiling emotions of the characters broke thru the surface and the audience was thus devastated by the sudden revelation of the crushing weight that the 2 men were carrying on the shoulders and in their hearts. I thank Annie and Ang for telling such an exceedingly moving story in such a poetic way. I hope people world over can realize via the movie that love between 2 men could be every bit as pure, dignified and precious as love between a man and a woman.Finally, truth be told, having 2 very gd-looking guys playing Ennis and Jack did help a great deal. The ethereal and majestic setting of Brokeback Mountain (Canada's Ablerta?) didn't hurt, either.	5.0	Couldn't stop crying	2006-03-02	18	12	6

Don't get me wrong, it's a nice film with a moving story and decent acting.  But once you get past the non-mainstream aspects of the story, this is not a remarkable film.  Heath Ledger did quite well with the role of Ennis, FOR Heath Ledger.  In other words, it was definitely one of his better outings, but it was otherwise not what I would characterize as a ""remarkable"" performance.I'm a Jake Gyllenhaal fan, but neither he nor Anne Hathaway ever looked completely comfortable in the skins of their respective characters (Anne particularly), especially as the film progresses and Ang Lee turns them into bizarre caricatures of 1970s Texans.Now, Michelle Williams' performance?  Terrific.  She actually was ""remarkable"".Other aspects of the film missed as well.  Shots that might look good for the publicity stills or on the trailer, look totally contrived and unnatural in the film.  And they had all that beautiful mountain scenery to take advantage of, but they missed there too.  I don't know what they did, but shots that could have been breathtaking seemed somewhat flat and uninspired.Hype, hype, hype.  The only reason this little film is doing as well as it is at the box office is curiosity.  Between the subject matter and all the noise, folks that otherwise would be unlikely to ever drop $10 at the theater for a little movie with no space battles or giant apes are succumbing to curiosity now rather than waiting for cable or DVD.  Hype, hype, hype.Again, it is a nice, thoughtful film and worth a look, but it is miles away from deserving a Best Picture nod, especially given the superior caliber of its fellow nominees."	3.0	Boy, when that hype machine gets cranked up . . . . .	2006-02-10	64	13	51

But I also liked it a lot more than I expected I would.  The scenery, music, editing and acting come together to produce a beautiful, thoughtful and tragic story that has a lot to say about the nature of human relationships and what we need and value in them.  Ang Lee definitely deserved the directing oscar, as this could have been detestable if not wholly laughable.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3UANHCY16H45E	Luv Chocolate	Happily married and heterosexual, I was reluctant to see BBM, thinking it would be uncomfortable to watch a love affair between two men. On the contrary, I was completely absorbed  and deeply affected by this beautiful, passionate, and heartbreaking movie. After seeing it in the theater three times, I still couldn't wait until the DVD came out. There are many scenes I watch over and over, marvelling at the superb acting, the intricately woven score, and breathtaking scenery.  While waiting for the DVD, I read Annie Proulx's amazing short story.  This brought extra depth to the characters and helped me appreciate the movie even more. It is great to read all of the expertly written, positive reviews on this site and know  many others have taken this movie to heart.I was very disappointed Crash won best picture over BBM. When Jack Nicholson made the announcement, I turned off the TV immediately and didn't watch a single post-Oscar show the rest of the week. The whole process of choosing winners seems completely political to me. As excellent and thought-provoking as Crash was, seeing it once was enough. I felt BBM was a better movie overall and will certainly be remembered long after Crash.  Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Michelle Williams would have been my choices to win in their categories. Jake's portrayal of Jack was simply mesmerizing.  He was also wonderful in Lovely and Amazing, The Good Girl, Proof and Jarhead.  At least Ang Lee won his much deserved Oscar. I hope he continues to push the envelope and make movies which stir the soul as BBM did mine.	5.0	Wonderful movie	2006-04-09	39	32	7

I have to say, now that I've seen ""Brokeback Mountain,"" that ""Crash"" deserved to win.  I won't go into all the plot detail as most reviewers feel compelled to do, but I did feel that, although the scenery is beautiful and the acting is believable, the story is not compelling.  Jack and Ennis are not terrribly sympathetic characters, and I felt the most empathy for Alma (Michelle Willliams), Ennis's long-suffering wife. The movie is not romantic at all, even though the director tries to bolster this view by setting the majority of Ennis and Jack's love scenes in the majestic, wild, and free Montana mountains.  To create a contrast between their love affair and their ""real-life"" (read ""forced"") relationships, the director made sure that scenes of Jack and Ennis's married life were set in oppressive, flat, ugly, and characterless towns drawn staight from ""Urban Cowboy.""  No wonder they longed for their days on Brokeback Mountain! Movies with little action can still be mesmerizing (see ""Lost in Translation""), but this flick borders on the anesthetizing and devolves into a sort of gay ""Same Time Next Year."" I can't help but wonder: If this  film had been about a heterosexual couple, even a 60's era interrracial couple, would it have generated anything near this level of hype?"	2.0	Overrated	2006-04-28	76	25	51

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A9REEKTBGZ5W0	Lydia's Mommy	I did enjoy this movie, not because it was an epic love story, but rather because it had some good acting and beautiful cinimatography.  Michelle Williams was especially good at portraying a heartbroken wife upon seeing her husband make out with a guy.  But so many things frustrated me about the story.  Why was Alma still sleeping with her husband, and keeping quiet about what she knew for so many years?  Was Ennis really gay, or just feeling randy due to his lack of womanly contact out in the wilderness?  I hate that these two guys dragged their wives down and hurt their children, all because they weren't being honest with themselves.  And the ending was predictable at about half an hour into the movie.  I'm not even sure how in love they were with each other.  It seemed more like three-times-a-year lust to me.I can imagine the two of them sitting silent across a kitchen table if they were to ever live on a ranch together.  Jack would come home late to a cold dinner that Ennis had cooked, and they'd bicker, and then Jack would go get his jollies somewhere else, while Ennis would sit mumbling.  All in all, I'm telling people this was a good movie, but the premise definitely could have been more realistic and emotional.	3.0	Two Selfish Cowboys	2006-04-17	72	19	53

Many did. Some were gay, some were not. Gays did have to stay in the closet then, but these characters, don't even have the guts to do that! I think their lack of backbone aggravated me about as much as anything in this film.They never do anything to make things better between them.The other highly unsatisfactory thing about this film is that the men are portrayed as if being homosexual is just a choice. They have no obvious problems in being with women.Nor do we get any backstory on them regarding sexual orientation when they were growing up.The sex between them is very sudden, with no lead-in, no hint whatsoever that homosexuality has ever even crossed either of them's minds.Jack is made to be the ""gayer"" of the two, in that he does eventually get it on with a couple of other guys. Ennis never does. Yet even Jack marries, fathers a child, and remains married. He and his wife drift apart somewhat, but no more so than a straight couple might.Both Jack and Ennis are portrayed as losers. Ennis never makes a decent wage. Jack marries into money, but his father in law barely manages to tolerate him.The two lead actors do their parts well, and there's beautiful Wyoming scenery, but this film really did no great service to the gay community as far as I am concerned"	2.0	This film frustrates me on many levels	2006-05-30	53	26	27

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1WCGTSTTMNZ78	"Major Bernard ""Jon Runner"""	"This is a wonderful and powerfully touching movie. As a dad with two boys, I think there is one message that is lost to most of the reviewers. I'm not going to rehash the story, but focus on a deeper subtext that raises this story to a level similar to Jere Myles' book ""Murder on the Pier."" This is a story about unfulfilled expectations on the part of all the central characters, but the deeper meaning in this story is Ennis's inability to grasp a hold on his life because of an absent father. Ennis' feelings are as orphaned to him as he has felt throughout his life, and it is not ironic that of the two, he is the one who is obviously in control. The irony is, he doesn't know what to with it. The 'it' being the love he has for Jack.This movie will be discussed on campuses, restaurants and perhaps even Congress, possibly even pulpits. Arguments will ensue on what made each of them the way they are, but the philosophical underpinning of this movie that makes it touch the fiber of every man is the love of a father, and how that can help frame one's destiny.Captured on a backdrop of beautiful breathtaking scenery a love story evolves amidst the volatile uncertainty of the 60s. Lee's direction is terse and laconic. There are no opportunities for you to dwell on melodrama. He doesn't allow it. As an audience member, you feel each moment of this movie, whether it's the first night in the tent, or twenty years later when Jack admits he can't shake his love for Ennis. You have been prepped and disarmed to soak each moment as just that...a moment in time that's not yours, as much as it is the characters on the screen. You don't want the movie to end. You don't want them to leave each other. You don't want them to leave the mountain, but with the same inevitability of them having to relinquish their expectant hold on each other, you hold on to the idea that maybe they were right, and the rest of the people around them were wrong.As Jonathan Rose in Myles' book, ""Hate Crimes..."" asked ""What are the three most important, and perhaps the three most misunderstood words in a relationship?"" The reader, as well as the movie goer encounters these words by understanding as Rose in Myles' book understands it's about, ""Having no expectations. You expect the person who tells you I love you, that they love you too. You place a condition on something that should be unconditional. The most important thing to remember here, is that the first 'having no expectations,' is cognitive. You must first think the phrase like you would a new language. The second is self-actualizing. By understanding the phrase, verbalizing it through your understanding, you can then act accordingly. You tie yourselves in knots my limiting your partners, or prospective partners within your parameters, as opposed to allowing them to be free to teach you, and carry you to new dimensions, or share old ones with them."" This movie will tie you in knots and make you think about relationships in a totally different unexpectant context.Heath Ledger's acting is as understated as the majesty of the azure skies of Brokeback Mountain. By contrast, Gyllenhaal's direct aggressive approach toward Jack complements the sullen Ennis. By allowing himself to be overwhelmed, Gyllenhaal is overwhelming as he brutally assaults his inward demons whether it's through a kiss, unrepentant embrace, or castigating an overbearing father-in-law who's never been put in his place. You never feel either Ledger or Gyllenhaal is acting. Not even when Ennis overwhelmingly assaults Jack after not seeing him for four years under the barest of concealment of a staircase where Ennis now lives with his wife and two daughters, one of the more pivotal points in the movie.This is a man's movie, but a complete review of this movie would be incomplete without mentioning the supporting female cast. Each in their own way, add a dimension that forces the audience to empathize and commiserate with Ennis and Jack. Michelle Williams is probably the standout as she gives men something to hate, when we really want someone to understand us and let us be. On the other hand, I was particularly moved by Linda Cardellini, who becomes Ennis' girlfriend after his divorce. Not on the screen as much as Michelle Williams, Cardellini causes the audience to whimper for both her and Ennis as she is the most fragile and redeeming of the women drawn here. Unable to understand being shut out of Ennis' life, her one tear toward the end of the movie qualifies her as Shakespearean a tragedienne as Eileen Prescott in Myles' 'Hate Crimes' novel. Likewise, as haunting and unforgettable are the few chosen words and expressions Jack's mother offers Ennis before providing him with a brown paper bag for his own.Finally, what makes this a man movie for me is Jack's dad. Unlike Jack, Jack's father had no expectations of his son. He loved him as deeply as men in those days were silent about loving, even their own sons. That's what makes this movie a tragically beautiful true to life story. I will not destroy the ending, but the scene with Jack's father was to me, one of the more poignant and spoke volumes about acceptance, affirmation and the accountability that good fathers need to have of themselves to make sure they raise sons that love themselves.

And it is beautiful in all of its theme of  longing...for unrequited love.Keith Ledger is convincing as Ennis and Jake Gyllenhaul is splendid as Jack.  They protray two sheepherders who make a life long connection as they have fallen hopelessly and sadly in love with each other in the 1960's.Nods to Anne Hathaway and Michelle Phillips as the long suffering spouses of the pair.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1QC72PPJQ0Z7N	Maria Milton	Brokeback Mountain is an incredible movie about a forbidden romance that truly captivate the souls of the watchers.I watched this movie both in box office, and on DVD. My whole family enjoyed it, though my husband seems quite surprised to see that I am not offended by the men going behind the wives' backs.The fact is, I despise men who cheat, but the circumstances are different. Ennis and Jack, in a way, are bonded as mates emotionally, and had the world have a more open point of view, they will not need to suffer, and neither will their wives. But they had to get married because for Ennis, his family demands it, and for Jack, people are excluding him for trying to establish homosexual relationships.I can see why people will be offended by these two cowboys, but quite frankly, I just cannot feel any anger for them. Perhaps it is how director Ang Lee played his emotion magic again on its audience, or that I can understand the circumstances. But either way, the fact remains that this movie is probably the best movie I have ever seen.If there is any anger I feel about this movie, it will be the Academy's unjust ruling in awarding Crash the Best Picture of 2005. The movie have good intentions written all over it, but it is just a poorly directed, and filmed motion pictures. I do not see why Brokeback Mountain did not receive the Best Pictures of 2005, except that the Academy judges are homophobic.	5.0	The Men in the Film Did NOT Cause the Wives to Suffer, Society Did	2006-05-29	26	18	8

I understand that some people may be offended by this movie, and in this case, if you are one of those people, please don't watch it and trash the movie.  For us open minded people, this is one of the best love stories I have ever seen.  Wonderfully acted, Heath Ledger is only bested this year by the performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman in Capote (consequently in another homosexual role).  Jake Gyllenhaal is pretty good in this movie, but only Ledger's Ennis has enough depth to his character.  This movie is firstly about him, and secondly about his relationship with Jack (Gyllenhaal).  This is a wonderful tragedy.  It seems like a modern day Shakespearian tragedy.

It's an ignorant statement, and makes one ignore the underlying value of the films.I fully understand and appreciate the messages and beauty of this film, albeit saddly, trying to wake people up from propaganda and prejudice, thinking that everyone is intelligent enough to appreciate this film.But the thing that perfected this movie for me was the acting. Heath ledger made a striking resemblence to his character throughout the entire film, leading me to capture all his acting highlights (something i RARELY do.), Gyllenhall was also amazing for a guy who started off as the bubble boy, but again, his role in Brokeback Mountain totally brokethrough all previous labels behind. When I think breakthroughs I think rockets, always exceeding the expectation of mankind.Moreover, I will even give the film this: absolutely stunning, vivid, amazing cinematography. my god, there were some shots in this that sincerely reminded me of moments in Akira Kurosawa's latter-masterpieces Ran and Kagemusha.So, in summary, the cinematography just enhances this film that was perfected through the incredible acting and about 30 minutes of extra footage that truly motivated you to take a stand for what is right."	5.0	A Lifetime Film With High Profit and Even Higher Spiritual Value	2006-04-18	30	18	12

""If you can't fix it, you gotta stand it.""  This dialogue is repeatedly listenable, terse and dry, like the scenery.  The film follows western men Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) over two decades of their relationship.  Both men are great actors and use their faces and bodies to paint the range of emotions associated with the paradoxical pleasure and pain of love and attraction, with all its glorious moments and terrible imperfections.The western Rockies (from Alberta through Wyoming) form the landscape for much of the film.  I love this country and the filmmaker respected its beauty and austerity.  The Tetons penetrate upward through the crust of the earth like fingers, skyward.  It's a land in which you can find time to think, where nature paints the skies with wind and cloud.  The film affords the thoughtful viewer reflective moments.A couple of things seemed a little silly to me.  ""Let's indicate it's the '70s by giving the boys identicle sideburns!""  And Twist wasn't entirely authentic as a rodeo cowboy, but he was fair.  On the plus side, some of the nuances of eye contact and body language as people - in an instant - try to sort each other out on the basics were expertly filmed.  I also loved the way the filmmakers made the connection between the touch and smell of physical artifacts as a token of a person who isn't present and very deeply missed.I didn't end up seeing this until after the passing of the Heath Ledger, and it's an extra sadness that this film now - in addition to everything else it does well - serves as a memorial to his great talent.  His portrayal of Ennis, a decent Wyoming ranchhand who settles into a dutiful dullness and only comes out of it into incandesence when his friend Jack comes around, is simply wonderful.  Also painfully wonderful is Michelle William's performance as Ennis' wife, Alma, a good woman who for a time submits to a relationship that's less than what she'd hoped for.  Her resignation is one of the saddest aspects of this film.  In many ways, the mantle of that suffering was picked up by Ennis' daughter, Alma Jr. (Kate Mara) as the film develops.And the music...  The lush guitar fills the film with an aural soundscape complementary to the visual. The orchestrated version of the main theme resonated with me in such a glorious and sad way, as though experiencing a orange and purple sunset one knows might be one's last.This is not a film that glorfies what Jack and Ennis had.

The movie theater was packed with all people both straight and gay. There was not an eye that dry when the movie was over. I liked this movie for what it is and what it stands for. It is a story about about two men that find each other in the early 60s and fall in love. If everyone remembers what the early 60s were like for people of color, and everyone that  was a different faith than Christian. This was not a time of safety for anyone that was different from the white Christian hetrosexual family. With that being said, Jack and Enis did what they had to at the time the movie took place for the safety of themselves and their families. I find it very interesting what people are saying about this movie and why they don't like it. All that they are talking about is how these two men in love cheated on their wives. I ask myself, can these reviewers see the trees through the forest? Or better yet, can they see past their own noses (the reviewers) and walk in these men's shoes in that era being who they were? No, they would not have the strength to be who they were in those times. I am a person that came out in the 80s, into a society that was not accepting of me or my partner. I can only imagine what it was like in the 60s where everyone was hated for being different than a white hetrosexual Christian male. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see pure strength and a fearlessness for who they love.	5.0	A story of two men in love	2007-03-05	23	18	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2SY0QKQO1N34F	"Mark R. Mazza ""MarkInEugene"""	"This is story telling at its best. I give my heartfelt thanks to the entire cast, crew, writers, producers and director for making such a sublimely beautiful story. This movie depicts the tortured life of two poor, uneducated guys who just happened to be gay growing up in the deeply homophobic heartland (an oxymoron if I've ever heard one). Their story is painful to watch and makes you wonder, if in a different world, they would have lived long fulfilled happy lives.  But ignorance is alive and well in the good ol' USA guaranteeing many more years of tragic stories like this one for the unfortunate souls deemed unworthy of the righteous right.  Hopefully the laws of physics will keep humanity from reaching distant worlds for thousands of years to come.  The idiotic way we treat each other and our own planet is proof enough that we don't deserve such power and knowledge. More importantly however, alien species wouldn't deserve our hatred, bigotry and man-made religious intolerance!  Brokeback Mountain, though not intended, is a testament to human ignorance and intolerance!  But its also a wake up call to an emotionally psychotic society that still churns out young men with a deep hatred and fear of the emotion Brokeback brings to life with such clarity.  The question so many have not faced is ""What are you so afraid of and why?""  This movie is a timely and important film to be seen by all."	5.0	Honest, tragic and haunting...a beautiful piece of creativity!	2006-04-24	28	22	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1DZKOOMMJM1MI	"Mark Twain ""Sam"""	Brokeback Mountain is by far the most disappointing film of the year. The glowing reviews are flowing in every major magazine and by every major critic. My friends kept telling me how amazing it was, how beautiful, and how achingly real. My boyfriend and I headed into the theatre excited and ready to be amazed. Half the audience applauded once the film was over. My boyfriend and I were relieved it didn't go on longer.The film starts off slowly, and goes on way too long, but that's not the problem. The main problem is that the film tries to be so artsy with its two second scenes and excruciating shots of nature, it never gives its audience a chance to know the characters. The main love story between two men lovers is never fleshed out, and I never understood what drew them together or why they had such a long and lasting relationship. All we ever see them do is fish, herd sheep, wrestle topless, skinny dip, and have very rough sex, which I found a really offensive stereotype. I did not notice any love between these two men, animal lust is more like it.The story is such a mess, important characters aren't even introduced until a good third of the way into the film, after which their storylines are wrapped up way too quickly. 1963 goes on for 45 minutes, and could have easily been cut down to 15, while the rest of the 20 years the story takes place flashes by. For what? For the sake of seeing our sheep herders (not cowboys by the way) do their job or take a break from it to eat a can of beans, or ten shots of sheep flocking by too many. These scenes do nothing to advance the story and instead make the film tedious and almost unbearable. The time could have been used to flesh out the cardboard characters instead.I'll give Brokeback Mountain one praise, and that is for its amazing and talented cast. Jake Gyllenhal and Heath Ledger are quite good, and Michelle Williams is terrific. Her long-suffering wife might be a clich&eacute;, but she is the most fleshed out, and most real character in the film. Anne Hathaway, a great actress, is almost wasted in her brief role, as are Anna Farris and Linda Cardellini, in almost cameo roles, which definitely could have used some fleshing out, or deleting altogether. The rest of their scenes were no doubt deleted to make room for more shots of nature, sheep, and topless wresting scenes between the two men.To say BrokeBack Mountain is disappointing is not enough. With all the praise it's receiving, I'd have at least expected a good film, if not a great one. Brokeback Mountain might pretend it's a good film, but it definitely isn't. In fact, it's been done much better before. I should have avoided this mess and seen Rent for the fourth time instead!	2.0	One of the most overrated films EVER!	2006-01-02	126	32	94
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AAYE34TCTNV2R	MarlowesMom	"SPOILER ALERT""Brokeback Mountain"" is one of the most affecting, beautiful movies I've ever seen. It's beyond Western, it's beyond romance, it's beyond gay cinema, although it has elements of all of these things. It's simply great cinema. Every aesthetic and technical detail is superb, making the elegiac pace not just bearable but enjoyable. Jake Gyllenhaal excels as Jack Twist; his performance only suffers by comparison to Heath Ledger's anguished genius as Ennis Del Mar (which means, fittingly, ""island in the sea""). Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway do fine work as Ennis and Jack's wives respectively.""Brokeback Mountain""'s tragedy is specific to its time, place and characters. It is about the oppression and marginalization of gay men in small-town America in the early 1960s. In that time and place, no gay person would ever dare to ""come out."" Jack at least understands who he is. The viewer never doubts that Jack is a closeted gay man. Although he marries and has a child (as did many gay men in that era, including members of my family), during his and Ennis's many lengthy separations, Jack picks up gay prostitutes in Mexico and reaches out to another man to determine if he too might be gay. It's strongly hinted that Jack is killed because he dares to follow his true nature. Jack's tragedy is that he is a gay man in the wrong place and time.Ennis is the character who is ""locked down"" in a more universal way and therefore brings the film to its more universal tragedy. Ennis liked school but was unable to graduate due to dire family circumstances. He has an indelible childhood memory of seeing a rancher suspected of homosexuality tortured and killed and the fear never leaves him. Although Jack suggests that he and Ennis leave and go to a big city or start a ranch together somewhere, Ennis is trapped by his limitations, his fears,  other people's expectations, and his own expectations. He stays in his bleak home town, marries his high school girlfriend, and has two daughters, stuck forever in material and emotional poverty. Unlike Jack, there is no suggestion that Ennis is attracted to any man other than Jack. In fact, after his divorce, Ennis dates another woman, but things don't work because he's so shut down emotionally. Whatever Ennis's clinical sexual orientation may be, Jack is the love of Ennis's life, as we see from the exquisite scene at the end of the movie where Ennis, in his lonely trailer, cries over his and the now-dead Jacks' shirts, together on the same hanger, and Willie Nelson's ""He Was a Friend of Mine"" plays over the closing credits. Ennis's is the tragedy of the person or any race or sexual orientation at any time in history whose combination of life circumstances and personality prevent him or her from living an authentic and rewarding life.""Brokeback Mountain"" is that rare treasure of a movie that engages you emotionally, makes you think, and is at the artistic pinnacle of the filmmakers' art and craft. Of course it did not win the Best Picture Academy Award. That distinction went to the superficial ""Crash."" No matter. People will be watching and weeping over ""Brokeback Mountain"" in future decades, long past the time when love is no longer divided into gay and straight but is simply love, while ""Crash"" becomes an obscure curiosity."	5.0	Specific, Universal, Breathtaking	2011-08-25	11	11	0
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2UQKHJOTE0UW1	MarsTwain	Yeah, it's the gay cowboy film. But it's really about forbidden love and being something you are not allowed to be on pain of death. Two men ruin their lives and the lives of everyone around them by not admitting that they're what they are. The commentary that makes the film poignant and real and, in that, terrifying and horrible, is that sometimes you can't be honest about what you really feel if you don't want society to extinguish you. The acting, of course, only rubs it in. A brilliantly acted, sensitively directed, gorgeously filmed tragedy.	4.0	Brilliant acting, painful story	2013-02-10	0	0	0

Not that I have anything against gay people (some of my best friends have been gay) I just don't particularly care for Westerns and was scared this would be boring.Boy was I wrong.Brokeback Mountain had my attention from start to finish. And what is even surprising to me is... I liked it. It made me cry at the end. It was very moving. Very heartfelt. Very heartbreaking. It is an emotional roller coaster.What do you do if you fall in love with someone you can't have? You carry that flame for 4 years and once you see one another again... the flame becomes a fire that consumes both of you with passion, desire, and love? Love is the hardest thing to admit to and the hardest thing to let go of. This movie, shows how beautiful love can be... and also how heartbreaking it really is.See it even if you don't LIKE that kind of movie. You don't see any sex really... you see naked man bum but that is all. It isn't all perverted gay sex with nudity. Seriously. All you do see is a few bums and that is all. I promise. The story isn't about SEX it is about love... a deep love... and a deep regret.I really think the lesson of the story was Never Put off love... you have to grasp it and hold onto it... or one day, you could loose it forever... and you will be left with nothing but regrets.	5.0	Beautiful BrokeBack Mountain.	2006-06-02	35	30	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AWPODHOB4GFWL	"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF"""	Annie Proux's short story is magnificently reproduced on the screen with Ang Lee's amazing cinematography.  It's as sparse and simple a tale as they get, but the drama is tense and sometimes unbearable.  Jack and Ennis are two sheepherders in 1963 Wyoming, working for little money that summer.  They unexpectedly fall in love, but each one takes a different path in life.  The film follows the result of their lives and their decisions over the next twenty years.  Most people have heard of this film, but those who have seen it can speak for the raw imagery and gut-wrenching story of love that cannot be fulfilled.  The pace is deliberate and every scene or piece of dialogue rings true.  This is an instant classic and one that will be remembered forever as the movie that used to be called the `gay cowboy movie'.	5.0	Sparse Raw Imagery	2006-07-21	32	29	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O	"MartinP ""MartinP"""	"This film tells the story of two Wyoming ranch-hands getting a job together and eventually finding themselves in love with each other. The impact of this impossible love on their further lives is laid bare in agonizing detail, resulting in a heartbreakingly poignant conclusion that leaves not a single winner. Those who prefer happy endings are well advised to stay away, though they will be the poorer for it.The brilliant opening scene has you riveted right away. The main protagonists appear in the shot, yet all there is is silence. It takes ages for anyone to say anything, and when the first full sentence is spoken it is by neither of the boys, but by the man they are seeking a job from. It is typical of the film: enormous suspense and terrific emotional charges build up through silence and lack of action. The smallest gestures and the tiniest, mumbled phrases gain huge significance: Ennis squatting naked in the background, washing himself, and Jack in the foreground, very actively NOT looking. If you don't have an eye for such detail, this movie will mean nothing to you. If you do, the characters will speak to you in an unprecedented way, and you'll even find an occasional tongue in cheek joke adding some comic relief to this tragic story (e.g., Jack driving a tractor of the 'Versatile' brand). In this context, the few emotional and aggressive outbursts of course pack a tremendous punch.And then there is the sheer beauty of the images. The sweeping landscapes of Wyoming (actually Alberta, Canada) lend a Walt-Whitmanesque power to the relationship of the two men, and heighten the contrast with the hideous little towns where they conduct their obligatory marriages - which after a promising start recede into joyless dreariness, until, as Jack puts it, they can be conducted over the phone. Prieto's cinematography is simply breathtaking, and a random collection of frames from this film would make a great photobook.The lead actors carry the movie, and take the skill of acting to new heights. From Gyllenhaal this is no surprise, as he had already proven himself to be an actor of extraordinary calibre and versatility. His Jack Twist, notwithstanding his obvious imperfections, is instantly loveable, and his descent into increasing anger and bitterness painful to watch. It is, however, Ledger's performance that is the big surprise and the crowning glory of this film. Author Annie Proulx observed that he understood Ennis's character better than she herself did, and if ever an actor got under the skin of his character, it is here. His Ennis is like a coiled-up spring, the tremendous tension inside palpable throughout. Ledger certainly has come a long way, and more than makes up for silly excursions like 'The Brothers Grimm'. Interestingly, in a way he comes full circle with the start of his acting career, when he appeared in an Australian teen soap as a cyclist on a sports academy, struggling to come to terms with his homosexuality. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also give sterling performances as the tormented wives. Alma's Thanksgiving outburst and even more Lureen's telephone conversation with Ennis are acting feats of rare power - it is impossible to think of Hathaway returning to ""Princess Diaries"" after this, though apparently she will. Roberta Maxwell appears only briefly as Jack's mother, yet projects so much intensity into her few lines and all her facial expressions that you feel you could write a novel about the woman.Hollywood has come a long way in finally admitting a film like this to the mainstream. All the fuss surrounding it remains shocking, though; rightwing zealots and ""christian"" bishops would have you believe you're in for some gay hardcore flick, but BBM actually contains no more than the barest minimum of necessary man-on-man lovescenes. In comparison to straight-themed movies (or even to the straight lovescenes in BBM itself), there is still a long way to go.It is even more shocking that the will and the courage were still lacking to award BBM the ultimate prize it so very clearly deserved - some Academy members, like good old Tony Curtis (didn't we see him in a dress once?) refusing to even view it, thus further devaluating the meaning of the Oscar system. Good as Crash is, it has nothing of the tautness, tension and sheer personality of BBM, and even less of its raw beauty and sad, haunting atmosphere.In all, this is one of the most consistently beautiful, meaningful, and emotionally draining films I've seen in a long time - and this comes from somebody who generally cares very little for Wild West movies, the Sixties, or C&W; music. This intimate, universal tale of loss and regret puts every Hollywood megabudget production of the last three decades to shame.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1BGF4AAX5XTC6	Maxine B.	Brokeback Mountain is one of the finest films ever to come out of Hollywood in recent memory. From it's brilliant cinematography, to great acting and fantastic score, every detail of this movie is of the highest order.This beautiful and haunting love story between two poor under educated sheephearders will leave you moved for days on end. I cannot remove this movie from my consciousness. The sorrow which enveloped me at the conclusion of this movie was profound.Mr Gyllenhaal and Mr Ledger both demonstrated towering performances, especially Mr Gyllenhaal, whose Jack Twist was played with such brilliance that my heart bled for him. The wives played by Miss Williams and Miss Faris was also of excellence. Ang Lee is simply one of the finest directors gracing the planet today. The man is pure genius.As a straight female, I am well aware of the indignity and dehumanizaton that the gay community have had to endure from a straight and hateful society, but this movie really brings home the consequences of those actions. Brokeback Mountain clearly shows how, by limiting love just between a man and a women, instead of allowing love between two humans, no matter what their gender, leaves deep wounds to all involved and with distructive lifetime effects.What I also found terribly sad, was the reacton from the American straight male regarding this movie. The endless jokes and parodies from the likes of Leno to Letterman was quite disturbing. The childish and immature behavior from the straight male towards this movie has be jawdropping. So affraid and unajusted to seeing men show affection towards one another instead of that prehistoric machismo type behavior was just too for many to handle, so he reacted the only way he knew how... infantile joke after joke and parody after parody. Many of these jokes were insulting to say the least. Not even the Academy could bring itself to award best picture to this masterpiece. It was documented and rumored that many within the academy refused to watch this so called 'gay cowboy' movie or award it best picture. What an injustice.I think we will look back on this moment in time and feel embarrassed at how such a classic was nothing but fodder for a bad joke. Love between two men is always ripe for a good laugh. When in reality, Brokeback Mountain is nothing to be laughed at, and neither is love no matter what form it takes.Buy this movie and watch it with an open mind. It is quiet and it is beautiful. Trust me, you will not regret one second of those 2hrs and 10mins of your time.	5.0	Astonishing!	2006-04-17	43	35	8

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A45S6D1P309G9	"M. B. Walters ""Big Smoky Valley"""	"What is love and why do we humans fall in love against all odds sometimes?  What makes the sparks fly with one person and not another?  What makes one encounter a one night stand and another the love of a lifetime? Two people meet and destiny steps in to shape the rest of their lives.I think this movie is destined to be a classic.  It's both tragedy and romance in the style of the old masters; a modern day Romeo and Juliet, perhaps. It has so many subtle interactions and small, textural details woven in that more than one viewing is needed just to appreciate them all.This is a love story and once the ""tent scene"" is over with, you find you are also over any preconcieved ideas about it being a love story between two men.  From that point on, you see two people who are destined for heartbreak.  They try to do what they believe is right and honorable and each goes on to marry and have a family.  For 4 years they try to put their one summer of love behind them (no puns intended) but when they finally meet again, their barriers are shattered and they face the true meaning of their relationship.They give most of themselves to their traditional lifestyles and the expectations of society but their love for each other is enduring and can't be denied.  So they shave off just a small portion of their time over the years to go away, give in to their love, and to be true to themselves.As they age, the strain of this arrangemment begins to wear and they both struggle to come to terms with the paradox.I saw this movie over a week ago and I still can't stop thinking about it.  The acting is incredible and the entire cast and crew have turned out a work of art with what could easily have gone astray as the manifestation of the old joke about cowboys and sheep camps.The dynamics of the main characters are so real that I found myself associating their lifestyles and personalities to people I've known -- the way they deal with the issues, the hows and whys of how the relationship grows, even the rough and macho lifestyle Ennis leads -- made me think about how totally plausible this ""love story"" is.The high country scenery is breathtaking and it, too, is real.  You feel the cold up on the mountain, and experience the rough, hard work of life as a cowboy (or a cowboy's wife!) and your heart breaks as you watch these lives strain and perservere over the years as they just try to live their lives and make the best if it with what they've been dealt.This movie breaks all the molds and every stereotype.  These guys aren't ""gay"" in the way we've been conditioned to think of gay men.  The queen is nowhere to be found and these guys have all the foibles and mannerisms we've come to associate with the terminally macho.  They're human beings, with human emotions and actions and both virtues and vices in their everyday lives.  They are good men and they are real men, both are portayed as loving husbands and fathers.  Their relationship is very masculine and their affection is portrayed in a very masculine way.I saw this movie with my mother and my grown daughter.

Then there was either something wrong my ears, or my sound, cos Jake Gyllenhall & Heath Ledger seemed to mumble all their lines! It got very annoying, and I kept turning the sound up 'til nearly as far as it would go. Then the sex scenes are actually filmed in nearly complete darkness, so it's very difficult to see what actually is going on, but it's also very well done. But then they just seem to be sleeping, and the next thing you know is one is jumping on the other ... you know the rest.I quite liked both Jake & Heath in this, apart from the constant smoking, and the rest of the actors in this are amazing. Michelle Williams, playing a dowdy character for once in her life, is simply amazing as Ennis' on screen wife (and off screen), the scene where she discovers her husband's betrayal will bring a lump to anyone's throat, although it's implied in her previous scenes that she knows. Anne Hathaway takes her first major step away from The Princess Diaries & Ella Enchanted, by playing a bit of a cow, and doing her first blink-and-you'll-miss-it topless scene. Randy Quaid & Anna Faris also appear in this, as unrecognisable characters, I didn't actually realise it was them until reading the cast list.There is no other love story like this out there, and can play itself out without much in the way of dialogue, apart from half way through. Heath & Jake both took a major risk getting involved with this film, but they both pulled it off with little embarrassment. Ang Lee and all actors didn't shy away from the material put in front of them, they got on and did it and pulled out an unforgettable film.The ending is heartbreaking, and unforgettable, but also unpredictable. I did not see this coming. The almost final shots of their shirts together, and a postcard of Brokeback Mountain.This is a very hard film to review, second only to United 93. If you've known love, you'll be hit by a ton of bricks watching this film, it's so emotional, and really tugs at the heart strings. It's a film that some people will never see, but should.	3.0	Makes for very uncomfortable viewing	2006-06-11	21	8	13

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1AYN3IIUNQCIA	"Melanie Edwards ""book worm"""	i have to agree, Brokeback got robbed at the oscars. this is definently one of the biggest upsets like when Shakespear in Love won over the excpected Saving Private Ryan. why the film lost i can speculate is because of prejudice, theme, and all the late night jokes about it (have you seen comedy central when it came out?) i guess the academy wasent ready for a film adressing the gay theme to take home the most prestigous film award but we can look at the bright side, in a year or two we will forget about the Crash victory but Brokeback will only gain in popularity and it will become a classic like other robbed oscar films. the film has a sad tone in it and when it shows pictures of happiness its just heartbreaking. the film is about two ranchers, Ennis and Jack, who meet one summer tending sheep in the wilderness of Brokeback Mountain and by fate, fall in love. then as time goes buy they get married, have kids, but still always meet at the mountain to rekindle there love. all the performences are great, Gyllenhaal gives his best performence since the Good Girl while Hathaway comes far since her Princess diaries days. but the two standout performces are Ledger and Williams. Ledger perfectly brings a gruff, quiet Ennis to the screen with explosive results and Williams has blossomed into a pitch perfect actress potraying Ennis's tortured wife and proves she has come a long way since Dawson's creek. i have loved Ang Lee's films from Sense and Sensibilty to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but this by far is his best film to date, i wont give away the ending but i will say the shirt...just makes you want to cry. some people may shy away from the film but its a great film so i definently recomend seeing it. it is truley the best film of the year.	5.0	th best film of the year	2006-03-07	1	1	0
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A398KB08UEOCKN	Melanie	"I can't remember any other movie affected me like Brokeback Mountain did. I watched it twice and read the original short story by Annie Proulx several times. And I never before watched any other movie twice. It's been more than one week since I first watched it and I just can't get it off my mind.Yes, like some people said it's a gay cowboy love story; but more than that it is about pure and unconditional love between two human beings. When watched the movie I forgot both Jack and Ennis are men, mesmerzied by their deeply charged feeling for each other and felt sorrw for the tragic depressing life they lived. Under the directing of Ang Lee actors Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal put their whole feelings and minds into these charaters to create unforgetable images of two people in love. When Ennis held the blood-stained shirts to his chest and inhaled it deeply and murmured:'Jack, I swear..., I couldn't hold my tears any more. No other movie moved my so much.I think Brokeback Mountain really is a cultural watershed consider so many Holywood movies nowadays are full of violence, criminal acts, sex, lust, car chasings, guns... Brokeback Mountain is so refreshing and unique no wonder it has received so many rewards and tons of rave reviews.Of course like it says no such things as perfect, same for Brokeback Mountain. I feel little regrets that some details in the short story, which actually are very important to show the sparkling feeling beween Jake and Ennis, are not showing in the movie: When Ennis lead Jake to his home and meet his wife first time they see each other in four years they hardly can control their feelings. In the original story:'""You got a kid?"" said Jack, His shaking hand grazed Ennis's hand, electrical current snapped between them.'... Another one:'From the vibration of the floorboard on which they both stood Ennis could feel how hard Jack was shaking.' I guess probably it is very diffcult for the actors to express such subtle movements. Or I didn't notice it?I read a lot of reviews about Brokeback Mountain and found many different opinions such as 'love beween gay people,' 'social prejudice against gay people,' 'wives and children are victims,' I think these opinions are not wrong at all.But after all, as the director Ang Lee pointed out, it is simple about love."	5.0	Wonderful	2006-05-28	35	30	5

A common complaint seems to be, ""well, if this movie was about a man and a woman, no one would care.""  To me, that's what makes this such an engaging breath of fresh air!  Sure, it involves two dudes in the wilderness experiencing love but the movie itself is so focused on telling a good LOVE story that you don't even think about the gay aspect (well, you forget if you're not homophobic).  Quite simply, this movie is beautiful, all the way from the miraculous acting, to the directing, to the cinematography to the gorgeous score music.  It all weaves in and out of each other bringing together a genuinely original movie experience which is SO rare in the theater these days.I've noticed many people have noted they couldn't get Brokeback Mountain out of their heads days after seeing it.  I fall under this category as well. Brokeback Mountain is so deeply emotional that anyone who has ever had their heart broken will be fighting off ghosts for quite some time.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2MLP4UGTF1RX4	"M. FUSCO ""yawnmower"""	One of the truly great American films has been made by a Chinese director, an Argentinian composer, and an Australian lead actor.Ang Lee has captured the loneliness, intolerance, and violence of the American west as no one else has. There may be a few tiny false notes, mostly in plot devices fleshing out the short story, but Mr. Lee has created an intimate, genuine, masterful, epic film which portrays a region, time, and two star-crossed lovers who find each other in 1963.The film follows their passionate, private, and devoted friendship for 20 years. Jake Gyllenhaal is extraordinary as rodeo cowboy Jack Twist, who begins as a sweet, soft-spoken, sensuous young man, and grows into a loving, self-assured man who knows what he wants.  Heath Ledger paints a deeply moving portrait of the taciturn ranch hand Ennis Del Mar, whose still waters run very deep, indeed.  Yet he cannot satisfy anyone -- himself least of all. Torment is etched on his face, but can be verbalized only in extreme circumstances.  His passive/aggressive character triggers all the major and minor tragedies of this multi-level, heart-breaking story.The musical score is gorgeous, and perfectly complements the magnificent photography and scenery. Be sure to watch the credits, because Rufus Wainright's beautifully simple accompanying song sums up the entire film with remarkable sentiment and heartfelt aplomb.	5.0	study in loneliness	2006-05-01	55	46	9

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1TJPMB7N776WS	MICHAEL ACUNA	"Love has no rules. It happens  when we least expect it, often when we don't want it, many times when we can't handle it. It often times scares you, surprises you, shakes you down to your very core. Ennis Del Mar (a remarkable Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (an emotionally available Jake Gyllenhaal) find themselves thrown together because of a job:  forced to spend many hours together alone in the wild, tending to sheep in a remote region of Wyoming....on Brokeback Mountain. They fall in love: a love that they soon realize only lives and breathes on the mountain.It's 1963, pre American involvement in the Vietnam War, post Korean War: a time in the USA when life was simple, straightforward and the lines between the sexes and sex roles were crisply drawn and severely delineated. It was a time when men and women were pigeon-holed into unrealistic modes of behavior and anyone who ventured outside of these boundaries was thought of at best, weird at worst... perverted and in many states, criminal. Ennis himself, at an early age was witness to the ugly, disgusting results of a hate crime perpetrated on a Wyoming farmer who had lived many years with his partner. In most societies he would be venerated but in 1950's Wyoming... he became a target.Director Ang Lee begins this film as both Ennis and Jack are waiting outside of a building, both looking for work, both down on their luck, both avoiding each other's eyes. We know, or those of us who have read the story know, what is to happen and so unfortunately we read more into that simple scene than there really is. But with all that aside, this scene of Ennis and Jack avoiding each other, dodging each others looks, staring at the ground, kicking up the dirt is nonetheless rife with sensuality and tension.Ennis and Jack are inexorably drawn to each other through their proximity, loneliness and through a shared lack of tenderness and emotion in their lives: they are emotionally, physically and psychically bonded almost from the start. It is inevitable. It is Fate.And so begins a Love affair that transcends social mores, time, marriages, children, extra-marital affairs and divorce.Despite all that is going on in their lives, Ennis and Jack meet several times a year up on Brokeback mountain  and  rekindle and thereby re-ignite their emotional and physical attraction: there is no one around, they are free from their regular lives...they can love.Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance as Ennis and he gives what is without a doubt one of the finest performances of this year. Ennis is a quiet, stoic man and he is troubled and frankly scared by how deeply he feels for Jack. As he showed us first in ""Monster's Ball,"" Ledger is capable of digging way deep down into his gut and imbuing his performances with an unflinching frankness and truth that we can neither ignore nor help to be moved by.Gyllenhall's Jack is the younger of the two: he's fun, he's a little crazy and unfortunately he wants a lot, lot more than Ennis is able to give him. Gyllenhaal's hang-dog, frisky puppy of a performance is full of warmth and light: the kind of transcendent light that shines out from a soul full of love, understanding and acceptance.""Brokeback Mountain"" is devastating in both its presentation, its performances and its tragic denouement. This movie is not for everyone. But if you are willing to open up your heart and mind a bit to let in its beauty, emotionality and sensuality you will not be disappointed. In fact... you will be renewed."	5.0	Ennis and Jack	2005-12-15	1818	1658	160
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2G6GO4O7EVCPF	Michael Bolts	Brokeback Mountain is of course the movie about Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, 2 cowboys who spend one summer up on Brokeback Mountain together with the sheep. Along the way they make love to one another in which case Ennis says he isnt that way. They dont want anyone else to know about it so they keep it a secret. Ennis' wife Alma Del Mar is played by the wonderful Michelle Williams (The Baxter, Dawson's Creek). They have a daughter as well. Jack falls in love with rodeo girl Lureen Newsome played by cutie Anne Hathaway (Havoc, Princess Diaries 1 & 2). They have a son together. Jack gets in contact with Ennis and the two of them spend time fishing which is what they do but also their love for each other grows. Alma right away discovers the secret hiding and bottling it up inside of her all throughout. I ignore the bad reviews and snippy remarks and the jokes and just watch the movie and I thought it was pretty good for what it is. Heath Leger (Lords of Dogtown, Casanova) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Jarhead) give superb performances. The scene in which Gyllenhaal yells at his step-father to sit down was a great scene...I was waiting for Gyllenhaal to deck that guy. I had to put subtitles on half way for Ledger because some times he'd talk real low and I couldnt understand what he said but I got it all. Do I think it was snubbed at Oscar time? Uh, it was but I did liked Crash. The cinematography is great. Also starring Randy Quaid (The Ice Harvest, Independence Day), Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1-4 million, Just Friends), Linda Cardellini (Scooby-Doo 1&2, Grandma's Boy) and Graham Beckel (Blue Streak, Black Dog).	3.0	Pretty good movie with great performances by the 2 leads	2006-04-10	26	4	22
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2BON03VAFS1SZ	Michael Fishman	Is beautiful cinematography enough to make a movie? This was a beautifully filmed movie and a joy to watch from that standpoint, but it was also overlong and very slowly paced and offered no real character motivation or development. Brokeback Mountain is based on a 20-page short story, and I learned more about the characters in those 20 pages than I did in this two plus hour movie and that bothered me. The other thing that bothered me about the movie was while it took place over the course of nearly 20 years, there were really no visible signs of aging in the two main characters. Longer sideburns and a mustache on Jack and that was supposed signify the passage of time?In the short story it's very clear why Ennis is so hesitant to pursue his relationship with Jack and I really think they needed to do more in the movie to make that information known than the thirty seconds they gave it. For whatever reason, they decided that information wasn't important, or maybe they wanted us to try and come to our own conclusions, but as a result, the tragedy of the love story is completely lost along with all the social issues surrounding their relationship. I can't deny the movie was emotional, but I think with some character motivation it could have been much more that it was. It could have been a love story that was remembered for the relationship between the two principle characters. As it stands now, it will be remembered, but only because it dared to deal with a taboo topic and that's not only unfortunate, but insulting.I thought Heath Ledger was very good in the movie and I think he deserved the Oscar nomination. After seeing the movie I wouldn't have been unhappy had he actually won, but maybe that's based more on my bias of rewarding actors with Oscars for doing impersonations in movies, as opposed to acting a character. Jake Gyllenhaal proved to me that he's nothing but an average actor who's yet to move beyond his work in Bubble Boy.Brokeback Mountain wasn't a bad movie, but it also wasn't a very good movie, or a movie that made a lot of sense and I think most of the attention it received was because of hype. Too bad, because, as I mentioned earlier, with some character development and motivation this could have been a really good love story.I understand how the movie won the Oscar for best screenplay from previously published material since the writers had to take a 20 minute short story and convert it into a 2 hour and 10 minute movie.I recommend Brokeback Mountain only to someone interested in seeing beautiful cinematography.	2.0	Beautifully filmed, but overlong and very slow - read the short story instead	2011-02-14	16	3	13

I'll just say that the film captures the loneliness of Wyoming perfectly then perfectly transposes it to the lives of the characters.  Ang Lee just has to win the academy award for this one thing alone. Masterpeice is not too strong a word.The one point that the film makes, and I think has been lost in all the ""gay hoopla"", is the collateral damage in the lives of the people forced to live as someone they are not. Look at the families of the two lead characters.  Both suffered immeasurably because of the lie their husbands/fathers were forced to live. I would tell the religious right and anyone who wants gay people to fake their lives by pretending to be straight to consider the others in the equation. Even if you can never understand homosexuality yourself have some feelings for the people who will spend their lives confused and hurt, perhaps never understanding why their spouse/father is so emotionally unavailable to them.Days after seeing this film it still resonates with me.

Perhaps I'm a little intimidated by this film and a little nervous at summarizing it for the Amazon community.  Nonetheless, here is my tardy entry.Jack and Ennis (two teenage ranch hands) meet by chance and work together in the most rough and unforgiving of environments, tending to and herding sheep in the mountains of Wyoming one summer.  To their great surprise (and to the surprise of their boss,) they develop a physical and (eventually) emotional love for each other that neither had experienced before (and neither probably will again.)This film chronicles their attempts to exist in the ""real world,"" i.e. the ""straight"" world, with each of their wives and children, as they struggle to define and sustain their relationship with each other through the years.If you can't fall in love, just a little, with either Jack or Ennis (or both,) this film won't probably affect you much.  I am struck by how much more I was moved by this film on the big screen.  But on DVD, the whole is still there; you just have to pay attention a little more and thankfully use the volume and rewind buttons (which aren't available in the theater.)  It's a study in love and courage, relationships, expectations, and society.  Love lands where it wants.I cannot remember a film which has inspired so much need in me to visit endless chat sites and the movie site, watch the trailer ceaselessly, buy BBM ""merchandise"" on eBay.  Though this is not a happy film, there are moments of overwhelming and intense joy that carry you through the sadness and melancholy and make the journey worthwhile.I would not dare to voice any criticism of this film, but would only comment that the lack of clarity in some of the dialog, particularly Ennis, makes for a frustrating experience at times.  (Thorough discussions of the dialog in question can be found on the Internet.)  Probably the most satisfying explanations are found in one's own heart.

Now that the recent, disgraceful Academy Awards ceremony is history, the legacy of ""Brokeback Mountain' will begin to grow in the aftermath of unbelievable stupidity on the part of card-carrying A.M.P.A.S. members.""Brokeback Mountain"" is too great a movie to be merely tagged with ""The Academy Award Winning Best Picture"" label, a distinction that carries less and less weight, it seems to me, with each passing year. The amount of detritus picked as ""Best Picture"" in Oscar's past is truly staggering, so in a way ""Brokeback Mountain"" has received a backhanded compliment from ""The Academy"". The film joins an impressive list of magnficant losers: ""The Grapes Of Wrath"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre"", ""A Place In The Sun"", ""High Noon"", ""Giant""....the list goes on and on.""Brokeback Mountain' did manage to win three well deserved Oscars. Ang Lee's direction is brilliant, bringing alive a 20 year saga with the resonance of an epic novel. McMurty and Ossana's adaptation of Annie Proulx's eloquent short story is a model of craft, enriching the original tale with embellishments to characters and plot only hinted at in the source material. Gustavo Santaollala's original music score adds further power to the proceedings with plaintive themes and melodies evoking love and loss in the big wide open spaces. Last but not least, Rodrigo Prieto's stunning cinematography (which lost to ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"") surrounds the viewer in a world both majestic (those picturesque mountain pastures) and mundane ( drab Texas towns and  weathered Wyoming ranches).There were other fine movies released in 2005. In fact, three of the Best Picture nominees from that year are likely to endure in the years to come. ""Capote"". ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" and ""Munich"" were superb films. However, ""Brokeback Mountain"" was far and away the most striking movie of 2005.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A23DWPG5UMSXKF	"Michael Smith ""saintzak"""	"I think Brokeback Mountain has been transformed into something well beyond a movie. People either kneel before it lavishing uwarrented praise or villify it in the most degrading and hateful terms. But it really is just a movie.Coco Channel famously said, ""Never add. Take away."" Brokeback Mountain was based on Annie Proulx's short story...SHORT story. How it ended up a movie well in excess of 2 hours is a mystery to me. It feels padded and bloated. Proulix used such spare language that she kept her story in brutal focus. The movie loses its way. The beginning scenes and the ending scenes are dead on. The look, the feel...they fit Proulix's original material like a glove. Its the vast middle section where things go very wrong. So much material has been added and embellished concerning the two men's marriages and wives that their relationship with each other becomes background. The movie becomes more a study of the failed marriages than an exploration of their profound bond. That element played as a tragic backdrop in the original story. The tragedy of these two men carried mysery in its wake. In some ways I felt we learned more about the wives than the cowboys in this film. The mid section becomes kind of ponderous and slow.When Ang Lee succeeds he does so greatly. The entire early part is excellent. From the opening seconds when the two men first see each other the attraction is unmistakable. Their ""romance"" is not treated in typical Hollywood style of guazy close-ups, longing eyes and trembling lips. Its very real and natural, told in subtle posing, stolen glances, gradual opening up and fear of making that first move. After that first move has been made Ennis and Jack seem completely natural and comfortable with each other. Its very real. Jump ahead to the end, and it once again finds its heart. A paunchy, middle-aged Jack bitterly confronting Ennis with all the ""what ifs"" and ""we should haves"" that their lives have come down to is very effective and sets up the sad and dismal end very well. Wisely the end is also not treated in typical Hollywood fashion. Ennis' visit with Jack's parents is a study in things not spoken. The end is certainly depressing and profoundly sad, but never resorts to sentimental Hollywood tearjerking. Its a very raw and honest finish. Lee never presents us with a typical villain who embodies the prejudice and bigotry. It pervades the whole movie like a smothering force. Lee keeps an emotional distance and seems to simply point his camera at a very sad story. The approach makes it very universal.The performances are wonderful. Heath Ledger certainly deserves all the praise he's gotten. He completely disappears in this role and the effect is amazing. Jake Gyllenhaal is also excellent. Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife is very effective, but Anne Hathaway is pretty weak. Randy Quaid is great in his small role and while he illustrates bigotry and contempt perfectly he never turns into a cartoon. Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie as Jack's parents are wonderful. He can barely contain his disgust and disappointment. She is a study in heartbreak and hidden understanding.If 30 minutes had been cut out of the mid section this would have been an excellent movie."	3.0	Its only a movie	2005-12-27	44	19	25
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2R9J5LULVKF6T	Michael T. Rognlien	It's funny to me that on the cusp of the year 2006, there are those who still feel the need to water down the point of this movie in order to make it more palatable to the general movie-going public.This IS a gay movie, and it's about time.  Having sat through hundreds of variations on My Best Friend's Wedding or some other 'chick flick' with both straight female friends and gay male friends, I can honestly say that this film has been a lifetime in coming for me.  I suppose that if you're not a gay man you can't relate to this very important point, but after a lifetime of having to rewrite hundreds of movies in my head after leaving the theater to dream what it would be like to see a movie about love between two men, especially one starring two headlining straight men, it is a seminal moment.This is not a chick flick; there are no dashing leading men and there is no clearly defined happily-ever-after.. but what there IS is the indelible impression of the hell-and-back reality that many thousands of gay men have gone through while traveling the slow road to acceptance.  40+ years after the story in this movie started, the journey continues.  The making and the success of this movie, in my opinion, is one of the milestones on that road.I've never quite felt like I felt when I left the theater after seeing this movie, but I am so thankful that it was made, that it was made WELL, and that if only one non-gay person out there has the lightbulb moment that we love and lose and love again just like everyone else, it will serve more than as just a greaet cinematic experience but one that opens the eyes and the hearts of others.	5.0	Unforgettable	2005-12-18	53	43	10

The cast all do a good job, especially Ledger and Williams, who deserve the Oscar nominations they received.  The story, however, was unremarkable to me.  The only thing that makes it ""special"" is that the two leads are gay, or at least bi-sexual.  And that will be the downfall of the movie for many.  Finally, the movie feels longer than it is.  135 minutes is a lot to ask for this story, and that hurts the film too.  I cannot recommend this movie, but I do think that it will find a appreciative audience with some."	3.0	Brokeback Mountain	2006-02-09	30	9	21

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ASVY2J1ICVB5U	miditrax	Okay, I went to see this 'gay cowboy movie'. I'll compare it with another Western I saw this year - AN UNFINISHED LIFE. First the good - this film is beautifully shot. You'll enjoy the scenery of the mountain locations, and Ang Lee even makes Texas attractive. The acting is good- there may be some Academy nominations for the leads. The sexual couplings are graphic but not pornographic, along with the language and some violence, earning the R rating.The story and setting is also very true to mid-20th-century rural life. The braggadicio, poverty, social strictures and prejudices are all there. These characters live on the knife-edge of patriotism, straight-laced religion and rebellion from it, and all the soul-shattering hypocrisy that results. And it's very 'white' - minorities are relegated to the periphery. Having lived through a similar upbringing it all rang uncomfortably true.But unlike UNFINISHED LIFE, there are no lessons learned here. No forgiveness given. No reconciliation - just the spectacle of social norms broken and lives ruined all around. If you think this is anti-gay bias, do what I did - Substitute a female for one of the male leads, and you'll see this is one of several 'love affair' movies like AMERICAN BEAUTY that detail the desperation of loveless marriages and the devastation that follows from straying from them. The love depicted here may be 'true', but it is also VERY selfish, just as all extramarital affairs are. Watch the look on one wife's face as she realizes the truth. See her pain! The director does a very good job of detailing this tragedy.	3.0	Good but not Great	2005-12-28	42	12	30
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1OUHW8VG89Q0Z	"Miho Hirono ""ex-musician"""	"I saw this film recently, because it started showing last week in Japan, I feel this is very unusual film as an American film not only because of gay cowboy story. This film tells about a beautiful tragedy of painful love.I hadn't been satisfied by serious love stories by American films while I love American romantic comedies. I had been feeling there was something missing, something deep, wet, pain, hiding in words.. I am not sure. So I prefered Europian or Asian films for serious love story.""Brokeback Mountain"" is going to be exception for me, that you can see emotion of the characters which is not talked by words.I read the original story by Annie Proulx in advance, and another surprise was the film was so close to the original.When novels turn to films there are some differences and usually the film is not good enough to show the world suggested by the original story. Of course there are some differences between them in ""Brokeback Mountain"" but this is a rare film that neither dissapointed me nor made me feel strange.Annie Proulx says she put the climax of the story in Motel scene where Ennis and Jack get together in four years, but Ang Lee put the climax in their last painful meeting. I think Ang Lee got the point. For me, it was the scene impress me the most during reading the story. And it was good starting at the first meeting Ennis and Jack while the original story starts with Ennis's suffering life after Jack's death.I recomend you to read the original story that help you to feel more power of Brokeback Mountain than just seeing the movies."	5.0	A beauty of painful love	2006-03-23	45	34	11
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2EF9QR59RZY63	"mike ""ATTY"""	"Now that I have your attention, I went to this movie expecting nothing considering the media hype surrounding its pre-release. That is pretty much what I got. First,  I will admit that the movie is not a bad movie, just amateurish in alot of respects. For example, we have 2 aimless drifters (one who wears a white hat, and the other a black hat..hmmm...) who manage somehow to ""fall in lust"" one long ""hot"" summer. At the end of the day, however, we have no idea whether its lust or love, was it just 2 bored and horny men taking care of business or a deep love that transcends societal constraints (something the gay establishment would like us to believe). Well, after 4 years of no contact (during which white hat gets married and has 2 kids based on an obligation to marry a woman--what a concept!, black hat gets married for money to a girl he meets after a failed attempt to pick up a guy at a bar) they reunite....and the rest is history.I found this movie overly long and tedious to the point of disbelief. The two characters are in their own way ridiculous. Black hat is clearly an opportunist both sexually and financially who has no qualms about leaving hearth and home to take up with white hat who to his credit (at least for the first half of the movie) maintains his dignity by at least pretending to stand by his commitment to his wife and children. However, by the last half of this movie, white hat seems a bit off since by now its the late '70s, the Village People are in full drag, and being gay is tres chic..he still stays way way in the closet while black hat is prowling anywhere he can to get off (that includes Mexico, a buddy in town, and God only knows who and what else). Of course, black hat meets his end at the hands of ignorant folk (or so we should believe) that has nothing whatsoever to do with his choices in life....and white hat goes to lead a miserable existence without black hat (he was apparently going to have to do anyway since it appeared that black hat had found someone else and was about to ditch white hat, what a love story!!!)....considering white hat's moribund personality, this was a foregone conclusion.Overall, I would recommend renting this movie for no other reason than seeing how Hollywood and the gay establishment got it wrong. There is nothing uplifting about seeing 2 men in love, or lust, or whatever you call it, lieing to themselves and the people around them to no end other than to make life miserable for everyone involved."	2.0	BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN IS FANTABULOUS!	2006-03-18	153	14	139

Not only does this movie combined a emotionally moving script and world renowned conducting, but the actors and actresses also stayed true to the characters. You literally feel the boundaries between you and the story, and the actors and their characters shatter, placing you in a new reality; one that you have never witnessed before.Though this movie does have minor flaws (such as the lack of aging and the characters aren't the best examples of humanity) It is surprising how people can use these flaws against these movies. Such actions demonstrate a lack of intelligence, since much more can be said about all other movies today. Nevertheless, this movie will remain in history for years to come, and it is my hope that every person living today at least have one copy of this amazing movie in their movie collection.	5.0	Truly Deserve a 5-Star Status	2006-06-01	26	23	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A14I5G49AL0Y9R	"MikeONYC ""MikeONYC"""	"This is a wonderful film, with only a single major flaw. The direction is really remarkable -- Ang Lee should be given the Oscar now, why waste time? His direction make's Heath Ledger's rather stoic performance almost magical, and gives Jake G.'s histrionics the right tone. Particularly unique is the scene with Jack's parents at the end of the movie. Really amazing.But -- and for me it was a big but, the movie sounds one strident and false note, and I assume the fault comes from the novel. (Plot giveaway coming...) The film leaves virtually no stone unturned in making it clear to us that gays are victims of a brutal and uncaring society. In case we weren't getting the message, we are shown the dead rancher with his genitals ripped off. That's fine -- it's a formative trauma for Ennis. The two star-crossed lovers struggle with their love in an immensely moving story. I was completely drawn in, 100% sold, empathizing, sympathizing, emoting.Then, we are treated to the flash of Jack getting his head bashed in. Literally getting beaten over the head with the hate crime message that this movie had already given us in no uncertain terms. So, we have a tender, beautiful and subtle film filled with moving performances, astonishing direction, exquisite photography and understated elegance turned, in one five-second clip, into a PC gays-as-victims ""hate crime"" agenda film replete with head-bashing.Is it possible that anyone who would go see this movie did not get the message before that clip? Would the movie have been any less moving if Jack had committed suicide, or self-destructed some other way? Or even just sailed off into the sunset in his false and empty life, leaving Ennis?This story, and this movie, would have had so much more artistic value without slipping into the whole hate crime mode. Is there really a single sane person in this country who condones murdering someone for their sexual orientation? Do we think the police or FBI do not investigate such crimes equally with other murders? Do we need to be convinced on this issue -- that murder is bad, whatever the reason? Of the 16,000 murders in the US in 2003, perhaps 6 could have been classified as anti-male gay hate crimes. Is that an epidemic that needs to be staunched with a major Hollywood film? Did ""Boys Don't Cry"" stop the epidemic of murders of transgender women in Texas?So now, we ask, why would someone kill a man just because he was gay? A reasonable answer would be from a severe emotional dysfunction or instability which made the person fear homosexuality. A crime of emotion and fear. Sort of like shooting your wife for cheating, or drowning your kids because you can't provide for them... My point is ALL these crimes are equally bad, but this movie had a much more important message to send. The beautifully-depicted love between these two conflicted men let us see the reality of a gay relationship in a way no film has before. We even saw the unconditional love of a mother, and a father who refused to allow his son's sexuality to define his life or his death. The writers did not need to bash Jake G's head in to get the message across. Too bad.I wonder if you are allowed to criticize this film?"	4.0	One False Note	2006-02-03	29	9	20
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1FAZMVUSQWEQT	Mike Sarzo	"Like other movies in a similar vein to Brokeback Mountain, such as Les Rouseaux Sauvages or several foreign films, this movie has at its center a story of love between two men. With all the debate and controversy surrounding Brokeback Mountain, the uninitiated might think the movie was all about vivid sex between the characters played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Lending itself to that is the tendency of many people to dub this movie ""the gay cowboy movie.""I rarely watch movies, but when two men, one a co-worker and the other a close friend of mine I think of as a brother, both watched the movie within days of each other, I had to shell out the money and see this movie. When I went in, I was thinking that I might get a charge out of seeing Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger either making out or possibly doing more than that. However, when I left the theater, I left with the feeling that what I saw was an emotionally intense experience.Let's get the ""controversy"" part out of the way early. There is perhaps two minutes of ""action"" between Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) out of a movie lasting nearly two hours. More important to the movie is the emotional journey the characters make as the film progresses. Important to me was seeing how the characters handled the love scenes, especially with Gyllenhaal's concern that the scenes be ""authentic."" With Twist being the one more likely to wear his heart on his sleeve, I was especially keen to see how Gyllenhaal portrayed Twist's love for Del Mar. From the deep feeling of love Twist felt for Del Mar in one sex scene to the bitter ""I just don't know how to quit you"" later in the movie, the viewer can feel those emotions along with Gyllenhaal, along with the wistful, sunny optimism that sometimes gets in the way of pragmatism forced on him by society.I make the distinction between Twist and Del Mar for a reason. Del Mar is by far the more emotionally withdrawn of the two and rarely ever speaks more than a few words, especially in the early going. In fact, when Twist and Del Mar meet for the first time, Twist has to ask twice to get Del Mar's last name after Twist freely introduced himself with his first and last name. Later in the movie, the emotional journey the viewer accompanies Del Mar on reaches a climax when Del Mar meets Twist's parents and leaves their home with one of Twist's outfits.After leaving the movie, I recalled people saying something about going back to ""their Brokeback Mountain"" and thinking about relationships they had with friends or lovers that the movie invoked. If you don't go watch the movie, you won't know how true that really is."	5.0	You can't go home again... or can you?	2006-02-13	33	26	7

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"I love Annie Proulx's original story of ""Brokeback Mountain"" more than any other piece of contemporary literature, and I wanted to love Ang Lee's film as much as I love the story. I do like the film a lot, and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal embody Ennis and Jack magnificently; they give two of the greatest, most courageous and most moving performances in any recent American film. Yet, in my opinion, the film doesn't quite deserve the highest rating. Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana write wonderful dialogue, and McMurtry unquestionably knows more about how cowboys act, talk and think than any other living author, with the possible exception of Proulx. Yet, in expanding Proulx's story for the screen, McMurtry and Ossana add some not-very-interesting new characters, and make some slight but annoying changes to the original that dilute its impact. (Their screenplay is indeed beautiful and tear-inducing, but Proulx's original leaves readers with their guts ripped out.) As for Lee's direction, he obviously is a masterful director of actors; every performance is perfect, and Michelle Williams equals Ledger and Gyllenhaal as Ennis' wife Alma, a nice, beleaguered young woman who discovers her husband's secret in a way no woman could ever forgive. Lee also captures some heartbreakingly beautiful scenes of the Rockies and Great Plains with the help of his superb photographer, Rodrigo Prieto. But he lingers too long on those scenes, so that a film that should have been a punchy, concentrated 90 minutes drags on for two-and-a-quarter hours. The basic story, however, still gets under our skin in a way few stories ever do, and Ledger and Gyllenhaal (as stated before) can't be faulted in any way. Ledger is particularly impressive as an archetypal cowboy--hot-blooded but emotionally reticent, quicker with his fists than his tongue--who finds himself drawn into a love that everything in his previous experience tells him is a death sentence. Gyllenhaal, with his puppy-dog eyes and lopsided grin, makes us feel his character's ardent emotional needs with touching immediacy. I just wish the film as a whole was as great as they are. The relevance of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" however, could not be clearer: even as all America is weeping over the plight of Ennis and Jack, the Virginia legislature--marching in lockstep with Ohio and other states--just voted overwhelmingly to ban same-sex marriage within the commonwealth. I wish I could find out who the hypocrites are--the delegates who voted for the ban while pretending to have been moved by this film."	4.0	Wonderful in many ways, but not quite what it could have been.	2006-01-09	16	6	10

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AUSATFDSU2INS	"milss ""Yellow hair warrior"""	The cinematographic achievements of Brokeback Mountain have been buried under the controversy generated by its argument: a homosexual relationship between two cowboys. Of course, such scandal was to be expected, because if there's a stereotype more traditional and almost sacred in the United States, is the rude and very masculine cowboy.The western is a genre associated with a misogynistic point of view, always related with iconic figures such as Clint Eastwood and the very macho John Wayne; so, from this limited scoop, it's not rare that Brokeback Mountain put itself in the eye of a storm.Based on a short novel written by Annie Proulx, the movie narrates the story between two men for almost twenty years. When they meet in the 60's, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two young kids hired to watch a herd of sheep. Ennis is the quiet, shy one, engaged to marry Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack is the free-spirited one, always happy, optimistic and a first-class dreamer. In Brokeback Mountain, both men surrender their souls to a forbidden love, and after doing this, they return to their routines, hoping to put behind a life-changing experience that would chase them forever.The years pass, and Jack and Ennis have their very decent and normal families. Until one day, they meet again. And this meeting marks the turbulent, painful and harrowing beginning of a prohibited and irregular relationship, with devastating consequences.Social prejudices, hypocritical morals, intolerance an narrow minds are some of the obstacles that Ennis and Jack's love must endure. The other obstacle, the worst, is their battle with themselves. Jack, more open and clear about what he wants, what happiness means to him, is more willing to make choices that will cost him, but he'll do them anyway. Ennis is more cautious, in part because he's incapable of admit who he really is, what are his true feelings, always afraid of what people will think, afraid of rejection, afraid of speak freely about his emotions.And here is where Brokeback Mountain succeeds. It's not an ordinary movie about two guys having sex or making out. It's a movie about a love that aspires, above everything, the freedom to love without censorship; a love that seeks respect, dignity and the opportunity to be lived at its fullest. Director Ang Lee has beautifully crafted one of the greatest love stories of all times, one that will transcend its characters. Slow, with a gorgeous cinematography and a paused tone, Brokeback Mountain is simply a moving and tragic tale of two secret lovers; and these lovers could very well be heterosexual. But then, who would find this original and interesting?	5.0	A tender story of a prohibited love	2006-05-23	18	16	2

In fact, as I argue in [...] its main characters lose interest in what label to put on themselves after a while and simply wish to BE. This is an even more profound lesson than the need to accept homosexuality. It is to not limit one's choices by self-labeling. Regardless of one's beliefs about his or her sexual orientation there may be situatiuons where they find themselves inexplicably drawn to someone that defies these preconceptions. They should allow themselves to experience these""out of character"" moments without self-censorship (e.g., ""Oh, I'm a _________ I shouldn't be feeling this and wanting that.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"""Brokeback Mountain"" is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx about two men who, young and poor, meet in 1963 when they tend a herd of sheep for the summer on Wyoming's Brokeback Mountain. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is laconic, introverted and plans to marry shortly. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an outgoing rodeo jock, estranged from his family, who dreams of better things. Isolated and increasingly attracted by their mutual differences, the two men have a passionate affair. When the summer is over, Ennis marries his sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams), and they start a family. Jack moves up in the world by marrying Lureen (Anne Hathaway), the rebellious daughter of a well-to-do farm equipment distributor in Texas. Ennis and Jack see one another sporadically over the next couple of decades on fishing trips where they rekindle their relationship, and Jack becomes increasingly frustrated with Ennis' resignation that their association can never be more than occasional and secretive.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a story of cowboys, but it is not a ""Western"" genre film. It's an ""epic love story"" genre film in the sense of being a stock story of 2 people who fall in love in their youth and are kept apart by social conventions. We've all seen this plot a thousand times, but ""Brokeback Mountain"" fails to convince as either ""epic"" or ""love story"". Annie Proulx's short story is intimate and focused. The material isn't suitable for an epic. The film doesn't have the production values to pull it off anyway. The 1.85:1 format doesn't flatter the Wyoming landscapes, and attempts at grand vistas undermine the core tension in the plot. As to the love story, I don't see it. There is no chemistry between Ennis and Jack and no evidence of undying love. Ennis and Jack seem like buddies who get the hots for one another now and again. Their fishing trips come across simply as nostalgia for a time when they were young and happy, not stolen moments of desperate love. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, the short story gives the same impression. But it's clearly not what the film's screenwriters or director intended.The filmmakers intended a love story with a message (so they've said). For that, the actors needed help from the editor and cinematographer. The short story has no such agenda. Annie Proulx's story succeeds precisely because it focuses on the intimate relationship between these 2 men to the exclusion of everything else. The film shows us a lot of open spaces and wide angles. Poorly chosen lenses and landscapes make it difficult, if not impossible, for Jack and Ennis' alleged frustration and desperation to come through. Poorly chosen cuts and excessive length dilute the main storyline. Forty-five minutes should and could easily have been cut from the film to focus its emotions. Screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana intended to ""flesh out"" Annie Proulx's story. But instead they stretched it out and watered it down with extraneous material. Alma, who is a credible, embittered character in the short story, has been made weak and weepy. Her acrimony is transferred to Lureen. Ennis comes across simply as someone who can't decide what he wants, and Jack as someone who always wants things that are out of reach. The trouble is that the movie is about two men deeply in love. Supposedly. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is excessively long, unfocused, and unconvincing.The DVD (Universal 2006): There are 4 featurettes. ""On Being a Cowboy"" (6 min) includes interviews with the cast, director Ang Lee, stunt coordinator, and animal wranglers on how the actors learned to ride and rope. ""Directing from the Heart: Ang Lee"" (8 min) includes interviews with the cast, producers, and cinematographer in which they speak about Ang Lee. Lee himself talks about the film's dramatic themes. In ""From Script to Screen: Interviews with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana"" (11 min), the screenwriters talk about adapting Annie Proulx's story, which takes up only half of the screenplay. No kidding. (A bit of sarcasm there.) ""Sharing the Story: The Making of Brokeback Mountain"" (20 min) is a ""Logo Movie Special"" documentary made for television about making the film, from preparing the actors to filming in Canada, to audience reactions.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A13PH2F9LAMASI	M. J. Kenoyer	"Along with ""Walk the Line"" and ""Constant Gardner,"" this movie tops my best-of list for last year's film offerings. It is a poignant love story sans the melodrama or political heavy-handedness often present in gay/lesbian-themed movies. Ang Lee is such a deft filmmaker that I forgot I was watching a quote-unquote ""gay-themed"" movie at all, but simply a story of two star-crossed lovers whose lives and families are devastated in the wake of their tragic affair.For those reviewers who are dishing the ""infidelity"" of the movie's protagonists as a cover for their homophobia, that is a lame and rather transparent excuse. I don't see these same reviewers (AND pundits on TV, no less) raising holy hell about films such as ""Fatal Attraction,"" ""The English Patient,"" ""Unfaithful,"" or even the more recent ""Walk the Line""--all of which involve (heterosexual) infidelity. Tell me, where is the rage, you homophobes?Anyhoo, whatever your prejudices may be, put them aside for two hours and prepare to lose yourself in ""Brokeback"". Everything about this film is first-rate: the script adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story is flawless and natural; the acting is exceptional (especially from real-life couple Michelle Williams and Heath Ledger in their portrayal of their characters' ill-fated marriage); and the cinematography and scenery are breathtaking. The musical score, like the film itself, is nuanced, subtle, and emotionally-charged in a quiet way without being over-the-top and gushing.If you cannot put aside your tendencies to make people who are not like you ""less than,"" then your refusal to watch this excellent movie is truly your loss."	5.0	I'm a straight married woman, and I LOVED this movie!	2006-04-02	44	37	7

It's a fear story.This is the story of how some people can be utterly controlled by the fears they have.  To me love didn't conquer all.  It is a story about how bigotry absolutely does produce results and in this story, death and loneliness were the results produced.If you are a man that isn't gay, I can understand how boring it would be.  But if you have ever done anything that you thought could produce your death were it to be known and the combination of angst and anxiety that it brings despite the joy Ennis and Jack shared, then this movie does it well.I thought Heath Ledger deserved an Oscar for his performance because he brought so much depth to the role.  And for these two straight guys to feign this passion so realistically really shows how great they are as actors.There were too many technical mistakes in the movie to rate 5 stars and I thought Jack's ""first time"" went awfully smoothly so a little downgrade for lack of realism.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"Gay cowboy movie or not, you will not be able to shake the pull of ""Brokeback Mountain"" once its' through.  The acting is too strong, the writing is too perceptive, the direction is too smart and the cinematography is too spare and beautiful to just flow away into indifference.  Director Ang Lee pulls off one hell of a love story that transcends sexuality.  It's about two people who truly fall in love.  One summer Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet in the Wyoming Mountains to herd sheep, a job both expect little out of.  What they don't anticipate is that both share deep commanalities, such as broken homes and dreams of a better life.  What they really don't expect is too fall for each other.  Both leave the mountain, and eventually continue on with their lives the way society has told them to.  Ennis marries his sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack marries a rodeo chick (Anne Hathaway), but neither of them finds the happiness that they felt with each other that special, innocent summer.  Jack eventually finds the bravery to push for what he wants, but Ennis, closed-off and emotionally inexperienced (Ledger gives a performance of epic emotional intensity), can't bring himself to acknowledge what he knows, whether it is love for Jack or his paternal need to be with his daughters.  And he learns too late what it is he really wants.Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are emotional knockouts and the actors who beat them for the Oscars had better have given superhuman efforts to best them.  You don't find two performances like these just anywhere.  The same goes for Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, who hit grace notes that almost any other actor would have overlooked.  Credit director Ang Lee for obsessively scanning the small things that make a good actor great, and a good movie a classic.  A movie about gay cowboys it may be, but it's the humanity and love between Ennis and Jack that make ""Brokeback Mountain"" universal.  You won't be able to forget it."	5.0	"""Brokeback Mountain"" is Unforgettable"	2006-03-13	48	42	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2Q836HGN6YX60	"M. L. Mitchell ""marikelm"""	"If like myself, you heard all of the hoopla and jokes pointed at this movie, (not the least of which, was the line from Jack to Ennis, ""I wish I knew how to quit you"") avoiding seeing it might have seemed like a good decision.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is not the ""Gay Cowboy"" movie, but a devastatingly beautiful story about love between two men.  The intimate scenes are tastefully filmed and poignant.  For ranch hand Ennis Delmar, being gay is beyond his scope of understanding in 1963 Wyoming.  While he and the only slightly more aware, Jack Twist find themselves herding sheep together for a summer job in Wyoming, the truly unexpected happens.  They become friends and suddenly much more.  While both men go on to try and live the conventional married with children lifestyle with women, meeting up with each other again four years later only proves to each other that theirs, is the real love.  For nearly twenty years they meet a few times a year in the safe confines of Brokeback Mountain.  The marriages of both men deteriorate under the strain of an all consuming love that has to be kept a secret from the world, at least as far as Ennis is concerned.  The viewer is made painfully aware of the suffering due to separation and longing, of lifelong love and passion.  All of this is done with stellar performances by Ledger and Gyllenhall, who can say more with a look than any words might convey.  Ang Lee directs with a sensitive but no holds barred approach.  The cinematography is so good as to give this movie an epic feel.  The windy, Wyoming plains pound home the feelings of loneliness and desolation this movie evokes. The bottom line is, love is love.  One walks away from this movie profoundly moved.  An interesting little twist near the end shows Ennis viewing the contents of Jack's closet.  This is when love and heartbreak transcends any type of sexual orientation to become the language we all know and speak.  A must see movie, maybe twice!"	5.0	Love is Love	2006-08-31	32	29	3

Martinez ""movie lover"""	"This movie is haunting and stays with you because of the sheer waste of it all when you follow your head instead of your heart.Ennis is a closed up person Jack is fun and outgoing.They take a job together herding sheep and before the summer is over they fall in love.Jack wants them to have a life together, Ennis doesn't because then he would have to admit that he is head over heels in love with another man and is scare that this relationship will be the death of them if anyone found out.So every year they steal a few days here and there at Brokeback mountain.So Ennis's fears cheats them out of a life together and after 20 years all he has to show for it is a shirt,a postcard, and alot of bittersweet memories of ""what if"". This to me is not groundbreaking.If you want to see grounbreaking try the movie MAURICE which was made in 1987 and is set in pre-war world I in England.Maurice is coming to terms with his sexual preference and the feelings he has for his best friend  in a place were if you are caught it was punishable with imprisoment.He then meets Alec Scudder,a servant in his friends household and they start a relationship.They meet one last time because Alec is leaving the country for a better job position.Maurice asks him to stay that finding each other was a one in a thousand shot,that they should go away together.Alec's response was ""Are you daft,it would never work Maurice,it would be the ruin of both of us.Well guess what, Alec does miss his ship and they meet at the boathouse before they go away together.That to me is groundbreaking!Yes, the Brokeback mountain is set in cowboy country in 1963. But people ,it is 1963,not the middle ages. There will always be someone who hates you or doesn't want  anything to do with you because of the color of your skin,religion,social status,or sexual preference. If you let your fears stop you from living life in a way that makes you happy you are fool and deserve whatever you get.What irritates me about Ennis was that he wanted to have his cake and eat it too.A ""straight "" life with a wife and children and  Jack on the side whenever he could spare the time. He learned too late that !!IT""S NOT THE QUANTITY OF TIME BUT THE QUALITY OF TIME THAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING!!Don't get me wrong it is a beatiful movie with beatiful scenery and wonderful acting from the entire cast .I did give it 4 out of 5 starts.But to me it would of been groundbraking if Ennis had given their relationship a real chance.The truth of it was Jack was a risktaker and took chances and Ennis never did and never wanted to.To me this wan't about being gay in 1963 but about a person inability to accept himself and go after what he wanted in life because of what other people might say or do."	4.0	Haunting movie, but not groundbraking	2006-01-20	12	2	10
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2XSILKF8IFN6M	M.Miller	"First of all, can I just say, ""MY GOD"" I haven't seen such a brilliantly made movie since ""MILLION DOLLAR BABY"", even though I do think Brokeback Mountain does surpass Million Dollar Baby, with regards to better acting and just an all around, a better movie. Even though Clint Eastwood is ""THE MAN""! The title of my review expresses exactly how I was feeling when I left the theater.This is the tragic love story of two cowboys who fall in love while in the mountains of Brokeback. With the first love scene, it comes of as an unreasoning or an extravagant passion or attraction, which can be defined as INFATUATION. In the movie, we later on realize that, it's not infatuation at all, but something that goes much deeper. Something many of us don't like to say unless we truly meant it, something we call.... LOVE. Regardless of the fact that it is a love between two men, we as humans should understand because love is a universal emotion which everyone, straight or not, can understand and feel. Brokeback Mountain depicts every emotion we as humans feel; Love...sadness...fear...and anger.I was blown away by the performances of all the cast members including Anne Hathaway, which many people basically forgot was in the movie. Even though I do agree with her not being nominated for an Oscar because her performance was the weakest. Honestly, as hard as it is to say, because Jake Gyllenhaal is my favorite actor EVER and probably one of the most underrated,(Even though people are starting to catch on to him now) although he's been great since DONNIE DARKO. Heath Ledger's performance was stronger and more powerful than Jake's. I feel as though if anyone should've won an Oscar, he should.(Damn u, Capote!). His performance was one of the best performances to ever not win an Oscar in the history of the academy awards. Although these are strong words, they are true. I have never seen Heath act with so much heart and, passion and take on a character who isn't even an embody that fictional character like he did in Brokeback Mountain. Unlike the other actors who were nominated, who had someone who they could mirror and were trying to portray which, is still great. But to become someone who doesn't even exist with such passion and raw talent it would've seemed as though there were really an Ennis del Mar!Now on to Jake and Michelle. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was incredible as Jack Twist in Brokeback Mountain. But everyone should remember that, just because your not crying in every scene, fighting a cause, or even screaming at people in a dramatic and emotional way, doesn't mean you can't create a powerful performance. Which is exactly what Jake did, he was subtle with a lot of his expressions and feelings, and wasn't aggressive in several scenes. For the main part, Jake was very subtle, to portray a character that was in love with another man, not by choice.Best said in this line,""I anit no queer,"" said Ennis, Jack replies,""me neither."" His facial expressions and body language are priceless in the film, and those are attributes which not everyone possess. During these times an actor's real talent is shown, because its not always about how dramatic you can be.Michelle Williams performance is heartbreaking to watch. She, like Heath, really did a '180'(degree)in terms of the fact that I wasn't really a huge fan of their acting, and they've just done wonders in this film. We get to see her go through the horrible experience of her having to come to terms with the fact that her husband is having an affair, and to make matters worse, with the possibility that he could be gay; with his affair having to be with another man. Also, how every time he goes away to fish with his friend, they are together in more than one way. Michelle's breakdown in the movie was nothing short of incredible and moving. She may not have won the Oscar, but she surely deserved it. But I guess that it all depends on the opinion of the viewers/critics. And finally Ang Lee; Wow. No words can describe how thankful I am to him for making this movie and having the courage to carry on even with all the obstacles he had to face trying to make the movie. Thank you for your genius idea because this movie could've easily been a disaster. Even though Brokeback was snubbed for best picture, they had to give it to you Ang because your directing was nothing short of brilliant.... Thank You with the dearest of appreciation.Going to the movie, I was just expecting a great movie. But now thinking back, this was more than just a great movie. It was one of a kind, and probably will remain that way. I felt, basically, every emotion that Heath , Jake , Michelle , and even Anne felt. This may be a movie about tragedies, but the biggest tragedy was the Oscars showing there true colors; giving the best picture award to a movie that in its own right, was incredible but nowhere near on the same level, and as brilliantly made as Brokeback Mountain. This movie tears at your heart for 2 hrs and 15 mins, and with the way I, and probably many others, felt for many days to come."	5.0	Left with the deepest Sadness....	2006-03-30	15	12	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1FSHWEMU190DX	mmmtea	"The film received Golden Globes for best director, screenplay, and drama film (just to name a few of many awards recieved in other conventions). It is no wonder Ang Lee's adaptation of E. Annie Proulx's story Brokeback Mountain is a triumph and a beautiful one at that.This movie could have very well been a mess, but with the dedicated musicians, producers, director, writers, and especially actors, it left me speechless. Both Jake Gyllenhaal (as Jack Twist) and Heath Ledger (as Ennis Del Mar) in my opinion were spectacular. Two hetrogenically separate characters, that ironically mixes with such grace and beauty. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also presented an amazing roll as the two guys' wives. It touched on such a sensitive and controversial story about the loneliness of homosexuality in society of Wyoming, 1963. But fundamentally, it was more than a gay cowboy film; it was an extremely passionate story about love in which everyone who has been in can relate to, and learn so much for from it. It's an extremely beautiful and poignant film with stunning cinematography that captures the audience in a deep, deep place within. I'm still speechless to this day. I'm utterly, utterly speechless.The beautiful score by Argentina-born, California-based Gustavo Santaolalla sent shivers down my spine. He provided the film with a true breathtaking western score of crisp and melancholy sounds from violins, banjos, acoustic guitars and other westerly influenced instruments. I literally choke up if I ever listen to the soundtrack, that's when you know there is something special in the music that follows the story. The soundtrack also includes heartfelt music by Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, Teddy Thompson, Mary McBride, Rufus Wainwright (who appeared on Antony and the Johnson's stunning album, ""I Am a Bird Now"") and many others.People say it's slow, but I disagree. I think it's honest and true. I hate drama films that have this relationship with two people meeting on streets cutting to them dating all of a sudden cutting to them getting married. I mean, what's the point of that. I could just easily watch TV (which I don't). The best parts are in between and are always missed out. This movie shows and captures a love relationship that hides nothing, and I have total respect for that. The story, the acting was all so solid. Thus, potentially making it my favourite film of the 20 years I've been on this earth. Honest to god, it was that good. I have never ever been so moved in my entire life.I'm also amazed how far we have come from having this sort of film leaked into the mainstream - and for the first time of my life time. All I can say is ""wow"". Even though I don't agree that we're all compromising and accepting, it is very gutsy and brave of Ang Lee to bring this to the big screen; a start of something revolutionary in cinemas. The most touching part about this film is that even though it's a period film, it is still relatable and put into context gay or straight.What a incredible multilayered story with such a superb crew. Its truthful perception of a same-sex relationship has generated admiration and controversy. Brokeback Mountain truly proves to be an epic, and should never be forgotten; not only as a great gay story, but as a tragic and heartbreaking love tale between two lovers that couldn't be.

This is the kind of film where, if you blink, you might break the spell. In my opinion, it was created for the big screen, theater-like type of viewing.So many people said we should forget about the ""gay cowboy"" aspect. Indeed. Although being about two gay men, this film is definitely not only for gay people. As any great film should be considered.Art film lovers would probably have oodles to discuss about ""Brokeback Mountain"". Delicate, subtle, beautiful, poignant, cerebral, devastating and haunting, this film is a work of art. It achieves what a great work of art does: gets one thinking, elicits powerful emotions and heavy controversy. Annie Proulx's novella was translated into a superb screenplay that remains faithful to the story and keeps the spirit of its characters alive. Besides the astonishing performances of both Mr. Ledger and Mr. Gyllenhaal (and the rest of the acting cast, no less), what makes this movie many cuts above a mere tearjerker is the masterful direction. It seems like Ang Lee has not wasted any image, any second of this movie. Watch the camera work (great cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto), the subtle and symbolic use of detail and colors, the beautiful composition of so many images  and the precise positioning of the characters in certain scenes, all doen in order to tell the viewer so much more than what is said by dialogue. The love scenes, oh, here we go: quietly expressive, powerful, intimate, sensual yet not graphic. There's a sense of privacy and emotional restraint about Ang Lee's direction that make these scenes so affecting.Then there is the music, delicate, almost scarce, complementing the movie instead of overpowering it, and beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Never has a guitar sounded so evocative like Gustavo Santaolalla's.I believe it takes several viewings to be able to take this film in and fully appreciate it. This movie is so delicately expressive on so many levels that it permeates us, first emotionally, then on a more cerebral level. There are so many metaphors and symbols that abund and enrich it, making it a fulfilling experience, albeit quite devastating - the more we understand the beauty of this film, the deeper it cuts...A word of warning, though. This is a film that does not do the thinking, feeling or judging for us. Most of all, it doesn't trivialize itself by making a statement, offering easy closure or redemption, answering questins - all things that would turn it into just another movie, not the timeless work of art it is. When watching it, we are on our own, at the mercy of our own mentality, sensibilities, perceptions, biases. It's a film that we don't view, we live, and it stays unyieldingly and unapologetically true to life until the end."	5.0	Film art at its finest	2006-01-13	11	8	3

Opinion and diversity makes the world what it is and Brokeback Mountain shows us another part of the world that many people still, unfortunately, want kept in the closet.Annie Proulx's purpose was to expose homophobia in that time and place. Heath Ledger did an excellent job of internalizing his character's homophobia. Only those who have been there can truly appreciate the depth presented here.Homophobia destroys not only the person who is homophobic but all those around them, family, friends, and as so brilliantly and vividly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, their lovers too.This movie gained wider appeal also due to its message of unrequited love. Anyone who has ever experienced lost opportunity for love can identify. An emotionally powerful film.Highly recommended!However, I docked 1 star due to Ang Lee's lame attempt to make this beautiful film more acceptable to a wider audience by cutting out the male nudity that made the film distracting and feel less natural than the short story.Even after that, there was high political motivation for the film's R rating. This fine film should have been rated no higher than PG or PG-13 at most. It's R-rating is a pure political rating with absolutely no basis in fact from the CARA's own rules for ratings.Jake Gyllenhaal did a much better job for an actor in a supporting role than did George Clooney in Syriana. Another AMPAS snuff at a politically controversial film.Those who say that the lack of a Best Film Oscar or Best Supporting Actor Oscar were not due to Hollywood's well-known homophobia are naive or just plain stupid. Well known actors have been in the closet since the birth of Hollywood and continue to influence its peer voting to this very day.I cannot recommend the Special Edition released on Jan 23. It appears to be a case of ""double-dipping"" by the production company as there is little, if anything, new on this version. However, also released is the HD version that, for die-hard Brokie fans, will be a pleasure hearing the enhanced HD sound as well as the stunning photography.Regardless of how you feel about the topic, you should not cheat yourself from seeing one of the last great performances of Heath Ledger."	4.0	Don't cheat yourself by missing this great film.	2008-11-26	6	3	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A320HPR5VOS2W1	movie addict	"As a straight male, I was embarrassed to tell my friends that I watched Brokeback Mountain about a week ago. Next thing you know, one of my closest guy friends comes up to me and asks me if I had ever seen it. Without hesitation, I replied: ""Yes, and it is one of the greatest romantic movies I have ever seen."" His response to that was basically saying the same thing.I'm sure by this point, 8 years after the film's release, the vast majority of you know the story so I'll just cut to the review.During the course of watching this movie, I sat completely still. The only movement was the blinking of my eyes. At some points, I grew so intrigued that I forgot how to breathe. Sitting through the forbidden romance was heartbreaking and painful. After the movie was over, I couldn't even reach 2 feet over to grab the remote. I just sat on the couch hypnotically watching the credits scroll with a blank stare. After managing to turn off the TV, I went up to my bedroom and sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the wall. A moment later, a wave of sadness swept over me like a blanket. I was stunned. The acting is terrific (R.I.P. Heath Ledger), the atmosphere is almost as depressing as the movie itself, and the soundtrack definitely has a few perks to it. However, the ending was somewhat expected (all great romances end in tragedy) and in some ways, a little dull. Brokeback Mountain is one of the movies you can watch once, but always remember. A key element that I feel is excessively upsetting is that neither Ennis (Heath Ledger) or Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) ever admit their true orientation to anyone else in the story and deny the fact that they are gay or possibly bi. I am a huge fan of the movies that bring out the emotions which are buried deep within, and this movie gets an A+ in that perspective. Hollywood has done the LGBT community a great favor with this one. Ever since I first watched it last week, I have shown it to quite a few people who also ended up loving it! Overall, Brokeback Mountain is a classic that should not be missed by anyone!!!"	5.0	I am speechless...	2013-08-27	10	10	0
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3369ZM9UHB89Z	"Moviebuff ""Layne"""	I rarely watch the Oscars because the show is too drawn out.  I made an effort to see it last night because I wanted to see history being made with Brokeback winning best film.  Needless to say, I was totally disgusted.It's not so much that Brokeback lost, than it is for the obvious reason it lost.  It lost due to prejudice.Everyone knows that prior to the Oscars, Brokeback won every best picture award available, except one.  Just one.  There must have been upwards of a dozen wins.  If Crash was as good a film, or better, wouldn't one expect that IT would have won some of those awards along the way?  It won only ONE...Add to that bit of reasoning the reports that many of the academy voters didn't even want to see the film due to the content.  Well, even if they did eventually see it, that stated desire to not see it defines a prejudice that would prevent them from voting for it no matter how good it was.To me it's incredible that they would even voice such an opinon.I don't care that Brokeback Mountain lost if people really felt another film was better.  I care that, based on all the awards won, Brokeback was obviously the better film, and lost because of personal prejudices.Any voter who voices a desire to NOT review any film nominated for Best Picture should be dismissed.  They have no business being a voter on the academy if they can't watch the films nominated, even a gay themed film.  Voicing their desire to not even see the film was shameful.I lost a lot of respect for the Academy.  I doubt very much I'll want to watch the show again.  There just comes a time when enough is enough.  It's bad enough that we have to face all the prejudices we do in this country without having the Academy boast on one hand about making and supporting movies that advance social justice and equality, while then passing up the opportunity to choose the best film that is doing just that - all because of their own prejudices.Today, homophobia is a far greater societal evil than racism.  Only radical fringe groups such as the Aryans and the KKK would do harm to racial minorities... and they are not supported by mainstream America at all...  But mainstream America - the church going hypocrites they are (mostly), still think it's perfectly okay to be as nasty and cruel to us as they can be (be it personal or societal).  And they justify their actions by the same Bible that promotes slavery, and the subjugation of women.  As I said.. Hypocrites.The academy had a chance to pick the best film, and send a very needed message.  The film will do wonders anyhow, and as time goes on, Brokeback will be the one film remembered most for 2005...For those of us who love the beauty of this film, at least we'll always have that..	5.0	Prejudice, Pure and Simple	2006-03-06	87	73	14

Part of the reason is their tendency to judge something by its cover rather than what it truly is. So many people focus their attention on action movies that they never stop to appreciate the beauty of the plot.Brokeback Mountain has set a new standard to the film industry.

Based on a story by a great author, great actors, a renowned director and great reviews should equal a great movie experience, but I'm conflicted.  My biggest complaint about the movie is the relationship between the two main characters- to me if feels like it comes out of left field.  I have no sense for why these two men fall in love and spend the next 20 years meeting up, outside of the physical aspect of their relationship.  What is it that they see in each other, other than the fact that they are gay men living closeted lives?  I feel much more sympathetic towards Ennis' wife.  When she finds out about the relationship, it is heartbreaking.  Watching Michelle Williams play her suffering through this reality for years is the true great performance in this movie.  In the end, I felt Jack's love for Ennis more than the other way around.  Even the final scene does nothing to convince me of the magnitude Ennis' loss.  Despite my reservations over the authenticity of the love story, the movie is beautiful and there are great performances from the actors.

I cannot blame these people, Brokeback Mountain is a film so moving that left me in a new level of cinematic experience.

With Brokeback Mountain, the meaning reverts to the root word ""move.""

If I have one criticism, it would be its lack of background in terms of providing insight into Jack Twist's life prior to his meeting Ennis Del Mar.  It also did not fully define why Ennis' wife did not confront him with her knowledge of his secret prior to their getting divorced, and also did not fully explore Jack's strange and distant relationship with his wife either.  However, already being two and one-half hours long, perhaps it just was not possible to fill in those holes and still retain a coherent film in the process.  Yes, Heath Ledger's Ennis was deep and believable, but Jake Gyllenhal was magnificent as Jack Twist who was brave enough to want to follow his heart and say hell and be damned to the whole world.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1O42HTIVMHVD9	Movie Man	"Saw this six times in the theater and have seen it twice on DVD.  Obsessive?  Perhaps, but the repeated viewings speak to the power of the film.  I have never before been so mesmerized by a movie.  For me, ""Brokeback"" touched on painful experiences, memories and fears in a way that no other art-work ever has.  Like other positive reviewers, I can only offer thanks to Ang Lee, the producers, and the cast.On the big screen, I can't find any flaw with the film. Strengths include the obvious majesty of the landscapes and the cinematography that capture it. The characters are entirely credible and are given exquisite nuances by both the script and the actors. For better or for worse, I recognize and have experienced some of the conflicts and situations depicted in the film and have been overwhelmed by the emotional accuracy that the ensemble has been able to depict.  Two days after the first viewing, I had to shut the office door as I involuntarily burst into tears.  ""Brokeback"" had broken down my own walls of constraint and self-serving amnesia.I have heard criticisms that there is not enough ""passion"" depicted between the two male leads, and that some viewers don't believe that the two were in love.  Some have even said that the early parts of the film, where our two leads get to know each other, are slow or even boring.  Most, if not all, of the people that I have heard saying this have been straight males.  They are entitled to their opinion, but I suspect that their view is colored by the fact that they have never fallen in love with a male. Anyone who has--a female, a gay male, or even a straight male who has experienced a crush on a buddy--can feel the admiration and deep love that is communicated between the two leads, both in their silence and in the consummately ""male"" banter.  Whereas some may sit and wonder why in the early film we see so much time spent on Brokeback Mountain, I suspect that anyone who has fallen for a male understands the why all too well.  The early film brilliantly and efficiently captures the shift between Ennis and Jack from indifference, to trust, to ""the love the dared not express its name."" This dynamic is different from what might transpire between a male and a female, precisely because the very possibility of the transformation was unanticipated (at least by Ennis);  whereas any interaction between a male and female has an implicit possibility for romance or sex, what we witness in the early film is the emergence of something that had heartofore not been imagined (again, at least in the case of Ennis.  Jack's situation is a bit more ambiguous).  Mapping that transformation is what the early film was about, and Lee did so brilliantly.  We see the characters making furtive glances at each other.  We witness the break-through when Ennis speaks ""more than he has in the last year.""  We see the consummation of the relationship, and the anger, confusion, and even hate that result from it.  It's the dynamic of becoming aware of unknown feelings, a dynamic that is even different from what might transpire  between two open, more emotionally demonstrative gay males.  But the love, sometimes exhilerating, sometimes crushing, was palpable and brilliantly portrayed.  It is the very maleness in the leads' taciturn expression and activities that the two admired in each other and which, for some viewers, makes the leads so attractive.The rest of the film is right on target.  The leads' subterfuge that does not fool family members, the pain felt by the wronged wives and girlfriend, the struggle for both characters to find the love that they need in a world that forbids them it, and at the end, the devastating feeling of having missed a major opportunity in life---all of this is well done.On a small screen, the DVD fails to capture the grandness of the early part of the film, and in this failure there is a consequent loss of cinematographic poetry.  I suspect that viewers with ultra-sophisticated TV equipment will get far more out of the DVD than people using dinosaur equipment.I am not one prone to drammatic statements and emotional pronouncements.  Against this disclaimer, I will add that this movie has deeply affected me.  Through it, I have been able to talk about issues that I never before have raised with many straight friends.  More importantly, many straight friends have broached topics and concerns with me that they never before ever gave thought to.  Many gay friends who are more comfortable in their sexuality than I am have, too.  Both sets of friends have shown a newfound understanding of the painful conflicts that some, but not all, gay men suffer.  By themselves, these more open communication and understanding make the film a godsend.  The artistry of all involved take the film to another level.  It is a true treasure."	5.0	A treasure.	2006-04-19	49	39	10

Williams	"This movie began looking like a well made piece of cinema, excellent soundtrack, beautiful scenery, fine acting, especially the opening piece with Randy Quaid, no comedy in this part but played convincingly well.  Then all of a sudden, the ""shocker"", okay they're gay (even though laughingly enough you do get to hear the line ""I ain't no queer"").I wouldn't think it was necessary to validate ones own opinion of this film based on the subject matter.  I have no problem with homosexuality, although I've seen movies that are 10 times better that deal with the subject.  This movie simply had no depth of characters.  I followed the slow but all too ""choppy"" time line of events but none of the scenes seemed to validate the the story, each scene was so short that nothing seemed to have much believabilty, just bits of story line thrown in to represent the passing of time, not the best of writing, so I guess I disagree with all the ""knowledgable reviewers"".I expected a great deal more from this film and I'm really sorry it didn't deliver.  The acting was very good, I just didn't see any real charisma going on between the two main characters and everyone else just seemed to be thrown into the mix at will.In order for a screen play to have validity I need to see characters that have some sort of depth.  Heath Ledgers daughters grow up during this film but you only see brief glimpses of them as time passes, one day he meets one in a diner, the scene lasts all of about two minutes, next she istelling him she is getting married, all of another 2 minute scene.  We're left to wonder if the other daughter stopped exsisting or was forgotten by the script master or what, but most reviewers won't mention that, they're too busy praising the filmakers for taking on such a controversial subject.Parts of this film reminded me of a ""made for TV"" movie depicting the life story of some forgotten celebrity.  Most of the story line just seems to be ""tossed in"" to show the passing of time, very sloppy writing in my opinion, although a fine screen play may have saved this story.Even between the 2 main characters the story line is weak.  Their ""romantic"" scenes seem totally out of character.  Perhaps this is to envoke a feeling of shock in the viewers but it only added to the lack of depth.  Maybe this is ""Cowboy love"" but it just seems odd to me that these two rough and tough cowboys that barely talk to one another are immediately caught up in an uncontrollable passion, am I the only one that finds this hard to swallow.After viewing a film and determining its value I take into consideration 2 basic things, ""Would I see it again?"" no, ""What was memorable about it?"" nothing."	3.0	Completely dissapointed, mostly in the writing	2006-02-17	49	13	36

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A39JKNW3FY2487	Mrs Darley	"It looks to me as if some very bitter people are posting reviews here. I'm not talking about the occasional person who dares to find fault with the movie, either! I mean some reviews of the less complimentary reviews are pretty personal and somewhat unbalanced, in certain cases. Dare I say that I myself also found it ""not bad""? It could have been better... (I can already hear Heath Ledger style voices grumbling ""That thar's faghtn' tawk, stroinger!!"")""Not bad"" is a reasonable assessment as far as I'm concerned. But I can already hear the howls of indignation from those to whom this film is clearly something of a sacred cause. I just hope more balanced readers and film-lovers will be able to differentiate between honest, fair criticism and what looks to me like campaigning, the kind of thoughtless hissy fit that belongs on the soap-box rather than in a film-review. I'm willing to bet that a lot of the film's virulent defenders are talking more about their private convictions, more about the issue than the film. That mind-set makes for poor judgement. And mediocre film-making, come to think of it.Assessed purely as a film, Brokeback Mountain is quite good. Lovely photography, atmospheric in places. The acting is good but not great. A bit uncomfortable in terms of audibility from Ledger and lack of gravitas from Gyllenhaal. The morality of ""tough guys"" subjected to romantic longing and unrequited love is touching. The ethics of the way these two subsequently treat their families is seedier.All adds up to nothing as special as you'd think from the ululations of its apologists. And this is the crux of the problem: expectations set too high, at least for the even-handed viewer. When we compare the film to its reputation amongst certain hysterics, as we can hardly avoid doing, then the movie falls probably flatter than it deserves.Apart from the Big Issue, which is not dealt with in Brokeback Mountain as well as it is treated in Desert Hearts, for just one example, Ang Lee clearly inhabits some kind of Praise Only Zone. What we might call the ""orthodoxy"" of received fan ""wisdom"" is a barrier to fair judgement. This is also the case with Ledger, a good actor who is indulged in mumbling and so inhibited (presumably by the director) from delivering his best performance. Although you wouldn't think it from some of the ravings here.The other lead is undeniably pretty, if that's what unholsters your pistol. But those who shout here about his ""talent"" protest a bit too much, methinks. It all reminds me of screaming teenagers who think the pop-children on their bedroom wall posters are great musicians. And just because something is relentlessly depressing doesn't necessarily make it profound as tragedy. Quality and discipline are required for that to happen. This film lacks in both areas.If this film fills a hole in some people's lives, if it's just what they were looking for, mainstream cinema coming to the rescue of what they've seen as some neglected special-interest area of their own, well, that's fine. But don't tout your ""opinions of the film"" as anything more than wish-fulfilment, in that case. Those squealing here about the ""integrity"" of others are pretty lacking in that quality themselves, as far as I can see. Get real: it's not a bad film. But neither is it anywhere near as good as it's cracked up to be. My best advice to the film's truculent defenders would be to shut up and let sensible people make up their own minds; otherwise you're going to do more damage to your precious movie than it probably deserves. In brief: a film in danger of being spoilt more by its bitchier fans than by its own minor flaws."	3.0	Head for the Hills! the Brokeback Fan-Posse's in Town!	2006-05-15	47	21	26

There, they become friends - and, later on, lovers, even though both insist that they are not ""queer"" (gay). When their jobs come to an end, they go their separate ways, but neither are totally happy until, four year later, they meet up. Over the next 20 years, they meet up (once or twice a year). I won't give away any more...........This movie has been referred to as a ""gay cowboy movie"", but, after watching it, I feel that it is SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT!!

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ARBGQSABX0823	mwk06	"""Brokeback Mountain"" is not a movie that offers scenes after scenes of exciting action or those lame, comic situations to give instant gratification. It is made not to entertain, but because it is ""a story that has to be told"". It doesn't line up with the usual box office hits, so I'm quite surprised that it has been as well received by the general public apart from the film critics. To do Ang Lee's films justice, one needs to sit back and remain focused on the screen. It requires more work and patience than most movies.Following the typical Ang Lee approach, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is an extended film that begins with a languid pace, tracking the relationship between Ennis and Jack that spans twenty years. It refrains from hammering a message into the viewers' head, but allows the story to unfold and speak for itself. Silently, the film reaches out and seeps under your skin, and before you know it, ""Brokeback Mountain"" has found the rawest part of your heart and pierce right through it.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a heartbreaking love story made more tragic by the extra dimension of homosexuality. While other star-crossed lovers like Romeo and Juliet have to struggle with external pressures of filial loyalties and social boundaries, Ennis has been taught to hate the very core of his own identity. His self-loath has petrified his ability to love. His self-deceiving denial of his true feelings causes him to lash out in bouts of violence. Gradually, Ennis alienates the people who care for him and pushes himself towards the edge.More tragically, there is a chance that Ennis and Jack could've spend their lives together in happiness, although it would mean severing their ties with the world. But Ennis is too afraid of society and of himself to seize it. Only when he has lost Jack does Ennis realize how much their relationship means to him, and that he would've risked it all to build a life with Jack. But by that time, it is too late.Most of us can recall those ineffaceable regrets we now have from choosing the easier path, the ""what ifs"" that come back to haunt us during a sleepless night.But Brokeback Mountain also offers hope and redemption in the finals scenes. The now-famous blood-stained shirts worked together as one is a powerful symbol of their love that cannot be denied. Jack's mother, who invites Ennis to visit Jack's room and discover the shirts, shows that she has known about their relationship and chooses to accept them despite the hateful hostility of her husband.Finally, we witness the evolution of Ennis, who is empowered to slowly reach out to those who love him. Though he initially tries to bail out of his daughter's wedding, he steers himself in the opposite direction and accepts her invitation even if he has to quit his job. The very last moments of the film, which I'll not reveal here, is simply genius.I encourage viewers to see the movie at least twice. One can better appreciate the many nuances and acting after you know how the story develops. For those who are willing to open themselves to ""Brokeback Mountain"", it will tell you a beautiful love story that lingers with you as you leave the cinema. Perhaps it will inspire you to reconnect with your own heart and soul and become better people."	5.0	Reconnecting with your heart	2006-03-08	81	74	7

I watched it with an open mind and found it to be a beautifully filmed, heart wrenching film.  Most already know the gist of it so I won't dwell on it (I won't mention how it ends) but it is about a rodeo rider and a ranch hand (Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar) who get hired to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain in 1963.  They begin a relationship there which, at first, appears violent but, in the next love scene, looks very tender.Twist (played by the very handsome Jake Gyllenhaal) wants to start a life with his new friend but the reticent Del Mar (he mumbles as if he has marbles in his mouth--actually he reminds me a little of Boomhower from King of the Hill in terms of sometimes not being able to understand what he is saying)) does not believe it will ever work due to a horrible sight he had as a kid of the corpse of a man who was in a homosexual relationship beaten and dragged to death by a hate-filled gang which included, perhaps, Del Mar's father.  Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) had plans to marry and both men do marry and have families of their own but are never really happy.  Twist is married to a cold woman and is despised by his father-in-law.  Del Mar's wife witnessed her husband and Twist kissing which created an unspoken resentment that led to the marriage failing.  The only happiness the men have is the occasional times they return to their hidden companionship and love life on Brokeback Mountain.  Even these good times are hampered by the fact that they must return to their lonely lives in the outside world.I think there was a lot more tenderness between the men that could have been shown.  So much of their time together includes harsh words and physical violence.  Such love is revealed when Twist admits to his friend, ""The truth is, sometimes I miss you so much I can hardly stand it.""  Another review used the word ""understated,"" and I think that is an excellent description of the film.  However understated it is, it had me crying at the end.The scenery of Brokeback Mountain is beautiful and the film does an excellent job aging the characters as the film progresses through 20 years.  It is 2 hours and 15 minutes and, though it is not particularly fast-moving, it is interesting enough to hold one's attention throughout.  The extras (i.e. ""The Making of.."") are very well-done although there is a lot of the predictable praising between actors.  I don't know if it is the type of film I could watch numerous times, but it does make me want to read the short story which inspired it."	5.0	"""So, what we got now is Brokeback Mountain, everything's built on that, that's all we got!""---Jack Twist"	2008-01-19	24	21	3

True, director Ang Lee won the coveted ""Best Director"" award that year that EVERYONE predicted he would win.  Even Spielberg, who was also nominated that year for ""Munich"", could only say: ""Too Good"".  But the biggest shocker was ""Brokeback"" losing the ""Best Picture"" Oscar that year to the underwhelming ""Crash"".  Could it have been H-Wood's way of a ""Brokeback Backlash""?  Very well could have been.Once in a while the Motion Picture Academy in Hollywood REALLY gets very self-important and high on its ARSE and blows it!  2006 was one of those years and instead awards the ""Best Picture"" to CRASH.  In terms of the story packing an emotional punch, ""Brokeback"" is right up there with ""Million Dollar Baby"" in giving the audience an unforgettable movie-going experience, especially as the film marches to its shattering conclusion.  As expected, ""Million Dollar"" won Best Picture Oscar the previous year for director/producer Clint Eastwood.  And then to have Hollywood award ""Best Picture"" to Martin Scorsese the following year for ""The Departed"", well, everybody knew that was a token for making up to the man for snubbing ""Raging Bull"" 25 years earlier.  I don't know if Ang Lee will ever get a second chance to win ""Best Picture Oscar"" that Hollywood has accorded Martin Scorsese, who has been nominated for several years running.  The are folks in the Asian community who speculate  Ang Lee (who is Chinese from Taiwan) was perhaps the victim of ""Racism"" in Hollywood.  That might hold true to some level, but when it comes to matters like ""Racism"" these speculaton cannot be substantiated or proven.Movie critic Roger Ebert predicted in the final weeks of Oscar voting that ""Crash"" would win ""Best Picture"" based on his observations and conversations with members of the motion picture  academy.  He comes out to say ""Brokeback"" was suffering from a backlash of sorts in Hollywood.  To say it was Homophobia is a joke considering how many gays work in the film and entertainment industry.  What led to ""Brokeback's"" downfall during the final weeks of Academy voting?  We'll never know, but to say ""Crash"" is a superior film compared to ""Brokeback"" really perplexes me.  Once in a while Hollywood really gets it right and awards the best films and actors with a deserving Oscar.  But many times Hollywood really misses the mark, and sadly for ""Brokeback"" fans, 2006 was one of those years in giving the coveted ""Best Picture Oscar"" to the much-less deserving ""Crash"".  I'm sure Ang Lee has lost sleep many a nights wondering why he won all the major awards leading up to the Oscars and then to lose the BIG ONE on the biggest night in Hollywood.  That's a bitter pill to swallow."	5.0	"Ang Lee's MASTERPIECE, But Sadly Ang Is Robbed Of ""Best Picture"" Oscar"	2010-07-18	10	10	0
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3LM3Y84YMOPQW	"Naomsters ""Naomsters"""	When I first saw Brokeback with my two best friends, I was about fourteen years old. All three of us appreciated it and were torn by the ending, (especially my friend who spent most of the movie gushing over Jake Gyllenhaal) but I didn't give it a whole lot of thought until a few months ago when I realized how powerful a film it really is. I borrowed it from my friend and watched it and it instantly re-captivated me.I watched it about three times in one week, noticing new symbolism and meaning each time in the phrases and actions of the characters. I noticed that the looks Jack and Ennis give one another when they first begin herding together are more than just obligatory. After reading Roger Ebert's helpful and honest review, I realized that Ennis really was taught to hate himself from an early age because of his upbringing. Some Japanese amazon reviews taught me to see that, when Ennis first finds his and Jack's shirts, Jack's is embracing Ennis', whereas at the end of the film, Ennis has his own shirt embracing Jack's. One thing I noticed on my own was that, (however obvious it might have been to others who have seen the film it took me a while to get it...) in the scene where Ennis is longingly holding the intertwined shirts, he is, 'in the closet', so to speak.This is not to say that I have reached a 'conclusion' as to whether Jack and Ennis were gay, bi or straight. I simply don't believe they need to be labeled as anything for that could very well distract from what this film really is about ~ genuine love. The harshness, cruelty and unforgiving-ness of society has crippled many, and Jack and Ennis are no exception. Taking into account their upbringing and environment, theirs was a love that never would have made sense to anyone around them, including Ennis himself. Though they may have cheated on their wives, they were cheated first by society out of what could have been an everlasting happiness. I have now realized that Ennis fell in love with Jack not because he was gay or straight, but because it was Jack. Jack entered Ennis' life like a gust of wind and left just as abruptly and was the only true love Ennis would ever experience. It's just a shame Ennis was unable to escape his past and the way he was taught.	5.0	Powerfully heart-wrenching	2008-05-10	11	9	2

The combination of crumbling families and discrimination forces the audience to mourn the pain of the characters, especially Heather Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams.This is a perfect example of how individuals weigh the importance of social acceptance with the overwhelming power of love.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2DJQD5OEOLV0K	Nathan Balko	It is unfortunate that people's innate prejudice towards homosexuality leads them to go into this movie with a closed mind. Too many of the reviewers seemed to have already made their mind up before even seeing this film. I went into this movie without expecting much either way. Needless to say, I was very impressed. The principle thing that stands out in my mind is Ang Lee's ability to convey so eloquently the conflicting love that these two men feel towards one another. Nothing ever feels forced, or in your face... more than anything you feel the resistance of the characters at every turn. This is what true love should really feel like, and it shows. Love can have no bounds, and seem impossible to restrain. This movie is a perfect example of this. I would gather that the same situation between people in a heterosexual light would gather rampant praise from all the homophobic people in this society. It is sad to say that they couldn't open their minds enough to appreciate the beauty of the film. Look, I can understand someone being put off by males kissing or what have you... but to those people I suggest maybe reading the short story that the movie was based off of first. The message is what is important, no matter how you obtain it.Pros:Excellent actingBeautiful cinematographyExcellent neutrality that leaves it up to the viewer to decide (although if you aren't swayed at least a little bit, the only explanation is a complete rejection of the story on your part)Great critique of the unnecessary sense of masculinity that affects both straight and gay males alikeCons:The initial sexual encounter between Jack and Ennis may be too quick for people who are not preparedI think this is one of those movies that you really just have to see for yourself, rent it if you must.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1C7BWPATO40VA	Nathan T.	"This is a movie that has gotten glowing reviews. IMO, it is a love it or hate it movie. I didn't really enjoy it much because, to put it plainly, it bored me to death. The movie drags on at a realistically paced soap opera. I admit the acting was decent and the story was alright, but it was really boring. I would definitely not watch this again, even on a boring rainy day with green eggs and ham.Problems:1. The plot of the movie isn't really complex. I won't say it since it'll spoil it for you.2. The love scenes and love relationship in general feels more like a fetish reenactment or a spare the moment ""I haven't gotten any for a long time"" kind of thing. The love never really hits a believable level where you're like ""yeah, they really care for each other even without the sex"". Sex is the limit of their love. I know the movie tries to portray it differently but come on now every time they meet there's always some sexual encounter. They never really build their relationship much past that point.3. The movie was extremely static and slow paced. If I was ever to be tortured, watching this movie again would probably be the finishing move.....4. Have anyone noticed that the characters don't really change physically even though they said it's been about 20 years or so? In the end when BLANK met his daughter, the daughter almost looked like his wife, the dad and the daughter looked almost the same age!5. No satisfactory conclusion. I guess that's how it works in real life but again it goes back to the pretty static plot. You would think that there's some sort of better resolve in the end, but it just feels like the whole moral of the movie was ""love sucks, don't get into it or you'll be like US (echo effect).I was seriously bored out of my mind. I just thought there would be something that would make this movie more rewatchable or rather....watchable at all. It just bored me to death. I'm very open to different types of movies, but yeah...My thoughts are: I think the only reason this movie got so much attention and overexaggeration is because of one single thing. HEATH LEDGER. Well, that and of course because it stands for homosexuality and the ever growing community which supports it WHICH probably explains the ratings."	3.0	Does Anyone Else Feel This Movie Is Overrated?	2010-06-28	22	1	21

While Brokeback Mountain took the controversy of Homosexuality and through it onto the table in front of the public's eye, it did not hold its own as a film.First and foremost, Brokeback Mountain was hardly revolutionary in regards to social tolerance.  Many motion pictures have portrayed gay men and women in a positive light.  In fact, television had a one up on Ang Lee's ""masterpiece"" when Will & Grace was aired.Despite the social impact (or lack thereof) Brokeback Mountain was a poorly made film.  The acting was mediocre at best, the adaption of the short story was nothing to write home about, and the story itself is in no way unique.  If one were to remove the ""gay"" aspect of the film one would find a shell that is the basic construction of any generic love triangle film that is designed to tug at the viewers heart strings.It is devestating that movies are now being judged on their social controversy rather than the exucution of the vital aspects of cinema."	3.0	What's the Big Deal?	2006-03-29	152	21	131

I'm amazed at the narrow-minded individuals who feel it necessary to judge the characters and their actions.

Ang Lee, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal made these people REAL  I am bereaved at the lost opportunity for a full loving life for these characters, and nothing that occurs to them or the tragic ""collateral damage"" of their relationship stretches credulity.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3M83S913YKNSD	Negri Gianfranco	"Absolutely amazing!This movie hit me like a shot to the heart.It's a beautiful story about deep and genuine love, denied by society.How could some - luckily, very few - critics slap the easy tag of ""gay cowboy movie"" on this film, I wonder?""Brokeback Mountain"" made me think about my own life, about the force of genuine feelings: those who are lucky enough to find true love in this - short - life should keep it like a treasure because this is ultimately what it counts.This film also made me think about the cruelty of some people, and the iniquities that homosexual people have suffered in different parts of the world, in different ages.I don't accept some criticism, according to which the characters are immoral because they are homosexual and cheat on their wives. Who said so didn't understand much of this film.Ennis has no tools to come to terms with his feelings and sexual attraction to Jack. He was brought up with a sense of horror towards homosexuality, which he considers as an aberrant condition to be ashamed of and repress: this is unfortunately what was taught to him. The social background he comes from doesn't enable him to cope with this situation.He literally swallows his feelings and hardly ever expresses them (well, he hardly ever speaks). He desperately tries to forget about Jack and Brokeback Mountain and live a ""normal"" life with his wife.But, as the movie poster tagline states, love is a force of nature, and you cannot resist to it: why should one's life be hell, just because they received a wrong education, subdued to religious dogmas or social conventions, I wonder?All the characters, including the two wives, are ultimately unhappy and defeated. But whose fault is it? Ennis's?I found his character deeply moving and absolutely realistic.Ang Lee's intent, however, is not to deliver a ""J'accuse"" movie, but just to recount a tragic and vivid love story between two human beings, like it was in the original Annie Proulx short narrative.This is Ang Lee's best film by far, and one the best movies I have ever seen; at least, the one which struck me the most.It may sound pathetic, but I must confess that it's been the very first time I cried for a film...I can't get out of my head its intense images, the laconic, unforgettable lines, its haunting music.The pacing is calm: the writer of the original short story, Annie Proulx, and the two screenwriters, McMurtry and Ossana, managed to depict this peculiar and, at the same time, universal American story (which is set in 1963-1983 Wyoming) with few but incisive masterstrokes.What makes this movie great is its perfect mixture of strong and poetic images (it's hard to believe they gave the Oscar for best cinematography to ""Memoirs of a Geisha""!), its melancholic music, the meaningful silence and facial expressions of the characters, the scarce mighty lines...There are no long dialogues: this would have been unrealistic, since it's ultimately two young (and later mature) uneducated cowboys, grown in the narrow spaces of a provincial rural society.The actors' performances are absolutely stunning: Heath Ledger is in my opinion the best of all, and it's a real shame he didn't get the awards he deserved! His astounding portrayal of Ennis does smack of loneliness and alienation.I was very disappointed too when I saw that the Academy Awards didn't give ""Brokeback Mountain"" the Oscar as best picture: I think this is outrageous and proves that the Academy Awards do not - too often in my humble opinion - mean quality, but, on the contrary, are just the result of unpredictable marketing strategies or old-fashioned ""ideologies"".In this case, I think many of the voters acted out their prejudices against a still controversial theme, that is, gay love and homosexuality, in the secret of their voting booths.Yet, I am glad this masterpiece received dozens of other accolades, among which the ""Leone d'Oro"" (the golden lion) at the Venice Film Festival, back at the film's world premiere in September 2005: being Italian myself, I'm proud we paved the way for such an amazing and moving piece of art."	5.0	A shot at the heart: a true masterpiece.	2006-03-25	94	76	18

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2959PY4ZOCXOH	Nick	"""Brokeback Mountain"" was the most nominated film this year in the Academy Awards with eight nominations, including the coveted categories of ""Best Picture,"" ""Best Actor,"" ""Best Supporting Actor,"" ""Best Supporting Actress,"" and ""Best Director."" ."" To much shock and upset, it failed to win ""Best Picture"" at the Academy Awards, an honor which it earned in almost every other major motion picture award show it was nominated for, marking it as one of the biggest snubs in Academy Award history. However, it did take home Oscar wins in the following three categories: ""Best Director,"" ""Best Adapted Screenplay"" and ""Best Original Score."" The movie itself has also gathered rave reviews by both major and local critics respectively. The New York Times gives it a remarkable grade of 100%, leaving some of the year's other top films, such as ""Capote"" behind at 90%. The film is a personal story of two brave young men, Ennis Del Mar, a ranch hand played brilliantly by Heath Ledger, and Jake Gyllenhaal gives a stellar performance as Jack Twist, a rodeo Texan cowboy. Ennis Del Mar is a character who is tortured, sensitive, taciturn who talks with a clenched fist expression and fails to look anybody straight in the eye. Jack Twist on the other hand is more open and gregarious character, willing to build a long lasting relationship with Ennis Del Mar, in which he fails repeatedly due to the rough time period the tale takes place. These two men unexpectedly fall in love in the summer of 1963, while sheepherding in the grasslands and mountainous terrain of Wyoming, which are clearly depicted through the film's mesmerizing pastoral cinematography. When the summer is over each man is faced with a painful decision of taking a separate path, which leads to both men getting married, having children and raising their own families. However, they still manage to keep in touch through mail and they visit frequently. In one of those visits, Alma Del Mar played stunningly by Michelle Williams, the woman who Ennis Del Mar marries and has two daughters with, comes to a startling revelation upon seeing her husband in a compromising position with Jack Twist outside her household, knowing that her husband cannot love her in return. Anne Hathaway equally excels in her portrayal of Lureen Newsome, the wife of Jack Twist who bears his only son, in a role that is more mature and far more different than her role in the previously known 2001 Blockbuster hit that made her famous, The Princess Diaries. The two men keep their secretive relationship ongoing for a twenty year period and the actors do very well in aging their characters, whether it is through the use of makeup, growing facial hair or deepening the voices and strengthening their accents. The movie's cliff hanger ending and soaring musical score is bound to haunt and puzzle viewers for a long time to come, with a bone-chilling effect that commences immediately after the film's screening, leaving viewers in awe and goosebumps. Overall, Heath Ledger delivers one of the best performances in the history of modern cinema as Ennis Del Mar; it is characterized as an ""acting miracle"" and critics have rightfully rated it equal to the greatest performances of actors Marlon Brando and Sean Penn respectively. Brokeback Mountain is an epic movie that really tugs at the heartstrings filled with drama, adventure, passion, sorrow, mystery, suspense, concealment, resentment, heartbreak, hardship, betrayal with a presence of several elements of humor and wit. The acting performances by the cast members are all superb, done with maximum soul on their part. Honestly, although I was initially hesitant to see this movie when it was originally released due to its controversial subject matter however, I'm really glad I did. Contrary to being labeled and parodied as a ""gay cowboy movie,"" after a couple of scenes the characters' sexual orientation becomes ambiguous, since although they differ from other individuals in that aspect they are still part of the human race, struggling to make a decent living in 1963 Wyoming. The movie lives up to its theme that love is nothing but a force of nature. I was blown away and found it to be one of the most powerful, touching and melancholic movies I have ever seen in my life. This movie is a must see for any individual that has an open mind, who is not offended by some scenes that depict violence,  strong language and some brief nudity, and generally any individual willing to see an overall well crafted movie. I give it ""two thumbs up."""	5.0	"THE EPIC OF ""BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN"" IS A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE!!!"	2006-04-10	40	34	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1129LM24YWSZV	"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw"""	"Brokeback Mountain is the tale of two cowboys, Ennis and Jack, who ranch sheep together one summer in the 1960's. One cold night, the two men huddle together in a tent to keep warm, and an explosive physical relationship erupts. They both agree that the night was a ""one-shot deal,"" but somehow the two men keep finding one another again, throughout the summer. After the ranching gig ends, both men nonchalantly tell each other goodbye, but the separation is painful for both. Cut to four years later - the men have gone their separate ways, married, had kids. But when they happen to see each other again, old feelings almost violently assert themselves, leading to a 20-year relationship that is by turns passionate, furtive, and tortured.First of all, performances by Heath Ledger (Ennis) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack) are unbelievable. I cannot adequately describe the performance work in this film. Ledger, who I'd only seen in fairly superficial roles - teen movies, not-so-great romantic comedies - totally transforms himself for this role. Tight-lipped, sun-baked, and shamed, his Ennis provides the tension in the film that powers the plot through to its final, saddening conclusion. Gyllenhaal plays Jack, the more honest, self-accepting of the two men, with an emotion that is strong enough to be real but restrained enough to epitomize the tough guy image of a Western. Both lend a haunting quality to the various ways in which Ennis and Jack try to live their lives, denied of the one thing they truly want.At the end of the day, Brokeback Mountain is a love story, the tale of two people who love each other but can't be together. This is not untrod territory in Hollywood. However, hanging this familiar storyline on a less-than-mainstream social topic for the movies - homosexuality - proves to be very powerful. The intensity of the two men's feelings for one another, and the delayed gratification that is the bedrock of their relationship, bring their experience into sharp focus for the viewer. Beautiful scenes of mountainous countryside and a strong, simple acoustic guitar accompaniment add to the poignancy. I just cannot recommend it highly enough. It will haunt you. It will make you think. It will move you.Fair warning - there is one brief sex scene between the two primary characters. If you don't warm to that idea, I recommend getting the film on DVD and fast-forwarding through that part. It is not worth missing the movie over."	5.0	Moving and life-changing	2006-12-22	93	87	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A17EQ0WOU7QS47	Nicole E. Beauchamp	I'll be 100% honest here and say I hate love stories. They are usually boring and predictable. I've enjoyed a select few, like The Notebook and Titanic, but never got into most others. Feeling random one day, I decided to purchase this DVD through amazon. I finally had the chance to sit down and watch it the other day and it was honest to God, AMAZING. The story was so realistic and heartwrenching. You feel like you are these two men. You actually can FEEL their emotions, both happy and sad. It's one of the best love stories of all time and also one of the saddest. Every minute of this movie is worth watching and I wish more movies could be so intense and amazing. This movie is a masterclass and everyone should have the chance to see it. Not only does it make for great entertainment, but it also makes you see people in a different light. I've never been homophobic, but if I was and saw this movie, I'd have a whole new respect for homosexuals. This movie helps you understand that love is love, no matter who anybody is with. It teaches you acceptance and that alone is a great reason to watch this dvd and support this wonderful director and these amazing actors!	5.0	One Of The Best Movies I've Ever Watched	2008-05-20	14	11	3

There ARE none to explain the gut-wrenching feelings in my heart.  I am a 67 year old grandma and I have NEVER felt like this about any other movie.  Brokeback sits in my heart...like NOTHING else ever has.  I saw this movie three weeks ago and I can't get it out of my mind.  I've tried...believe me.  It's brought forth the lost loves in my life...the pain and torture I've felt and the warmth I feel when reminiscing.  Every emotion I've ever felt has been SLAMMED back into my heart and soul.  Ennis...was ME!!  'Words always escaped me...I was always unable to voice my thoughts and feelings. Love would slip through my fingers because of my inability to hold on....FEAR...RAGE...LOVE...and sadness.  Heath Ledger has accomplished, in this movie, what no one ever has before.  He conveyed all these emotions without the inane chatter that most actors depend upon.  And Jack...what can I say about Jack?  He was all my loves...wrapped into one.  Loving, caring, open, honest, wanting but not 'getting'.  Broken hearted and SOOO hurt by Ennis' inability to open up to him.  It matters NOT that Ennis and Jack were men.  What matters is...the LOVE between two human beings.  Everlasting and true!!  I've never been so effected by a movie...EVER.  It will sit in my heart forever.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AS1B0NNSTH61X	nopeachoil	To be frank I wasn't sure how comfortable I felt watching a movie I knew would challenge what I'd been raised to believe when it came to love, but I finally bit the bullet, so to speak, and now I'm kicking myself for not watching this movie sooner.  While it started off a little slow, it grew into a beautiful narrative about love, life, regret and grief.  Although it is a love story between two men, which may jar some viewers at first, I soon forget that completely and was instead caught up in story so poignant, it left me in tears at the end, and had me doing some re-evaluating as well.Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack) and Heath Ledger (Ennis) give masterful performances, opening themselves up emotionally, so completely you can't help but believe their love for each other.  Without their willingness to smash the barriers of what films tend to portray as conventional love, this movie would have fallen flat.Jack and Ennis spend a summer on Brokeback sheep herding in the 1960s.  The two quickly develop a rapport which grows into much stronger feelings which they try to deny, until one chilly night when they share a tent to keep warm.  However, after that one night, both try to suppress their feelings, having grown up in a strong anti-gay society.  At the end of the summer, each man returns to their previous life having sworn the summer was a one-time deal.Immediately following that summer, Ennis marries his sweetheart, and has two daughters.  Jack moves to Texas to compete in the rodeo, and ends up marrying a cowgirl he meets on the tour, and has a son.  Four years later however, Jack comes back through Wyoming, and he and Ennis realize those long suppressed feelings are still there.  What follows is tortured affair that carries on over the next 16 years.  While Jack is willing to take a chance, to leave his wife and child, to be with Ennis, Ennis has such strong reservations, based on an event witnessed as a child, he cannot move past what he believes society expects of him including how,and who, he is supposed to love.  This movie brilliantly depicts the mental and emotional anguish that comes from being forced to live a lie at the hands of society.Yes, there is one sex scene between the two men, but it is brief and honestly you don't see much of anything.  While it may offend some people, you can easily fast-forward through that bit. But this movie is so much bigger than that one scene, and I would highly recommend watching this movie even if you are a little uncomfortable with the idea of two men together - it just might make you think about life and love a little differently.	5.0	Completely and utterly moving	2012-04-30	7	6	1

The music score is haunting and excellent.  There is a good reason Gustavo won the Oscar for his compositions.  Acting is top notch.  Heath Ledger raised his acting credibility by leaps and bounds.  I am truly sorry he did not win Best Actor for his heart wrenching performance in this film.  Lee's Direction is inspired and the cinematography breathtaking.For those who would condemn this film, I ask that you give it a chance.  Brokeback Mountain has no agendas.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A38UBVJEV1LLS7	NorthofCB	"What can be said about Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain... beautiful. I was so excited that it was expanding to my area, and I went to see it the first day of release. I had heard so much hype about the film that I was almost anticipating disappointment. I was wrong. Brokeback Mountain is a delicate film, full of life and splendor. The cast and writers handled the subject matter with elegance and passion, and the simpler aspects of the film, cinematography, etc. were just as well handled.I was so pleased with the cast of Brokeback Mountain. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaall made the perfect couple - sexy, dangerous, and forbidden.  Their chemistry was beyond description, and their love scenes were realistic and sensual. (The tent scene is unbelievable, I blushed through the entire thing). I could constantly feel their pain and longing - especially Gyllenhaal's character Jack - amazing. Furthermore, the women were just as fascinating. Anne and Michelle were able to achieve in a few short minutes what some actors fail to do in hours of dull film They were thoughtful and powerful; their reactions to their husbands' behaviors were unbelievable. I was crushed by Michelle, who is receiving most of the praise, and Anne, who is unjustly being overlooked. Her phone conversation with Ennis is one of the most moving scenes in the entire film.Ang, Heath, Jake, Michelle, and Anne's greatest achievement is their delicacy. They turned what could have been a ""gay cowboy"" film into a work of art. I think Ebert said it best. He came to the conclusion that the film is so affective because it does not focus on the ""gay"" issue but rather on the story and characters. Ennis, Jack, Alma, and Lureen are so real that the reason for their existence is a non-issue.  The is a story about love, passion, and pain, not about homosexuality and adultery. Brokeback Mountain does not preach or judge for or against the characters' actions, rather it seeks to tell a story - a rarity in Hollywood - and it does so flawlessly."	5.0	Beautiful Gem	2006-01-28	19	16	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A4FG1EZ8FBOFA	"Nova ""Pierre"""	Brokeback Mountain is a rare achievement in film making. Where the intention of the writers, along with the vision of the director and dedication of the actors marry into a wonderful and honest piece of work.This is a story of 2 men who struggle with their identities as they find love in the least expected of places. They try to fulfill the roles they were supposed to fill in society, but when love is denied it creates tragedy for all. The story is encompassing and quite remarkable in it's depth. The film is quite breathtaking to watch with it's open ranges and wide scope,balanced with claustrophobic alleys and tight rooms. The acting is stellar, and awe inspiring. You see the characters pains struggles and doubts in their mannerisms and tears.I thought i would write this film off when i first heard about it as simple a novelty act. I am pleased to see i was absolutely wrong. This was an example of exactly what movies were always meant to be, an extraordinary story telling.Due to the material i'm sure there will be plenty of people spewing hateful reviews without having seen the film. I can only state someone secure in their own beliefs and sexuality should not be threatened by a 2 hour film. Nor should they feel the need to share their insecurity and immaturity with people who are just looking for suggestions on a good film. If you are curious about this film at all, i recommend judging for yourself. it's not a message film, it's a love story. A gut-wrenching affecting heart pounding love story. One that i think everyone should see.	5.0	A truly wonderful film..	2006-03-18	48	41	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A11B6LNU5MS6V	N. Sturm	Brokeback Mountain has become a punchline in our culture, and I think that's a shame because it's really a pretty good movie.  Near as I can tell, there are three camps of people who don't like it: those who will never accept a movie about homosexuality, those who think it's just too slow and long, and those who think its plot and characterization actually do a disservice to LGBT individuals.  I have a few things to say to that last group:Brokeback Mountain is a tragic story about lovers who can't be together... so they're (ambiguously) gay this time, it's not really different than having them be from different races or social classes as is typical.  Point is, most viewers knew this story wasn't going to turn out well just because of the genre.  It's not punishing the main characters for having a homosexual relationship.  I know it's about time we had some movies in which the gay characters got a happy ending--however, those movies will doubtless not be set in the American south in the 1960s.Another common complaint I see is that Ennis especially was not a sympathetic character, and that most viewers felt sorry for both men's neglected wives.  My response to that is, don't you think you were supposed to?  The women didn't do anything wrong.  They got a raw deal too.  But this is a movie about unhappy people, and furthermore, *imperfect* people.  For crying out loud, do people expect every movie protagonist to be somebody they could be best friends with?  I don't like Ennis, really; he's aggressive and cold to both Alma and Jack.  That doesn't mean the story doesn't work, and that doesn't mean all gay(ish) people are implied to be unlikeable.Lastly, lots of people feel the homosexual scenes look awkward and observe the heterosexual relationships get more screentime.  They've got a point about that second part, but I think the apparent difficulty that the actors have seeming intimate suits their characterization, even if it wasn't intentional.  Jack is more comfortable with his orientation or whatever than Ennis, but neither of them really understands their own feelings or wants to be different from the norm.  So if you're looking for a movie about the triumph of gay true love...  maybe consider watching Maurice?  The novel it's based on was considered subversive in its day for having a gay relationship turn out well.  As I see it, though, Brokeback Mountain is about characters, not issues.  It's not out to change the world; if you ask it to, you're going to be disappointed.	4.0	Watch it for what it is.	2013-02-23	6	6	0

I never really planned on seeing this movie, but now hearing all the controversy once again stirred up by all the judgmental religious hypocrites, I decided to go see it. Very glad that I did! I still prefer King Kong for Best Picture of 2005 but this is a close running second for me! I was amazed by both of these lead actors. They were both phenomenal in this movie. They made you feel every feeling that they were each feeling. Plus, I was able to relate to this because this kind of thing does happen. And I speak from experience (minus the whole cowboy theme).Living your life not being true to your heart is such a tragedy and that is the biggest message I left this movie with. I didn't expect it to end like it did but with that, Heath Ledger was amazing! He was absolutely brilliant in this film. The whole cast of this movie did a wonderful job and I hope that Heath does bring home the Oscar. Would have been nice if his x-girlfriend Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar for her brilliant work in King Kong.  Would have been neet to see them both win an Oscar on March 5th.Well, Brokeback Mountain is a really great movie! Thank you to Ang Lee for putting it together so beautifully!

Never before have  I seen two characters protrayed on the screen which have touched me in such a meaningful and extraordinary way. I cried and cried as their love affair fell apart from the 1963 Brokeback meeting right through to their final separation.This was a stunning love affair, between two people, which moved from the physical and sexual side onto a higher and more meanigful plain in the end. Sadly it took death to move it into this realm, a fact that all of us seem to forget, and with death it is to late to act.I fell in love with Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar right from the start of this story and I can only take my hat off to the fine acting, wonderful script, and fantastic music.It made me question myself and question my life.

Not only is the acting outstanding but the story is very true to life. The film has earned over 70 million dollars at the box office and has earned 8 nominations. For the first time in my life, I just sat through the 78th Academy Awards show. WHAT A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!! This wonderful film lost to Crash? Why? I watched Crash a couple days ago and it was like watching a poor version of All in the Family. But at least with All in the Family you got a laugh. The only thing good about Crash were the closing credits. Unfortunately I had to attempt twice to see the ending of Crash as I kept falling asleep. Tonights award show just proves that this type of show is just another political statement. I don't believe the votes have anything to do with the movie. I think it is just politics and I will never waste 3 hours of my life to watch this type of trash awards show again.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A13GAETJLXW87F	"Outstanding Tank ""OT"""	"By telling the story of two cowboys in love, this movie was sure to explode into the public concious, and the only question on my lips was whether the film would justify its popularity or was merely going to gain acclaim for its controversial subject matter.The movie follows the lives of two cowboys, Ennis and Jack.  Originally working together in isolation as sheep herders on ""Brokeback Mountain"", Ennis (Heath Ledger) is charged with staying at camp, cooking and cleaning, while Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) stays in the field with the sheep, protecting them from coyotes, only to return to camp for meals - already a domestic divide is introduced and the idea of them depending upon each other is formed.In the solitude of the mountains a sexual relationship beings  between the two men.  However, their employment is terminated prematurely and the two men say goodbye to each other to live their seperate lives; get married, have children.  One day Ennis receives a postcard from Jack suggesting they meet up, and from that point an on-and-off affair takes place between the two lovers over the next twenty years, with the pair meeting every few months to stay at Brokeback Mountain, the only place the two men can find refuge to love each another.  The mountain becomes an oasis where they can truly be themselves, however it is created at the expensive of their other relationships.Superb acting between the two front men enguages the audience in to the story, however, it is the acting of the supporting cast, especially Ennis' wife (Michelle Williams), that really ground the project into reality and the audiences emotional centre - Williams would even ask her co-actors Ledger and Gyllenhaal to passionately kiss offscreen to help fuel her emotional performance; a task showing all threes commitment to the script.This is a chaotic story of two men that are not comfortable in finding comfort with each other, cannot possibly find comfort in a society that doesn't accept them (as pointed out by Ennis' tale of the two men that lived together only for one to be publicly lynched) and don't find comfort in their hetrosexual relationships.  It is so deep in messages that trying to pinpoint them all would be to insult Ang Lee's vision; watch the film, at worst, it's a little drawn-out and slow, at best, it's life-changing."	5.0	Cowboys, Love and Society	2006-01-21	25	22	3

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1IYXWIF9XVY7K	"Part-Time Dreamer ""Dancing Pianist"""	I've seen over 130 movies of 2005, and Brokeback Mountain was clearly the BEST for me. This movie is groundbreaking, beautiful and incredibly haunting. I can't get this movie out of my head for an entire week after I saw this movie, and I was moved & touched so profoundly & deeply.The acting of this movie was fabulous, Jake Gyllenhaal & Michelle Williams both did a great job, and Heath Ledger, all I can say is WOW! I never knew he was this amazing before I saw this movie.  His magnificent performance is miraculous. He seems to tear it from his insides, and he breathes his character so truthfully & brilliantly. His performance in this movie will be watched and admired for years to come as a landmark in acting. Bravo!Another strength of this movie is the simplicity and strong symbolism of the way the story is told. The story-telling is so genuine, like the characters' feelings for one another, you won't realize how powerful it is at first. But by the conclusion, with its definitive, heart-wrenching portrayal of what will always be divided and what can never be, you will realize that the story has entered its souls.The cinematography was mesmerizing, those images were so beautiful, and they just keep coming back to reassure you. The music score was also remarkable, and it captured the essence & emotion of the film flawlessly.This adaptation stays true to the original short story and the two lead actors fit the roles perfectly. Solid work all around and with Ang Lee's vision, they have created an amazing piece of cinema that should not be missed by anybody. Kudos to the phenomenal director of this film - Ang Lee. Thank you so much for making this wonderful masterpiece.This is a powerful movie that totally worth checking out. Besides, this film will live with you for a long, long time. As for me, it will live with me FOREVER!	5.0	An amazing trip to the Heartbreak Mountain!!!	2006-03-27	51	44	7

Granted, the movie is better than the book. There are more characters. But still, it's just not that great. There's a lot of beautiful scenery in this movie though and good acting.

First of all the ""out of nowhere"" love scene looked more like a prison rape than it did a show of affection between two men, the spitting on the hand for some lubricaton..YEAH!! that was real classy (sarcasm noted)..Then the two cowboys spent the rest of the film claiming that they were ""not queers"", as if it were something to be ashamed of..and what about Enis's backwards wife..I mean c'mon, what woman would have kept that secret for twenty years and not have confronted her gay husband ...GET REAL..Horrible cast of characters, I couldn't believe for one second that Enis and Jack were really in love...If Jack really loved Enis why did he have relations with at least two other men in the film (the dude in Mexico, and the other Rancher)..This movie set gay men back another twenty years with its stereotypes and ..big deal two cowboys kissed..was I really supposed to be shocked???  ....Oh yeah, and can anyone tell me what Enis said at the very end of the movie when he was looking at the postcard..I'm sure it was important, but all I could hear was more of Heath Ledgers's bad acting and mumbled voice, and didn't make out a word he said."	1.0	HORRIBLE..This film sets gay men back another 20 years	2006-04-12	151	46	105

I however found it boring and pointless.  I would like to know how these two fell in love.  I would have liked to see more of the emotions that compelled these two reluctant men to form a relationship.  I was left with just random mumblings.  I have not read the story, but I'm thinking it is probably much better than the film.  I can see that there was a good story to be told within, but it was just not explored.  I am sorry this movie wasn't what it could have been.  I don't recommend it.  Obviously it found its fallowing, as there are 100s of wonderful reviews out there.

I've seen the movie 11 times now, 4 in the theatre, the rest on DVD, never get tired of it, keep finding new little details and nuances, still made me cry 3 times.  An absolutely classic, heartbreaking, work of art.  Once someone told me a tattoo was something ""they"" could never take away from you.  I guess I feel the film Brokeback Mountain is something ""they"" can never take away from me.  I would also urge anyone who watches it, to go all the way through the final credits and listen to both the songs.  think of them as Ennis's feelings as he continues through his life alone, up to being the old cowboy who Annie saw in a bar and inspired the story in the first place.  and say a little prayer of thanks for everyone who made this movie."	5.0	Still love it after 11 times	2006-05-24	29	27	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ABFP751WE000A	Paul S. Cilwa	Just as a Doris Day romantic comedy doesn't apply just to blonde women, Brokeback Mountain doesn't apply to just gay men. In fact, the characters aren't particularly gay, certainly not in the sociological sense. What they are, is lonely, isolated--not just on the mountain, but in their inability to express their emotions--and when they find each other, it's like the fracturing of a dam.Yet, the walls of the dam remain. The time on Brokeback is temporary; unreal; in the real world, the men remain stifled. The Ledger character, in particular, is held back by his childhood traumas from allowing himself intimacy. So his marriage fails; his girlfriends leave; all he has to look forward to is the occasional return to the idyll of Brokeback Mountain with his friend. Both men need more from each other, but Ledger's character is unable, so fearful of intimacy that he uses the excuse of prejudice to deny himself the one relationship that means everything to him.Buy this movie not to see actions or speed, as that's not what the movie is about, but to receive the warning message and the wakeup call for all of us.	5.0	True Love and True Tragedy	2006-05-31	23	19	4

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1VYS32DFN8JZX	Paul Wheelock	This is a perfect film.  Never has the topic of love between two men been so perfectly and accurately depicted.  The short story by Annie Proulx is heart wrenching, the screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Dianna Ossana is sensitively developed into a complex exploration of self damage and collateral damage as a result of repression and isolation and Ang Lee brings that screeplay to life never pulling any punches.  The actors, Health Ledger, Jake Gyllenhall, Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams, perfectly embody their characters and make them real; we know these characters; we are these characters.  Brokeback Mountain is an accurate depiction of the terror and heartbreak of gay love as a result of society's mores and the unavoidable result of self hate and its consequences.

I was expecting the worst as I had heard from the conservative Christian side, but I was suprised with a good story which was almost believable if I could put myself into the early 1960's. The story is a story of love and infatuation and of infidelity, but at the same time it brings issues of prejudice and the boundaries of love into question. The movie doesnt give us answers, but leaves the viewer with little resolution. I like this becasue it made me think and process the many ideas and boundary breaking ideas that are presented.

So, without going into the details of the script, acting and cinematography, all of which are top-notch, I will say that I found the film to be a tragedy of two people's lives who try to live within societal norms instead of following what is inside their hearts.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2N9E02BZYBU7K	"Plom de Nume ""Rob"""	"Some lovely cinematography and an instantly riveting character study from Heath Ledger had us straight into ""watching a new classic"" mode. Shades of The Last Picture Show, liberal overtones of late, elegiac Pekinpah and even a hint of Butch and Sundance in both the budding buddiness, the banter and the long landscape vistas. There is also, of course, the original hook of ""men's men"" bonding extending into the erotic - cowboy physicality turning sexual in what is conveyed, with lyrical toughness, as undeniably, perfectly natural in this wild, beautiful location.From the compelling opening, the affair matures and gathers poignancy, evolving from sweet infatuation to tragic separation, as the smitten pair struggle to make ""conventional"" family lives work after they leave the lovely eponymous setting of their first meeting. The film has enough generosity to portray these doomed ""normal"" lives with dignity, too, evoking equal sympathy for the sensitively-studied heterosexual partners with whom our protagonists attempt to build some kind of ""acceptable"" reality beyond the mountain. The film's initial strengths combine to make you want these guys to get back together on a permanent basis with exactly the same romantic fervour you'd normally apply to star-crossed lovers of the Shakespearian (or even Sleepless in Seattle) variety.What a pity, then, that the story outstays its welcome by about half an hour. The sexual tension to which we've been attuned begins to weaken as Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is outpaced by Ledger's. The former appears to find the conveyance of ageing as much of a challenge as James Dean did in Giant. Gyllenhaal tends to fall back on the drop-your-head for a big-eyed look-up school of appeal, which is fine for Disney but not so effective in sustained, gritty tragedy. You find yourself longing for the beauty and poignancy of John Voight's glorious Joe Buck in Midnight Cowboy. Instead, you get the Gyllenhaal signature doe-eyes (with, of course, a cool mouth-twist to denote post-millennial irony). Our Jake has gone unchallenged for too long, now: his reputation is the sum of great parts, rather than performances - in other words, luck. I hope he finds a script and a director to really stretch him soon.As for this increasingly dreary, one-note piece, there's a precise moment when I felt my attention begin to slacken, long about the time Ledger's character is sitting in a rainy car on yet another miserable day telling his daughter he doesn't think it would be a good idea for her to move in with him. One sigh and rustle of denim too many, I think, one too many raindrops on a windscreen; a bit too much wind.It's a waste of some great work to let the early energy peter out in melancholy indulgence like this. Blame Ang Lee, as well: he clearly thinks he's earned the time to depress us at length (when, actually, we've become well-invested in the story and are starting to look for narrative outcome and, if not redemption, at least some form of closure). The final test of how let down we felt is in our response to what could have been a decent, downbeat ending - if only Ledger had been encouraged to articulate the actual last line with a little more clarity. Instead, as a nice deep focus window-landscape fade went into the credits, over a swell of the simple, moving score, what we thought we heard was something between ""Sheergar's where?"" and ""Day-Care sore."" A sense of emotional short-change led swiftly into levity and undermined a lot of the decent efforts before, a feeling of ""Well, if you can't be bothered to let us hear what could have been a poignant anti-climax, we can't be bothered to take your whole point seriously."" The stronger aspects of the film deserve a much better, more disciplined last reel or so.Having deciphered the last line from Internet research, the next test would be whether we could watch it through again, so as to avoid the unfortunate bathos of Ledger's Last Gargle. Well, we can't; we'd rather watch Crash a third time. Ultimately, then, Brokeback Mountain's promise is allowed to sag, and we have to conclude that there are better male love stories. Maturin and Aubrey in Master and Comander, for one example. The Odd Couple for another. And far better, more complete films. Like Crash.Brokeback Mountain is certainly worth a viewing; but I suggest you look up the last line before setting aside the gloomy hours required to get to it. And rent, don't buy.And now (a week or so later), I'll append a counter to a counter to me, if I may:-Although this facility is best used to air considered individual opinions, it's also reasonable for us to offer temperate comments (and, where appropriate, counter-comments) on each other's views. What ""Reviewer"" (above) likes to call ""contravesry"" (sic) is the essence of healthy exchange. Just because you disagree with my critique of a film you like, however, is no basis for childish slurs on my integrity and accusations of lack of intelligence. Hating people because their tastes are different is the kind of thinking that leads to prejudices such as racism and homophobia.Reviewer judges my contribution incorrect, prejudged, and shallow. Well, I'm standing by what I liked: ""lovely cinematography"" and a ""riveting character study from Heath Ledger""; I'm sticking with my comparisons to The Last Picture Show and late, elegiac Pekinpah. I repeat that I found the (homo)sexuality ""conveyed, with lyrical toughness, as undeniably, perfectly natural in this wild, beautiful location,"" and admired the film's ""generosity"" to the cowboys' doomed heterosexual partners. I'll even repeat: ""Brokeback Mountain is certainly worth a viewing."" I trust that such features of my original review caused relatively little apoplexy in Reviewer.Having said that, I also claim the right to reiterate my unfavourable comparison with Midnight Cowboy; to say again that I found the tale ""increasingly dreary""; and that I felt a ""sense of emotional short-change"" from the director's ""melancholy indulgence."" By then, I guess Reviewer's tantrum was well under way. Indeed, my sin of ""incorrectness"" probably began with the qualification that the ""stronger aspects of the film deserve a much better, more disciplined last reel or so.""So - as for shallow? I'd say I was fair. I took the time to watch the thing; took the time to construct a review that discussed positive and negative aspects of the piece, giving credit where due; even took the time to look up Ledger's garbled valediction. And prejudged? Only in so far as I actually wanted to appreciate this movie. It's just that certain elements, such as its indulgent length, one lead's performance and occasional unintelligibility of the dialogue wouldn't allow me to love it as much as the movie and its adulators clearly thought it deserved. In fact - as I said - the flaws left me feeling cheated at a great opportunity narrowly missed through lack of discipline and a reliance on the ""issue"" itself for depth, rather than cinematic quality.Incorrect? Well, that's a matter of opinion, isn't it? It's why we have different reviewers giving different assessments. But I do think the use of ""incorrect"" is very telling, as it looks to me like the objections to my review are rather based on perceived political incorrectness than on critical inaccuracy.Reviewer is clearly a big fan of Brokeback. Indeed, ""...my family, and friends, and just about everyone I know watched this movie at least 5 times in theatre, and have all bought the DVD release."" OK, in conclusion, I'll refrain from urging Reviewer to get a life in favour of a counter counter-request for a little more balance and a mind a little more widely open to the valid, reasonably expressed views of others - rather more in keeping with the spirit of the film than his own less than charitable, pejorative outburst."	3.0	When Harry Met Harry, with Stetsons but minus the laughs	2006-05-03	53	7	46
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AB1UMC7SB9D7Z	"PolarisDiB ""dibness"""	"Two cowboys in Wyoming are just looking for work when one day they happen to get the same job herding sheep about Brokeback Mountain.  For a while it's a day-in, day-out job as they slowly get tired of beans, but then, one cold night, they get a bit drunk, they get a bit confused, and the next thing you know they're in love but don't know how to deal with it.  The story follows their lives over the years as they try and manage families, keep their secrets, and yet still find time to see each other despite living in different states and having completely different lives.It's a slow, but beautiful build-up to their relationship, and then once it gets its momentum and finally starts moving, the film just gets better and better.  Compliments, of course, are towards the performers (including the supporting actors) and the direction, and a lot of this films mythic quality is on the absolutely gorgeous shooting of the Brokeback Mountain area, the only really open area shown in the film--obviously because Ennis and Jake feel rather restricted by the normal world around them.It's a good conceit, and a good theme, and tales of forbidden love and social commentary are great too.  Unfortunately, this movie isn't free from its moments of camp... like in the tent, when Jake and Ennis are looking at each other and I couldn't help thinking, ""But baby, a man's got needs!""  Or the shot of the gutted sheep, and all the time it allows around it for one to think, ""Well ain't ever'one feelin' gutted today?""  Or when Jake and his wife are out with the society couple and the woman is talking about ""Men never ask their wives to dance,"" and of course the obvious response would be something like, ""Well that's 'cause I want to dance with your man!""I'd cite more examples, but I'd neither want to spoil it or completely ruin it for you, for afterall, unintentional humor aside, the story just keeps getting more and more involving until it finally hits it's real stride, with some pretty unforgettable moments and unforgettable emotion.  Thus it is, in its own way, quite an acheivement.  Even nice little touches like the fireworks behind Ennis when he gets angry at the bikers and some rather abstract shots in the beginning keep this film engaging enough to ask us, gently, to have patience with it until it gets to where it's been meaning to go.--PolarisDiB"	4.0	An achievement in its own way	2006-02-27	25	12	13

I knew it was a short story book that came out in 1997 but I had never got around to reading it, so when I heard it was going to be released as a movie I was thrilled. Brokeback Mountain has garnered up many awards and nominations in the past few months. Many people have a problem with the film simply because it is what they call a ""gay love story"". This film is about 2 man having to come to terms with the love they feel so strongly for each other in a society that does not accept things that are not considered the norm. In the movie the men marry women and have kids, and try to live as normal life as they can only seeing each other a few times a year on what they refer to as fishing trips. Yet as time passes them both by they never forget how love touched them that one time and is lasting them through there lifetime. I highly recommend this movie and encourage anyone with an open mind to check it out. Brokeback Mountain is a movie about 2 people who fall in love and despite what labels people may give it thats truly what this amazing film is about. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give amazing performances especially Heath. I believe this film is going to sweep the Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards not because it deals with 2 guys who love each other but because of the way it deals with the universal thing we all know and that is 2 people being in Love. Not everone can choose who they choose to love."	5.0	Brokeback Mountain is an awesome movie about a universal thing called LOVE	2006-01-08	16	7	9

Sometimes in life an experience will come along that will change, if not define, an individual's life. Regardless it's content a deeply moving experience will forever rest inside the individuals soul, as will Ennis' love for Jack and this movie will for me.'Brokeback Mountain' is one of the finest American love stories I have encountered in some time. It's passion is intense and palpable. The character's of Ennis and Jack, as portrayed brilliantly by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, are caring, passionate, loyal, and tortured souls. Where Jack is more willing to accept his feelings and spend his life with the one he loves in this case Ennis, whom he falls in love with while watching after sheep on Brokeback mountain, Ennis lives with the fear and frustration of knowing such a courtship will not be accepted by the masses in Wyoming.Instead they go on with their lives, doing the proper things; get married, have kids, work hard long jobs. Their only solace coming from an annual fishing trip that allows them time alone to share their true emotions. The two men age and their lives fall apart around them, only their feelings for one another remain.I've choosen not to give too many details away about the story and the film. I recommend any one interested to see for themselves. 'Brokeback Mountain' is one of the most moving and haunting films of the past few years. It's a true work of beauty about love, loss, and the human spirit.'Brokeback Mountain' is many things to many people. Most of all it is an unescapable example of a love void of boundaries.	5.0	Unescapable	2006-03-22	51	42	9
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1GBINHNAQWVC9	"Prabal ""All paths lead to God..."""	To see two mainstream actors performing intimate sexual scenes was shocking at first. But both actors are indeed great masters of the art of drama. They perform with full aplomb, their explosive rendition of raw emotions do not seem contrived or artificial. Amply supported by the female characters who are just -oh- so  natural. The director has done a superb job; to have extracted such gamut of emotions from all the actors' is a feat by itself. Of course the most impressive of all actors is Heath Ledger. He is in one word just Superb, one was so tired of the Aussie brigade with their emphasized accents (Russel Crowe), limited acting caliber ( Nicole Kidman - with forehead perpetually frozen by Botox),  sheer ugliness ( Cate Blanchet) and pretension to intellectuality (Mel Gibson ) - that Ledger seems to be a revelation of sorts. Enhanced by a superb screenplay, mind-blowing locales and explosive content it is but a MASTERPIECE. A CLASSIC OF OUR TIMES! One is indeed so lucky to have been able to see this movie!ABOUT THE AUTHOR: ANNE PROULXI will talk only about Brokeback Mountain. Annie's style is of clipped sentences, disjointed words that produce a remarkable semblance of intense empathy for her characters. The sexual content of this story is highly sensual and seem terrifyingly real as if the scenes leap out from the pages of the book. She is a highly stylized writer and commands a unique mastery over the usage of language that in a way creates a league of which she is the sole owner. Her finely etched characters seem so absolutely real that you feel a surge of pain when Jack Twist dies.She exhibits explosive finesse towards the end as the main protagonist Ennis enters a twilight zone, bereft of friends, family and most importantly his soul mate Jack Twist. Ennis is poor and living in abject poverty, pining for his love and pining so hard that you as a reader almost lament the death of Jack Twist. You're assured that it is the end of the line for Ennis. A hopeless existence, a mere pretence of a life! Now, he dreams about Jack and wakes up crying or having ejaculated in sleep. This is real melodrama; the writer gifts Ennis's hopelessness to you. You're forced to introspect your own life and come up with parallels, for instance, I still dream of not doing well in my exams and waking up thinking I have failed.This is a remarkable gift that this writer possesses for this is not a story but an almost unwanted intrusion into your own life. A chance to revise your own unfulfilled dreams, little tragedies, sorrows and the same feeling of helplessness that is now the fate of Ennis. Such was the brilliance of her dialogues that they were used in tact on the movie version. This shows the caliber of the writer. Absolutely riveting, a dazzling piece of work, exquisite execution and rendition akin to a beautiful song - This is a Major Literarywork.	5.0	Shocking!

My response is: big deal?This movie crossed the boundaries many viewers place on themselves about how ""human beings"" should behave. In fact, I am sure that many female viewers of this movie understand more about the ""attraction"" and ""love"" that made and destroyed these two characters better than most men do. But putting all that aside, I think all of us can agree that this movie has many extraordinary values, and if we can accept these values, or even appreciate these values for the true messages this movie delivers, then doesn't it just make sense that, whatever your viewpoint is, this is still a movie worth watching?Great job hollywood, keep up the good work."	5.0	Truly Extraordinary	2006-06-01	30	26	4

Even in today's society when people are driven to excel in their intelligence, it is a wonder that such idiotic remark still exist. Therefore, I feel compiled to give this individual a wake up call so that she can keep up with the worldThis reviewer, obviously, is looking at every movie like an action movie. The misfortune of the two characters, and their fate, caused by a propaganda driven society, and the love and affection shared by the two men obviously meant nothing to this reviewer. The pain, the delicacy, and the plot, also, become a bore to this individual. This reminds me of my literature professor a few years back when he said that ""the greatest works in literature can only be appreciated by the intelligent.""Worst, this reviewer is showing classic sign of a brain so blasted by rock music that she cannot appreciate the level of sensations expressed by the music. The soft touch of the acoustic guitar triggers a bitter sweet feeling, and expressed the scenery as if the music itself is painting a picture. Of course, this means nothing to a senseless brain.The worst felony this reviewer committed, however, is her criticism in the acting skills in this movie. Obviously, the characters of this movie demand that the actors and actresses these qualities, which is very well done. I have no idea why someone would feel that this film is poorly acted, except if the opinion of someone who has been numbed by modern day action movies.The review, alone, shows that the reviewer is a self righteous, brain dead person with inferior intelligence from the level of this movie. This can be seen when she said that she read about 1000 reviews, when there are only around 800, and that 20% is written by the same person, suggesting that around 160 reviews are written by the same person.

When I heard all of the buzz surrounding this movie, I had to see for myself what all of the fuss was about. I must admit, I was reluctant to purchase the video at first due to my own conservative attitudes. But I am glad I changed my mind. If you enjoy nothing else about Brokeback Mountain, the breath taking cinematography alone is worth the price of the video. Heath and Jake give stellar performances in this movie and they deserve every award they received even if they didn't receive the oscar. It takes true actors to pull off a role like this and these guys more than deliver. The power of Brokeback  Mountain lies not in what Ennis and Jack say and do to each other, instead it lies in what they don't say and do. The silence is so loud in this film. From the very first scene when they first meet, they never even say hello. They never really make eye contact but instead steal nonchalant glances at each other. This scene sets the tone for the entire movie. Even the most naive person can see the chemistry between the two men. Throughout the entire movie their feelings are never verbally expressed. For instance neither Jack nor Ennis ever say the words ""I love you."" Again it is in their silence that they say the most.  Some people condemn the movie as promoting homosexuality. First of all sexuality can not be promoted. If a person is gay or straight they were probably that way all along. Watching a movie would not influence them one way or the other. Others lament over these guys getting married and raising kids while maintaining their relationship. Yes, infidelity is wrong and it always will be wrong. But it has existed since the beginning of time and will continue to exist forever. If you would lay down your fundamentalist gavel and see the film with an open mind, you can no longer deny its brilliance. You don't nessesarily have to agree with the subject and contents of a movie to enjoy it. I for one can enjoy a movie for what it is. Just that, a movie and nothing more. I am proud to have this film as a part of my video collection and you will too. Anyone with half a heart and an ounce of compassion will be moved by this piece of cinema. I gotta admit however I was a bit disappointed with the ending. I thought the movie would have been even more moving if Ennis had honored Jacks final request and spread his ashes on Brokeback. But I'm not the director. Maybe mister Ang lee thought it was best to leave this way. But can you just visualize an emotionally stricken Ennis on horseback riding into the sunset with his lovers ashes being tossed into the winds on Brokeback Mountain. I felt this would have given the movie an ever more powerful emotional impact. It was also unclear to me as how Jack was killed. Did he die the way his wife says or was he severely beaten to death? Despite these minor technicalities the movie is still worth seeing. Give Brokeback Mountain a chance and I guarantee by the end of the film, after wiping away tears, the only word you will be able to utter is ""Beautiful""."	5.0	A beautiful piece of cinema	2006-04-07	25	19	6

I read somewhere that the author of the short story had the same problem, she said that it took a while for the characters to leave her.  I can understand why.  This movie brought back alot of memories and feelings in me that lay dormant.  No other film has done that to me ever. The music was appropriate, the cinematography was breathtaking, and the acting and directing was superb.  The best thing about this movie is that the it really doesn't hit you during the film, it hits you really hard right after.  I watched the film a third time with a friend of mine who said she enjoed it.  The next day, she told me that she kept thinking about the film and it had affected her later.

It is a story that every person on earth can relate to - and will feel a kinship with.The story is so real, you will relate to it immediately, no matter who you are.  We have all known these characters, and as a result, we know that what we are seeing is real.  What we are seeing is actually every day life - things in OUR OWN world - which is why the tragedy of the story has such a tremendous impact upon everyone who sees it.  The fact that Jack & Ennis are cowboys is inconsequential; this story takes place with different characters across the globe, in Wyoming, in Kenya, in Nepal, in Poland, in Uruguay...I recommend that you see this film at LEAST twice.  Even if you do not blink throughout the movie, you will miss things if you only see it once.  Ang Lee has packed so many details into every frame that it is impossible to pick up on everyone in one viewing.Books and doctoral dissertations will be written about this film.  There is THAT MUCH brilliance put into it.  The comparisons to Homer's Aeneid and to Plato's Banquet, the yin and yang of Ennis driving across the mountainous expanse in one direction at the beginning of the film and then riding in the other direction at the end, the meaning of the color blue in the film, the astonishing camera-work in the final scene between Jack and Ennis, the stunning scene in which Ennis discovers the shirts in Jack's bedroom, and so much more will be written about and studied for decades to come.""Brokeback"" is a must-see also for at least 7 of the most brilliant acting performances ever put on film.  Heath Ledger's career and life will be transformed forever by the unforgettable brilliance of his portrayal of Ennis.  Even author Annie Proulx has indicated that Ledger understoof Ennis better than she did, and she created the character!  Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams also moved into the Big Leagues of Acting with their brilliant performances, which will delight and haunt you. Anne Hathaway is superb as the beautiful gal who becomes more blonde and stilted with every year of her loveless marriage.  The actors who play Jack's parents will leave you stunned with the perfection of their brief yet terrifying look into the world of the Twist family, and Linda Cardellini is extraordinary in her role.The film is very true to the story.

I asked my husband if he wanted to see it, and understood when he said, ""Maybe in the privacy of our own living room.""  I went to a matinee in our small town, and was the only person in the room--it was divine. From the first close-up I was entranced--Ang Lee promising me that I would really get to know these characters.  He kept his promise.You know the story; I'm not here to re-tell it.  What I would like (need, actually) is to relate is how it affected me:For days afterward, Ennis would whisper new insights to me: ""Did you get that when she asked to move to town, she was asking me to give up ranch life, which was all that I had?""  No, Ennis.  I missed that.  Thank you.And then, ""Wasn't it considerate of Jack not to tell me that the Brokeback boss had seen us [intimately] together?""  Oh, yes, Ennis.  It was.  He loved you that much.I talked about the movie a lot with my husband, and he listened.  I assured him that if he decided to see the film that it must be on the big screen.  Some things are just too good--too big--to be first-viewed on DVD.Together, we went to Sunday's matinee.  My partner of nearly 40 years was moved more than either of us would have imagined.  In his own sweet way, he had been waiting for me to test the waters, then allowed me to lead him in.  I am thrilled that we were able to share the experience, and it continues to spur much, soulful conversation between us.I didn't cry the first time I saw Brokeback, but Sunday, after Ennis's final line, and all through the credits, tears came in a way I have never experienced--a tear at a time, alternating eyes.  I swear, I would lightly dab the corner of one eye, then the other, and so on, feeling like I could have done it for hours.This film not only made me proud to be a writer and gave me a deeper understanding of my beloved gay friends from my theatre days, but has restored my faith in humanity.  It is a visual masterpiece.  Pure, cinematic genius.  A hauntingly beautiful love story that expands and enlivens the heart.

I wanted to like this movie, I wouldn't go see a movie that I wasn't interested in. Most of the characters were forgetable for the most part. That isn't a negative thing. They just weren't very intersting and in a movie the characters have to be interesting in order for the audience to care about them. In my opinion, people are praising this movie more for it's ground breaking theme (rightfully so, I must say) than for the actual content. If these two characters where a ""normal"" couple I believe that the movie would be considered run of the mill if not plain bad. I just wanted more character development.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A8UR2VZV6C0XF	Rainbowman	"As I've read down through the numerous reviews on this movie, I have encountered a few (precious few) reviews that had thoughtful criticisms.  And I've even found myself agreeing with some of them.  I do wish there had been more affection displayed between Jack and Ennis to support the idea of them being in love.  Though I will say the 2nd tent scene, when Ennis gets up and goes into Jack was pretty tender and loving.  Still, the complaint is a valid criticism.But nearly all of the rest of the negative reviews, in my opinion, are not valid.  Too many have tried comparing the story with one about a man and a woman, saying if it were about a man and a woman, nobody would care about it.  Granted, they wouldn't.  But if a man loved a woman in 1962, it wouldn't have been a big deal, would it?  There would be no threat to their lives.  Can you see that a fair comparison isn't possible?  Can you admit that it's not?Can you understand that it is this vital difference that makes the movie important?Another viewer claims there was anal rape, which is just idiotic.  This poor individual has no clue what rape means, and as a result, I doubt many will consider his review helpful. For even those who didn't like the movie would know that rape was not a part of it.Another said Gyllenhaal and Ledger's characters in the movie just wanted sex, didn't matter from who.  Is that really fair?  Gyllenhaal's character wanted to be with Ennis, who was too afraid.  And only from neglect did Jack turn to other men.  Similarly, Ennis only was intimate with his wife, and Jack.  He later took up with a waitress, but she lassoed him.  Do you think if he was so afraid of being found out he was gay, that he would dare reject her efforts?  What might that indicate about him to others?  Yet, when she finally said goodbye, you didn't see him trying to talk her out of it.  All he said was, ""Well I was probably no fun anyhow."" He seemed relieved.  He had an image he felt he had to uphold for his own safety.  It doesn't mean he wanted sex, no matter who it was from.  Painting these guys as promiscuous users is totally unfair to their characters, and the realities each dealt with.Then we had those few nasty reviews that labeled the movie, ""decadent, liberal scum,"" ""liberal social propaganda,"" and ""liberal fluff.""  In making the charge that this movie had an agenda (and by using the language they used), the reviewers only showed that they themselves have an agenda.  And it's not a very nice one.  Basically, any portrayal of gay people as happy, or loving, or human, or broken, or anything other than sick, is considered propaganda to these folks.  Well my friends, we do have happiness in our lives, and we do love, and we are often broken (just as you are), and sometimes more broken because of your cruelty.  Portraying our lives accurately and fairly is not some `liberal fluff.'  I feel really bad for those of you who cannot stand to see any honest portrayal of gay characters.  You're really going to have a hard time of it during the coming years when gay marriage, and ENDA, and other measures pass, assuring us the rights we are guaranteed by our constitution.  And they will pass.Next in the lexicon of irrational statements is that this movie is the product of a liberal Hollywood obsessed with politics.  Actually, the story was authored by a native writer in Wyoming who is not part of Hollywood.  One reviewer claimed that ""Once again, Hollywood is beating down our morals.""  No, the movie is challenging you to see more than the black and white of this situation, but it apparently was not possible in your case.Then we have what at first seems to be a fair and accurate criticism... that they cheated on their wives, and destroyed their families.  A really good review was posted on February 9th by ""Billy Bob.""  The wives were the victims of homophobia, just as the husbands were.  All you straight guys, close your eyes and imagine that you live on a planet where the majority was homosexual.  Anyone with attractions to women were considered inferior and a spiritual abomination.  Realize that if you are found out, it could cost you your life, or at least a lot of harassment.  So you marry a man because it is expected of you.  Are you going to tell me that if you met a woman who came onto you in the mountains that your nature wouldn't express itself?  That you wouldn't get away as often as possible to be with her?  If you think you wouldn't, you're not being honest - or fair. Your husband would be a victim then, just as Alma and Lureen were victims.  And you would be a victim of that prejudice too, just as Jack and Ennis were in this movie.Neither man shirked his responsibilities to his children, as some have claimed.  As poor as Ennis was, he refused to get together with Jack that last August because he had to work to pay his child support.  Those who said they abandoned their children need to watch the movie again.One person wondered if it had been a man and a woman, if ""all this deception and cheating would be as overlooked as it is here?""  Please watch ""Bridges of Madison County,"" with Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood.  Or, just about any movie with romance as the theme.  Deception and cheating are what sells movies..The same person who declared Hollywood is beating down our morals (wait!  didn't Hollywood make `The Passion of the Christ?), also said, ""Come on!  Gay cowboys?""  LOL.  Ah yeah...  We are fully represented in all lifestyles available..  there are also gay doctors, gay lawyers, gay teachers, gay politicians, and on and on and on.....  And God help us all, there are even gay conservatives.""It's a movie about cheating on your spouse, regardless of the time period it's placed in.""No, it's a movie about two men who fell in love unexpectedly, and never would have had spouses if they had the freedom to be what they were.One misguided individual even tells those of us who liked the film to `wake up.'  Apparently we aren't aware the silly critics are `blowing smoke up this film's ass.'  Then he tells us to `think for ourselves.'  Gee, I thought I was.  I'll bet most everyone who posted one way or the other thought for themselves, except maybe those with an agenda (who maybe had their opinions tainted by the Jerry Farwell's and Pat Robertson`s of the world).  Do you really think that your views are so right that you have to tell everyone else to wake up and agree with you?""All I could think of the whole time was how terrible they were. People think they were being `brave`, but in reality it doesn't matter that they were gay and in love - because they were destroying other people's lives and it's not fair or noble in any way.""  Could they have been faithful and noble if they had been allowed to be together?  Could they have experienced their nature in a noble way if society treated homosexuals in a noble way?Someone claimed John Wayne must be rolling over in his grave.  I doubt John Wayne would be too shocked by it.  He undoubtedly knew gay men, and probably gay cowboys.  But if he were so shocked about it that he'd roll over in his grave, then let him roll.  Those of us who are gay are under no obligation to hide in a closet so that he or anyone else can be at ease in their prejudice.Okay.....I've responded to all the remarks that I felt needed responding to.As for the Oscars?  I doubt Brokeback will win best film.  It surely should.  But my feeling is the politics ABOUT the movie will prevent it.  I hope I'm wrong."	5.0	A Review of the Reviews	2006-03-03	56	50	6

A friend and I watched this late at night and had to go to a 24-hour diner to ""recover."" It's not a movie I can watch over and over again -- it's just so heart wrenching -- but I own it. I own it because it's so real, the same reason I own Gibson's ""We Were Soldiers."" It makes me cry a lot, but it's an ""OmigodWOW-thatsreallybeautifulandsad"" kind of crying.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A12QS9I00B8EKI	Raspberry	"As someone who has seen many movies in the last few weeks, I can say without a doubt that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is one of the best films to come out this holiday season. Heath Ledger does an amazing job, but so do Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, and all of the other actors who aren't getting quite as much buzz. The story is about two cowboys, Ennis and Jack, who fall in love while working together one summer. Because of the time period and where they live, they can't be together. What I found very sad while watching the movie is the realization that while society was even less accepting towards gay couples several decades ago, society still has a long way to go today. I would encourage everyone to go see this film, although unfortunately the bigoted people who most need to see it probably won't. Having read the short story that this movie is based on, I think the filmmakers did a really good job in adapting it. I would also recommend the short story, which I think adds even more depth to the movie whether read before seeing it or afterwards. My only complaint about the movie is that certain sections went on a little too long. One of the main plot points is that Ennis and Jack often get together under the guise of going on fishing trips, and I think that those scenes dragged on a little. However, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a well-acted and incredibly moving film."	5.0	Very powerful	2006-01-04	18	15	3

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A23I6PFD9X6Y5D	Raymond K. Wong	"As I type these words, Brokeback Mountain just won four Golden Globe awards including Best Drama. It's no surprise to a lot of people, even though the film itself was every bit a surprise.Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal), both 19 years old, are two poor ranch hands from Riverton, Wyoming. They meet one summer while seeking jobs, and Joe Aguirre (Quaid) hires them to herd sheep up in Brokeback Mountain.Ennis is a taciturn, reserved and shy man. Jack is a charmer, a dreamer, a risk-taker. Their difficult childhoods and shared interests quickly secure a bond between them. Then one cold night, their budding friendship turns into something else: a drunken, violent sexual encounter. The next day, neither of them speaks of the incident, until Ennis tells Jack, ""What happened was a one shot deal. I ain't queer."" Jack replies, ""Me neither.""When the summer is over, Ennis and Jack go their separate ways. Ennis marries his sweetheart Elma (Williams) and they raise two daughters. Jack marries wealthy girl Lureen (Hathaway) and has a son. Everything is normal until, after four long years, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack. Something deep inside stirs up a hornet's nest. Their reunion becomes the beginning of a 20-year secret affair. Brokeback Mountain becomes their refuge from the world to which they don't belong.Ledger (Casanova) is extraordinary with his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar, a man who has few words in his vocabulary, a man so repressed that he doesn't know how to express himself or go for what he wants. Ledger reveals so much about his characters, often without saying a word. His mannerism and facial expression speak volume. He's transformed himself realistically into a man that is so unlike the actor himself, who has mostly been known for his fluffy, light performances in the past. In contrast, Gyllenhaal (Proof) has the more lively role. His Jack Twist is the opposite of Ennis in almost every way. Jack's longing for the man he loves is evident in Gyllenhaal's stellar performance. The men also share immense chemistry together. You believe they're real. You believe their feelings for each other are real.While one can argue that it's a character study of two men and their relationship, the women in the story add an immense appeal to the film. Williams (The Station Agent) is amazing with her heartbreaking performance as Ennis's long-suffering wife Alma. When she witnesses something about her husband that she doesn't fully understand, her reaction is incredibly real and painful to watch. Hathaway (Havoc) has a relatively minor role as Jack's indifferent wife Lureen. But her final scene is mesmerizing - Hathaway has matured into a fine actress.Brokeback Mountain unfolds slowly and, under the direction of Lee (Hulk), the pacing is deliberate and leisurely. At more than two hours, the film feels slow sometimes, but it is far from being boring. While the plot is simplistic, the acting is exceptional and there is so much going on at the thematic and emotional levels that one can't help but feel spellbound by the story.The script by awarding-winning writers McMurtry (Terms of Endearment) and Ossana (Dead Man's Walk) expands Proulx's short story into a languid character study that holds on to your heart and doesn't let go. The dialogue is real and to the point - nothing too poetic or out of character. Mostly episodic, there are many fine moments in the film that are emotionally raw and powerful. The ending will haunt you.Lee's direction is masterful, and it clearly demonstrates his versatility as a director. It's even more impressive when you consider Lee's heritage as a Chinese immigrant, and how he so deftly captures Americana in Brokeback Mountains. The cinematography by Rodgrigo Prieto (21 Grams) is breathtaking. The editing is crisp. Gustavo Santaolalla's (Motorcycle Diaries) score is subdue but poignant.Some say this is a ""gay cowboy"" movie. I say this is a story about love and betrayal and life. Homosexuality is only part of it - the heterosexual aspects of the story are just as strong. If you have ever loved and lost before, you will feel the impact of this story. The film is like fine wine - it delicately lingers on your palate and seeps into your vein. Brokeback Mountain is destined to become an American classic."	5.0	Masterful directio, spellbinding performance, haunting story	2006-01-20	29	27	2

Bayerl ""Specialist in having fun"""	With all of the Oscar buzz surrounding this movie, I figured I should take it in, so as to be better prepared for water cooler conversation.  But nothing in it really strikes me as great, even with its novelty of subject matter.  To me, the two of them just don't appear to have enough chemistry for the kind of stuff we see early on between them.  It runs a little long, too--I was looking at my watch after the 50-minute point, and on through to the end.  Maybe I'm supposed to be convinced that a pair of commonly-situated buddies has a full and natural potential for finding romance of the kind not seen among the straight.  I'm sure there was a message relating to the central topic, like they should have married each other from the outset (if only it were legal).  But I was not personally moved.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AFJFXN42RZ3G2	"R. DelParto ""Rose2"""	"The sight of nature's landscape shows that undisturbed country exists.  Brokeback Mountain is the film shows this example.  Indeed, the landscape speaks to the viewer that this is God's country, which is untouched and uncontaminated.  The film differentiates between natural landscape and one that is defined outside of human nature.  The characters of Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) blend with the natural landscape where there are little or no boundaries except the boundaries they create between themselves.  However, once they leave the backcountry, they have to live with society's boundaries.Brokeback Mountain is worthy of any high accolades because it follows in the similar footsteps as other legendary Hollywood films that possess epic qualities.  John Huston could have made this film, and John Steinbeck could have written the narrative.  But Ang Lee directed, Larry McMurtry, Diana Ossana wrote the screenplay adaption from E. Annie Proulux's narrative. It appears that most of the controversies in society tend to be overlooked in the heartland where the film takes place, Wyoming and Texas, but Hollywood tends to use the heartland as a backdrop to macro impose a difficult issue in order to see the big picture.  In this case, sexual orientation is depicted with its historical complexities that existed from the 1960s to the 1980s.The film's photography and soundtrack is effective throughout the film.  Rodrigo Prieto should be commended for the exceptional pictureresque mountainous scenes that took place at Brokeback Mountain, and Gustavo Santaolalla's score for the film.  The soundtrack is one to be considered for future listening.  The main themes as well as the piece ""Snow"" shows the tranquility of each scene in which it is played (the opening chords and melody plays similar to The Beatles' ""Blackbird"").Disregard controversy and preconceived perceptions.  The main premise of Brokeback Mountain involves requited love and the relationship between two people that spans twenty years.  This is what makes the film, and the reason why it is highly recommendable."	5.0	The Way Movies Should Be Made	2006-02-26	19	12	7

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A39NMTBYW9E3Y7	Red	I really was moved by Brokeback Mountain. It is a sad and often touching film, that should be seen at least once by anyone interested in cinema. The direction by Ang Lee is flawless in almost every frame.I was angered by the film for not giving a clear explaination for one of the character's death. I now feel differently. It is best for the viewer to think what they want about it. It was the death itself and how it affected the other characters that was important in the film. The death itself will affect the viewer, and Del Mar's reaction to it is heartbreaking.Some reviews mention the makeup, cloths and other superficial aspects of the film. They are not important to enjoying the film.The acting, direction and story are why the film should be seen and even studied.A student will find writing a thesis on the story, the film or book a great challenge. There are things in the film, subtle things, that get missed during one viewing. If you want to know what I am talking about, see the film again. Look closly at every scene; take it all in. I have not yet read the book.Brokeback Mountain is a wonderfully sad and disturbing film. It may have it's amusing moments, they are few. This film is about love, lust and life. Live's without committment, where lies do more damage than aweful truths.	4.0	"""We'll always have Brokeback Mountain"""	2006-03-04	19	14	5

Ledger gives the performance of his life, conveying denial, rage, grief and yearning so convincingly, at times by only using his eyes. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack, soulfully expresses the hunger and determination to live a contented life with Ennis. Jack unapologetically gives his heart and wears it on his sleeve.

But instead of pointing back at all the positive reviewer's comment to demonstrate his integrity, let's go right into his test.Do we want to watch Brokeback Mountain over 3 times. The answer is Yes. In fact, my family, and friends, and just about everyone I know watched this movie at least 5 times in theatre, and have all bought the DVD release. On the other hand, Crash, though won the award, did not generate the same feeling. In fact, I was ready to pack the movie and ditch it within 30 minutes. The movie talks about contraversy in racism, but where's the depth, the emotional connection, the spiritual value? All it does is repeat the American wave of racism over and over again.If you have not already done so, go to the store, and buy this movie. This is absolutely the best movie you will ever see, as long as you are smart and have depth. Nevermind what shallow people like Plom de Nume say about this movie.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A4JP4T1F95D0A	RG69	This was the first movie I have watched that is a genuine love story between 2 men.  There was only 1 sex scene and a few kissing scenes.  So anyone who might be turned off by reports of this being all about 2 men making out can give this movie a try.  The story, set in 1963 Wyoming is more a character study about 2 men who fall in love with each other.  Ennis and Jack share something special, but they can never reveal it to the world or even let on.  This is 1963 and the heart of middle America, and you don't dare come out of the closet.  The two men spend the next 20 years trying to spend some time together out in the seclusion of the mountains, while trying to maintain the appearance of normal heterosexual lives with wives and children.  It is a very good look at forbidden love.  Well acted all the way around, with an interesting story.  2 parts kept this from being 5 stars from me.  The first is the sexual encounter between the men.  To me it just happened all of a sudden.  I would have enjoyed more of a buildup.  The second is Jack's parents, who hinted at knowing that he was gay.  I would have liked to seen more of his relationship with them, or given a more clear understanding of what they knew.  Other than that, this was well crafted and worth a watch.	4.0	First	2006-04-10	14	11	3

It took me a few days to contemplate the remarkable film, and I can only say the it's the biggest feather in Ang Lee's hat. Mr. Lee's sensitivity never ceases to amaze me, from the hysterically funny ""The Wedding Banquet"" (another gay-themed film), or ""Sense & Sensibility"" (Jane Austen as imagined by an Asian? Who would've thought...?), ""The Ice Storm"" (dysfunctional families abound, with great sensitivity), and, of course, ""Couching Tiger..."" Ang Lee's mastering of such diverse subjects, with amazing skill, must certainy rank him at the very top of our living directors. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is rife with style & focus. The beauty of the scenery is in direct contrast with the initial conflict. The gentlemen go off to their mundane destinies, which can, in no way, match the beauty of the environment of the mountain. I can't get certain images out of my head. Heath Ledger is absolutely amazing; I challenge anyone, male or female, straight or gay, not to shed a tear when, at the end, he finds the shirt in Jack's closet and holds it close. I'm glad that Mr. Ledger had this opportunity to legitimize the acting prowess that was so well presented in ""The Patriot"". All of the acting is, without exception, letter perfect. I still think that Jake Gyllenhaal had the toughest role, and his affection for Ennis was never in doubt. I especially liked the scene where he stood up to his big-shot father-in-law. His range of emotion was far more vast than what was expected from Ennis' character. The beautifully written script hit all the right nerves. This is NOT a gay movie; it's a film that presents an element of life, anyone's life, that under the right circumstances, could affect each and every one of us. A very sad, frustrating, brilliant film; I hope it wins many Oscars, especially Picture, Lee & Gyllenhaal. Love this film!  UPDATE: The double-disc DVD is loaded with stuff and worth the investment.

Artsy-fartsy stuff bores me, and I'd rather go to the dentist than watch ""the classics"".But Brokeback Mountain was different for me.  Yeah, it was slow at times.  The sheep go up the mountain.  The sheep come down the mountain.  But it wasn't the scenery or ""subtle nuances"".  The words Jack and Ennis said could have come from my own mouth.  I can't explain how it feels to watch a movie where you feel like someone you don't even know is telling your story.  As for those who say Ennis' character wasn't real or well-developed, I beg to differ.  As someone who grew up gay and terrified in a rural area where you know that ""if this thing"" comes over you at the wrong time and in the wrong place, you could wind up dead, it was pretty authentic to me.  The way he hated himself and tried to shut himself down to stay in control, his constant fear of discovery, his shame, and his concern that people were looking at him funny-- to close off from life so tightly that even speaking is a painful act.  It's not just the 60's....is there a rural born gay man alive who didn't hear about Matthew Shephard being beaten to death and think ""It could have been me...""?I thought the movie was beautiful and it makes me ache inside.  And even though I find it pretty depressing, somehow, it gives me hope.  Love can catch you by surprise when you're looking in the other direction.

The movie scenery alone was worth the trip.  I haven't seen a mountain that beautiful since Julie Andrews sang to the hills in Austria...Folks, I loved the movie, but I am sick to death of hearing people assure the homophobic public that this ""really isn't a gay love story.""  The hell it ain't.  That's exactly what it is.  The movie portrays that love to be as genuine, as special, and as fulfilling as the love between straight people; a portrayal long overdue.  We also read from many, that it portrays love that cuts across gender lines.  OK.  But let's not shy away from identifying the love being portrayed.  It is a love story between two gay men (even if they can't identify themselves as gay).  It is not a gay-cowboy movie..  they herded sheep for one summer of the 20 years spanning the film.  Just two men who loved each other more than their wives,,, more than anyone else..At the end of the film I felt depressed.  On the ride back to Long Island, I wondered why a movie was affecting me that way.  I mean, it was sad how it ended, but why was I so personally affected by it?  And I think the the lost opportunities portrayed in the film represent the lost opportunities so many of us who are gay have suffered due to homophobia.  Maybe not just romance, but opportunities that were denied to us because of the prejudice, and how tragic that has been.It was a great movie all around."	5.0	It IS a gay love story	2005-12-18	30	25	5

I find this movie hitting closer to home than other love stories because this could pass as an sincere true event.  One, Ennis,  is fearful of the public finding out, thus wants all to remain a secret. The other, Jack, ignoring what the times approved of.  It was acted very well and with Gustavo Santaolalla's compositions accompany the movie very well. I only have one beef with the film. We know how hard translating a book onto the big screen can be.  Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter just to name a few omited alot of things, yet Mortal Kombat Annihilation tried to fit everything (e.g. introducing a charater or two, then they never return, or naming a few characters that never are seen) in to cover all.  Either way, the end result can be better, or worse.  In brokeback mountain, that only true sex scene between Ennis and Jack was a little too "" in your face"".  I think it would be more accepting to have just left it to the viewers what they did in the tent, instead of throwing in  2 minutes of what was shown.  Other than that, i liked the movie greatly."	5.0	Great Film	2006-01-18	12	5	7

I can only tell you how the movie affected me.I grew up watching Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Hopalong Cassidy, and all the other classic western stars, so the idea of watching a film about two cowboys in love with each other just did not seem to be a road I wanted to travel. It didn't feel right; especially as I was born into a time when same sex relationships were really looked down on. Or not acknowledged. But the script was by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, Ang Lee was the director, Heath Ledger has become a very interesting actor, and the rest of the cast was fine. So I picked up a copy of the film.No matter how you try to adapt and rethink your position as you age in a changing world those old devil hang-ups and prejudices sneak up on you. It took me three days to watch the first half of the film. Other than some nice scenery and a surprisingly good score it was very difficult to watch the growing bond between these two men. The first half only lays the groundwork for the second half of the movie and that is where you will see why all the acclaim and awards. I couldn't stop watching.After a long introduction of the characters the second half begins to show them as people with a problem - and it was a problem for who they were and in that time - and how they dealt with it. The first half is necessary, but it is the second half that shines. If you have an ounce of soul you will feel the pain and the love as it builds to a final fifteen minutes that is as good as filmmaking gets. It will squeeze your heart.	5.0	Unexpected	2006-04-17	51	43	8

There's hundreds of gut wrenching, and promising true life stories on the ""Brokeback Mountain"" website. This is a story that needed to be told. It's not just a ""Gay"" deal, it's what happens in the real world. I really believe this film will open quite a few eyes. It really sucks being in a situation like these guys, even in 2005. I should know I am in one right now.""The land of the free, and the home of the brave"". It seems to me, alot of us are brave enough to be who we really are. We just long to be free like everyone else, that knows what true love really means.  As free as some other countries who are recognizing the true love between people of the same sex. We don't have to be a stereotypical gay man or woman as TV sitcomes, and films so far have portrayed, we are everywhere. I knew it was going to take some time, but I've always thought we lived in a country that always takes the ""Bull by the Horns"", and shows everyone else in this world what freedom is all about. I guess we'll have to see what happens in the next few months when it opens up in major theatres. I'm thinking very positive about this film.

Sure, the simple minded would be bored by this movie since nothing about this movie suggest a Pop or Rock nature that young people today seem to degrade themselves to. Still, this movie shows true emotion, master craftmanship, and dedication which Crash, though well intentioned, cannot match!

Carlson ""movie critic"""	I do not like to use the word gay in reference to this movie, as the stereotypical connotation of gay does not fit these men. One definitely has to understand, or at least be sensitive to the homosexual psyche to like this film. First off, the respective roles that each character plays in the relationship has to be understood. Jack is the aggressor who starts the sexual relationship by successfully seducing Ennis. If Jack hadn't made any moves on Ennis, nothing would have happened and it would have been just an ordinary sheep herding job. Why did Ennis accept the seduction?Jack was impulsive and didn't think about the social consequences of homosexual relationships at the time and place. Ennis, on the other hand was always fully cognizant of the forbidden nature of his friendship with Jack and was never as comfortable with it as Jack was. I had the feeling at times that this was a one way relationship, driven by Jack. Jack was direct about what he wanted out of the relationship, but Ennis was conflicted and leery of spending too much time away from home with Jack.The attitude these men had toward their wives was atrocious, but I think that this was somewhat typical of the way women were treated by many men in the rural west of the time.In the end, Jack's dream of  living and ranching with Ennis was never fulfilled. Of course not. This kind of love story obviously has to end in tragedy.During the times with their families, Ennis remains faithful to his wife, but Jack does not. Jack had a much greater libido regarding sex with other men. Whereas Ennis just liked Jack and went no further for same sex encounters.One could try to analyze just HOW homosexual each character is, but that would be a waste of time. This is a mystery which no one will ever figure out.This was a very accurate portrayal of married men who have a homosexual side, in the present as well as in past decades.I did not want to like this movie, but all my preconceptions about this just being a politically correct film were shattered as soon as the dialog started.This was the first time in my life a movie had ever made me cry.	5.0	Passionate.....	2006-04-06	21	17	4
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3ICHEO78NFE4Y	Rick D. Barszcz	"Basically all i hear about this film was it was about gay cowboys and highly political with somekind of agenda attached to it.  Anyone in the media who has said those words could not have ever experienced true love.  For this film was nothing but pure beauty and a kind of love that no one could ever come between.I was brought up in the 60's and i'm sure each of us on some level in that era has a ""Broke Back Mountain"" story that we've experienced.  I seem to have related more to Jake.  I had worked in the theatre world pretty much all my life where things were more open in gay life.  I also lived on a farm in Connecticut and the boy i was in love with, a few years younger than i, was more like Heath.  It was a termendious flash back of bailing hay, boy wrestling in the barn, hot sweaty sex and extreme love.  We ended up parting ways because of careers and i thought about him last night and prayed that he is doing ok.I now have a partner of many many years and i'm in my middle 50's.  Are love and bond is extremely tight.  We can't live together anymore because we both have sickly parents that we attend to but we do have a home that we go to on weekends providing no disasters with our parents.  If there was any way we could have gotten closer than we all ready are, this film did it.  It was like being with him for the very first time last night after watching this film.  What closeness and the feeling of being ""one"" that we experienced.  Again, Love.What i'm trying to put accross is, it doesn't matter if your straight or gay.  This film speaks to all of us that believe in true and everylasting love.  My hat off to the great director and to the two wonderful actors of Heath and Jake for the most convincing roll of two men so in love that you could feel each others happyness and pain.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3KV2V9XR7OZ6D	Rick Mosher	"After all the hype about this movie I guess I set my expectations too high. I was expecting ""an epic love story"" like the trailers and reviews tout it to be. I don't remember anywhere in the entire film the word ""love"" being mentioned. Ennis and Jack certainly never said it... to each other or to their wives or their kids. I was expecting to watch these two guys unexpectedly fall madly, head over heels, kick up your boots, thank your lucky stars in love with each other. What I ended up watching was two drunks get it on `cuz they were horny and didn't have anything else to do between shootin' coyotes and tacklin' sheep. Then they spend the rest of their miserable lives cheating on their wives, abandoning their kids, and arguing about why they should or shouldn't make a life together. Undoubtedly the sense of longing to be together was conveyed, but for what? Love? Sorry, none to be had here.The only redeeming quality of this film is that the scenery is stunning; however, the acting was average. I never felt emotionally attached to anyone except Michelle Williams's character, Alma. My personal opinion is, if you think you might be gay; don't expect getting married to a woman to fix it. You simply ruin your life, her life and the lives any kids that are created in the process. I left the theater with an extreme sense of emptiness.I had hoped that somewhere in this wretched mess that someone would end up with a scrap of happiness. However, the best they could do was to have Alma Jr. to get her daddy to come to her wedding. So much for resolution.I was told by a friend, ""Life doesn't always have a happy ending...""

Ever since I watched it the first time I just haven`t been able to put it out of my mind (or my heart). The story and the people in it are just so much more than fiction! Somehow Ennis and Jack, as well as the other characters, are just as complex as ""real"" people. I guess that`s why this film has touched so many people!I never seen such passion in a movie before, and certainly not between two men! Heath and Jake are just perfect as Ennis and Jack!! Ennis and Jack are really ""made"" for eachother, they have so much in common - and yet the are eachothers opposites  in many ways. Ennis is the silent type - Jack is the talkative, Ennis is down to earth - Jack is a dreamer and so on...Both are bisexual but unfortunately Ennis is much less so than Jack. Ennis`incapability to recognize (in his mind) himself as even a little bit ""queer"" stops him from fully accept that Jack is the one for him.Here is the tragedy of this film! Ennis refuses to go with what his heart tells him, he is just too afraid to be ""not normal"". Stubbornly he tries to go on with a ""normal"" family life after parting from Jack (after their first summer together). Ennis double life is heavy on him and makes him unhappy. Jack, one the other hand, is hurt by Ennis refusal to live with him.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3OJ012QPTGMLR	R. J MOSS	There is an argument that short stories adapt to the screen better than novels. Maybe it gives more space for invention. I'm thinking of the two 'Mountain' movies and how leaden the translation of,'Cold Mountain' was compared to this superlative work.Both were based on fictions by writers I admire, though,'Brokeback' never suggested movie treatment to me, or even stood out in Proulx's,'Close Range' collection. But this is to possibly slight Ang Lee whose work is consistently more subtle and extensive than Menghalis's. For one thing, the mountain itself has a prominent and passionate place in Lee's telling.The curdling movement of the sheep flocks over the rugged terrain are suggestive of the swelling undercurrents of feeling that break between the two shepherds during their few months of exposure on the mountain. Ledger comes of age in this movie; brooding and slouched, angling a convincing mid-western drawl from one corner of his mouth with the repressed passion of a pit bull. Again, Lee's genius is to be applauded for how he's maximised Ledger's limitations.The women get the rough end of the stick (no pun intended)and the Amazon reviewer is spot on about McMurtry's hand in all of this as there is a pervading ambience of his,'Last Picture Show'.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3GB6RKLASF9HB	"R. Kearns-White ""rockiw"""	"Brokeback Mountain, so the media said, was the most gut-wrenching love story of the year. But, where was the love? Jack (played Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis (played by Heath Ledger) seemed more like really good buddies, who just happened to have sex with each other because there were no women around. They horsed around (no pun intended), drank, fought, and shot the s***. Even when they did appear to share their emotions, neither one ever uttered the word ""love."" The closest the audience comes to seeing that they are truly in love is when Ennis becomes jealous of Jack's gay dalliances in Mexico. Only love or hate can inspire such a strong emotion as jealousy, and from their years of being sex buddies we know that they didn't hate each other.All in all, Brokeback Mountain was a solid, good movie. Heath Ledger was perfect as Ennis-the tight-lipped and emotionally congested cowboy. The only time he ever let his guard down or succumbed to the niceties of people was when he was with Jack. (He allowed Jack to tenderly caress him, and found rest by snuggling in his arms.) The only emotion he ever let himself show in public was violence. I got the sense that when he got into fights with other men he was really trying to beat up himself. For that performance, Heath Ledger deserved all the accolades he received and may have even been jerked by the Academy for an Oscar. (Michelle Williams and Jake Gyllenhaal also turned in Oscar-worthy performances.)Jake Gyllenhaal used his lanky frame and doe-eyes to his best advantage as the bull rider with the fantastical dreams of domestic bliss with Ennis. From the first time Jack reached out to Ennis, you knew that it was over for him. Jack turned him out, but it was Ennis who held the power in the relationship by being the emotional recluse-forcing Jack to always reach out for him. Jack was as starved for emotional reciprocation as Ennis' long-suffering wife, Alma. Jack and Alma were constantly waiting for Ennis to say the there magic words that they, themselves, were afraid to say in case they didn't get the answer they wanted. His presence, as Alma learned the hard way, was not a guarantee of his love.Again, I ask, where was the love? It was deep down somewhere in Ennis, where even Ennis was unable to touch and that was the biggest flaw of Brokeback Mountain.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ACAV6HZSJGUR1	R. MacTaggart	"I heard about Brokeback for six months.  From all the hype, I anticipated a sweeping love story between two cowboys.  I anticipated scenes of highly charged but tastefully photographed lovemaking between two men.That's not what I finally saw.  I watched an unsatisfying tale of tormented love between two men who meet for twenty years and usually bicker like an old, married, straight couple.  The controversial sex scenes?  But one, and it is a fully-clothed scene more akin to rape than an expression of love.  It was as painful to watch as it would be to experience.In short, Brokeback continues a theme long advanced by Hollywood: Queers cannot be happy; queers cannot have good sex.  Have we not advanced an iota since the infamous Boys in the Band, which opened in 1970?The endlessly discussed Great Gay Love Story was actually the least interesting aspect of Brokeback.  Far more interesting is what should have been the central theme: Two men who don't fit into society.  You know, cowboys.  Repeat: cowboys.  Ennis and Jack are far more at home in the sweeping, breathtaking expanse of wild America than they are in their respective cramped city apartment and suburban home.  This tension is the best part of the movie.Also interesting is the complicated relationships between the men and their wives and families.  Ang Lee would have you believe that the impediment to Jack and Ennis finding happiness as married men was their sexual orientation.  Sorry, the impediment was largely their inability to connect with mainstream expectations.  The men were only happy on Brokeback and suffocated in other roles - cowboys first; queers second.Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance and he should have won the Academy Award.  He was wholly believable as an inarticulate cowboy.  A dazzling performance.Here's my version of Brokeback; it's about 95% the same.  What is different is that Ennis and Jack never have sex or express any kind of love even though they meet for twenty years on Brokeback.  Instead of bickering, each man finds peace in the wild - a break from the endless demands, frustrations, and disempowerment they experience in their city lives.Then Ennis discovers that his friend has died in...a car crash.  He doesn't know how to react.  He calls the widow who explains that Jack's family won't allow Jack's ashes to be scattered on Brokeback.  Ennis dutifully goes to the parents and the scene plays out almost - but not precisely - as Lee filmed it.  Jack's homophobic father offers exactly the same creepy speech but Ennis shifts uncomfortably.  He's confused and thinks: What is the old man insinuating?  Meanwhile, Jack's mother looks knowingly at Ennis - just as Lee filmed.  She then offers the perplexed man the opportunity of visiting Jack's bedroom.  Ennis goes upstairs and finds his old shirt encased in Jack's shirt; the camera has a close-up of his face as he slowly realizes: Jack loved me.  A few moments pass as Ennis's face contorts with the belated knowledge that he was in love with Jack as well.  He breaks down in heaving sobs.  As he departs the Twist home the scene plays out exactly as Lee filmed.  (Roberta Maxwell as Jack's mother also offers a dazzling performance.  Has ever so much been conveyed with so little?)When we later watch Ennis in his trailer (and after the lovely scene with his daughter), the story again plays out as Lee filmed except for the last scene.  Ennis opens the closet and reveals the Two Shirts.  As the camera stays on his back, we hear a door open.  A hand appears and massages Ennis's neck.  Then a stubble-covered face proffers a gentle kiss on the bare neck.  We then hear: ""It's OK to miss `em still, Ennis.""The two men look at each other.  Their eyes are radiant with love.  They kiss.Fade to black.Happy at last."	3.0	A Different Brokeback?	2006-04-10	44	4	40
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AX3WJZLFQQRCT	"R. M. Ettinger ""rme1963"""	A good story and acting should define a movie, especially in the category of drama. Unfortunately, what ruled (and ruled out) this movie for many were labels attached to its release. The key was to look beyond those labels to be able to see a good movie.`Brokeback Mountain' is a very good movie when broken down to its talents:  story, script, directing, acting, cinematography and music.  I have almost no disagreement w/any of those subsets.In short - this is a story first and foremost about love. It's not a gay love story, but one of how love can go unfulfilled - and again, not with only the male leads in this movie. The fleshed-out script that was executed flawlessly.  Lee's directing was dead-on and the Oscar was well deserved.  As mentioned in numerous other reviews - the scenery, cinematography and music really set the stage for the overall look and feel of the movie.The reason the movie gets 4 stars for me was the acting.  Sure Gyllenhaal did a good job, but he didn't do a great job.  It was Ledger who shined.  I do think he was robbed of so many acting awards for this project.Ledger's character's pain at not being true to himself or the ones he loves (and I'm not just talking about `Jack') was palpable. His suppression of emotion is exactly what you'd expect from a character like that during a time/environment like that.  There were two scenes that got to me more than anything in the movies:  Ennis sobbing in an alley after coming off the mountain - and greeting Jack when he came for his first visit.  To me it was complete raw emotion and perfectly acted.I thought Williams did an excellent job in her role. It'd be nice to think she'll be known  more for this than something like `Dawson's Creek'.  Only Hathaway, playing Jack's wife, seemed miscast.  She wasn't as fluid an actress (or maybe it was the part) as the others. Trivial but everyone aged over those 20 years - and she looked like a 20 yo w/a succession of bad wigs. She was fine - just not to the caliber of the other actors.Do I think this is worth a purchase?  Yes.  I saw it in the theatre and purchased the DVD when it came out. If labels didn't apply - it'd be an instant classic	4.0	Love is Love	2006-04-21	19	6	13
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	RMurray847	"I am not going to belabor the plot of the movie.  It's been well-described elsewhere, and to a large extent, this is not a plot-driven movie.  It covers a lot of time, and its characters go through a lot...but to a greater extent it's a mood or tone piece...it's not about what happens, but how what happens changes the characters.First, let me touch on the good stuff.  The obvious place to heap praise is in the acting.  Heath Ledger (as Ennis)is very good...to me he got better as the film went along.  Just watch his posture.  He's not just aging, he's ""wearying.""  A load of sadness settles on him, only momentarily lifted when he's around his daughters...or the love of his life...Jake Glynenhaal (as Jack).  It's a performance that feels as lived in as the denim clothes he wears.  Michelle Williams is very sympathetic as his wife.  Randy Quaid, in a small role, is frankly quite riveting.  He's an actor with no ego about his appearance, and he plays that for excellent effect here.  Glynenhaal, to me, is the weakest link.  His Jack Twist is a slightly less full-bodied character.  He's always full of mischief and high-spirits...sometimes its hard to find anything below that.  It's there, and it comes out at times, but sometimes I felt the actor was coasting a little bit.  He's still quite good, but is not up to Ledger's performance, and not worthy of the Oscar-buzz.The cinematography is great.  The music is very good.  And the script from Larry McMurtry and Dianna Ossana is sparse and to the point.  You can tell it's McMurtry...so many stylings of dialogue hearken to LONESOME DOVE, LAST PICTURE SHOW, etc.  And the ending of the film is typical of McMurtry's refusal to give us any closure.  Don't come into the theatre expecting to know all you want to know about the characters when you leave 134 minutes later.  McMurtry refuses to write stories that way (even adaptations) and Ang Lee (the director) is clearly interested in other things too.To say this movie is about gay love, or about how hiding your true self causes anguish overly politicizes or oversimplifies it.  The characters and situations are FAR too specific and detailed to simply be generalized.  As the two characters grow in their relationships, we grow to care about them...but we also see clearly the damage they are doing to others around them...others they should care about.  Their love is dangerous, reckless and wrong...not wrong because it's immoral for two men to love each other...but wrong because it leaves a wake of dead and damaged souls.  It's no passing fancy...they have found the love of their lives with each other, and can only endulge for a few days a year.  Yet the very act of experiencing their love hurts others.  It's not just adultery...these two men are depriving their spouses of intimacy.  They leave those that care about them (such as their children) baffled and lonely.  It's a sad situation all around...and the universal truth one might draw from it is that if only these men had been able to spend their lives openly together without fear of consequence from society...so much heartache would have been spared...and who would it have harmed?  That's certainly a valid question, but to generalize the movie to such a global conclusion, in my mind, diminishes the power of the movie itself.  Put simply, just enjoy the movie on its own terms.Ironically, I believe this ""politization"" of the movie is why it has generated so much award buzz.  I think a lot of people believe by heaping critical awards on the film, they will drive home its message.  What they are doing, however, is forcing people to take sides.  If you don't like the movie...you must be against gay relationships or worse yet, you must be a homophobe.  You can't dislike the movie just because you don't like the film.  Much like disliking SCHINDLER'S LIST (although I can't imagine disliking it myself) would have branded you as anti-semetic.  The polarization actually keeps people away from the film, I believe.For me, this is a very good film...but not GREAT.  I mentioned already all the things I liked.  But in the end, the film left me unmoved.  I wasn't emotionally invested in it beyond a casual interest in seeing how things unfolded.  While I appreciate a movie with a leisurely pace...sometimes I felt the pace was just indulgent.  And the biggest flaw was the initial sexual encounter between the men.  Where did it come from?  These two men had become friendly, out on their lonely shepherding job, but suddenly (and I do mean suddenly) a lust we hadn't seen before bubbles up and is manifested in a fairly violent and fast encounter.  The next morning, it seems just as likely that these two guys would have grown further apart, not closer together.  They generated no romantic or sexual tension.  Later, this is not the case, as their need for each other is quite palpable (lots of scenes of grabbing each other by the thick, comfortable coats they wear), but I missed the early spark which might have made me invest more of my emotion into the film as well.I recommend the film for adults (particularly since it's going to grab up so many Oscars), but to my mind, better movies this year include CRASH, CAPOTE, KING KONG and even THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN."	4.0	Very good...but not quite the Oscar-frontrunner in my mind	2006-01-17	16	7	9
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1RUUD5VTQUBPM	Robbie Doyle	In the world we live in today, people have begun to let themselves grow out of their prejudice and restricted standard of living to become open, accepting people. There are, however, a few people who are not ready for the progress, and hence leave negative reviews about this movie.Brokeback Mountain is a fantastic movie about two men hopelessly in love in an oppressive time. This movie is a significant step towards a free world, but it alone is not enough. It would take a lot more masterpieces like these before everyone is ready to accept the movie, and the Oscar Board to nominated a movie featuring same-gender love. Bombing angry letters on review board is not going to do anyone any favor.Just mark that comment as inappropriate, and let it be done with that. There is no reason to lose your cool over a stupid comment.	5.0	People, don't lose your cool	2006-06-02	30	25	5

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"Brokeback Mountain (Ang Lee, 2005)When it comes to the hallowed halls of the overrated director, there are few names that inspire more impassioned defense from those who think he's the second coming of Jesus than Ang Lee. (In fact, off the top of my head, I can only think of two: Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick.) Did anyone really like The Ice Storm? Really? Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is considered great by Americans who've never seen a wire-fu film before, and even Lee's greatest defenders will concede that one must overlook The Hulk when putting together Lee's resume for the hall of fame induction ceremony.Then there's Larry McMurtry, the second huge mistake made by the powers that be who decided to make this film. There's a reason no original McMurtry screenplay has made it to the big screen since Falling from Grace thirteen years ago. While McMurtry's long-winded, lackadaisical style makes for arguably decent novels, it's hell on a screen. After all, think of how much had to be pared from Terms of Endearment, Lonesome Dove, or The Evening Star to whip them into shape for filming.All that said, both Lee and McMurtry have made a career-best film with Brokeback Mountain, which is a good movie-- a very good movie-- straining to become great. One thinks that had a truly great screenplay writer adapted this (say, Rafael Yglesias, or maybe David Peoples), and a director whose work actually lives up to the hype been behind the camera (say, Julian Schnabel, or maybe Marc Caro), it would have been one for the ages.As I'm sure everyone on the planet and their dead mothers are aware, Brokeback Mountain is a love story. The principals here are Ennis Del Mar (10 Things I Hate About You's teen heartthrob Heath Ledger all grown up) and Jack Twist (Bubble Boy's Jake Gyllenhaal), who meet one summer when hired to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain in what seems to be north central Wyoming-- in other words, as far from civilization as one can get in America and still actually be in America. During the months the two are up there, they develop a relationship that haunts them the rest of their lives. The two both end up married, Ennis to childhood sweetheart Alma (Dawson's Creek's Michelle Williams), Jack to rodeo queen Lureen Newsome (The Princess Diaries' Anne Hathaway, even more all-grown-up than Ledger); the movie tracks the twenty years after Jack and Ennis' first meeting in 1963.First, the good things about the film; Lee has actually learned how to handle a scene where characters are talking about sex without having his characters come off sounding like embarrassed preteens (one of The Ice Storm's great failings). All four of the principals turn in fine acting jobs. Heath Ledger not only gets an American accent right, but a Western drawl. Gyllenhaal can make anything (with the exception of The Day After Tomorrow) worth watching; he turned the utterly stupid Bubble Boy into comic genius, and took a script for what had hope only to be a mediocre teen flick, Donnie Darko, and made it into one of the best-loved cult films of the last decade. It's no surprise that he does well. Hathaway and Williams, on the other hand, are complete surprises. The cinematography, as is to be expected, is fantastic (one of the things I will remember about this movie for the rest of my life is the scene where they're first herding a river of sheep up the side of the mountain), and the story comes together well and stays together, for the most part, throughout.Were it that simple, this would be a great film. The flaws in it, however, are not to be overlooked. The film could have used a good editor; it's not that there are any scenes that need taken out wholesale, but trimming ten seconds here and twenty there in all the places it could have been done would have easily dropped the film under two hours, and made it a far better-paced affair. (The one scene that could have been removed entire was the final scene; Ennis driving back across the same road he'd hitched a ride up in the movie's opening shot was an obvious place for someone to say roll end credits."" No one ever did.) At least one subplot vanishes into thin air just as it gets interesting (Jack's ongoing battle for dominance with his father-in-law). The makeup guys spent way too much time looking at pictures of Robert Redford before aging Heath Ledger for the second half of the movie-- but on the other hand, the aging makeup here is top-notch (certainly Oscar-worthy, ironic as makeup is one of the few categories in which the film wasn't nominated for an Oscar). The timeframe (by necessity, of course, but it still could have been done better) expands during the last half of the movie, and it gets overly choppy as it does. (It's not a question of confusion-- it's easy to keep track of where you are-- but of certain decisions on where to cut scenes and the like.) And some of the editing in the film makes me surprised it got off the ground. I'm willing to give the film's worst edit the benefit of the doubt-- the projectionist when I saw it might have screwed up changing reels, rather than a jump that bad actually being in the film-- but there were too many overly abrupt edits in the film for it to have been reel-changing every time.None of these things on its own is enough to drag a film down, probably, but added together, they speak to the ability and lack of experience (odd, in such an experienced group) of the crew who put this film together, and cannot be overlooked. Not, of course, that they haven't been by millions of fans. This movie has been lionized by the gay community in the same way the Christians lionized The Passion of the Christ last year. The difference, aside from the fact that it seemed to me that this film was supposed to come off ""a love story"" and not ""a gay love story,"" is that The Passion of the Christ was, technically, a perfect film, or as close to it as you can get. Brokeback Mountain is a good film, to be sure, but it's far from perfect. Still, it's a good film, and one worth seeing, especially for Jake Gyllenhaal fans. *** "	4.0	Where was the pudding?

Reading many different reviews I had decided in my head that it was going to be a feel good movie for a mature age gay man (me) to see. It was a month late opening at my local complex, and behind the excuses the truth appears to be 'due to the religeous lobby'. So yesterday I finally saw it. At first I was put off by the bleakness, but was swept up in the subtle layers, and had to remind myself, that this was the early 60's and it was uncannily accurate to my own experience.One cannot go into details without spoiling the experience for those yet to see it so in a nutshell, by the conclusion , I was in a state of devastation which is still with me a day later.Many small sequences are so fast ,it probably needs another viewing, but already my opinion is ,Ang Lee has touched the face of god, unlike the rednecks who will remain in ignorance for eternity. To those yet to see it, remember, we are all gods creations and he made us all for a purpose and those who judge in his name will answer to him.	5.0	devastating	2006-02-17	32	23	9
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1N3GNCJWXQ1ZP	"Robert Carnevali ""Typical, middle-aged guy"""	There really is so much to say about this movie, condensing it all into a short review is impossible. To put it as simply as possible, Brokeback Mountain is a work of art that slowly and almost subliminally works its way into your psyche, refusing to hint at or portray its message until the very end, at which point your emotions virtually devastate you.The storyline is pretty well-known now. Jack and Ennis, two 19-year-old ranch hands, are hired in the early 1960's to tend to a flock of sheep atop the grazing grounds of Brokeback Mountain in Montana. Jack, the son of an overly strict and distant father, is quick to make friends and laugh, while Ennis, an orphan raised by his brother and sister, is shy, withdrawn, and almost gun-shy of society. During the course of the summer, Jack gradually draws Ennis out of his shell and the two unexpectedly start a sexual relationship. At the end of summer, each goes their own way and start traditional families, but cannot deny the feelings they have for each other. They then maintain a 20-year romance through camping and fishing trips several times a year.The execution of this movie is near flawless! Cinematography is so beautiful at points, it's almost too much for the eyes to comprehend. The musical score is understated and feels perfectly at home within the film. Direction is near perfect. The film never loses focus of the two actors... from the opening scene to the end, this is a movie about them. Supporting characters are never dismissed, and though the attention is not focused on them, they are nonetheless memorable without ever stealing the scenes from the actors. The only drawback to the film is the makeup. The 2nd part of the film takes place over a span of 20 years, and shows the actors gradually aging from 19 to 39. The makeup isn't quite up to the job to make these young actors appear middle-aged and weathered. In all honesty though, I'm not sure any makeup anywhere can fully pull that off.As for the actors, Jake Gyllenhall and Heath Ledger played their roles beautifully. It quickly becomes apparent that the actors chose these parts not for the money, nor for any fame (it was never meant to be released as a major film), but rather because they believed in the story and wanted to portray their characters as best they could. Jake gives life to Jack in a refreshingly wonderful manner, and Heath disappears, leaving behind the withdrawn, shell-shocked Ennis.The movie progresses at a very slow pace. It's never boring, but throughout one wonders where the film is going and what it's trying to say. That sentiment continues to grow and almost threatens to lose you as an audience member until the last 20 minutes or so. At that point, the plot takes a sudden and surprisingly-devastating turn. It's surprisingly devastating because you simply don't expect to have made such an emotional connection with the characters, but found that you have. As the film reaches it's emotional impact, it becomes achingly apparent that it has woven itself under your skin and is now a part of you... it has its claws in you and is not letting go. As it climaxes, you're left with a rush of emotion that surprises you and that few films have ever been able to garner. It's at that point where you realize the purpose of everything previously in the film. The entire film is a leadup to one simple message, one simple premise. It's that gut-wrenching realization at the end that lingers in your mind long after you've walked away from the screen.The movie is honest. It documents and portrays. It makes no statement for or against homosexuality. It is unapologetic, yet compassionate. It's an all-time classic.	5.0	A work of art destined to be an all-time classic	2006-10-27	38	34	4

Even with a movie that I absolutely loved such as Broke Back Mountain, I really did not feel the motivation to write a review until after I see how many propaganda driven, lack of depth, shallow idiots wrote reviews for this movie, just so they can accomplish what politicians and church activist want ever since this movie received the recognitions and nominations they deserve.Broke back Mountain portrayed the universal truth about love, that ""Love Is Deepest When It Is Most Difficult."" The story starts off with two cowboys, both in desperate situations financially; both came from a less than perfect background. Then, they work in jobs without any support from their employers, and the only people that can comfort them are themselves. Anyone in this situation would fall in love, but their love extends way beyond that. Through the time they spend on Broke Back Mountain, characteristics that these two are destined lovers began to play out. For example, Jack's energetic spirit is the kind of energy needed to awake the comfort within Ennis, while Ennis's calm but firm spirit is the kind of caring nature Jack needs. They both share the same values, same thoughts, and if this were a girl-boy movie, as all the third rated movies Hollywood have made perhaps too much of due to a lack of extraordinary writer and director as talented as Annie Proulx and Ang Lee, then it would be easy to see that these two are suppose to be lovers. But why should the situation be any different when it comes to Two Men? It isn't any different, and finally, on a cold night on Broke Back Mountain, the two started the love that was already meant to happen.Deep inside Jack and Ennis, and perhaps every viewer of Broke Back Mountain, there is a realization that Jack and Ennis are meant to be together, instead of going seperately to wives because of the propaganda they are surrounded with. Yet, that is exactly what broke Jack and Ennis apart: Propaganda. These men would have been extraordinary together, but the propaganda that men should be with women force them into separate lives, and when Jack wants to escape this Propaganda, he is killed. Ennis lived on his own from that point on, and carried on this love for the rest of his life.Now ask yourself, are you viewing the core of this movie? Or are you judging this movie by the surface which, due to the same propaganda that kept Jack and Ennis apart, is a love that is not suppose to happen. All of you who think very lowly of this movie did it because you claim that these men are not in love. Yet you would say that the other Hollywood flicks, which is filled with people who just have sex on each other when they meet, and dump each others the next day, is true love. Some of you even claimed that this book portrayed that gay life is miserable, and this movie is about two miserable men seeking each other for sexual release. You are right, these men are miserable, but how can they not be when people like you are pressuring propaganda on them? Stop, and take the gender issue away for a moment. The qualities they show both themselves, and towards others, show a level of loving integrity that no other romance scenes from any other movie, gay or straight, has ever showed, and yet you refused to call it love. Let me ask you a question, if what they show is not love, then what is?If the displays of love and affection between these men do not come logical to you, it is because Ang Lee had to delete scenes from the original script so that narrow minded people like you won't be offended by it. If love between two men is the reason you don't like this movie, then perhaps it is time that you expand your horizon and be more accepting towards all forms of love, instead of expecting director Ang Lee to place a limit on love for you. If the misery you see is what displeases you, then let it be a lesson to you to create a more pleasant and accepting world for everyone so that these tragedies, which is still occurring in modern society, will never happen again. Finally, if you rated an movie that provokes new thoughts and emotions within the viewers, depths of understanding towards human nature, and a cry for a different way to live as 3 stars and below, then know that this is how you rate your integrity, as there is simply no reason to compromise true beauty towards your personal bias.Now let's look at this movie once again. Does this movie has a script that has depth, content, and provocative yet beautiful? Yes! Does this movie have a director that truly gets the inner beauty of the script, and enhances it while playing it out to the world? Yes! Does this movie has extraordinary actors and filmed with extraordinary theatrical skills? Yes! Does this movie that satisfied all criteria that define an once-in-a-lifetime, extraordinary movie, and even exceed all criteria and expectations and come out on top deserve an honor of the highest regard? Most definitely!In fact, Jack Nicholson, who announced the result for the best picture of the year, is the exact person that said that he refuses to watch a movie as single minded as Broke Back Mountain. Apparently he and the entire Oscar board decided that they can critic a movie without even laying an eye on it! But Broke Back Mountain is still chosen by the people, and received an extraordinary 8 nominations to Oscar. The same is true to all viewers of Broke Back Mountain. This movie deserves 5 stars if not more, and that's what needs to appear on the Amazon rating page.

Girard	"It is somewhat difficult to exercise objectivity with respect to a film which in 2005/06 accomplishes for the Gay Community (mine is San Francisco since 1977) what we had hoped ""Making Love"" would accomplish back in 1982, when it was released:  namely validate the inherent OKness of loving another man or woman (if you're a female).That said, it was also difficult to swallow the slap in the face by AMPAS at this year's Oscar telecast -- difficult, but not unexpected.  But even recognizing the generally conservative bent of the Hollywood community, it was nonetheless something of an insult that ""Brokeback Mountain"" was passed over in favor of the Los Angeles-based story of race and relationships.  And, it's not to say that ""Crash"" is not a good [even very good] film.  It's just to call attention to the fact that, at long last, there was a film released which addresses a multitude of rather significant issues:  1) The cost of homophobia -- both on men who love other men as well as the cost for a society held back from acceptance, understanding and compassion.  2) The price the individual pays by being very nearly thrust back in the closet of denial and lack of self-acceptance is enormous.  3) How very much more healthy it would be if we could live at ease with who we are and spend the time we have living life authentically and free from shame.  What a joy it would be to approach one another unapologetically -- to be the true me and share that with others, not so much in a sexual sense as in an inter-relationship sense.  At nearly 61, having lived in San Francisco since age 32, I wish I knew then what I know now.  What a waste to have reinvented myself several times in order to try to adopt a societally-acceptable shell to project to others.  What an incredible waste of energy and time that was.  And, also, what a waste of the one TRUE love of my life -- my ""Brokeback Mountain"" relationship, the man I should have been able to spend my life with, lost in 1980 at the start of the AIDS epidemic, not so much because of promiscuity (the story I fed myself at the time), but more as the result of MY inability to live authentically and not reimagine myself over and over in order to satisfy my idea of what was acceptable based on my background, level of education and class expectation.  4) It's taken me very nearly 30 years to come out of the fog of my created persona/e.  It would have been much more profitable to spend those years nurturing my relationship and my career rather than living a more piece-meal kind of existence.  5) This film points out many concepts regarding individual honor, societal acceptance and the price others around us pay when life is not able to be lived ""straight up"".  It is amazing that this brief (65-page) story could have generated all of these levels of interaction and discussion.  6) Kudos to Annie Proulx, Diana Ossana, Larry McMurtry, Ang Lee, Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, the entire cast and crew, as well as all other participants in the creation of an artistic masterwork -- both text and film.  7)  This is a movie (and story) which helped me to advance along my road of life in a more meaningful way.  I owe it a lot.  I hope we all will come to be in debt to it's vision, as well.--Robert GirardSan Francisco (4/3/06)"	5.0	Finally, art which validates lifestyle!	2006-04-03	21	18	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	Are people viewing this film objectively?  Or are people either blindly affirming it as a masterpiece or condemning it as example of Hollywood's moral perversity?  My own take was somewhat different.  If people get past the fact that it stars movie stars Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal and focus on the actual characters, the inescapable truth is that this is a film about some exceedingly uninteresting and intensely bland characters who share a love over twenty years that is societally forbidden.  Now, if the two central characters were actually interesting--and remember, in a film it is the characters and not the stars that are at the heart of things--this could have led to an interesting film.  But the brute fact is that this is a film about two central characters and several secondary characters who are all intensely and spectacularly uninteresting.I think this central fact is getting lost by most who see the film.  Anyone doubting me should go back over the dialogue the two leads engage in.  Apart from a couple of memorable lines that reflect back over a couple of decades of love, where does either of the leads say anything funny or compelling or even remotely interesting?  Where is there anything that would help us understand why either was remotely interested in the other?  If you watch THE LADY EVE, it is impossible NOT to believe that Henry Fonda would have been enthralled by Barbara Stanwyck in the first fifteen minutes of the film.  But where is there any indication that either of the two leads would have thought the other as anything but an utterly uninteresting individual?And that is for me the central problem in this film:  we are presented merely with the fact of a love between two men, but never any reason for why either would have been interested in each other.  Nor are we as viewers given any reason to care about these two characters.  In fact, at film's end, I found myself even remotely caring for only two, Michelle Williams's Alma, who has to live with the knowledge that her husband has a passion for another male, and Ennis's daughter Alma Jr.  Apart from those two, I didn't manage to find a single character interesting.Despite the dramatic vacuity at the heart of the movie, this is one of the most visually beautiful movies I've ever seen.  Every movie I see that has been filmed in the Canadian Rockies increases my desire to go there someday.  The landscapes in this are as beautifal as in any movie I have ever seen, and the incredibly gifted Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto could very well win the Oscar for Best Achievement in Cinematography.  But apart from that Oscar Nomination, I have trouble understanding any of the other nominations the film received.  Even factoring in that it was a bad year for movies, the Best Picture nomination is baffling, and Jake Gyllenhaal's Best Supporting Actor nomination is a joke, since he is clearly a lead and not a supporting actor.  I will say, however, that while Heath Ledger's character is uninteresting, he acts the part magnificently.  You would swear that this young Australian is indeed a dirt poor cowboy.  But apart from his nomination and the one for Rodgigo Prieto, I can't understand the acclaim this film is receiving.My firm belief is that this is one of those film that in ten or twenty years people are going to have an exceedingly difficult time the praise it received at the time.  My only theory is that people are blinded by the innovation of the film revolving around a male-male romance into thinking that that is sufficient to guarantee its quality.  That the two characters are profoundly uninteresting doesn't seem to faze many people.  But if there were a different film with a very dull male and very dule female character, would people have accorded it the same degree of praise?  I very much doubt it.The film is made with enormous competence.  The score is good, the direction is strong, and while the characters are uninteresting, all of the performances are quite strong.  I have not read Annie Proulx's short story upon which the film is based, but I can even imagine it being a good story.  But not all short stories can translate to the big screen and this one was crippled by the fundamentally uninteresting characters.  It is, however, a truly beautiful movie to look at.  In fact, I think much of the praise the film is receiving is in fact the reflected glory of the landscapes.  Had the story taken place in a swamp, no such praise would have attached to the film.	3.0	A film that I was very surprised to dislike	2006-02-11	68	17	51
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1EZ8W3PDA4AF3	Robin Bruce	"Went into this movie cautiously, eyes wide open.  I have to admit, I really liked it.  At first it was pretty startling.  Perhaps the movie would have been easier to watch if it didn't involve cowboys.  I think as Americans we have a preconceived idea of the rugged cowboy and homosexuality doesn't really play into it, so it takes a while to digest that part of the movie.  However, once you get past that point and further into the movie, it really doesn't matter much about the sexual orientation; it could be anyone.  It actually does become more about just two people in love and how they decide to deal with it based on the stereotypes of the period.  The only thing I had a problem with in the movie was understand Heath Ledger's ""western twang"" as it was too heavily influenced by his native Australian accent.  It was interesting to see how the women in the men's lives dealt with what their husbands sexuality entailed.  That was the only part in the movie in which I felt no sadness for Ennis and Jack because of the pain they inadvertly placed upon their families."	4.0	Not Your Typical Tear Jerker	2008-12-02	9	4	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1OBPHRXHZF8P6	"Robin Orlowski ""political activist"""	1963 Wyoming range provides a quaint and ultimately charming setting for the spirited romance between Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). These two cowboys fall in love with each other on a sheep herding job.The plot of the film though, is their carrying on the relationship in secret. The two men must do this because of whom they are and the times in which they live in. Specifically, they are after the magic of their first summer together--something readily transcending labels, categories, and generations.Director Ang Lee did a tremendous job with the movie, based upon E. Annie Proulx's short story. Credit also goes to Dianna Ossana and Larry McMurty for a great screenplay. I've unfortunately seen enough movies to know that great adaptations are the exception rather than the rule. In addition to it being set in the early 1960's there actually is the feel. It wasn't just a case of somebody claiming their film was set in the 1960's with obviously current props.I am really impressed with the people who were involved with this film. In spite of the meterosexualization of society, heterosexual American men are still squeamish about being involved with anything related to gay sex. This heterosexual woman joins Madonna in commending Ledger and Gyllenhaal both for their decision to read for the film. I honestly do find it shocking that these hang-ups remain in 2005.Some films you have to guess why they have received awards and award nominations. However, Brokeback Mountain is one of the titles where audiences will instantly know why it won or was nominated for (among the countless honors) National Board of Review Top 10 Films, Director of the Year, Los Angeles Film Critics Association Best Picture, Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture, and Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Director, Best Actor Motion Picture Drama, and Best Supporting Actress.	5.0	Yippie-yaah!	2005-12-19	24	20	4

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A28QR8AQ64LZ68	"RODNEY GILES ""Rodney, a Brokebacker in Florida"""	"I am one of those people who has seen Brokeback Mountain so many times that I am considered to be a Brokeaholic.  From the very first time I saw this magnificent film, based on the short story by Annie Proulx, brought to the screen with the words of Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry under the direction of Ang Lee, we have two fictional characters, Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, who have been achingly and heartbreakingly brought to life through the performances of actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger.  Even the author was amazed at how deeply the actors delved into their characters.  Add to that the spectacular cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto and the haunting musical score by Gustavo Santoalalla, and the sum is a truly memorable piece of artisitic film work that will be venerated for years to come.Until the DVD was released in April 2006, the only way to view the film was in the theater in the widescreen format as created by Ang Lee.  Normally I would shy away from any full screen version DVD of a film that I truly admire, but after a careful comparison between the two formats, I must admit that there are definitely reasons to invest in a full screen version.  The immediate, obvious difference is of course the width of the screen, giving the widescreen the supposed advantage.  However on very careful examination, one finds additional visual material at the top and bottom of the full screen frame, for example, the scene immediately following the ""reunion kiss"" scene.  Taking place inside the Siesta Motel, we see Jack cradling Ennis with his right arm and Ennis's left hand caressing Jack's arm.  In the full screen version we see Ennis' wedding ring throughout the scene, in the widescreen version we do not see Ennis' wedding ring at all -- the frame is simply cut so that Ennis' ring is not visible.  This is but one of 15 examples that had been given a side-by-side scene comparison.  For the avid devotees of the film, having both versions will be an absolute necessity.  For those concerned about the big-screen scenic photography of the Canadian Rockies, the DVD makes a successful translation to the TV screen.Many devoted fans of Brokeback Mountain are anxiously awaiting the possible release of a Special Edition DVD, which will hopefully include many more bonus features, such as behind the scenes footage, outtakes, director/cast commentaries, etc.  The version that was released in April is considered by most to have been a ""rushed out"" version aimed at capitalizing on the very recent awards won by the film.Recommendation:  If you have not seen the film, devote an uninterrupted period of 2-1/4 hours to fully experience this film.  Although it was summarily described as ""that gay cowboy film,"" Brokeback Mountain far transcends that simple catch phrase.  Plain and simply, Brokeback Mountain is a story of a relationship between two people, a relationship that would not have the approval of society in general, and how that relationship affects all those around them.

It would be the best movie I have ever seen. Great work from Ang Lee. This movie is about forbidden love between two men. Ledger was fantastic as ""Innes"" and Gyllenhaal was fabulous as ""Jack"". It so touched my heart I felt like standing in the middle of the road with a big sign saying : ""Watch Brokeback Mountain"". Michelle Williams, who plays Innes's wife was truly great at her role. Anne Hatheway also made a great impact on me. It is a film with 4 fantastic actors, sad yet romantic. For those who are struggling with coming out as being ""Gay"", I do reccommend this movie. It demonstartes the consequences of not following your heart, but rather what society expects of you. If you find sad movies too much to handle, then avoid this because I needed a full box of tissues nearby.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"Is it possible for a film - any film - to truly make the world a better place?  I have no way of confidently answering that question, but if any movie COULD do such a thing, then ""Brokeback Mountain"" would be that film.  Here's that rare work that has the power to transform not only how the individual sees the world but how society sees itself.  By putting something never before seen on the screen, director Ang Lee and writer Larry McMurtry earn their place in movie history - and the undying respect of film lovers everywhere.By now, most people know that ""Brokeback Mountain"" tells the story of Ennis and Jack, two young cowboys who, in the summer of 1963, sign up to herd sheep in Wyoming and wind up falling in love.  Jack is the outgoing one of the two, seemingly more in touch with his homosexuality than is Ennis, who is introverted and taciturn almost to the point of somnambulism.  Something powerful takes hold of them up there on Brokeback Mountain, and while they both end up going their separate ways - Jack to become a rodeo rider and get married, Ennis to settle down on a ranch with his wife and two little daughters - the attraction they feel for one another never lessens.  In fact, it becomes only more intense over the years, as the men come to realize that each has found in the other his true soul mate, his ideal partner for life - if only circumstances and society weren't conspiring to keep them apart.  Instead, all they have to hold on to over the next twenty years are a few fleeting but passionate encounters in the one place where they are free to be who they truly are.Tales of unrequited love have, of course, been a staple of literature since storytelling began, but by making this a GAY love story, the filmmakers bring a renewed power to the genre.  Forced to look at it from a novel perspective, we feel as if we are seeing romantic love being played out for the first time.  There are those who have accused the film of trying to ""glorify"" adulterers, as if this were the first time in which a story of unrequited love involved cheating spouses.  Would these same people object to ""Anna Karenina,"" ""Doctor Zhivago"" or ""Brief Encounter"" on such spurious grounds?  If anything, ""Brokeback Mountain"" points out the absurdity of a society that tells gay people they shouldn't even BE gay but should  live their lives as heterosexuals.  If Ennis' and Jack's wives are victims, they are far more the victims of a society that forces gays into loveless marriages than of Ennis and Jack, who are simply conforming to what society itself claims it wants them to be.By making the two central characters rugged macho cowboys, the author of the original short story, E. Annie Proulx, not only shatters a gay stereotype, but brilliantly finds the hitherto elusive portal into the consciousness of a mainstream audience.  Certainly, this story would not have worked commercially had it been about two gay hairdressers living in San Francisco.  For the first time in a Hollywood film, we have major gay characters who are not AIDS victims, psycho killers or limp-wristed best friends of the main female character.  Moreover, the movie subtly plays with the latent homoerotic undercurrents that have always been a part of western folklore but which have heretofore been hidden safely enough under the surface so that only those looking for them could find them.  Yet, for all its sociological significance, this is, first and foremost, a story about love - deep, raw, all-consuming love - and it is that which makes the movie connect with all audiences, regardless of sexual orientation.As Ennis, Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of a revelation, a triumph of minimalist acting.  With his tightly pursed lips, barely whispered monotone and slumped shoulders, Ledger brilliantly conveys the soul of a man struggling with the truth about himself and straining with every fiber in his body and being to avoid acknowledging that truth.  So tormented is he in his life that Ennis seems to be trying to pull back his words even as he's uttering them.  A masterpiece of understatement, Ledger's work here quite simply ranks with the great screen performances of all time.  As Jack, Jake Gyllenhall provides the perfect balance for Ledger, a free spirit more willing to take a chance and defy society, if only he could get his partner to go along with him.  Michelle Williams hits amazing dramatic heights as Alma, Ennis' bewildered wife, who suffers in silence after she learns the heartbreaking truth about her husband.  Anne Hathaway is effective in her few scenes as the girl who ends up roping the rodeo star Jack, unaware of who it is she has really caught.Ang Lee's direction is intense, lyrical and visually ravishing, zeroing in on the human drama with laser-like precision and making the stark Wyoming landscape an integral part of that drama.  Lee makes it so that it is the SILENCES that really matter here, those moments between words when love and feelings are most completely communicated.Just to show that even a great film need not be perfect, there are times when the movie - a tad too long at two hours and 15 minutes - sags a bit by wandering off into one too many subplots.  But the emotions in the film are so raw and engulfing that the film at its best makes us realize just how insignificant and piddling most movies really are.  This is one movie that actually stays with you long after you've left the theater.When the history of the movies comes to be written, ""Brokeback Mountain"" will take its place among the handful of films that can truly be termed ""watersheds"" or ""landmarks,"" movies that helped to redefine what cinema could be and do.  And it will be one of the few, in the long run, that really mattered."	5.0	a landmark in movie history	2006-01-09	16	12	4

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A387BD735MI50R	R. Schultz	The scenery in this movie is breathtaking. The framing and photography sweep you into the vastness of twilight prairie and mountain. You feel at the same time at one with nature, and isolated and insignificant in its grandeur.So I found visual thrills in this movie, but unfortunately not the thrill of any real love story. Yes, there can be tacit love. And yes, cowboys are notoriously taciturn. But there's a limit. Ultimately, human love has to be built on some words, on some shared history, on some weaving of one's individual biography into a shared narrative. And there is none of that here.Heath Ledger is so choked back and nonverbal in his roll as Ennis that I at first had to turn on the English subtitles to my DVD to catch what few words he is mumbling. There doesn't seem to be any point beyond the sexual in being with someone like him. He has no enlarging view to offer, no wit, no sustaining support. And the Jack Twist character isn't much better.But the men's failure as lovers goes beyond their inarticulateness. If you truly love someone, you carry a lamp glowing inside you. You see reflections of that person in everyone you meet and so you confer that spark to all your encounters in life. You bring that spark to everything you do. It sustains and animates you. It makes you want to perfect. And there was none of that here.To the contrary, the two men make the lives of their everyday spouses and girlfriends a misery by their inexplicable unavailability, their withdrawal and lack of essential interest. They are always elsewhere. They are always frozen in disaffection for the ones with whom they might really have forged some bond, albeit not a bond based on any sexual urgency.Lust aches. Love lightens. So this relationship never much gets beyond lust. Instead of carrying their forbidden love as a secret charm that could radiate, the two men in this movie schlep through their days spreading a sort of emotional blight wherever they go. Instead of being a tragedy about how prejudice prevented two people from being together, the overriding tragedy of this movie is how often people can't get beyond specific sexual craving in order to joyfully abide in the life that is proffered to them.Finally, were the namings of these two characters (Ennis and Twist) a little too suggestive? I didn't read the Annie Proulx short story on which this movie is based. So I don't know if her original characters had these names. If they did, it seems to undermine any serious, heartfelt intent for the story. By the unlikely coincidence of these men having Stud Magazine names, it in fact seems to reduce and doom their relationship from the outset to - just sex.	3.0	No Love Lost	2006-04-16	64	16	48
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1NYZQRQ6JR2RC	R. Schwartz	"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a masterpiece of a film.  Everyone involved deserves kudos for bringing this brilliant film to the screen.The Academy Awards showed Hollywood's ugly side when it did not name ""Brokeback Mountain"" best picture.Most of the praise for this movie has gone to Heath Ledger and his brilliant performance.  However equal praise needs to go to Jake Gyllenhaal for his amazing work in this movie.  Many people have only given Jake's performance a brief mention, including Amazon editor, Mark Englehart.  Well, I say pay equal attention to Jake.  His Jack is the heart of this love story.  He is especially amazing in their final scenes.  He captures the words of Annie Proulx in their most tender scenes.  While some may think it is easier to play the less intense character, I say that is not true.  Jack's love, hurt, pain and bitterness come through in equal measure.  He says so much with his eyes it is heartbreaking.  Also, the Jack character should get attention because he is brave and is willing to live his life with the person he loves.  He is not afraid of his feelings and that is so important.  And while some think his aging job was not good, it is exactly accurate to the time period. And praise needs to go to Anne Hathaway.  While her role is not as big, it is very important and her last scene is fantastic.  Along with the wonderful Michelle Williams and her heartbreaking Alma.Overall a brilliant film that deserves all the accolades and awards it has received.

And this story is about two men trying to meet up on the sly to have a quick shag. That's it!Also it looks to me that Annie Proulx disapproves of homosexuality. Men are interested in having sex, with women usually and any woman will do. If there isn't one around a bloke will have to do (as in this case). Failing that sheep and donkeys and the odd Pespi book will have to suffice. So, far from men being born that way they choose it if that is the only kind of sex available. Men in prison have sex with each other for that very reason. If homosexuals are born &#34;that way&#34; why do they get married and only 20 years later &#34;realise&#34; that they are gay? It's because they chose to &#34;realise&#34; they were gay. Lets not forget both these men could have choosen celibacy but that never occured to them. (and why not?). So the author has written a story which portrays men as morally slippery and as every good feminist will tell you men can't be trusted because they will shag anything on a whim and think about the consequences later.I know lots of people (many of them women apparently) wept buckets over this but to me I found them them repellent. I felt a lot of sympathy with their wives who paid a heavier price than their men. The two men made their decision and had to live with the consequences but so did their wives which stinks.	1.0	What on earth was all the fuss about?	2014-04-04	10	0	10

Where are the MANY deleted scenes, the Ang Lee commentary, the costume, production, location, etc etc sections?

For family and friends who put up with my constant insistence that they see it, for people who need to have it, but didn't (and wouldn't) buy it for themselves, for those who WILL be impressed by this lineup of quasi-bonuses and would settle for the original DVD, it's a wonderful holiday gift.

A DUNN	"This movie is the touchstone for those of us who had our own brokeback Mountains sometime in our lives.I had my Brokeback Mountain when I turned 16 in the outskirts of Pocatello, Idaho.  There are things you know, things you do not want to know, and things you force from yourself like the plague, lest the truth peeks out and you then face the fact that you just might be ""one of them.""Southeastern Idaho in 1970 was not much different than Wyoming in 1963.  In a Mormon dominated country culture, roles are die-cast, and anything divergant was an abomination.  In the ""Jack"" Mormon culture of bars, railroading and redneck cutter racing, there were ""Us,"" ""The Hippies,"" and of course, there were ""Them.""  And noone in their right mind would ever want to be concieved as ""one of them.""Yet there were those of us who lived the Ennis del-Mar and Jack Twist story.  It was ""us"" who suffered through all the unwritten rules, mores, and bigotries of the culture who portrayed a gun slinging John Wayne as the acme of ""what a man should be.""  Stereotypes abounded on what ""they"" were and how ""they"" acted and ""behaved.""  Brokeback mountain shatters these perceived stereotypes.  We, as Jack and Ennis learned early to fight what came natural to us, as we strove to fit in, keep silent and deny what was really going on in our minds and hearts.The real tragedy is that we became little more than robots, and although we fooled ourselves into believing we were straight, we were really little more than jointed wooden images in our traditional marriages.  See how both Jack and Ennis act so wooden in their marraiges and how they come to life only in each others arms, and you will see what I mean.If only I could once again meet Terry on my Brokeback Mountain, after 35 years have past!  Today I would have the guts to do what I couldnt do back then: Look him in the eyes and tell him what I REALLY felt.After surviving the Atomic Wars of divorce, estrangement by immediate family, I got my reward.  I am LIVING my own Brokeback Mountain in Washington State with my beloved Eddie.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A13X6CJZL9HHJE	Sahag Gureghian	I was really glad that BROKEBACK didn't win Best Picture.  The more I think about this movie, the more I think it's actually a very BAD movie, both politically and artistically.  First of all, it reinforces all sorts of negative stereotypes about gay men (they prey on and lure straight men into their way of life and ruin marriages and are promiscuous and are ultimately lonely and pathetic and/or die of AIDS or are bashed to death).  Secondly, it's not about love, it's about animal lust done by two incredibly selfish men who, if the story were straight, would have had feminist groups up in arms in anger.  Finally, it is yet another gay movie about beautiful men who don't exist in real life for anyone outside of those with lots of money who can afford the gym bunnies of west Hollywood.I didn't see CRASH, but I assume it was at least not self oppressive and ugly.	1.0	Overhyped Hollywood Garbage!	2006-03-08	187	29	158
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2X16RE4EGN0UJ	Saintseattle	"I was one of the first to see ""Brokeback Mountain"" when it first hit theatres. I was apprehensive at first. Most movies with a ""gay theme"" are somewhat campy or portray gay men as ""fem"" or the stereotypical limp wrist.  However, this movie didn't try to paint gay men with a broad brush like many films do. ""Brokeback Mountain"" portrayed gay men in a human and honest fashion. It did so while gently and convincingly telling a story that is so believable and genuine that if you do not feel any emotions after viewing the film, you sadly missed out on a wonderful and special experience.  For those of you who unfortunately did not come away from this film with a profound sense of joy and gratitude that doesn't mean this was a bad film.As anyone can see from the overwhelming positive and emotional responses this film has generated, it has had a significant and very real impact on millions upon millions of fans whose lives are forever changed.Even if you are one of the rare people who simply didn't ""get"" this movie. Please don't denegrate this film and try to belittle the wonderful and moving experience an overwhelming majority of film-goers now cherish.This is a film that will be remembered.

For this reason, this movie jump away from anything Hollywood, and dive right in to human emotion, love, and tragedy. In the end, though the Oscar board did not have the courage to give Brokeback Mountain the awards, the people awarded the movie with many time over in both Box Office and DVD sales than the Oscar winner, Crash.This movie shows how, when someone can put their selfish reasons aside and concentrate on higher purposes, they can truly produce magnificent masterpieces such as Brokeback Mountain.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2QSL00CRP8CLZ	Sami	Last night was the Academy Awards and I must say that I'm really disappointed. For months Brokeback was given such high reviews, not to mention all the awards that it received except for ONE. It's a shame that our society cannot except everyone for who they are and what their sexual preference is. I saw Brokeback Mountain at the end of January and I still think about it everyday. Some people might say that sounds a little over the top but that's how much the story impacted me. A film has never made me feel so emotional. It's a love story...plain and simple...but it's much, much more. God love you Ang Lee for making such a wonderful film! All of the actors should be so proud of themselves also. I'm sorry, I have seen Crash and it was a very good movie, but it should have never won for best picture. I think Hollywood got so paranoid thinking an openly gay movie was actually going to win and had to put a stop to it. That's only my opinion....

There are moments in the film that I don't think I fully understood or heard what was being said...a couple days later I caught my mind thinking about the story, the characters, and the effect the film had on me. So, I waited a couple weeks and watched it again.It was so refreshing to see a gay-themed story told without all the stereotypes that so many other movies seem to be trapped into...The actors are believable, the soundtrack was beautifully complementary...leave your expectations at the door and just watch the movie and characters unfold, and you will thoroughly enjoy the experience.	5.0	Days later, you will think about this film...	2006-01-12	7	6	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A36U2QROEWJCLY	"Sam Twain ""Book Maven"""	"For someone who reads review more than writing them, it is very rare for me to want to write reviews at all. Even with a movie that I absolutely loved such as Broke Back Mountain, I really did not feel the motivation to write a review until after I see how many propaganda driven, lack of depth, shallow idiots wrote reviews for this movie, just so they can accomplish what politicians and church activist want ever since this movie received the recognitions and nominations they deserve.Broke back Mountain portrayed the universal truth about love, that ""Love Is Deepest When It Is Most Difficult."" The story starts off with two cowboys, both in desperate situations financially; both came from a less than perfect background. Then, they work in jobs without any support from their employers, and the only people that can comfort them are themselves. Anyone in this situation would fall in love, but their love extends way beyond that. Through the time they spend on Broke Back Mountain, characteristics that these two are destined lovers began to play out. For example, Jack's energetic spirit is the kind of energy needed to awake the comfort within Ennis, while Ennis's calm but firm spirit is the kind of caring nature Jack needs. They both share the same values, same thoughts, and if this were a girl-boy movie, as all the third rated movies Hollywood have made perhaps too much of due to a lack of extraordinary writer and director as talented as Annie Proulx and Ang Lee, then it would be easy to see that these two are suppose to be lovers. But why should the situation be any different when it comes to Two Men? It isn't any different, and finally, on a cold night on Broke Back Mountain, the two started the love that was already meant to happen.Deep inside Jack and Ennis, and perhaps every viewer of Broke Back Mountain, there is a realization that Jack and Ennis are meant to be together, instead of going seperately to wives because of the propaganda they are surrounded with. Yet, that is exactly what broke Jack and Ennis apart: Propaganda. These men would have been extraordinary together, but the propaganda that men should be with women force them into separate lives, and when Jack wants to escape this Propaganda, he is killed. Ennis lived on his own from that point on, and carried on this love for the rest of his life.Now ask yourself, are you viewing the core of this movie? Or are you judging this movie by the surface which, due to the same propaganda that kept Jack and Ennis apart, is a love that is not suppose to happen. All of you who think very lowly of this movie did it because you claim that these men are not in love. Yet you would say that the other Hollywood flicks, which is filled with people who just have sex on each other when they meet, and dump each others the next day, is true love. Some of you even claimed that this book portrayed that [...] life is miserable, and this movie is about two miserable men seeking each other for sexual release. You are right, these men are miserable, but how can they not be when people like you are pressuring propaganda on them? Stop, and take the gender issue away for a moment. The qualities they show both themselves, and towards others, show a level of loving integrity that no other romance scenes from any other movie, [...] or straight, has ever showed, and yet you refused to call it love. Let me ask you a question, if what they show is not love, then what is?If the displays of love and affection between these men do not come logical to you, it is because Ang Lee had to delete scenes from the original script so that narrow minded people like you won't be offended by it. If love between two men is the reason you don't like this movie, then perhaps it is time that you expand your horizon and be more accepting towards all forms of love, instead of expecting director Ang Lee to place a limit on love for you. If the misery you see is what displeases you, then let it be a lesson to you to create a more pleasant and accepting world for everyone so that these tragedies, which is still occurring in modern society, will never happen again. Finally, if you rated an movie that provokes new thoughts and emotions within the viewers, depths of understanding towards human nature, and a cry for a different way to live as 3 stars and below, then know that this is how you rate your integrity, as there is simply no reason to compromise true beauty towards your personal bias.Now let's look at this movie once again. Does this movie has a script that has depth, content, and provocative yet beautiful? Yes! Does this movie have a director that truly gets the inner beauty of the script, and enhances it while playing it out to the world? Yes! Does this movie has extraordinary actors and filmed with extraordinary theatrical skills? Yes! Does this movie that satisfied all criteria that define an once-in-a-lifetime, extraordinary movie, and even exceed all criteria and expectations and come out on top deserve an honor of the highest regard? Most definitely!In fact, Jack Nicholson, who announced the result for the best picture of the year, is the exact person that said that he refuses to watch a movie as single minded as Broke Back Mountain. Apparently he and the entire Oscar board decided that they can critic a movie without even laying an eye on it! But Broke Back Mountain is still chosen by the people, and received an extraordinary 8 nominations to Oscar. The same is true to all viewers of Broke Back Mountain. This movie deserves 5 stars if not more, and that's what needs to appear on the Amazon rating page. We cannot allow narrow minded individuals who can only see a surface that is covered by propaganda, and cannot delve into the deeper meaning of this movie pull down the rating that this movie actually deserves. Let us all give this movie a 5 stars on Amazon, and 10 stars in our books so that the prejudice of these idiots can be negated, and so that this movie can get the rating it truly deserves!"	5.0	Not a Movie For Shallow Idiots	2006-04-11	8	6	2
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A32XW50ILWOXNO	Samuel McKewon	"The deepest wounds to ""Brokeback Mountain"" have been inflicted by those who trumpet as more than the humble masterpiece that it is. A breakthrough picture for gay rights...a torch for tolerance...such bouquets diminish the universal themes found in the movie's story of two men - one gay, one confused, both broken - and their 20-year love affair after a summer herding sheep in the Wyoming highlands. ""Brokeback Mountain"" drips with longing and regret that knows no sexual orientation.Director Ang Lee opens his picture in a gravel parking lot occupied by Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). They're silent strangers brought together by ranch manager Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid). Jack's estranged from his father. Ennis' dad is dead. Aside from the job, that's their first bond. They swap jobs once on the mountain. They drink whiskey, shoot coyotes, curse the beans in tomato sauce. Jack makes a move one night when they both sleep in the tent. Ennis relents. The experience and the totality of the summer ruins him.The Academy Award winning screenplay from Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana explores how the men live on unsteadily, marry women, have children, and get together one or twice a year for a ""fishing trip."" That's a change from E. Annie Proulx's source short story, which mostly recounts Ennis and Jack's arguments and passions during their encounters. What Lee, McMurtry and Ossana transform her story into is an epic that reveals the pain Ennis spreads to his wife Alma (Michelle Williams), the daughter most like him (Kate Mara) and, after divorcing Alma, to a hopeful waitress named Cassie (Linda Cardellini). Jack has more of an agreement with his hardened Daddy's girl Lureen (Anne Hathaway) than a marriage - ""we could do it over the phone,"" he tells Ennis - and it frees him to make as many trips to Mexican bathhouses as he chooses.Jack's a dreamer, and he begs Ennis to work a ranch with him. Ennis answers with a childhood story about a couple cowboys who live together, ""tough old birds,"" who were found beaten and castrated at the bottom of a ditch. It goes on like that, Jack wanting more than Ennis will give. Jack wants the summer eternal. Ennis, broke, estranged from his own children, unable to look his ex-wife in the eye, is also wracked with love and lust, yet empty, distant.For all its anguish, ""Brokeback Mountain"" has a lovely, good-natured screenplay full of small asides and local humor, probably courtesy of McMurtry (""Lonesome Dove,"" ""The Last Picture Show""). It allows us to enjoy the men as men, the women as women, a laugh as a laugh. Lee orchestrates a particularly good scene on Thanksgiving, where a long-running feud between Jack and his father-in-law culminates in an argument over whether Jack's son can watch TV during dinner. Lee is a model of restraint in every scene but one, where a buff Jack washes his torso while Ennis sits in the foreground, cooking beans. Lee has already helmed a domestic masterpiece in ""The Ice Storm;"" he combines his ability to reveal dining-table truths with artistic helicopter shots of the mountain.Ledger is some actor. It takes range to play the burdened Ennis, Casanova and surfer hippie (""The Lords of Dogtown"") in one year. He is the picture of repression in ""Brokeback Mountain"" a character worth genuine pity who, when he finds the right words for his daughter in the movie's last scene, has accomplished a feat 20 years in the waiting. That he reserves it for her is overlooked by most critics - Proulx's story doesn't have this ending - but crucial to appreciating what Ennis has learned. Gyllenhaal is 25, yet he plays the older Jack fiercely. He's a selfish SOB, but hard not to like. Both twang and spit the distinctive cowboy chatter of the screenplay with ease. Williams and Hathaway convey enough in short onscreen bursts, and the pretty Mara, like Ledger, transmits a lot through her silences.To its end, ""Brokeback Mountain"" refuses to underline itself. It is a calm, sad, loving sigh of a thing. So while the inevitable, crude backlash is unfortunate, Lee does his own efforts no great favor to rewrite his film as an event or monument when it was made on a modest budget as modest movie about average men. And Proulx's letter to the Academy following the movie's Best Picture loss to ""Crash"" is arrogant and damaging to the potential audience it could reach. This is a work of art. Not an essay. Pop culture has done it few favors. Maybe time will."	5.0	An exercise in humanity and humility (in case you thought it was a statement movie)	2006-04-04	41	36	5

Compared to this movie, Crash is just another action movie about Racism.The only comforting thing to note about Crash is that, no matter how the Academy rated it, did not do nearly as well in the eyes of movie viewers. It only had a 3 1/2 star on Amazon, with only 50 million in US Box office, nothing internationally. Compared to Crash, Brokeback Mountain produced 83 million in US alone, and 166 Million Internationally.

Ang Lee calmly unfolds the canvas on which he has captured the heart and spirit of Annie Poulx's raw and honest short story. The spectacular Western landscapes represent the spirit of purity and endurance, and Brokeback Mountain is that special place where love can be freely expressed. Jack and Ennis are only visitors to this paradise, but while there, they discover a love that will endure through the rest of their lives. But back in the harsh mundane world, Ennis' internal struggle to deal with this love is the heart of the movie. Tied down by his fears, Ennis refuses over and over to build on their relationship despite Jack's many entreaties.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AC15VZFIMZOOK	"S. A. Rader ""Pop Culture Extrodinare"""	First of all let me clarify, I hated this movie because it was a bad movie.  I have no homophobic feelings, whatsoever.  The kiss between Jack and Ennis when Michelle Williams first sees them is a wonderful scene.I just thought this movie went haywire from the beginning.  First, it was horribly and strangely miscast.  Sure, Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams are compelling and turn in sound performances, but the rest of the cast was completely misplaced.  Jake Gyllenhall isn't a cowboy, he is a great actor, but every one of his scenes was laughable due to his and my uncomfort with him playing a cowboy.  Anne Hathaway was in the movie, I guess, to dye her hair every other scene.  And let me point out the other strange casting . . . Randy Quaid and Anna Farris??Secondly, while the movie may have been a political victory, maybe they should have focused on making it a film victory.  Ang Lee is a horrible story teller.  All his movies jump around incoherrently and in this case sometimes creepily (the scene where Ennis goes to visit Jack's parents still gives me nightmares.)  He has a spectacular eye and the cinematography is great, as is the soundtrack, but the directing and the script are a mess.Finally, and this is the most important point, (SPOILER) Jake Gyllenhall's death is just another part of the obnoxiousness of this movie.  Yes, it is sad they couldn't share their love to the world.  Yes, it is sad that people attack people just because of their sexuality, but watching Jack get attacked with a tire iron screamed CLICHE!  I wanted to vomit.  It was at that point that I was really just watching the same old love story, like Titanic, without a boat.  Who cares if they are two men . . . the love story is a typical one, and that why it was so easy for so many to swallow.  This is nothing that Guess Who's Comming to Dinner or West Side Story or Say Anything wasn't, the only thing that makes it worse than those movies . . . it isn't clever of cutting edge or worth the two and a half hours.I give this movie a very vehemet one star!	1.0	Worst Movie This Year . . .	2006-05-05	94	26	68

The film documents their complex relationship over the next twenty years.Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.When the two men first begin work on Brokeback Mountain, Ennis is stationed at the base camp while Jack watches after the sheep higher on the mountain. They initially meet only for meals at the base camp, where they gradually become friends. After a time they switch roles, with Jack taking over duties at base camp and Ennis tending the flock. One night, after the two share a bottle of whiskey, Ennis decides to remain at the base camp overnight instead of returning up the mountain. Ennis is at first reluctant to even sleep in the same tent as Jack, but late that night the men share a brief, intense sexual encounter. Over the remainder of the summer their sexual and emotional relationship deepens further.After the two part ways at the end of their job, Ennis marries his long-term fianc&eacute;e Alma Beers (Williams), and starts a family. Jack moves to Texas, where he meets and marries rodeo princess Lureen Newsome (Hathaway). The couple soon has a son.Four years later, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack asking if he wants to meet when Jack passes through the area. The men reunite, and their passion immediately rekindles. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life together on a small ranch. Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of the torture and murder of a gay man in his hometown, fears that such an arrangement can only end in tragedy. He is also unwilling to leave his family. Unable to be open about their relationship, Ennis and Jack settle for infrequent meetings on camping trips in the mountains.Ledger as Ennis Del Mar.As the years pass, Ennis's marriage deteriorates. Unknown to him, the relationship was discovered by Alma who eventually divorces him and takes custody of their two daughters. Jack hopes that Ennis's divorce will allow them to live together at last, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Meanwhile, his oldest daughter, Alma Junior, visits Ennis on a periodic basis, and Ennis meets and dates a waitress. On another trip with Jack in the mountains, Ennis insists, to keep his job, he cannot meet with Jack again before November. Ennis and Jack's frustrations finally erupt into a bitter argument and a struggle becoming a desperate embrace. However, the two men part upset.Months later, a postcard Ennis sent to Jack, about meeting in November, is returned in the mail, stamped ""deceased"". In a strained telephone conversation, Jack's wife Lureen tells Ennis that Jack died in an accident. As she explains, a brief scene of Jack being beaten to death, by 3 men, illustrates Ennis' fears that Jack's death was not accidental. Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wished to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain. She suggests that Ennis contact Jack's parents about this.Ennis visits Jack's parents and offers to take Jack's ashes to Brokeback Mountain. Jack's father refuses, insisting that Jack's remains be buried in the family plot. Jack's mother is more welcoming, and allows Ennis to see Jack's boyhood bedroom. Ennis discovers in this room, two old shirts hidden in the back of the closet. The shirts, hung one inside the other on the same hanger, are the ones the two men were wearing on their last day on Brokeback Mountain in 1963.Shortly after Ennis meets Jack's parents, his daughter visits him at his home. Now 19 years old, she's getting ready to marry a boy, and asks for her father's consent in giving her away at the wedding. Ennis seems initially reluctant, citing that he might have to work, but decides against it and pours two glasses of whiskey for him and his daughter with which to celebrate. Ennis asks if her fiance loves her, and she affirms that he does.At the end of the movie, Ennis opens his own closet to reveal that he has hung the two shirts reversed, with his plaid shirt hugging Jack's blue shirt, inside the door beneath a postcard of Brokeback Mountain. Ennis carefully fastens the top button of Jack's shirt. With tears in his eyes, Ennis mutters, ""Jack, I swear . . . ."" [9], and then, he slowly, carefully straightens the postcard of Brokeback Mountain and closes the door. As the door closes on the closet, it opens a long view to the outside, through the window, to the green and yellow fields and the dirt road outsideHeath Ledger has putten his best in the movie. Michelle Williams was good in her role as an innocent wife who discovers her husband's secret. The rest of the supporting cast was good as well Jake ....., Anne Hathaway and Randy Quaid.The movie is outstanding. Great direction by Anglee. Brilliant Cinematography.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3U6WGSBAECZAF	"!Scipio Africanus, Vanquisher of Hannibal ""Th..."	"It remains an insolvable enigma as to why Brokeback Mountain--this radicalized, g*y agenda-endorsing recruitment drive with no redeemable merits--has such an overwhelmingly, almost fanatically agreed-upon approval by reviewers who are either declining to use morals in evaluating the film, or are simply too nave, short-sighted, or gullible to know better!!!! Brokeback Mountain is far from a controversial movie; insinuating that it's merely controversial makes it appear as though it has points of contention which have good arguments on either side. In morally clear and stark reality, however, Brokeback has absolutely no redeemable qualities since it advocates (in no particular order) the dissolution of marriage; alternative lifestyles which threaten the traditional, nuclear family; infidelity; and pursuit of one's animalistic lust in spite of the consequences.In a nutshell, Brokeback recounts the distressing story of two bisexuals who get into each other's pants while working as sheep herders in Wyoming; they worsen this irreligious affair by continuing their illegal, clandestine lust while being married and trying to raise families later on!!!! Reprimanding Brokeback for the g*y-pushing propaganda that it is isn't deserving of accusations of ""bigotry""--as the simple-minded moral relativists who rave about Brokeback fall back on whenever their ideological movie is justifiably criticized. Besides the fact that the vast majority of Americans still rejects g*y marriage/civil unions and its destruction of traditional and therefore sustainable society, criticism against Brokeback also involves a totally non-g*y related issue: the advocacy of infidelity and the breakup of the nuclear family the film pushes.When Ennis and Jack ""see"" each other on their wilderness hikes, they're engaging in an illicit affair which callously hurts their respective wives and their innocent children!!!! If a person were to interpret Brokeback as the poster movie for the fictional concept of ""g*y rights,"" one can conclude that g*ys are for the destruction of families, the unit which ensures a stable, orderly society. G*ys themselves ought to exercise some moral clarity and be outraged that another liberal, Hollywood movie represents their demographic so unflatteringly. This movie is such a cold, typical, liberal-minded exercise in the ideology of ""if it feels good, do it,"" that it warrants the illicit lust of two g*ys to be together in total selfishness despite all the pain they're inflicting on their families and all the responsibilities they have to them.As with any predictable, liberal movie from Hollywood--which is misguidedly for the fiction that g*y ""rights"" are somehow ""constitutional"" despite that homosexuality is based only on willful behavior instead of something that's inherent in people--Brokeback abuses notions of longing and the alleged ""true love"" between Ennis and Jack to feloniously justify all the ruination their g*y relationship brings. The scheme of the devious filmmakers was clearly to cast Brokeback as a hard-to-believe, innocent ""love story."" By perpetrating this fr*ud, the filmmakers are successful in provoking reactions of sentimentality and empathy from the generally moral relativist/unobservant, movie-going public, which direly needs some conservatism so they can identify these noxious schemes by the liberals in entertainment. By selling Brokeback as a mere ""love story,"" all the more sinister implications that I've rationally outlined above can be dismissed.This is the reprehensibly unscrupulous spin the moral relativist supporters of this film misuse to justify the radicalized, g*y-agenda push. However, even half-educated persons will be able to see through this ruse, as Brokeback Mountain is nothing but a fierce advocate for g*y marriage also. The movie's plot is maneuvered in such a way that the traditional, heterosexual marriages of Ellis and Alma and Jack and Lureen, respectively, are derided as ""obstacles"" which stand in the way of the g*y ""love-fest"" of Ennis and Jack. As such, Brokeback flagrantly pushes the misconstruction that Ennis and Jack could've been together and their families spared the pain if, and ONLY if, g*y marriage was legalized in the US (which will NEVER happen, thankfully, due to conservatives and traditionalists).Brokeback was an ideological movie which quickly lost the sensationalistic ""steam"" the liberal media kept forging for it, sputtering to a mean total of merely $83 million at the end of its domestic run. This not-too-surprising phenomenon was glaringly due to the fact that mainly liberals in the coastal, blue states were the primary driving force of this irreligious movie, but traditionalists in the Heartland, the Midwest and the South wisely didn't bother with this foulness.All the misleading exaggerations about the awards Brokeback's received are discreditable because the ones giving out the rewards are the same liberal, Hollywood and entertainment-circle degenerates who endorse g*y ""rights."" Folks who misinform you that Brokeback's really about the love between two people are doing the work of g*y, special interests, as Brokeback glorifies infidelity, the ruination of marriage, and the hurting of children. Brokeback's recommended viewing so it can disclose to people just how anti-traditional and radicalized the ""values"" of the g*y marriage/""rights"" cause are!!!!"	1.0	This ferociously liberal, pro-g*y Movie really curses Traditional Marriage, endorses the hurting of children, & is all-out mean!	2008-05-09	61	9	52

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A22E90Y0HAJMDO	S. Demers	this is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. truly one of the most beautifully haunting love stories ever brought to the screen. usually i hate cheesy romances and love stories, but this is nothing of the sort- the actors do a superb job of capturing the conflicting emotions of being in love with someone that society deems unnatural or a crime, and the heart-wrenching angst that they feel is beautifully conveyed through their actions and expressions. i would highly recommend this film to anyone- i can watch it over and over and every time it makes me cry thinking about a) how difficult it was to be a gay man in a small town back in the 60s and how many people suffered because of that, and b) sadly how this is still true for many individuals growing up in closed-minded or strictly religious communities	5.0	one of my favorites	2008-09-16	8	6	2

They can't just live normal, happy lives like we do in real life.Please people, see the big picture here. This isn't the great gay love story everyone is making it out to be.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2YMJU44CUFQIM	seywhut	This was a very good movie but definitely not a kid's movie.  It didn't rub homosexual behavior in your face and I think it gave straight people another view of homosexuality that they really weren't aware of.  A genuine true love between &#34;two people&#34; regardless of their sexual orientation.  And it showed how life is life.  It did get a bit maudlin in couple of times but you certainly came away from the picture emotionally moved.  I don't care how straight you are.  LOL!  It was certainly a bold step for it's time.  I remember well when it came out.  I lived in a very rural small southern town and this movie was NOT shown in theaters here.  We had to drive over an hour away to a large city to see it because in this town they &#34;weren't gonna show some damn movie about queer cowboys.&#34;  If that's your mentality then skip it.  You will find it threatening even though the sexuality of it was very gracefully handled and not vulgar.The funniest memory about this film and I'm not joking - when we went to see it in the city, I swear, this group of young children with 2 nuns were in the theater sitting nearly on the front row.  I thought, &#34;Do they not have a clue what this is about?&#34;  When it got to the scene where the characters made love for the first time - man those nuns were SNATCHING kids up and yanking them out of the theater!

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A19169THT46WEA	"SF Designer ""sfdesigner"""	I've read many of the reviews here, and the sense I get is that more people than not are applauding the importance of being open to all forms of love, and not just hetero-love. And I couldn't agree more with that concept. It is also important that more of the world be exposed to the concept that same-sex couples can love each other. I couldn't be more supportive of that either. So regardless of whatever negative comments are made about my review, I want to say up front that I am 100% supportive of gay rights, gay marriage, gay love, and gay folks being treated exactly the same as straight folks. Nuff said.But now I'm going to talk about this movie. I went into it really wanting to love it. I was so happy that a movie had been made featuring gay (or at least bi) men as the focus of this romance, and that it had been nominated for so many Academy Awards. I had high hopes. However just as far as rating it as I would rate any movie... forgetting the fact that it has such a groundbreaking gay theme... I really felt that the movie did not hold up to what I would expect for any Oscar nominated movie. I felt that the character development was so cryptic that I never understood what these two men loved about each other. I wish there had been more up-close scenes where I was shown special moments between the two, so that I could see how their love built. Instead, the story just jumped forward with starts and stops, showing them fishing, swimming, rough-housing, and whatever... but it wasn't the kind of stuff that made me feel like I understood either of them. I would expect this from any romance movie. I also felt that the jumpiness of the storyline got in the way of the entire movie. It wasn't a smooth storytelling experience. Little bits here and there, and a myriad of partially-developed characters or plot developments that never were fleshed out. I felt that the director should have focused on fewer directions, and given just those a bit more depth as a whole. The B.M. boss coming up the first time to discuss a sick uncle, but they stay up there, and there was no further mention of the uncle. And then the boss coming up a second time and telling them that they were to leave the mountain early. Why? If he were so incensed by their relationship, he should have just said something the first time. What's with the clutter of this uncle news? And the main fella has two daughters for the first half of the movie, but in the second half, only one is around with no mention of the other. Why? And what was the point of her asking if she could live with him, and then being so agreeable when he says no? I just don't see what these things added to the storytelling experience. I'm only naming a few of these examples that for me, cluttered up the movie from beginning to end.I believe that if this movie had been made about a straight couple, that it would be pulled apart completely by the critics. That the lack of character development and the director's storytelling style would not hold up to the standards generally held by great movies. And that it is simply the fact that the two main characters are men, that is causing so many people to praise it so highly. And again -- I am totally supportive of movies embracing the subject of gay romance. And I am delighted that this is a mainstream example of gay men that don't fit into the stereotypical effeminate Queer Guy for the Straight Guy mannerisms that seem so prevalent in movies/tv in general.For me, the bottom line is just one of disappointment. I really wanted to love this movie, and really felt that it failed. I'm going to give it two stars though -- one for the subject matter and one for the scenic vistas. And I will hold out hopes that this movie will end up being the first step towards mainstreaming this subject matter, so that future genuinely great movies can be made featuring gay themes.	2.0	I REALLY wanted to like this movie and I REALLY didn't.  :(	2006-02-18	77	23	54

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2UG7GWVZAZ40G	"Shadoheart ""Book & Movie Fanatic"""	"Love is a force of nature...the tagline from this incredible movie...sums up in essence the message portrayed on the screen. Ennis DelMar and Jack Twist (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall respectively) first encounter each other while waiting for possible work. The first few minutes of the movie are without dialogue, establishing through brilliant direction and camera work the tone that already exists between the two men as they look everywhere but at each other. After getting the job, they wind up on Brokeback Mountain, tending sheep. The vast vistas of the land...the wide open sky...and the lonely and simple music of Gustavo Santaolalla, all serve to enhance the isloation of these two men. The rest of the world seems to not exist...only Jack and Ennis. Jack, the more animated of the two, has a certain childlike quality about him, his puppy-dog eyes revealing much that his words do not. Ennis, in opposition, seems like a man older than his years with the weight of the world on his shoulders. The interaction between them is brief, curt, and true to life as two people, isolated from all others, are forced to come to grips with each other's personalities. The love that grows out of this, however, is one that can only happen once in a lifetime. Becoming friends, and then more than friends, Jack and Ennis forge a bond that spans decades and a lifetime. Through all that life brings them, marriages, children, divorce, loss of jobs, family problems, and even discovery by Ennis' wife, the ties that bind them together survive. While Jack wants more, believing they can build a life together, dispite what society considers exceptable, Ennis, ever stoic, believes otherwise. As the story unfolds over the years, the viewer is taken along on each man's personal journey, witnessing the lives that they lead while holding fast to each other through occasional fishing trips that do not involve fishing. The climax of the movie leaves the viewer stunned, even if prepared by reading the book, and induces an emotional firestorm, calling to mind past loves, current partners, and future dreams. Heath Ledger bestowes the performance of his career on the viewer with dignity and emotional depth that was only hinted at in his previous work. Jake Gyllenhall finally realizes the potential that the critics foresaw in him and also puts in his best work to date. The interaction of the two principal actors is believable, conceivable, and all together entrancing. The supporting cast is also brilliant, each bringing to their character a fully realized person no matter the size of their role. The direction and cinematography is a masterpiece, bringing to light the isolation of the wilderness, the desperation of small towns of the era, and the complete dissimilarity of the classes of the time. Ang Lee has created a world where the viewer feels he or she can touch, taste, smell, and feel all that is portrayed on the screen. The movie itself is beyond masterful and has the potential to change one's view...perhaps one's life. If a viewer can watch this movie and not be moved beyond any expectation, if they can watch this movie and walk away without tears in their eyes, then they are completely incapable of understanding love or their prejudices are such that they are blinding themselves to the realities of the world. The movie claims that ""Love is a force of nature""...bold words and ones that a cynic can easily discount. However, when you see this remarkable film, you will truly believe."	5.0	Love Is A Force Of Nature	2006-02-07	29	22	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AWCDFMA7M6P6B	shane2006	Brokeback Mountain is a tale of love. It's NOT about two gay cowboys---well it is, but that's not the main moral to the story. Annie Proulx wrote an amazing short story about two sheep hearderd who fall in love in 1960s Wyoming, and when it is reborn by director Ang Lee (Academy Award Winner---Brokeback Mountain, 2005) who brings it to life in its full fledged glory. Heath Ledger, Enus, is one of the best actors of our time, and now he finally proves it with Brokeback. Jake Gyllenhaal, Jack, also on one of the best young talents in Hollywood deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, but it was George Clooney's year, and Clooney was excellent in Syriana as well.Director Ang Lee makes this superb film, capturing the beauty and mystery of the mountains in Wyoming. Enus (Ledger) is an engaged cowboy who is looking for a job when he finds one, hearding sheep in the mountains of Brokeback with another cowboy, Jack (Gyllenhaal). The two begin to lose control of themselves, and then end up falling in love within the first twenty minutes of the film. Enus is engaged to Alma, played by the wonderful Michelle Williams. She soon finds out the truth of her husband. Jack later marries Lureen, played by Havoc's Anne Hathaway who bares all in the best roll, next to her part in Havoc (a 2005 film that was released straight on DVD---check into it), of her career. She plays a cold-hearted woman.The film is released from Focus Features who had a big year this year with Brokeback Mountain, The Constant Gardener, and Pride and Prejudice. The film did not win the Best Picture Academy Award, getting beat by Crash, which was an amazing film, but it did not deserve to win. Brokeback Mountain is the film of the year that will stand the test of time because it was daring and above all the beauty of what film-making should be.	5.0	The Best Film of the Year!	2006-03-08	45	39	6

"I have to begin by saying that it has been a very long time since I have seen a film with such enormous, emotional intelligence and resonance as this work displays.The scenic quality of the film is utterly, breathtakingly, beautiful and the musical score is every inch as gentle and fragile as the love story it underpins. The lead actors are outstanding, Ennis [Heath Ledger, who gives no hint of his Australisian heritage] is darkly brooding and guarded, damaged as he is by early experiences of poverty, intolerence and fear. Jack [Jake Gyllenhaal] is dramaticly more available, passionate and needs driven than his lover. Their love is a tender and tragic pot-boiler which resonates an aching sense of longing and of both hope and hopelessness. These two young actors express levels of experience and pathos way beyond achievements their ages would suggest an aptitude for, being actually 25 and 24 respectively. Oscar and BAFTA nominations and indeed wins, simple must be in the offing for both. It has echoes of films like ""Far from Heaven"", in which Julianne Moore battles with social order versus desire, longing, want and love.Utterly beautiful both physically and emotionally and a film which has much to document about the power of love and attraction and the destruction of hatred and bigotry.As stunning an interpretation of Annie Proulx's delightful novella, as it would be possible to produce.A certain and indelable, must see of a film."	5.0	A beautifully arranged Masterpiece.	2006-01-30	20	16	4

Everyone's gushing over how CONTROVERSIAL this film is (it isn't, merely just another pretentious, boring excuse for the Hollywood establishment to pat itself on the back) or how accomplished Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall's acting is (it isn't, unless you consider constant mumbling profound and affecting in some way). Others rave about Ang Lee's beautiful portrayal of the American West, and it is certainly nice, but merely window dressing.Apparently many are dissappointed that this got turned down from Best Picture, granted instead to the equally manipulative and shallow Crash. Truth is, neither deserved the win. I can think of several 2005 pictures (Munich, Lord Of War, Serenity, A History Of Violence) off the top of my head that were far more watchable and interesting than this steaming, self-congratulatory pile. Of course, as far as ""Westerns"" go gimme A Fistful Of Dollars or Once Upon A Time In The West any day."	1.0	A VERY IMPORTANT MOVIE!!!11	2006-04-02	74	27	47
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AI6GZ3K0QRQ0X	Sidney L. Vaught	"This is an unfortunate day where ""Brokeback Mountain"" takes on a new level of sadness with the death of Heath Ledger.  While Ledger's performance is superb, I believe he merely scratched the surface of his talent here.I wish Heath Ledger could have gone on to make more movies where he could explore the emotional depths as he did in this film.  It is sad for us we'll never know.I don't have many modern favorite films, actually most of the films coming out today are such brain-fodder, in my opinion, I don't feel they're worth the time to sit through them.  However; ""Brokeback Mountain"" is one of my favorite films.  I saw it twice in the theatre and bought the DVD the first day it came out.  Even when I'm channel surfing on TV and I see ""Brokeback Mountain"" listed on the on-screen cable guide, I usually end up going to that channel and then watch the rest of the movie from whereever I happen to come in on.Rest Peacefully, Heath, and Thank You."	5.0	Brokeback Mountain Takes On New Meaning Today	2008-01-23	32	29	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2RAU617VTJMBX	Sigrid Macdonald	I really enjoyed this movie but I don't understand why it was considered to be so spectacular. Firstly, I found the first 40 minutes to be really boring. That's probably because I don't like Westerns and I'm not thrilled with cowboys. The dialogue between the cowboys -- two men with seriously limited communication skills! -- was painful at times since so little was said verbally. Obviously, that was done deliberately to depict the personalities of the men and the acting was stellar in that department.After about 45 minutes, the movie really picked up for me. It was a heart-wrenching love story, compounded by the fact that so many people got hurt when two men who loved each other married women instead and fathered children.Cinematography was fantastic and in general, I liked it very much but personally, I wouldn't have voted in for best picture.	4.0	Very good but	2006-05-26	31	15	16

Both try so hard to do what life expects them to be.  The women in this film are very talented actresses and I cry for their characters as well.  Society's rules throw these two men into a life of sadness and want for no good reason.  This film is beautifully done and the scenery is breathtaking.  It is a gift to the world.  As a straight white married women I learned that gay love is as powerful and beautiful as mine is for my husband.  I learned so much.  Love and acceptance is what Jack Twist and Ennis DelMar wanted and that is all they wanted.  I cry for them.Silk	5.0	Breathtakingly Beautiful	2006-03-21	44	35	9
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AGJLDMVGPMBV8	Simon Foster	I watched Brokeback Mountain with Natasha my girlfriend last night. She had already seen it in the cinema when it came out, and ordered it as soon as it was available on DVD. It is a beautifully shot look at the way wandering cowboys worked and the often harsh life they lead. It's amazing to think that the story is set as recently as the 1960s since it almost feels as though it was set in the nineteenth century. The landscape itself has a timeless quality. The soundtrack was particularly haunting, certainly moving my girlfriend Natasha to tears in several places.	4.0	Interesting	2006-06-15	33	26	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ARUMQ2CGJR3WL	"Skeptyk ""Skeptyk"""	"Okay, as a queer rights activist, I was interested in all the hoopla about it, but as a disability rights activist, I rarely go see a film that has no closed captioning (much less a description track).  Also, I am usually bored by love stories, tragic or comedic.  For such reasons I did not see this film until yesterday.I loved the music. The film was pretty dull. I am glad it sparks some more discussions, and if it opens more folks up to justice and kindness, that is wonderful.  But as a movie...eh.  Lovely vistas, barely drawn characters, sturdy livestock, and another couple of stock Hollywood gay characters. (Hollywood gays have come in two main types for about a century: Asexual witty/bitchy style-focused queen or occasionally manly martyr.)Spoilers ahead.Ennis was a right jerk.  He was a jerk to Jack, to his kids, to Alma and to himself. The notion that he was hurting and confused sucks, but it is no excuse. When Alma suggests birth control, he takes her responsible query as an insult. She doesn't even confront him with his affair with Jack until after they are divorced, and when she does, Ennis assaults her - when she's pregnant!The stifling atmosphere of the closet was well-presented, and the pervasiveness. Jack's wife was in the closet, unable to be honest about how Jack died; Alma seemingly had no one to share her knowledge of Ennis' decades-long affair; Jack's parents clearly knew more about Jack than they were willing to say: his dad was full of resentment for his dead son, and his mom had to be sneaky in her grief. Her scene of sharing the truth with Ennis in the only way either dared, with eyes and careful words, was one of the most depressing and brave scenes in the film. The tension was scary, as I waited for Jack's dad to haul off and hit someone, most likely his wife, to prove his manhood.  Those two depressed me more than anyone else in the movie.But, all in all, it was another tragic love story, another case where the lovers could only meet rarely and out of sight. As romantic as such episodes can be, I keep thinking that, like so many of these tragic love tales, marriage may not have worked for them. One would squeeze the toothpaste tube ""wrong"", one would leave his underwear on the sofa, one would resent the other for emotional distance, different parenting techniques, money issues, jealousy....all the usual crap couples in the world face. Homophobia is only one of the pressures gay couples have to deal with.Torch Song Trilogy, a quarter century ago,  was more groundbreaking than this, in that it showed gay couples actually living together, in the world.  The exotic aloneness of the Ennis and Jack Brokeback interludes, like so many secret trysts of folks having affairs, easily blinds people to how completely contrived and otherwordly the interludes are.The main tragedy is not that these these guys could not be a rancher couple, openly married, the tragedy was that they could not explore any number of options. Ang Lee gave us little of any of these characters.  Maybe that was deliberate, so folks could project multiple things onto them?  Maybe this allows folks to see many different movies.I know I felt choked at the end, not with tears, but with the dust of many dried up lives.  Jack was the juiciest one in the film, the one with the most life. And he was killed just when he was going to live maybe a bit more openly, on a ranch, with a man.  By Hollywood formula, he had to die.Yawn."	3.0	Yawn	2006-04-09	45	13	32

It shows that true love can be found anywhere.  I didn't like the ending, I know they like to keep you wondering at the end of a movie.  This just left too much up in the air I suppose. It definately was a tear jerker.  The experience at the theater did not go as well.  Watched several people walk out during the movie, and actually someone walked to the front right infront of the screen and yelled ""you people really want to watch these f#*&%*#?""  I could not believe it, with all the talk everyone had to have known it was a gay oriented movie before they paid to see it."	5.0	Intense	2006-02-01	12	5	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2PJUHR9LD9XKZ	Skywalker	"Many beautiful pictures, good music and a melancholy plot, but not much more... was my first impression. Until a scene quite at the beginning of the film came back to my mind where Jack tells Ennis that his parents are ""Pentecostals"" and the born and raised Methodist Ennis asks him what exactly is meant by Pentecost. Jack cannot give him a clear answer, but my impression is now that this is precisely the film's theme.Pentecost was the day when the Holy Spirit came over Jesus' disciples and Maria, so that they became one with Creation and could from then on speak to all people in any kind of language; so to say a reversal of the Babylonian curse which resulted in people no longer managing to communicate. The surprising and beautiful part in ""Brokeback Mountain"" is that during the months they spend there together Ennis and Jack indeed find a common language, one that goes beyond friendship and sex. This also explains why both their marriages fail, because for whatever reason, with their wives they can never be themselves as they do with one another, find understanding without words, share everything that matters. There are never such simple gestures of trust and tenderness between them and their women as Ennis and Jack find when they are together.Ang Lee's directing style is very quiet and subtle; ""Brokeback Mountain"" is not your typical US-American blockbuster presenting a moral on a silver plate. Before I watched the film I had read up in more than one source that the film's theme was to find an excuse for why these men ""become gay""; how they are ""left alone in nature and loneliness"" in the mountains until their natural drives overcome them because they are alone for months without a woman nearby, and that afterwards they cannot stop sinning once they started it. I guess that was a conventional do-gooder interpretation wanting to say ""poor boys, it's not their fault if they get seduced, and afterwards they are contaminated and can no longer find fulfilment in a normal marriage""... A very foolish interpretation in my eyes. I cannot believe that any man who is 100 % straight would start an affair with another man after a few weeks only on account of ""certain physical needs"" (apart from the fact that they both have to work hard and do not have much physical energy left to begin with); neither does this explain why they should share kisses and caresses.As far as I know no one until now has ever managed to solve the riddle as to why two people fall in love with one another, but a blind man can see that Jack and Ennis are in love head over heels. Ennis will need by far a longer period to accept that Jack is and always will be the most important person in his life, but when they first separate for an indefinite time he already breaks down as if someone had torn his heart from his chest.In the end ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a western, and friendship and companionship between men is a central matter in almost all western stories; this film merely has the courage to take the friendship one step further.It is a great love story, no sociocritical piece or plea for minorities. And though it is very melancholy, at the end it leaves the viewer to himself and the question how many people living on this planet (many of whom probably like to spend their time bashing gay people) not only never experience such communication and mutual language with another person, but probably also spend their lives searching for it in vain."	5.0	What does Pentecost mean...?

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AVN00ASBFTMN6	Smoking Ace	"For many days now I have lingered on this film. I recently rented it off of Netflix, and I was stunned by how much it moved me. For the longest time I avoided seeing this film, because I was afraid of how I would feel about it. Not for it's subject matter, I have sat through and enjoyed many gay themed films. I feared more that this was just another over-hyped oscar winning dissapointment, Like so many other oscar winners over the past few decades. Personally I was deeply moved by this film.  There are very many lessons to be learned from Brokeback Mountain. Not necessarily about homosexuality, but about the nature of love itself. Brokeback Mountain makes you realize how powerful a force like love is. It can create such beauty and passion. Yet at the same time destroy lives with the intensity of a furious hurricane. The main thing I liked about the picture, is that it doesn't take sides. Every character in this film is a victim. Jack and Ennis are both lonely and miserable, while Alma and Lureen have to suffer through infidelity and loveless marriages. They could have easily turned this film into a mockery of itself, although people make fun of it anyway, it never made a wrong turn for me.The performances are revolutionary. I really agree with people who put Heath Ledger's performance up there with Brando. He completly embodied Ennis Del Mar, the way Charlize Theron embodied Aileen Wurnos in ""Monster. The moment where he breaks down in the alleyway after Jack left just really tears you up. Saying that, I have to say as great as Jake Gyllenhaal was in this film, I did think he was bit overshadowed by Ledger. But I really loved the way that you could guess what he was feeling just from his facial expressions. One scene that comes to mind, is the one where he is dancing with Lureen and you can see this sadness in his eyes as he turns away from her, like he is pining for something pining for Ennis.Michelle Williams is an incredible actress, I've seen her in Wendy and Lucy and Synechdoche,NY, and it amazes me that she hasn't gotten more recognition then she's already recieved, the moment when she see's Ennis from the porch she shows such a genuine reaction.This was also a huge breakout movie for Anne Hathaway, who before had only been known for playing disney princesses.Out of all the films Ang Lee has directed this is probably my favorite of his, or at least tied with The Ice Storm. It amazes me how versatile  he continues to be from doing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to Sense & Sensibility. I recently heard that he was set to do the Film adaptation of ""Life of Pi"" and if it is anywhere as good as this adaptation of Annie Proulx's story(which is worth a look) then I will be eternally grateful."	5.0	Achingly beautiful and profound.	2010-01-27	11	11	0

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A26A64X86VL1R4	Snowbrocade	Ang Lee's film is groundbreaking in that it is a mainstream movie that portrays passion between two men.  The story begins when two farm boys, Ennis and Jack, meet while herding sheep on isolated Brokeback Mountain.  The job is for the summer and they must camp out with the sheep.  They share the stories of their love deprived  childhoods and on a cold night they end up sharing a tent.  They make love and develop a passionate bond.  Taciturn Ennis is nearly incapable of revealing, let alone talking, about his feelings to the more demonstrative Jack.Over the next twenty years or so, Jack and Ennis meet for fishing trips and to renew their passion.  Both are married with children in their attempts to fit in to the demands of culture. Jack is able to express his dissatisfaction with being apart from his true love and repeatedly suggests that he and Ennis get a ranch together.  Ennis is barely able to talk about this, let alone allow himself to be with Jack.This film creates an atmosphere of love and longing, while unflinchingly showing the lack of acceptance by mainstream culture of alternate lifestyles.  The scenic splendour of nature is filmed with haunting clarity.  This provides an element of nature, almost as another character in the film, acting as a neutral witness to human passion.  Gyllenhaal and Ledger are touching and beautiful in their roles.  The supporting actresses playing their wives, Michelle Williams and Ann Hathaway, provide accurate and devastating performances.	4.0	Expand your conception of romance.	2006-08-21	32	29	3

After seeing this movie on Yahoo's box office chart for ages, I've decided to watch its trailer, and wept.I went to watch BM the day after the Academy Awards, and felt that for me, it was the best film of the year. Although the movie was based on a short story, they've enriched the characters so much that made you felt like you've loved for a lifetime as well.What surprised me the most was that although I went in to the movie with my own expectations and thoughts about some scences, while watching the movie, I did not once find myself thinking and analyzing.  The emotions seeped out from the screen in waves and circled me into its realm, and I appreciate this element very much. I walked out of the theater feeling that I understood a bit more about how others live, have lived, and that particular sentiment will not be forgotten easily.Ang Lee said he only wanted to make a love story.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2HNIMV9LJ9VIF	Soul Searcher	"I hate films like this. It is very moving and it feels very heavy. I didn't know I was that deep watching until I realized that I was in tears with Ennis in the scene when Jack said to him, ""I wish I knew how to quit you."" To which he replied, ""Why don't you just let me be? It's because of you, Jack, that I am like this."" The feeling-- it cannot be described. Love-- it's the force that stops you, sets you free, makes you somebody, makes you a nobody, makes you see things, makes you blind, gives you hope.I burst into tears again upon seeing ""DECEASED"" stamped on the returned postcard Ennis sent for Jack. I couldn't stop my tears even after the ending credits of the film. It made me think of the things that I should have done. It made me reflect on what factors should I base my life's big decisions on-- friends? Town folks? Tradition? Family? Happiness? Love? I certainly hope that it's not too late... For a movie that has no ""specific message"" to convey, Brokeback Mountain gave me lots of thoughts about life and love, and surely, it renewed my hope. ""I swear...""...(Two weeks and a few days later...)..Brokeback Mountain had me write what I have written above (originally posted on April 12, 2006, unedited, useful to 54/62) right after seeing the movie for the first time. That was my initial reaction. I was greatly moved by the movie and I was inspired to write. Under the influence of such overwhelming emotion, I even wrote some spoilers (my apologies). Brokeback Mountain-a movie about two cowboys who falls in love with each other in the early 60's amidst the conservative, religious and strict society-is such a great film that motivates people. Seeing other people's reviews here makes me shed some tears because I completely understand their feelings in what they have written. It made me feel like doing something about it. I am not a writer so I could not make a good review of the film. But for me, a good film is not about how big the production was. It's not about the monetary budget. It's not about the stunts. It's not about the special effects. It's all about telling a good story and how that story reaches the heart and mind of the audience. How the movie affects people-that's the way I evaluate a film. This ""review"" basically reveals how the movie left me a lasting impression.I liked the whole movie but there are others who question some parts of the movie, like, the growing love between Ennis and Jack in the mountains was not evidently shown. I would say that these people missed that part. The conception of the love between Ennis and Jack was clearly developed and was even symbolized by the scenery. The mountains, the sheep, the weather, the rivers, all of these are not just serving as natural background. They are also symbolic. Director Ang Lee used them to symbolize the passage of time and how Ennis and Jack were spending their time together. The grandness of the landscape and the simplicity of the sheep in the area controlled by cowboys also symbolized our big world and the little souls living in it constrained by the society's norms and values.By the time the guys came down from the mountains, Ennis was (another spoiler?) already deeply in love with Jack. This was shown in the scene when they went on to their own separate ways-when Jack was already gone, Ennis began sobbing in an alley and hitting the wall. This was a perfect illustration of his love left undisclosed to Jack. Why the sobbing? Because of a true love which was ""not supposed to be."" I should know-I wounded my fist when I was in the same predicament some years ago. I still have the scars on my knuckles.I had mixed emotions happening at the same time in some parts throughout the movie. Especially when Ennis and Jack was first reunited. While I was deeply sympathetic with Alma looking over the window at Ennis and Jack getting in the pickup, at the same time I was also happy for the two guys being together again. Proving that their love for each other still exist after all those years.As others mentioned that this movie was slow and too long, I tried to watch it for the nth time on DVD, and I skipped some scenes. It didn't work for me. Ang Lee knows what he was doing. Some scenes were thoughtfully placed here and there to break the tension and the emotion building inside the viewer. That's the reason why some people find this boring. However, as the movie ends, the emotion reaches to its climax. And at the last frame of the film, you would not want it to end. That's how I felt.This movie is brilliant, if not perfect. However, if I am brutally forced to find something wrong about it, I can think of one scene. That is when Aguirre came over to tell Jack about his sick uncle. Jack was chopping wood into pieces with the axe. He positioned a piece of wood on the chopping table then turned around to face Aguirre. They talked in close up shots. When Aguirre left and Jack turned back to the chopping table, the piece of wood was already gone and so he was picking up another piece of wood instead. Who moved the wood? Irrelevant, but I call it ""the vanishing wood"" scene. But hey, that's just a needle in the hay.Not a fan of any of the performers but I think the characters in the movie were all believable. Anne Hathaway-although I didn't believe her appearance, her acting showed that she's grown from being a cute princess to an actress. Michelle Williams-if only her role was a little longer, the best actress award was hers. Jake Gyllenhaal-way, way up higher than I expected. Heath Ledger-he created an unforgettable character whose silent and mostly non-verbal expressions of internal conflict and pain shouts an ocean deep of emotion. My choice for best actor (over the guy who imitated another person who talks a lot and that talking just seemed to cover up what lacked in the acting itself).A peaceful movie with a more universal theme should have won the best picture at the Oscars (especially if this organization is trying to impress the world as the leading and ""international"" film award giving body) instead of the one that I find ""too American."" I find Brokeback Mountain as having a more widespread but ignored theme, more applicable to more people's lives in different societies across the globe. The lead actors did a great, convincing job that if I happen to meet them personally I'm afraid that I would give them a big hug in tears, still believing that they are the doomed Ennis and Jack.The simple yet powerful music is not to be ignored as it enhanced the dramatic scenes of the movie. And what else can I say? Brokeback Mountain is too good that every time I watch it, it always penetrates into my heart. I hate that. I don't want to be vulnerable. I am a guy, and ""it should not be."" So what exactly is the message that we are looking for here? Nothing specifically. It's out there in the open. If this movie is not a love story, then what is it? If the theme is not universal enough, then what is? In other words, this movie offers a lot of meaningful interpretation. Have an open mind, see this movie and let your heart find the right answer for you."	5.0	Too good. I hate it.	2006-04-27	86	76	10
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A37AV0MSYOEAPP	spackar	I rarely watch movies which are love stories/romance films. In general they do not interest me. However Brokeback Mountain is an exception. It is truly poignant and touching. It is also refreshing to see bisexual/gay men portrayed as masculine. In the majority of movies and TV shows homosexual men are portrayed as effeminate queens. I know that many gay men in real life are effeminate. However for every queen there is also a masculine man who happens to be homosexual. The friendship and love between Ennis and Jack is palpable in this film. The trajedy of the societal constraints which keep them apart is achingly portrayed. My only criticism of the book and therefore the film is that they should have made it more clear that Ennis was bicurious long before he met Jack, and therefore was susceptible to Jack's advances. The sudden, unexplained way they first have sex and begin their love affair is unrealistic and not believable.	4.0	A Truly Heartbreaking Love Story	2010-12-02	2	1	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ	speed_on_wheelz	I can't begin to summarize this movie.  The plot was so boring; I can't believe I didn't fall asleep during the film.  I didn't even understand a word Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were saying.  They were mumbling.  At the beginning of the movie, the setting was beautiful, but as soon as a word was spoken, everything went downhill.  Anne Hathaway played a good part.  Her role progressed as the movie went on.  Yes, there are a couple sex scenes with Gyllenhaal and Ledger, but it was totally pointless.  They weren't even gay in the movie.  They just wanted sex; didn't matter from who.  This movie also stars Linda Cardellini (Velma from Scooby-Doo 1 and 2) and Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1, 2, 3, and now 4).  I couldn't believe it when I saw Anna Faris.  When I saw her I'm like `is that the girl from Scary Movie?'  Same comment for Linda Cardellini.  I really expected more from this movie, but instead I was very disappointed.  I just can't believe this got nominated for an Oscar.	1.0	Brokeback Mountain	2006-02-11	156	35	121

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A17MYNBVVGS7MQ	"stellanoctis ""Film Studies"""	First, let me say that this movie moved me in a way I didn't think was possible.  It reminded me of when I was 15 and saw Grave of the Fireflies for the first time, after which I bawled for hours.Brokeback Mountain is a modern Greek tragedy.  There is the rise and fall of characters, the conflict between duty and desire, the pathos and the carthatic ending.  With all of these elements are an absolutely amazing cast, particularly Heath Ledger, whom I never have cared for and now respect greatly.  The passion between Jack and Ennis moves from understated and sensuous to fiery and palpable.  The instrumental score is gorgeous--truly full of heart.And the best part?  The dialogue and action are practically word for word from the original story.  The only difference is the added scenes, which stem from references the characters make in the stories (birth of a son, Mexico trip, etc.).  Annie Proulx writes on her website that she feels lucky to have her story adapted so beautifully.A lot of guys I know won't go because they feel their masculinity is threatened.  Our illustrious President will not comment on the movie.They are wrong.This is a stunning, gritty, beautiful, moving film.  It's amazing what Ang Lee has done, how bold yet delicate the love story is--how realistic--how tragic.  How human.	5.0	Coming to Terms with a Tragedy	2006-01-26	26	21	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AGMW3I34INNYG	Stephen Cannon	To say that Brokeback Mountain is a bold film may seem like a foregone conclusion for some.  I was surprised by how the film handles its subject - two rugged cowboys dealing with the fact that they have fallen in love with each other - considering that this may be the most boldly gay film to be released in mainstream American cinema.Heath Ledger is Ennis Del Mar, a classic movie cowboy.  Ennis is very much a man's man.  He doesn't speak much; he takes as much pleasure from working than most anything else; and he likes to unwind with a cigarette and some whiskey at the end of the day.  Jack Twist, played by Jake Gyllenhall, is a would-be rodeo cowboy, although he's not very good at it.  Jack daydreams and hopes to achieve his vision of bullriding success.  The two are paired together on a job tending sheep on a mountain (yes, Brokeback Mountain) in Wyoming in the summer of 1963.  One of them is to sleep high up near the sheep, while the other camps at the base of the mountain to guard the flock from other threats.  One night after a little too much whiskey, the two find themselves in the same tent, and awkwardly they act on their confused feelings for each other.  This scene is one of the most uncomfortable scenes in film, although this seems to be the intent.  These two don't know how to act out these feelings, and what's more, they know that society tells them that it's wrong.  Nonetheless, they continue to indulge themselves.  When the summer ends, they attempt to go back to 'normal.'  Ennis is getting married (to real life love Michelle Williams), and not long after he has two girls in close proximity to each other.  Jack meets a cute Rodeo girl (Anne Hathaway) who falls for him, and they in turn get married.  They have a son, but for Jack and Ennis, they can never replace what they had with each other.This film is difficult on many levels.  Those who are uncomfortable with homosexuality will not want to see this movie.  As a straight man who has known several gay men, I found much of this movie a little awkward at least.  The emotions feel real, though, and there is a real sensitivity to what these men might have gone through.  The acting from all four principals is very good, and Ang Lee's directing is perfect; he knows when to be subtle and when to pour it on.  Great film, but be ready to struggle with your own emotions here.  Final grade - A	5.0	Haunting, uncomfortable movie is done with heart	2006-01-30	29	27	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AGRR05FH945HR	Steven Cain	Bravo, to all the fine men and women, gay and straight, who have stood up for this beautiful movie.While there have been many excellent movies about relationships between men, they have often been semi-obscure art movies. With Brokeback Mountain, we are seeing the same level of intelligence and sensitivity in a mainstream movie. The fact that the two main characters are cowboys, a traditionally masculine image, makes this all the more powerful. Yes, you can be gay and macho at the same time.This is a long overdue, stereotype-breaking movie. While this was initially set in the early sixties, we still live in a society in which there are definite limits to 'acceptable conduct', based on gender. Even today, if two men greeted each other with a kiss in a supermarket setting, the way women often do, they would be seen as nancy boys. Traditionally, men are only allowed to be affectionate with each other on the sports field or on the battlefield.Full marks to the writer, the cast, and Ang Lee above all for their courage and vision.	5.0	It's about time...	2006-04-02	52	45	7
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3504GGQYJMYIC	Steven L. Garrett	Charity: The RodeoI am a Gay Cowboy and proud! When I found out about the movie I was in class at college and went to the website to check it out and save the page to my external drive for opening at home, while also listening to the preview music. I couldn't wait to get the movie as it's a 'true' story about love - a 'love that has no boundaries'! Knowing how full of hate so many religious cult followers have, I knew they would put it down, and at the same time it came out, I was residing in a so-called 'christian' home where there was nothing but hate, greed, self-servitude, deceit, drugs, and more! Now isn't it sad how many of these fundamentalists put down anyone who is different or better, yet are savages themselves?When it finally came out in the theaters I was still at that 'place of hate' and so anxious to see it, but not only had I been keeping my personal life and feelings to myself, as well as my opinion - especially when it came to wanting to stand up for my own people - but I had to 'hide' my enthusiasm when I 'snuck' out the door after giving a line about seeing some other movie while getting the third degree about Brokeback Mountain being at the same theater! I won't tell what was said, but maybe you can imagine! Sad how ugly this guy was and how much 'hate' he had within!I was so excited when I got to the theater and could barely wait for the movie to begin, while the theater was also packed with a mixture of folks, as well as nationalities! I watched the movie and wanted to see it again as it really told the 'truth' of life on the range, though many 'homophobic' fundamentalists will always deny that something so true would ever be right or accepted as far as they're concerned!When it ended I was not the only one in tears! While a few patrons left, there were those of us who stayed to the very end of the credits while sharing amongst one another their many different feelings about the movie, as well as the way it ended, which was so sad, but true! Breeders and teachers of hate will always be around, and though education helps in many cases, sheep or religious followers who are so full of hate will 'never' change unfortunately! When I got back home I not only had to hide my enthusiasm about the movie, but also had to lie about what I had seen at the theater knowing what would happen if I told the truth! I'd of been on the streets looking for another place to live!When the movie finally arrived I watched it several times and each time cried for both of them, but especially for Jake's character! When you fall in love with someone and are willing to give up your own life for that person, yet they turn their back on you out of fear or not sure if that's what they really want, it can destroy the other person in so many ways! A lot of Jake's character was like me and I could 'feel' his hurt to the point that I forgot it was a movie and wanted so much to comfort him! I am like Jake's character in so many ways, while wishing some day of having a Ranch of my own, or by proxy, while at the same time wishing I had the money to buy land and build a Ranch somewhere here or near the Antelope Valley here in California. Then, it was a place for myself where I could create movies, since I now know about video design and more thanks to one of my classes at Antelope Valley College, but now it would be an 'Intentional Community Ranch' where other folks who could enjoy life on a Working Ranch and Movie Studio would be most welcome to live!With so many fundamentalist sectarian religious cults out there that breed and spread nothing but hate, while there's so few places where folks could go and 'be themselves', the Ranch is a dream and goal that I am reaching for, while in part, would be a dedication to other Cowboys and Cowgirls who are not so 'mainstream' and 'stereotyped', but who share a love of togetherness and community! I also admire Ang Lee for what he did with this 'true' movie of shared love between two Cowboys and though I'll never meet him or another guy I admire who is Huell Houser, one day I hope to also create movies similar to either Brokeback Mountain, or even documentaries like what Huell does on his many journeys!I highly recommend Brokeback Mountain for everyone out there who really wants to know the truth and not hype from fundamentalists that being different and unique just doesn't fit into society - their society!	5.0	Love Has No Boundaries ..... but don't say that to a fundamentalist sectarian religious fanatic!	2009-01-31	13	11	2
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A359IT81FBX64Y	Steven Mason	"I resisted watching this film. At first I assumed it was a gimmick: a mainstream movie featuring ""breakthrough"" love scenes between gay men. Then I thought it would be too serious and depressing, with pain and misery on all sides. I was wrong on both counts, and Brokeback turns out to be the best movie of the year.But I wasn't completely wrong. It is a breakthrough film, and there is pain and misery, but the quality of the story, the script, and the acting rise above everything else and come across as true, compelling, and universal. Brokeback is not about gay love; it's not about forbidden love; it's not about star-crossed love. It's about accepting people for who they are and the joy of a true bond of love.I thought the love scenes might be a little off-putting, but they were genuinely touching. For Ennis and Jack, it wasn't just about sex; more important was the emotional freedom and trust they allowed each other, so they could open up to happiness rather than suffer in loneliness. Affection was easier for Jack, and it was especially heart-warming to see Ennis emerge from his shell.Brokeback is a bittersweet tale of the redeeming power of love, as well as the sometimes desperate struggle for love and against loneliness."	5.0	No gimmick - the real thing	2006-01-29	1	1	0
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A349CGNOQ5CUDP	"Steven Pinkston ""Steven Pinkston"""	For me, this movie was disappointing.  I have to give credit to the actors, they did an excellent job.  But I do feel that the relationship between the two characters, Jack and Enis, was a bit...rushed into.  I mean, how do you go from tending sheep...to sex.  There wasn't even the slightest show of interest between the two guys, except maybe in one scene.  It just didn't flow well enough there for me.However, the rest of the movie was decent.  It goes on to show the struggle of the characters being forced to deny their love and to be apart (except the occasional visits), and managing wives and families.  Then, to top it all off, the ending really sucked.  I actually baught the movie  before seeing it in good faith that it was going to be beyond my expectations.  I gave the dvd away a day or so later.So overall, i'd say this movie's entertaining, but nothing special.  The actors diserve every award/nomination that was given as a result of this film.  But as for the movie itself, at best, it's decent enough maybe to rent from your local movie store.	2.0	Decent enough for rental	2008-05-25	16	5	11
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AL277B4AQCWBG	Steven Reynolds	"In the summer of 1963, ranch hand Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet and fall in love while working in isolation on Brokeback Mountain. At summer's end, Ennis marries his fiancee Alma (Michelle Williams), while Jack goes back to the rodeo. Four years later, after his own marriage to Lureen (Anne Hathaway), and both men have children, Jack initiates a reunion. The twenty-year secret relationship between the two men has shattering consequences for their marriages and lives... Simply put, this is a love story. For those worried about seeing a gay-themed film, rest assured that there is nothing sordid nor confronting about the depiction of the physical relationship (much to the disappointment of the Religious Right who've tried to demonize this film as a Trojan horse for mainstreaming ""deviant"" porn). Rather, the whole thing is done with such subtlety and dignity that you cannot help but feel for Jack and Ennis, irrespective of your own orientation. Heath Ledger is especially good, giving a performance that's astonishing for the way it communicates so much with so little. The film is worth seeing for him alone.My only criticism is the pacing. There are long stretches of this film where very little of substance happens. Some parts are agonizingly dull. Those who've seen the film numerous times disagree, arguing that every scene, every shot, is filled with layers of symbolism and resonant meaning. So perhaps this is a film you need to see several times to appreciate fully.The film has attracted a fair amount of predictably irate and thoughtless criticism from those cribbing their remarks from ""The Celluloid Closet"" and arguing that this is ""just another one of those films"" that characterizes all homosexual relationships as necessarily tragic and impossible. Get a grip. This isn't 2006. It's the 1960s. In Texas and Wyoming. Notwithstanding that context, from the moment Jack and Ennis connect, the possibility of some kind of life together is constantly on offer as far as Jack is concerned - all Ennis has to do is say he wants it. It's his inability to choose that possible life, rather than his desire for it, that makes this story a tragic one."	4.0	An original love story told with dignity, tenderness and grace	2006-02-05	3	2	1

It doesn't matter if it's two men it is love between two people and caring for someone is a wonderful thing to find in life as so many never truely do. If it had been different time in our history these two men could have been together instead of having their relationship in the shadows.Sadly even today many men do that and even ones whom are married to a woman all becuase this country is still far behind the world in accepting anyone and everyone for who they are and that loving another really holds no boundries as is often the case with narrow minded people or people of extreme religious beliefs.However, it is America and we are all free to think and feel what we want.	5.0	A Wonderful Love Story	2008-04-01	10	9	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A20EH9N3UKRGHJ	"Sue Ann Jaffarian ""Mystery Author"""	"I saw this movie long after its initial release and was quickly sorry it had taken me so long to get to it. This is a beautiful, powerful and heartbreaking story of Ennis and Jack, two men who fall in love in the early 60's in rural America. But while Jack sees a possible life with Ennis, the reserved and troubled Ennis only sees a future fraught with danger and misery (he was forced to view the body of a murdered gay man when he was a boy.  Instead, they go on to live within the boundaries of ""traditional"" relationships, only to experience frustration, pain and unhappiness, living for patches of love and joy during the few times they are able to get together over the years.While Brokeback Mountain is about two men who experience a gripping and overwhelming physical and emotional love for each other, it could have also been about an interracial couple, or any other type of ""taboo"" coupling of people, during the same time period.  This movie isn't about being gay. It's about people sacrificing their own happiness to conform, and finding out too late they should have taken the risk of following their hearts.Story aside, the movie is also beautifully filmed and directed, and the acting is top rate.  Heath Ledger gives an unforgettable performance as the troubled and fearful Ennis."	5.0	Incredibly Touching and Beautiful - Shouldn't be Missed!	2006-05-26	37	33	4

They are great friends and I don't see anything wrong with who they want to spend their life with. Because I feel so strong about gay man I knew I would like this movie before seeing it. I wasn't wrong, this is a great love story. Yes I said Love Story. It doesn't have to be about a man and a woman to make it a love story. This movie is about two man who worked together on Brokeback Mountain alone one year. One night they had sex together. One feels like he did wrong and the other is in love. After their job was done at Brokeback Mountain they both went on with their life. Getting married and having children. They both found each other again and every so months they got together to show their love for each other. I don't believe there was any more sex scenes but you can see how much they care for each other. SO NO THIS MOVIE IS NOT A GAY PORN MOVIE. Like someone wrote on here.

I didn't think the movie would be as powerful as the story, but I was wrong-- it is every bit as haunting, heart-breaking, and darkly beautiful. This story isn't just about a love affair between gay men. It has a deeper message and meaning that is as powerful and clear to me as a lightning bolt. In essence, it's a story about how we choose to live our lives. Do we live the life we think is ""right"" even if it wasn't meant for us (and suffer in silence for years), or do we follow our hearts for a chance at happiness? I find it sad that so few of us do the latter, though it's certainly a much harder path. Still, there are risks, consequences, and sacrifices either way that none of us can predict. Though I'm a woman married to a man, I see so much of myself in Ennis, and I'm making a conscious effort not to be like him. I want to live life authentically, and in a way that will cause the least amount of regret. This, I think, is the hardest thing we as humans may ever have to do.

I will never be able to look at a guy in a cowboy hat the same way. The only criticism I have of the movie was that the male heteros seemed pretty one dimensional.

At first, the movie seems slow but little by little the characters and setting just draw you in. There isn't any escape from this film, once it has grabbed your soul it doesn't let go. It doesn't matter that this is about 2 men who fall deeply in love. It matters that 2 people love. Seeing the anguish and knowing they are living on borrowed time, for those short interludes of love, the pain they feel leaves a palpable pain in your heart. Even thinking about this movie, I get the same feeling of hopelessness and the desire to see a different ending. This movie is painful in its beauty and substance. It is by far one of the best films I have had the privilege of viewing. My one and only complaint was that it ended too soon. I left the theatre sobbing and humbled by two men who could portray such a strong passion for each other despite the odds.

Gay beatings do happen here (Matthew Shepard)and there are many homophobes here. Homosexuality is a taboo and Ennis had realistic thoughts about Jack and himself living together.

I understand what it means to love so deeply and be denied the freedom of expression of that love because of how one is 'expected' to behave.  The concept of this movie (based upon the short story) is so groundbreaking and beautiful that I can honestly say, without having watched the movie itself, that I consider this the best movie of this decade.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3B87UZLPCF0HW	"Tanis ""Tanis Yvonne Somerville"""	Too many people focused on the supposed homosexual content. To my dismay I could not figure out what all the big fuss was about. I emphasised with these characters as I or anyone who has ever been in a relationship could feel their pain. Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the one who wants to throw it all out there and go for it, he's not afraid to say 'I Love You'. Ennis (Heath Ledger) is reserved and can't allow his head to follow his heart. That sounds awfully like traits that heterosexual people have too. Ang Lee does an absolutely fantastic job with his character's development and the astounding scenery in which this all happens. The bond that both of our lead characters have is truly beautiful and pure. 1963, mid America, work is scarce and two farmhands are hired to tend to sheep on a remote mountain. I believe everybody who hasn't seen the film know the rest. The character driven story is held by a tremendous young cast of actors. Gyllenhaal puts himself up there to become a great leading man in Hollywood, Anne Hathaway has become the new Reese Witherspoon and in time assuming she stays on track will become a leading force. Michelle Williams has left James Van Der Beek crying into his Pillow back in Dawson's Creek as she has now come into her own. Finally Heath Ledger, by far one of the most powerful performances he has ever produced. A complex, engrossing portrayal, Ennis presents himself as a more conventional male stereotype than Jack, so the tension between his masculinity and his sexuality is all the more demanding. A career best from nearly the whole cast.	4.0	"""I wish I knew how to quit you???"""	2007-09-15	10	8	2

There are also many great actors, wonderful screenplayers and screenplays, scores, songs and so on. And obviously there are movies - not many - with all those qualities.

Obviously doesn't matter... it's a love story! Annie Proulx had written an extraordinary heart-breaking story! Unforgettable story indeed!I think the best part of the movie is when Ennis and Jack get together after the four-year without seeing each other.

I am what you would call an ardent film buff owning many DVD titles that I'm proud of, so I consider myself a lttle perceptive when it comes to films. When a movie can make you feel an overabundance of emotions it's doing it's job.Brokeback Mountain is about 2 men coming to terms with their sexuality in the early '60's when they meet while herding sheep on a ranch. Their time together also makes them realize their fondness for one another and thus a love affair is born. To me  the greatest love story ever told begins at this point.With beautiful scenery ( the film was shot near Calgary, Alberta, Canada), an excellent script, superb directing by Ang Lee, and wonderful performances especially by Heath Ledger who puts on the greatest performance by an actor I have ever seen, Brokeback Mountain has everything a film should have.It's been many years since a film from Hollywood has explored the sensitive subject of homosexuality. The last film that I saw that was superb in dealing with this was ""Making Love"", and what I like about ""Brokeback"" is that gay men are depicted as normal average Americain men. Also, during the 2 hours no one is going to die from AIDS, no one want's a sex change, and the gay leads are not having sex with an overabundance of guys.Thank you Ang Lee and the other's associated with the making of this film and most of all Heath Ledger; you have made Ennis Del Mar my hero. For the very first time in my life I am proud to be a gay man after viewing your performance."	5.0	"A CLASSIC FILM ONE CAN""T MISS!"	2006-02-26	26	18	8

When watching this classic tale of forbidden love I broke down crying almost 5 times. I did not cry when Bambi's Mother got shot, seeing it at the age of 8 even. I did not cry when Jack died at the end of Titanic. However, I cried when these two men left each other for the first time. I cried when they re-united for the first time. I cried when they cried. I cried when the fought. I cried when they laughed. This movie touches your heart like non-other can. It isn't the fact that their homosexual men but the fact that these two people are deeply in love and cannot possibly end up together. Some might say this movie is ""boring"" and ""slow-moving"" but what do you expect from a culture like this? They have slow paced lives and I am sick and tired of ""epic chase scenes"" and ""intense action."" This movie gives you the joys of being a rancher and a cowboy without all the glitter and the props.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	The Groove	"It's been the butt of many jokes, often told by people who have never seen the movie.  But the truth is, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is an emotionally charged love story directed with maturity, elegance, and grace by Ang Lee.  Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play two men (Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist) who get a gig as shepherds at (where else?) Brokeback Mountain (based in Wyoming but filmed in Alberta).  Their working relationship morphs into a friendship, which takes an intimate turn when Ennis and Jack have a tryst on one cold night.  They swear it's a one-time thing, but in reality, they try to carry on a twenty-year affair unbeknownst to the wives they eventually marry (Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway).  The beauty of ""Brokeback"" is that it doesn't take sides or cast judgement.  Ang Lee lets you feel each of the character's pain, frustration and anxiety.  We sympathize with Jack's longing, and we witness Ennis struggling to balance both a family and the man he so desires.  We also ache with Ennis' wife Alma (Williams), who can't even begin to grasp the words to describe what she sees when she catches her husband kissing another man from her window.  For her, it seems, homosexuality is completely outside her realm of understanding.  But ""Brokeback"" wouldn't stand tall without its performances, which are collectively outstanding.  What's also remarkable is how the screenwriters took the 40-odd-page short story (written by Annie Proux) and stretched it to a movie that runs for over two hours.  Rush-released shortly after the Oscars, this DVD somewhat skimps on the extras (no director's commentary, for instance).  Still, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautifully told movie than lingers in your head long after the final credits roll."	4.0	A Love Stifled by Fear.	2006-04-27	39	28	11
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A20TJ5P97W5MS1	The Inquisitor	What does it take to make a person think differently? Brokeback Mountain is everything you would expect it to be and honestly much more. It is a meditative, thoughtful, well paced & shot, romance. There is a slight chance you may have never watched a love story of this nature before. The two main characters are Ennis Del Mar played by Heath Ledger and Jack Twist played by Jake Gyllenhaal. While these two are on assignment herding sheep in the mountains of Wyoming they discover a similar interest: each other. Brokeback Mountain is a real testament to the fact love can definitely be found in the very unlikeliest of places and between the unlikeliest of people. Love in the traditional sense is not always what we think it is. Overall Brokeback Mountain is a very daring and stereotype destroying outing for all parties involved. Some people may not be interested and others may not be ready. Whether it's your thing or not Brokeback Mountain is a meaningful and enduring film.	5.0	The Empire 5 Star 500 - #85	2011-11-05	8	7	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	"Did anybody honestly believe that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was going to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards last month?Come on, this is a business.They may pick films that most of the country will never see but they're not going to pick a controversial film that'll jeapordize any box office revenue.  The media was focused on the hysterical rage of the gay community that flared up when CRASH was announced as the winner but you could also see the collective sigh of relief filling the auditorium when Nicholson called something other than BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.Despite all the hype and the huge media push, in spite of all the blogs and message boards where gays brag about inflating the box office by seeing the movie a half-dozen times a week (or weekend), I don't think America wants to see this movie.  I live in a blood Red state filled with cowboys and NOT A ONE wanted to see this movie.It's about gay sheepherders.  Or they think they're gay sheepherders, although they keep telling each other they're not.  One wife finds out they're gay...but she doesn't say anything (that's in a perfect world, folks, because I've known wives who found out their husbands were gay and it was a cross between Jerry Springer and Armageddon.  Think about it: would the wives be so understanding if their hubbies were bunking up with a cowgirl?).The movie would've been more interesting if the two cowboys HADN'T been gay but everyone else THOUGHT they were.  They continue on their fishing and riding trips over the years and their families are gossiping and snickering while nothing sexual is happening between them.As it is, re: the fate of these two guys, I was waiting for Monty Python's Church Police to show up and ""arrest Society...since society's to blame!""

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3VAXB8CDYY5BG	The Wingchair Critic	Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' (2005) is certainly a film about a passionate love relationship between two men, but it's equally about loneliness, isolation, lack of self-acceptance, fear, betrayal, the inability to communicate effectively, and the destructive results of broad but deeply ingrained social prejudices.As such, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a film of enormous universal appeal, which no doubt explains why the film is profoundly touching diverse audiences everywhere. Most people, regardless of orientation or background, have experienced some or all of these difficult elements in their own lives.Though not technically perfect, the film actually achieves much more than being a mere exercise in cinematic polish: it is genuinely moving, deeply compassionate, poignant, tender, gripping, and superbly intelligent. 'Brokeback Mountain' is about two men who fall in love with one another in the early 1960s--two people--two human beings. It tells its sometimes unpleasant story in three vibrant dimensions, and, in doing so, casts a soul and a shadow across the screen.'Brokeback Mountain' in also incredibly nuanced in every manner possible--there are more than dozen scenes, both major and minor, which can be broadly interpreted; at least one pivotal scene remains almost entirely open to audience interpretation.The film also gains from repeated viewings, as scene after scene seem to take on new dimensions and meanings.What does the slaughtered sheep Ennis discovers after his initial intimate encounter with Jack symbolize? What else might the sheep's mutilated carcass remind him of? Is Ennis, semi-consciously or unconsciously, planting an idea in Jack's mind when he says he's &#34;had no chance to sin&#34;?Why does Ennis lose control of himself while he and Jack are play-wrestling? Why does Lee choose to frame Ennis against a night sky of exploding fireworks during a Fourth of July celebration? Does Jack's mother invite Ennis up to view Jack's room with a special goal in mind? Why does she nod subtly when Ennis returns to the central room, and have a paper bag waiting for him nearby?Why does Ennis change his mind about attending a pivotal event in his daughter's life in the film's last scene?Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest and most understated performances ever presented in an American film. Note how Ledger doesn't require any dialogue to express Ennis' deeply conflicted, gravely isolated psyche: he conveys it through the manner in which Ennis walks, mumbles, hangs his head, and, in one grim scene, forks his way listlessly through a slice of apple pie in what appears to be an off-hour bus depot.The manner in which Ennis and Jack express their passion for one another is incredibly moving, since their attraction is primarily an expression of emotional desire and deep longing rather than a matter of strictly physical attraction.Jake Gyllenhaal does his best work in the film when illustrating Jack's tenderness for Ennis in three key scenes: on the occasion of their second intimate encounter, on the afternoon they leave the mountain, and during their last meeting; and tenderness expressed between men is a thing rarely seen in American cinema. Additionally, adult love has seldomly been depicted in film as convincingly as it is in 'Brokeback Mountain.'It's probable that the film's brief last line, hauntingly delivered by Ledger, will go down in film history, since it allows Ennis to finally express, as best he is able, everything he has felt for Jack over several decades in three terse, surging, terribly sad words.With the exception of children, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a film for all audiences. It's a grand thing to actually discover a mature, intelligent film that is 'adult' in the best sense of the word, which is also profound and highly enjoyable. 'Brokeback Mountain' has proven to have a kind of healing power over its many of its viewers, and thus is a film all audiences potentially gain from seeing.	5.0	'BrokeBack Mountain' Casts a Shadow Across the Screen	2006-02-08	0	0	0

Seay	"A homosexual affair erupts between two cowboys who, being poor, tough and from the mythological land of the Wild West, defy the stereotypes created by the reactionaries of Fox news as well as liberals of ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"".  The movie portrays the problem of gay romance at a time (the 60s) and place (Wyoming) where such relationships were highly taboo.However, this film is neither intentionally political, nor ideological.  Like all good art, its point is not to moralize, not to take sides, but to capture the complexities of a human situation and cast a light on the personalities involved.  ""Brokeback Mountain"" succeeds in that enterprise.During the film we are swept up by the drama and emotion of the story.  However, it is once we are removed from the movie theaterthat we truly begin to ponder the psychology of Ennis and Jack. We wonder about the history of these two characters and about what was transpiring in their minds at a different level.  We wonder ""What if"".  Two close work colleagues and I spent every spare moment for a week discussing Ennis and Jack (as well as less important characters in the movie) as if they were people we knew.Oscars for this film will bring shrieks from the American Rightand kudos from the Left.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"1963. Two loner cowboys show up at a small office in rural Montana looking for work. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) has worked for Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) before, and knows the routine. Take the flock of sheep up to Brokeback Mountain for the summer, watch over them, keep them safe, and return them at the end of the season. But Jack can't do the job alone and Joe hires Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), a quiet, brooding fellow to run the base camp. Soon, the two men begin a relationship, finding companionship in each other's arms. At the end of the season, Jack thinks that maybe next year, or the year after, they can get a ranch together, and work it, making a nice life for themselves. Ennis is more concerned about public perception and reaction and can't make the jump into a relationship with Jack. Each gets married, Ennis to Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack to Lureen (Anne Hathaway), and starts a family. One day, Jack rolls into town and the two lovers share a romantic weekend. Jack still wants them to run off together and start a ranch, but Ennis seems content to have these occasional weekends as he battles with his feelings about his true love.""Brokeback Mountain"", directed by Ang Lee (""Sense and Sensibility"", ""The Ice Storm"", ""Hulk"") and written by Larry McMurtry (""Lonesome Doves"") and Diana Ossana, based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx, is a very good film, with a lot of great things going for it.Perhaps the best things about the film are the performances by the two leads, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. If you have read any of my reviews of previous Heath Ledger films (""The Brothers Grimm"", ""Lords of Dogtown"", ""A Knight's Tale""), you know I am not a huge fan. But in ""Brokeback"", he is able to create a fully realized character, a character we can believe in and identify with; from the first moments, when he can barely look anyone in the eye, to his gradual acceptance of his partner, to actually talking to Jack we see Ennis develop and grow before our eyes. As the relationship and their lives become more complicated, Ledger helps us understand why Ennis believes the way he does. The relationship he builds with Jack starts as a confused coupling due to need and grows into something more profound and deep, at least through Ennis' eyes. The character is very complicated, and interesting to watch, and a lot of this is due to Ledger's performance. Based on his previous work, I would never have believed he was capable of such a performance. It is intense, interesting and riveting.Jake Gyllenhaal is also very good. Jack seems to be the more accepting member of the couple; he seems to have an inkling of who he is and what he needs, before the night they share in the tent. When that happens, Jack is also concerned and confused, but his love for Ennis allows him to have fantasies of them starting a ranch together. He is clearly disappointed when this doesn't happen, but moves on, getting married to Lureen in the process. Quickly, we see Jack has married Lureen primarily for the lifestyle she affords; her dad owns a large farm equipment dealership. After this point, whenever Jack and Ennis get together for a ""fishing weekend"", it is clear Jack is the better off financially, but his heart is also breaking away because he can't be in a relationship with the man he truly loves. Gyllenhaal's performance is so good because it hints at things we never learn for sure. Has Jack had male partners before? Is Ennis his first love?Director Ang Lee has an impressive resume of films. Each film is very different, yet explores the common theme of a relationship between two people. If you look at his diverse group of films, you realize that he is willing to try to new things and (usually) does them very well. From Jane Austen's England, to New England in the 80s, from modern day San Francisco to modern day New York, he seems to have a real sense for the time and place in each film's narrative. Yes, he did make ""Hulk"", a misguided effort, to say the least, but his other films have been exemplary in every regard. He uses great actors, great writing and great cinematography to fully realize each film. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is no exception. Equally stunning, equally challenging, and very different from his other films.The screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, based on a story by E. Annie Proulx, captures the dialogue of the time and place brilliantly. As mentioned, Ennis doesn't talk a lot and much of his dialogue is grunted, but when he does speak, it is easy to see his speech is subdued by confusion, upbringing and the morals of the day. Jack is more vocal, but also confused. His dreams of living a happy life with Ennis are all the more heartbreaking, because we realize they will never happen. In an interview on NPR, McMurtry and Ossana discussed adapting Proulx's story to the big screen, leaving much of her dialogue and description intact. What they added was an elaboration on the domestic life of Ennis and Jack, detailing what life is like for each when they aren't together. Ennis' life is the more captivating of the two because we recognize how troubled and horrible his life with Alma is. Alma isn't a bad person, but the life they build together is hard to watch. Perhaps the best moment in the film happens when Alma realizes what Jack and Ennis do on those ""fishing trips"".I think the one thing missing for me is any scene depicting the intimacy they share for one another. Their first coupling is more of a `wham, bam, thank you, man' type of encounter, in their tent during a cold night. Later, after they reunite, they kiss forcefully, due to hunger, yearning. Throughout the course of their relationship, which runs twenty years, we see them together a few times, but few of these portray the intimacy they must have shared. Yes, they hug; one scene even shows them in bed together, talking, yet, there seems to be a lack of intimacy. Even in the time and place, despite their confusion, they still manage moments alone, yet we don't really get a sense of the physical side of their love.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a film filled with great performances, outstanding dialogue and beautiful cinematography. It will surely earn a handful of Oscar nominations."	4.0	Stellar Performances and Great Direction.	2005-12-12	49	40	9
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3KJ6JAZPH382D	"Tim Brough ""author and music buff"""	"I know everyone keeps harping on ""Brokeback Mountain"" as the ""gay cowboy"" movie, but even as a gay man, there was so much more there that I was watching. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a rare movie that portrays gay men realistically, perhaps one of the very few American Movies to do so. (""Philadelphia"" and ""Longtime Companion"" being the other two on a very short list.) Meet any committed couple that lives outside a metro area, and they will relate alot of the same experiences; the false marriages, the children they were terrified of abandoning, the constant fear of being discovered and the sad reconciling to yourself that your life is going to remain a tormented hetro-lie.To that extent, Heath Ledger completely captures the fear and self-terror that so many gay men who don't fit the cliche feel. After having his first explosion of desire in the mountains of Wyoming, he immediately stammers ""I ain't queer."" Ask any gay man over 40 about that incident, and I'd bet you over half could tell you of a similar situation that occurred in their own lives.But ""Brokeback Mountain"" is, again, of much greater substance than that. The script is an incredible, almost flawless economy of words and nuance. There is barely a wasted sentence or phrase in this movie. In fact, part of the drama is that there are so many long stretches of silence. (The initial meeting between Jack and Ennis, for instance.) The Annie Proulx short story to script adaptation by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana is only deviated from in a couple short segments (Jack Twist's interaction with his in-laws, most notably), with many of the key passages are lifted verbatim. And that is a good thing.Perhaps more than the terrific script is that all the principle actors execute their parts so perfectly. Both Anne Hathaway, who shatters her teeny-pop image as the (at first, anyway) clueless deb that marries Jack, and Michelle Williams, as the long suffering soul that marries Ennis (who does one of the film's many heartbreaking moments as she - without a word - conveys shock, confusion and sudden sadness when she first sees Ennis encounter Jack) stand above their roles. Even the brief appearances (Jack's parents near the movie's end, Randy Quaid as the bloated, bigoted herd-owner) stay completely on target.To that end, it is interesting to note how many of the film's detractors hide their homophobia behind statements like ""this movie is just about an affair and how it ruins lives."" Yes, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is about an affair. But saying that it's just a cheater's movie is like saying that ""Hamlet"" is just a ghost story. There is a lot more going on here, the underscore of the forbidden and the tragedy of the unrealized life. When Anne Hathaway describes to Ennis the ""official"" story behind the returned letters from Jack while the true circumstances play out in a breif flashback (and thus complete an earlier foreshadowing in the film), you really feel the loss for everyone involved.Again, the triumph of ""Brokeback Mountain"" is its great story about the tragedy of an unrealized life. Funny how something this honest yet true gets hypocritically slammed and ranked from certain theaters, when gratuitous violent swill like ""Hostel"" enters moviehouses with an R. Everyone involved with ""Brokeback Mountain,"" from Director Ang Lee to even the cinematrographers (who do a great job of making Canada look like the American Mid-West) deserve all the kudos being lavished upon them."	5.0	If you can't fix it, you just gotta stand it	2006-01-31	23	18	5

The only problem I have with this movie is the fact that they are sheep herders, and I thought there was an enmity between cowboys and sheep herders - but then again that's from 19th century history and not now. And the movie does move a bit slow and I'm not entirely convinced of Jack and Ennis being in love.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AFI2J9YHDNOZG	"Timothy C. Wingate ""History Buff"""	"This superb and superlative movie is one of the saddest and most uplifting I have seen in a very, very long time. The acting by all involved is exemplary and Ang Lee's direction is understated yet emphatic at the same time.I saw the first matinee of Brokeback Mountain here in Ottawa, Canada and at the end there was much sobbing and wimpering - mostly from the WOMEN in the audience. That is how affecting this movie is to viewers of all sexual persuasions. For that reason I believe the Academy Award for Best Picture was stolen from Brokeback Mountain because of the hidden homophobia still present in Hollywood, of all places!! There must be more gays and lesbians per capita there than any other place on earth but it is the producers and the power elite who ultimately decide - in their own minds only - what is palatable and acceptable for the American ""unwashed"". We must not forget the ""casting couch"" and the crypto-fags who produce and cast movies but are married with children yet still DEMAND sexual favours of all persuasions and perversions from aspiring AND established actors in order for them to get the parts.As a Canadian I was very proud of the cinematography of Banff and Jasper National Parks which stood in for Montana and the film is a glowing advertisement for the breathtaking scenery of those locations. The rise in the tourist trade from the US of A must have skyrocketed after Americans realised the natural splendoursexisting north of our common border.The acting by Gylenhaal and especially Heath Ledger is outstanding. Ledger carries the movie with his anguished non-communicativeness and the scene at the end with Jake's family will tug at your heart and your mind.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AQCJB67784DYU	"Timothy C. Wingate ""History Buff"""	"This superb and superlative movie is one of the saddest and most uplifting I have seen in a very, very long time.  The acting by all involved is exemplary and Ang Lee's direction is understated yet emphatic at the same time.I saw the first matinee of Brokeback Mountain here in Ottawa, Canada and at the end there was much sobbing and wimpering - mostly from the WOMEN in the audience.  That is how affecting this movie is to viewers of all sexual persuasions.  For that reason I believe the Academy Award for Best Picture was stolen from Brokeback Mountain because of the hidden homophobia still present in Hollywood, of all places!!  There must be more gays and lesbians per capita there than any other place on earth but it is the producers and the power elite who ultimately decide - in their own minds only - what is palatable and acceptable for the American ""unwashed"".  We must not forget the ""casting couch"" and the crypto-fags who produce and cast movies but are married with children yet still DEMAND sexual favours of all persuasions and perversions from aspiring AND established actors in order for them to get the parts.As a Canadian I was very proud of the cinematography of Banff and Jasper National Parks which stood in for Montana and the film is a glowing advertisement for the breathtaking scenery of those locations.  The rise in the tourist trade from the US of A must have skyrocketed after Americans realised the natural splendoursexisting north of our common border.The acting by Gylenhaal and especially Heath Ledger is outstanding.  Ledger carries the movie with his anguished non-communicativeness and the scene at the end with Jake's family  will tug at your heart and your mind.  Ledger's subdued and stylish acting there and at the very end is one of the best performances by an actor I have seen in a very long time.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A33QRDSD3J5WHE	"Timothy H. Tobish ""timberwolf1"""	"I first read this story in a doctor's office waiting room in 1997.  Having read ""The Shipping News,"" I knew of Annie Proulx, and as I was leafing through The New Yorker, I saw one of her stories.  So I started reading it.  The beginning was interesting and got my attention (the prologue was added later, it didn't appear in the original story as published in the magazine).  I thought it was going to be about two lonely young men finding each other in friendship.Then  WHAM, the first tent scene happens, and it suddenly gets a hell of a lot more interesting.  I raced through the story, and on its inevitable tragic conclusion, I completely lost it and began crying.  At that moment, the nurse came out, very concerned.  She saw the magazine in my hands, chuckled, and said """"Brokeback Mountain,"" huh?  You're the third one this week.""I remember thinking what an amazing film this would make, but that it never would get made.  I suffered through the rumors of other directors for years.  Finally, it was announced that Ang Lee was directing (SCORE!), and starring Heath Legdger (huh? well, at least he was good in ""Monster's Ball"" and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko as Jack Twist? WTF?).  Then it started was released in the Venice and Toronto film festivals, and took the top prizes in each.  The buzz started.  The anticipation was KILLING me.  Finally, it opens on December 9th (thank GOD I live in LA).  That Saturday, as I sat down in the theater, I couldn't believe it was actually TIME to see ""Brokeback Mountain.""  I had incredibly high expectations...killer story, ace screenwriters, Ang freaking Lee, winning every award under the sun.  How could it live up to my expectations?It didn't.  It exceeded them.  And no, it's not overhyped, it's THAT GOOD.The spare, but powerful, little story had been transformed into an archtypal tragedy of repressed love.  The opening on the mountain was majestically filmed, Brokeback Mountain is an idyllic Eden where two innocent young men find love in a completely unexpected place, and nurture it over a summer of sheep herding.  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I thought that their growing attraction was fairly obvious, and as they began to open up to each other an intimacy grew, slowly and cautiously leading up to that first encounter in the tent.  At the end of the summer, their idyll over, they marry, father children, and continue to meet several times a year to spend time in the outdoors and just be with each other.  The tragic ending is simply the most devastating moment on film that I've ever experienced, and, having read the story, I fully expected it...yet it just bowled me over.  I had to compose myself in the car for 20 minutes afterwards so I could drive home.  I thought I was over it, but the next day in the shower I lost it again.  This movie kicks you in the guts, then gets under your skin and stays there for a very long time.Ang Lee is a master, but this is his best work thus far.  He's created a film that tells a story in silences and glances rather than words, an extremely emotional film that somehow manages never to cross the line into sentmentality.  This film could have easily become a caricature in the hands of a lesser talent.  Lee lets it breathe, keeping the pace slow and letting the film tell us about the characters as quickly as it needs.  The emotional impact is greatly enhanced by Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous, but nuanced, cinematography (trivia bit, that's him in the Mexico scene) and Gustavo Santaolalla's haunting score and wonderful country music selections.I LOVED THE SHORT STORY, and Larry McMurtry and Dianna Ossana have done probably the best adaptation in cinematic history.  Unlike most adaptations from novels, which need to be trimmed, the short story needed fleshing out, particularly the characters of the long-suffering wives.  The added scenes felt nothing but organic to the story, seamlessly blending in with the framework created by Proulx.  The added scene between Ennis and his daughter was particularly welcomed, as it gives Ennis at least some small degree of hope and redemption, instead of a doomed life of isolation and emotional bleakness.Finally, the cast are uniformly superb.  Anne Hathaway is perfect as Jack's wife Lureen.  We first see her as a vital, vivacious rodeo queen who puts the moves on Jack and reels him in.  As the years go by, she becomes bitter and removed, probably due to her loveless marriage, as Jack was emotionally committed to someone else.  Ennis' wife Alma, wonderfully played by Michelle Williams, actually knows what's going on, yet doesn't confront Ennis for years, and long after divorcing him.  Her scene where she finally confronts him is an almost frightening outpouring of rage, sadness, and regret.Jake Gyllenhaal, despite my Donnie Darko misgivings, was superb.  I liked him a lot on first viewing, but it was only on my second and third viewings that I realized how truly good he really was, as I was distracted by Ledger's performance.  Jack is a quixotic character, mercurial, optimistic, and earnest, and Gyllenhaal plays him like a finely tuned violin.But Heath Ledger carries this entire film on his shoulders.  His stellar rendition of the brutally repressed Ennis is a career-defining triumph.  He completely disappears into the role, it's as if he knows how Ennis BREATHES, so rigid that his lips hardly moves when he talks, his body language encumbered.  Yet when he's with Jack, he allows himself to open up, and gradually allow himself to become intimate with another person.  Folks, this is the real deal.  This is up there with Ben Kingsly in ""Gandhi,"" Daniel Day Lewis in ""My Left Foot,"" and Charlize Theron in ""Monster.""  I completely forgot I was in a movie theater watching an actor, I was watching ENNIS DEL MAR.  The transformation was total, breathtaking acting at its best.Minor quibbles:  the ageing makeup was truly awful (note to some reviewers...the moustache doesn't disappear on Jack's lip in the scene near the end, it's a FLASHBACK), and the editing was a bit choppy, possibly due to the first editor dying and being replaced near the end of postproduction.  Hey, no film is perfect.However, this one gets about as close as it gets.  Six stars."	5.0	My Long Journey Up Brokeback Mountain	2006-02-16	37	29	8
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AXFF78OSCAB4P	Timothy Wilfong	"While I wanted to see Brokeback Mountain for the Ledger/Gyllenhaal make-out sessions, I found so much more was in store for me. Brokeback Mountain is an amazing movie for many reasons - the amazing directing, soundtrack, and cinematography - but what sets it apart from so many other movies being made right now is the acting. I've never thought of Heath Ledger as a particularly talented actor, but I'll admit when I'm wrong. He brings such realism to his character; as someone who grew up in rural, alpine Colorado, I have seen his character a thousand times in lonely ranch-hands. His inner battle over his sexuality is far from the mainstream personification of gay men in Hollywood and mainstream TV. Gyllenhaal shows the vulnerability of his character - extroverted, in need of affection (physical and otherwise), and trying to accept himself in a way that Ennis (Ledger) can't. I hope that the acting will be a vehicle to show viewers that the ""modern gay man"" can be anyone, from any walk of life, from any corner of this country."	5.0	Surprised	2006-01-11	9	7	2
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3G00T481USIIM	Titlelog	I'm still amazed that a movie which made me feel so forlorn could also be such a big hit.  Maybe it is the star-crossed lovers factor.  Maybe some people feel justified that this love affair leads to sheer heartache and misery.  Ultimately, I think the secret to this film's success is that it gives us so much to think about.I was initially disappointed by what seems to be a lack of romance on the screen.  It's almost as if the filmmakers wanted to establish the relationship between these two men, but didn't want to push it on the audience.  The couple doesn't spend time gazing into each other's eyes, and they never even say those three little words to each other.  What they mostly do is talk about why they can't be together--which is basically what this film is about.  Even though their love often seems incomplete, we still know it's there.  When these poor souls are apart, the anguish and frustration they feel manifests itself in almost every aspect of their lives.Jake Gyllenhaal is wonderful in this movie, but Ledger's portrayal of Ennis is literally beyond words.  He brings us a character who is handcuffed by society and his fear of being exposed, but we also get to know him as someone who is as assertive as he is reticent, and as strong as he is vulnerable.  You can't help but love the guy, and that makes it even harder to see him endure so much pain.	5.0	Love Story	2006-04-10	40	31	9
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3GJY8T7ED30LV	T. MacCallum	Rent/buy this movie, period. This is the best film of 2005, and most critics agree--which is rare. In fact I have yet to read an unfavorable review written by a professional critic. Anyone who would rate this film less than A- in Story, Acting, Direction, Visuals, and Overall probably did not actually see the film! It is such an honest portrayal of two people's love for each other.The breathtaking cinematography alone is oscar-worthy. Then you have the masterpiece short and simple story transformed to the big screen effortlessly. Heath Ledger could have won best actor for his portrayal of the cowboy whose emotions were so far bottled up inside him that he could barely speak. You can feel his every emotion, ranging from guilt, embarrassment, sorrow and joy without his uttering more than a few syllables. Jake is also brilliant. Both are at the beginning of very long and fruitful careers if this is a part of what they are capable of.This film starts in 1963, a time when acceptance of diversity was not widespread. In some ways we have come a long way from that time period, but in others our country has not. This film affirms why two people in love (man/woman, man/man, woman/woman) should be given equal rights in marriage under the law--why marriage has caused a big policital debate does not make sense. Aren't there other, more significant global problems to deal with than two people in love wanting to have a recognized committed relationship? This film is not about that issue specifically, but it is impossible not to consider this after you see the results of these two men living a life of secrets and lies over several years. One tries to come up with a solution, whereas the other is too ashamed and fearful to pursue his truth. And it is a shame--a very sad reality. See the movie, especially if you are hetero, because for 2 hours you may see the best film ever made about two men in love, and some of the challenges it can bring. Ask yourself what you would do in either of the men's situations.  Would you be honest about who you are and who you love or hide in shame and fear because of how others might judge you?	5.0	Best Picture 2005	2006-11-25	30	25	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3BB932QJUF43E	T. Martin	"This is an outstanding movie and sad story about two cowboys who fall in love with, of all people, each other.  Neither considers himself gay, and neither understands why this happened to them.  And both try to resist it and bow to social pressures by maintaining the facade of a traditional married life. But neither of them can escape the intense love and longing they have for each other and carry on their illicit affair over the course of 20 years.  The endlessly hopeful Jack insists that he and Ennis can build a life together as ""ranching partners,"" but it is the realist Ennis that resists such illusions (after all, it takes place in a time that was less-accepting of gays).  But both continue to long for such a life with each other.It's a sad story in that their intense love is never allowed to be realized except in their occasional encounters on Brokeback Mountain.  The tag line ""Love is a force of nature"" really says it all.  We can't help who we fall in love with, and it's especially tragic when our own attitudes and the attitudes of our society prevent that love from being realized, with unhappy consequences.  It's about people who don't fit in, and how they cope with that.  This movie is highly recommended, IF you're ready for it.(And don't believe the sensationalistic reactionaries screaming that it's ""gay porn.""  There are more heterosexual sex scenes than gay, and there arene't even very many of those!  The one gay sex scene is only about 15-20 seconds long and shows not much more than faces and arms.  Those people are just reacting to their own biases and ignorance.  Neither does the movie ""promote"" adultery.  Instead, it shows what can happen when you can't be true to yourself, so it must be viewed with this in mind and within the context of the years [60's-70's] when it takes place.)"	5.0	"NOT a ""gay cowboy movie"""	2006-01-19	10	8	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A26LIR24MAM6VQ	"todd rich ""scoop 69"""	"Every so often , a film is released that breaks all of the barriers and plunges deep beneath the power of cinema and spreads messages of hope in love. This isn't the film. "" Brokeback Mountain "" isn't a film that shows us something new. It isn't a film that provides a new message to the masses. This film's magic and strengths aren't in the message. This film's power is in the performances , cinematography , directing , and the unforgettable acting. Penned by Larry McMurtry ( Lonesome Dove ) and Diana Ossana , this film was highly anticipated to sweep the 2005 Oscars. It was well recieved and was in fact nominated for 8 Academy Awards. Ironically , it did win 3 Oscars but lost Best Picture to another phenominally well acted film , entitled "" Crash "". Personally , I belive that Heath Ledger should've recieved an Oscar for his performance as Best Actor. Originally , "" Brokeback Mountain "" was pegged as a gay cowboy flick. Even if it was , that still wouldn't be new. John Voight did a gay scene in 1969's "" Midnight Cowboy "" , Matthew Broderick did it in 1988's ""Torch Song Trilogy "", Harry Hamlin did it in 1982's "" Making Love "", Tom Berringer did it in 1977's "" Looking for Mr. Goodbar "", Robbie benson did it in 1976's "" Ode to Billy Joe "" , the late actor Brad Davis did it in 1978's ""Midnight Express"".Hollywood has done everything a million times. Nothing has been rediscovered or invented here. However , this film retells the power of love with a rare and unflinching sensativity. Just so happens that instead of ""the poor boy that can't fall in love with the rich girl "" , it's "" the boy can't fall in love with the other boy "". However , the unforgettable moments come from the actors and their stunning, sensitive,  and unforgettable portrayals. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, portray two cowhands , hired to watch cattle on a mountian , during the winter in the 1960's. Isolated , lonely , young , and reliant on each other in the rugged wilderness , the two begin a love affair that spans the rest of the their lives. Unfortunatly , their love has to remain a secret because of their own denials and the prejudices , fears , and ignorance towards homosexuality from outsiders. Ang Lee does a phenominal job at directing , Rodrigo Prieto does an unforgettable job as the film's cinematographer and Gustavo Santaolalla provides a musical score that will always be remembered in a haunting connection to the film. Persoanlly , I had my own prejudices towards the film , prior to me seeing it. However , I truly believe that this is a very rare film because it succeeds in telling a message that wouldn't normally be recognized in a typical love story. It spreads the awareness of ignorance and intollerance and ultimately makes it personal by illustrating the power of self destruction through fear and denial. "" Brokeback Mountain "" is an unforgettable film , and I highly recommend it. It does contain nudity , strong sexual content , violence and strong profanity and I don't recommend it for viwers under 18."	5.0	Piggybacked theme on Brokeback	2006-09-19	26	22	4
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A233QN6P2EEKPS	Tom Collier	"During the first twenty minutes or so of Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain, we are introduced to Ennis and Jack, two cowboys watching over sheep in Wyoming. Ennis, a sulky, quiet redneck type, feels right at home being a cowboy. Bright eyed and chatty, Jack seems like he would have been better off growing up in the city. The two men watch over the sheep, hunt, and get to know each other. The film plays these scenes in a straightforward, simple manner, and if not for the massive hype surrounding the film's content, it would be a total shock when they begin to have sex.Quiet subtlety is Brokeback Mountain's greatest asset. If a hundred directors were assigned to make a film about gay cowboys, it is doubtful that many would be more subtle than Ang Lee. The film does not take great pains to show us they are in love, nor does it twelve scenes where the characters spell out their every thought with tears streaming down their faces, nor does it stick around for soft pornography. The majority of what is going in is expressed in the characters faces, actions, and simple but effective dialogue. Heath Leder turns in a phenomenal performance as Ennis, who even when in a moment of peace, seems to be in agony. Jake Gyllenhaal is nearly as good as Jack, who impatiently wades through his life, waiting for the happiness he knows must be around the corner.Ennis and Jack part when the summer is over, Ennis staying in Wyoming, Jack moving to Texas. Neither one is overly enthused about their lives, which include wives and children, but they carry on. One day, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack, and before you know it the two are going on ""fishing trips"" where no fishing takes place. Jack declares that the two should leave their families and get a farm together, but Ennis quietly scoffs. It is still the 1960's, and as a boy, his father showed him firsthand the potentially violent death that can await a homosexual.Brokeback Mountain is not so much about homosexuality or love as it is unfulfilled desire. Jack can not have what he badly wants, and Ennis' is not willing to take the steps towards his own possible happiness. The film is not nearly as pro-homosexuality as some would have you believe; indeed, throughout the film, Ennis and Jack's relationship destroys their own lives and badly damages that of others. Instead of giving into their desires or suppressing them entirely, they try halfway, which does not work.  In one scene, Ennis ignores his own children in his desperation to run off to a motel with Jack. In another, Jack slinks through a Mexican border town, searching for a male prostitute. These are not happy men, certainly not the characters GLAAD would push.Brokeback Mountain is a magnificent story of men doomed by impulses they would each rather not possess. One's own opinions of the politics and morality of homosexuality need not matter much, as everyone can connect to the pain of not having what it is you want most. Is there any feeling much worse than that?"	4.0	Powerful tale of desire unfulfilled	2006-04-03	41	33	8

It's a common symptom of the sexual insecurity which a lot of Americans wear so proudly, further evidenced in the fraud of male genital mutilation, euphemistically known as ""circumcision"".It takes a lot of consideration for me to pay for a film at the cinema, and I can usually tell if a film is going to be any good, or at least something to which I can relate or enjoy.  I usually don't care for country/western genre films.  However, given that, the simplicity and honesty of this film simply astounded and forced me to see past the country element.  The story is poignant (look for the brilliant symbolism).  The ending is classic.  Anyone who has truly fallen in love from a distance can relate to this story.  The distant and rural scenes of this film illuminates the sense of loneliness and longing within the characters.  It's not often to find a soul mate and sad when one is forced to live a double life to express love for that person, especially from a distance.  If Jack and Ennis hadn't been in love, they wouldn't have bothered, given the inconvenient and unruly nature of their culture, or lack thereof.  Their relationship isn't only about sexual expression, it's about the journey they take as a result of their love for one another.""Crash"" technically was chosen, and maybe it's a good film, but I hadn't even heard of it until a week ago.

Only an ignorant person would say this film is about gays, because it's not. The film is about love. Pure and simple. And it will remain a noble and triumphant film about love for the rest of time.

It is about so much more than sexual orientation. Brokeback Mountain is a modern tradgedy that connects with an experience of life of which everyone has gotten a taste. Gay, Straight, Bisexual...all people have known varying degrees of the pain borne by Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist. See this movie and allow yourself to experience its pain...you'll feel more alive for it.	5.0	A Force of Human Nature.	2006-01-19	12	11	1
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A5CWLQF6QO3CN	"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B..."	"Lee Ang proved that he could direct once again with Brokeback Mountain. Relationship drama is always Lee's strength and the move to direct the Hulk movie could be regarded as one of the biggest mistakes in his directing career.Brokeback Mountain could be said as a continuation Lee Ang's attempt to read into a gay loving story. Wedding Banquet is one of his major successes. It precisely nailed down the dilemmas of a how a gay American Chinese tried to act straight in front of his parents, even going to the extent of having a fake wedding to satisfy the expectations of his family. In Brokeback Mountain, two guys deeply in love in a forbidden age within a forbidding profession. Heath Ledger gave his prime performance as the cowboy with little words Ennis. He is bad in expressing his emotions and the only emotion he could exhibit is his anger. Ennis' lack of speech and strong social conscious immediately place the undying relationship into the grave right from the start. Jake Gyllenhaal plays brilliantly as the part of Jack, who in his whole life try to make the relationship work at all cost. They met, they part and all they can look forward to is an opportunity to meet again, sometime. For Ennis and Jack, each departure could mean forever. It's stressful, heartbreaking and sad. This could be summed up by Jack's monologue ""I wish I could quit you...all we have left is the Brokeback Mountain"" It's an addiction that both parties cannot quit, but at the same time cannot uphold.Michelle Williams showcasted a power performance as Ennis' wife, who accidentally discovered her husband's real love. Devastated, heartbroken but determined to stay silence for many years. I read that she was disowned by her high school because of her participation in the project. But a high school ownership doesn't mean anything for an actor to have such a breathtaking and memorable performance (maybe her high school should disown every single graduate who went through a divorce then).Brokeback Mountain certainly marks a performance of an outstanding cast with an outstanding story. The dialogues are so well written that they completely and tightly tie the plot together. Heath Ledger is different as Nicole Kidman is different in The Hours. Jake Gyllenhall once again proved that he is one of the best young talents in Hollywood. For Lee Ang, this is an incredible movie that put him right back on to the map of the best directors of the current age - only if he is going to choose his next project right."	5.0	A breathtaking performance with the chills of the Brokeback Mountain	2006-03-04	27	21	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	It is wonderful to see Ang Lee come back with `Brokeback Mountain,' beautifully-shot, heart-rending drama about two cowboys and their forbidden love. Some of you might find the film's theme not so attractive at first, but don't worry, the film can be appreciated as a love story, and a very good and nuanced one too.The quiet opening section is the strongest part, where Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are hired to guard the sheep in the mountains in the early 1960s. The sparse use of dialogues and soundtrack enhance the emotional tension between them, with a help from the stunning photography of Rodrigo Prieto, who captures the serene beauty of Brokeback Mountain,Then we meet Ennis and Jack four years later, both married and with children. While Jack considers the possibility of living together, Ennis, who recounts a horrible episode from his childhood memories, evades the topic altogether, suggesting his repressed fear about the consequences of such a life. However, as time goes by - and the film covers about 20 years of their life -- their hidden (so they believe) relations inevitably influence those around them, especially the life of Alma (Michelle Williams), Ennis's wife.First and foremost, `Brokeback Mountain' is a success as the poignant love story between Ennis and Jack. Jake Gyllenhaal is good as Jack, clearly more seductive of the two, but it is Heath Ledger who embodies the sadness of these two lovers. Ennis is a good example of a lonely soul, who knows nothing about his own life except that he messed it up somewhere in the past.Female roles are less impressive though Michelle Williams shines as tormented wife of Ennis. Ann Hathaway plays Laureen, Jack's wife, but talented as she is, I think the NYC-born actress is miscast as Texas girl. (And there are brief nudity of them, which is totally unnecessary here.) Anna Faris, Linda Cardellini, and Kate Mara also appear, but with the exception of Kate Mara, who plays the daughter of Ennis and seeks for the love of her father, the good cast is largely wasted.`Brokeback Mountain' is not without flaws. Perhaps it could have been better with more time to tell the story, but the emotional power of the central theme is strong all the same, and the end results of their story are simply overwhelming.	5.0	Love Story, Potent and Nuanced	2006-04-28	45	34	11
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ANN4JW1E08AS6	tuberacer	"Heath Ledger does an amazing transformation performance. He is so in character, you know who this guy is. You've seen him around on the American landscape. A very reserved, quiet young man raised in the back roads amongst pain and prejudice--a man who has gained strength simply by enduring while avoiding becoming another of the perpetrators--but that strength also clamps down around him and shuts him up. He is trapped in his strength and much of his energy is simpy spent on keeping his tightly knotted self-preservation intact.. Along comes Jack Twist.That first sexual encounter really comes out of left field. There wasn't anything beforehand that suggested that we should expect it or that those kinds of feelings, whatever those feelings were supposed to be, were growing in these characters, and I'd say that was the film's one big flaw. There was no real sense of a romance brewing, nor even lust--at least, not in the Ennis character and only very faint hints in the Jack character. Perhaps that was Ang Lee's bowing down to the reality of what the mass audience would tolerate, or upon what the film studio would tolerate considering the financial risk. Or maybe it was simply that that particular kind of romance is such uncharted territory in a major motion picture that both the movie maker and the mass audience are at a complete loss to negotiate any conventional terms for portraying it. The shared visual lexicon in film simply doesn't have the conventions yet to portray this kind of ""romance,"" so only with baby steps, film by film, can the  journey into this territory begin. Female gay romance has been dealt with many more times than male gay romance in mainstream film. Actually, I can only think of one or two films before this one that has made the attempt.What Lee uses is a mixture of passion and brutality to depict their early relationship, but does that actually reveal their deep affection? Under their circumstances, for these two characters, maybe it does. Maybe their interiors are so tightly bound up by exteriors of cultural and self-inflicted constrictions that only on the back of violence can the two interiors break through to each other. But to buy this first sex scene you'd almost have to buy into some kind of undetectable telepathy that's been going on between Ennis and Jack because you certainly don't see any real evidence of anything brewing at this level before the tent scene. And actually, the why's and wherefore's of the attraction are never really revealed in the film, especially for Ennis, and Ennis's later excitement at seeing Jack and then running headlong into passion with him also seemed out of character. He wasn't ""queer,"" he had said earlier.  What happened? The interiors of these homosexual feelings are not really explored at all. It all just happens. And as someone else has mentioned, that first sex scene does, in a way, reinforce stereotypes about gay sex, and also suggests that the situation is not unfamiliar to Ennis since he seems to know about, and  go right into, the expected action. This is strange since we're never given any suggestion of a history of previous gay encounters for Ennis. On the contrary, he's about to, matter-of-factly, marry a woman. There are moments in this tale, though, when you see it really is about love, just basic love--moments which may take non-gays (like myself) out of any prevailing prejudices for a few heartbeats and see that it truly is possible.The level of drama in this film is exceptional. This is very sophisticated story telling using the film medium. Lee proves again his remarkable resourcefulness and ability to focus sharply on subject matter that one would not expect from someone from a completely different culture. The depiction of the west/midwest here is deep and very convincing. You would think this could only be the product of an American movie maker. There are microscopic provincial idiosyncrasies in this film that Lee shouldn't know anything about. Who is this guy, Ang Lee? How does he do it, time after time? How does this foreigner get it so right? I've been a big fan of his since ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,"" which I watched three times at the theater when it first came out. Little did I know then what a peculiar direction his career would go in after that."	5.0	convincing moments	2007-10-12	10	5	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AY6A8KPYCE6B0	Tyson	"This movie really is as huge as the hype has made it out to be.  First it's really the first gay love story (if you want to call it a love story) to go mainstream, second it's got two pulitzer prize winners and Ang Lee involved, third it's got the best acting I have ever seen on film, and when you mix everything together you get the most professional adaptation of a written work I wouldn't want to say ever done, but it certainly might be.You probably know the story by now, so I won't go on with plot summeries, but I will tell you what made me attend this film 4 times at the theater:As an English major this movie was like literary heaven.  After the first time I watched it I was blown away by all the foreshadow, symbolism, parallels, and poetric transitions that this film did perfectly.  For instance, Jack always misses what he ""shoots"" (coyote, deer) but Ennis hits them.  In a sense Ennis has ""hit"" Jack, but Jack can never really ""hit"" Ennis.At the end of one scene Alma throws down mail and the camera captures an ad for Honey.  In the next seen Jack says ""Honey"" to his wife.  What a great Poetic transition!There are many parallels, most notably that embrace from behind.  Jack and Ennis do it twice, once while in the motel and another during the flashback when Jack is ""sleeping like a horse.""  Alma also embraces Ennis from behind in the first bedroom scene when she wants to move into town.  Even the their two shirts together in the end can be considered an embrace from behind.Jack foreshadows his outcome by wearing purple in one scene.I could go on and on and on with all the fun English and Literary goodies I found by watching the movie--trust me, I took pen and paper into the theater and filled up 5 front-and-back pages of notes.  But I think I can summerize how I feel about this film by simply saying it is outstanding, and will always be considered Best Picture no matter what the Oscars have to say."	5.0	Genius	2006-03-21	27	23	4

Down through the years, they get together twice a year, for some rest and relaxation.  Jack would love to get together and live together, but Ennis resists because of the social ramifications and an incident that happened when he was a young boy of barely nine years old.  I initially watched this movie because of the titillating nature of the subject matter, but halfway through, I started to understand this is much, much more than just a gay cowboy movie.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2EMKM2VF3YGDZ	U-culio	"(This comment is written primarily for those who have already seen the movie at least once on the big screen)Like millions of people before me who have come to appreciate the beauty of Latin maxims, simple yet elegant at the same time, I, too, have added a few such famous sayings to my cherished memories over the years. One of such is: ""magna est veritas, et praevalebit"", and another more popular one begins with ""omnia vincit amor"". The profound truths in these pithy expressions are so inviting and eternally fresh that any attempt for explanation not only seems superfluous, but dilutes and degrades as well.Never had I had any doubts about these categorical truths or their universal applicability until I had the opportunity to watch Brokeback Mountain on the big screen. While the surface story, the romance between the star-crossed same-sex lovers, is as plain as the broad daylight, (indeed, a few movie-goers and critics did seem heinously satisfied at working out such a cruel and over-simplified conclusion), it is the undercurrent that adds texture and charm to its wide appeal. Thoughts and images thus provoked from viewers' own past and a growing concern for humanity and the human condition are not among the first and definitely not the easiest that millions of movie-goers can shake off as they drive home. For many, the nostalgia for Brokeback Mountain will set in much too soon and linger on much longer than they ever thought possible.So, what is Brokeback Mountain after all? Simply put, it's a movie that love is conquered and lovers are consumed and all this is made possible only under the careful direction and watchful eyes of Ang Lee, an amazing individual whose appreciation for humanity and superb ability to translate that appreciation faithfully into the silver screen will unequivocally peg himself among that rare species of gifted few who had ever bestowed a modern Olympia into the hearts of the viewing public.Many have expressed a view that the harsh physical and social environment in the unforgiving heartland of Wyoming, seat for the century-old rural homophobia, directly or indirectly, was culpable for the tragic results of Ennis and Jack's romance, yet the story and movie have beamed through and transcended far beyond all boundaries for an individual's loss of love. This gripping movie, therefore, testifies *VULNERABILITY* of mankind in general. And what a vulnerability it has depicted!These two poor and unenviable cowpokes, each with limited education, limited vision for life, are doomed from the very beginning to have a life of limited success, at the very best, in such an environment, yet now it is their unique love story that will resonate triumphantly with the majority of public, for good. Both men and especially Ennis, appear quite muscular, yet such shells of masculinity alone are no match for their predestined hardscrabble lifestyles as ranch hand or rodeo boy. Does that mean both should just recognize their fate, admit that they are socially and economically disadvantaged and live out their lives the best they can and remain humbly submissive to the juggernaut of social norms? Many in similar situations probably would have, yet they have chosen the hard way, periodically retreating to the Brokeback Mountain, the only refuge on earth they knew, the only safe-haven where their innocence could be protected and prolonged. And the price they had to pay as years went by? Double lives in shadows with much added pains, so endless and an uneasiness, utterly unbearable. There was simply no royal road or easy way out of this extremely unsatisfying situation, while constant fears and self-denials gnawed them inside out.Ang Lee, or for that matter, E. Annie Proulx as well, doesn't even pretend to have a ready answer for us mortals. All he did was to present this ineffably sad story as realistically and intelligently as possible, with nothing more and nothing less, leaving no stones unturned. Lee had attacked no one and had no ""other"" agenda. Lee, first and foremost, was simply stunned and has been captivated ever since by the purity, strength and depth of this kind of male bond. However incompatible and at odds it may seem to be with the rest of human society, it is nonetheless in complete harmony with the *TRUE NATURE* of these two men.There are no make-believe special effects, no dizzy plot line or other cheap gimmicks, just the plain, uncluttered story itself, simple yet elegant in its own right. In the end, Lee has achieved few have ever aspired for or begun to embark, an unbiased, unique story centered on an unglamorous couple that most people can relate and respond to, on many different levels. Seeing the irrevocable personal losses from society's least endowed members (unfortunately, the good looks of these actors/actresses tend to do a disservice here and blur this poignant fact) unfolded painstakingly on screen was the last straw that opened the floodgates of emotions from millions of viewers. More than entertaining, it is no less educational. Never claimed to be uplifting, Brokeback Mountain did help to disown some ingrained biases in more than just a handful few since its debut. As far as the art form of motion picture goes, by now, Lee is definitely a true master, sensitively and versatile, with piercingly keen eyes and a big warm heart.In just one scoop, my once seemingly unbreakable faith in ""omnia vincit amor"" is now completely smashed by Brokeback Mountain, and yet surprisingly this has aroused no hard feelings on my part at all, for, it's always the second half of this very maxim, ""nos et cedamus amori"" that really counted!"	5.0	When love is conquered and lovers are consumed	2006-02-01	22	11	11

All I have to say about that is, get over it and grow up. This isn't a film about sexuality, or homosexuality. It is about 2 people, who happen to be men, who meet and grow close. Its not an explicit film, it is all done extremely well and directed beautifully and tastefully. Ang Lee is a favorite of mine, especially after Sense and Sensibility. Brokeback Mountain is easily another score for him. It really is a beautifully touching movie. I must say that at times, it frustrated me, or I should say, the characters frustated me. Everyone wants a happy ending but sometimes, Its just not possible. This is a depressing and moving film. And because of the maturity of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, its a very realistic and believable film. They really brought the characters to life and were very brave for attempting something that really wasn't attempted before in recent memory. Those actors took a risk and it worked.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3KLC5M7K1C5FJ	Vato-Curandero	"Before reviewing Brokeback Mountain, I must dismiss some of the absurd and ridiculous statements circulating about the movie. First, this film does NOT contain a bunch of gay sex scenes! This film is NOT anti-family values (what the hell are ""family values,"" anyway?), and this movie does not promote the ""gay agenda!""I am heterosexual. I am not gay, none of my friends are gay (at least that I know of), and I have no gay family members that I know of either. One should not have to make this disclaimer, but anti-gay activists are accusing those who like this movie of having an agenda. Having said that, I thought Brokeback Mountain was fantastic. This might possibly be the best film I've seen in the theaters so far in 2006, and after watching the film, I spent weeks on end thinking about the content of the film. Great movies have a way of making viewers do that.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall first meet in Wyoming in 1963 when both are in their early 20s looking for summer work. They end up finding employment with a local sheep herder, and in the process, find out a thing or two about themselves. The two develop feelings for one another, but under the anti-gay socialization each has been raised with, quickly attempt to suppress these emotions.At the end of the summer, each man returns to his hometown to pursue his respective life. Ledger gets married and has two daughters, while Gyllenhall returns to Texas and meets a cowgirl at a tavern. They get married and have a son.However, Ledger and Gyllenhall end up meeting up again several years later. Emotions are rekindled, leading to complications in their relationships with their respective families and each other.This movie shows the mental anguish and emotional turmoil that results from being forced to live a double life at the hands of society. The film actually made me rethink and reconsider a lot of the stereotypes that I held towarards homosexuals, and Brokeback Mountain is an important and timely film.Everyone I know who saw this film in the theater thinks it is phenomenal. There is great acting, and the cinematography is breathtaking: herds of sheep flocking about the screen, the mountains and lakes of the Rocky Mountains, and the rugged terrain and cornfields of Texas. At the end of the day, Brokeback Mountain is as much or even more a Western film (not a ""gay film"" that its bashers would have us believe) than anything else.

I didn't necessarily think that it was ""the greatest love story of all time,"" or that the movie was ""the best film ever made,"" but for what it is, it's definitely a triumph that breaks boundaries, hopefully allowing the film industry to broaden their horizons and touch upon deeper and untouched territory that we shouldn't necessarily hide or be afraid of.

I put it in the machine rather quickly and hoped for a movie that was going to leave some sort of impact on me because of all the hype surrounding its release.The first time I watched this movie I was letdown.

There's nothing more that could be wanted though, and I know that now. This truly is a great story.The acting is brilliant from everyone in this film! I think the first time I watched this movie I should have turned the volume up because Heath Leger's character mumbles a bit--he's a man of few words. I think because I didn't catch everything he said the first time I really missed much of this movie. It's a story about love. A story about how you should always be true to yourself and the one you love. It sounds simple, but it's far from simple, and this movie proves that.There will always be some people that refer to this as the ""gay cowboy movie"" but it's not. True, the characters are cowboys, but gay people are like everyone else, and they are everywhere and every type of person. Some people have a problem with this movie because it deals with homosexuality, but they have their own issues and miss the point of this movie entirely.I was letdown the first time I watched this movie, and there are reasons for it, but I'm not letdown now. The only thing that lets me down is I wasn't able to enjoy this completely the first time, and I've only seen the movie twice in three years, but I'm sure I'll be watching it constantly from now on.This movie is beautiful and tragic. It's a great story, and it'll stand the test of time.

To take that persona and show the story of two who dare to be different, is one of the bigger things that make Brokeback Mountain so great. Second, the acting is not mediocre at most. It's brilliant, and if you had ever seen Heath Ledger or Jake Gyllenhaal act before, you might realize this movie represents incredible breakout performances for both.

This film, ""Brokeback Mountain"", is now 'locked' into the American landscape as not only one of the best films of all time, but one of the most important. The Two- Disc Collector's Edition only re- confirms the majesty and brilliance of Ang Lee's direction and deserved Best Directors Award from the Academy. One cannot resist being pulled into this film and being apart of these two men's struggle. The first 'male sex' experience for Ennis in the tent is raw, intense, shocking and beautiful all at the same time. You are left speechless and your heart pounding. The first kiss between Jack and Ennis is tender, gentle and sensual... both are capable of loving. Hollywood has always chickened out in following through from here. ""Brokeback Mountain"" does not. I believe this film will soon go down in the American history books as a vital and all- out important work and contribution to art, film and literature, alike."	5.0	A Masterpiece.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2W4PSP3I7CL4B	WAMophile	I was a reluctant viewer.  All those raving reviews.  The oscar hype and best picture (not getting it) controversy.  The gay theme.  The cowboy theme.  The Ledger mumble. And so on. I feared both the good and bad hype--foolish me.It started beautifully with some deliberately iconic scenes and poses, framed within the context of but to shatter the Gary Cooper/Shane mystique.  That set piece of Ledger leaning against the wall, Gyllenhall leaning against the car, the surreptitious yet almost lusty glance from JG's character; the glance he throws HL through the driver's mirror as he's shaving. This was an AL shout that either it would be a spectacular failure or a great film.The much vaunted cinematography is beautiful, but does not slap you over the head with its magnificence as does such films as Lawrence of Arabia--making it that much more powerful in its quiet restraint, which to a large extent describes this film. Elegant as it is, this film slowly, systematically tears you apart, leaving you feeling as barren, ragged and yet as moved as the characters.The acting from every single character is true.  I think Michelle Williams' performance is a spectacular revelation, who knew that a second banana from a teen melodrama series could act with such depth and restraint and emotional power. The shattering of her illusions is at least as soul destroying as that of the main characters.  And Anne Hathaway has a tremendous moment towards the end; in a few minutes she injects 20 years of tamped down pain and bitterness, yet through that pain, she projects a sympathy for someone else's tragedy which is unexpected, yet still in character.  The performances in this film are truly the best I've seen by a group of actors. Each of the characters breaks your heart, one by one.	5.0	finally saw it and got my heart broken for my effort	2006-07-23	58	52	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2DFO8EIWTSCNS	W. A Mynatt	It has been a very long time since I saw a movie that made me feel what the characters were feeling.  That Jake and Heath convey the love and pain these two men felt is a testimony to their acting ability.  It is frustrating to watch and want them to go somewhere else to be together.  But they are who they are, living within the limits of their own world and souls.  The weakest performance,  Jack's wife, is still a pretty good one.  The sweeping and beautiful cinematography is overshadowed only by the scenes of intimacy between the characters.  The music alone will draw out your tears.	5.0	Very moving	2006-04-06	27	22	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2CDMCG1Z84A51	Wanda B. Red	"I feel I must explain four stars rather than five; there is so much hype about this movie -- not only in the culture at large but here on amazon.com.Yes, it is a great movie. Heath Ledger as Ennis especially does an amazing job of conveying the pain that is exacted from repressing his love for another man. It remains unclear if the entrance of Jack into his life liberated him into understanding who he really was or created a heartbreaking problem for him as he became unable to function in his relationship with his wife and, to some extent, his daughters. The film is to be commended for allowing that kind of ambiguity to exist.Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams (who plays his wife Alma) do a really impressive job together of showing how corrosive a competing passion can be to a relationship that starts out with love, respect, and even some attraction. I believed most fully in Jack's and Ennis's love when I saw how eager Ennis was to leave his wife and go off fishing with his lover. The film understands that passion always exists in a social context.But I was expecting to be more deeply moved by that passion, between Ennis and Jack, which is the basic premise of the film. Without that, you have nothing, and I just didn't feel the chemistry. Even after watching this film with all the best intentions in the world, I didn't really feel the basic pull that would draw this one specific man to  the other. I didn't feel it in the script as the characters were developed, and I didn't feel it on screen in their love scenes. There, I felt like I was watching two straight men on the screen perform sexual acts on each other that made me uncomfortable. Is that about me, a straight woman? Maybe. But I actually got a more developed sense of love between men from watching the interesting domestic relationship of Truman Capote and Jack Dunphy (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bruce Greenwood) in the film ""Capote"" (which I personally think should have won best film) than I got here, even though there was no kissing in that movie.In the end, I was disappointed with the number of cliched tricks that Ang Lee resorted to in order to finish off this film, for instance Ennis endlessly smelling and kissing Jack's shirt. Don't get me wrong: It's a very good film. It's only a beginning, though. Here's a question: Why cast two straight men in these parts? I just don't think they had it in them to convey to a receptive audience what it means for a man to love a man. I'm still waiting for the movie that will do that for me."	4.0	Really liked it, not totally convinced	2006-04-20	37	9	28
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1HBI9BBQIG1NH	Ward J.

Ang Lee's work will be a landmark movie for eons to come.I feel ""Crash"" will be considered a lesser movie,and people will be questioning why this epic earned best director,and why it didn't get recognition for the most engaging film of the year.

Embarrassment and fear of judgment is a large part of it...ANYWAY, that may kind of seem like unnecessary info but it's pertinent to my comments, in that this movie made me feel emotional and *GASP!* almost made me cry. :-) _That_ is how I know a movie is good, when it doesn't just touch me (like many a movie has in the past), but touches me to where my emotional block almost gives way. There's only been a few movies in my recollection that have hit me like that; this was one of 'em. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I _didn't_ cry! If I had then I would have given it the full 5.There are many parts that move me (mostly Ennis's of course), but the part that really got to me was at the end when he opens his closet and looks at Jack's shirt and says, ""Jack Twist, I swear.""  That's the part that gets me the most!  The saddest thing to me, of the whole movie is that Ennis denied his relationship with Jack, leaving Jack longing for him badly, causing his wife and daughters pain at divorcing, not to mention that last blonde gal he went out with, and eventually never knowing and having what could have been with Jack, because of his death. That is one of the things that makes this movie memorable, and reminds me that love is a wonderful thing that is worthy of chasing no matter what the odds, even though serious risks my be present.I suspect this movie is more affecting and more ""relatable"" with a new meaning and significance, to homosexuals, esp. those that have gone through similar situations. I haven't gone through Ennis and Jack's plight, but I can sure relate to a lot of things about the story!Crash may have won the Best Picture, and Crash is a good movie for sure, that also affected me and made me think, but I highly agree that it should have taken second place to this amazing movie. Anyone that is homophobic or is trying to overcome that phobia, it would be a strong suggestions to see this movie as it presents some of the very common struggles that straight and gay people alike can relate to, that many a straight couple has probably had to go through in the past. And, it shows that love between two men is just as beautiful and wonderful as love between a man and a woman, no matter who or what both men are.This is too long! Sorry for jumping on a soapbox! Hope that my 2 cents worth is worth something! :-)"	4.0	One of the best movies I've ever seen.	2006-06-30	36	27	9

I never saw a movie with Heath Ledger either. I thought he did an excellent job as a man in great conflict with his bi-sexual desires which were a death sentence in the early 60's. Also as with other reviewers, the problem with Ledger was that I could NOT UNDERSTAND 80% OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING! He seemed to be channeling Tommy Lee Jones' voice.SPOILER ALERT:Several things were not clear.1. Did Ennis's wife ever fully come out and tell him she knew of his relation with Jack?2. Did Jack's wife know how he really died? Or was the flat tire accident just a cover-up for the good of the family so there would not be a scandal ?3. Were Jack's ashes in the paper bag with the shirt his mom gave Ennis? Did Ennis take them to Brokeback Mountain?4. Heath Ledger mumbles. Does anyone know what he said at the end of the movie to Jack's shirt?I would give this movie a 5 having been compelled to watch it so many times. I give it a 4 for unanswered questions and the difficulty in understanding Ennis's dialogue.	4.0	Straight, (former) Republican Really Liked This Movie!	2006-12-15	20	10	10

At some level, I guess, it's just a matter of adding my affirmation to what others have said. My most enthusiastic affirmation. This is a great film. It's not great just because the acting is good. Though it is. It's not great just because the cinematography is wonderful. Though it is. It's not great just because it puts a taboo subject on the big screen at a time when Americans need to face a whole variety of realities about themselves. Though you bet it does that too.It's great because the story just makes sense. Annie Proulx has looked into an unfortunate aspect of American culture - our reticence to acknowledge that love and affection doesn't fit into easy, cultural-correct cubicles - and she's told a story that in one way or another must have been lived and relived again and again by a great many people. All the characters in this movie get full and sympathetic treatment. Yes, that begins with Ennis and Jack, but it goes beyond them to include everyone unfortunate enough to be caught up in the repressive society this film details. They're all victims - wives and children included. And it just makes sense! You can totally understand why people would live the lives these characters do, unable to love themselves or those around them naturally, because of pressures from a close-minded, fearful society.I came home from this film wondering if other actors could've done a better job than Ledger and Gyllenhaal, only to find an old Mel Gibson movie on the box. I was painfully aware of how poor an actor someone like Gibson is in comparison to these two young, talented men. I was also painfully aware of how brave they are, and how someone like Gibson would never have done a film like this. It actually makes me - usually a cynic when it comes to Hollywood - enthusiastic about the future of mainstream American filmmaking. Every now and then we get something right.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A18M68DE1Y6W51	Wendy Kaplan	"I am speechless at the utter brilliance of this beautiful movie, which I had missed in the theaters, to my great regret. Having read Annie Proulx's short story from which the movie was taken first, I can testify to the movie's phenomenally accurate, delicate and moving translation into film.What angers me beyond belief is all the adolescent, giggly jokes we had to endure for how many weeks? On every late-night show, and even at the Oscars themselves, absolutely everybody had a ""gay cowboy"" joke. But that's not what this story is about at all. Not even close.The intense unbreakable bond between Jack and Ennis examines the very essence of being human. Meeting at age 19, each has already been weathered by unspeakably harsh conditions, both environtally and spiritually. Ennis barely speaks. Jack is guarded and wary. On a summer looking after sheep in a starkly remote area of Wyoming, they are the only two human beings on the planet. And a bond between them forms and grows into something neither wants, but neither can break.Gosh, yuck yuck, let's get Jay Leno to make some more jokes! Or maybe, just maybe, those who haven't seen this movie can put aside their preordained ""opinions"" and just watch it unfold.Incredible directing by Ang Lee, incredible writing, spectacular photography and acting (Heath Ledger is incredibly talented as Ennis, in what might be the role of his career, but all the actors are superb), and lush, gorgeous music are all part of the whole--Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece.My one tiny criticism of the DVD itself is that the music seems to drown out the dialogue, some of which is so soft that it is impossible to hear without turning the volume way up. Believe me, this is a small criticism and not enough to turn anyone away from this incredible movie."	5.0	Moving, Brilliant, Memorable	2006-04-17	39	33	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1O60Q7LBN4MQ	Wendy Schroeder	I thought Heath Ledger was excellent and was definitely his movie. I thought it was sad that at that time and place that two people who love each other can't be together without people making it their business, which Ledger's character Ennis Del Mar was worried about. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) was the outgoing of the two. He didn't care, he was willing to take the chance. They both ended up getting married, Ennis was divorced later. His wife found out their secret early.It's kind of a sad story and I felt for both of them but it was Ennis who my heart went out to. It's a worthwhile movie to see if you are open minded and willing to set through a fairly long movie that tells it's story slowly.	4.0	Both my husband and I liked it	2006-08-03	12	9	3

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A17JVVAKWEB0M	Wesley Mullins	"In a town that could not be smaller and under a sky that could not be greater, Ennis and Jack find each other.  Out of work cattle hands, both make their way to the same rancher's office.  They get assigned to Brokeback Mountain, wrangling a herd of sheep so large it seems to stretch from Texas to Canada.  After many weeks with only each other's companionship and one night of heavy drinking, the two suddenly and violently have sex.I assume viewers know that is coming, as much as they knew Jesus was doomed in Mel Gibson's picture.  Brokeback Mountain has already become a cultural phenomenon as ""the gay cowboy"" film, so everyone knows the two will eventually play ""hide the lasso"".  Two things about that introduction surprised me.  First, I did not expect the shepherding to be presently so beautifully.  The two men and the endless herd of sheep echoes the relationship of Gus and Call from Lonesome Dove (another story penned by Larry McMurtry) as they drive cattle to Montana.  The vistas fill the screen with a world of infinite space and glory, with two little cowboys as only specs hidden among the evergreens and icy ponds.The second surprise for me was the lack of tenderness in their relationship before they had sex.  Someone not expecting them to become lovers will be shocked, as nothing suggests they have those feelings.  They just wake up in the middle of the night and go at it.  Maybe that's a heterosexual's opinion, because if one of the boys had been camped out with Natalie Portman that long, I would have expected some action much sooner.The film suggests this isn't Jack's first rodeo (apropos because he does ride bulls).  Although the lines between classifications blur, Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) seems to be easy to identify as a bi-sexual.  He has relationships (and just sex) with other men during the film, but as with Ennis, he also goes on to marry, have children and enjoy sex with women enough to cheat on his wife with other females.The enigmatic Ennis (Heath Ledger) shatters labels.  He seems to be a straight male who also likes to have sex with Jack...just Jack.  He is uninterested in other men, and viewers may assume he would never have stumbled into another homosexual relationship had Jack not sought him out.  Is it just that he loves Jack?  Maybe.  But he also seems almost content without him.This love/hate relationship Ennis has for Jack will lead some to view Jack as an instigator, and he clearly isn't as sympathetic as Ennis (Gene Shalit recently described him as a sexual predator, which isn't a baseless accusation).  Ennis is hard to understand completely, everything he does contradicts something else.  He's obviously torn and seems to allow that indecisiveness to contribute to more pain for himself and others.Clearly, the film sees the tragedy in homophobia.  These two men love each other, but they are unable to be together, to spend their lives as happy as those nights on Brokeback Mountain.  But the film also shows how the pain is not exclusive to the men.  Families are ruined, and women are left believing they are somehow inadequate.  This idea seems to be as much a swipe against gays who try to live as straight males as against homophobia.I found the middle part of the film to be a bit long.  Doom was obviously approaching, and it took a little too long to arrive.  One less summer on Brokeback Mountain and one less jilted female could have made for a more thrifty and enjoyable narrative.MILD SPOILERS AHEAD:The ending was surprisingly touching for me.  It ends with the two destined to never see each other again.  In a search for truth and closure, one of the men seeks out the family of the other and hears how his lover used to speak of the love they shared.  Hearing those romanticized visions of what could have been juxtaposes against the reality of their world, one that would never accept the men for who they were.  A Romeo and Juilet for the 21st Century?  Maybe.I liked this film more than I expected, but what I won't like will be the beast it will become.  In the next few months, as it breaks the bank at the box office and wins everything from the Oscars to the MTV Awards, the film will become the bible of the gay rights movement.  Those of us who don't follow their platform will be paralleled to the Randy Quaid character, evil in all ways, including his homophobia.  Those like Shalit who see problems with the film will be shouted down, as dissent will not be tolerated.  You can either love this film or you can be classified as a bigoted homophobe.  That idea frightens me."	4.0	"A western where ""the good guys get it in the end"""	2006-01-09	20	14	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A4UKBG3M5U5TI	Westley	"""Brokeback Mountain"" opened in a few large cities and has slowly rolled out into the rest of the country.  Along the way, it's picked up nominations from nearly every critics group and for every award possible.  Thus, when some people across the country finally have the opportunity to view ""Brokeback Mountain,"" it will have been built up incredibly.  I'm sure many people are very eager to see the ""gay cowboy"" movie that's winning so many awards.  Unfortunately, I think some people may be disappointed.  ""Brokeback Mountain"" is ultimately a small film, even if it does break some barriers.  There have been hundreds of successful gay films, but somehow this one, largely because it twists the western mythos of macho straight cowboys, has already attained almost mythical stature.  But please remember that it's a small, leisurely-paced movie.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play the cowboys, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist.  In 1963, they're hired by a rancher to watch a flock of sheep on a forlorn mountaintop. Indeed, both have lead pretty desolate lives - Ennis was orphaned early, and Jack's father was a cruel jerk, as we witness later.  Being a cowboy was obviously a hard life and the best they can hope for is to get some steady ranch work.  Long days together lead to the inevitable small talk and whiskey drinking as well as something else unforeseen - sex.However, whatever surprise the two men feel about having sex together seems dwarfed by the shock that they've found something in each other that they've never found anyplace else.  Different viewers may disagree about what Ennis and Jack see in each other; some may see the acceptance between the men or the end to their loneliness that they find together.  Whatever it is, they never find it again.  After the leave the mountain, they separate - Ennis marries quickly and Jack eventually follows suit.  Four years passes before they see each other again; unexpectedly to them, their feelings for each other are completely undiminished.  So begins a 20 plus year relationship marked with yearning that will never be satisfied.To some audiences, this film will just be a gay love story.  However, I think it's much closer in tone to one of Ang Lee's prior films, ""Sense and Sensibility.""  Jane Austen specialized in love stories where characters' longing to be together is often outweighed by the price of being together.  At one point, Jack offers to spend his life with Ennis, but Ennis, always the more pragmatic of the two, knows that two men living together in 1960s Wyoming would be nearly impossible.In all aspects, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is finely wrought.  Ang Lee's direction is up to his usual high standard, and the cinematography is breath-taking.  The script is from Pulitizer winner Annie Proulx's fine short story and was adapted by another Pulitzer winner, Larry McMurtry.  In many ways, the film's simple portrait of the West is similar to McMurty's work in classics such as ""Hud"" and ""The Last Picture Show.""  The supporting cast is uniformly good, including Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway.  However, the revelation is truly Heath Ledger.  Aside from his work as the son of a racist in 2001's ""Monster Ball,"" he hasn't shown much acting promise.  Nevertheless, he perfectly captures Ennis.  He's likely to be nominated for an Oscar and perhaps even challenge Philip Seymour Hoffman ""(""Capote"") for the win.  Indeed, it's likely that ""Brokeback Mountain"" will win more than a few Oscars this year, and it's most worthy of the attention."	5.0	Crouching Cowboy, Hidden Love	2006-01-06	28	23	5

In our time it's not so much a painting as it is and in the future will be certain films.  This is one of those films.  It's not groundbreaking as one is often lead to believe because it's not really approaching the idea of love that differently.  When two people are in love there is nothing that can stop the expression of that love.  This is an example of that desire to jump the hurdles.  Someone said that the two shirts that went on sale on ebay and sold for 101,000 dollars was because they were the ruby slippers of our time.  Well I believe is film is the Romeo and Juliet of our time, and who cannot help but fall under the spell of that.That said,  I've read all about the mumbling (from those below) that Heath Ledger did during his performance.  The mumbling is suppose to represent is inability to let go and be with his lover, it is the phyiscal manifestation of the feelings inside.As for Jake his performance is so honest, so urgent.  His need to be with Ennis is so powerful that he'll risk everything.The rest of the cast is supurb and the story is faithful to the amazing short story.  The direction from Ang Lee is as usual impecable and awe inspiring.It will break your heart but it will also remind why we risk our heart in the first place.  For those few moments not where you're waiting to begin what is suppose to be the ""happy part of the rest of your life"" but the happy moments we have for just a moment with that one person we can't live without."	5.0	Art	2007-06-22	22	20	2

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1ER0YOOJSOMKX	William Carey	"In my view, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the most meaningful and important film to be made in my lifetime.  That is saying a lot, seeing I broke into the movie theater business as a projectionist at age 15, became a film exhibitor at age 17, and my 76th birthday is coming up in a few days.  I've seen a lot of movies!I'm a gay man - have been all my life.  But that's like saying ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a ""gay cowboy movie.""  It doesn't begin to tell the whole story.""Brokeback Mountain"" hit me like a lightning bolt.  I lived 50 years before I began to see anything representative of my life on any ""silver"" screen anywhere.  I lived over 75 years to see anything honest and real about gay men's lives in a movie.  That movie was ""Brokeback Mountain.""So much of my own life is depicted in ""Brokeback Mountain.""  I fell in love with a boy in high school.  He never knew; I never told him.  I longed for him in silence.  In 1948, where I lived, a boy didn't tell another boy he loved him.  My secret love still haunted me when I got married at age 23 - because it never occurred to me that I could escape marriage.I had a number of affairs with men during fifteen years of marriage, which astoundingly nobody, including my wife, picked up on.  When the burden of lies got to be too heavy to carry, I told my wife I was gay.  She and 3 children paid the price of societal intolerance when this happened.  This follows the story line of ""Brokeback Mountain"" to a spooky degree - and this is why the film will doubtless change the rest of my life.  I know that at last people who would never know what gay men have gone through - and still do go through - now know because ""Brokeback Mountain"" came into their lives.  I find great comfort in that."	5.0	Brokeback Mountain	2006-02-26	31	21	10

Worth seeing once, it is an honorable effort to portray the power of forbidden love between two modern-day cowboys who would obviously vote Republican on all but gay issues, and perhaps even on some of those. Now that the film is a couple of years old, I think it is safe to reveal that one of the leads does not survive the film. That was the most disappointing part...we come to care about the men, yet one passes from this world with only the briefest of depictions. I was surprised it did not win the Oscar as best film, but the awards were given out before I saw the movie. Now that I have seen it, I think it can be fairly called one of the ten best films of its year, and one of the three most talked about, but not deserving of the top honor for its season. Good performances for sure, but the script could have used some trimming and some punch.	4.0	Almost a masterpiece, but not for everybody's taste...	2006-10-03	26	6	20
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2ASIT0JYIGHTA	William	This was one of the most heartfelt films I have seen in recent years. The story of undying forbidden love in a time when it just was not accepted by society. It should be seen by all, and particularly  for the beautiful cinematography. It is however, not without faults.  Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is the role of Heath Ledger whose attempt at an American cowboy accent is so off the mark that it actually is very annoying to listen to throughout the film.  Heath mumbles his way through his role, and while he has touches of brilliance, I question why he was chosen.  Jake Gynenhaal, on the other hand, was simply brilliant and convincing throughout.Overall, a fascinating, brilliant film but let down by Heath Ledger.	4.0	Brilliant film ... but	2006-07-31	17	4	13

You'd think that 'professional people' would know better.Check out Heath and Jake's previous work, pretty impressive for a couple of 25 yr olds.

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1IFHFXIHESV28	"William M. Feagin ""music dealer/geek"""	"Brokeback Mountain is the story of two cowboys, Ennis Delmar and Jack Twist, hired in the summer of 1963 to tend to a herd of sheep in the mountains of Wyoming.  Ennis is unfailingly, unflinchingly played by Heath Ledger--and if he doesn't take the Oscar for Best Actor, I will truly be shocked--a character who could easily have stepped whole and breathing off the pages of a good Western novel (think Louis L'Amour, Zane Grey, Edward Abbey or even Michael Gear), every inch the stoic man of few words.  Jack (the excellent Jake Gyllenhaal--check him out in October Skies and The Day After Tomorrow, among other films) is a more voluble character, frisky and chatty, but also deeply sympathetic...and fated, as you will see if you watch the film.There is a great deal of tension between them from the film's beginning, when we first meet Ennis and Jack as they wait by the boss-man's trailer to find out the low-down on the job.  Jack watches Ennis discretely; Ennis remains impassive, appearing to take no notice of Jack at all.  They are sent up to Brokeback Mountain, and all seems normal until one night, when Ennis decides to sleep outside the tent (which they don't often share, as one usually remains with the sheep while the other minds their camp).  Jack sees that Ennis is freezing and commands him to come inside the tent--after mere minutes of body heat, the chemistry explodes into violent lovemaking (by which I mean intense, explosive, urgent).Despite this, the two remain in denial about their relationship (""God knows we ain't queers,"" says Ennis), yet it clearly affects them both deeply, Ennis with perhaps greater turmoil--as they part ways at the end of that first summer, he dashes into an alley between two buildings in the Wyoming hamlet below the mountain and is violently sick.  After Ennis' marriage to Alma, his fiancee, this denied tendency shows up briefly in their marriage (there is a sex scene in which Ennis flips Alma over on her stomach and takes her from behind, despite her choked protests), and Alma surreptitiously discovers the truth of her husband's relationship with Jack when they are reunited in 1967, having not seen each other for four years, and tearfully ponders how she's going to handle this awful knowledge.Over the years, the two men get together infrequently--Jack always going to Ennis, never the other way round--and both wind up getting divorces from their respective spouses.  The tension of their relationship shows up in all manner of ways (when Ennis fights a man in the street after a nasty argument with Alma, or Jack's disagreement with his father-in-law over whether his son should be allowed to watch football during Thanksgiving dinner--Jack wins that one); Ennis is frightened and conflicted by their relationship, while Jack's heart clearly aches and yearns for Ennis.  That this is never resolved makes the ending all the more poignant and painful.It helps to remember that, in 1963 when the film begins, homosexuality was still considered a mental illness (not taken off the books until 1973, four years after the Gay Rights Movement began in earnest), so Ennis' fears are well-grounded.  But the heart wants what it wants, and sometimes getting it requires the ultimate sacrifice.  This film gives us that lesson in painful yet memorable detail; all the performances are excellent, even Randy Quaid's turn as Jack and Ennis' boss at Brokeback...truly a man of his time.  Run--don't walk--to the nearest cinema where this is playing, and see Brokeback Mountain.  Otherwise, you haven't lived."	5.0	An amazing film...you won't soon forget it!	2006-03-03	19	14	5
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"I've added to and slightly revised this review, and appended comments about the Blu-ray edition.I've waited almost two years to review this film: it took me that long to work up the courage to watch ""Crash"", the viewing of which seemed a prerequisite for my claiming any degree of objectivity or intellectual honesty in reviewing ""Brokeback"". (I've posted a review of that film, as well.) I also wanted to be certain I'd found the right things to say and the right way to say them. There are so many things to discuss about ""Brokeback Mountain"" they could fill a book. Hopefully, someone will write one (qv, Jerome Agel's ""The Making of Kubrick's 2001"", a fine book about another controversial film).Of all the reviews, pro or con, the most-significant came from World Net Daily, an ultra-far-right religious publication. You'd expect its ""Brokeback Mountain"" review to be titled something like ""Hollywood Liberals Aggressively Promote Homosexual Agenda"". But, no -- it's ""Rape of the Marlboro Man"". (Yes!) The review argues that homosexuals are trying to appropriate the upright, decent, manly image of the cowboy to encourage acceptance of their own debased/depraved/perverted views of manhood.One doesn't have to know much Western history to recognize that the traditional view of the cowboy as ""the man on the white horse"" doesn't bear close examination. Cowboys were rough-living men who drank, gambled, and whored with little restraint.Cowboys and other Westerners were often solitary men - that's always been part of their mystique. (See ""The Myth of the American Superhero"" by Lawrence & Jewett.) Many left the East to get away from society, from government, from social pressures (including those to marry). From ""The Last of the Mohicans"" to ""Lonesome Dove"", frontiersmen have been laconic loners. (Well... Gus McCrae isn't exactly laconic. But Woodrow F Call makes up for it.)Cowboys and other western pioneers lived in an overwhelmingly homosocial environment. Whores provided a convenient sexual outlet, whereas marriage brought with it social fetters. Men therefore looked to other men for companionship -- and sometimes other things.The emotionally intimate relationships of Western males has been written about for a century and a half. Mark Twain observed homosexual behavior among prospectors. Charles Badger Clark's ""The Lost Pardner"", one of the all-time most-popular cowboy poems, outlines the near-sexual -- and explicitly misogynistic * -- relationship of two wranglers. Yet heterosexual males read it without embarrassment -- or seeming awareness of the poem's implications -- because the truth it speaks about intense male friendships likely masks its truth about male sexuality. Clark's ""Bachin'"" extols the delights of a female-free life (""...in our trouble list we never count a wife""). Its opening line -- ""Our ways are hid; our trails are strange"" -- and the later ""Each has a reason why he's lone, but keeps it 'neath his hat"" ares suggestive. Clark's less-familiar poem ""My Enemy"" ends with the adversaries not only making up, but also apparently making out. The implication is subtle, but Clark's writing shows such a consistently careful choice of words that it's difficult to read the meaning of ""and when dark found us limp and jaded"" otherwise.Several Bret Harte stories express a startling homoeroticism. The men of ""Tennessee's Partner"" and ""In the Tules"" share a love for each other that's ""consummated"" only in the afterlife. The implied ""marriage"" of Tennessee and his male partner did not prevent this story from becoming one of Harte's most-popular, probably because it was written toward the end of an era when it was not uncommon for men to express effusive love for each other, and the Romantic fancy of lovers uniting in death had not yet faded. ""Tennessee's Partner"" is a fine example of hiding something in plain sight.If ""Brokeback Mountain"" deviates from our view of the West, that view is the view presented by Hollywood and TV -- not the view of the people who actually lived and worked in the West. You cannot truly ""rape"" (in any sense of the word) someone or something that never existed.The inconvenient truths are... Men like sex. When women aren't around (and sometimes when they are), they'll have it with each other. And -- yes -- even unerringly masculine men will engage in mutual sodomy (as Jack and Ennis do), however unbelievable that might seem to heterosexual males reading this. (I speak from direct experience.) ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a gut punch to the American view of what constitutes ""masculinity"", which is why it attracted the outrage of groups and people that might otherwise ignore films with homosexual characters or themes.Those who'd like to investigate this subject in greater depth should read ""Queer Cowboys"" by Chris Packard and ""Male-Male Intimacy in Early America"" by William Benemann.Larry McMurtry has famously said ""the story was just sitting there, waiting to be told"". (For a writer notorious for demythologizing the West, why hadn't _he_ told it? **) Yet it /has/ been told, many times. ""Brokeback Mountain"" doesn't stand in isolation, but is firmly in the tradition of stories about frontiersmen sharing marriage-like relationships with indigenous males or other frontiersmen. *** ""Brokeback Mountain"" is simply the first time a serious writer has told that story without ignoring or ""coding"" its sexual elements. ****Larry McMurtry bragged about using virtually all the dialog from the short story. This is not true. Some significant material was removed, such as Ennis telling Jack of the overwhelming sexual attraction he feels for him, and Jack's telling Ennis why he finds sodomy with him so pleasurable. (I asked a bisexual horseman whether Jack's understanding of the physiology involved was correct, and he said it was.)McMurtry's novels don't shy away from sex, but he isn't interested in graphic depictions, and ""Brokeback Mountain""'s film treatment reflects this. As late as a year before filming began, the screenplay had the camera coyly averting its eye as Ennis mounted Jack.But McMurtry doesn't limit himself to avoiding graphic sex -- he tries to de-sexualize the story. Though Annie Proulx describes Jack and Ennis as engaging in hot, sweaty sex up on Brokeback, the film shows them only briefly rolling around -- and that through Aguirre's binoculars. More significantly, the screenplay omits an important moment in their final tryst -- Jack putting his hand between Ennis's thighs to warm it, while Ennis unbuttons Jack's shirt.These omissions support the only valid criticism of the film -- it's overly reserved. Its basic reserve is a good thing -- the story easily lends itself to overwrought melodrama. Had the direction or acting been not so restrained, the effect would have been ludicrous, and ""Brokeback Mountain"" would have died a quick and unlamented death.But the restraint is excessive. The film fails to fully show what the short story makes clear -- 20 years haven't dimmed Ennis and Jack's crude lust for each other. We need to see them, on that final camping trip, pulling each other's clothes off and wrestling in front of the fire, kissing each other as violently as they had in front of Ennis's apartment. This scene would make their final argument and Ennis's ultimate acknowledgement of their mutual love all the more poignant and pathetic (in the good sense).As fine as Ang Lee's direction is (it's equivalent to walking on snow without leaving footprints), Peter Bogdanovich might have been a bit less ""arty"" and might have better caught the intensity of Ennis and Jack's relationship, without stepping over the line into melodrama. (Think of the pool-table scene in ""The Last Picture Show"".) And in the fantasy world of ""if only"", imagine the same script and actors directed by Alfred Hitchcock, with a Bernard Herrmann score. (Before you protest, note that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is, thematically, very much a Hitchcock story.)The religious right would like people to believe movie reviewers are a liberal lot consciously promoting ""the homosexual agenda"", and that ""Brokeback Mountain"" provided the perfect opportunity. Rubbish. Reviewers -- even those as intellectually shallow and confused as Michael Medved -- recognized a great film when they saw it. ""Brokeback Mountain"" speaks a truth many people want to suppress -- men become emotionally involved with each other, and have sex with each other, just as men and women do.Indeed -- and I emphasize this point to any uncomfortable hetereo males who've read this far -- men can and do have intense emotional relationships with each other /without/ sexual desire. I've had such relationships with hetero men, and know there are many straight guys out there who want emotional -- though not sexual -- intimacy with other men. Unfortunately, they often have to go to queer men for it, because most hetero men are just too cowardly.But is ""Brokeback Mountain"" _truly_ a great film? Well, it's an /iconic film -- as iconic as 2001, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Casablanca, Chinatown, Citizen Kane, King Kong, Network (another Best Picture loser), The Maltese Falcon, Snow White, or The Wizard of Oz. Great films aren't necessarily iconic -- but an iconic film is, by definition, great. *****""Brokeback Mountain"" has also entered pop culture, perhaps indelibly, even among people who haven't seen the film. When a female reporter used ""Brokeback"" references in a piece about Vladimir Putin's bare-chested fishing expedition, few there were who didn't get the joke. And ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" is likely to become a lasting catch phrase, just as ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" and ""I'm shocked... shocked!"" have.So why did ""Brokeback Mountain"" lose Best Picture? If Tony Curtis and Ernest Borgnine hadn't opened their stupid traps, the answer might have remained equivocal. But it seems that ""Crash"" -- a film with mixed reviews that appeared on few best-picture lists -- was nominated to provide an alternative for those who had personal (rather than artistic) reasons for rejecting ""Brokeback Mountain"".Tony Curtis (nee, Bernard Schwartz) -- who has unapologetically admitted to having sex with men (see the Wikipedia bio) -- should have _some_ feeling for what it means to belong to a discriminated-against minority. Both he and Mr. Borgnine have worked with gay men and women (on both sides of the camera), and ought to have the common sense to realize that attacking ""Brokeback Mountain"" -- on other than artistic grounds -- was a slap in the face to their queer colleagues. ****** Despite Mr. Borgnine's averral that John Wayne would not have tolerated ""Brokeback Mountain"", I suspect ""The Duke"" -- assuming the film truly did offend him -- would simply have kept his mouth shut (at least in public).An anti-parallel could be drawn with the 1947 Best-Picture winner, ""Gentleman's Agreement"", an intelligent film about anti-Semitism, though hardly of the quality justifying a Best-Picture nomination, let alone a win. But Hollywood's demographic is strongly Jewish, so it's not surprising it was nominated and won, simply because it corresponded with the interests of that demographic. ******* Imagine the reaction if a gentile actor had said he'd no intention of seeing the film because of its subject matter!""Hollywood"" had the opportunity to award ""Best Picture"" to a film that truly deserved the honor, if only because it disrupted the usual order of things, and did it so well. As a resepcted LA reviewer remarked the day following the ceremony, Hollywood had finally demonstrated (if any proof were needed) that the Academy Awards were meaningless.Is the Story Plausible?-----------------------It's significant that no one -- not even the most rabidly anti-gay fundamentalists -- has raised any objection to ""Brokeback Mountain""'s plausibility. Of course, fundamentalists /wouldn't/ object, as it would contradict their assertion that homosexual behavior is a consciously chosen perversion. The seeming naturalness of Ennis and Jack's attraction is arguably the most-disturbing thing about the story.Ennis and Jack's tale is completely plausible. People who think ""real men"" don't have sex with each other -- or God forbid -- kiss each other, or fall in love, don't know much about what goes on in the world. I've known queer men who would beat John Wayne in a butch-off and could cold-cock The Duke in a fair fight.An appreciation for the male physique -- which is only one step removed from sexual attraction -- is hardly uncommon among heterosexual males. (Heterosexual men engage in bodybuilding primarily to improve their looks, not their health.) I saw it in my 100%-hetero father's reaction to Douglas Fairbanks' (lack of) costume in ""The Thief of Bagdhad"". And highly sexed hetero males sometimes experiment with homosexual behavior. (I was publicly out in college, and two notoriously womanizing male acquaintances came on to me simply because they were curious.)Men are sometimes confused about their sexual orientation. I've met hetero men who told me they were afraid of waking up one morning and discovering they were queer. They likely had sexual feelings for other men they didn't understand or know how to handle.Ennis and Jack's mutual attraction is a normal thing, and doesn't need an explanation, any more than Rhett and Scarlett's does. And Scarlett's interest in Rhett is unabashedly sexual, but no one sees much wrong in that. (""He was a tall man and powerfully built. Scarlett thought she had never seen a man with such wide shoulders, so heavy with muscles, almost too heavy for gentility. ...his eyes were as bold and black as any pirate's appraising a galleon to be scuttled or a maiden to be ravished."") Which should be no surprise to anybody.Watching the film for a fifth or sixth time, on Blu-ray, I remain impressed with Michelle Williams's heartbreaking performance (particularly the short scene where Ennis cruelly dismisses their marriage, and she tells him what she's finally figured out), and the scene in which Jack's mother asks Ennis to come back. She wants to spend time with someone who truly loved her son -- which her appallingly nasty husband never did.Comments on the Music---------------------I was surprised at ""Brokeback Mountain"" winning Best Score, as there is so _little_ score. Yet, it is the _lack_ of scoring that contributes so much to ""Brokeback Mountain""'s dramatic punch -- it would be nowhere as good a film if it had a full score. It's probably the first film score to win an Oscar because of its non-existence.Bernard Herrmann famously said that the purpose of music is to establish an emotional connection between what's going on up on the screen and the audience -- the composer had to fill in what  the director could not or would not show. Herrmann was a master of film music because he focused on what was /not/ being said or shown. An outstanding example occurs in ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"" during the flashback of Gregory Peck killing a German soldier. In just a few bars of music, Herrmann conveys everything Peck is thinking and feeling.But most composers score much less imaginatively than Herrmann, merely underlining what we're seeing or hearing, rather than enhancing or complementing it. Too often the music /tells/ the audience how to react to the scene. That creates a distancing effect, where the emotion is conveyed more by the music than by the acting.In ""Brokeback Mountain"", the music is almost all atmosphere. There are no Leitmotivs (other than the melancholic guitar theme, which sometimes arrives to represent Ennis and Jack's relationship), and the music rarely underlines either thoughts or events. Consider Ennis and Jack's reunion, their ecstatic embrace, and Alma's appalled reaction to seeing her husband kissing another man with more passion than he's ever shown /her/. Though this scene seemingly cries out for music, there is none! We get the direct emotions of the situation, uncolored and unfiltered.This was likely intentional. Annie Proulx says she's not a ""sentimental"" writer; I suspect Ennis and Jack's relationship (which, let's be honest, is -- even at that point in the story -- far more sexual than romantic) would seem more than a little silly if it were ""enhanced"" by music.On the rare occasions when the music does reflect the scene's affect, Santaolalla's scoring is spare, subtle, and unclich&eacute;d. This is a remarkable score that shows, in an era where 70% or more of most films' running time is scored, how less can be more.Comments on DVD Quality-----------------------Projection quality in American theaters is generally mediocre or worse -- inadequate brightness, muddy/smeary/dirty prints, flat color, lack of overall sharpness, etc.DVDs and LVs tend to automatically ""look better"" than what we see in the theater, simply because removing the projection lens and screen improves sharpness/detail and increases contrast. Transfers from the negative (rather than an IP or projection print) effect further improvements in sharpness, detail, color accuracy, and saturation.But these improvements aren't always aesthetically desirable. The cinematographer normally lights the film knowing how what's front of the camera will ""translate"" to the final projection print. The biggest change is a loss of shadow detail, which can be used to advantage (eg, the substitution of a piece of cardboard for Robby's left leg in the final scene of ""Forbidden Planet""). When the DVD transfer restores the ""lost"" detail, we see things we weren't supposed to.For ""Brokeback Mountain"", these improvements work against the film. The generally dark, dingy quality of many scenes, that so fits the film's tone, is lightened, or lost altogether. Colors are now sometimes too bright and saturated, particularly in scenes where they shouldn't be. There's far too much shadow detail -- Aguirre's trailer office now looks relatively clean and neat, and Jack's family home not quite so dirty or run-down.Though there's now a ""deluxe"" multi-DVD edition, its transfer appears to be no different from the original single disk's. I hope someday the director and cinematographer - working from the negative -- will time each scene for the appropriate density, shadow detail, color saturation, etc. We need to see ""Brokeback Mountain"" as it was (probably) intended. The current DVD does not, as far as I can determine, present it properly.That's the DVD, of course. See the following remarks on the Blu-ray.Comments on Blu-ray Quality---------------------------I've remarked in other reviews that the /only/ way to see a movie is /at home/, from an HD source on a big display (50"" or larger). This couldn't be more true of ""Brokeback Mountain"".I saw the film twice theatrically, at different theaters. Particularly with the indoor scenes, the projection print was a muddy mess, though I felt at the time it was appropriate to the film's atmosphere. The DVD struck me (and a few other people) as overly clean-looking.The Blu-ray changes all that. We are now seeing (in effect) the camera negative, in high resolution. The most-significant improvement is not in sharpness and detail (though there are huge gains), but in tonality. The BD images truly capture what it's like to stand outside on an overcast day, or the feeling one has in someone's living room or kitchen. Annie Proulx says she writes stories about peoples' relationships with their environments (both physical and social), and the Blu-ray transfer captures Ennis and Jack's environments very well.Though dramas do not generally benefit much from high definition, this one is an exception.* Clark almost always represents relationships with women as encumbrances, or just plain unnecessary.** Though Gus and Woodrow are portrayed as close friends of many years' standing, their personalities -- the ever-randy, ever-whoring Gus, and the emotionally constipated ur-loner Woodrow -- seem consciously calculated to block the remotest possibility of anything sexual between them, even something as unthreatening to the sense of one's masculinity as ""a chaw fer a chaw"". After reading ""Dead Man's Walk"" and ""Comanche Moon"", you conclude that two such utterly different people couldn't possibly have been the lifelong friends they're portrayed as in ""Lonesome Dove"".*** While we're at it, let's throw in ""The Epic of Gilgmamesh"". The Gilgmamesh / Enkidu relationship is intensely homoerotic and vehemently misogynistic. Their society did not proscribe sexual relations between men; the Mitchell realization gives alternate versions that indicate they engaged in mutual sodomy.**** Richard Amory's classic ""Loon"" novels, though well-written, don't count. Though giving the illusion of reality -- Amory appears to have known far more about the realities of living in the wild than J. F. Cooper ever did -- they're fantasies set in an all-male world.***** An iconic short story became an iconic film. The current consensus is that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is not only the best short story ""The New Yorker"" has yet published, but one of the greatest American short stories, period. Without intending to, Annie Proulx hit the nail on the head. It's the work she will most-likely be remembered for.****** In ""If Chins Could Kill"", Bruce Campbell offers high praise for Ernest Borgnine's professionalism. But his professionalism apparently doesn't extend to having the sense not to defecate in your own nest.******* The 1947 Academy Award nominations were filled with ironies. ""Crossfire"" was also about anti-Semitism -- a soldier is murdered simply because he's Jewish -- but the film is based on the novel ""The Brick Foxhole"", in which the victim is homosexual. And the author of ""Gentleman's Agreement"", Laura Z. Hobson, would later pen ""Consenting Adult"", a novel about her gay son's coming out."	5.0	Inconvenient truths...

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A22776IR7025AV	Willow Heidenberg	Brokeback Mountain is a movie so ahead of our time that people are yet able to keep up with it.Allow me to explain myself.A few centuries ago, marriage is about power and benefits. Familys wed off their daughters to the rich and powerful so that they may receive the benefits of that marriage. Social classes are also very strictly governed, but eventually, human beings found that all people are equal, and abandoned the status system. Now, because the Church is homophobic, it exercises a cult-like exercise and brainwash everyone into thinking that homosexuality should be condemned. But when the emotions are so strong, it will outgrow all social conditionings. This movie shows the cruelty we have created the world to be, but unfortunately, people have yet become so accepting. Perhaps if the movie is released a few decades later, people will not be so small minded, and will embrace this movie for the love story it holds.	5.0	When Emotions Outgrows Social Conditioning	2006-06-04	27	21	6
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A3JS9RSN8CQ0DA	willow	"I put off seeing this film, unsure how the subject would be handled.  What a mistake!  This is absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is superbly acted - Heath Ledger puts forth the best acting I have ever seen, and I've seen plenty! Direction, music, cinematography - all amazing. It left me wrung out and haunted.  It portrays such an intense, palpable love, yet as I thought about it afterwards, I don't believe there is a single ""I love you"" uttered in the entire film.  Made me think about how talk is cheap! I am strictly a ""renter"" when it comes to movies, but I am buying this one because I know I'll want to see it many times. While some think that the the story ignores the pain of the families of the two men, or that their love is used as a justification of the pain they cause, I say ""au contraire"" - you've got it backwards!  The pain is deeply felt - however the CAUSE of the pain is NOT the relationship between the men. It is caused by a society where people are forced to deny their true feelings and are obligated to lead ""acceptable"" heterosexual lives."	5.0	One of the best films I have ever seen	2006-03-27	64	54	10
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A366RUJHZQGQ5G	WineGuy	"Funny and sad how some ""reviewers"" here showed their hatred towards this movie simply because of their ideology.  It was pretty obvious that some people who hate this movie did not even see the movie.  What is the point of turning this section into a preaching opportunity?????  Ang Li has said before that he did not make this movie to make a statement.  It is a movie, a piece of cinema work, and it should be reviewed just like a movie, with open mind.I saw the movie and read the original story.  I think the director and the actors did a very good job, except that I thought the editing was a bit choppy.  It is not just about men, it is about women too (Michelle William's role is just as heart wrenching as the relationship between Enis and Jack).Being a metro gay man myself, yes it is easier for me to feel the connection, yet most of my straight friends, male or female, think this is a really well made movie as well, forget about who agrees on the gay issue or not.  The true matter is the movie is good.  It is on my top three list for 2005 but not the top two.  In a way, I guess because I am a gay boy, I am somewhat used to the issue.  I rank this movie behind ""Capote"" and ""The Constant Gardener"" for the year.  That's why I did not give it a five star."	4.0	Review the movie only, please.......	2006-01-31	8	4	4
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A1SPB225CVTRUU	"Wing Lee ""filmfan"""	"First of all, I am so relieved that I have finally seen this film after so much anticipation, and I was moved to tears as I had expected. It's been so long since I have been so taken by a romantic movie, and Brokeback Mountain is as beautiful and emotionally impacting as films like Happy Together(Tony Leung), Intimates(Carina Lau), and The English Patient(Ralph Fiennes). It's such a treat to see Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger under the meticulous direction of Ang Lee. I agree with Lee that this film is a beautiful love story and not a gay cowboy movie.Brokeback Mountain uses the beautiful mountain landscape of Alberta as a stand in for the Wyoming mountains. It's the place where Jack(Gyllenhaal) and Ennis(Ledger) spent their first year in the mid '60s working together as cowboys tending the sheeps. The two lonesome cowboys clashed at first, but eventual became friends and secret lovers. Jack is the sexy and rebellious one, and Ennis is emotionally and sexually confused. At first, they didn't want to acknowledge their feelings for each other, until they were separated for four years, and started to miss each other. During those four years, they both got married and led a ""normal life"", and had kids. Ennis' wife Alma(Michelle Williams) eventually found out that he's cheating on her with Jack, but never actually confronted him until years later. Jack had been relocated to Texas since marrying the beautiful and wealthy Laureen(Anne Hathway).When Jack and Ennis were reunited, it reignited their old passion and lust for each other, and occasionally went up to Brokeback Mountain to have their secret romantic getaways while pretending to be on fishing trips. Jack's feeling for Ennis grew stronger gradually, and suggested to move away and live together. But Ennis has homophobia of his own and fear any possible alienation and condemnation, and just wanted to keep it a ""once in a blue moon"" deal. So time passes by, and twenty years later, they are both middle aged men, still going through the same old pattern. Jack becomes resentful towards Ennis, because he had wasted half of his life loving him and not having him entirely, even when he had already been divorced from Alma for years.This film features a scene stealing Michelle Williams. The scene when Alma saw Ennis kissing and hugging Jack outside her house was so funny and shocking. She was mesmerizing when she had her heart-to-heart confrontation with Ennis. Anne Hathway has less screentime and a less challenging role to work with, and she gets to wear different kinds of wigs. Her final scene when she breaks the tragic news to Ennis was her big moment. I enjoyed watching every scene between Jake and Heath. I actually like Jake's character more, because he knew what he wanted and was not afraid to love the man of his life. I was very moved by his final scene, which was kind of long, but the most dramatic between the two leads. I wished Jake had a few more stronger scenes to work with. It's Heath who actually got the most tear-jerking moments, and yes, his performance is compelling, and heartbreaking, especially the last fifteen minutes.Ang Lee had done a great job making this film visually stunning and emotionally powerful, even though the love scenes are rather low-key. The cinematography captures the most beautiful images of the mountains, sheeps, rivers, and lakes. The original score and theme song are quite memorable. This film is going to have a huge following of gay audiences, but it's also a must-see for the mainstream crowds, because it's truly the year's most unforgetable romantic movie!"	5.0	Jake and Heath!	2005-12-16	20	17	3
1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	A2EI6VK5MMYP0K	"WLP ""Dillinger"""	"Well, where to begin...Dear reader, I'm sure that with the amount of reviews available, that my one will probably not have a great impact. Nevertheless, this review serves also a selfish purpose, it is cathartic. So here goes.I've never been moved as much by a film than I was with BBM. I hadn't really heard of it, other than the (awful) epithet ""the gay cowboy movie"". Having seen the film, I had to own the book and read the short story. The film carefully follows the storyline and elaborates only where necessary. The book, as well, complements the film. There are only minor discrepancies. However, having both read the book and seen the film, this review is based on both.Let me get this straight. I'm not a fan of love stories, and Titanic was a boring session to me. I've never been a chick flick film goer. Which is why I was so surprised and confused at the same time by my reaction to the promotional trailer to BBM. The trailer connected with something deep within me (and, no, it wasn't the part of wanting to have sex with a guy), but it was the fact that it genuinely purveyed a different take on masculinity. Because yes, this film is 100% a study about masculinity, if not machism. So, I wanted to enlighten myself as to how men can be different, yet still manly nevertheless. It was very refreshing to see something different in regards to homosexuality than Will and Grace. I love the fact that this isn't about two guys who meet up in the local gay bar whilst dancing away to Madonna.The key issue is the masculinity of the main characters' sexuality. As one critic accurately put it, we don't know whether Ennis and Jack (the main characters) are gay because the love each other, or whether they love each other because they are gay. Heath Ledger described Ennis as a homophobic man in love with another man. Jake Gyllenhaal even said he thought this was a film about two straight guys who fall in love with each other. Of course, this quote isn't entirely unproblematic, but I have sympathy for it. Their masculinity defines their sexuality, and they love all things masculine and being masculine themselves. In essence, this is a story about men who prefer the company of men  as opposed to women, and there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, I dare postulate that the only way this story is different from a story about two very good male friends is the fact that they have sex. According to Annie Proulx's short story in the story to screenplay book, it was common practice to send two ranch hands out at the same time, so that if they couldn't poke at the livestock, at least they could poke at each other. Usually, what happened on the mountain stayed on the mountain. Yet Ennis and Jack fall in love subsequently, which complicates thins altogether.However, the real novelty is that the story is available to the public at large. We see/read things that usually wouldn't be shown in public. Such as the more tender occasions, for instance the embrace by the fireplace, where the issue is not so much sex, as it is emotional connection. This, in my opinion, is far more intense on the reader/viewer than any sex scenes, and far more novel (dare one say controversial, even?). And yet, why is it so strange to society at large to see two guys share a moment of tenderness? Women do it all the time; they kiss, hug, sleep together (not in a sexual manner), cry together, go to the toilet together etc. This is not so with men. But why shouldn't it be between good friends or family? And I can't see why it should be something that might label someone as being gay, because in my view, people are only gay if they desire somebody of their own gender sexually. Women who hug and kiss aren't necessarily lesbians for that matter, so why should men think that they are?These are some of the more interesting questions about men and women that the story offers. It has definitely led me to review my own position on masculinity and what it is to be a straight guy. And also, the story has cemented the fact that masculinity is not reserved solely for straight men. &Uuml;ber-gay macho men aside, such as the Village People, gay guys can be as rough-spoken, stoic and reserved as any.The symbolism of the story is also great. The names alone are a subject onto themselves: ""Ennis del Mar"", meaning ""island of the sea"", Jack ""Twist"", where a ""twist"" is apparently rodeo lingo for  a well developed ham string muscle. ""Alma"" means ""soul"". The word ""Brokeback"" is open to many an interpretation. My own favourite is the one that underpins the tragedy of the story; that the events that took place on the mounatain between Ennis and Jack metaphorically broke their hearts (and backs) afterwards.This story is amazing. It's a wonder it hasn't been written before, but my praises go to Annie Proulx for having the courage to write it. There will never be another like it."	5.0	Brokeback Mountain: A Straight Guy's Perspective	2006-02-20	63	51	12

Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall gave outstanding performances.  The two played cowboys, Ennis(Ledger) and Jack(Gylenhall), who fell inlove while tending to sheep over the summer.  Living in a time and place where homosexuality was unnaceptable, they each got married and had children.  However, their love for eachother never ended and they would go on ""fishing trips"" a couple times a year to be with eachother.  This was a good love story and you really feel for the characters.  Aside from a couple overly dramatized scenes, this movie really didn't have any major flaws.  The acting, writing, and cinematography were all perfect.  I was surpsied by Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams' acting ablities, they were great!  This movie pretty much did everything right and lives up to the hype."	4.0	Well done!	2006-02-14	19	10	9

Something about this movie though seemed to fall flat. The acting was wooden and the emotions seemed fake. It wasn't really a great love story and seemed to lack real passion. After the first time, all of their meetings seemed painful, unsatisfying and not worth the effort. The overall tone of the movie was moody and I found the ending a little anti-climactic. I really respect the fact that writers and studios are getting brave enough to branch out and make movies about taboo subjects like this. It was a good effort but not a great movie. It wasn't terrible, it just left me feeling empty. It's kind of a depressing storyline with not a lot of happy moments, just a lot of pain, drama and problems. There seemed to be little chemistry between the two actors. Let me just say, I have no problem with people being gay and I would have felt the same way if this was a heterosexual story! There just were no sparks, and the movie came off as cold or lukewarm at best.	3.0	Not all it's made out to be	2006-12-14	20	5	15

1417030321	Brokeback Mountain	AE9GUE3HHOX3U	zooni	"I had a feeling I wasn't going to like this movie.  I loved the cinematography and I thought Heath Ledger's performance was the most genuine, believable and less restrained out of the two.  Jake Gyeggenhal's performance seemed rehearsed and not from the heart.  It was the first time I noticed Heath Ledger was a very soulful person, I could tell by his performance.  The problem I had with the movie is the characters.  They both led double lives and were I'm assuming, ""bisexual"".  I live the gay lifestyle and let me tell you there is nothing worse than a man trying to come off as straight when he is totally gay, especially ""cowboys""!  They knew what they really wanted, yet they deceived woman in the process and had kids no less.  I'm sorry but in my book, that's called BEING PHONY, and is also counter-productive for the gay community.  I don't care where they lived or what time this story took place in (the early 60's).  They could have moved to New York or West Hollywood, they had resources back then.  Don't tell me they didn't know anything about it, that's why the Jack character went all the way down to Mexico to get it.  He knew where to get it.  It's these type of people who ruin it for REAL homosexuals. they give us a bad name and they confuse everybody in the process.  It would have been better if Jack was the true homosexual instead of making them both bisexual.  I liked the story of ""Boy's Don't Cry"" better.  At least Hillary Swank's character knew what she wanted and went to no lenths to become a boy to avoid all this confusion and blurred lines of sexuality.  In my own oppinion, it's these white cowboys who need to stop playing games and represent.  Confused individuals are ironically back in the closet again and it's time for another generation to learn AGAIN how to love themselves and live their authentic lives.  It can be no other way.  The consequences of deceiving people about your lifestyle have great reprocussions later on in life as this movie demonstrates. Gay people need to be proud of who they are."	3.0	True Lies	2008-09-18	18	3	15
