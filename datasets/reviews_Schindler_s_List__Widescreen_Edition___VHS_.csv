0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2RSR8C10AERD	"10za ""10za"""	"I disagree with the majority of viewers.  This is no masterpiece.  It is a pretty good movie with a story that is moving.Spielberg never uses subtlety.  He hits you over the head with each point and I find it insulting to a viewer's intelligence.  Shots linger too long... characters explain their actions..If you can get over Spielberg's in your face style this is a great and sometimes moving story.  The acting is above average but nowhere near approaches the performances in &quot;Sophie's Choice"", &quot;Europa, Europa&quot; or even the made for TV mini series &quot;Holocaust&quot;This movie is worth seeing but given the choice I would first view the others I have mentioned."	3.0	Very overrated... as sophisticated as a made-for-TV movie	2004-03-27	32	12	20

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3EN6NDS6S7N9N	Aaron Jordan	After hearing all the hype about this so-called masterpiece, I went ahead and watched it when it came out on PBS.  What a disappointment.  PBS showed terrible judgment by putting this film on television.Sure the story is interesting, but the way in which this movie portrayed the holocaust fell short of that dignity which such a story deserves.  That dignity was captured much better by Corry Ten Boom's &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; or Viktor Frankl's &quot;Man's Search For Meaning.&quot;  Schindler's List tried to reach for that dignity, but got mired a little too much in the shock factor.  And what a travesty to use the sacrosanct experience of holocaust victims as an excuse to throw more gratuitous sex onto the screen.  Even the nonsexual nudity was unnecessary, as was the bad language and even some of the graphic violence.  Sure the story should be honest and accurate, but overemphasizing the shock factor distracts the viewer from the real human element of the story.  Spielberg took the holocaust and turned it into yet another manifestation of bread and circuses.This film was also too condescending in its moralistic approach.  A good story doesn't have to overtly tell its audience what to think, and the ending just fell flat.  I know Spielberg and the actors were trying to make it moving, but it ended up being....well, kind of sappy and cheesy.This film had potential, but it failed to reach it, and it has been far too overrated.  It definitely does not do justice to those who endured the holocaust.  What a disappointment.	3.0	A Big Disappointment	2001-08-07	50	11	39
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3NM43CKQO1KRU	Abe Greenberg	After making a fortune on silly but entertaining blockbusters like Jaws and the Indiana Jones movies, Spielberg decided to take himself seriously as a Jewish filmmaker and do a holocaust movie.  The predictable reflex is  to say the movie is great, because it is about the holocaust.  But I find  the BUSINESS of recreating the holocaust for Hollywood a disturbing and  potentially dangerous endeavor.  A re-enactment can remove the audience  from the reality of the event, so authenticity is critical.  This movie,  which was purported by many to be realistic, was filled with flaws.  It was  in B&amp;W, which was a big problem for me.  There seems to be an ongoing  debate about this issue with some of the other reviewers, but my feeling is  that the holocaust happened in color, so the movie should have been in  color to bring it closer to home.  I sensed the B&amp;W was an unnecessary  and unsuccessful attempt at an artistic touch.  The movie also should have  been done in German with English subtitles.  Imagine a German watching  Schindler's List in Germany, reading subtitles to understand the English  dialogue.  Does that sound realistic to you?  If you want to learn about  the holocaust, watch Shoah or read a book by Primo Levi.  Don't watch the  Hollywood version by billionaire profiteer SS.	1.0	The Hollywood version of the Jewish Holocaust	1999-12-05	87	28	59

The Holocaust is portrayed magnificently by Spielberg, who directed Jaws, of how over 6 million Jews were killed in shootings,  ghettos, and concentration camps. Absolutely moving, with terrific  performances.Spielberg delivers digression of our anticipation, shocking us  with the deaths of the innocent Jews( particulary the death of the grateful  man with one arm).

I would recommend this movie to anybody who is really into World War II, the Holocaust, and/or the actors that were in it, who did an outstanding and amazing job of portraying these real characters. I haven't seen that many World War II movies, except for Saving Private Ryan, which is another masterpiece from the awesome Steven Spielberg, but this movie is the type of movie that you will actually have an understanding of how much of an impact it is for the Jewish community and for the Jews that survived this horrible time in our past. I think this is the best movie that was done by Spielberg, and I would recommend it to anyone, expect for children.	5.0	Absolutely magnificent, without a doubt	2004-03-12	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3W3O2IA3L0WFB	"A. Hallaj ""309"""	The movie is mainly in black and white, directed with high professionalism and refers to the most serious matter Spielberg ever approached: the Holocaust.Moreover, the Holocaust has been approached from many aspects, mostly with stereotyped ideas (either it did happen or never happened), exaggerated or not, included Gypsies or not ...etc., some authors and historians actually deformed this horrible historical facts, others tried to profit out of it and few told it as it happened.The movie is -most probably- about a real story that it did happen, nothing is unusual in the brutality of war, sadistic soldiers and generals, poor hopeless people killed for their race, color or religion: All where repeated -and still- in every war. Nothing is unusual, also, in Oskar Schindler, this no-saint war profiter who finally turned to be a savior, which is something common in the human race, and which creates the real heroes enlightening the human accumulation of wisdom.Spielberg did a great job, very realistic and brought to cinema the unique movie about the real holocaust that included the corruption of the generals, the madness of the Nazi ideology and the horrible tragedy that Jews (and other 160 million victims) died in it. However, it is not an anti-German film or Holocaust propaganda, it is a precious credit to the cinema and Spielberg (together with his other great masterpiece Empire Of The Sun) reminding us that it is a great art.Do not watch the movie for the Holocaust controversy, and do not watch it because it is for Spielberg, but buy it and view it every time someone is promoting WAR.	4.0	A hero, a tragedy and the wisdom out of it	2004-03-06	4	1	3

In 2004, the fact that we have to turn this DVD over is moronic, and Spielberg knows better.  The extras are mediocre.  Just think what he could have done, with a documentary on the Holocaust.  Why it took so long to get this DVD in print is beyond me.  And the container is cardboard, and gives no listing of the chapters.  The so-called container that holds the inserts is open at the bottom so the inserts fall out.The DVD concept is one of the marvels of technology in the last decade.  And Spielberg, who prides himself with being technologically advanced, gives us a DVD that could have been made in the early 1990s.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1LBMDHBZJGJ44	Alberto Diaz	This movie is amazing, I had never seen such a brilliant movie, the cinematography is awesome, and the story is beautiful, is not that sad movie where a hero comes at the end at saves the day, no, it is great, the story of Oscar Schindler and how Spielberg caught the holocaust on film is brilliant, why did he waste his time with Jurassic Park, Schindler's List is his best, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are his best, both are different yet equal in one thing, they are both wonderful, not the theme their are based, but how that theme was put on film, amazing, I thought Spielberg was just a blockbuster film director who didn't really did smart movies, or endearing films, and since his credits were Jaws, E.T, Jurassic Park, Poltergeist, and so on, sure some were good, but not really mind-blowing as Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, in all his movies he showed he had more to offer but was not permitted to, or had not received the film project correct for him, maybe Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Empire of the Sun were the closest ones, but when he did Schindler's List, I was surprised. And the movie, well, is brilliant, I can't describe it, just watch it and you'll see. The only problem is that is not on DVD, why, this film deserves to be on DVD, it is awesome, just imagine the movie in one disc, digitally remastered, in widescreen, what a thrill that would be, not to enjoy the killing but the message behind it, the hope, the fight of the Jewish people to survive, how great that would be. Plus, I would include some great special features, trailers, talent files, photo albums, a great box for the discs, documentaries of the holocaust, of Schindler, of the Jewish people, featurettes of how the film was made, commentaries by Spielberg, John Williams and Itzhak Perlman, the music masters the scored this movie wonderfully, by the way the score is beautiful, just hear the sample of the theme by Itzhak Perlman and you'll see. But back to the DVD, you know, Spielberg should come out with a great Collectors Special Ultimate Edition for Schindler's List, people want it, and although this film was not has successful in the box-office like all his other popcorn movies, it sure beats each and every one of them, plus, it won plenty of Oscars, with good reason, thank God the Academy did not ignore Schindler's List as they did with Saving Private Ryan by not giving it best picture, but that is another thing, the point is that Schindler's List should be on DVD, and with a great edition, not like the ones Paramount does, no, and since The Empire of the Sun has been just released, why stop there, do the same for Schindler's List, I'm sure many people will want to buy this great masterpiece, I am not Jewish, but this film touched me, along with the soundtrack, which is also a must have, so please, if you have seen it and loved it like I did, subscribe your e-mail to be informed when will it come out, since by doing this, Amazon will inform the producers how many people are waiting the film to come out on DVD, I'll sure wait, but I hope not for long. I give it 4 Stars because is not on DVD, the movie deserves more than 5 stars.	4.0	A BRILLIANT MASTERPIECE, SPIELBERG&#65533;S BEST,WHY NO DVD YET	2001-12-29	5	4	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1A87TUBBDPMF0	"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer"""	"Even though Steven Spielberg had made some of the most successful -- and profitable -- films in movie history (E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, Jaws, the Indiana Jones series), he was always perceived as a master craftsman but never as a ""serious"" director capable of making a grown-up film.  This is an odd perception, considering that in addition to such crowd-pleasers as Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T. (along with the plethora of projects he has been involved with as executive producer -- Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and the Back to the Future trilogy), Spielberg had directed such serious fare as 1985's The Color Purple and 1987's Empire of the Sun, which deal with such weighty topics as race and the effect of war on children.One film, released in late 1993 -- the same year that Jurassic Park set worldwide box office records -- changed that perception forever: Schindler's List.Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German philanderer, member of the Nazi Party, and war profiteer whose desire to make money from Hitler's European war slowly but irrevocably morphed into a desire to save over a thousand of his Jewish labor force from the Nazis' genocidal ""Final Solution,""  Schindler's List is a powerfully moving film.  It not only never flinches from the inhumanity of Hitler's willing executioners -- there are all sorts of terrible things going on in here, including torture, manhunts, mass executions, and random acts of cruelty -- but it also touches on the central belief felt by Spielberg himself that decency and righteousness can triumph over even the most implacable tyranny and hatred.Working from Steven Zaillian's adaptation of the fact-based novel by Thomas Kenneally, Spielberg chose to film Schindler's List in black and white because most of the documentaries, records and photographs he had seen were in black and white.  As a result, whenever he does use color, especially in the key ""Special Aktion"" sequences where Schindler (Star Wars: Episode I's Liam Neeson) catches a glimpse of a single scarlet-clad girl as the Jews of the Krakow Ghetto are ruthlessly rounded up by SS troops.  Spielberg draws the audience's -- and Schindler's -- attention on this single little girl by inserting the coat's red color into the otherwise stark shades of gray, black and white that dominate the film (which is the most expensive black and white movie made, displacing Darryl F. Zanuck's 1962 war classic The Longest Day).Spielberg also chose to shoot Schindler's List on location in Krakow, Poland, where most of the movie takes place, painstakingly recreating the look and atmosphere of the period. A full scale set of Plaszow Labor Camp was built near the site of the real one from existing maps and blueprints, and a few scenes were filmed outside the infamous Auschwitz death camp.Neeson's top notch performance is matched by those of Ralph Fiennes (SS Commandant Amon Goeth), Ben Kingsley (Itzhak Stern), and Caroline Goodall (as Schindler's long-suffering wife Emile), as well as Jonathan Sagalle and Embeth Davidtz.  Fiennes in particular is outstanding as the homicidal and capricious SS commandant of the Plaszow labor camp, who thought nothing of picking up a rifle and using unwitting and unfortunate inmates for morning target practice.Schindler's List won popular and critical acclaim, winning seven Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Music (by long-time collaborator John Williams), Screenplay, Cinematography, Editing, and Art Direction.  It is not only a fine example of filmmaking at its best, but it also serves as a memorial to the six million victims of the Holocaust, as well as a tribute to a flawed but righteous man who gave up his fortune and risked his life to save a handful of his fellow human beings from history's greatest criminal act.The DVD presents Spielberg's 196 minute masterpiece on one double-sided disc in a digitally enhanced widescreen picture and 5.1 digital sound.  The audio and video content are excellent, although fans of extra features may bemoan the lack of ""the making of"" behind-the-scenes featurettes present in other Spielberg-directed movies on DVD.  Instead, there are the dicumentaries ""Voices From the List"" and ""The Shoah Foundation Story.""Nevertheless, the recently-released Universal Studios Home Video DVD is a worthy addition to any serious film lover's collection."	5.0	Spielberg's masterpiece touches hearts and minds.....	2004-03-12	6	4	2

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2KIT6G62L8OR5	Alyson T. Bumgarner	Enter Steven Spielberg, and enter a gut-wrenching, eye-opening, heartbreaking tale of war and genocide on the European Jews. This story from start to finish takes you on an emotional roller coaster. Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party during the time of the Holocaust, finagles a brilliant idea. If Jews were used to run his business, the cost would be significantly less. With the help of his new business accountant, Itzhak Stern, Schindler creates a war time business, that creates more money that he can use in a lifetime.Over time, Oskar begins to battle with the ideologies of the war, and begins to journey through a path of discovery upon himself. He does kind things for the Jews, and even helps to the point of bringing on more workers, so that his workers do not feel the horrible pain of working labor camps.At the end of the movie, Schindler realizes that all of his workers are leaving to ultimately be extinguished from society. Because of the bond he has formed, primarily with Stern, but with others of his workers, he decides to purchase these Jews to prevent them from further harm. He sets up the arrangement for them to be sent to a new camp, in his home town, where they will work. He purchases 1100 Jewish slaves. He runs his company into the ground, but in the seven months it operates, Schindler prevented these slaves from death or punishment, and even allow them to practice their religion.This movie speaks volumes of one man's ability to change the world. Oskar Schindler saved 1100 Jews from execution, a monumental help to the Jewish community. There are now 6,000 Schindler Jews that exist in the world, a feat that would not have happened without this man's hard work and loyalty to the Jewish people.The movie shows of horror and pain that the Jews experienced in Poland, and at labor camps. It is by far one of the hardest movies I've ever tried to watch, but the discovery that there are good people in bad times makes the movie worthwhile to see.	4.0	Schindler's List	2010-03-23	0	0	0

I don't know what it is, but it's a drive to know about it, to understand it. I just recently saw this movie for the first time. I expected it to be like most World War II movies, mostly action and political, but this movie amazed me. It was the most moving movie I've ever seen on the Holocaust and the cruelity of man-kind. Once you see this movie you'll always carry it around in the back of your mind. It was the best three hours and seventeen minutes of my life.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3FZQHXUNLN8BL	A. Martin	This is the second time that I have tried to stream a movie on Amazon. I paid to watch this movie. It took me over 4 hours to watch the movie. Every 20 minutes or so, the movie would stop and it would have to &#34;reconnect.&#34; Except, it never reconnected, and I would have to close it, go back to &#34;my account,&#34; sign in again, and then re-load the movie. Half the time it wouldn't start where it finished, so I had to guess where I left off. You can imagine that watching a movie like Schindler's List in this way, made it much less entertaining and impactful.One of the only reasons I have a Prime membership is for the movies. Since I cannot stream movies effectively any more, I have quit Amazon Prime. You cannot charge me for a service and then not provide it. I can get better streaming from free sites online. Why would I pay Amazon for half-assed service.

There's no art so it just looks like one of those rewritables.  Should have been on two dvds.  Then theres the awful cover which is just made from paper material!  Just after opening the cellophane wrap i got fingerprints all over it.  The cover should have been the traditional plastic.  If the marketers really wanted paper, they should have put the paper over the plastic cover like how Beauty and Beast is done.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AOOCDN5TFZ9QP	"Amazon Customer ""benshlomo"""	"Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)I saw this movie for the first time along with a group of seven other people, in a completely full theater.  When the curtain went down and the lights came on, everyone got up and moved to the door, but no one said a word.  Not one.  It was dead quiet all the way out to the street.  I've never experienced anything like that.I was raised knowing all about the six million we lost in the Holocaust, not to mention the five or six million others who died in the camps, but I didn't really get it until Spielberg silenced me and everyone else in the room.  How did he do it?First of all, he chose the right protagonist.  Oskar Schindler, the savior of a thousand Jews, was anything but an angel - he toadied up to those in power unashamedly, paid bribes with money he didn't have, took advantage of the unfortunate for his own ends, cheated endlessly on his wife, and kept his eye on his bottom line to the exclusion of everything else.  He was flawed, vulnerable and human, like you and me, and through his reaction to what he sees we can feel the indescribable horror as we could not through the reactions of a saint.  There's a scene in this movie where Schindler, out for a horseback ride with one of his girlfriends, happens upon a mountain of corpses being burned.  A saint might look sad or angry at such a scene - Liam Neeson's expression is that of a man falling off a cliff he didn't know was there.  Faced with such carnage, that's probably how I'd look, too.Spielberg's other smart move was filming ""Schindler's List"" in black and white.  Siskel and Ebert have pointed out, rightly, that black and white makes images appear somehow eternal, like historical documents rather than mere pictures.  That's certainly true here, but it works on many levels.  Sometimes the black and white photography has a matte finish and takes on the character of news photography, showing how banal (and therefore how terrifying) an image is, such as those times when Ralph Fiennes Commandant Goeth shoots a few passing prisoners for breakfast.  On the other hand, ""Schindler's List"" contains a great many images that look like they were etched on mirrors, such as the famous shot of a little boy hiding from the Nazis at the bottom of a latrine.  At those moments, even when (as one character says) ""all around lies the gulf,"" the pictures soak up a truly heavenly light, as though Someone were watching.The performers involved certainly behave as though Someone were watching, and they turn in the work of their lives, from the stars to the bit players.  Neeson has just the right sort of big, craggy face that can show decadence one minute and agony the next, and he's got the talent to run the whole gamut in all the right places.  Fiennes, in his first major role, resembles nothing so much as a sort of human hog, but a cunning and crazed one - he seems able to sweat on cue.  Ben Kingsley as Schindler's factory manager, with almost no change in his facial expression, makes us see how he moves from suspicion to hope to love for this strange animal, his boss.  And besides these monumental performances, there's the black marketeer who finagles his customers with one breath and loves his wife with the next; the engineer who sacrifices her life to the fact that concrete needs to be poured with care; the old hinge-maker who waits on his knees for a miracle involving a jammed gun; the pretty young woman who informs Schindler that he's running a haven rather than a factory; the kindly but finally gutless industrialist, and a many dozen others, all unforgettable.And then there's Spielberg's damping down his usual sentimentality, his choice of Yiddish music for the soundtrack, his placement of the camera at a quiet and unobtrusive angle for the worst of evils - I found all of this pretty nearly perfect, but there were those who complained about the movie's historical inaccuracy.  In one scene, much noted for its supposed softening of the facts, Schindler's female ""employees"" find themselves in a big room with shower heads in the ceiling and actually get a shower instead of a flood of poison gas.  It's true that most prisoners were not so fortunate, and that such scenes may play into the hands of the filth who claim that there was no cyanide in the camps, but I can't see that as an argument against this movie.  If nothing else, the looks of tension on the women's faces before the water comes down is more than enough to tell us what they expect to get.After all, Spielberg is not a documentarian, he's a storyteller; this story could not have had a better servant.  The meaning of the Holocaust is as plain as plain here, particularly at the end when Schindler realizes that he could have saved a few more human beings if he had just thought to sell his car or his gold Nazi pin.  He crumples weeping to his knees, only to be lifted up by the men and women he has saved.A little later we learn that the descendants of Schindler's Jews living in Israel outnumber the entire current Jewish population of Poland.  That silences all criticism, as the movie audience already knew.  Hence the quiet after the final credits.Benshlomo says nothing."	5.0	The Rest Is Silence	2003-07-15	24	22	2

Steven Spielberg brought this dark episode in human history to the screen.  Many of the scenes and occurances are truly appalling.  But the story needed to be told, and Liam Neeson's performance is incredible.  The tranformation from greedy industrialist, to protector of his workers is very moving .  One can only shudder at the germans plans for extermination in Europe.  And they claimed to be a civilized race.  We can hope that this vast atrocity will never happen again.

This is really a slap in the face to the 6 million Jews who were slaughtered, their suviving families, and the 5 million other gypsies, Catholics, unionists, and others Hitler had killed in concentration camps. Spileberg made the movie this way because he knew it would be guaranteed commercial and critical success as it would be more palatable to the average person than a movie showing the real horrors of the Holocaust. He portrays the nazis as mostly men who act out of corruption, and meanness, but ignores the true fact that these men were evil. Liberals like Spielberg have a very difficult time acknowledging the fact that evil exists. They attribute the actions of evil people to feelings of necessity on their parts, or just to sheer lunacy. The Holocaust was an evil action perpetrated by evil men. It wasn't just thrown together. It was well thought out in terms of logistics, transportation, and means of killing and disposing of bodies. A classic Spielberg moment was when Schindler beseeches the Nazi guards to not kill the plant workers when the war has ended. ""Return to your families as men, not murderers."" The fact is the Nazis did their best to liqudate the Jews when they knew they had lost the war and even up to the very end. The simple reason that more Jews weren't killed at the end is that the Nazis had ran out of ammunition to kill people en masse. This isn't meant to denigrate people like Schindler who really did good. The fact is though that most Germans were indifferent at best and helped the process along at worst. By highlighting Schindlers story Spielberg told the easy story and still came out smelling like roses. Meanwhile almost 12 million victims are ignored."	1.0	A travesty	2005-06-18	72	18	54
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2ZZMJGF0J9YM9	Amazon Customer	&#8220;Schindlers&#8221; List is created by Steven Spielberg and was a award winning film. This movie illustrates the profoundly nightmarish Holocaust. It recreates a dark, fighting period during World War II when Nazi-occupied Krakow. It dispossessed Jews of their homes and businesses and placed in the ghettos and forced labor camps in Plaszow. Then finally settled down in the concentration camps for execution. A German businessman, opportunist, and member of the Nazi party names Oskar Schindler acquires a factory. He believes that he can have production of mess kits and cooking paraphernalia in his new factory. He didn&#8217;t know much about how to properly run a enterprise like this so he gains contact with a man named Itzhak Stern. Itzhak Stern has links with the underground Jewish business community in the ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products produced for trade in the black market. Schindler witnesses the horrifying visions of the Holocaust and the toll it takes on the Jewish people. Schindler&#8217;s motivations switch from profit to human sympathy and by lavishly bribing the SS officials, he is able to save over 1,100 Jews from death in the gas chambers.Looking at the World Religion for &#8220;Schindlers List&#8221; focuses on Judaism. Two parts stick out to me the most about the religious side of the movie. One being the Shabbat candles which are at the start of the movie (celebrating the Shabbat) and fade out to the movie and also at the end of the movie which again they celebrate the Shabbat. The movie really shows how the commandments of God come into play. Schindler could have just allowed his works to be taken and not think twice of it. He had a heart unlike others did and cared for his workers and fought hard to get them back. The other main world religion part that sticks out is the reference to the Star of David. This is a symbol of Jewish identity that every Jewish person had to wear on them at all times. Also the ring that Schindler was given at the end of the movie has writings from the Talmud, which are works of commentary on the laws of the Torah and teachings of the Hebrew bible. The final scene of where all the Jews are singing in Hebrew and walking to get to a safe land compares to Moses and his people looking for their promise land.	5.0	A must see	2014-04-06	2	2	0

However, this is still an important movie, especially for my generation, which has not known any large-scale war. Such excellent works as this remind us of the horrors that can grow from hate, and encourage us not to repeat them.Why is it so abominable that Mr. Spielberg make a film on the holocaust? Is he unqualified simply because he is Jewish? The film is not propaganda, nor exploitative, as the events that are depicted are very thoroughly grounded in reality. They are not sensationalized in typical Hollywood fashion. If Spielberg were only after another blockbuster hit, he would have made the movie much differently (e.g. shorter, more entertaining, with a more likeable protaganist). In fact, this movie is his way of remembering and honoring the victims and heroes of this dark period, through as honest a portrayal as is fit for the big screen.I do not understand the accusations of racism against Germans in this movie. After all, Schindler himself was German, even considered highly by the Nazis in power, before his disapproval of their philosophies developed. In reality, the movie is not racist. Rather, it lays bare the evils which arise from elitism and racism, in this case demonstrated by the Nazis. An intelligent viewer will take this lesson and expand it to apply to all such evil in the world.	5.0	A tragedy that needs to be remembered	2002-03-14	2	2	0

The realism can be disturbing at times but the performances are first rate.  If you want to see compassion in action, watch this story of Oskar Schindler's WWII effort to save as many Polish Jews as he could.  Amazing!  It's no wonder this film won so many awards.From the ""amc filmsite"" review by Tim Dirks [&#8230;]:""Schindler's List (1993) is Steven Spielberg's unexpected award-winning masterpiece - a profoundly shocking, unsparing, fact-based, three-hour long epic of the nightmarish Holocaust. [Italian-American catholic Martin Scorsese was originally slated to direct the film, but turned down the chance - claiming the film needed a director of Jewish descent - before turning it over to Spielberg.] Its documentary authenticity vividly re-creates a dark, frightening period during World War II, when Jews in Nazi-occupied Krakow were first dispossessed of their businesses and homes, then placed in ghettos and forced labor camps in Plaszow, and finally resettled in concentration camps for execution. The violence and brutality of their treatment in a series of matter-of-fact (and horrific) incidents is indelibly and brilliantly orchestrated.""Except for the bookends (its opening and closing scenes) and two other brief shots (the little girl in a red coat and candles burning with orange flames), the entire film in-between is shot in crisp black and white. The film is marvelous for the way in which it crafts its story without contrived, manipulative Hollywood-ish flourishes (often typical of other Spielberg films) - it is also skillfully rendered with overlapping dialogue, parallel editing, sharp and bold characterizations, contrasting compositions of the two main characters (Schindler and Goeth), cinematographic beauty detailing shadows and light with film-noirish tones, jerky hand-held cameras (cinema verite), a beautifully selected and composed musical score (including Itzhak Perlman's violin), and gripping performances.""The screenplay by Steven Zaillian was adapted from Thomas Keneally's 1982 biographic novel (Schindler's Ark), constructed by interviews with 50 Schindler survivors found in many nations, and other wartime associates of the title character, as well as other written testimonies and sources. Oskar Schindler was an enterprising, womanizing Nazi Sudeten-German industrialist/opportunist and war profiteer, who first exploited the cheap labor of Jewish/Polish workers in a successful enamelware factory (Deutsche Emailwaren Fabrik or D.E.F.), and eventually rescued more than one thousand of them from certain extinction in labor/death camps.""Before the film was made, Spielberg had offered Holocaust survivor and director Roman Polanski the job of making the film, but Polanski declined. Since then, ten years later, Polanski made his own honored Holocaust film, the Best Director-winning The Pianist (2002). Stanley Kubrick abandoned his own plans to make a similar film in the planning stages, called ""The Aryan Papers"" - based on the Louis Begley novel Wartime Lies.""The unanimously-praised film with a modest budget of $23 million deservedly won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (the first for Spielberg), Best Cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score (John Williams), Best Editing (Michael Kahn), and Best Art Direction. It also won nominations for two of its male leads: Best Actor (Liam Neeson) and Best Supporting Actor (Ralph Fiennes), Best Costume Design, Best Sound, and Best Makeup. Other organizations including the British Academy Awards, the New York Film Critics Circle, and the Golden Globes, likewise honored the film. It was the first black/white film since The Apartment (1960) to win the Best Picture Academy Award, and the most commercially-successful B/W film in cinematic history."""	5.0	18 years later, still a winner!	2011-03-04	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A6QYEXZX865GL	A Movie Reviewer	Schindler's List was a terribly difficult movie to watch because it was one of the most true to life movie's of the Holocaust I have seen. The movie is a gripping tale of the transformation of one man, Oskar Schindler, who turned into someone who saved the lives of almost 1100 Jewish men and woman from the horror of the concentration camps. Because of this man, there are more than 6000 descendants alive today. He began as a man who was concentrating on making a fortune from the slave labor of thousands of Jews. As he began to form a relationship with his business manager and other Jews working in his factory he began to realize the horror of what was really going on. He formed many relationships with the Nazi's which allowed him to bribe them into getting preferential treatment of his business manager and eventually the release of all of his employees. Meanwhile, the movie depicted the horrible tale of what the Jewish men and women went through during the Holocaust. The movie truly made you feel the pain, horror and anguish of the Jews as they tried to live and adapt to what was happening to them. I thought the best part of this entire movie was the very end in which you learned that the Jews 'working' in Schindler's ammunition factory did not make one thing that could be used or even worked. He also kept the guards out of the factory so that word would not get back to their supervisor's that Schindler was in fact protecting those who worked for him.This movie definitely makes me wonder how the Jews held onto their faith when it was the very reason they were killed and treated like animals. It's a wonder that those who survived still held strong to their faith and continue to today. The Holocaust will undoubtedly be something that will forever affect the Jewish community.	3.0	Schindler's List Movie Review	2010-04-17	3	1	2
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AWYZSV4TF0A57	Amy	"Schinlder's List is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Set in war-torn Poland, this movie is a dark story about an unlikely hero.  Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) began a business, employing Jews who were headed for certain death in the concentration camps during World War II.  Schindler belongs to the Nazi party and starts off thinking of only the money he can make using Jewish people to make pots and pans for the German military.  By the end of the war, Schindler, the the help of his Jewish accountant (Ben Kingsley), he saves 1100 Jews from death in concentration camps.  He spent every dime he made to employ Jews at a munitions factory, which was a cover for the safe-haven he was truly offering.To me, the part of the movie that really drove the message home was the little girl in the red coat.  So many times, when movies about the Holocaust are presented, all we as the audience see are masses of faceless, nameless people.  One little girl in red coat, which was the only color in the entire film, struck out at me, challenging ""Do you see me? I am an individual.""  This one little scared girl, running to hide, put all the horror and tragedy into perspective.This movie gives us a brief, powerful glimpse of the struggles of European Jews during World War II and the heroism of one man that risked his life to save so many others."	5.0	Schindler's List	2010-11-20	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A36IYF4FWA8MD8	an amazon fan	Please be intelligent enough if you are going to watch this film. I had seen so many idiotic letters for this review and so many complaints about the flip DVD and its packaging. These people seemed not to talk whatever about one of the true purposes of this movie. That is, some people can have their conscience developed so that they can make a positive mark in this world. And if enough people became like this, willing to risk everything to join the fight against evil, this world would be in better shape. I'm sure that all the people who were so downright negative did not know that Speilberg used so much of his time and money after the movie was made to create and develop an enormous project to make sure that the memoriesof the Holocaust will be kept alive in part by taping as many Holocaust survivors all around the world about their stories during the time when this world was turned upside down. He knew a permanent record will be needed since there are less and less Holocaust survivors as each day passes. For the people who say that since the Holocaust happened 6 decades ago, and thus there is no reason to remember this singular madness (1933-1945), all that I could say is that by ignoring the past and therefore not learning about it, it can happen again. That is, state sponsored satanic ritual abuse to Jews and others regardless if they were infants, children, or adults of any age. And the ways they were all murdered should haunt decent people forever.	5.0	Never forget and never compare!	2004-10-02	3	2	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1A3OWVOO1ZEEZ	anboulware	Schindler's list is a great movie for anyone that is interested in a look at the struggles the Jewish people endured during the Holocaust. The movie begins in 1939, in Poland at the beginning of WWII. Liam Neeson plays the character of Oskar Schindler. Schindler is a powerful German business man who sees an opportunity to capitalize on the current situation. He then teams up with Ben Kingsley's character, Itzak Stern, to start a factory employing Jewish workers. Itzak Stern is head of the Judenrat Council, and is able to provide assistance to the Jewish people in getting employment to avoid being shipped away to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Steven Speilberg does a great job as a director of this movie. Speilberg gives a great view of the struggle the Jewish people went through as families were killed, split apart from each other, and then forced to abandon their beliefs for the sake of survival. The film being in black and white is wonderful way to bring the viewer to somber mood of the camps and the time frame. Ralph Fiennes plays Amon Goeth, who is the Nazi commandant for the Krakaw camp. Fiennes does wonders in his ruthless portrayal of a leader in the Nazi party. This movie gives you time to really form your own opinions on the subject. Schindler's realization of the hurt around him begins to show in his business practices, leaving many of the Jewish people seeking refuge in working in his factory. After watching this movie about the Holocaust, I can understand the importance of remembering these events so history does not repeat itself again. The Holocaust has had great influence in the way modern Jewish and non-Jewish people think. Many can agree that the Holocaust was a terrible tragedy. It has also influenced many modern Jewish peoples tolerance of other Jewish groups.	4.0	Schindler's List	2013-03-24	3	2	1

Though the horrors of the Holocaust are not something that is taken lightly I can still say that this is one of my favorite movies of all times. The story that this movie tells is not only sad, but very powerful and gives a great account of what people had to go through during the Holocaust. I believe that this movie should be viewed by all high school students in history classes so they can get a semi-real feeling of what people went through during this awful reign of Hitler. I'm glad a DVD version finally came out.	5.0	Schindler's List	2004-04-24	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	Obviously that title refers to my review and not the film.Much like `Titanic' (which I still have yet to attempt to review), `Schindler's List' has been talked about so much that saying anything more almost seems pointless.  I mean, really, why review a film that has been reviewed so often and so meticulously that practically everything you or I could say about the film has been said ten times over?I'll tell you why; because I want to.This film has been hailed as not only one of the best films of all time, but the best film about the Holocaust to ever be filmed.  It won many awards including the Academy's top honor and it continues to rank pretty high on many `Top 100' lists as well (currently it's ranking at number 8 on AFI's `100 Years, 100 Movies' list).  Technically speaking they have themselves a winner here.  I cannot fault it for much at all since everything is very, very `correct'.  What I mean by that is that there is barely a flaw to be seen in just about every aspect of the film.  The building blocks are all in the correct places.  The set pieces and costumes are authentic, the acting is without flaw, the mood and storytelling aspect of the film is precise and commendable, the music lifts when it should and scales off when necessary, the black and white imagery is appropriate and captivating.Everything is just as it should be.I think that is my main issue with the film.  Honestly, this may be the only five stars, `A' rated film that I have a major issue with, and issue that could derail any other films shot at a perfect rating.`Schindler's List' is almost too perfect.I'll tell you what I mean here, and hopefully this makes as much sense to you as it does to me.  When reflecting on this film versus the countless other Holocaust movies I've seen recently I noticed something that struck me a little.  `Schindler's List' is so `correct' in it's delivery that it loses a bit of the emotional connection one needs to feel with these types of films.  Before you start bombarding me with comments about how this movie made you cry and this movie perfectly portrays inhumanity and humanity or whatever, take a minute to read all that I have to say about this.  I'm not saying that one doesn't feel the emotions they should.  I cried and I got frustrated and I got angry and in the end I even got those tear-filled feelings of happiness, but there was no real `connection' involved.  It was mechanical emotions that any and every living breathing `decent' person should and will feel when watching this sort of atrocity.  The best way I can say this is by likening it to the feelings one might get from watching a documentary on the same subject.  `Schindler's List' even carries that same feeling to it; that documentation feel.  That's part of what I mean by being `correct'.  Everything is `just so', `point blank', `nonchalant', as if it's being dictated to us.It's almost as if this fault can't really be faulted it since the coldness is so impeccably translated to the lack of emotional connection that it comes off as one of Spielberg's artistic tactics.This same `correctness' can be directed at the acting, which is impeccable in a very mannerly way.  Each performance is just as it should be.  I can't say a negative thing about them technically.  Liam Neeson has never been this proficient and this authentic.  Ben Kingsley is solid and believable.  As great as they were though, they were `correct to a fault' almost.  The lack of charismatic bravado or even the minutest of flaws almost makes them (don't cringe at this) forgettable.  That's not to take away from what they've done here (Neeson is very effective when he needs to be), but at the end of the day there is nothing about these performances that really grabs me and demands me take notice.  On the other hand, Ralph Fiennes understood how to deliver a technically `correct' performance without losing the spark that makes him infectious and captivating.  Sure, his character screams `look at me' but he is the one that demands us look at him.  It's not just about theatrics (and this is directed at you trigger happy readers who are about to comment that I don't understand subtlety without reading a single other review I've written) for his best scene is one where he says absolutely nothing and quite honestly moves not a single body part.  There is a moment when he is alone in his bathroom, his head tilted to the side, and the glare in his eyes is monstrous.Best scene in the film and, without hesitation, one of the best supporting performances of the 90's and possibly even forever.When considering this film alongside films like `Sophie's Choice' or `The Reader' or maybe more appropriately `The Pianist' I have come to realize that the direction this film takes is far different in style and effectiveness.  One could argue that this is, without doubt, the better film, and technically speaking you are probably correct.  With that said though, I feel a deeper connection to `The Reader' or `The Pianist' because they took the time to really make their characters a part of the audience.Like I said, this film is still a five stars, `A' grade film for me.  It ranks among the best films of 93 (a deserving win, even if I don't feel it deserved to win, beings that `The Piano' and `The Remains of the Day' were both better films) and certainly one of the most commanding and memorable films (and widely talked about) that most of the world will see.  Maybe that is why this film has remained so widely loved.  There are so many amazing films that get no fan base and thus fizzle into obscurity.  An accessible film like `Schindler's List' will never die out as long as it is at our fingertips.I know that this seems like I'm being harsh, which is probably confusing to many beings that I handed this a five star rating, but I cannot deny the fact that this is an amazing film that is technically flawless.  On the other hand, I cannot lie about how I feel.It just goes to prove that even a brilliant film that one loves and adores has its limitations when one is willing to be open and honest.	5.0	A different approach to reviewing a `masterpiece'...	2009-06-22	4	1	3
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2L8Z5TWKOPKGP	AndrewKirkman	The movie Schindler's List is mainly about a man named Oskar Schindler. He comes to town to try to become rich making army supplies for the German armies. Using bribes he eventually gains access to a factory and a lot of other things in order to run it. Schindler hires Jews to work in his factory and documents are falsified so as many Jews as possible are saved from being sent to the death camp. After a new camp is finished however an order goes out to eliminate the remaining Jews in the area and after witnessing a horrible massacre Schindler dedicates the majority of his wealth to trying to protect the Jewish people who work at his factories. He intends to get them out of the country but there is a mix up that ends up with him having to bribe people at Auschwitz to get some of the people that were on his list that were sent there mistakenly. He ends up saving them as well as rescuing some of the children that were at the camp as well. He manages to keep people alive by continually bribing officials and eventually runs through his entire fortune. After the war Schindler has to leave because he was being hunted by the Russian army for war crimes he was not guilty of. The end of the film shows the Jewish people who worked at Schindler's factory placing stones on his grave as a sign of great respect for what he did for them.This movie displays many important concepts in many different religions. The main one that I can think of is the major theme of helping your fellow man that resonates in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Muslims are supposed to donate money to charities as one of their pillars of faith and Schindler gave up his entire fortune to try and keep the factory workers safe. He also respected the faith of the people that worked there and went out of his way to save as many people as he could.	5.0	REL110FON02 Andrew Kirkman	2011-11-20	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	APCH52FMMSTXK	Andrew Miller	It's hard to imagine the same guy releasing two films in the same year with such varied tastes and quality.  Jurassic Park was a summer blockbuster in 1993, then in the fall this one hit and proved yet again what a master filmmaker little Stevie is.What isn't nearly perfect in this film?  Nearly perfect, because a completely perfect film has yet to be made.Schindler's List is one of those life-altering film experiences (JFK and Lawrence of Arabia are two others, personally) that fuel your mind and compell you to read more about history.Though not entirely accurate -- Oskar and his wife didn't have that tearful goodbye to Stern (they fled in the wee hours of the morning), this is excuseable for it's awe-inspiring visuals and teary music by John Williams.  The final shot (won't give it away, for those who haven't seen it) is incredibly powerful and moving.This film also introduced audiences to Ralph Fiennes, playing the fiery Amon Goeth.  Unfortunately, though, his career took a dive pretty quickly (though he was good in Quiz Show, Strange Days, and Baby of Macan).This is one of those films that will stick with you forever, make you think, and inspire you beyond belief.	5.0	Spielberg's Best!	2004-02-24	6	3	3

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1FKSXV8DXSGAF	Andrew Taylor	There are many movies out there that you can watch over and over and be entertained. You can pop it in, make some popcorn, and generally be entertained. No matter how many times you see it, it doesn't get old.Schindler's List is not that kind of movie. In the same vein of Twelve Years a Slave, you won't be eager to watch this movie again. In fact, I cannot blame you if you don't want to. I will likely never watch this movie again, save to remind myself and others of just what humanity is capable of doing to itself.However, that does not detract from this movie; quite the opposite. This is a graphic, brutal, and completely horrifying tale from the Holocaust, in which millions of innocent human beings were murdered for possessing a different religious view than the majority of Europe, and were reviled and persecuted because of it. The only smile you will have on your face will be one of relief at the end, with tears flowing from your eyes, as you see a man originally doing this for profit redeem himself by saving everyone he could, then BERATING himself for not saving more when he truly could not.You should not watch this movie; nay, you MUST watch it. This is a film in which you will regret never seeing if you do not, because you will have deprived yourself a true understanding of the horror that was visited upon these people, and how the efforts of one man, arguably the least likely person of them all, managed to save them.	5.0	You only need to watch it once.	2014-06-12	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1FC716939OW6Y	Anduril7star	I remember playing a violin piece from Schindler's List in high school, which was about ten years ago. I had never watched the film until a few weeks ago, and it was amazing-I felt the music was so beautiful, especially for the story that was being depicted in the film. Oskar Schindler is a man who was wealthy as we see he has nice material possessions and a nice place to live. He obtains a factory and hires Jewish workers. His businessman Stern, hires Jews because it saves them from being sent to the death camps. Schindler does not immediately know his intentions, but soon figures out the reason for bringing more Jews in. Jews are still being sent to camps and thousands were dying. At first Schindler was not interested, or unaware that those who worked in his factory were not being sent to camps. This reflects that in real life holocaust casualties, the problems at first were being ignored, or that many people were simply unaware of what was going on and what kind of orders were in effect for the removal of the Jews. We see that Schindler worries less of his material possessions and focuses just on saving as many of the Jews as possible. By staying and working in the factory these Jews were thought as importance to the factory. Near the end of the war Schindler knows that he will be tracked down for a war crime and him and his wife have to leave the country.At the time when we were at war with Germany many Jews were sent to death camps, Auschwitz being a very known one. Because of the way Christianity had evolved in the 30's and 40's with some of its strict ideas, many question how so much hatred came out of it. Jewish faith was viewed as &#8220;not Christian&#8221; and so Jews and what they stood for, people sought to extinguish. The holocaust, with millions of Jews being sent to their death, asks the question of what did Christianity really stand for? Judaism was faced with understanding how God, who loves every human he creates, could allow for such an extermination of the Jewish people. According to the textbook Invitation to World Religions, philosopher Eliezer Berkovits suggests that for human beings to be capable of choice, he argues, God must &#8220;restrain&#8221; Himself and allow His human agents to exercise their moral will, even if the consequences of divine restraint are catastrophic (363). A part of being a Christian is to understand that God has a plan, even if we do not understand it. It can also be viewed at that God is testing us; when he returns he will judge each person according to what they have done on earth and if they are believers.	5.0	and it was amazing-I felt the music was so beautiful, especially for the story that was being depicted ...	2014-07-07	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2FQYTHR1K0ISY	Annette Munson	"Nearly a decade ago, I sat in a darkened theatre in Kansas City, attempting to view Steven Spielberg's brilliant ""Schindler's List"" for the first time. Highly respectful of the director's factual (and unflinching) presentation of a world plunged into madness, I nevertheless fled the auditorium little more than halfway before the film's conclusion. A scene involving a cherubic Jewish child - and the lengths to which the frightened boy took to escape certain death at the hands of Nazi barbarity - so overwhelmed me that I could remain in my seat no longer. Weeping and shaking with revulsion and sorrow, I eventually regained my composure with great travail and returned home - and resumed my place amidst a generation that had never directly known war.I recently purchased the VHS version of ""Schindler's List"" - and was at last able to view the film in its entirety. Spielberg's masterwork boasts two bravura performances: Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler and Ralph Fiennes as Nazi kingpin Amon Goeth. In Neeson's capable hands, Schindler emerges as a man of deeply rooted flaws - and an ultimate redemption of staggering resonance. The paradoxes are abundant: Schindler is a member of the Nazi party - yet he saved many Jews from certain death in the gas chambers. A practicing Catholic (a religion which purports to champion the sanctity of all human life), his initial fealty to a genocidal racist (Hitler) is somehow swept under the vestments. A keenly savvy businessman, he was also a profiteer of slave labor. Possessed of sexual magnetism and evident charisma, he nevertheless conducts his casual assignations with thinly veiled arrogance. (Early in the film, Schindler is seen complaining about the need to replace his workers when one of them is shot or deported. He is not so much sorrowful as he is petulant. In another scene, Schindler's wife literally walks in on one of his plethoric affairs. He is not so much regretful as he is annoyed at being caught, somewhat akin to an adolescent when his lollipop and/or outer infant is removed and he has to look for yet another opiate.) Like many of his fellow Nazis, Schindler is a man of extravagant appetites - whoring, drinking and eating with a great deal of noise - and little subtlety. (Spielberg deftly juxtaposes these scenes against portrayals of the deprivation and suffering inflicted upon the Jews.) Schindler's dichotomy is so pervasive that, even when he attempts to be compassionate (such as his obvious concern for Goeth's long-suffering female servant) - the audience (not to mention the servant herself) is initially on edge - half expecting him to molest her - and the other half breathing a sigh of relief at his sympathy.Fiennes is simply astonishing in his portrayal of the murderous Goeth. In a Nazi party boasting a surfeit of bestiality, Goeth was particularly snake-like. In an early scene, the sadistic assassin stands idly on the balcony of his sumptuous villa, coldly perusing the mournful parade of half-starved Jewish laborers. Soon, pre-alcoholic senility and post-coital torpor surrender to action:  Amon has an itch.  His copious gut jiggling southward like an epileptic jello-mold, the porcine pasha reaches for his rifle. Goeth then randomly shoots two Jews before slithering into his bathroom to ciphon the python. In another seminal scene, Fiennes brilliantly portrays the conflicted desire Goeth harbored for his Jewish housekeeper and cook. ""Is this the face of a rat?"" the tortured Goeth asks himself while contemplating animal coupling. (Mercifully, the helpless servant wasn't forced to engage in this act of obscenity, but was nonetheless beaten by the beast.) As anyone who has observed Fiennes in interview montages is acutely aware, the talented actor is a genteel, sensitive artist, with eyes and expression of manifest sensitivity and intelligence.  That Fiennes was able to transform himself into a murderer of such unspeakable evil is a truly stunning feat; his performance is astounding.  With all due respect to Tommy Lee Jones - Fiennes should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1994. (As a testament to his acting chops, five years later the versatile actor would portray a Nazi victim in ""Sunshine"" - with equally disarming skill.)""Schindler's List"" also gives the lie to a pervading myth surrounding Hitler and his henchmen:  The familiar theme of regarding the Jews as somehow ""subhuman"" or ""nothing creatures"" who could (and should) be exterminated at will.  Was Hitler ever able to explain how a non-entity could work at a factory for little or no wages - often during ungodly long hours and under deplorable conditions?  How can one exploit a ""nothing"" for one's own personal gain, as so many Nazis did with manipulation and cunning?  The answer, of course, is that they couldn't have.  Cruelty, man's inhumanity to man, and the primacy of personal choice and conscience (or lack thereof) were at the fore here.  Hitler was, in essence, a liar.  Tragically, he was a  particularly convincing one for far too many.Thankfully, the conclusion of ""Schindler's List"" reverberates with poignancy and reverence. The accomplishment of the perplexing Schindler cannot (and should not) be downplayed: He saved countless lives, and for that he deserves profound respect. However, this film is, chiefly, a triumph for humanity and a great, great accomplishment for Steven Spielberg. For this viewer, Schindler's victory is somewhat ambiguous - and his dichotomy too troubling - to rescue him completely from the shadows."	5.0	Spielberg's Flawless Epic....and a Deeply Flawed Protagonist	2003-04-06	10	7	3
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1FE06N5A77K8W	Annie Feng	"Let me just start saying that I'm usually apprehensive about watching Holocaust movies. I think while the Holocaust is something that every person in the world should be educated on, it is also a subject that is overly flooded in the Hollywood movie industry. Most Holocaust movies show lots of images of how people get tortured, killed, gassed etc, all of which make me sick. And I neither wish to watch more of these make-me-sick movies nor think flooding the audiences with brutal images every year would necessarily ""benefit"" them in terms of education on the subject of genocide, which (I can be no more sensitive about it) merely puts the Holocaust among only one of countless atrocities human beings have committed throughout history. Yet the movie-makers make more genocide movies on the Holocaust than any other. People sometimes don't realize that other crimes against humanity in history, though may not be as systematic, are just as terrible. So I do ask that future film-makers would dwell insights into other aspects of history instead of just doing one thing over and over and over and over.That being said, I would have to say that Schindler's List is the first ""Holocaust"" movie (though I do not see it that way) that truly moved me to tears without losing appetite to eat at the same time. And it is not because it is a relatively ""feel-good"" movie or that there are relatively fewer brutal scenes on the sufferings of the Jews (I'm more okay with watching people getting shot than watching people getting tortured or gassed, pardon me if that sounded terrible), but that the movie conveys powerful and insightful messages that digs deeper than just ""racism is bad,"" or ""there are good people in the world."" It tells the story of a powerful and wealthy man who understands the importance of human lives. The end scene in which Schindler weeps over not having saved more lives both trivializes and signifies money and property: money and property are worth nothing when compared to human lives, yet they are of utmost importance because ""for this...one more person."" This powerful message is simply a tear-jerker: a man who did more than anyone else looks around him and weeps shamefully over still having, in his pockets, some potential means to save more lives, little as they are left. From this, Schindler's list teaches something that can be applied to the daily life of anyone, that money and property should be used for those human lives in need to be saved.The Holocaust aspect of the this movie also shed light on the account much more than other Holocaust movies I've seen. It not only shows madness in the face of evil, but just how inhuman the Jews look to the Nazis. The Nazis would just go about their business and socialize while shooting the Jews like squashing bugs as hobbies. The look on the Nazi's faces are not sadism so much as apathetic, which puts the horror and madness onto a different level, it truly defines the extremities of segregation, to be put on the bottom of the barrel.the last thing I want say is that the score is simply brilliant. This is truly one of the best films in history in every way."	5.0	one of the most beautiful movie I have ever seen	2008-12-07	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AWI5YJF7TCN92	"""anonymous_chick"""	I too used to think Spielberg's being snubbed at the Oscars was a question of politics, but then I saw &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and have since changed my tune.  SL is not a bad film, but it is marred by that signature  Spielbergian touch that worked so well in his earlier films, but is  downright sickening here--that  &quot;Oh-look-what-a-clever-director-I-am!&quot; precocious feel.  In a  strange way, Schindler's List is a &quot;cute&quot; film of the Holocaust,  because it is slathered with the cuteness (the &quot;Awww&quot; factor)of  the precociousness Spielberg once had but has failed to outgrow.  Case in  point--the scene when Schindler watches a little girl stumble through the  streets of a Nazi ghetto being purged by the Nazis. A better, more mature  director would have just let that scene play out on it's own--it's haunting  enough as it is-- but, NO, Spielberg just HAD to have her coat hand-colored  (in a Hallmarkian pink, no less!) to have us go, &quot;Awwwwww!&quot;  On  one hand, it's a cheap trick that dampens the powerful evocativeness it  would have had if left alone (worse yet, it's not even original--the fact  that he uses a well-known sentimental device used ad nauseum on gift boxes,  cards and other gift shop items points to the obviousness of why he used  it);but on the other hand, it has that, &quot;Oh, look how clever I was to  have used that device!&quot; feel to it.  Much of SL--despite the graphic  violence and dark subject matter--is like that, just one big Hallmark Card;  i.e., emotionally manipulative without letting the horror of the Holocaust  play out for itself.  In other words, we could have really felt the  intensity of how bad things really were, if Spielberg had just stopped  telling us how to feel about it; but that's classic Spielberg, and until he  realizes that the precociousness that won him such fame in his earlier days  has to be outgrown, he'll never get the recognition he thinks he deserves.  But don't take my word for it; see the movie for yourself.	3.0	A HALLMARK CARD VERSION OF THE HOLOCAUST	1999-12-10	37	10	27

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1MRM5SCEFES5H	Antonio Llanos	"Schindler's List (1993) directed by Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson played Oskar Schindler. The movie (a true History) is set in Poland during World War II. After the Polish army was defeated by the German army, thousands of Jews were ordered to register with the Nazis and relocate to major cities. Oskar Schindler was a business man that needed capital to start a business, and he finds help on Itzhak Stern A Jewish accountant that introduce him to a couple of Jews that agree to lend Mr. Schindler money to start a factory making pans and pots using Jewish labor. The business started good, he was making money and getting to know the Germans and making relations with them, buying them dinners, presents (mostly liquor), fine cigars, caviar and women. Workers in Schindler's factory were allowed outside the ghetto, and Stern falsified documents to ensure that as many people as possible were deemed ""essential"" to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps, or being killed. SS lieutenant Amon Goeth arrives to oversee the construction of the of Plaszow concentration camp while in there he orders the liquidation of the ghetto where Germans will remove Jews from the overpopulated rooms where they were living and move them to the concentration camp, anyone that protested would be killed. Goeth also killed Jews indiscriminately most of the time for no reason at all, he would use them as target practice, at least once he tried to be good to the Jews but he could not do it and ended killing a boy just because he was cleaning a tub.Oskar Schindler saw all this atrocities and gradually became concern for the Jewish that worked at his factory; he changed from producing pans and pots to a munitions factory for the Germans, together with Itzhak Stern came up with a list of Jewish people that they both knew and presented it to the German authorities as skilled workers that he wanted for his factory.  . In all he made a list of about one thousand names that were send to work in his factory, in seven months his factory did not passed any test and the quality of his products was bad but the Jewish working there were safe and protected, Schindler spent all his millions to sustain his workers and bribe the German officials.Finally German unconditional surrender was signed to the allies to end the war, after 6 years of terror, Jews would be free. When Schindler was going to leave he was given a ring made by the Jewish in the camp, the material it was made of came from someone's teeth  and had an encryption in Hebrew from the Torah that said ""whoever save one life, saves the world entire"" and also a letter that everyone signed, but before he left he started to regret not being able to save more people and all the money he wasted that could have used to save more people The movie ends with the Jewish he saved honoring his tomb, Oskar Schindler died in 1974.This movie is a memory of the worse time in human history, but it also reflects how someone can make a difference in people's lives if we just do not think about ourselves only but everyone else. Although Oskar Schindler helped the Jewish and keeps them safe he wanted them to maintain his identity and towards the end of the movie he asks one of his workers to remember that it was Friday and it was Sabbath (a day dedicated for rest and worship)."	5.0	Schindler's list Review	2012-03-21	3	2	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2H4IZRNILUSMB	atmorton	"This movie was about a man named Oskar Schindler who capitalized on the Jews' misfortune during WWII. He used the Jews in captivity to run his factories so that he could get by without paying them and build a much higher profit. As he gains respect and clout in the community, he is able to keep the Jews that work for him from being sent off to concentration and death camps. The word spreads that working for Schindler is a way to keep from being sent away to these camps and from being killed, so many people try to come work for him by boasting their skills and abilities, whether they have them or not. His factories become a sort of ""safe zone"" for the Jewish people who work there. As the story progresses, we see Schindler start to soften towards the Jewish people's dire situation and he begins to sympathize with them. In one moving scene, tons of prisoners were crammed into train carts--shoulder to shoulder--in the middle of a hot summer day with no food or water and no way out. The Nazi soldiers were ignoring their cries of desperation as the heat and dehydration panicked them, but Schindler came around to them with a garden hose and sprayed it along the carts so that they could have some water. The Nazi soldiers looked on and laughed because they knew these people were being taken to the death camps anyway and didn't see a reason to make their last few days on earth any more comfortable. But at that moment, Schindler seemed to have a softened heart towards the Jews and we were able to see his transformation from a greedy, womanizing friend to the Nazis into a sympathetic man who felt for the victims of the war.This movie, while it focuses mainly on the transformation of Oskar Schindler, shows the real way Jews were treated during the war. It doesn't really show the worst and most horrifying parts of the Holocaust, but it shows enough to let the viewer know what kind of fear the Jews were forced to live in. The film is one of many Holocaust-centered films, and like the others, it emphasizes the importance of this event in world history. Clearly, it is an event that will not soon be forgotten and is still studied in depth today and is remembered by Jews everywhere, especially ones who have family or ancestors that were involved in the tragedy. I think this film is just one of many that can give viewers (no matter their religious affiliation) insight into the horrors that can come from hatred towards another person for their beliefs."	3.0	A Different Perspective	2012-04-20	4	1	3

There is a multitude of heartfelt scenes: frame by frame, scene by scene, and brilliance by brilliance. To see it again and again is to experience the joyous of filmmaking. This is the film that makes Steven Spielberg the greatest modern day filmmaker to ever live. D.W. Griffith was brilliant in his time and influenced how movies are made. Sergei Eisenstein gave something that forever changed the way movies are viewed. Alfred Hitchcock developed brilliance through techniques. Steven Spielberg took everything in and made into a culmination of one, and the result is Schindler's List. No film has this amount of acting, drama, emotions, atmosphere, stark truth and reality, and violence with humanity like Schindler's List. Moreover, it is undoubtedly the most important picture of humankind because Schindler's List tells a story to future audiences that evil can exist and how they can understand it. To see what had happened, the heroes of Schindler's List teach the values of life. I've never been more impressed when Steven Spielberg brought together two ordinary actors and got them to create something that is so extraordinarily great. Ralph Fiennes is the epitome of sexuality in an evil way. Schindler's List is through and through a definite masterpiece that has no rivals. Truth be told, it is absolutely impossible to regard this film anything less than perfection. Never have I seen a character so complex like Oskar Schindler.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AT6JVS8F5L23C	Autumn11e	"Oskar Schindler was a German businessman who saved the lives of 1,100 mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. He was a part of the Nazi party and he had many friends very high up in the Nazi ranks. Liam Neeson played the part of Schindler and I think this was one of his best roles. Steven Spielberg directed the movie. It won seven academy awards. I cried so much in the end.  Many Jews and Non-Jews really questioned God and their own faith after this horrific event occurred in history. Over 6 million Jews were murdered during this genocide. A lot of people wondered how God could, if there really was one could allow this to happen. And the only answer that seems to make any sense is God gave man free will to do right or wrong. And I think this movie showed that in the mist of the Holocaust, glimmers of God shown though in the way of people like Oskar Schindler. He could have been killed by the Nazi party doing what he did and he did it anyway all for the benefit of other human beings. He was arrested at one point but he kept on fighting for these people. He never gave up. He lied many times about unskilled workers such as kids or elders to be an asset to the factor. He even allowed his workers to pray in a minyan daily. He spent all of his fortune keeping these people safe. No one knows what Schindler's motives were for saving all these people but he was once quoted saying ""I knew the people who worked for me... When you know people, you have to behave towards them like human beings."" This movie touched my heart on a very deep level."	5.0	Schindler's List	2012-07-07	0	0	0

Morris ""BeansMommy"""	"I have seen this movie many times,but it has been awhile.I just rewatched it, and felt compelled to write a review on it.The movie is Stephen Spielberg's masterpiece on the Holocaust, and it is a totally unforgetable movie.The acting is AWESOME, and the fact that it is shot in black and white only adds to the authenticity of it.The main character is Oskar Schindler, a nazi-German living in Poland during WW2.Although he was a womanizer, and a nazi, he also had great feeling for the Jewish prisoners, and saved thousands of them from sure death, just by coming to work for him in his factory...Schindler Jews were treated MUCH better than other Jewish prisoners of this time period.What really boggles my mind about the Holocaust is that these atrocities done to the Jewish people happened in fairly MODERN times...it is just hard to get over that fact, and especially while watching this movie, and seeing jews shot and killed for such unbelivably small things like looking a nazi in the eye, or talking out of turn...it is just unbelivable.Anyway, the movie basically focuses on Oskar Schindler, and how he helped these people along the way.He fed them right, and did not beat them or abuse them in other ways. He also let them practice thier religion which was UNTHINKABLE back then,And most importantly, he let them all go when the war was over, and that was where the list comes in.He and his loyal secretary and friend (a jew), made a list thatbroke Schindler by ""buying"" over a thousand Jews who would have surely died, as most jews did in the end.This movie has so many unforgettable scenes in it.One in particular was where hundreds of Schindler's women were mistakenly misrouted to the wrong camp, and they were horrified.They were supposed to meet thier husbands and children at schindler's camp, but ended up all stripped down and loaded into what they thought was a gas chamber.When water (instead of gas) came pouring out on them they all cried in relief. It was terrible.The train scene was also VERY disturbing. The jews were packed like sardines into railroad cars waiting to ride, on the hottest day imaginable.They were actually baking alive in the cars. Schindler ordered fire hoses to be turned on the cars, and water to be given to them.These small acts of kindness is actually what saved many lives.Again I say this movie is probably the most important movie ever made.It is a dark piece of history,yet it needs to be looked at, and never forgotten.Modern day Jewish people STILL flock to visit Oskar Schindler's grave, and leave a stone on it.As for Mr. Schindler;On the night his Jews were freed, he became a fugitive himself."	5.0	One of the most important movies ever made.	2007-11-17	3	1	2
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ALR35EFI69S5R	"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman"""	"This is an extremely troubling, scrupulously accurate, and endlessly  compelling screen adaptation of Thomas Keneally's non-fiction best seller  depicting the events surrounding Oscar Schindler's acts in saving hundreds  of Polish Jews from certain death in the concentration camps by employing  them in manufacturing ""essential materials"" in war-time Poland. Steven  Spielberg negotiates his way carefully through the potential minefield of  controversy in his stunningly graphic and emotional portrayal of the plight  of Polish Jews as the Germans began their preparations for what became the  ""Final Solution"" to the ""Jewish Question"" in the occupied sectors of Poland  in the early 1940s.As a serious student of 20th century history, I am  indeed impressed by the care with which Spielberg has faithfully recreated  the details of the occupation, from Schindler's initial entrepreneurial  preoccupation with exploiting Jewish investors and workers for his own  profit to the moral indifference and cruelty of Christian Poles toward  their Jewish countrymen. The scenes early in the movie depicting the Jews  being forcibly ejected from their homes and the trail of local residents  taunting and abusing them is among the powerful on film, as are the later  episodes showing the barbarism of the Nazis both within the Jewish ghetto  and in the streets, casually murdering Jews as simply as squashing a  noisome mosquito. The story line provides the viewer with a profound  opportunity to be an eyewitness to one of the most shameful and sorry  periods in modern world history, as we witness just how base and cruel  ordinary human beings can be.The cast, of course, is absolutely  terrific, from Liam Neeson to Ben Kingsley to Ralph Fiennes. In particular,  Fiennes' brilliant portrayal of a Nazi officer capable of such casual  violence as to nonchalantly order a Jewish engineer shot because she  corrects an error made by incompetent German military engineers gives a  glimpse into the maddening darkness and banality of evil. Once again,  modern American film shows us why serious cinematic efforts like this must  be actively sponsored and appreciated. If a photo is worth a thousand  words, this breathtaking film is worth a library. It accurately illustrates  in its short three or four hours duration more about the individual reality  of what world war meant to each of the millions of noncombatants who  perished at the hands of evil incarnate than any book may do. This is a  movie I plan to use to teach European history to lethargic high-schoolers  to wake them out of their self-absorption into an active interest in the  world. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to better understand what  the Holocaust meant, and how it happened."	5.0	Stark &amp; Troubling Look At The Realities Of The Holocaust!	2000-09-04	11	8	3

There are no words to describe such a landmark film. Steven Spielberg proves once again why he is one of the best filmmakers of all time. If not THE best. If you disagree, you are a sad person in a very small group. Filmed in beautiful black and white, the film was based on the book by author Thomas Keneally. It deals, as if you didn't know, about the holocaust during World War II. A man who seemed to be an unlikely hero tried to help. That man was Oskar Schindler, who was a war profiteer. He put his life on the line to save as many jews from concentration camps as he could. The role was superbly played by Liam Neeson. He delivers a wonderful and Oscar nominated performance. The most amazing job comes from Ralp Fiennes, who plays an evil nazi. A man so vicious that he shoots jews from his balcony as practice. An astonishing and unforgettable character and performance. Ben Kingsley rounds out the cast. The movie is raw and brutal. Nothing is glammed up or &quot;Hollywoodized&quot; at all. Thank god for that. The movie is very frank and up front about what happened. I can only imagine what the film would've been like if it was in color. Thankfully, it's not. The black and white fits better. Spielberg is a brilliant visionary of unprecedented talent. He knows hwo to give us thrilling summer movies, and then he turns right around and gives us jaw dropping films on real life like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, &quot;Empire Of The Sun&quot;, and &quot;Amistad&quot;. This film is his greatest achievement. &quot;Ryan&quot; might tie with it. This is a film that everyone needs to see. No matter what. This is important and educational. You'll be a better person for it. One of the best movies ever made. No question about it.	5.0	An Important And Remarkable Film	2002-01-17	11	8	3

This film is very empty, for not only does it portray the Germans as &#34;evil, lop-sided, devil worshippers&#34; but it shows the Jews as being &#34;promising, alluring, good guys&#34;. If one is to question morality, then do so, but do not give us the black vs white issue found in this film. Speilberg, immature since day one as director, tells us what to think, he strips away our humanity by overdosing us on excessive amounts of guilt and sentimentality. In effect, the film lacks any moral basis except to denounce all evil men and with that, we learn absolutely nothing.....	1.0	Holocaust as Family Drama, Awful Junk	2014-01-23	19	2	17

An avid movie buff for years, there is simply no other film which has had the same impact on me as this utter masterpiece by Spielberg. I will never forget seeing it the first time in the theater. I was so stunned that I could not cry during the film itself. About 20 minutes later, while dropping my girlfriend off at her house, I simply lost it. It was as if all the impact of the film hit at once. I cried for 15 minutes straight. What a testament to the power of this film. That feeling has never left me. I am 41 years old and have no family relation to the horrors of the Holocaust, but Steven Spielberg made me feel, deep inside, the unspeakable anquish of this uniquely evil event in history. Simply put, every person on earth should see this film to truly understand the evil that is possible on this earth. ""Schindler's List"" is a testament of remembrance to the 6 million Jews and others who died.

Filmed in gritty b/w, it is nevertheless the stunning, stark adaptation of how Oskar Schindler (superb job by Liam Neeson) has a change of heart and decides to save 1,000 Jews in ww2 Poland.Fully deserving the Oscars and Oscar nominations it received, of which Liam Neeson rightfully deserved a Best Actor nomination, while the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars went to this outstanding motion picture and to Steven Spielburg.This movie ranks at the top of the must-see Spielburg films, along with E.T. But avoid his latest films, such as A.I. Sure, A.I. has a good cast, but the superficial script and cheap-looking cinematography pales in comparison to this 1993 masterpiece and Spielburg's 1982 triumph, E.T.Rated R for violence, nudity and for language."	5.0	Stunning Oscar-winner that deserves what it receives	2002-02-15	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A281387UUS2IN5	Beantown Jim	Combine the director talents of Steven Spielberg, the production company resources he can summon, with the weightiest subject in recent cinema (the 'Holocaust'...i.e. Hitler's destruction of European Jewry, gypsies, and Slavs), you have the makings of a great film.  This film doesn't disappoint.Liam Neeson is mis-cast as Oscar Schindler, having no Germanic presence whatsoever.  However, as a great actor that commands respect and dominates the set, he somehow overcomes this and is absolutely mesmerizing.  Ben Kingsley as the liaison between the Jewish internees and plant owner Schindler is quietly efficient in performing his role.  Other actors do their bit in painting the grand canvas of the German occupation of Poland and the horrors that followed.The film is filmed in black and white in order to jibe with our memories of films and photos of the time, plus allowing an occasional color tracer to permeate a scene.  The sets are adequate, if not perfectly accurate, and the massive vistas, true to form for Spielberg (he does nothing small or on the cheap), are what really makes the film.]I used to think these were universal themes for everyone, but that is not true.  I've met several people to whom this was just history, not living or emotional history.  A surprise, but good to know.  To them, this film is interesting and well-done, but not the catharsis that I had and most viewers had in the US and, interestingly enough, in Germany when it was shown on national TV...	5.0	Another 'must have' addition to your DVD library	2014-01-18	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2IAR5XDY0KT2F	Becky	&quot;He who saves a single life saves the world entire.&quot;This was the Talmudic verse that Itzhak Stern, the bookishly serious accountant/friend/conscience of Oskar Schindler quoted to him in one of the movie's final scenes.On the face of it, Oskar Schindler was the most unlikely hero one is ever likely to hear about.  Lusty, earthy, and sensual, he was a reckless philanderer, a gambler, a member of the Nazi party and someone who saw the war as an opportunity to become wealthy.  But to the Jews who were fortunate enough to encounter him, he was quite literally their saviour.Spielberg succeeds with this film on two stupendous levels.  Firstly it is with the documentation of the humanisation and conscience of a man who originally saw the war as a personal opportunity and who, at the end of the 6 years, had gone bankrupt in his mission to save &quot;his&quot; Jews.  Secondly, and most disturbingly, it is with the graphic re-creation of some of the most horrific and barbaric acts ever committed by mankind, all in the name of prejudice and oppression.  Such is the reality of these scenes that viewers will feel outraged, afraid, paralysed, and oppressed.  Most of all, they will feel as if they too, had the supreme misfortune to be European Jews living under the dark cloud of prejudice and hatred that permeated the globe during the interminable period of the second world war.  And it will leave us asking the one answerable question - &quot;Why?&quot;Perhaps, as Oskar Schindler viewed these scenes firsthand, that is how he too felt.  An odd dichotomy in his character enabled him to fraternise with high ranking Nazi officials, especially the demonic Amon Goeth, while, unlike Goeth and his peers, treating &quot;his&quot; Jews with the humanity and civility that was so scarce during this age of insanity, of loss, of suffering and death.  Never before or since has ethnic cleansing succeeded so brutally in decimating the population of an entire race.  We must pray that it never does again.Schindler's story has risen like a phoenix from the ashes of this dark time.  It is a story of hope, courage, and survival.  But more than that it is the story of a man who chose good over evil, who chose love over hate, who chose understanding over prejudice.  Is it any wonder that a tree on the Avenue of the Righteous bears his name?There are a few names which have become branded in our psyche as being synonymous with the horrors of the Holocaust.  Anne Frank, whose diary etched her life and death into the hearts of millions, Simon Wiesenthal, himself an Auschwitz survivor who lost over 80 family members in the death camps, and now of course, there is Oskar Schindler, a man who was far from saintly, but a man whose deeds guaranteed him a place in heaven.  A man who &quot;saved the world entire.&quot;	5.0	When a name on a list was a life that was saved	2000-10-22	5	4	1

A 5-star film deserves AT LEAST 4-star treatment.  Seriously, who wants to stop halfway through a film and flip the disc over to continue their viewing pleasure?  Fortunately for Warner Bros., they are redeeming themselves by re-releasing Goodfellas in a format a film of its caliber deserves - a member of the Two Disc Special Edition set with the likes of Casablanca, Citizen Kane, and Singin in the Rain.Now, Universal?  In 2004, well into the age of the DVD?  Where high quality picture, special features, and two-disc special editions reign supreme?  How could a film such as Schindler's List receive the treatment that Goodfellas (forgiving Warner Bros. a bit, they did release Goodfellas before the current DVD age) first received?  Universal has released a 5-star film during a time when DVDs are providing the film viewer, like never before, a crystal clear, specially packaged backstage pass to experience their favorite films in a 2-star set straight out of the 20th century.  The LEAST Schindler's List deserved was to have the viewer have to take a separate disc out of the package and insert it into the DVD player halfway through the film, not flip the same disc over (Geez, even the supposedly &quot;cheap&quot; distribution people over at Miramax had the respect for a film like Gangs of New York - not even in the same league as Schindler's List - to place the second half of the film on another disc).  Seriously Universal, you had quite a few years to develop this project and offer it the treatment it deserved.  It's unfortunate this wonderful film experience wasn't shown more respect and at least given two discs to share its message on.Treatments such as this were meant for &quot;flicks&quot; like Battlefield Earth and Crossroads.	2.0	Cheap treatment for an excellent film	2004-03-10	22	12	10

Be it the screenplay, the acting, the direction, the cinematography or the music score. This film is simply  masterful in all respects.It is a highly complex drama that touches many  issues (heroism, moral choice, human nature among others), still it is  never pretentious or didactic. It also manages to be a technically superior  film without being jingoistic or self-indulgent. Despite its  three-hour-plus length, &quot;Schindler's List&quot; never loses momentum  and sometimes even succeeds in being entertaining as  well.&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is really an exceptional movie. A film  of rare emotional and intelectual power and impact. The only  Spielberg-films that were even more commercially successful in Germany were  &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

Like ""John Wayne vs Hitler""...I must admit I'm a little unfair: Mr Spielberg did make an effort here. He's trying to recreate some of Visconti's magic (see ""the Damned""), and to set aside much of his Hollywoodness. The result is not quite convincing to me. Don't misunderstand me: this is not an anti-American charge at all: American cinema has been and still is one of the best in the world, and I'm a great consumer of it; but an American movie is never better than when it's set in the US...I also agree with the reviewer below who stressed how 'inappropriate' it is to produce such conventionnal emotional effects with such tragic historical events..."	3.0	Hollywood Europe	2003-06-24	14	5	9
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A46NPO3VKOZPJ	Bella Cohen	This movie is beyond 5 stars. After seeing this in 1995 i was truley facinated by Speildbergs telling of the life of Oskar Schindler. The way the film is in black and white totally sets the theme and telling of the time period. Being Jewish myself, i had read much about the horror of time. After seeing this film, it gave me a deeper look into what some of my distant relatives in Hungary had to expirience... the ghettos, the camps, the aftermath... The way Speildberg filmed it was just remarkable, it seemed as if it were actually in the time. This true story tells of how a man named Oskar Schindler, a man who saved thousands of Jews from their fate at the death camps, by placing them in his factories, providing a safe haven. But i must warn you...after seeing this film you will never be the same..this film gave me a deeper pride of my religon. And whether if you are Jewish or not, i guarantee that you this film will really make you think...and change the way you look things. This powerfull film has very graphic images and i warn you with caution, but it is worth seeing. This film is a once in a lifetime film, i reccomend it to all those who want to feel more of the great human spirit...and how one mans decision changed the life of thousands.	5.0	A Remarkable, Breathtaking Film...	2002-02-15	2	1	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AH1KJ45IQTM4T	Benjamin	I rate this movie 9.5/10 or 5 stars. This movie is among the 1000 Best Movies in DVD's by Peter Travers and in the Top 10 list of Best American Movies Ever. The movie won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Director. Steven Spielberg directs this movie 10 years after he read the book for the first time and was completely fascinated with the story. As a Jewish himself, he brings to the screen the story of those Jews who survived the Holocaust thanks to one man -Oskar Schindler-, who gave them the opportunity to work in his factories during the end of World War II. The movie shows the brutality of the Nazi army against the Jews, and how they were being killed at different Death Camps (Auswitch, etc.). The movie is based on true facts collected after the testimony of many people who experienced the Holocaust and survived. The movie is rated R for obvious reasons and it is very difficult to contain the tears. This DVD Collector's Gift Set edition is absolutely wondeful, including a special plexiglas casing, a picture book showcasing images by photographer David James with a foreword by Spielberg, the Original Soundtrack by the Oscar winner and always superb John Williams, and a rare limited edition senitype individually numbered and made from a actual film frame from the movie. (So the price it's just a bargain with all of that!). I want to say that, despite not being a Jewish nor coming from a country involved in World War II, I feel absolutely moved by the story told here and I have enormous respect and empathy for the Jewish community and for all the atrocities they have gone through their history. This is a necessary movie that needed to be done and needs to be seen by as many people as possible, so we don't make the same mistakes in the future. We are all human beings, and we all deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless our religion, ethnicity, race, social status, sexual orientation, etc. Unfortunately today, we are still witness of so many intolerance and bigotry that makes me feel embarassed and very sad. We all should work together for human peace, love and understanding among all peoples from all countries in the world. This movie helps people understand how important it is to know each other and understand each other, so ignorance and hatred does not govern our lifes.P.S. If you like my review vote YES. You can read all my other reviews if you wish to. I modestly write them to help people form an opinion about movies, music and books, but if nobody reads them (if you don't vote I do not know if you did) there is no point in writing them.	5.0	Necessary	2007-06-16	5	4	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AR37967IAR6ZT	Benjamin	"""Schindler's List"" is, beyond question, one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. Profoundly sad and incredibly well-acted, it's the best Holocaust drama ever made, deserving of every accolade it's received since its release in 1994 - where it became a box-office hit despite its time length, black-and-white cinematography and bleak subject matter.I'm incredibly glad this is finally going to be released on DVD, and I would hope that it would be a staple of most serious filmgoers' collections.But there's something about ""Schindler's List"" that a friend of mine once pointed out to me.Certainly, it's great, but how many times can you watch it? It's a difficult, if important, film experience, and my friend asked me why I would want to own it. It's not one of those movies that you can really, dare I use the term, ""enjoy.""I doubt anyone's said, ""Hey, it's raining. Let's watch SCHINDLER'S LIST again! That'll be fun!""When I saw it in theaters with my father, he said it was an amazing film, and he hoped never, ever to have to watch it again because of the profound impact it has. I own a VHS copy of it, and I sadly have never been able to sit through it in its entirety. It's too harrowing.Ben Kingsley, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Embeth Davidtz are really good in the film, but it's not a film that you can detach yourself from and admire from a distance - even to admire the tremendous skill and dedication of everyone involved in the project.Though it's amazing, you are put in a really uncomfortable emotional place while watching ""Schindler's List,"" and it's not an easy experience many people are willing to endure more than once."	5.0	Maybe this is a moot point.	2004-01-07	8	6	2

Greathouse	"As someone who has studied the Holocaust for 12 years, and as someone who cried when this film was over, I must say that this film is quite inaccurate. All you have to do is read the book ""Schindler's Legacy"". Yes, Schindler was a good man for doing what he did. But, truth is, the list was taken over by members of the Jewish police and kapos (work group leaders), and, generally, only the people with the right connections or, more importantly, the right amount of money, got them and their families on the list! Don't get me wrong, this film has great cinematography and very very good acting, but it kind of irks me that the story was kind of altered to make it into a dramatic picture. The Holocaust was dramatic enough as it was, and stories dont need to be altered to this degree. And I understand it is based on the Jews, but is there mention of the other 12-13 million people who died under the Nazi regime? If there is, I am sorry, but I havent seen it. Yes, Schindler did good things, he had a factory that sheltered lives of Jews. But he really had very little to do with the list."	3.0	great filming and writing, but not accurate	2005-08-21	14	6	8

While more than 3 hours long it is never boring and has a pace that most 1 movies would die for. Superb acting by Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler, he gives a quietly powerful  performance that says it all, Ben Kingsley is also great as his accountant,  but the most realistic performance comes from Ralph Fiennes who plays the  mercyless nazi, he draws his character so perfectly that when he shoots the  jews we actually expect it. But it's the direction of Steven Spielberg that  makes the film extraordinary. He stamps the film with his own brand of  story-telling creating an extremely entertaining, fascinating, horrifying  and ultimately poignant film experience.

Schindler's List is such a haunting masterpiece I get chills whenever I hear the soundtrack. Everything is done so dramatically and it all fits together so perfectly it's like your there as its occuring. It's a movie that with all the bad things going on in the world there are still (Some) good people and we can all relate to that. After the engrossing 3 and a hald hour movie is over you relize that the holocaust really did happen and in some parts of the world genocidal activities really do still take place.This movie is NOT for the weak of heart as it graphically depicts humans being beat, shot, tortured, starved, and even gassed in hauntingly graphic sequences. Kids shouldn't see this movie as many children are depicted being murdered. We can all learn a lesson from this movie...whatever it be.	5.0	One of my favorite historical movies.	2005-05-25	5	3	2

At least to me, it was pretty obvious that Spielberg knew he was writing on a very sensative topic  and that he could still get his point across without dragging people to the  theaters to see three hours of merciless, blood-and-guts massacring of  innocent men, women and children. In fact, I thought the sparse colour  (seen in only a few points throughout the movie) is used for more evocative  (less brutal) purposes this way. I apologize to those of you who were  disappointed with not being able to see the slaughter of hundreds of people  in Braveheart like colour...maybe you should try another movie.	5.0	Explanation of Black and White	1999-11-17	8	5	3

Schindlers list is a powerful war movie and is rather long, but it is well worth a patient watch, there will be no dry eyes at the end of this classic movie.The gas chambers were especially disturbing with actors like Brett Weston being extremely hard to look at.probably spielberg's best and one of the alltime greatest movies	5.0	schindlers list	2001-10-23	3	1	2

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1GOW5PNZ0YSMT	Book B	The packaging with 1 reversible DVD is beyond my understanding.  There is no safe place to touch the disk and honestly, I would have rather had 2 disks than this nonsense.  Why not a Blu-Ray?  Forget about Hi-Def and that stuff, how about Blu-Ray so you can fit it on just one disk and not have to reverse the disk and ruin the mood or the movie?About the movie.  I have watch it several times and soaked in the story.  I liked it.  It was hard to watch at times, and brutally inhuman other times.  This time I decided to watch the film for technical reasons, even though the story would distract me at times.  So far I have noticed one flaw that seemed to me to be inexcusable.  In the scene where Amon is timing a Jew making a hinge, he then takes the Jew out to shoot him so he can make room for people coming to the camp (from Yugoslavia).  He first uses a Luger to shoot, but it jams many times, then he pulls out what looks like a 9mm Glock out of his right pocket that jams as well, constantly pulling the chamber back and forth to mount the round...nothing.  Amon finally butts the worker in the head and walks off dropping THAT gun on the ground and another officer picks it up.  If you look closely, that gun he drops is now SUDDENLY a revolver, not a Glock, as different a handgun as you can get.  How set design can miss that baffles me.  Honestly in an intense seen like that to then mess it up by not providing the correct set prop shows how overwhelmed the set crew was or how little they cared about consistency.  I will now go through the entire film  looking for more of these inconsistencies.  I have found several camera angle mishaps so far which are minor, showing a lack of attention to detail in the editing room, but I am looking for clear mistakes.  None of this distracts from the message of the film or my like for it, but I have seen it enough times that the errors are now the only parts that are different each time I view it.Liam Neeson is phenomenal.  Without him the movie is without direction.  Ralph Fiennes provides the urgency the film needs to be intense and provocative.  Both men are attractive to the point of distraction and ideally suited to their roles.  Ben Kingsley is why this film has a purpose.  Without his frank and casual performance, Ralph would be lost and Liam would have nothing to do.  And then there is probably the most evasive and mindful roles in the film portrayed by Embeth Davidtz as Helen Hirsch.  Her role is quiet but shows powerfully the good side of Amon.  Amon is a hard character, harsh, unyielding and relentless.  Embeth Davidtz's conviction playing Helen shows how Amon can be taken down with kindness and sincerity.  Her role, while small and simple, stands out to me as the more memorable roles in the film, representing tolerance, fear, hope, passion, and despair.  If Ben's role was one of quiet indifference and obsequience to the Germans, then Embeth's role as Helen was to wear that obedience at arms length, heart in her hands, affected, showing feeling in her face.  At all times I thought she might run away and yet she persisted out of fear but unwilling to just lay down and die to be free, and that conflict swirled around the other actor's making the film complex, deep and meaningful for me.  Nicely done.If only the film was technically flawless.....	5.0	Fine film, packaging is poor	2012-11-24	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3DM08AHYJHS0P	"""boxingelena2000"""	Highlights: A confident and candid directorial approach; faultless performances from the entire cast; stunning cinematography; stridently evocative script.Lowpoints: Occasional slips into superfluous sappiness; uncompromisingly dismal; overlong.Conclusion: Steven Spielberg's follow-up to the regrettable Hook, Schindler's List is a passionate tribute to the kindness of those who saved lives during the vindictive holocaust era. Liam Neeson's performance represents that kindness - he plays the title character with such vigorous conviction that, even when the mostly-poignant script demands him to go along with one of its needless ventures into sentimentality, such as the tear-jerker of a speech he delivers at the film's finale, Neeson handles those scenes with luminous passion and assurance. As, by the way, does the rest of the cast (Ralph Fiennes does `evil film characters' justice), that compensates with its exhilarating performances for the overall lack of sanguinity in the relentlessly cheerless plot. Heartbreaking, convincing and gorgeously shot, Schindler's List is by far THE unsurpassed cinematic portrayal of the horrifying concentration camp events, movingly depicting one man's compassion amongst incensed antagonism.	4.0	ALEXS CAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS	2004-02-29	13	1	12

So the whole movie would have easily fit on one side of a two layered disc, otherwise known as DVD-9. There is just no excuse. This kind of decision was deliberatly made since you just do not see this kind of mastering anymore. Every major DVD since 2000 has been Dual-layer. This is bad, but don't blame Universal. Look what they did for Rob Cohens' Daylight, Dragonheart and Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story. Top drawer DVD's. Not only should this have been a two disc set, with commentary, trailers, photo gallery, featurettes, and dynamic menus, it should have been $3 less that what I paid for it. Splitting a movie across two discs, whether separate or in a flipping arrangment, is just insipid.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3J2CGLKCCPSBE	Bragan Thomas	The critical and commercial success of this slickly produced but ultimately hollow piece of Shoah-kitsch in 1993 has always puzzled me.  If Spielberg were any less than the master technician he is, I'd give this film one star.  The black-and-white photography, which so many have praised, is undeniably lovely in itself, but as a means of lending the story emotional impact and credibility, it is the single worst aesthetic decision Spielberg made for the film.  The technique, deliberately grainy to recall old newsreels, nicely distances the viewer from the action, and ensures that we see this as a story &quot;out of the past.&quot;  This might not have been the case had the cinematographer refrained from the annoying, pseudo-avant-garde technique (seen in every rock video!) of shooting carefully selected fragments (such as the now-famous red coat) in color, another aesthetic decision that calls attention to itself and prevents the viewer from fully identifying with the characters.  Second, for all its &quot;authenticity&quot; (the production design is truly remarkable), the film is filled with the usual Spielbergian cheap, manipulative and blatant emotional appeals - it is an insult to everyone who died in Auschwitz to replicate the style (but not the substance, since the characters aren't actually going to be killed) of the Zyklon-B shower deaths as a suspense scene - this is one of the most sickening things I have ever seen in a movie.  Additionally, huge portions of the script are obvious lifts from such telefilms as John Hersey's THE WALL, about the Warsaw Ghetto, HOLOCAUST, and even THE WINDS OF WAR, such as the woman's killing of her infant to keep it silent lest its crying betray the group...The final sequence, where all of the surviving &quot;Schindler's Jews&quot; are paraded around in living color only underscores the sleaziness of Spielberg's cheap melodrama.  The film also distorts the facts - Oskar Schindler was no &quot;hero&quot; (which the movie at least recognizes), nor was he the only industrialist who made huge profits from using cheap Jewish and prisoner slave labor during the war.  After this film was released, several of the survivors revealed far more ambivalent attitudes towards Schindler than you will see in this film - he may have saved most of their lives, but he also worked them like drayhorses and made money off of them anyway.  I will commend the uniformly fine performances, but this film is wildly overrated.  See A. Holland's EUROPA EUROPA for a film with an almost identical structure to this one, that even incorporates the &quot;real&quot;people at the end without seeming manipulative.	3.0	Typical Spielberg - All technique, no emotion!	2001-04-22	28	9	19

It has all the elements that make a movie great ie. great acting, good story & suspense.  This movie is the story of Oscar Schindler who's greed helped him to begin a manufacturing business which exploited cheap jewish labor for his own benefit.  Through the movie his greed dissipates and humanity surfaces to the point where he continues the company only to help jews from ending up in concentration camps.  Even though the movie is over 3 hours long it flows nicely and you do not get bored with it.  I recommend showing this movie in schools to ensure students understand the gravity of the holocaust.

In preparation to tackle the horror of the Holocaust to make it understood to 15-16 year olds, I read countless accounts and texts on the subject.  I had seen Schindler's List in the theater before I had much knowledge of the subject and was moved.  Seeing it after my research, it is true to history.  Steven Speilberg is, obviously, brilliant.  Students in my classes where moved to tears (even a couple football jocks) and gained a clear understanding of the blind hatred of an ethnicity.  I show the movie and only could show it on VHS.  To be able to have the DVD quality and ability to easily skip past the brief sexual scenes has increased this film's impact in the classroom.  Not a movie to watch with the family on a night of fun but a necessary film for all people to see.

You can take it from Hitler's own words, in his exact words from his book. His vision is portrayed in painful detail in this movie...if you are human you will have trouble watching what is shown.I'd caution any parent allowing anyone under the age of 18 from viewing this film, except for educational purposes; the content requires adult supervision.For the student of history....you should carefully observe this film and correlate it's links to past world history with current history. Nazi's had planned parenthood....Americans have planned parenthood. This is relevant because of the drastic socialist shift within the American state; a shift from individuals to collectives. The jump from abortion to euthanasia is not a big jump. The disarmament of citizens to control of sects is not a big leap. (Destruction of religion, destruction of rights, destruction of the family, destruction of social norms, destruction of the individual human......it has been done before and has one inevitable outcome.)This film is relevant because America is Germany in 1937.	5.0	Socialist State	2013-08-05	0	0	0

(Did you know Spielberg doubted himself, and actually tried to pass off the director's chair to Martin Scorsese, Sydney Pollack and Roman Polanski?)Of course it's more than that: it is not just Spielberg who deserves all the credit, but there is indeed so much credit he does deserve:...It's the powerhouse book by Thomas Keneally calledSchindler's Ark....It's the decision to do it in black and white (save for the girl in red, an idea that came to him when one of the actual camp survivors told the director a story about a four-year old girl shot before his eyes)....It is the sensational acting, led of course by Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley....It is the powerful musical score created by John Williams, including a terrific performance by Itzhak Perlman....It is the crisp, period-inspired and stark realism photography of cinematographer Janusz Kami&#324;ski, who worked without a storyboard....It is the brilliant eye of production designer Allan Starski, whose job it was to darken or lighten the sets so that the actors would not recede into the backdrops (costumes too were addressed in this manner)....And finally, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, let us not forget that it is due to the REAL Oskar Schindler, who did indeed save more than twelve hundred lives by employing them in his factories. Schindler, who died in 1974 in poverty brought about by his liquidating everything he had in order to ""employ"" his mostly Polish-Jewish workers. He was a man who had begun the war as a relatively amoral businessman who knew how to ""work"" the German war machine to profit himself, but eventually found himself a conscience, and did something so simple that no one else seemed to really think of it."	5.0	One of the Great True Classic Films	2013-07-13	0	0	0

He cleverly created jobs in his factory to be filled exclusively by what were deemed as &#34;essential&#34; Jewish workers.

This is a stunning film on so many levels and I am delighted that it is finally back.  I, of course, got the widescreen edition and the picture looks great - crisp and clear, preserving Janusz Kaminski's glorious black and white cinematography.  True, it is rather strange that you need to flip the DVD, especially since so many other 3-hour plus films are on one side.  The special features should have been put on a separate DVD.  You think Spielberg would have wanted to have a direct role in the DVD release, but for some strange reason he did not.  No commentary from him either, which is disappointing.  Oh, well, perhaps he is too busy with his ultra-left wing Hollywood cronies trying to get a Democrat in the White House.  It's a shame when people put politics ahead of their art.  But I digress - this still remains a deeply moving, beautifully made epic.  It's one of the best looking movies of the '90s and maybe of the last fifty years.  In a time when anti-Semitism once again seems to be not only tolerated but fashionable, it remains one of the single most important films ever made.  This should be mandatory viewing in every school everywhere.  A real triumph.	4.0	Great Movie - DVD Is Not as Bad as You've Heard	2004-04-16	5	1	4

I, along with many other people on this site, have had problems with DVD-18s made by Universal, most notably 'Casino' & 'Schindler's List'... the kicker is that the stores will not refund the movie because of copyright laws... they tell you to get another one which freeze and skip also. So due to these problems and Universal's refusal to spend an extra few cents to make another disc, I am BOYCOTTING Universal DVDs. Warner Bros. stopped making doubled sided disc with 'E.R.' & 'West Wing', why can't Universe-smell do the same thing? simple: MONEY. PROFIT. Send them a message, folks. Because this will be the only way they will listen. I shouldn't have to wonder if a movie is gonna play right when I buy it... simply pathetic.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A36ZA5RAYQ1UJE	"""bsullivan2"""	Some people are wondering why Schindler's List is not yet available on DVD.  Well, here's why.  Over the years of the DVD's relatively short life, consumers have come to expect a certain level of extensiveness in terms of content on DVD's.  The fact that the DVD in question here is Schindler's List makes this expectation amplified exponentially.  So the studio can't just throw Schindler's List out on DVD, they really have to treat it like a project, which requires everyone to be involved (and Spielberg's somewhat of a busy guy).  So think of the DVD as a new movie in itself.  When Spielberg & Company decide to make it, they will, and it'll take time.  So be patient!  You're waiting for good reason.  :)	5.0	this is why it's not available yet	2003-09-26	12	9	3

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3HTX1NOTTWERP	Busy Body	Well, where to begin? Usually I can twitter on for pages about a product, but this is a tough one. Well, let me start with my opinion that Schindler's List is the best film ever made, and deserves all the critical praise it has received. Never before have I seen such an emotionally powerful film.I am the grandson of a man who, at the age of 14, was trapped in a concentration camp, before later escaping through some miracle. He wasn't Jewish, but lived in Russia and was hauled off one day when he found out that his father had been dead for months, even though he continued to receive letters from him. He later discovered the letters had been written by the Nazis, and sent to him as a cover up. He refused to talk about his experiences, even until his death in July 1996, so I have always tried to find other information about this dark period in history through sources such as books, films and documentaries. I first saw Schindler's List a few years ago, but never watched it all the way through - until recently.Schindler's List revolves around a true story of Oskar Schindler who helped save the lives of more than a thousand Jews from a terrible fate. In the film, Oskar Schindler is a well-known Catholic, drinker and womaniser who is just in the whole extermination process to make pots of money at the expense of the Jews. He only cares about himself, and is more bothered about his public image than anything else. With all this behind him, he is hardly a man who thinks about...until he starts spending more time at the concentration camps. As the true horrors of the Holocaust unfold, his conscience changes dramatically until the point where he is willing to do anything he can in his power to save 1,100 Jews.Liam Neeson is absolutely amazing as Oskar Schindler. I cannot think of any other actor than him to play this part. He pulls off the role very effectively and professionally, considering the subject was so hard to pull off. The perfect counterpart to Schindler's character is that of the evil German Nazi commandant Amon Goathe. Played by the remarkable Ralph Fiennes, his character is one of pure evil. The man is demonic, heartless and totally frigid. He has no care for anyone else but himself, and has piercing eyes that will no doubt have been the subject of millions of nightmares. Continual praise is essential for Fiennes, as it must have been very hard to re-enact some of the scenes that caused so much shock and terror throughout the world.Ben Kingsley is also wonderful as Itzhak Stern, the Jewish man who works as Schindler's accountant. He doesn't have much of a large part in the film, but that all changed when he is needed to type up Oskar's list of people to save. The entire cast consists of more than 30,000 extras who give amazing performances as truly terrified Jews, giving the film a very real feel of what actually happened.The way Schindler's List is filmed in black and white is perfect. This gives the film a documentary style, which is just the way director Steven Spielberg wanted it. There are only a few colour segments, but these are put to optimum use in making the viewer take note. The most famous of these is the one where Schindler sees a little girl in a red coat running away from the Nazis. He continues to watch her escape, until he later sees her on a pile of bodies awaiting cremation at a concentration camp. He is truly shocked. Spielberg is expressing the horror of the Holocaust here by saying that not even the young and innocent are spared. There are some truly shocking and disturbing scenes in this film, but all of which are brilliant in their tried ways to describe what actually went on. There are many random killings for no apparent reason at all.This Special Edition of Schindler's List is truly one of the most essential DVD's you could ever hope to own. The movie is, in my opinion, the best I have ever had the pleasure to view. The emotion on display just blows you away, and to own the Special Edition is a great advantage for DVD fanatics. The extra features include:- Movie soundtrack- Book- Senitype from the film- Voices From The List documentary- The Shoah Foundation Story With Steven Spielberg- Cast and crew- About Oskar SchindlerOVERALL GRADE: 10/10Schindler's List is my all-time favourite film and is definitely one that all young people should see. It's different for me because my grandad went through almost everything that is in this film, and that makes me think of him as someone very heroic and courageous. While not a film you can watch again and again, Schindler's List is one that will change you and your views on the supposed idealistic world that we live in. It makes you realise how cruel society can be and how far it is possible of going if we let it. Buy this film now - you'll see things totally differently after watching it.	5.0	Finally Out On DVD - A Must Own For Everyone	2004-05-07	18	16	2

It also shows to what great detail Schindler wanted to have these Jews come work at his factory. There were some cruel parts in the movie such as people getting killed for no reason. I know that there are some bad parts, but the movie does have a good ending. If it was not for Oskar Schindler there would no be any Schindler Jews left. He saved them from getting killed. I do not recommend that children watch this movie. It is very graphic. Also you want to make sure that you allow 3 hours and 16 minutes to watch the movie. It also would not be a good movie to watch before you go to sleep.	5.0	Review	2010-04-18	2	1	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3BVRA2QL3TIOQ	carl womack	Probably one of the most disturbing films of the last century, Schindler's  List is a triumph of cinematography.  It takes you into the world of  Naziism at its  horrible height. You'll see in graphic detail, the  atrocities inflicted on the Jewish people during Adolf Hitler's reign of  terror. You'll understand why Naziism is so hated by most of the world  today and you'll wonder at how cruel man can be towards another human  being. Some could look at this movie in disbelief and say to themselves  &quot;this is hogwash, no human being could do such a thing to another  person. No one is that cruel&quot;. But, oh my friend, let me assure you  that such evils did occur on the Jewish people as well as on millions of  other people who the Nazi's considered enemies of the Third Reich. Our own  government has photographic proof of the atrocities of World War II, as  well as first hand accounts by the millions of soldiers who charged into  Nazi concentration camps and forever had their lives changed by what they  saw. A good friend of mine who served in World War II, witnessed the  horrors of a concentration camp when he and his comrades went in to free  its prisoners. He died an alcoholic, and the reason why he became one was  because of everything he had experienced while at the camp. His eyes took  in the sight of bodies in mass graves, he smelled the stench of rotting  corpses of men women and children. He told me that when he first arrived at  the camp, he waded through blood up to his ankles. He also told me he never  got over what he saw, and that many a nightmare have plagued his sleep. He  was your typical &quot;Joe&quot;, just a regular soldier from a small town  in North Carolina, a normal red blooded American, but one scarred for life  by the morbid reality of war, and the inhumanity  caused by the Nazi Party.  I don't find the scenes of terror portrayed in the movie, hard to believe.  Just pick up the morning paper or watch the evening news and you can see  for yourself how evil mankind can really be. The movie is about a  industrialist named Oskar Schindler, who employed Jews to help them escape  the horrors of the concentration camp, even going so far as to create new  jobs for them at his factory. The courage he had and the intelligence he  possessed is inspiring. With great risk to his own safety, Oskar Schindler  helped over 1000 Jews escape the grasp of a Nazi regime. This movie is not  recommended for those with weak stomachs or for viewers under age 13, as it  contains graphic violence and nudity. But I do highly recommend it to  anyone interested in studying the plight of Jews in World War II or who are  wanting to study the history of Nazi  Germany or for anyone who seeks  supreme inspiration.	5.0	Shocking, Horrifying, A Must See	2000-09-07	3	1	2

I think this movie was pretty glamourised by hollywood. I also think that the movie was too soft on children, in real life, nazis were merciless with them, they thought they were the ""nits of the lice"" which were the jews and therefore tried to exterminate them all to prevent them grwoing and producing more ""heathen race"",  children were thrown against tanks, their legs pulled apart (pulling one leg and the other apart until their body rips from the base)  hanged from a hook, experiment on, gassed, shot, tortured, diseased, and probably other stuff. This movie was powerful,  but it was really hollywoody, people who say it wasn't obviously never saw a movie that was not made by big companies in hollywood.as to the good points of the film,  the picture of this film was really splendid, you feel as though you are there.  the acting is great too, i think the most powerful acting was ralph feinnes who really explored his dark side to come up with this powerful and convicing act. the scene i think is the second-most powerful is the liquidation of the ghetto, again, hollywood censored it. probably better to cause of audiences, but they tamed it very much, nazi officers and soldiers wouldn't just shoot them, they would beat them to death with their rifles and rods, and again, smash little kids against tanks and artillery trunks ( i got this from a survivor's testimony) and a lot more.  and the conditions before the ghetto was liquidized was hollywoody, in real  life, ghettos were full of starving people and dead people all over the place, people would get killed all the time, everyday, horribly, but hollywood did not have the guts to make this a realty in the movies.the MOST powerful scene was the very ending, when survivors went(real life) to oskar schindler's grave, there was no acting here, here was peole haunted by what happened to them, real life, not by speilberg or holly wood.and the significance of the girl in the little red coat is that it is symbolising an individual, when you see a whole bunch of people getting killed, you know it's horrible, but it is just a lot of people, it is powerful and sad, but there is so much people in the same sistuation it doesn't mean as much, and the girl with red coat is walking amid this chaos, you realize these are individuals, people, who had lives, who are special, and this little girl is symbolising that individuality, and later when you see she is dead(in the second part of the movie) it really crushes you.despite all my complaints, this is a real acheivment for hollywood, good work"	5.0	A compelling and thought-provoking movie	2002-02-06	3	3	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1FHKEBRZLT7WU	Cathy Sigman	Schindler's List is a movie directed by Steven Spielberg and was the winner of seven Oscars Awards.  It is a heart wrenching true story that everyone should watch.  The movie starts out in Poland in September 1939 during a time when the German government was requiring all Jews to register with them.  This represented the first grain of sand in an hour glass for which the clock to the Jews genocide had started.  By March of 1940 all Jews had to give up their homes and relocate to the ghettos that were controlled by the SS and the German Army.  Their old homes were given to SS officers and Army Officers.  Oscar Schindler saw an opportunity in the fact that Jews could no longer own businesses.  He convinced many Jewish business people to give him their money to start a metal manufacturing company that would make products for the German war machine.  He initially used some of the money he collected from the Jews to make bribes in order to secure military contracts and eventually used profits to continue making the right people happy.  He hired over three hundred people and had to prove all his workers were essential to his business.  The Army would kill workers at random if they were deemed non-essential.  In March 1943 the German government started the process of liquidating all the ghettos and relocating Jews to either work camps or death camps.  Oscar Schindler's workforce was relocated to one of these work camps and had to make money payoffs to the camps commander.  Word started filtering through the Jewish people that the metal manufacturing company was a safe haven from possible death.  By spring of 1944 it had become known that Jews for being gassed and killed in death camps such as Auschwitz.  Oscar Schindler devised a plan to get nearly 1200 Jews relocated to Brunnlitz, a village in the Czech Republic where he lived.  Due to a clerical error the train with the females and children were sent to Auschwitz and were nearly killed but Schindler's quick thinking and power helped save them all.  They all eventually made it to their new factories and managed to make worthless munitions and purchased munitions for the military.  When the war ended in 1945, Oscar Schindler fled with his family to Germany because as a member of the Nazi party he was in danger of being arrested as a war criminal.  He later moved to his family to Argentina.  In 1958, he abandoned his family to return to Germany.  He spent the remaining years of his life spending time between Germany and Israel.  He died in 1974.How this movie relates to World Religion:  Even though one third of the world's Jewish population was killed by the Germans during World War II, a Nazi Catholic was able to save 1200 Jews. This is proof that it only takes one single person to make a difference. Oscar Schindler was accepting of the Jews, he showed them compassion, and he treated them with the love and respect that any human being deserves to be treated with.	5.0	Schindler's List- A must watch movie.	2013-10-21	0	0	0

Still cannot tell what Poland did to Germany to cause the fighting.  Seems like a form of &#34;bullying&#34;...nearly the same things our young, not so young & old people go through in school, at work  and beyond. (Just on a different scale).  Still hurts & kills heart and soul.Lots of people see that Jews lived pretty darn good back then...1930's something  & still live well today!  Maybe it's because they take care of their own, maybe not. Maybe they step on the necks of the smaller man/woman too...to make their money piles bigger.Who knows...but....when the sharing of wealth is NOT distributed properly so that the lowly white AND blue collar worker can eat decently & provide for their family....you get what we have today!  S***.Here's some statements that I have heard during my disillusioned path in this world called earth: &#34;Jews killed Christ&#34;.  Also, if the Germans had discovered the land of Africa first,(before  Britain  ...correct me if wrong there).......they, (Germans) would have made Auschwitz seem like Club Med (not quoted ...because not word for word but close).

It is also one of those unique films that actually lend itself to a ton of dvd extras, of which there are few. Sure, the film can speak for itself but it would have been great to see featurettes on the survivors of this or the Holocaust in general. I know there are other places to find such information but this dvd could have also been used as a historical document as well as a film; take a look at the 3 disc Black Hawk Down to see what I am elluding to. I know that Spielberg also had another 90 minutes that he cut from the rough cut of the film and it would have been great to either see this footage incorporated again or as an extra on disc 2 with comments on why it is so cut. I'm sure it wasn't because it was bad, but merely a time issue. Film students could really benift from such lessions. Overall, I say buy the film but let your voice be known that more would be even better.	4.0	Great movie but lacking in the extras	2003-12-21	17	13	4

Widely considered to be Spielberg's greatest film ever, this doesn't go without a reason. Every frame of Schindler's List is breathtaking, beautiful, and sometimes horrific. But if there is a perfect film out there, this would be it. This epic features amazing performances from every cast member, and unbelievable performances from from Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley. (...)The best part of Schindler's List is how you feel as if you fit into the film. It's not just a story about Schindler, but a story that actually makes the viewer feel as if they are a part of the (...)Nazi world. You feel pity for the Jewish, feel hatred for the Germans, and feel sadness for Oskar Schindler.Spielberg obviously took time to make every frame feel as important as the next one, and they are all terrific. From witnessing the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto, to the horror of the gas chambers, every part of the film is an epic. If only every film would follow Schindler's List's lead, the world would have a perfect cinematic experience.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AVCTL7NXJU1NB	CDavis	"""In the beginning of WWII, Oskar Schindler's only objective was figuring out a way to make more money. He never intended on saving the lives over a thousand Jews. ""Schindler's List"", tells the extraordinary way in which Oskar Schindler put his life on the line to save the innocent. The movie takes place in Germany and Poland. Oskar Schindler loved three thing's, women, alcohol, and money. He was a member of the Nazi party, but he was not sadistic and arrogant like many of his fellow Nazi members. In many Concentration camps, Jews were forced to perform hard labor in order to help the war effort. As a result of this Schindler was able to create a contract with the Nazi's, that allowed him to gain workers for his factory. By doing so Schindler prevented over a thousand individuals from facing a fate that so many were sent to. These peoples names were kept on a list so that Schindler could keep track of his workers. This list saved the people from being sent on transports that would have probably taken them to their death.""""The movie Schindler's List relates to world religions because it tells the story of a Christian man, who went out of his way to save over a thousand Jewish individuals. It is a prime example of how just because a person does not share the same religious beliefs as another person, it does not mean that a person lacks compassion and respect for the other. World Religions is a course that is meant to open a students eyes to different beliefs and cultures, that ways there can be a better understanding and respect for individuals who do not share the same religious background. Reguardless of what religion a person practices, that individual is still a human being. Oskar Schindler was himself a member of the Nazi party, but he did not share his party members hatred of Jews. He recognized that Jews were human being's just like him and they too deserved to live their lives free of persecution."""	5.0	Schindler's List	2013-01-27	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3NZ8KP6L3TF2U	Celly	It begins in 1939 after German forces defeat the Polish Army. In Poland, Jews are being ordered to register all family members and relocate to major cities. With World War II nearing, all Jews from Krakow and surrounding areas are forced from their homes and required to crowd into an area of only sixteen square blocks. During the Midst of everything,a German businessman named Oscar Schindler who also happens to be a member of the Nazi Party, is trying to start and run a factory with the help of an official of Krakow's Judenrat named Itzhak Stern. Since Schindler doesn't have any money, he tries to persuade Jewish businessmen to lend him some in return for a share of products that will be produced in his factory. Meanwhile, Itzhak Stern is going around recruiting Jews to work in the factory and to also prevent many from being sent to concentration camps. After the Plaszow concentration camp is completed, SS Lieutenant Amon Goeth orders troops to force Jews out of the ghetto and to kill anyone who tries to resist. Those who stay behind and hide are later found and also killed. Schindler witnesses the massacre of many Jews and becomes somewhat horrified by it and therefore tries to save as many lives as he can including those of his workers. After hearing that remaining Jews would be sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, Schindler persuades Goeth to allow him to keep his workers so that they could be relocated to a factory in his home town. This of course comes with a price, which Schindler can afford at the moment. Upon agreement, Schindler and Stern make a list of the workers and people they wanna prevent from being taken to Auschwitz. The majority of the people from Schindler;s list arrive safely at the new site but the train carrying the women accidentally makes its way to Auschwitz. In order to release the women, Schindler has to bribe the camp commander with diamonds. Most of his fortune is utilized to bribe Nazi officials in order to keep his workers alive, which results in him running out of money towards the end of the war in Europe. In 1945, Germany surrenders to the Allies and Schindler packs his bags and leaves to escape the Red Army. The next morning, the Schindler Jews receive great news that they have been liberated.	4.0	Schindler's List!	2013-03-24	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1W7JW829H45AE	"Charles M. Strnad ""Washed up jock"""	"After re-viewing this masterpiece of filmaking recently, I wanted to add just a few comments about how well Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" recreated the history of that time, and how his faithfullness to the story-telling adds to the enduring quality of this film.All too often in movie-making it seems movie directors think they need to change the real story, embellish or twist the historical facts, in order to make a movie ""entertaining"" to modern-day viewers. But the Holocaust is a daunting task- how to artfully recreate an event in history that, had it not actually happened and the events been recorded for posterity, would be too unbelievable to ever occur to the wildest of human imaginations.""Schindler's List"" is a masterpiece of blending a compelling human story with the known facts, without any ""Hollywood"" revisions.After reading several of the published books on Oskar Schindler's life, and the history of the concentration camp Plaszow ( faithfully recreated in the movie, even to the point of those scenes being filmed in a reconstructed ""camp"" very near the present-day location of the historical camp), I've been re-impressed with the movie, for it's faithfullness to history. Actual photographs of the real Kommandant Ammon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes in the film) exist showing him astride his white horse in the camp, standing on a balcony of his camp villa, casually brandishing a high-powered rifle....images that were almost exactly reproduced in the movie. An actual survivor of Plaszow who was on the movie set reportedly was even terrified by Ralph Fiennes, as he apparently so perfectly mimmicked the real Goeth. The depiction of numerous brutalities within the camp are also confirmed by eye-witness accounts of Plaszow survivors.This is one movie, about an unthinkable historical event, that remains faithful to the facts, and lets the story tell itself.And that story is timeless, and never to be forgotten."	5.0	Art  imitating/recreating life	2007-12-06	6	5	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3B9K0C0QWHZZ3	Chelsea English	Schindler's List DVD ReviewThe Holocaust refers to the period from January 30, 1933, when Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany, to May 8, 1945 (VE Day), when the war in Europe ended. During this time, Jewish people in Europe were subjected to harsh persecution that ultimately led to the murder of 6,000,000 Jews (1.5 million of these being children) and the destruction of 5,000 Jewish communities. Schindler's List is a movie that based on these true and inhuman events. This masterpiece has given people a vision into these brutal acts. During this time Oskar Schindler saved over 1000 Jews from concentration camps over the period of the Jewish Holocaust of World War II. Schindler would forge documents and provides different names, as well as work certificates for his factory so the Jewish people would be rescued from extermination, those who would be considered dispensable and be sent to the ghetto and concentration camps. Schindler's other employees recruited Jewish workers and were taught, and given instructions by the technicians on how to use the heavy machinery to manufacture soup bowls and by doing this he saved many Jewish lives. This motion picture captured and allowed us to go back to that time to witness how these people were unjustifiably tortured, and punished. It gives us an illustration to see the disgusting deeds committed in these concentration camps. The Jewish people were beaten, gassed, murdered, tortured and hung. They were fed and treated like animals. This film enlightens the viewer into the disturbing reality that was the Holocaust and illustrates how the Jewish citizens of Germany were ordered to perform unthinkable and revolting tasks. It shows the ghetto residents restricted to the confines of the small area provided, were there was no freedom and very little food or water. Schindler's List illustrates the atrocious events that people in power can execute behind closed doors.  It is movies like this that can ensure an event like the Holocaust will not go unnoticed by the public in the future. It's a must see movie and has been awarded 7 Academy Awards.

In fact, I just sat & watched it, then blubbered like a baby. If you have any interest in cinema at all, you must watch this film. I'd honestly rank it at the same level as Citizen Kane & on the scale of movies that reach your every emotion? It'd be at my #1 spot. I've seen movies that make me cry, but this is almost the only film I've watched that gets me every time.Since there's so many reviews on here that give a synopsis, I'll not bother giving one. If you haven't guessed already, I love this movie. I can't watch it all the time though- it hits your emotions that hard & you need some time for the impact of the movie to hit you.I love that this movie is predominantly in black & white- it makes it feel more in tune with the era. Plus when you see some things in the movie (the infamous girl in the red coat), it makes you notice things more, pay closer attention. It made everything more real. I also love the choice of actors. Not only does this film feature Ben Kingsley (a man who could act in anything & be fantastic), but it also had Liam Neeson in what might be the best role he'll ever do in his life.I know I'm heaping praise upon praise, but this film deserves it. I was in high school when this film came out & it was almost required watching from all of my teachers & I'm glad for it. If you don't come out of this film feeling grateful for the life you have, then you are either in an intensely horrible lifestyle or you are taking your life for granted.Even if you have to rent this, watch this film.	5.0	One of the most important films ever made!	2010-07-18	4	3	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A8MOBUTMII8OM	Christopher	It is hard to state the importance of this film, either socially or morally, but to call it anything less than that would be a mistake. Schindler's List was not the kind of film I had at first expected to come from Steven Spielberg, having grown up with E.T. and Close Encounters. To say that I was surprised by the power of this film would be a gross understatement, never before I have found myself so moved by a work of cinema. The subject matter is so disturbing, the images haunt you long after the film has ended and Spielberg's use of black and white is a stark contrast to what we expect from movies today. If there is any movie that I would recommend, any film that I would beg my friends and family to witness... it is Schindler's List. It will stand throughout the ages as a testament to the horrors of the Holocaust, and the power that we each, as individuals, have to change the world even in the face humanity's worst. With a little help, and powerful reminders like this, maybe one day we truly will make certain that such a horrific act will never again take place.	5.0	One of the most important films of any generation...	2004-02-06	4	3	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AP0DQSDFSLP4P	"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M"""	"A gripping and gut-wrenching no-holds bar account of probably the darkest chapter in human history, it is no exaggeration that watching ""Schindler's List"" in one sitting is near impossible. Keeping in mind the subject matter is neither fiction nor entertainment, its reality - the unspeakable depth of human devastation inflicted by man himself as perpetrated by Hitler's Third Reich, i.e., the Holocaust - will force the viewer to get up for air. From its ""entertainment"" perspective, the film earned Steven Spielberg a richly deserved and belated Best Director Oscar, and Oscar-nominated Liam Neeson, as German industrial Oskar Schindler trying to spare his Jewish factory workers from Hitler's death camps, is at his best in his craft. Beyond that, this film is so gripping that its glutches refuse to let us turn from its brutal reality but compels us to keep watching to remember so as to never let this human carnage occur again. In the end, we do get some redemption, some hope, because human kindness was not completely obliterated. More specifically, though, this film is a horrifying monument to the evil that man can do. But it is also a magnificent tribute to the memories of the 12 million victims who didn't make Schindler's list. This film ought to be mandtory viewing."	5.0	Perhaps the most important film ever	2002-11-08	7	6	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1ZCTRWBYIZ30S	Christopher Roberts	Schindler's List shows how one person who was a non-Jewish descent can care for those who are different.  History tells the story of the holocaust as one of the darkest part of human history.  As true as this is, the movie impacts how Oskar Schindler, a follower of the Nazi leaders, had tried to save the lives of approximately 1,100 Jews during the holocaust.  The way Schindler did this was by employing Jews to work in his factory which kept the Jews from being deported out of the city where they lived and possibly sent to a concentration camp where they possibly were murdered.  There were some scenes in the movie that showed what happened to some of the Jews who worked for Schindler.  If the Nazi army did not agree with Schindler's choices, some were shot in broad daylight in front of many others who were in the middle of working.  Schindler did not agree with this and even mentioned how killing some of his workers had delayed production and was making him lose money due to not enough work staff.As for the Jewish side of the movie, they depicted the truth as to what the Jews did in order to survive the holocaust.  Some went into hiding and some had friends who worked for the Nazi leaders that tried to help them escape.  The movie also depicts how the Jews were treated if they were found in their hiding places and deported to concentration camps.  It shows the incarnation of dead bodies in some of the camps and Schindler's reaction to this treatment.  Even though all the bad things were shown, the movie also shows how Schindler was kind to all Jews but in particular the movie depicts how he liked all women, including Jewish women.  This causes Schindler to be looked at a different way by the Nazi leaders.  Even though Schindler went through a lot of pressure, he still makes a list of 1,100 Jews near the tail end of the movie of who he wanted to be saved.  He saved them by having them go to his hometown and work at his factory.Even though Schindler may have risked his own life and possibly be looked at differently for saving Jews during the holocaust, it was something that he felt that he needed to do.  The movie is a great example of explaining that even during the worst part of human history where there was mass murdering of innocent people, there was one person who really did try to make a difference in preventing more innocent people from being victims.	5.0	Very Good Movie everyone should see	2012-04-22	3	2	1

During the exact same spot where the first DVD froze and skipped, it doesn't do it now. However, it freezes for 2-3 seconds before continuing. Is this right? Could it be because the DVD was shifting to the 2nd layer? And there's another question. Is this a double-layer, double-sided disc? Great movie, but disappointing production.

It shows Spielberg at his best, and he deserved the Best Director Oscar.This film is completely mesmerizing.  It has wonderful performances all around, especially by Liam Neeson and Ralph Finnes.  this is not the feel good movie of the year, though.  It is a horrific look at what the Nazi's did to the Jews and others who were &quot;inferior to the master race&quot;.This is a horrific movie, and very disturbing.  I could not believe how evil people can be.  This movie, though, horrific enough, puts some of the Holocaust mildly.  If you want to see it worse, go to the Holocaust Museuem in Washington, D.C.Ralph Finnes shows how evil people can be, and you are actually seduced by him.  Liam Neeson shows that in a world of evil, there is still a little bit of good.  John williams score is so breathtaking, it goes right along with the feeling of the Jews.This movie also has one of the greatest moments in movie history, in my opinion.  At the end of the movie, each one of the actual Schindler Jews puts a flower or something on his actual grave.  That made me cry.  I never cry at movies.  That was very powerful.This is not a movie to watch again and again.  It is very disturbing.  But, if you haven't seen this movie, watch it.  It is an experience everyone should have.	5.0	Absolutely Haunting!	2001-07-22	1	0	1

The setting of the movie is one of the most horrific times in history and Oskar Schindler, a German business man, ends up saving the lives of hundreds of Jews by getting them to work in his factory. Schindler is a womanizer that loves money and the finer things in life. He uses these perversions to befriend Nazis and leaders to allow the Jews to work for him. Oskar uses the cheap labor to produce cookware for the Third Reich. Schindler begins to witness the violent killings within the ghetto and wishes by the end of the movie that he had attempted to save more lives. The movie is black and white to mirror the horrendous acts of the Nazi's. The film ends with real Schindler survivors visiting graves.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2432MKKR2NFQT	Cierra	This movie starts off with a close up of hands lighting a pair of candles, followed by the Hebrew prayer. Then the movie starts with a Jewish family registering as Jews, Oskar Schindler appears in a hotel room. They didn&#8217;t show his face but they showed his expensive things such as his watch and money. He then enters into a nightclub. Once he is seated, a Nazi official gets his attention. Wanting to get on his good side, he sends a drink to the man&#8217;s table. He ends up sending expensive food and wine to a big table of Nazi&#8217;s. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils and he hires an accountant named Itzhak Stern to help him run his business. He hired a bunch of Jews. The workers were unpaid. Unfortunately, later in the story all of his Jew workers were assigned to a labor camp. This camp was ran by commandant Amon Goeth. He was an alcoholic who would periodically shoot prisoners. He wants to continue using the Jews but he begins to feel bad about what is happening to them. He soon realizes that his factory is the only thing keeping the Jews alive. He begins to demand more workers and bribes to keep his staff at work and not at the camps. He ends up losing all of his fortune but he save a lot of lives. What made Schindler change was when he seen a little girl in a red coat being forced to evacuate. That scene of violence really made him feel bad. At this point he realized there was something he needed to do to help the Jews. The theme of this story could be, the difference that one individual could make.This movie relates to world religions because it discusses the horror of holocaust that the Jews endured back then. When learning about the Jewish religion, we learned about the holocaust but this movie was just a visual explanation. Schindler&#8217;s eyes were opened up to how serious the holocaust. When his eyes were opened he seen how bad things really were, he felt that he needed to change what was going on. Even though he couldn&#8217;t change everything that was going on, he could help a lot of Jews not to get killed. Even though he ended up broke, he saved lives.	5.0	Movie Review	2014-04-13	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"I always have this image of a filmmaker who does films that may not be historically important or ""serious"" films and decides he's going to do one just to show that he can too do films that are not just fluff pieces. Look at Michael Bay. He tries to do films with heart but they end up becoming looking plastic or fake like Armageddon. Then he tries Pearl Harbor and despite the nice looks of Kate Beckinsale and the great job of ILM it's still shot in that kind of MTV style editing where it's too fast to see anything. So Spielberg after making a big hit with Jurassic Park made this next and it's really good, even if you can only watch it now and then.Oskar Schindler started out as not the savior he ended up becoming. He was a war profiteer, womanizer and member of the Nazi party living in occupated Poland. Soon the Jews are rounded up by the Germans and put into camps, overseen by Amon Goethe. First wanting to get money, he decides to ""hire"" some Jews to save them from the camps. It's only after that it's ordered that Jew bodies be exhumed and burned that he sees the horror(punctuated by a very effective red colored dress amongst the black and white of its surroundings).Shooting in black and white in a way makes the violence a little less so. Some of the Jews that get shot in the head actually have like a gushing of blood, kind of like a tamer version of Kill Bill 1 scenes. The violence is meant to show the horrors of it all without having to kind of get the audience on your side(I still hate that scene in the Pianist where an elderly man is thrown off a balcony). Also the black and white helps one scene where in order to hide, kids go inside toilets, floating around in the...well you know. Wouldn't look appealing in color right?The blonde girl in the red dress actually existed, she wrote a memoir called The Girl in the Red Coat and was named Roma Ligocka. She lived naturally but here she's one of the many bodies sent to be burned. It's there to change Schindler from a laissez-faire attitude about the Jews to something terrible. In a way, he's one of the only sane people in the place, treating Jews like people, like hosing them down with water when they're on trains and kissing a Jewish woman(who's hot by the way, just saying). Performances are great all around, notable being Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley.It's easy to understand the noticeable thin extras but you still feel slightly disappointed. You have 2 featurettes: Voices of the Past which is an hour documentary about the Jewish survivors having their recollections videotaped which is the goal of the company featured in the 2nd featurette. The Shoah Foundation videotapes and catalogues their testimonies to have a record of all that happened during the Holocaust. Well they're good in their own way, it still would've helped to have at least something on the film like the interview with Spielberg on the Close Encounters and Jaws DVD's.It's not really a film where you're going to watch it repeatedly but when you do you end up enjoying it.BTW: the man who puts the rose on the grave at the end is Liam Neeson. The actor is supposed to accompany the Jew they portrayed in the film so that's why he's putting the rose down."	5.0	One of the most important of his career	2005-08-15	2	2	0

Like Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"", I sat enthralled, mesmerized, and involved in the world of the Holocaust.  If Spielberg, Liam Neeson, and Ben Kingsley never do another thing with their lives, they have done something.  It is the best movie of that year, although ""The Piano"" was close.  As Roger Ebert wrote - ""it was an awesome experience"".  And it was just that, an experience.  You were living with these people on the screen, with the awful events in their lives, and constantly I thought ""How would I measure up?""  How much money do I squander and waste - how much I carp over little things.  Does it take some cataclysmic event to bring out the best (or worst) in us?  Where do you draw the line on ""life at any cost""?  Why is life so dear when all religions teach us the afterlife is better?  There is a grand dichotomy here.  Why was I not born a Jew in Poland?

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	"Although there are numerous books, novels, documentaries and films about the Holocaust, all shocking and deeply sad, one would have to rank Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece, Schindler's List, somewhere at the top for its alarming realism, meaningful pathos and informative message, designed to ensure that the brutal crimes of the Holocaust during WW2, will never be forgotten.Shot entirely in black and white, the decision to do so by the director, Spielberg says, he had never seen a photo or primary documentary of the Holocaust in color, thus shooting the project in mono tones seemed the logical action to take. This proved to be problematic for the cinematographer and set designer, because certain colors appear wrong under mono photography, and of course the lighting is set-up much differently to achieve particular effects. As one producer stated in an interview, ""It was like we were shooting two movies."" One would have to admit that the film felt to the viewer to be a primary historical source (a dramatic 1940's documentary) as a result of the black and white tones, but also the performances from the entire cast.Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler is a performance worthy of all the awards he received at the time. His Czechoslovakian accent is subtle and accurate, his every line spoken with deep meaning and his performance during one of the last scenes, leaving the factory with his wife, the Jewish worker's awarding him with a letter of honor and a gold ring, (made from the filling of one of the worker's) is absolutely superb and terribly moving. Oscar Schindler is a true hero during WW2, spending his fortune in order to save as many Jewish prisoner's as humanly possible from the Nazi SS.It should be noted that the violence and abject cruelty of the Holocaust for younger audiences at least, when hearing about the event, can become desensitized, flippantly dismissed as just ""something"" that happened in the past. What makes this movie so important is the violence depicted is in no way gratuitous, this sadistic criminal acts actually occurred, driving home the point that we should never forget what happened, and do everything possible to prevent the same crimes repeating. Unfortunately, genocide seems to occur across the planet in various forms to this day, (Rwanda, Bosnia, etc.) all terrible, all crimes against humanity.If you are a parent, teacher or citizen, this is the film to show that depicts the true horrors of the Holocaust, giving it tremendous meaning and has enough impact to ensure it remains in the mind, hoping that in the future this awful event is never repeated."	5.0	Lest We Forget	2007-04-23	6	4	2

I was shocked an appalled to hear that over 60% of students that graduate from high school DO NOT even know what the holocaust was! I am 15 and I feel that I am very mature for my age, and I know that I know more about life and how important it is than most of the pop/heavy metal obsessed teens of our society, who consider fine cinema any movie starring josh hartnett or mandi moore. And when reading a book on jews of the holocaust somebody asked me ""why jews wore those stars around their arms."" having no idea what the star of david was. Continuing with my fascination of the war, I was destined to see schindler's list, a compelling tragic story of hope and tragedy. This heartbreaking story pulled me in from the opening lighting of candles, to the gritty, documentary like black and white shots that we know so well. While watching this you feel like there is a weight strapped to your heart, and that weight keeps continuing to get heavier, and heavier, leaving you sick to your stomach, that people would actually do this to living, breathing human beings. Worse than that, children, babies, babies like yours who didn't know what was going on around them. Think of what it felt like when we were children, getting picked on by bullies on the playground or being lost in the grocery store. You felt terrified, and when you're that small there is nothing you can do, you just stand and wait, your little heart aching for your mother. Now think of being in a cold, muddy concentration camp, your mother and father taken away, a man standing with a rifle, swearing at you, taunting you. As a child you wouldn't know what was going on, and wouldn't know that your short, unlived life, would soon be ending.Steven Spielberg made a masterpiece here, and should be proud."	5.0	Spectacular.	2002-03-23	5	3	2
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A9AOTP6Y392X2	CookLady1	Movie Review:Schlinder's List is one of those movies that forever change the way a movie about a sensitive topic is made. Very few issues in our world's history move people like the Holocaust. This movie tackles the issue with a humanity and humility we hadn't seen before. The life of Oscar Schindler was beautifully told in this movie and it was good to know that despite the times, there were good and courageous people to stand for good.Schindler's List is a story about Oskar Schindler, who is a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis. He starts a company to make crockware and uses bribes to win a military contract. He also hires an accountant, Stern to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into the ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a very dependable labor force. For Stern, who is also a Jew,  this job could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. In 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Cmdt. Goet, a cruel man who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony for fun. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but as he observes what is happening to his employees, he begins feel bad about what is happening. He realizes that his factory is the only thing preventing his staff from being killed in the death camps. He begins to demand more workers in effort to keep more Jews alive and bribes Nazi leaders to keep Jews in his employ and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune, but saved over a thousand people from death at a concentration camp.There is no doubt that the Holocaust forever changed Jews forever. Although since the days of Abraham Jews have been persecuted, never the scope of the Holocaust. The Holocaust isn't some ancient event. People are still healing from this atrocity and the survivors and their children have to record this story for the ages. I think Schindler's list makes the record.  Over and over the Jewish people have been discriminated on simply because of their faith. And yet, through all of these horrors, so many have the strength to retain the religion for which they were prosecuted. What a story of courage, faith, and conviction!	5.0	I Wish I Could Give More Stars.....	2010-11-18	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A31Z48BHHUTB0P	CoolGramma613	Schindler's List well deserved the accolades and Oscars it received.  It is a bit Hollywood in its romanticizing of Oskar Schindler but I checked out the facts, and it is a true account of this man's humanity in a bedlam of hatred and maleficence.  Do NOT allow anyone under 18 to watch this movie no matter how mature they are.  It is stark.  It is a triumph,  It is a heartbreak.  Read about Gideon Hausner's account of his connection to the little girl in the red coat.  He was the prosecutor in the Eichman trial in Israel.  My second cousin, Yaakov Wiernik who was at Treblinka, was one of the key witnesses at the trial.  I read his and many other transcripts and came upon comments from Attorney Gideon Hausner and how this affected him when he heard about the account of the little girl in the red coat who was not a fictionalized character in Schindler's List.  She existed.  Hausner had a little girl who was the age of the one in the Schindler account which was told by one of the witnesses at the Eichman trial.  He had just bought his daughter a red coat when the trial was at that point.  He had to stop and compose himself because it touched him so deeply.  Watch for the only colored character in the entire video when you see this film.  Watch for her to reappear later on.  This film will shock and sadden you no matter how much you know about the Holocaust.  If you know nothing or next to nothing, get ready with a lot of tissues.	5.0	Incredible but Heartbreaking Account of Oskar Schindler and the Jewish People he Saved	2013-05-10	1	0	1

It's still one of the most powerful stories ever put on film, mainly because it's based on fact. Since it's Hollywood, you don't know how much of this is true but the Holocaust certainly  is and that's enough. The little details don't matter when you're talking about killing thousands of people.This movie features extremely good acting by the three leads: Liam Neson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley. Fiennes is particularly good as the Nazi villain.Neeson's scene near the conclusion when he agonizes that ""I could have done more,"" is something all of us could say and probably will some day. That sentence by him haunts me after each viewing.In addition to the moving story, the black-and-white cinematography in here is magnificent. Not many movies today are made in black-and-white and that's too bad because with today's cameras and knowledge, it can look tremendous. I hope this gets a sharp Blu-Ray treatment soon.A lot of people would not watch this movie a second time and I can't blame them. It's tough to watch. There are some brutal, harrowing scenes in here with executions, naked people being led to the gas chambers....just some very disturbing stuff.

This movie tells the story of a man named Schindler who was working for the Germans during the Holocaust. ...Schindler has a heart for the Jews and decides to help as manty Jews as he can escape from the Nazi concentration camps. In my personally opinion this movie struck me as bitter sweet, bitter in tht sometimes you had to leave the room from the scenes of death and the haunting music, and also the use of black and white to portray the movie. And sweet in that it tells the story of a man who decided to do the right thing and help people he didn't know , but he did know that what he was doing was inhumane, and against everything that he believed in.	5.0	unbeliveavle	2000-12-11	1	0	1

But watching this anew, is different this time.The ethical and moral power is so compelling, with such gifted and inspired distillation and editing.  So far ahead of anything else, today, that it poses a disturbing paradigm:  Why does our culture not show more signs of impact from this film?When I took family to see it at Ritz downtown Philadelphia 12/31/93, it was part of a phenomenon, and the news and airwaves were filled with references to 'Schindlers List'.  Watching it now, with that phenomenon and awareness long behind, it is perplexing that this corrective has faded from public and church consciousness, and is not more relevant.  The context now is this:  our theatres and cable channels have some great stuff these days.  Showtime's 'Homeland', Starz: 'Boss', the Oscar nominees 'Flight' (Denzel Washington, fantastic), 'The Master', 'Lincoln' and more. (Even if the more popular fare inevitably remains entertainment and Gladiator style violence).But 'Schindler's List' transcends everything, an unparalleled artistic achievement and moral purgative.  Watching this on Blu-Ray now, It is shocking that 20 years later, it has not grabbed greater ongoing impact and awareness.	5.0	So different to watch this 20 years later	2013-03-07	4	3	1

Schindler is a businessman trying to capitalize off the Nazi regime by purchasing manufacturing factories that make supplies for the Nazi army. Schindler uses these factories as a safe haven for the Jewish people in the Holocaust. Amon Goeth is a ruthless SS Lieutenant who is heartless, kills at his own whim, and he kills indiscriminately. Schindler has to make sacrifices in order to keep his factories going in order to keep them as a safe haven for his workers. He has to bribe Amon Goeth in order to build a sub camp for them instead of them being sent to a concentration camp. As the Jewish people are starting to be sent to concentration camps, Schindler does whatever it takes to stop his workers from being sent there. He pays Amon Goeth an outrageous bribe for each worker. A train of  female workers are accidentally sent to the Auschwitz concentration Camp. Schindler then bribes a camp commander with a large amount of diamonds. As the war comes to an end SS soldiers are ordered to kill the workers of the factory, once again Schindler intervenes in order to save his workers. Schindler is given a ring and a letter stating that he was not criminal in the eyes of his worker. He feels as though he did not do enough to save as many people as he could.Eventually after the war Amon Goeth is executed for his crimes.This film relates to World Religions because it realistically depicts all of the horrors and hardships that people in the Jewish faith had to go through. The film shows all of the brutality and needless killing of the holocaust.The film also shows some Jewish practices such as The Sabbath.The Holocaust was a major event in the Jewish faith and it affected the world as a whole.	5.0	Schindler's List world religions	2013-04-14	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A31LHED3SKLWVB	Darren	It's been over 20 years now since Spielberg's Holocaust film, and now that Amazon has it available for rental, it seemed worth seeing again.  And it very much was.  What an emotionally draining and yet satisfying experience.From the wide angle view, the movie is about the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto in 1943 and the appalling conditions the Jews (those who had not been capriciously murdered during the course of the liquidation, of course) had to suffer under in forced labor camps like Plaszow, such places being waystations for later removal to death camps like Auschwitz as the Germans started to irretrievably lose the war.  The drama of this particular aspect of the Holocaust comes from the efforts of a German businessman and war profiteer named Oskar Schindler to save as many people as he could by having them work in his factories, where they received humane treatment and protection from the murderous whimsies of the Nazi thugs who ran the labor camps.  Ultimately, as the war approached its end, Schindler literally bought over 1100 Jews from the Plaszow commandant Amon Goeth, diverting them from Auschwitz to another of his factories in Czechoslovakia, where they spent the last months of the war churning out mis-calibrated shell casings and the like.  Stanley Kubrick, commenting on Spielberg's film, said, &#34;Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't.&#34;And that's about the only real criticism one can make of this Holocaust movie, though goodness knows many have tried, particularly among academia and among (mostly European) filmmakers.  The academics have complained about the literal physical height of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes (Good vs. Evil respectively), which to them turned the movie into a titanic struggle between two opposing forces while the Jews themselves, the subjects of the battle, were physically short and sort of scurried around between their legs, or something.  Others complained that there wasn't enough rape in the movie.  Okay.  Meanwhile, some directors have made some pretty stupid comments, mostly arising, I fear, from sheer jealousy, as is definitely the case with Claude Lanzmann who directed the 9-hour documentary &#34;Shoah&#34; back in the 80s.  Listen to these sour grapes from Lanzmann:  &#34;I sincerely thought that there was a time before Shoah, and a time after Shoah, and that after Shoah certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.&#34;  What &#34;certain things&#34;, one wonders?  Sheesh.  Jean-Luc Godard, meanwhile, accused the producers of getting rich on the movie while Schindler's widow was starving to death in Argentina -- a false accusation, as it turned out.  My favorite though, was from Michael Haneke, an otherwise good director who should've kept his mouth shut:  &#34;There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well &#8211; but it was dumb.&#34;  No, I'll tell you what's dumb: an Austrian filmmaker daring to comment on the naivete of United States audiences while his countrymen cheered on their annexation by Germany and the murderous strain of anti-Semitism that followed and indeed swept through Europe in the 30s and 40s.  Haneke's comment is repugnant.  And by the way, that shower scene is the most frightening, most appalling thing I've ever seen in a movie.  When I saw it in theaters 20 years ago, I cried out in anguish when the lights in the shower-room suddenly went out.  And I wasn't the only one.  Spielberg brought home the terror to us in a visceral way.  For 2 or 3 seconds, we could -- almost -- comprehend the Holocaust.All in all, Spielberg made the right decisions, as far as I'm concerned: shooting the film in black and white, imposing a cinema-verite style using handheld cameras for about half of the shooting, using not-very-well-known actors to play the 3 principal parts.  Can you imagine Kevin Costner as Schindler?  Well, Costner had expressed interest.  Thank God we have Liam Neeson in the role -- I think his performance has been put in the shade a bit by Ralph Fiennes' flashier performance as the psychopathic commandant Goeth.  But the performance that stuck with me on this viewing was Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern, who, as Schindler himself admits near the end, is the real hero of the story.  The character, by the way, is a composite of Stern, a banker, and Goeth's personal secretary, but it's all the more a testament to the screenwriter's art and a great actor's skill that Stern feels so real to us.  Watch Kingsley as he sees the women and girls finally arrive to Schindler's arms factory after their terrifying detour to Auschwitz.  He looks out the window, watching their arrival, then slowly walks back to his desk and tries to go back to work.  We only see him from the rear, but Kingsley somehow makes us see how shattered he is from relief; the worry seems to slowly drift off his back.As for my own criticisms, they're pretty nitpicky, though hopefully not as repugnant as the sniping of Spielberg's colleagues: under the old Show-Don't-Tell rule, I think I would have omitted the whole scene where Goeth's Jewish kitchen-maid describes to Schindler Life With A Psychopath, a scene made superfluous when we see Goeth and the maid together in a follow-up scene that conveys the entirety of Embeth Davidtz' prior monologue.  I'm also not sure that the whole sequence of Goeth Being Nice For A Day really works -- here's where the screenplay seems most writerish as it tries to shoehorn an idea of inner conflict into the proceedings when ultimately there was really no need to do so.  But, look: nothing in life has any business being perfect, not even this masterpiece, which has done so much to help audiences worldwide -- not just in &#34;naive&#34; America -- get a general understanding of what the Holocaust was about.5 out of 5.  Highest recommendation.  It's an old film now, technically an &#34;antique&#34;.  If you've never seen it, see it.	5.0	A story of one light in the darkness	2014-02-17	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ADVX0P3EIKWBK	Darth Wader	"When it comes to a movie about the Holocaust, you know you are going to get something emotional.  Spielberg does a good job with this as you follow characters and their motives.  Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, a war profiteer, who slowly becomes emotionally involved with the Jewish people that he employs.  This transformation is key to the movie and is what makes it more than JUST a Holocaust film because it goes beyond the obvious.  Ben Kingsley also does a good job, playing a Jewish accountant named Stern, who also risks his life in smaller ways to help other Jews while at the same time deying odds and remaining alive.  But I think it is Ralph Fiennes that makes this movie powerful.  His depiction as Nazi commandant Amon Goeth will shock you while at the same time you feel that it is so utterly real what he is doing.  Tommy Lee Jones, who did a good job in the movie The Fugitive, SHOULD NOT have beat Fiennes for an Oscar for best supporting actor.  Fiennes will captivate you when he's on the screen, although you are not supposed to like him or his actions.  I enjoyed the black and white although I think it still would have been powerful in color.  I think there were parts that moved kind of slow, but all in all, this movie will make you think and it will open your eyes to a brutal reality of the Holocaust.  It's easy to see why Spielberg called this movie ""the most satisfying experience of my career.""  I also recommend The Pianist with Adrien Brody and the HBO series Band Of Brothers, which also deals with similar themes."	4.0	This list... is an absolute good.  The list is life.	2006-07-11	2	2	0

Scheifla ""Pratt 57"""	This movie really opened my eyes on just how horrific is was for the Jews when Hitler and his Nazi army was in the process of trying to eliminate the Jewish race. If it wasn't for Oskar Schindler, who saved over 1100 Jews from certain death, there would not be the generations of Jews today that were produced by those 1100 he saved. This movie has several scenes in it at the death camps that were portrayed so real, it feels like your right there with them. You suffer, you pray, and you try to have hope and faith that one day you will be freed. At times during the movie, in your mind, you the viewer become terrified as they were during that horrible time, not knowing for a second if you would be the next person randomly shot in the back of the head by a Nazi officer, as they would pick and chose whoever they wanted to kill, and the sick part was they did it as fun. The movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes long, but I can assure you it is well worth your time, and finally make sure to have a box of tissues near by...you'll eventually need them.	5.0	Awesome Movie	2014-01-23	0	0	0

Spielberg's direction and performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes attain that level at which matters are simply beyond improvement. One merely stands in awe.After viewing the LIST for just the second time since its debut in 1993, this reviewer can think of no more adequate response than the exhortation to buy, rent, view, and then bow silently or in prayer before the fact of evil and the potency of good.Sadly, it takes a wickedness so vile as to require its own language to occasion a work of art so noble in its conception and execution that language fails to describe it.'The LIST', as Kingsley's Yitzhak Stern says with a different intent, 'is an absolute good.'	5.0	a whole new language	2007-06-03	2	1	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	"""Schindler's List"" is one of the greatest Holocaust movies made.  Its intensity is enough to catch the audience's hearts.  However, this is also one of the saddest movies because this actually happened, and so many people died.  Steven Spielberg directed and produced this movie wonderfully.  His every drop of energy is seen in every scene.  He presents the facts about The Holocaust and Oskar Schindler exactly.  Such graphic scenes give the crew tremendous respect for showing such details that few would dare.  The movie's quality deserved all eight Oscar wins, including Best Picture 1993.The screenplay was written wonderfully.  Such quality allows the actors to portray their roles to the fullest.  The writers give every scene the brilliance and emotion, though most of them are sad.  Understandably, the emotion may make the audience cry.  The movie sets were crafted wonderfully, giving the realisms of the times.  Most of it doesn't look elaborate, but the construction took many months.  That time paid off.  The original score was composed very well.  The music follows every event exactly.  The acting was magnificant.  Liam Neeson (Oskar Schindler) and Ralph Fiennes (a Nazi troop) deserved their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.  Their research through the events and their characters are presented in every scene.  All the other actors, major and extra, are also great.Those who are sensitive to graphic nature may not want to watch this as it may upset them.  Otherwise, this is a great movie for those looking to remind themselves of certain historic times.  Behind the gore, the blood, the murders, the violence, etc. is one of the greatest movies in cinematic history and one of Steven Spielberg's best works."	5.0	One of Steven Spielberg's Best	2003-11-11	2	2	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ	David M. Lovin	"Schindler's List is the story of Oskar Schindler, who started the war looking to make as much money as possible, but by the end had spent every dollar to free as many of the Jews as he could.  The film is near perfect in every way.  It is gripping, haunting, realistic (the decision to use B/W instead of color was genius), and above all, an accurate portrayal of the times.  I once asked a Holocaust survivor what she thought the best possible documentary was about that period of history.  She thought a minute and replied ""Schindler's List"".But this is no documentary.  It's a movie and a great one.  Liam Neeson portrays Schindler as a flawed, almost tragic character.  His inhumanity during the first part of the film toward the Jews comes back to haunt him later when he has a change of heart.  Meanwhile, the most memorable character in the movie is also the one who is so cruel and heartless, it almost chills the blood.The Nazi's name is Amon Goeth and he is played by Ralph Fiennes.  No kidding, this may be one of the best acting jobs in history.  This character is the symbol of Hitler, who is not present in the film.  From standing on his terrace using Jews for target practice to viciously slapping a young Jewish girl he ""loves"", Fiennes delivers a character that allows us to see what the Nazi attitude really was.  Unlike Schindler, who transforms himself into a humanitarian, after seeing how horrible his attitude had been, Goeth never wises up, his last words in the movie being ""Heil Hitler"" before he is hanged.This is not an easy film to watch.  It is rather long, at 3 hours and 17 minutes, but the time will pass so quickly, you will hardly realize it.  There is also quite a bit of violence, some of it so horrifying that you will have nightmares for a while if you have a weak stomach.  For some reason, this film has not made it to DVD yet.  I am sure it will at some point.  For now, we are forced to endure it on tape.  At least Spielberg finally got some recognition from the academy after the shameful way they disregarded him for the Color Purple...  The movie never gets old or boring.  Without a doubt it is the best movie I have ever seen.

It is without a doubt one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen, largely because the events it depicts were so grotesquely barbaric, yet historically accurate.  The story of Oscar Schindler, who morphed from war profiteer to a rescuer of hundreds of Polish Jews destined for extinction, is told simply and calmly.  The events the film chronicles illustrate how perverse a tyrant and his minions can become unless society remains vigilant in standing against them.The cast and script execute director Steven Spielberg's vision brilliantly, and the epilogue illustrates not only the magnitude of the horror that European Jews faced under Hitler's boot, but the profound significance of Schindler's contribution to their survival.Spielberg has provided us with a history lesson that should be told and retold every few years, lest we forget the potential for tyranny in society.	5.0	A brilliant movie	2013-04-01	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	"Steven Spielberg on the holocaust.  Naturally the kids are cute even as they are diving into the excrement-filled waters of the latrine to hide from the Nazis.  Schindler, played believably by big, handsome Liam Neeson is a sweet womanizer who exploits Jewish labor in his factories and then feels guilty about it and ends up saving the lives of eleven hundred.  Ben Kingsley plays his accountant with precision and his usual subdued intensity.  We have again all the Nazi horror, in some ways worst than ever.  Here we see a lot of the random shooting of people.  The Nazis just use them for target practice or blow their brains out just to be doing something.  The cattle cars are there and the gas ovens and the Nazi psychopaths and all the rest of it, although Spielberg adds some touches like Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi who kept a Jewish woman he was interested in but couldn't love or even rape, but could only beat.  And among the guards who are herding the Jews along are a couple who smile at the kids, as though Spielberg is saying, ""here is this juxtaposition: the horror of the most degraded and inhuman acts known to humankind, but look even the monsters think the kids are cute.""We humans ought to have our face rubbed in this at least once a decade.  Still I think the actual concentration camp footage seen in, for example, Sophie's Choice (1982), to which Spielberg owes something, is as effective as anything could possibly be. When I see those films, shot by the triumphant Allied forces, I am again reminded that just concluded was the most depraved and horrific episode in human history.  Nothing we have done was worse than the holocaust, although Stalin's purging of Russian society ranks a clear second. I think the fact that Spielberg filmed the whole thing in black and white and then turned it all to color with the shot of the actual Jews (now middle-aged) that Schindler saved from the Nazis was an unconscious tribute to the power of those grainy, flickering shots of horror, part of the legacy of the twentieth century.  Perhaps it was a bit stagy, in the usual Spielberg style; however I have to say showing that one little Jewish girl's red dress (the only bit of color in the movie until the end) was a striking touch: we see her in the red dress when she hides and then when they dig up the bodies we see it again."	4.0	Lest we forget...	2004-08-25	4	4	0

A member in good standing of the Nazi party. A womanizer, a war profiteer...and ultimately a man of conscience. A man who became one of the great unsung heroes and humanitarians of the war.""Schindler's List"" chronicles Oskar Schindler's spiritual odyssey from war profiteer to humanitarian and hero. Winner of seven Academy Awards in 1993, including Best Picture, this harrowing and heart-rending film is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, and perhaps one of the finest and most important movies ever made. It depicts Schindler's ultimately successful attempt to rescue 1,100 Jews from Hitler's ""Final Solution"" by getting them to safety outside Poland.Dynamic performances abound in this beautiful movie, Especially noteworthy are Liam Neeson as the suave Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as the monstrously depraved Nazi colonel, Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley as the dignified, principled Jewish prisoner Itzhak Stern.""Schindler's List"" is definitely not light entertainment! This beautiful movie allows viewers to feel like they're actually a part of one of the darkest, most horrific periods in history. (I'm sure this is the reason the film was shot in black-and-white, with only minor ""colorized"" bits included.) The story of the Holocaust needs to be told over and over again, in hopes that future generations can understand the horrors perpetrated on an entire race of people and prevent future occurrences. ""Schindler's List"" is perhaps one of the best and most effective vehicles for telling that story I've ever experienced."	5.0	A cinematic masterpiece!	2004-04-12	5	4	1

Some good films have arrived since then but I think there is no doubt there's hasn't been anything else better.It's plain simple. And watch out what has taken XXI century. Has any other film moved you or made you think? Soundtrack, photography, art direction and sound are of the highest quality ever.You will say Neeson and all actors don't make an excellent play. But is it a matter of actors? Who cares about films like Training Day or Leaving Las Vegas? And their actors won an Oscar...&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is by far the best film of 90's. Only &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a bit closer than other mediocre films. Keep waiting for something good...	5.0	Waiting for something better?	2004-02-19	13	5	8

Schindler's List is also a list, produced by Oskar Schindler, of 1100 Jews whose lives were saved from a horrific death in a concentration camp at Auschwitz. The film begins in September of 1939. Jews were ordered to register their families and move to a walled 16 block ghetto of Krakow. Jews were forced from their homes. Families were separated. They were not allowed to own homes or any item of value.Schindler opened a cookware factory and employed men, women, and children from the ghetto to work for him. Schindler's accountant Stern helps him with the financial and human resource aspects of his business. The business is successful and Schindler becomes a wealthy man until Amon Goeth, an SS lieutenant, gives word to his men the ghetto must destroyed. People are brutally hunted down and murdered while Schindler watches. The survivors are taken back to a camp with Goeth as the overseer.Schindler, a German member of the Nazi party, pays for all of his workers freedom from an inevitable death. He opens a new factory in his hometown and goes broke keeping the business going. When World War II is over, Schindler flees the country and urges his workers to find what is left of their families. Liam Neeson, as Oskar Schindler, gives an outstanding performance in one of the last scenes of the movie. Schindler is given a gold ring by his workers in thanks. He weeps at the thought of not saving more people and spending too much money on luxuries.This movie shows how Jewish people were beaten and murdered people only because of religion. Judaism is a world religion practiced by millions. There are several references in the movie regarding customs practiced. Near the end Schindler asked a factory worker and rabbi if he forgot to prepare for the Sabbath. The Sabbath begins sundown Friday evening. The men of the factory gathered around a table of lit candles. The movie also begins with a Jewish family lighting the candles in celebration of the Shabbat.The ring given to Schindler was engraved with a quote from the Talmud: ""He who saves one life saves the world entire"". This sentiment brought Schindler to tears. He felt as though he could have done more, but 6,000 descendents came from the 1,100 Schindler saved.Schindler's List is a dark and disturbing example of one of the worst times in history. This film is thought provoking and can be the source of discussion about violence and respect of religious differences."	5.0	Schindler's List	2013-11-02	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A10M6TWBJ72QMV	Diego Garcia	"(...) First of all: Schindler's List is a very very great movie, not about the history itself, but the score, visual effects, etc. The reason from a black-and-white movie is from ""smooth"" all the blood scenes, because Steven did not want a bloody movie at all. And the movie has many cenes with people being executed. Second, Steven already thinked about doing this movie since 1982 (when universal pictures bought the rights from Thomas Keneally's book). But he didn't considered yourself growned enough as director to make a movie such like this. But, in 1992, shocked with the ethnic clean-up on Bosnia and seeing the Holocaust being forgotten by the coletive memory, he decided to do this movie. Schindler's List is not a ""marketing"" movie, is a movie made from people REMEMBER, because if the Holocaust will be forgot, this will be happen again. Because there isn't many visual archives when the concetration camps are in activity. All the brutal activies made by those (...) nazis was discovered after the war is over. And many people even believed that the Holocaust actually happened. And movies like this keep the public memory alives. Of course, I have to agree that the movie wasn't realistic enough, Steven completly forgot about the christians and others ""minories"" genocide. Besides, there isn't one scene with jews fighting back against the nazis on the ghettos. In the movie, the victims are very very passive, but even with those details, the movie is wonderfull. From the American History guy: what the hell are u think? Do you really think the each nation have to learn the history about their own nations only, and that's it? If everybody will think like you, we're gonna have a very stupid generation on the next years... I'm not saying that American History is not important, but try to expand your horizonts a little bit, darling."	5.0	Sorry for any English mistakes, but...	2004-06-27	6	2	4

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stands alone in the hall of Holocaust movies that try to depict the true horror of Nazi aggression against the Jews. The plot, jumpy yet fluid, shows its audience the lives of many of  the Jews affected by the Holocaust who later are helped out by the famous  Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson. Each piece of this film is  something new, something previously unknown to many viewers. Scenes taking  place in the concentration camps are bloody, gruesome, and yet they show  the true horror and terrifying reality of what really happened in Germany  during the 1930's. Liam Neeson's portrayal of Schindler is magnificent, his  demeanor changing many times from giddy to serious to heart-broken. Ralph  Fiennes plays Amon Goeth, one of the cruelest Nazi officers known in  history. Fiennes plays Goeth with cool precision, as a man who had no  problem shooting someone in the back from his villa balcony. A moving  tapestry of strength, death, life, and the will to live, Schindler's List  is a movie for those who need to be touched.	5.0	History at its most horrifying.	2000-03-24	14	11	3

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	"While watching Steven Spielberg's masterpiece I am faced with a most curious dichotomy:  I enjoy watching this film; I am repulsed watching this film.  Which, I suppose, is as it should be; SCHINDLER'S LIST depicts humanity at its best--inhumanity at its worst.  Spielberg wanted to stress authenticity when he made this film, and he didn't cut any corners.  Summary, wanton executions, beatings, herding scores of naked men and women before stern Nazi physicians, hiding in human waste--this is easily one of the most disturbing movies ever.  Yet the naked brutality is essential in the telling of this story of the Holocaust; only by showing the depths of pain and despair can Oskar Schindler's selfless goodness come to the forefront.When we first meet Schindler (Liam Neeson, who is magnificent), he is a self-confident, playboy profiteer looking to make some serious money manufacturing goods for the German army in Poland.  Schindler is gregarious, generous, greedy, even a tad corrupt; he has no trouble making fast friends with the Nazi leadership and getting his factory off and running.  Hiring an astute Jewish accountant (Ben Kingsley), Oskar is making more money than even he anticipated.But then the Nazi extermination progroms are implemented.  The Jewish ghetto is cleaned out, its population shipped to concentration camps.  And we see Oskar Schindler begin to transform, from a gregarious womanizer to a humanitarian horrified by what he sees happening before his very eyes.  By bribing the Nazi officials at a nearby camp, he is able to employ hundreds of Jewish workers, thereby giving them at least a respite from the daily horrors of the camp.  And finally, upon learning the camp will be emptied and its prisoners taken to the gas chambers of Auschwitz, he and Kingsley's character comprise a list of 1,100 names--people he will take with him to his new plant in Czechoslovakia. . .people who will escape certain death.  He spends every last dime he has amassed to ""buy"" these workers, then laments during this film's moving climax, ""I should have saved more.""This is one incredible film; the story is extraordinary, the acting phenomenal.  I was the most impressed by Ralph Fiennes playing the commandant of the Nazi camp sending workers to Schindler's factory.  With a cold, almost listless, expression, Fiennes is brutal, diabolical--chilling.  It's an unforgettable role for an unforgettable movie; SCHINDLER'S LIST is one of the all-time greats, and most deserving of all its awards and accolades.--D.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A26D5IRV2OLU4B	D. Munro	"This is, without a doubt, the best Holocaust film made to date.  Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes give realism and breath to the people they portray, representing three very different men: charming businessman Oskar Schindler, Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern, and sadistic Nazi Commandant Amon Goeth, respectively.The movie begins in color, fading to black and white.  If it seems odd that a modern movie would be in black and white, sit back and savor it -- it only makes it better.  Spielberg does this deliberately, since all of the surviving Holocaust pictures and footage are in black and white. Schindler (Neeson) arrives in Krakow, Poland with one goal -- to make money. He's a charming man who makes friends easily, wines and dines the right people to get what he wants ... especially if it's a woman.  If somebody does him a favor, he tells them he's grateful -- showing his gratitude with fine gifts to keep his new ally on his side.  It doesn't hurt that he now has a large home in Krakow (stripped away from a wealthy Jewish family who were forced to move into the ghetto).Every successful businessman needs a brilliant accountant.  Schindler immediately seeks out a reputable Jewish accountant by the name of Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), aware of his past managing successful businesses.  However, Stern is not impressed with Schindler and suspicious of Schindler's motives.  ""The worse things get, the better you'll do,"" he tells Schindler.  Nonetheless, Stern agrees and becomes Schindler's accountant and business manager.  Ben Kingsley, always an amazing actor, plays the man very well.  Stern convinces his employer to hire Jewish workers from inside the ghetto, saving many lives in the process.  He becomes Schindler's conscience without being preachy.  In one scene, Schindler is ""entertaining"" a woman in his bedroom when there is a knock on the door.  Schindler is angry, believing it is Stern who is disturbing him.  Except it isn't -- Stern has been taken away by the Nazis and put on a train headed to a concentration  camp.  Schindler races to the train station, endures the arrogance of Nazi officers who are less than accomidating, and manages to pull Stern from the train and save him from a no-doubt horrible fate.  His concern at this point is strictly monetary, since Stern runs the business.Schindler witnesses the horrible, bloody liquidation of the ghetto.  The residents of the ghetto who aren't sent away to concentration  camps are relocated to Plaszow, a labor camp under the command of Amon Goeth, a Nazi commandant who takes delight in using Jewish prisoners as target practice.  Ralph Fiennes shows himself a wonderful actor here, even before he ever became Harry Potter's Voldemort.  The sight of Fiennes in this role is one that makes the viewer shudder with disgust -- the real man was evil, and Fiennes's eyes are cold, unfeeling in this role.  Unfortunately, in order to protect his workers, Schindler must work with Goeth and stroke the man's ego with a faux friendship, while providing Goeth with large amounts of money.  He does this in order to protect his workers.The Schindler-Stern friendship is, in my opinion, the most important relationship in the movie.  It is the foundation for everything, the List included.  While Stern has been relocated to Plaszow, Schindler finds reasons to visit him, to check on him and bring him gifts that Stern can trade for survival.  When Goeth announces that the camp is to be shut down, that the prisoners are going to Auschwitz (Stern included), he is prompted to immediate action -- he and Stern gather in the office and the List is created.  ""The List is life,"" Stern says, ""And all around its margins lies the gulf.""Schindler relocates his 1,100 employees to Czechoslavakia, where they can breathe a sigh of relief in a safe location.  It is a haven for his workers, where nobody fears a summary execution -- Schindler doesn't even allow the soldiers inside the factory.  Schindler's munitions factory is, in fact, a sham ... the workers create nothing that will actually work, but live in safety with food and a warm place to sleep every night.  Stern is the accountant, keeping track of the money and which Nazi officials need to be bribed to maintain the utopian status quo.The best scene, for me, is the scene where Schindler and Stern shake hands.  There's so much to say, but neither knows what exactly to say.  Stern presents Schindler with a gift (a ring, created from golden fillings) with an inscription -- ""He who saves one life saves the world entire.""  Schindler puts the ring on his finger and then extends his hand to his friend.  Stern takes it, and Schindler covers Stern's hand with his own.  A wonderful scene, showing just how far their friendship had come.The movie not only tells Schindler's story, but also some of the real people on the List, of what they endured before being rescued by Schindler.  There is some violence, but used only to depict the realism of Nazi brutality.  Spielberg creates a moving, wonderful tribute to the real Oskar Schindler in the epilogue and rounds out this movie quite nicely. Definitely an essential movie and one I'm happy I have in my collection."	5.0	"""He Who Saves One Life Saves the World Entire."""	2009-03-19	4	3	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A39C4Z0TBR2FYM	Donald Wilson	The movie, Schindler's List, outlines the struggles experienced by both Jews and non-Jews during the time of the Holocaust. Schindler begins with the excitement of how much money he is going to make off of the sufferings of the Jews. Virtually free labor means extreme profits for him. He becomes so successful, due in large part, to his hired Jewish bookkeeper. Throughout the movie, it is clear he realizes the value his bookkeeper has to his success. He treats him well, considering the treatment of the Jews during that time. As times grew worse for the Jews and they were treated more and more barbaric, Schindler mourns the temporary loss of profits. More than that, there is a sense that he is mourning for the people, knowing that what was happening was wrong. When the Jews were shipped out in train cars, he is shown spraying water into the cars in an attempt to somewhat relieve their thirst and suffering. Schindler was a businessman by all accounts, but not evil, as some of the others in power exhibited in relation to the barbaric treatment of the Jews. When it became evident that the Jews were going to be shipped off and killed, Schindler made a list of those he wanted to purchase in an attempt to save their lives. As he is getting into his car to flee the area as he was guilty of war-related crimes, his emotions overcame him. He realizes he could have purchased more people with the money he had invested in his car and any other valuables he had. The Holocaust affected the Jews tremendously, but it also affected non-Jews in emotional ways, as evident by the portrayal of Oskar Schindler.Schindler's List portrays religious persecution that has happened in the world for many centuries. It has an important part in the study of World Religions because it documents the extreme suffering of people simply because of their beliefs. On our day and time, we just don't see this type of persecution based on one's religion or race. Sure, there are people ridiculed and judged for their beliefs and practices, but nothing to the extent of the Holocaust. It is extremely important for these types of horrific tragedies to stay in the studies of religion as a reminder of the freedoms we experience today. It can also serve as an encouragement to step in, when possible, to help others in our society. Religion is very different today than it was during the time of the Holocaust. Without the studies of these types of incidents, society cannot truly grasp what it means to have freedom from religious persecution.	5.0	World Religion and the Holocaust	2013-04-10	0	0	0

Sudetenlander,Oskar Schindler goes to  Poland hot on the heels of the German Army with the ambition to make more  money than his father. He cultivates the powers that be, the army, SS,  nazis bureaucrats, charming them with gifts and parties. He sets up a  factory making enamel ware for the German army. Meanwhile the jews of  Krakow are put into the ghetto there and stripped of their human rights.  Forced to work for the nazis regime, life goes on for people as normally as  it can. People do business, fall in love, struggle on, hoping for better.  Along comes Amon Goeth, SS major and cold hearted murderer, in a show  stealing performance by Ralph Fiennes, with the plan to liquidate the jews  of Krakow. In one night Goeth sets out to make six centuries of the history  of jews in Krakow just a rumour. Schindler feels protective towards his  workers and seeks to aid them wherever he can and survive the evil nazis  system. He eventually decides to save as many as he can in a remarkable  application of market forces. Schindlers vitality in life and love swells  through this film as he consorts with the nazis regieme. Liam Neeson is  delivers a career best performance as Schindler.The film, evoking the  deep and long history of the jewish people and sensuality of life, is a  startling and disturbing narration which ends with liberation. A remarkable  film of great strength, of horror set beside the fecundity of life. The  striking imagery of Schindler and his beautiful female companion lying  naked in bed while some of the worst evil in the history of mankind goes on  around them in the city of Krakow will resonate long after the film ends.	5.0	sensual depiction of a holocaust story	2000-07-12	6	5	1

Pawl ""Dani"""	"SCHINDLER'S LIST is simply a marvelous example from the exceptional body of work from filmmaker Stephen Speilberg.  Set during the height of Nazi occupation in Europe, this take a sobering look at the work of Oskar Schindler [Liam Neeson] and his astonishing transfomation from self-centered lothario to humanitarian.  Based on a true story, the work of Oskar Schindler, a gentile who worked as an advocate for Jews by offering them work in his crockery factory, as well as offering them refuge, all the while under the nose of a bloodthirsty Nazi [Ralph Fiennes], is portrayed vividly in this 1993 production.Initially, Speilberg didn't intend for this film to be anywhere close to the success that it became.  SCHINDLER'S LIST went on to win numerous well-earned Academy Awards, critical acclaim, as well as recognition for Stephen Speilberg, as a director and a visionary artist.  The acting is beautiful, the black-and-white shots make a bold and chilling impression on the viewer, as well as the minimal use of color (with the exception of the infamous ""little girl in the red coat""--you'll have to view the film to fully understand the significance and symbolism of this recurring character).  This is a very important story that recounts a very painful chapter from our past, as human beings, at a time where seemingly ""civilized"" individuals senselessly brutalized and murdered tens of thousands of Jews, Gypsies, and other scapegoats in the name of the Third Reich and fascist violence.  Don't miss this one.  It truly is a remarkable example of exemplary cinematic storytelling."	5.0	one of the best films of Stephen Speilberg's career......	2007-09-04	4	3	1

Spielberg recreates this true life horror all too realistically. Filming in Black and White, authentic locations and sets only adds to the realism. Neesom, Kingsley and Fiennes are unforgettable, but there isn't a performance in this film that doesn't ring true.What makes this film so much more that a film about the Holocaust is that it center's around one man who grows from War Profiteer to savior . It's both spellbinding and engrossing, Neesom is just amazing as Oskar Schindler who schmooze's his way into the Nazi's ""good graces"". Neesom deserves a lot of credit for his performance and it alone could carry this film, but it doesn't end there, Kingsley (who plays Istak Stern Schindler's Jewish account) is just as captivating, who rescues many Jews who would surely have been killed because of age or handicaps. If that isn't enough we get yet another fantastic performance from Ralph Fiennes who plays the sadistic camp commandant.The film runs 3 hours and 15 minutes, but doesn't seem nearly that long. There isn't a minute that is wasted. It's completely mesmerizing from start to finishThe 20th Anniversary Blu Ray looks beautiful, one of the best transfers I've seen. The film looks flawless showing just the right amount of grain. Because of the films' length there are no bonus features on the BR disc, but the 2 discs DVD's house one half of the film each and the features which are very interesting and thorough.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AJPIV68PR3KZ7	E. Cullmann	"Schindler's List is a 1993 film about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. The film was directed by Steven Spielberg, and based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS)-officer Amon G&ouml;th, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.The film begins in 1939 with the German-initiated relocation of Polish Jews from surrounding areas to the Krak&oacute;w Ghetto shortly after the beginning of World War II. Meanwhile, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), an ethnic German businessman from Moravia, arrives in the city in hopes of making his fortune as a war profiteer. Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, lavishes bribes upon the Wehrmacht and SS officials in charge of procurement. Sponsored by the military, Schindler acquires a factory for the production of army mess kits. Not knowing much about how to properly run such an enterprise, he gains a close collaborator in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), an official of Krakow's Judenrat (Jewish Council) who has contacts with the Jewish business community and the black marketers inside the Ghetto. The Jewish businessmen lend Schindler the money for the factory in return for a small share of products produced. Opening the factory, Schindler pleases the Nazis and enjoys his newfound wealth and status as ""Herr Direktor"", while Stern handles all the administration. Schindler hires Jewish Poles instead of Catholic Poles because they cost less (the workers themselves get nothing; the wages are paid to the SS). Workers in Schindler's factory are allowed outside the ghetto, and Stern falsifies documents to ensure that as many people as possible are deemed ""essential"" to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps, or being killed. SS-Lieutenant (Untersturmf&uuml;hrer) Amon G&ouml;th (Ralph Fiennes) arrives in Krak&oacute;w to oversee construction of the new P'asz&oacute;w concentration camp. Once the camp is completed, he orders the final liquidation of the ghetto and Operation Reinhard in Krak&oacute;w begins, with hundreds of troops emptying the cramped rooms and arbitrarily murdering anyone who protests or appears uncooperative, elderly or infirm. Schindler, watching the massacre from the hills overlooking the area with his mistress, is profoundly affected. He nevertheless is careful to befriend Goeth and, through Stern's attention to bribery, Schindler continues to enjoy SS support and protection. During this time, Schindler bribes Goeth into allowing him to build a sub-camp for his workers, so that he can keep his factory running smoothly and protect them from being randomly executed. As time passes, Schindler acts on information provided by Stern to try and save as many lives as he can. As the war shifts, Goeth receives orders from Berlin commanding him to exhume and destroy the remains of every Jew murdered in the Krak&oacute;w Ghetto, dismantle P'asz&oacute;w, and ship the remaining Jews--including Schindler's workers--to the Auschwitz concentration camp.At first, Schindler prepares to leave Krak&oacute;w with his fortune. He finds himself unable to do so, however, and prevails upon Goeth to allow him to keep his workers so that he can move them to a factory in his old home of Zwittau-Brinnlitz, in Moravia away from the Final Solution, now fully underway in occupied Poland. Goeth eventually acquiesces, but charges a massive bribe for each worker. Schindler and Stern assemble a list of workers who are to be kept off the trains to Auschwitz.""Schindler's List"" comprises these ""skilled"" inmates, and for many of those in P'asz&oacute;w camp, being included means the difference between life and death. Almost all of the people on Schindler's list arrive safely at the new site. The train carrying the Jewish women is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz. The women are taken to what they believe to be the gas chambers; they then weep with joy and immense relief when water falls from the showers. The day after, the women are shown waiting in line for work and being inspected by the camp physician, Dr. Josef Mengele. In the meantime, Schindler rushes immediately to Auschwitz. Intending to rescue all the women, he bribes the camp commander, Rudolf H&ouml;&szlig;, with a cache of diamonds in exchange for releasing the women to Brinnlitz. However, a last minute problem arises just when all the women are boarding the train. Several SS officers attempt to hold back the children and prevent them from leaving. Schindler, however, insists that he needs their hands to polish the narrow insides of artillery shells. As a result, the children are released. Once the women arrive in Zwittau-Brinnlitz, Schindler institutes firm controls on the SS guards assigned to the factory, forbidding them to enter the production areas. He permits and encourages the Jews to observe the Sabbath. In order to keep his factory workers alive, he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shells from other companies, meaning he never actually produces working shells for the seven months his factory is in business. Later, he surprises his wife while she is in the village church during mass, and tells her that she will now be the only woman in his life, a concession he had refused to grant previously. She goes with him to the factory to assist him. He runs out of money just as the Wehrmacht surrenders, ending the war in Europe.As a Nazi Party member and a self-described ""profiteer of slave labour"", in 1945, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army. Although the SS guards have been ordered to liquidate the Jews of Brinnlitz, Schindler persuades them to return to their families as men, not murderers. In the aftermath, he packs a car in the night and bids farewell to his workers. They give him a letter explaining he is not a criminal to them, together with a ring secretly made from a worker's gold dental bridge and engraved with a Talmudic quotation, ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire."" Schindler is touched but deeply ashamed, feeling he could have done more to save many more lives, such as selling his car, and selling his Golden Party Badge could have saved one more. Weeping, he considers how many more lives he could have saved as he leaves with his wife during the night.The Schindler Jews, having slept outside the factory gates through the night, are awakened by sunlight the next morning. A Soviet dragoon arrives and announces to the Jews that they have been liberated by the Red Army. The Jews walk to a nearby town in search of food.After a few scenes depicting post-war events and locations, such as the execution of Amon Goeth by hanging for war crimes and a brief summary of what eventually happened to Schindler in his later years, the film returns to the Jews walking to the nearby town. As they walk abreast, the black-and-white frame changes to one in color of present-day Schindler Jews at Schindler's grave site in Jerusalem (where he wanted to be interred). The film ends by showing a procession of now-elderly Jews who worked in Schindler's factory, each of whom reverently sets a stone on his grave--a traditional Jewish custom denoting deep gratitude or thanks to the deceased. The actors portraying the major characters walk hand-in-hand with the people they portrayed, placing their stones as they pass. (Ben Kingsley is accompanied by the widow of Itzhak Stern, who died in 1969.) The audience learns that, at the time of the film's release, there were fewer than 4,000 Jews left alive in Poland, but more than 6,000 descendants of the Schindler Jews throughout the world. In the final scene, Liam Neeson (although his face is not visible) places a pair of roses on the grave and stands contemplatively over it.The film concludes with a statement, ""In memory of the more than six million Jews murdered""; the closing credits begin with a view of a road paved with headstones culled from Jewish cemeteries during the war (as depicted in the film), before fading to black.  The impact of the Holocaust was that millions of Jews lost their lives during World War 2 and it is an import story to remember. So that something like this never happens again.  Anti-Semitism caused this to happen and  one important element of the Holocaust was that the Nazi genocidal machine was aimed not only at the destruction of the European Jewish Community, but also at the Jewish seed itself. It was a war not only against the Jews racial existence, but also against the Jewish procreative potential. The very number of individuals imprisoned and murdered in the concentration camp network challenges one's ability to comprehend the enormity of the suffering. The repeated exterminations that had already begun in the ghettos, continued on arrival at the camps and were repeated again and again at every medical inspection. Anyone with any sign of physical disease was eliminated. The suffering and deprivation were enormous. Mortality after liberation from Bergen-Belsen was so great that many of the physically weak died almost immediately after the liberation they had longed for. At war's end, tens of thousands of survivors found themselves in Displaced Persons (DP) Camps, waiting to immigrate to Israel (then called Palestine). These survivors included Jews from Germany, Austria, Italy, and in particular, Poland, where they no longer found a viable Jewish community, and moreover, the Jews who had survived were still the objects of hate and murder by Polish nationalists. The survivors of the Holocaust were condemned to wait many times for long months and sometimes even years until they were able to immigrate to Israel. Their determination to reach that land and rebuild a homeland was a major contribution of the survivors to the eventual independence of Israel and to the renewal of Jewish life in the Jewish State."	5.0	Schindler's List	2012-04-22	3	2	1

The rest of the cast is also superb and well-directed, with a solid script, excellent camera work; the movie actually doesn't feel quite as long as it really is.The last ten minutes is the only time the ""old"" Spielberg rears his ugly head again as he has Neeson breaking down in tears and rebuking himself for not saving even more Jews than he did (1100 roughly).  Let's hope that Neeson got a special bonus for having to act out such an embarassingly silly scene.  Luckily, this vintage Spielberg maudlin-excess is counterbalanced by the dark irony of a Russian soldier riding up to the newly freed Jews and proclaiming, ""Congratulations, you have just been liberated by the Soviet Army!""  (That scene takes place in Czechoslovakia and when I first saw the film in a Prague cinema in 1994, the whole audience couldn't stop laughing.)There is of course a subtle political agenda, too: asked where they should go now, the same Russian soldier answers, ""Don't go east, they hate you there.  But don't go west.  If I were you, I wouldn't go west, either.""  A nice justification for the U.N.-decreed founding of the state of Israel in 1948 at the expense of oh, just a few million indigenous Arabs...Otherwise, ""Schindler's List"" is a worthy film and nice history lesson."	4.0	Spielberg finally grows up, warts and all	2003-01-01	18	3	15

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A9L6L5H9BPEBO	Edwin C. Pauzer	"Few films convey such raw power, performance, dignity, and reverence as ""Schindler's List."" It is one of those films that you will move you to tears no matter how many times you see it. I saw it again last night for the umpteenth time not wanting to miss a single scene.This is Liam Neeson's break-out role playing Oskar Schindler, a German businessman and manufacturer who profited from making enamelware in Krokaw, Poland during the Nazi occupation. Schindler is a fast-living, fun-loving man who knows how to schmooze Nazi psychopaths into increasing his contracts and wealth. His interest is in making money, not saving Jews. His accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) informs him that he can make even more using Jewish slave labor instead of Polish nationals. On a country horeseback ride he witnesses the Nazi massacre in the Krakow ghetto where the flash of machinegun fire can be seen threw the darkened windows, and children murdered in the streets below or seeing their parents murdered. (The girl in the red coat heightens the drama). This is the beginning of his metamorphosis from millionnaire to humanitarian.  He begins to scheme, charm, and bribe his way to protecting his Jewish workers who would forever be known as ShindlerJuden (Schindler's Jews). Jews quickly realize that working for Herr Director is their safest confine in a world gone mad with fiendish evil and barbaric slaughter. In one of the greatest ironies of war, a Nazi begins saving Jews.He employs more than 1100 of them. He lists children and the infirm as valuable machinists necessary to the war effort. When the Russians begin to overrun Poland, he demands that his workers be moved to his new project of producing munitions to the safer location in western Czechoslovakia. When the women and children are diverted to Auschwitz, an indignant Schindler shows up and demands their release to his custody. He informs the guards at the new plant that the Jews are not to be shot or even touched.Amon G&ouml;th is simply a murderous Nazi SS officer in charge of the Jewish ghetto and konzentrationlage at Plasz&oacute;w. His sport is shooting his rifle from the balcony of his villa onto the inhabitants in the camp below. Their offense might be their repose, their countenance, or simply moving too slowly for his mood. Played by Ralph Fiennes, his cold eyes, (once mild and suddenly cold-blooded), and voice can give you chills of dread. His explosion of murderous hatred for Jews is as unpredictable as his attraction for his Jewish maid. Schindler's influences G&ouml;th by thought and Reichsmarks to save lives in a relationship that is anything but symbiotic.Ben Kingley's performance is equally superb. His wariness of Schindler's gregariousness is evident at the beginning when he doesn't accept a drink offered by his employer. His trust is evident when he realizes that the man is his savior, and says, ""I'll think I'll have that drink,"" later in the story.The most touching scenes come near its conclusion when he tells his worried accountant that he will not be paid by the reich because the munitions are faulty. He tells Itzhak Stern that he will be very unhappy if any of them work. Schindler's Nazi affiliation is now nothing more than the pin her wears in his lapel. But his real humanity comes through in a simple dialogue when he questions a worker/rabbi. ""The sun is going down, isn't it?"" he queries. ""What day is it, Friday?"" ""Shouldn't you be preparing for the Sabbath?""If this black-and-white movie was in overdrive for performance and power, it goes into hyperdrive for its emotional impact. The gift and the letter to Schindler, a letter signed by everyone attesting to his righteousness is gut-wrenching especially with Schindler's guilt that he failed to do more. The final scene, and the only one in color, is the survivors following Jewish tradition of reverence by placing stones on the grave of Oskar Schindler at Mt. Zion Christian cemetery in the land where he wanted to be buried--Israel. The audience cannot be anything but moved watching them being escorted by the actors who played them, and the sound of the theme played by Itzhak Perlman who plays the violin like no one ever thought it could be played. The theme song is simple but beautiful.The success that came so easy to Schindler in life, eluded him in peace.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A4FAPQKQQLJY1	Elite	"Every so often a movie comes along that really gets to you. It's emotional, informative, and entertaining at the same time. ""Schindler's List"" is the story of Oskar Schindler. A nazi businessman who ends up saving the lives of thousands of Jews during WWII. If you are a movie fan at all, you have probably seen this movie before, if not multiple times. So, I won't re-tell the movie, but if you haven't seen it.....go purchase this DVD right now.This movie is amazing. It's so brutely honest and engaging that I can't even explain it. I am not Jewish, but I can only imagine how moving this movie would be if I were. It made me laugh, cry, and almost sick during the 3hr. time frame. To see what the Nazi's would do to the Jews during the holocaust was just insane. I couldn't imagine human beings doing that to other human beings, but Spielberg puts it on film for us to see. Like I said, this film is not only entertaining....it's educational. It teaches you how evil the human race can be and I obviously hope nothing like the holocaust ever happens again.I think this maybe Spielberg's best work. The film looks great, sounds great, and I have already raved about the movie itself. It's shot in black and white, which I think was an excellent choice. I would definately rank this up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"" as Spielberg's best two movies. Go get this flick.Special Features: Not a ton of stuff here, but what is here is really good. There is a documentary (called ""Voices From The List) about the survivors of the holocaust. It is almost exclusively made-up of interviews with the survivors. Very good and moving stuff. Then there is the ""Behind The Shoah Foundation with Steven Spielberg"" featurette. The last feature is featurette about Oskar Schindler. Like I said, not a ton of supplements, but what's here is very good."	5.0	Maybe Spielberg's finest........	2004-11-03	2	2	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2KB14WCZ1DVE3	elvistcob@lvcm.com	"My last book was Pat Conroy's ""Beach Music"".  That work finds another angle to show the insanity of the Holocaust (the despised yet pitiful ""Judenrat"", mildly covered in this film) when one might have thought there was nothing more new to cover.  Coincidently this weekend I caught this movie, so at this point I'm pretty sober about the misery humans are capable of inflicting upon one another.The major plot, of course, involves the amazing feat of saving approximately 1,000 Jews from death by the unlikliest of sources:  the Catholic, womanizing, profiteering businessman Oscar Schindler.  The movie indeed does hint that profit may have been the original motive in using cheap labor to finally be a ""success"" in business.  But there is no doubt that genuine human feelings were involved when his entire fortune is used to pull one of history's great con jobs on one of history's most ruthless regimes (sadly, there were others just as bad).We also not only see the ghastly and heartbreaking scenes of physical depravity, but the movie goes even further.  Not only was this a plan by Germany to kill people, it was a campaign to humiliate and degrade them every step of the way to their deaths.  Through murder, intimidation, and propaganda, a band of thugs took over a nation with what seems to be goal of wiping out an entire race of people.So while we see the scenes in the camps, an angle I'm going to take in this review is the, and I hate to say it, brilliant efficiency of how it was carried out.  Before WWII ever started, there were years of grooming of the German people for this task.  Imagine you had lived at this time, with very few media outlets, and you were bombarded for years with newspaper and radio articles about the ""atrocities"" Jews committed.  This tactic really softened up the country for what was to come.We see how propaganda decends to public humiliation.  Then slowly laws are passed taking away more and more rights of these people (remember also that gypsies, the handicapped and homosexuals got this treatment, also).  Then comes the order that all Jews were to be isolated in very small areas and how they were to survive there was up to them.  This is roughly where the movies opens.The next move was the charade of the ""labor"" camps.  These facilities were merely fronts to weed out the weak, who were the most defenseless, and the least likely to cause a stink if missing. It was merely a tactic to do ""research and development"" on ways to mass dispose of humans.  It is from the ghettos and these camps that Schindler gets his first ""skilled workers"".The final depths are shown when the Nazis flat out drop the charade of ""work"" camps, and flat out start sending them to death camps.  The comparateley minor victory of Mr. Schindler saving a few humans is achieved here, but it is also where Speilberg clearly shows the ""business"" of mass murder.  When some of his people are diverted to a death camp, we are taken through the procedure.  The ""product"" comes in via a well-designed rail system.  They are divided into product categories, where ""salvage"" in the form of hair and clothes are removed for the war effort.  Before recieving the humiliating camp clothing, the product is ""decontaminated"" via a shower.  This shower may contain water or poison gas, depending on the capacity to process the finished product.  The central effect is a huge smokestack, ghostly lit at night.  Billowing 24 hours a day.  Looks like any other factory smokestack, but when you realize what the smoke is, you it's flat out frightening.The movie is not for the faint of heart, but anyone seeing it should emerge a better person for it."	5.0	A more powerful film I cannot imagine	2002-10-06	5	4	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2L3O3A14FBPD6	Eric	I've read that Schindler's List was Steven Spielberg's best work, but I avoided seeing the movie because I thought it would be something like the film adaptation of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank.&quot;  Last week, I finally got around to renting it and it was definitely worth it.  Schindler's List can be best described as &quot;black and white and disturbing.&quot;  It is difficult to criticize the movie because it would most likely sound ignorant if I did.  The graphic violence in Schindler's List is enough to turn the head of the strongest person, but that's the reason it was made.  Steven Spielberg spared no details.  When someone thinks of Spielberg, we usually recall movies like Jurassic Park and E.T.  Although these movies have moral behind it, Schindler's List is practically based on it.The display of black and white in the movie is appropriate; it signifies the bleak world of the Jewish people.  The examples of color in the film have profound effect.  When Schindler is watching the liquidation of the ghetto from a hill, he sees a young Jewish girl wandering the streets, the only color her bright red jacket.  Later in the film, when the concentration camp director Amon Goeth is ordered to burn the bodies of Jews, Schindler sees the red jacket wheelbarrowed off to the bonfire.  The look of shock and revelation on his face strikes your heart.  It is like the blind has been raised from the windows of his eyes and he is appalled by what he sees.The second color (not many reviewers have mentioned this) are the flames of the candles that Rabbi Levartov and others light during their preparation for the sabbath in Schindler's artillery shell factory.  The bright orange shines out of the bleak world of the Schindler Jews.See this movie, everyone.  It will change the way you think.	5.0	Black and white and disturbing	2001-04-12	2	2	0

Lyman	For the first time in nearly 100 Amazon reviews, I am giving a product a five-star rating while more or less suggesting that it may not be worth buying.The thought occurred to me just after my heart jumped a bit upon realizing that Schindler's List was about to be released in DVD, something that has been a long time coming.This is a rare example of a film that met with great commercial success and well-deserved critical acclaim, and it may be the film that hugely talented and prolific director Steven Spielberg will be remembered for. This is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made, and when I started building my DVD collection a few years ago I always considered the film's absence a glaring one.But now that now that I can finally add it to the collection, I wondered: do we buy DVDs of great films, or of films we want to watch again and again? If the answer is the former, Schindler's List is a perfect fit. But it it's the latter -- and I think it is -- then I am not so sure.This is not the kind of film one can watch without becoming involved, and involved in a profound way. It is important and difficult and uncomfortable and a masterpiece of modern cinema -- but is not enjoyable. Can anyone who has seen this film imagine watching it again to pass the time on a rainy night? Is it the motion picture you'd select to watch after ordering out for pizza when friends stop by? Not from my perspective, and that is why this great film won't soon be on the shelf with the rest of my DVDs.	5.0	Think twice	2004-02-04	19	14	5

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A15GA2HKLYPUMH	eridious@blizzdynasty.com	I have to say that in the seven years since Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg has yet to outdo himself. From the opening sequences of the Nazi banquet, to the final sequences of Schindler's Jewish workers today, one's  eyes will be completely glued to the screen; not because there is non-stop  action, but because they will be intrigued at how a Nazi that seemingly  only had his mind on money (and women) would save the lives of over one  thousand Jews from the concentration camps.Schindler's List is a  touching epic that combines powerful acting with directorial mastery, not  to mention the effectiveness of monotone for a documentary.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	"Any way you stack it, Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST is one of the most important and enlightening films ever made. It is a heartfelt, deeply personal film about one of the ghastliest events in human history--the Holocaust--and how one man, a Nazi profiteer by the name of Oskar Schindler, while motivated by money, managed to save some 1200 Jews from the gas chambers of Auschwitz during World War II.Spielberg wisely does not gloss over the fact that Schindler was every bit the womanizer as he was an astute, cagey businessman who made deals with the Nazis to set up an enamelware factory in the Cracow ghetto and employ the Jewish populace there. But his very trusted secretary Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) manages to awaken a latent spark of humanity in the once cold-blooded Schindler. By the time the war is over and the facts are known about the Nazi atrocities, Schindler is financially broke but spiritually enriched. ""He who saves one life saves the world entire.""Filmed in somber, documentary-like black-and-white by Janusz Kaminski, SCHINDLER'S LIST features superb performances by Neeson and Kingsley, as well as British actor Ralph Fiennes as the extraordinarily chilling Nazi commandant Amon Goeth, whose basic senses of Nazi business Schindler must appeal to while keeping the fact that he is sheltering the Jews a secret. Spielberg spares nothing in showing us the horrors of the Nazis barbarism; and although it is, not surprisingly, a very lengthy film (three hours and ten minutes), a lot happens for us to absorb, so it never becomes ponderous or heavy-handed.Winner of seven Oscars, including a Best Director nod to Spielberg that was long overdue, SCHINDLER'S LIST shows us the worst in humanity, but also the best as well. Even in so much pain and death, there is hope. And that is why this film is such a masterpiece."	5.0	The List Is A Life	2002-06-05	148	126	22

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A36ZN0G5IUNQH2	Erin Martin	"Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Schindler's List is set in Nazi occupied Poland during World War II. Oskar Schindler is a formerly failed businessman who takes advantage of the war by starting yet another business and employing Jews from the Krakow ghetto, who are cheap labor. Producing enamelware for the German war-effort and ""hiring"" an Jewish businessman named Itzhak Stern to manage the factory, Schindler made large profits until the order came to move all Jews into concentration camps. Those in the Krakow ghetto, and therefore Schindler's workers, are transported to Plaszow which is run by a man named Goeth. Witnessing the atrocities of the concentration camp, Schindler appeals to Goeth - whom he had befriended - to allow him to set up his factory outside of the ghetto and reemploy his workers, which are ""essential to the war-effort.""After some bribery, Goeth agrees to allow this and the workers are protected from being randomly killed by Nazi guards. Over time Schindler adds other ""necessary"" workers through information given to him from Stern, until again the Jews are to be relocated - this time to Aushwitz. By now the Jews know exactly what this means and are terrified. With this news Schindler nearly gives up his efforts to save his workers believing that there is nothing more he can do. However, he devises a plan at the last minute and he and Stern furiously create a list - Schindler's List - of all the workers he will need in creating a new factory back in his hometown of  Zwittau-Brinnlitz. Making it on this list meant assurance of life, versus certain death. Using the money his business had been making over the years, Schindler pays Goeth for each person on the list.Schindler operates his new factory until he basically goes broke. Luckily, this happens just before the German forces surrender to the Allied powers. All the Jews are automatically liberated now, and Schindler becomes the hunted as he is technically a member of the Nazi party. Saying their final goodbyes, the workers present Schindler with a letter signed by every worker attesting to his goodness as well as a ring engraved with a Talmudic Quotation which said, ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire."" The very last scene is of Schindler's grave, with his actual factory workers paying their respects by placing rocks on his headstone.In my opinion, Schindler's list is worth every one of the eight awards it has received, including being the 1993 Winner of the Academy Award's Best Picture. Additionally, in 2007 Schindler's List was elevated from 9th to 8th place on the American Film Institute's ""List of the 100 Best American Films."" Though the movie is graphic and does not shy away from showing the atrocities that came with the Holocaust, it also displays the rays of hope that penetrated the darkness of this genocide through people such as Schindler, who risked their lives for those they were ordered to hate and kill."	5.0	A Ray of Hope Penetrates a World of Darkness	2011-11-03	0	0	0

I do realize that it is filmed in grainy black and white and the visual advantage of DVD would be under-utilized, but such a powerful story needs bonus materials to satisfy and educate the viewers.Most aspects of this movie have been well covered by other people writing some fine reviews here, but one aspect that everyone seems to overlook is the side story where Amon falls for a jewish girl and has conflicting thoughts.  He can't understand his desire for her, when he has long accepted the treatment of the jews as animals.  In a scene where Schindler is trying to buy her from him, Fiennes does a very good job of portraying his grief of dealing with his own changing views.  Also in this scene, he makes Schindler realize that he is aware of what Schindler is doing, but will turn a blind eye to it anyway.  So not only has Schindler been mellowed out by the racial environment, but it was obvious that it was starting to affect the monster that Fiennes portrays as well.  If things had been allowed to progress as they were, perhaps Amon would have curved his own anti-semitic views under the influence of Schindler.	5.0	3/4	2000-10-19	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ADWQPR0LJD4J	"ERSInk . com ""Eric"""	"""Schindler's List"" is a difficult movie to watch. I can't say it's something you want to repeatedly view for entertainment because it's so tragic and downright depressing. The last time I watched it was in 1993. If it wasn't for the release of the movie on Blu-ray for its 20th anniversary, I quite possibly would've never seen the film again. All that being said, I'm glad I did. It was a reminder of the unspeakable events that unfolded during World War II and how easily they can happen.Oskar Schindler is an industrial businessman and member of the Nazi Party. He uses his factory as a means of employing Jews and keeping them from being sent to the concentration camps. As he continues his crusade to save as many Jews as he can, he comes dangerously close to having his true intentions discovered by the Nazi officials he must act like he's aligned with.To say ""Schindler's List"" is one of the most important films of the 1990s would be an understatement. It's quite possibly one of the most significant ones of the entire 20th century. It captures the best of both worlds when it comes to filmmaking. Director Steven Spielberg used all the modern tools at his disposal and crafted a movie that looks timeless and will never be considered irrelevant in any decade to come.The movie is as graphic as the subject matter demands it to be. The atrocities committed by the Nazis against the Jews need to be seen to pound home the horrific acts they unleashed upon them. Is it a bit too much for some people to see? Of course it is. If you think seeing it onscreen is tough, just think about how it was to live it.My only problem with ""Schindler's List"" is its scenes of sexuality. They are a distraction from the real purpose of the movie and give parents a reason to not allow their teenagers to view it. In a nutshell, they limit the amount of people who will be exposed to the movie.I completely understand the nudity when it comes to the Jews having to strip down naked and run around the camp. This shows the sort of humiliation they were put through and helps the audience identify with it. There's absolutely nothing sexy or sensual about that.The 20th Anniversary Blu-ray edition of ""Schindler's List"" was painstakingly restored and supervised by Steven Spielberg. The audio and video transfers are absolutely flawless. The picture is black and white with tiny splashes of color here and there throughout. The 5.1 surround sound uses the quiet of hiding and the noisy chaos of the Ghetto and concentration camps to properly put audiences in the middle of the circumstances unfolding on film.The special features for the Blu-ray version of ""Schindler's List"" will probably disappoint most consumers. There's a 77-minute documentary entitled ""Voices from the List"" in which director Steven Spielberg interviews Holocaust survivors and their descendants. He also shares background on the organization he founded through the 5-minute featurette ""USC Shoah Foundation Story with Steven Spielberg."" A promotional spot for the online application IWitness is also included.""Schindler's List"" will go down in history as one of the most important films ever released in all of human history. Thanks to its cinematography and classic black and white format, it maintains a timeless feel that will serve it well in the decades to come.

Some scenes really reveal how gentiles hate our people, I always have in my mind the piece where the German shoot through the floor of the Jewish houses after deportation, and blood drops, or for what reasons they murder Jews in the camps, etc. Spielberg is a notorious Jew who has shown himself to be true to his race by making this movie, and I will always be grateful to him for this everlasting and terrific tribute to the unique hardship of our race. I recommend this movie to all gentiles so that they know where critics and attacks on us lead to, (and I also recommend it to anti-Semitic Jews such as Finkelstein and Shahak. Watching this movie helped me also concretely realize that our people is not only unique in that it was chosen by God, but also in that our suffering is unique : As world-acclaimed professor Lipstadt says in her books, the suffering of all other races cannot be compared to the Holocaust - the Shoa as we call it in Hebrew --, which as the movie shows, is far beyond of all kind of hate one could image. This movie is a proof of Lipstadt's thesis, and watching it is a required antidote against anti-Semitism.	5.0	Shows that anti-Semitism is wrong	2001-07-16	5	1	4

Spielberg doesn't hold back to show the world the true horror that we went through during the Holocaust, and the unlikely hero that saved 1500 Jews from extermination. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, it chroniclizes the events that led up to Oskar having an enterprise to a haven that saved Jews. Ben Kingsly is his Jewish accountant that helps him through troubled times. It even shows Oskar trying to show Amon Goeth, a very brutal Nazi, what's going on and what he his doing is very wrong.

It's so graphic and realistic it'll make your stomach turn. You get so absorbed into the whole story that you actually feel as if you were there.Oscar Schindler does not exactly fit your average description of a hero. He often got drunk, womanized, cheated on his wife, and barely seemed to have a heart. And, of course, he belonged to the Nazi party.Who would've known that he would willingly save the lives of 1200 Jews? Apparently, heroism comes in all shapes and forms.Steven Spielberg truly deserves all the praise (and even more than that!) that he got for creating this film. Other than the story, which was, of course, incredibly interesting, beautiful and ugly at the same time, the special effects were truly incredible, starting with the famous red dress. When I saw that little girl ""in the red dress"" had died, I broke down in tears, even if she never was a main character in the whole plot.I thought the ending was truly fantastic. I loved it how they showed all the ""Schindler Jews"" visiting Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. That was very beautiful.Thanks, Spielberg, for showing the world just how amazing this man called Oscar Schindler was."	5.0	Schindler's List	2005-09-05	5	4	1

I have waited for this movie to be released on dvd. The movie is great, a film that everyone should see, once you can open up the special edition. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how open the plastic case. I almost broke it twice. The gruff that some are making about it being a flipper disc, well it reminds me of playing records. There is a certain nostalgia in having to flip it over, but trepidation in scratching the new dvd in removing it from the case. You receive some interesting paraphenalia: a book of pictures from the film with background material about Spielberg making it; a pamphlet that states the same information in said book with an envelope for fund-raising for the Shoah Foundation; a piece of the actual film, though how limited red-coat girl is left for the gods; and included with the movie, the soundtrack. So basically, you're spending 60 bucks for a $19 dollar movie and a $15 dollar soundtrack with some fluff thrown in. Buy both instead of this.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1LYQL40IB7SBL	FNDNreview	In Schindler&#8217;s List, Liam Neeson stars as Oskar Schindler, a businessman (and member of the Nazi party) that takes advantage of the invasion of Poland by the German army.  Once in Poland, Schindler uses his money to bribe Nazi officers, thus allowing him to take over a production facility &#8211; where he heavily profits from the production and sale of army mess supplies (using Jewish workers).  In order to run the business, he persuades a member of the Jewish business community, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinglsey) to manage his books and finances.  However, once the Nazis start forcing Jews into ghettos, Schindler witnesses firsthand the senseless massacre of Jews &#8211; by SS officers, like Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), and becomes sympathetic to their struggle to survive under the Nazi occupation.  With his newfound wealth, Schindler does all he can to maintain his partnership with the Nazis, while protecting his Jewish production workers.  Embeth Davidtz, Caroline Goodall, and Jonathan Sagall also star in supporting roles.The film&#8217;s focal point, Oskar Schindler, serves as a neutral figure turned protagonist.  When we first meet this man on screen, he cares more about money and women than what&#8217;s happening around him.  It&#8217;s not until he sees the (now famous) girl in the red dress that he has a change of heart about the Jews.  However, he is smart enough to protect his Jewish workers in a legitimate way, while still appearing to be loyal to the Nazi party.  On the other hand, the antagonist &#8211; Nazi officer, Amon Goeth, was an uncontrollable madman with a license to kill.  Unfortunately, Nazi officers didn&#8217;t see what they were doing as malicious or unethical &#8211; but rather a cleansing of the population.  And, once again, Spielberg carries out this daunting portrayal with exasperating perfection.War films are notorious for getting it wrong.  For examples, look no further than Pearl Harbor or The Patriot &#8211; two films that cared more about the historical backdrop than telling a true story.  Obviously, those two particular films came way after the release of the critically-acclaimed story of Oskar Schindler (showing how backwards film-making has gone).  One of the many reasons this is such a widely praised film is the fact that Spielberg cared more about telling a true, realistic story than anything else.  The correct story always starts with the correct cinematography &#8211; and while cinematography is a technical term that doesn&#8217;t always fit into a date night review, it has to be the starting point here.  In this particular film, an effective documentary style of filming is used &#8211; not to mention in black a white, both of which would be correct to their time period had this film been shot in the early 1940s.The Nazi camps had to be recreated for the film, but they were done in close proximity to the originals with the majority of filming taking place where the actual, real-life events took place.  These camps give viewers a small taste of the absurd, malicious conditions that the Nazis forced their captives to endure until the end of the war &#8211; assuming they survived that long.  Not only did Spielberg succeed in bringing these work camps to life on the big screen, he also gives a very real depiction of the Nazi officers &#8211; who were allowed a great deal of leeway to eliminate Jews as they saw fit.  If a Jew rested for a moment while they were supposed to be working, they were quickly executed with prejudice.Schindler&#8217;s List is a film that can&#8217;t be praised enough and there&#8217;s very little doubt this is a film that deserves to be written about extensively &#8211; not via a short film review.  Regardless, this film - along with Saving Private Ryan, are collectively Steven Spielberg&#8217;s finest directing achievements and honor those that were lost in World War II&#62;Overall Film Grade:  AFNDNrevew.com	5.0	Spielberg at his very best	2013-03-06	5	5	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1XOZW9A8TL7JY	Four Star Film Fan	This film is one of the best biographical films and it highlights one of the monstrosities of humanity in the form of the Holocaust. It may be hard to watch and it is overpowering but the fact is the types of events depicted actually happened and must be recognized. The characters of Oskar Schindler and Ammon Goth further make the story come alive serving as a sharp contrast to each other. From the beginning this film opens in black and white making you realize there is something special here. With Speilberg behind the camera, Liam Neeson takes on the role of Oskar Schindler. Historically, this German industrialist aided over a thousand Jews from the Holocaust. Neeson skillful portrays his character revealing the turmoil and peril Schindler faced. The cast is rounded out nicely by Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes. The film effectively moves the viewer to ponder humanity and also causes us to praise Schindler. Fittingly the movie closes with many surviving Jews laying flowers on the grave of their savior.	5.0	Schindler's List (1993)	2013-06-01	0	0	0

Schindler was a proud and covetous German man of affairs. He opened up a factory of all jewish workers, they worked for little to no profit at all. The setting of film is 1940s Poland, under Nazi rule and control, which was good for business seeing that Jewish freedom became more and more slim to not existant. Although taking advantage of Jewish labor was very profitable to Oskar Schindler, it ultimately was not nearly as close to the worth of the agony that was dealt upon the Judaic community. Seeing the Jews being slain in many different and horrible ways ""flipped a switch"" sort of speak, in Schindler. Now a reformed man with a new level of sympathy towards the Jews, what was once a factory that only served the purpose as a place of hard work for jews was now something like a sanctuary. Creating a list of who all now inhabbited the ""sanctuary"", Schindler's list presented over eleven hundred names of jewish residents he had single handedly saved from gas chambers. Oskar Schindler showed that we all have a little good in us. Eventhough this is a story of Hebraism there were still some qualities of christian ethics integrated within this film, for instence, giving up the materialistic for a conscience spirit. Oskar gave up the probability of being wealthy to save the lives of those not as fortunate."	4.0	schindlers list masterpiece	2012-11-18	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1G9FX1KV45N41	Gary Selikow	"Oskar Schindler was a maverick Sudeten German industrialist, who put his life and livelihood on the line to save 6,000 Jews from the Nazi death machine.This is his story, but not his story alone. It is also the story of the 6 million Jews who perished in Hitler's holocaust, and the 6 000 who where saved by Oscar Schindler.The movie is masterfully portrayed, and was indeed true to the book by Thomas Keneally.It is three harrowing hours about the unspeakable horrors visited upon the Jewish men, women and children who Hitler and his Nazi Party had decided had to die.The images that take place in the movie will stay in your mind forever.The antagonist to the compassion of Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is the sadistic monster, the SS Commandant Amon Goeth. Schindler and Goeth are both members of the Nazi Party in high standing, who mixes in the same circles, and both make splash at the debauched Nazi parties held at Goethe's villa. But their reaction to the merciless slaughter is diametrically opposed. It brings out the man of compassion in Schindler, and the psychopathic demon in Goeth.During the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto, we see even the difference in their mistresses. After Schindler and his mistress Ingrid have gone for a morning ride, they observe from a hilltop the horrors the SS are visiting among the Jewish population of the Warsaw ghetto. And Ingrid visibly upset says "" Oscar, let's get out of here""Goeth on the other hand is taking pot-shots at the Jews on the streets below with his hunting rifle. His mistress Majola, simply sighs and says `Amon, you are such a dammn child.' irritated that she has been woken by the gunshots, and that she is not receiving Goeth's attention, but completely cold to the slaughter going on around her.But two scenes stood out most in my mind.That of as beautiful Jewish girl child, of about four  years of age, in a bright red jacket, which is the only colour plate in the black and white movie. Schindler observes this angelic child making her way through the crowds of Jews who are being herded out the ghetto by the Nazis. We see the little girl hiding under a bed, terrified, and that is the last time we see her, before we see later in the movie, her mangled little body, being wheeled to the crematorium on a trolley, identified by her red jacket.The story of the little girl in red made me think of another child. A beautiful and vivacious child, who was murdered 60 years later by Arafatian terrorists at Adura in Judea, as she hid terrified under her parent's bed-Danielle Shefi.G-D bless the lovely souls of the angels - the little girl in red who died at Auschwitz, and of Danielle Shefi, who died at Adura. .  G-D bless the souls of all Jewish children murdered by the enemies of the Jews and of Israel.The other scene that brought tears to my eyes, was at the end of the movie where the Schindlerjuden march in the direction of Israel singing a hauntingly beautiful rendition of Yerushalayem Shel Zahav (Jerusalem of Gold), before we see the Schindlerjuden and their children and grandchildren, in real life, placing stones on the grave of Oscar Schindler at the Christian cemetery in Jerusalem.This movie must be shown to all high school students, so that they can be equipped to answer so many questions that are thrown at us today: Why did the Jews not rise up? , Why did the Nazis do what they did? Why did the people of Europe allow it to happen? Why do we need the State of Israel?We are living through a time when the same hatreds are rising again. Hatred of Israel is the new form of anti-Semitism that has shown it's hideous face again. I look at the scene, near the beginning of the movie, where the Jews are being herded into the ghettoes , and a young Polish girl of about 11, is shouting `You bad Jews, you bad Jews'.And I think of all the anti-Israel demonstrations taking place today, where the same voices of hate, and bloodlust are being raised."	5.0	A dedication	2004-10-21	4	2	2

Schindler who is a member of the Nazi Party during WWII, buys a factory to gain wealth as a war profiteer to produce army mess kits. To run his factory, Schindler hires Jews to work for him because the labor is cheaper than hiring Catholics. This also assures the Jews safety from being killed or sent to the concentration camps because they are helping the war efforts for the Germans. Schindler ends up having a change of heart once he wittnesses Jewish people being murdered in front of him and it bothered him to his core. This is when Schindler makes it his mission to save as many lives as he can. Schindler ended up spending his wealth on saving the Jew's who worked in his factory by buying off the Nazi guards and not producing any real product in his factory. This movie relates to world religions because it showcases the epic battle that humans have been fighting essentially since the beginging of time.

It's brutal, shocking and sad but it's a reality we all must face and in the end be inspired by. Oskar Schindler was a hero of epic proportion and the brave souls he rescued from certain death are a great testimony to the power of the human will and to the ultimate victory of good over evil.

The worst part is for the most part people have forgotten. Today's youth certainly has. They don't really know what really happened and that is a shame. Mankind has really sunk to some low places in human behavior and this ranks as one of, if not the lowest, point in human history! But don't forget we also had Stalin and the Japanese warlords competing with the Nazis for worst place! Seventy years ago and we've been through very many more since. I wonder if humankind will ever not do these things. It always seems hate takes hold and runs amok for sometime before reason and sanity take over and conquer the hate. A visious cylce it seems.

It is about a German Nazi named Oskar Schindler and how he ending up helping save many Jewish lives. Schindler starts of as a lavish, lady loving, business man who wants to start up a factory. In the process of getting his factory started he works with a Jewish man Itzhak Stern to help him out. Schindler hires Jewish workers because their labor is very cheap but as time goes on his interests turn from making money to keeping his workers safe after he sees some horrible things happen at the concentration camps.  Schindler makes a &#8220;list&#8221; of names of people that he wants to be kept safe and sent to a place he has arranged for them to go. Schindler ends of saving many lives through extreme bribery before he himself has to run away to avoid capture at the end of the war since he is a Nazi.World ReligionSchindler&#8217;s List tells a story of the Holocaust which is also known as the Shoah. The acts of violence that were shown in the movie were clearly a &#8220;whirlwind&#8221;. In studying world religions one can see that the &#8220;hatred&#8221; of the Jewish people started long before Hitler but it goes all the way back to the Romans and is followed by the Christians. The Shoah really shows just how strong peoples hatred for the Jewish really was. As a result of the Holocaust about one third of the world&#8217;s Jewish population was killed, at the end of the movie the descendants of survivors that were saved by Schindler are shown so you can see the impact he has had today even though he felt like he should have done more.Schindler&#8217;s List is also filled with plenty of Jewish religious references. One very noticeable reference is the Star of David, which is a symbol of Jewish identity, which every Jewish person had to wear on them at all times. At one point in the movie the evil Nazi Goeth referred to Schindler as Moses since he was trying to save &#8220;his people&#8221; (his Jewish workers). There is reference of the Sabbath and that the people needed to prepare for it because it was already Friday night. The ring that Schindler is given at the end of the movie has writings from the Talmud which are works of commentary on the laws of the Torah and teachings of the Hebrew bible. The final scene of where all the Jews are singing in Hebrew and walking to get to a safe land compares to Moses and his people looking for their promise land.	5.0	Summary and Religious review	2014-04-01	1	0	1

It shows the exploitation of the Jewish people during WWII and it does so without apology. No apology is needed because those horrors must be exposed to help keep them from occurring ever again.Why Hollywood cannot make ONE movie without showing a breast is beyond me though. Totally out of place, just done gratutiously. Keep your teen boys away.Other than its deliberate exposure of the woman (not a prisoner, she was there to entice audience only) and its attempt to demean women in the audience by showing - once again - an actress exploited for the world to see - this movie's address for the concentration camps and Schindler's incredible attempt to do all in his power to stop the horrors is a masterpiece.The word masterpiece is overused in Hollywood.

The movie also stars Ralph Fiennes (brother of Joseph) as the evil Amon Goeth, exuding pure malice as one of the most sadistic German captains of the evil Nazi regime (should've won Best Supporting Actor; no disrespect to Tommy Lee Jones, who won for ""The Fugitive."") Oscar-winner Ben Kingsley (""Ghandi,"" etc) also stars as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's secretary. The movie is very sad in its hard-hitting account of the suffering the Germans put the Jews through during ""Six long years of murder"" and the man who fought to rescue them. The movie was filmed in black and white, not only because the violence would have been too graphic in color, but because that was Steven's vision of the film. The film's most poignant moments came at the end (I'm not spoiling it). John Williams' magnificent and heart-wrenching score (accompanied by Itzhak Perlman's heart-felt violin solos) resonates with you long after the end credits roll. Recently honored at the Kennedy Center Honors, Itzhak Perlman played John Williams' score from ""Schindler's List"" after saying a few things, looking up and saying ""John, this one's for you,"" before a medley of his most popular film scores was played (""Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"" ""E.T.,"" ""Superman"" and of course, ""STAR WARS""). Special features include a ""Voices Of The Holocaust"" documentary hosted by Steven Spielberg, cast and crew bios/credits and more. What's really lacking is a making-of documentary, cast/crew interviews and trailers. The film earned the seven Oscars it won in 1993, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Score. The DTS 5.1 track on the DVD is excellent, as it allows you to experience the grittiness of the picture exactly as Steven intended. The anamorphic widescreen enhances the quality of the picture even more. This movie is DEFINITELY NOT FOR CHILDREN!!

The movie is probably the highly of Spielberg's career. It is about Oscar Schindler who was a Nazi and who saved many Jews during the Holocaust. This movie is shown in black and white, which really draws the audience into the movie and the feel of the 1940s. The only color is a red coat on a little girl, which Spielberg does intentionally so pay attention to that. This is emotionally charged and I usually cry a great deal during this movie.

Liam Neeson gave the performance of his life as Schindler the man who broke in his business but helped more than one thousand Poland Jews from being exterminated  Ben Kingsley is the conciliate factor and obviously what else can you add to this actor who actually is one of the twelve giants actors in the world . And finally Ralph Fiennes who grew up one thousand steps with this role as an abominable and hated Nazi all along the film without falling in overacting .The locations in Poland are first rate , the sinister atmosphere, the ravishing handle camera , the splendid photography and a fine script make of this film to my mind the Best American Film of the Nineties , one of the three most ambitious and compelling films which dealt with this theme  and the supreme masterpiece of Steven Spielberg .And this happens only when the camera is an eye in the mind of a poet .Spielberg followed his bliss and won for ever . You can forget all his previous works , because with Saving Private Ryan , Spielberg has been one of the few directors capable to give a tragic and epic vision of the War in less than a decade among both films.  .Pitifully these giants films are not the rule but the exception ..	5.0	When the talent and the commitment join its forces!	2004-12-28	3	2	1

It brings home forcefully just how the insanity of one man, Adolph Hitler, could cause so much death and suffering for a period of over ten years.  But the movie is mainly the story of Oskar Schindler, who appears at first to be nothing more than an opportunist only too ready to take advantage of wartime Europe in order to become rich.  However, in time he finds himself becoming the unwitting savior of over a thousand Jews.  It also paints a stunning portrait of such Nazi madmen as concentration camp commandant, Amon Goeth, who finds himself going slowly mad because of his own excesses.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1WQXMS2620FON	Hope	"Steven Spielberg out does himself in this documentary about the Holocaust.  The film was a block office hit earning over $321 million. The music is dramatic, as are the scenes and acting, earning this film 7 Academy Awards. The film is mostly filmed in Krakow, Poland as Spielberg Chronicles the transformation of Oskar Schindler during one of the worst atrocities to happen to humanity.  This 1993 film is based on the novel ""Schindler's Ark"" by Thomas Keneally.  The movie is about the life of Oskar Schindler, a German business man, and how he becomes instrumental in saving the lives of over a 1000 Polish-Jews.The film is artfully done in Black & White, which emphasizes the mood of the times.  The stage is set in Poland, September 1939, when Germany first starts requiring Jews to register with them.  This is just the first step towards the ultimate goal of genocide. The Germans move fast from registration to ousting Jews from their homes in 1940.  The relocation of the Jews to ghettos was just the beginning of the atrocities about to happen to the Jewish people.  The once Jewish owned homes were then given to German officers.Once the Jews were no longer able to own businesses, Schindler sees the opportunity to make money.  Schindler was in good standing in the Nazi party and used bribery and debauchery to get what he wanted.  Schlinder uses Jewish workers in his factory and has to prove that his workers were essential for his business.  If a Jew was deemed non-essential, it was a death sentence.  The Killing of Jews expedited quickly as racial hate took over the German war machine and the genocide of Jews became rampant and unprecedented.Soon the Jews were herded out of the ghettos and forced to death or work camps.  This included Schlinder's Jews, as they were transported to a work camp.  Schlinder had to keep bribing German officials to keep his workers from being exterminated.  It did not take long for people to become aware of the death camps and the gassing of thousands upon thousands of Jewish people. The film is hard to watch at times as the horrors bestowed upon the Jews by the Nazis were disturbing and factual.Schlinder made a list of all of his workers from his factory that he wanted to try to save. Schlinder went to great lengths to try to save between 1100 and 1200 Jews by having them relocated to a village in the Czech Republic, but Schlinder's goal to get his workers out of Poland was almost a disaster. The men and women were separated on different trains and while the men went on to the Czech Republic, the women and children were accidently routed to Auschwitz, the worst death camp.  However, through Schindler's efforts, they were saved from Auschwitz and all made it to the factory in the Czech Republic.Even though Schindler was known as a war profiteer and a womanizer, and while he was motivated by money he still ended up being a hero to hundreds of Jews, humanitarian and savior. This dark, horrific time in world history will not be forgotten, but we should also not forget those people that made a difference.  The hopes of this movie is to shed light on the horrors perpetrated to an entire race of people for future generations to always remember what can happen when hate is allowed to run rampant in the hearts of men and how even one person can change lives, even save lives and make a difference.This movie relates to my World Religion class as it chronicles the hardships that the Jewish people went through during this time of war and genocide.  Around 6 million Jews were killed during this horrific time in world history, in Jewish history.  No one can ever study Judaism without studying the holocaust.  Yet, no one should have to study it, because it should have never happened, but it did, and now we can never forget."	5.0	there is hope, even during genocide	2013-11-01	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A355WMP0CQBJFX	horrorqueen	schindeler's list, one of the best movies of all time, without a doubt, and one of my absolute favorites. this movie is a masterpiece. very touching on so many levels. it truly is an eye opener, and gives it to you straight. no beating around the bush. very sad, and a tragedy that was so terrible and unreasonable. about one madmans sadistic ruling over so many helpless people. this movie from beginning to end hits you right in the heart. overall look through the eyes of a man who at first didn't give a damn about noone but himself, and turned out to be the savior of so many thankful people. to this day he is remembered. the era of the holocaust. such a tragic event in history, and the fact that this film is based on one man's journey through this rough time makes it all the more realer. if you have not seen it, then you must because there is hardly any words to make you understand what you will feel once you have seen this movie. it starts with the jews giving their names, profession, and they all have to wear a star. the star is a brand. they are branded as jews. little by little they are being kicked out of homes, discarded in the streets, driven off to consentration camps, or thrown in to caged areas to live. they are stripped of their possesions, their identities,  they are ripped from their families, and they have no say. they can not object, they can not think, and they can not escape for they will be executed. it is an extermination of all people who are jewish. a command to be carried out as brutally as one can imagine, by a man so evil and sinister he is hell on earth. then comes oscar shindler, a womanizer who's only goal is to make money and look out for himself. he sees what occurs around him but feels nothing and doesn't really care. if it doesn't affect him, what does it matter. he never thought twice about being a part of the nazi crew. until he met itzhak stern, his helper. together they purchase a factory ready to make money, but itzhak has other plans. he knows that this factory can save lives of the hell that surrounds them. so one by one he recruites people. as many as he can to come to schindlers place to work. then oscar realizes what is happening and he can't help but feel some kind of guilt, remorse, and sympathy for these people who have done nothing wrong. he starts to become involved, more aware, and goes broke in order to buy these people, or bribe the higher officials, all in order to save lives. this becomes his goal, he thinks of nothing else but this. all the while making sure he never got caught. by the end you are so involved in the movie you just can't help not to think about it and realize what kind of a man it takes to put his life at risk for others. what do you call a man that gives up everything for these people he knew nothing about. these people that are known as schindlers people. people he grew to care for. thus after this he became a different man. he gained their respect, their love, and their admiration forever. this movie is of the deepest kind, for real, and no other has come to compare to this film. wonderful actors, great depiction of real life events, and a sad but beautiful story. another lesson learned, never give up hope. liam neeson, wonderful actor, excellent role and i got hooked on him after i saw this film. he does it just right. i have just touched the tip of this movie with my review, it is a must see, for all. you see this and you realize that life isn't so bad. at least we have a choice.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A27MIRZEVUJ5MW	House Of Pawz Chilton	Kristi ChiltonSchindler List was a documentary released in 1993 which recreated the events that occurred in the Holocaust. The movie is about a business man named Oskar Schindler who inatiaonally was all about making money for himself. He began hiring Jews to work for him with little pay so he would profit more. However as WWII continued he realized what the Nazis were doing was inhumane and had a change of heart. The whole movie was very sad and will remain in my thoughts but a couple of scene really had me choked up more than the rest. The movie obviously was made in black and white however there was a little girl in the red coat throughout the movie that I believe represented the Jews innocence's. The little girl should not have been seen as a threat to the Nazis but eventually her red coat was also seen among the bodies. This scene to me displayed the Nazis as having no empathy toward other human beings. The second scene was in the end when the actual Jews that had survived with the help of Schindler were placing rocks on his grave. When I watched this movie I was amazed at the effect it had on me. I have always seen Steven Spielberg movies as excellent but he really did a wonderful job recreating the events on the Holocaust. I would have to say it defiantly will give even the hardest individual a new perspective on the tragic events that occurred throughout history. A main focus point for me was although Schindler came from different cultural background than the Jews he dedicated his life trying to save them regardless of the differences.	4.0	Wonderful Movie	2008-10-31	3	1	2

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3URTG22M2SYYZ	H. Qureshi	This was the first time I ever saw this movie. It is a heartfelt enigmatic story about a man who chose differently in a time of monotony. Oskar Schindler's story is one that became lost in the shuffle of Nazi Germany. With his effort to promote his enamelware company in Poland he was able to house and save the lives of hundreds of Jews that became victim to the clutches of Hitler's reign.  This movie is a slight glimpse of the horrors faced by the Jewish people during the holocaust. The movie portrays the heartless, bloodthirsty, brainwashed heart of Germany during the holocaust in the form of Amon Goeth, the General who led one of the Jewish labor camps. It is a vivid description of the soulless torture that took place during that time, and how Oskar Schindler was driven to save the lives of hundreds of Jewish laborers without once thinking about his personal gains.This movie is related to World Religions because it highlights the period of the holocaust. It also shows the Jewish culture which is rich with tradition. Oskar Schindler, however, was tolerant, he promoted that the Jews carried on their traditions while they worked under him, he encouraged that they carry on the Sabbath tradition, chant hymns and pray according to their faith.  There is even a scene with a Jewish marriage being carried on in one of the camps. The movie also portrays the misfortunes that the Jews faced; the untimely deaths, the crippling tortures, the loss of lives, loves, and traditions.This story however, merely scratches the surface of the depressing tortures that came to be during the holocaust, or the Cleansing of Germany. Oskar Schindler's tale is enamoring and very inspirational. It teaches us to have hope in times when there is none.	5.0	Schindler's List	2008-10-31	0	0	0

It gave the movie a magical touch.*The direction was  brilliant. I was amazed that Steven Spielberg could make a good movie that  doesn't rely on visual effects, like the rest of his movies.*The  editing(done by the same talented editor of Saving Private Ryan, Michael  Kahn)was amazing too.*The score was perfect. John Williams is always  amazing.Cons:*Some &quot;facts&quot; in it should've been said to be  fictitious, like the 6 million number .Shame on you, Spielberg.*The  movie (at 3+ hours) is too long.*Where are the translations of the  Hebrew and German dialogues?Bottomline: Not worth the noise.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1S6R4KO718O4G	Isaac Billiou	But I guess that's what the Greeks meant by &#34;catharsis.&#34;  One of the great stories of all time, sadly predicated on perhaps the worst horror of all time, National Socialism.  Schindler  was an unusual character:  exposure to so much inhumanity and brutality made him more humane.  From a pretty cynical guy out to make a quick Reichsmark, he ended up giving his last pfennig to save his Jewish workers.  His saving grace was, I think, that he didn't go for dogma or accepted ideas, Nazi propaganda or otherwise (he was a nominal but indifferent Nazi and Catholic):  When he saw another human being, he just saw another human being not some cooked-up notion.  What is scary is that in a short period of totalitarian rule, so many monsters come out of the closet and, more scary, so many normal people are transformed into Believers...and monsters.  Then again, the Hope from the Ashes is exactly that very self-sacrificing decent people like Oskar Schindler likewise emerge from obscurity.  The ending, switching to color (I am old enough to remember at age 4 or so seeing the Wizard of Oz) and the survivors in 1993....was brilliant.  And immensely touching.	5.0	"Hard to say I ""love"" a movie like this.  I was sobbing often throughout and uncontrollably at the end"	2013-05-29	0	0	0

The movie is so moving and powerful words can't do it justice. Spielberg for all of his great movies: Jaws, Close Encounters, Raider's, ET ect. None compare with the masterpiece that is Schilder's List. Not even Saving Privite Ryan, while being as powerful, the movie doesn't hold together as well as Schinder's List. Spielberg threw his heart and soul in this movie and you can tell. The Holocaust is one of the most tragic events in human history, and no movie can ever relate the horror of what happened. But in Schindler's List Spielberg comes as close as one can. The film is shot in Poland on some of the actual sights the real events happened. The true story of how a German businessman/war profiteer saved over 1100 Jews in WWII. With great performances by Liam Leeson, Ben Kingsley and a truely horrifying performance by Ralph Fiennes.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	"This film was and still is a revolution in our approach of the Shoah, the Holocaust, the extermination of the Jews during the second world war. It reveals in shocking images the tactics used by the Nazis to capture the Jews, here in Poland, in order to seize their possessions and to transform them into slaves. In each city of some importance all the Jews of a region were compelled to regroup and live entirely within the militarily controlled limits of a ghetto. Then the Nazi Party imposed the election or appointing of a Jewish Council to manage the ghetto, that is to say to implement the orders from the Nazis. Then some businessmen, essentially industrialists came to provide the Jews with work and there the Jews became consenting even if forced slaves and later on the ghettos will be liquidated and forced labor camps will further transform the Jews into inmates forced to work for the businessman and kept in order by some SS unit. The value of the film comes from the fact that the industrialist concerned in Krakow, Schindler himself, comes from previously independent Czechoslovakia and is a member of the Nazi party with important connections in Berlin that gives him the upper hand even on the SS. It is unluckily slightly difficult to believe it since the connections are not brought within our knowledge. Who could in Nazi Germany be more powerful than the SS? The film will show how much money this man was able to make with that slave labor. Real fortunes that enabled him to double his political influence with financial corruption. But there it shows how the Jews from the very beginning (the order to go and live in the closest ghettos) right to the very end (either their being sent to Auschwitz to be gassed or being saved and freed by Schindler) will always disbelieve the worst news they could get and always believe in some kind of higher order that will either sacrifice them or save them, that order being from another dimension of time and space. Is it divine, is it a God, is it some kind of cosmic force? No one knows which one, but it is a force against which you cannot do anything. You have to submit and survive if it so pleases this force. This submissiveness is never questioned and hardly contrasted to some Jewish individuals, and only individuals, who would have thought of resisting, or at least escaping. No matter what happens, they sing a song of lamentation or a song of thanks, but they were reduced to a herd of cattle and they submitted to that fate. It is pathetic to see how Schindler's Jews do not protest against any violence or whatever. They just, on arriving in Auschwitz, call the name of their ""Nazi Master"", Schindler himself. They have been reduced to being Schindler's herd. The vision is absolutely disquieting, disturbing, sickening. That definitely is the worst part of such a war. And that absolute alienation is constantly brought back by any war, be it in Palestine, in Lebanon or in Iraq. That's were the film is poignant and at the same time finds its limit. The film avoids all other types of exterminated group, ethnic or not, because all these other groups produced another attitude: rebellion, refusal, fight, struggle. It is also important to see that even in Poland, even in these ghettos, even within these Jewish Councils there was some refusal, rebellion, even a rebellion in the name of freedom in spite of it meaning immediate death: better die than submit to the final degradation, alienation, internalized victimization. Stephen Spielberg hence does not reflect the whole historical truth but favors one approach only. That explains why the film feels as having aged with time and the end definitely becomes morbidly sentimental: love and gratefulness for the one who made them slaves and only saved them because they were his property that he bought with the money they produced. He is only saving his own possessions, like a rancher would protect his herd. The ending thus is too positive to be acceptable. If the Jews had been able to massively move into rebellion, resistance, guerrilla warfare or even plain warfare, the war could have been different. We are speaking of more than two million Jews just in Poland. To run down such a human wall you need time and quite a lot of tanks and planes. Hence it does not bring in any profit but cost a tremendous amount of money. Could Hitler have afforded it without having to cut some further actions short? A beautiful black and white film but that only shows one side of the picture.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"	4.0	The film is weakened by its being onesided	2007-10-21	7	1	6

The im-ages have not left me since I turned the dvd player off. What struck me about this was how much the Holocaust was empty to me before this. I think that the reason that I felt emptiness when studying the Holocaust previously when I wanted to feel pain and grief is that it lacked reality. My mind was pro-tecting itself from the horror, the sadness of the ruthless realities of the organized killing of millions. When I had previously studied the Holocaust, I was shown pictures, bombarded with numbers of the dead and exiled, struck by the written accounts, one after another, but for all the evidence, it wasn't real pain. It wasn't real death. It wasn't a tangible. That's why this movie hit me so hard. Even thinking about it transports me back and brings me close to tears again. It hit me so fully watching this movie, because every time I cried my mind would automatically try to comfort me by thinking ""this is not real, this CANNOT be real."" but every time I would catch myself and remember that it was real, it was all real, and I cried. I felt. I hurt, and it felt so good to finally feel something about this event, which I had longed to feel something about ever since the first time I heard about it. I am so grateful for the pain that filled me at every heart wrenching moment, because it made me feel human.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3H5D6XCL6A2K3	Jake	"Let me tell you, never before have I been as mesmerized, touched, and enthralled by such a dramatic movie as this. Without a doubt there is no equal to Steven Spielberg in this day and age, and also no better acting talent than the ones assembled for the roles in ""Schindler's List."" Liam Neeson gives such a forcefully powerful role of the conflicted Oskar Schindler, with Ralph Fiennes as the even more emotional and captivating character in this film (that of Amon). Fine work is also turned out by renowned legend Sir Ben Kingsley, not to mention the other fantastic minor parts in the feature such as Caroline Goodall as Emilie. However, it goes without saying that this film's epic proportions would not have reached as high a stature without the enduring work and grueling hours of effort put in behind the scenes by the lesser known faces. One of these names includes the brilliant hand of writer Steve Zaillian,  beautifully adapted the chilling Thomas Keneally novel for the big screen (not to mention picking up the kudos from Mr. Oscar). Then there's composer John Williams, a musical mastermind who's haunting yet irresistible score to this picture has added another cinematic achievement onto his shelf (which happens to include the scores to ""Star Wars Trilogy,"" ""Indiana Jones Trilogy,"" ""ET,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Superman,"" and many other timeless classics). Producers Branko Lustig and Gerald Molen may sound unfamiliar to many, but not if you read their credits which include their marvelous work on this film (these credits include ""Rain Man,"" ""The Color Purple,"" Gladiator,"" ""Black Hawk Down,""Tootsie,"" and others). Other names for sure worthy of mention, and believe me I cannot name them all, include cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, editor Michael Kahn, chief casting director Juliet Taylor, production designer Allan Starski, set decorator Ewa Brau, costume designer Anna Sheppard, film distributors MCA/Universal and Amblin Entertainment, the Art, Makeup, Production, Directors, Sound, and Effects departments, and all the other individuals that made this award-winning drama possible.To conclude this review, I'd just like to say that I've been waiting for over ten years to see this film released on the DVD format, so as to serve the purpose of restoring this gem of art to the level it deserves. Now that that time has come upon us, I have nothing left to say but........it was well worth the wait."	5.0	The Ten-Year Wait Has Been Well Worth	2004-01-17	2	1	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1V3TRGWOMA8LC	"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time"""	Like many cinematic masterpieces, it's not possible to summarize this film in a TV-guide style and portray any sense of its monumental achievement. I'm not going to describe its content but it's a film that every person should watch as a lesson for not just where true evil can lead, but also how hope, honesty and humanity offers redemption.It's even more of a testament to Steven Spielberg that he was reviewing FX reels of Jurassic Park in between filming sequences for this, since ever shot is vital to the film and perfectly crafted. It's also one of the few films that warrant buying a home theater system for - you simply won't believe the difference when viewing on a large LCD screen with surround sound.I originally saw this three times at the movie theater, which is a major commitment for a 4-hour film. I've also seen it several times on cable and accidentally ended up watching the whole thing. It's simply one of the most compelling films ever made and, as a piece of art, grabs you from the very beginning to the very end.---PS - As an aside, I once saw this in the theater in London where a bunch of skinheads were at the front making constant derogatory comments and slurs. About 25 minutes in, a jumbo-sized container full of Coke whizzed passed my ear and hit one of them on the squarely on the back of the head, knocking him unconscious on the floor. The whole theater erupted with cheers and applause, and it's one of the most satisfying acts of swift justice I've ever witnessed!	5.0	Probably the greatest movie ever made	2008-08-28	2	1	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AL5OEDM8TPTKV	James Hiller	"Back in 1993, I watched this film a total of two times. Once in the theater, and once on video when it was released. After just two viewings, I knew that I was watching not only a classic, but a film that was incredibly deep and complex. It became my fourth favorite film of all time. Schindler's List is nothing short of amazing; it's a film for which films were made.Steven Spielberg took Thomas Keneally's book and adapted into it a film exposing the horror's of the Holocaust, while at the same time, giving us a candle of hope. Oskar Schindler, a somewhat lecherous character, starts out associating with the Nazi's to further his business career, to make money. But soon, he's drawn into the plight of the Jews of Poland, and soon conspires to start saving as many of them as possible. Through his machinatons, Schindler was able to manipulate a system totally out -of-control, and work within it to rescue people who have no hope of controlling their futures.One of the first images we see of intolerance occurs when the Jews in Poland are forced to relocate to the Warsaw Ghetto. Spielberg premonates the horror by having a little girl stand alongside the people carrying their belongs screaming ""Godobye Jews! Goodbye Jews"" as other children pelt the people with dirt and rocks. Spielberg slowly builds the atrocities to allow us to experience it, and take it in. Just when you think it couldn't get worse, it does. It's shocking, but necessary to watch: shooting people without reason, poisioning hospital patients to save them from being slautered, the separation of families. It is not easy to watch, but watch you must.Embedded in this movie are the stories of many of the Survivors. There are many small details that make this extremely real, and personal. From hiding jewelry in bread and swallowing it, to having a little boy save a mother and her daughter, these are stories that would have been lost had it not been for Spielberg or Keneally.Both Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes turn in performances that are extraordinary. Especially Fiennes, who plays Amon Goeth, a vicious Nazi who has completely lost his humanity.Schindler, in the middle of it all, makes his attempt to pull as many people from his situation as possible. Through his courage, deceit, and intelligence, Schindler manages to save many people, but he worries, not enough. This film has one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen in any film, impossible to watch with a dry eye.This is a film that everyone simply must see, and learn from it, so that we may never have to make a film like this, again."	5.0	The List is Life	2004-03-09	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A22EZCYC84XJRT	James & Katie	"Schindler's List is about the Holocaust and a man named Oskar Schindler who became an unlikely hero during to the Jews.  Throughout the movie we see the progression of the war and the changes that occur for Jewish families in Germany and Poland.  Schindler seems to possess psychic abilities as he moves to this area with the intent of capitalizing on the war.  He speaks with a Jewish businessman and accountant names Itzhak Stern, who is also a valued member of the Jewish community, about potential investors in his ideas.  Stern helps Schindler obtain investors and initiate his business.  Schindler purchases a metal factory and with the advice of Stern begins to run the factory using solely Jews for laborers.  Stern helps arrange for important members of the community to get jobs at this factory, as those who are working are safe from being removed from the ghettos at that time.  Eventually a labor camp is established nearby and the factory workers are forced to begin working under the Nazi commander Goth.  Goth is very brutal and the Jews are killed for the slightest thing under his leadership.  Schindler befriends Goth and is able to keep an eye out for Stern who he appears to care for deeply, taking him food from a party one time.  When Goth is notified to close his labor camp and send his workers to Auschwitz.  Schindler convinces Goth to allow him to purchase his workers in order to open his own factory in his hometown.  Goth allows him to make a list of the people that he wants, and Schindler and Stern make a list of all the people they can think of.  Schindler has to rush to Auschwitz and is able to bribe the head SS officer to allow him to take ""his"" Jews after a misdirection of the women's train.  We learn the Schindler has no intentions of really producing ammo for the war, but actually only protecting the Jews.  Schindler uses all the money he has made to support the workers and bribe Nazi officials.  Just as Schindler's money is about to run out, the Germany army surrenders.This film depicts scenes of family worship during the Nazi occupation of Poland.  It shows scenes of the families praying prior to eating.  There is also a scene from the train station that depicts the important belongings the Jews have chosen to bring with them, there are multiple menorahs and other religious items on the shelves along with clothing and jewelry, displaying how important religion was to them.  After the Jews are moved to Schindler's factory, he allows them to observe the Sabbath and practice their religion more openly.  Before he leaves the Jews at the factory, they give him a ring with a quote from the Talmud that states, ""He who saves the life of one man, saves the world entire.""  This was to show their appreciation to him, but it also shows their religion as they incorporate it into their gift."	5.0	Schindler's List	2010-04-18	3	0	3

Spielberg put all of his heart behind this and it really shows. From the acting, to the directing, to the scarring images of the concentration camps, this is without a doubt a landmark achievement. The ending is just about the saddest ending ever. You will let a tear out of your eye, even if you are a hard hearted old man. Oskar Shindler (Liam Neeson) is a very rich man, stuck in the middle of the holocaust, as a Nazi. He took every cent he had to make sure that over 1,000 ""Jews"" would not die at the hand of Adolph Hitler and the Nazi. He literally went bankrupt just to save the lives of these people, who did nothing wrong, but because of their relegion were massacered in the thousands because that ignorant S.O.B Hitler wanted to rule the world. To see this and not weep should be a sin. I hope that everyone else feels the same way. I absolutely cannot wait for this DVD to be released, (hopefully it will have a ton of extra features).""This pen, this pen right here, could have saved two more lives.

Spielberg tells this Holocaust tale of an unexpected hero with a surprising mix of beauty and horror. Filmed mostly in black and white, the movie is at times tough to watch, but this is because of its raw power and ability to transport you to a part of world history that many would like to forget but cannot (nor should they).This is definitely Spielberg's greatest film.

Blood money:  Why should any organization, person, distributor profit by marketing stories about genocide?  I don't see anyone marketing stories about the American Indian Holocost, the Holocost of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, nor Stalins Holocost of 20 million countrymen.  Why is this particular sliver of history written and broadcast again and again, but other historical events are ignored entirely?  Same question goes for cop/lawyer/investigative/who-do-it TV broadcasts that dominate network television.2. Frustrating:  Why didn't these people fight back?  Why not die fighting and at least take out a few enemies on the way out?  This is more a story about the demise of ""Fish in the Barrel""and ""Kittens In the Drowning Bag"".3. Relevance:  The Nazi pograms Did NOT Happen IN THE UNITED STATES.  American history is not European history.  So why is this stuff marketed daily to American consumers???  Why didn't they build the Washington D.C. Holocost Museum in Europe (Poland in particular), where Europeans can learn about their own history WHERE IT HAPPENED??  Why are these DVDs on every retail shelf when I can't even find DVDs about the American Revolutionary War in my local store?I suspect the answer to all questions resolve to three simple explainations: Money, Money, and Money.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A960I9P90RVAM	J. Cohen	Schindler's List is based on a true story that occurred during the Holocaust.  Leading up to and during World War II Jews living within Nazi occupied areas that were not sent to concentration camps were often forced to work as slave labor in many military and non-military capacities.This story is about the approximately 1100 Jews that were sent as forced labor to work in a factory owned by Oskar Schindler, an opportunistic and greedy Czechoslovakian businessman and a member of the Nazi party.  Unlike the majority of Nazi party members Schindler did not have a particular animosity toward the Jews.  Schindler's interest was in being a powerful and wealthy businessman.  Being a member of the Nazi party and using Jewish slave labor was a means to an end for him.  Schindler's lack of humanity was due in part to the prevalent feelings of anti-semitism that were widespread in Europe prior to World War II (as in other times) and also due to Schindler's lack of personal contact with the Jews that were being persecuted.  It was this personal contact during their internment as his labor force that broadened Schindler's view of the Jews and of the reality of Nazi propaganda, and their final solution to exterminate the Jewish race.  Even though Schindler's eyes opened to the evils of the Nazis, there was little he could do under the Nazi rule to change the fate of the 1100 Jews who would ultimately be sent to the concentration camp, Auschwitz, and exterminated.  Now with a new moral compass and using the same business acumen that had brought him his wealth, Schindler arranges to buy the Jews in his factory from the Germans in order to save them from death.  Under the guise of wanting to move them to a factory in his hometown, Schindler uses his personal fortune to purchase as many Jews as he can afford.  This subterfuge is not easy and he must use all his wits to save a group of Jewish women and children that are accidentally sent to Auschwitz.Even though this story is told through a single individual's view of the Holocaust, it represents the mindset of the time throughout much of the world.  Prior to the Holocaust anti-semitism and prejudice towards Jews was common and widespread but in most places the violence against Jews was sporadic and killing Jews was not systematic.  Jews had been used as scapegoats throughout their history.Most people were unaware of the events of the Holocaust until after the war was over.  For those that did hear about the enslavement and mass killings of millions during the war years, most could not believe that it was possible.The final realization of the Holocaust lead Jews in the pursuit to gain their own homeland, Israel, and to becoming much less likely to let anti-semitism stand without challenge.	5.0	Schindler's List	2013-04-14	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"Steven Spielberg never met a human emotion he couldn't trivialize on film. Applied to the Holocaust, this inability to convey deep and complex feeling should have sunk this film. Luckily for us all, Spielberg was delivered from cinematic ignominy by a superb cast and story.Spielberg uses ""Schindler's List"" to tell the story of the saving of hundreds of Jews by one man, and the Shoah in general. While I commend him for taking on this difficult and important subject, he is the wrong man for the job. Spielberg often shows us scenes that should horrify us, but don't. Watching the Nazis line up a group of Jewish men, then shoot into them should convey the helplessness of the Jews and the sadism of the Nazis. Instead, by preventing his cast from interacting with the scene, he allows it is to play without emotion. Spielberg's fascination with shooting people in the head becomes more a study in the ways that human bodies react to being pierced by bullets than a study of the grotesqueries and randomness of genocide.Liam Neeson's portrayal of Oskar Schindler is what gives this movie the weight and heft that otherwise elude Spielberg. Neeson's Schindler is a rich, charming goy, willing to go with the political flow to make a few more dollars from whichever regime happens to be in power. Neeson does underplay Schindler's roguishness, I believe, which is a bit of a disappointment and an inaccuracy. He is already a *mensch* when the film starts and doesn't have far to go in his transformation in the face of Nazi horror. Yet his basic humanity, which eluded so many others during the war, allows him to save many.""Schindler's List"" succeeds because of its story and on the performances of its cast. Liam Neeson, as noted, is superb. Ben Kingsley is masterful in his portrayal of bookkeeper Itzhak Stern. Ralph Fiennes delivers a cool and controlled portrait of German commandant Amon Goeth. This was a movie that had to be made. Though Spielberg was not the ideal man to direct it, better to have an imperfect depiction of the Holocaust than none at all."	4.0	Out of his depth, yet Spielberg delivers	2004-10-12	7	4	3

I thought this until this  past month in which our history teacher had us watch the movie in class.  What I first thought was going to be a boring movie, turned out to be one  of the most emotional movies that I have ever seen.  The job that Steven  Spielberg did in this movie is just beyond words.  The acting by Liam  Neeson and also Ralph Fiennes was also superb.  Fiennes's character  especially, you just loved to hate, but I later had pity for during the  film.  To this date, I have never seen a film that was so real.  I was not  the only one in my class touched by this classic. The emotion of the final  seen in which the real survivors and actors place stones on Oskar  Schindler's grave kept us in our seats even after our class bell rang.  We  all knew we'd be late to the next class, but this movie just kept us there  until the end.  If that doesn't tell you how powerful this movie was, then  I don't think anything will.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2DBBXMV6GS3CL	"""jeffrub7"""	"Masterfully Directed, Vividly Depicted, and brimming with emotion and history, Stephen Spielberg's Schindler's List is a pure work of genius and a sobering look at a horrible time and realm of human history - early twentieth century Europe and the Holocaust.  From frame one to its powerfully climactic conclusion, the film running 184 minutes long evokes for over three hours the viewers very humanity while tracing the life of one man - Oskar Schindler (Liam Nisen) in his experience and development throughout the war.  It is a work of absolute grandeur and historic retelling, important both in its subject and delineation of a horrible time in human history.  The film is hauntingly presented with a recurring theme of John William music that serves to draw the whole together and cast an eerie loom of darkness throughout the film.  It is disturbingly open in its depiction of people place and events, a movie worth much more than most of its kind, inspired, and truthful.The film traces one man, historically based Oskar Schindler in his development throughout the war - World War II - and Holocaust.  He is an unique individual, oven shown in the light of a hero, yet humanized by his own flaws among which alcoholism, womanizing and personal greed dominate.  Not the immediate figure the viewer will identify as a hero, nor the modest gentle soul that he is often associated with, Oskar Schindler is a man in the war to make money and become rich, Jews, Nazis, conflict all foreign and unimportant aspects to an ultimate goal of success.  A tall and built man that rises above the rest in his audacity and determination, not to mention collective and sociable character, Schindler is throughout the film a continual conflict to himself and his aspirations for success.  A likable character that undergoes profound change throughout the film, Schindler becomes the hero the title of the movie suggests having given up his wealth and livelihood to save a few insignificant Jewish live ands having in the end played the Nazis for his own benefit.Yet, the film is most important in the way it depicts Oscar Schindler overall, as a well adapted man to war, and resourceful entrepreneur.  He is popular and well liked, with high ranking powerful friends, and the wealth to enjoy all the benefits of social mobility and bribery in a time the world has seemed to have fallen apart.  He is an impeccable character in impeccable dress, openly a member of the Nazi party, yet increasingly opposed - if on a personal level - to Nazi atrocities.  Nonetheless aimed at success, he is a able to culminate mild relationships with authorities to gain favors, all the while determined to exploit the war and the Jews for cheap labor.However, Schindler's ingenuity truly lies in his prowess at forming relationships and skill at scheming.  Able to effectively exploit the Nazis in an increasing way throughout the film, he forms his industry under the work and experience of Jewish Itzhak Stern who played by Ben Kingsley formulates Schindler's business as a way to save his fellow Jews from a certain death.  Stern recruits and aims at Jews most likely to be the target of Nazi anti-Semitism and cruelty, while providing for Schindler ""skilled"" labor, in order to generate his aspired wealth.  However, above all Stern's relationship to Schindler as a Jew targeted by the party Schindler is openly a member is something of great importance to the film.  Not only does he serve to change Schindler from a entrepreneur bent on success to a humanitarian solely caring for his Jews, but he seems to embody the whole of Jewish suffering from an indirect point of accountant.Based on the Holocaust however, the film does in an important way depict this horrible historical event.  Whether it be through Spielberg's on-site filming at - Auschwitz and Schindler's factory among the notable others -  or the horrible depiction of human suffering and cruelty focused in haunting black and white, the film adequately shows for perhaps the first time in Hollywood cinematography the true atrocities of the Holocaust and its effects on people.  Focusing even more directly on a Nazi labor camp commandant Amon Goeth and his representation of absolute evil and depravity the film shows a man take Jews as target practice, kill twenty-five men for the actions of one, and devastatingly destroy the whole world of a people and one girl - Helen Hirsch - whom he falls in love with ironically, sparing only on his impulse of false affection.  Regardless, in the end he is depicted as the ultimate atrocity, the manifestation of Nazi evil, and a symbol of the more widespread and horrible atrocities that made up the Holocaust.Above all a genius work of cinematography, acting and screenplay (Steven Zaillian) Schindler's List is not a celebration of people or history, but a solemn tale of darkness and depravity, outlining one of humanity's most dark and disturbing periods.  It is a wonderfully crafted and depicted work, based on the novel of Thomas Keneally, it is hauntingly open in its depiction of Holocaust conditions and personal experiences.  Its final powerful conclusion of a generation united with the survivors of the human atrocity is an exceptional and powerful conclusion to an phenomenal film, that ends in honor of Oskar Schindler and to all those who perished in the Holocaust.  In the end however, the film leaves you in amazement and awe, the slow tune of William stirring in the depths of your mind evoking memories of a film that seems too realistic and harsh to be even remotely true.  It leaves the forcible impression of suffering and heroism, and a important reminder of human good. ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire,"" the tagline of a momentous movie and catastrophic story, of a devastated people and changed man - Oscar Schindler."	5.0	An Unforgettable Work	2002-04-29	10	8	2

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1F4FHBZ9UEEK8	Jeremy Shelton	"In the beginning of the movie, Oscar Schindler exhibits the traits of a ruthless, deceitful, and inconsiderate individual as he attaches his NAZI pin to his multi-layered jacket.  However, as the movie proceeds, the kind-hearted nature of Oscar Schindler is divulged, along with his altruistic actions.  The movie ""Schlindler's List"" takes place in the German occupied territory of Poland during World War II.  During the early parts of the war, Oscar approaches a Jewish man named Izak Khan with a strategic business proposal.  His proposition, which was only implementable with Khan's financial support, was to establish an industrial enterprise.  This particular enterprise would manufacture the finest crockery for the German armies.  After Khan consents, Schindler demands a skilled and capable Jewish workforce.  At first, these were the only type of individuals that were permitted to work at the factory.  However, as more and more of the Jewish people came to him for salvation, he was forced to choose between saving money or saving people .  As stated earlier, this is where the kind-hearted nature of Oscar Schindler only enlarges.  From that moment on, he opened his doors up to more and more of the Jewish people, hence saving them from death.  At the end of the movie, the Jews commend him and his eyes are drowned in joyful tears.This particular movie is an exemplification of why it is immoral to persecute a group of people because of their beliefs.  It shows the good nature/kind-heartedness of both sides and how their decisions are limited by a ruthless and dictatorial ruler (Hitler).  In reference to all religions, it shows all of us that the only way to obtain earthly liberation is by bonding together with love and using the interfaith dialogue.  For the Jewish people, the Holocaust is commemorated with a national holiday known as Yom Hashoah, which is held on the 27th of Nissan.  To them, it represents a substantial loss of their own kind and how they must strive to retain their own people/beliefs.  To others, the Holocaust represents an era that should only be revisited in memory.  Overall, it makes us aware of who WE are as people.  And most importantly, how we can all resolve conflict by collaborating,irrespective of religion or ethnicity."	5.0	"""The Haven for all Jews"""	2011-04-24	0	0	0

It is an inspired work that I found to be touched by the hand of God.  Despite the backdrop of the Holocaust, I was exhilerated rather than depressed by the experience.  It is a triumphant story of good over evil.One reviewer lamented that this is not the type of film one would want to view more than once, so why buy the DVD?  However, when this film was released, I watched it every weekend while it was in my local theater.  Watching it again became the thing that I most wanted to do each weekend.  I am thrilled that it is available on DVD.  I hope one day that Spielberg will realize the importance for him to record commentaries for his films.  This film certainly deserves one, but I am not holding my breath.	5.0	A Divine Film	2004-01-10	8	6	2
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A32LR27V9CW2IA	J. Hicks	Recently, with much care and apparent guidance, the Spielberg film catalog is coming out on Blu-Ray. In the past few months we've really enjoyed how fantastic films like ET and Raiders look on Blu-Ray, and Schindler's List is no exception.The film restoration looks gorgeous, and even though the film is largely in black and white, the enhancements accentuate Kaminski's gorgeous cinematography. The Blu-Ray has sufficient grain to remind us of film but resolution that shows in the contrast of the blacks and the details of expression that we usually can see only on the big screen. I did have one pixelated moment with a movement of Embeth Davidtz' hand in one scene, but that was it.The performances stand out as fresh as they did 20 years ago - Fiennes is a revelation, Ben Kingsley is perfect, and Liam Neeson gives a performance of a lifetime. His final scene as he leaves the factory will reduce the most stoic among you to tears.When I first saw the film, like many I was overwhelmed by the story and imagery. On seeing it again, I was moved by the gentle humor, and the touches of beauty scattered throughout the film, courtesy of Zaillian's script and  Spielberg's heart.While Saving Private Ryan is a remarkable achievement in film-making, the story line always felt a bit cartoonish to me. Schindler's List is both masterful and moving,  intimate and complete.Absolutely worth owning as a Blu-Ray disc.	5.0	Gorgeous	2013-03-06	4	3	1

Hudgens	"I cannot for the life of me think of what the point was behind the scene where a supposed gas chamber actually turns out to be a shower room.  Is Spielberg implying that the mass murder of Jews in Auschwitz never happened? Probably not, but this scene can definitely be interpreted that way. The only conclusion I can come up with is that Spielberg intended to convey some form of relief for his audience, but since the gassings of Jews and other ""undesireables"" was pretty much the cornerstone of the Holocaust, it seems to me that he just copped out.  Granted there were other scenes that were difficult to watch, but if he wanted to create an accurate historical document, by some accounts, he should've portrayed the unfathomable horror of a gassing.  However difficult that might've been I'm sure the audience would've gotten the message.  This movie fails because of this scene."	1.0	Terrible	2005-11-20	79	5	74

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2FOHLHG8YH0QW	Jill Thornton	I watched Schindler's List several weeks ago, but many of the images still keep coming back to me because it is a very powerful movie that stays with you.  I can recall vividly as the young Jewish engineer was shot because she had the gall to suggest a change in the construction of a building.  I can still see the scene where Schindler tricks the commander into spray the hot cattle cars with water so the Jews trapped inside could get a little relief.  There are many more scenes that will stay with me for years to come.I first viewed Schindler's List to show to my advanced English as a Second Language high school class after they had read Anne Frank:  A Diary of a Young Girl.  I knew that it would help them get a deeper understanding of World War II and its atrocities.  I was right.  From the moment the movie began, the students were mesmerized by this film.  They didn't even complain that it was in black and white.  The horror the film depicted kept them interested and wondering how and why such a thing as the Holocaust could ever have occurred.  The film made an impression on them. When we resumed watching the last part of the movie after Spring Break, I asked them if any of them had thought about the film over the break and some of them had. It's not always that high school students will admit to mulling over something that they have been doing academically!I believe that this film tells volumes about the Holocaust that sometimes history books just cannot make real for students.  I recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to be moved by the wonder of humanity (as in such a man as Oskar Schindler) and to anyone who wants to help others understand the atrocities of the Holocaust so that such a thing may never happen again to anyone.	5.0	A Film to Remember	2005-04-15	5	4	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3C2194TO8KM28	J. Klein	Overall i think this film is worthy to own, i already have it on vhs and have been waiting for the DVD version. But in reading some earlier reviews i find myself agreeing with some of the film's detractors:- the final factory scene/schindler's farewell are far too syrupy, it's almost embarassing to watch.- there are certainly some drawn out sections in this film, a lot of time is spent on the relationship between goeth and his maid. and i'm not exactly sure why, we already know what kind of person goeth is by everything else he has done. why develop his character on this one point and leave out more important ones?- there are quite a few scene and shot steals in this movie from previous works, i have a list of my own, but some other reviewers  have pointed out some additional ones.- remember this is a piece of drama, not a historical document. there are better teaching tools in history books and testimonials rather than cinema.In response to those who have complained that S-berg leaves out certain aspects of history, i think we need to remember that the story is simply about 'Schindler's List' and thus he really has no obligation to tell us everything that happened during the time period. Although, if you are paying attention, since the story is set in Krakow, those must be polish citizens thowing stones while the jews are being marched into the ghetto.. as is the boy drawing his finger across his throat as a train heads into auschwitz.Finally, in goeth's speach during the camp's opening, i found it ironic that he would state that jews had been in krakow for 700 years, and that that presence was coming to an end. Not too far from Krakow is Breslau, a city that was thoroughly german for 700 years until the end of the war when it was emptied of its population (along with the rest of german Silesia) during the largest ethnic cleansing in europe's history.	3.0	Certainly not perfect	2004-03-09	17	1	16

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2E395RTUODWVF	Jlpratt	For some people that would see this movie they might think that it doesn't really portray the way the Holocaust really was during World War II my opinion is that if it wasn't it still was a great movie to watch and actually it was my first time viewing it. This movie was one of Steven Spielberg's greatest masterpieces. Schindler's list which lasted all of three hours is factly based on the Holocaust nightmare that took place during Hitler''s reign in World war II. The movie is based on Oskar Schindler (a German buisinessman who takes the opportunity to make money off the Nazis' rise to power). It starts by someone's hand lighting a pair of candles. This movie was basically in black and white although this scene offered a small amount of color to it. Our first view of Schlindler is in a hotel room at first you don't know it's him but his jewels are shown and a large wad of money in which he puts on and in his pocket. As the movie progresses Schindler visits the Jewish council to carry out Nazis orders. as he walks in front of Jews he meets his accountant Itzhak Stern and tells him that he needs Jews (he called them investors)to help him purchase a factory. He doesn't want to pay the Jews with money as he convinces them to accept goods because he tells them that money will be no good in the ghetto. The factory gets set up by Schindler with the help of Stern and they commence to hire Jews because they are cheap labor. These jobs would help Jews from being in death camps and Stern knew this because he was trying to survive also.Meanwhile in 1942 Jews were assigned to the Plaszow labor camp which was controlled by Amon Goeth (a Nazi who was an alcholic and treachorous person) who killed prisoners quite often. The destruction has started and Schindler recognized it when he and his girlfriend view a little girl in a red coat (another color scene in the movie)walking thru. Schindler begins to feel sorry for the Jews and eventually lures Goeth to allow him to build his own camp to house his Jewish workers.Schindler begins to think about saving Jews after a girl named Regina begs him to hire her parents because she has heard that the factory was a pleasent place to work. A little later in the movie Goeth is charged with evacuating Plaszow and exhuming and burning of some 10,000 bodies of Jews that were killed in the ghetto. Schindler realizing that his workers and Stern would be facing death decided to spend his money to attempt to save as many Jews as possible. He eventually would persuade Goeth to sell him his workers and also his maid. He would have to buy the women workers twice because rather them being transported together they were split up from the men and were taken elsewhere. They would be reunited and remain in Czechaslovakia until World War II ended. At this point as Germany has fallen, Schindler also has lost his fortune but he saved over 1,100 Jewish lives from what we call the Holocaust.This movie relates to World Religions in the fact that it is based on the horrendous Holocaust. Schindler's List exposed many to the fact of the suffering and deaths of Jewish women, men, and children. After World War I Adolf Hitler put the blame on the Jews for Germany's problems. Religion played it's part because many Jews died but their beliefs were not in vain.	4.0	Schlinder's List	2012-11-15	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AG3SDQQL5TISC	J. Martin	"Schindler's ListSchindler's List was a very compelling film of how a man saved 1,100 Jews from being put to death in the gas chambers in Auschwitz Germany.  The three main characters are Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth and Ben Kingsley as the accountant for Oskar Schindler.In 1939 the Germans defeated the Polish Army.  Jews were ordered out of their homes and told to register all family members.  Thousands of Jews arrived in Krakow daily.  The Germans treated the Jews as if they were animals.  They were shot, sexually abused, beaten, paraded around nude, laughed at and put to death in gas chambers.  Schindler came in wanting to make money, knowing that he would profit immensely, for he could work the Jews and not have to pay them a dime.  Throughout the movie you could tell that Schindler did not approve of what was happening and appeared to be growing fonder of his workers.  He fought for and stood up for the Jews many times.  In 1944 Amon Goeth was ordered to exhume and incinerate the bodies of more than ten thousand Jews.  Once Schindler became aware of this atrocious act, he then asked to buy all the factory workers.  Schindler made his list, fought for the lives of the women and children, and then he spent all the money he made to keep his factory running. At the end all the Jews had written a letter on his behalf telling what had happened and how Schindler saved their lives.  With the letter, they gave him a silver band with an inscription from the Hebrew Bible, ""Whoever saves one life, save the world entire"".  They told him, ""There will be more generations because of what you did"".  Schindler sobbed for he felt he didn't do enough.  There are more than six thousand descendants of the Schindler Jews.  In 1958 Schindler was declared a righteous person by the council of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem and invited to plant a tree in the Avenue of the Righteous.  It grows there still today. Schindler died September 10, 1974 and his grave is visited by the Schindler Jews and their descendants yearly.During the Holocaust there were almost six million European Jews murdered by the Nazi leadership of Germany during the World War II.  In the culture of Greco-Roman, anti-Semitism has played a part in Europe since the Roman Empire adopted Christianity as its state religion in the fourth century CE (Fisher 264).  After the defeat of Germany in World War I, Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party blamed the Jews for all of their problems.  From 1939 to 1942 the Jews was deprived of all human rights.  By the end of the Holocaust they were being starved, worked to death as slaves, tortured, ""experimented"" on and shipped to extermination camps where they were placed in industrial size gas chambers (Fisher 265).  To the Jewish belief it poses the question, ""Is God omnipotent and caring?""(Fisher 266).*Fisher, Mary Pat.  ""Living Religions"".

Moon ""oddjoce"""	"SPOILER ALERT - Don't read this if you don't want any spoilers!This movie starts with a member of the SS party named Oskar Shindler. He has one purpose in life and that is to live richly. He takes advantage of the Jews lot in life under German rule to open a manufacturing facility.This movie leaves nothing to the imagination and I suspect that is the way director Steven Spielberg wanted it. You see the coldness of it all. A man, and worker for Shindler, is shot in the head for having one arm. Shindler thinks of this more as a business man one worker lost and therefore one more to hire and train. It isn't until his workers are all driven to concentration camps that the reality of what is happening to the Jews really strikes Oskar.The SS in this movie appear to have no heart. They don't view Jews as humans but rather as rodents. They think nothing of killing them, even the children. In the camps the Jews are humiliated by beatings and forced public nudity. They are shot ""arbitrarily"" as Oskar puts it. Such awful scenes led ""some Jews to complain to God in anguish"" (Fisher 275). Many Jews continued to hope for better times just as occured for the biblical Job. God allowed Satan to take everything from him, but he was rewarded for his suffering when God replaced everything. Their enduring hope was shown in the Jewish prayer recited in the beginning and end of the movie.Throughout the movie Shindler moves to protect ""his"" Jews by listing them as ""necessary workers"". He tries through reasoning and cunning to save as many lives as possible even putting himself in harms way to do so. In the end Shindler saves 1000 Jews by enlisting them as workers. He allows and encourages them to engage in thier religious celebrations including allowing them to leave their jobs early on Friday to prepare for Passover. Passover is the Jewish Sabbath taking place ""from sunset Friday night to sunset Saturday night, because the Jewish ""day"" begins with nightfall"" (Fisher 277).  Oskar's actions toward the end of this film show that some SS members did have a heart and that not all hopeful Jews would be let down.Works Cited:Fisher, Mary Pat. Living Religions (7th Edition).

Levine ""Jlevine"""	A monument to Spielberg and all who participated...Zillian, Neeson, Kingsley, and especially, Ralph Finnes....No single film yet made has captured the singular nature of the  programmatic and State directed murder of millions. It occured with the complicity of many, resisted by only a few who were indeed righteous. The ease with which this occured in full view was breathtaking. So many benefited from the removal of Jews from the society. Apartments were taken, jobs filled, possessions treated as spoils of an uncivil war. What makes this so important is its constancy. Hatred of Jews existed before and persists after this film. To prove the point, and thus the import of this movie, I leave you with two facts. First, the far right wind RIght Sector, and its political compatriot , Svoboda, devotedly anti - Semitic and neo- fascist hold 3 cabinet postions in the new Kiev government. When confronted , the acting Prime Minister says that they are under control. He may think so but when the leading candidate for the upcoming election rose to calm a crowd of Ukrainian's besieging the &#34; sepratists&#34;, he was greeted by the worst opprobrium that they could muster....The called him a &#34; Jew&#34;.	5.0	To be treasured and remembered	2014-05-20	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3DFACTGT0FZJK	Joel	This movie is in my opinion, the most important movie of all time. This movie could be a social lesson about racism. I would hope that after viewing this movie, we could really all learn to get along. It is powerful, moving, and brillant. The realism of the Holocaust is shown with brutal honesty. From the scene where the children in the camps are removed by the terrified parents, to the women thinking they are in a gas chamber to realize they are actually in a shower room, Spielberg gives a glimpse of the horror of one of the most dark moments in humanity. The acting is all first rate. Liam Neeson gives a beautiful portrayal of a man who changes his view of &quot;his workers&quot;. From a entreprenuer who is seeking the bottom line to a man who is on a mission to save as many people as he can, Neeson captures the role. Ralph Fiennes gives a chilling performace. To play a man who does not care about the value of another human being that is not of his ilk...no words can describe it.From a critical standpoint, any other movie Spielberg does may make more money or be more popular, but THIS movie will be his artistic impression that is left in the industry. From a personal view, one of the final scenes when Schindler is leaving the plant and realizes he could have done more always touches me. This movie is a must for movie lovers.	5.0	The movie Spielberg could only make	2001-06-27	4	3	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1ZUCFMEWSDBMR	John Colville	Watching &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is a bit like identifying the remains of your child, or witnessing an execution. In a word, devastating. I happened to see this movie in a three-generation family group, at a theatre, and on leaving we witnessed a well-dressed, dark-haired, middle-aged woman exit the theatre, prop herself up against a utility pole and sob uncontrollably.  You don't witness a scene this after the average blockbuster like &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;.In the car on the way home, my father, a World War II veteran who was at the liberation of Belsen concentration camp, said &quot;The feeling I have is anger against the Germans ... I've seen the real thing and now I've had enough. No more for me.&quot; I recalled the little girl in the red coat, and tears involuntarily streamed down my face.You can read reviews, right here at this site, that testify to the widespread resentment of the Jews and their alleged conspiracy to steal everyone's money. &quot;The Jews control banking and the media&quot;, they argue. &quot;What about other massacres like the Alamo? Don't they count?&quot; As the late Jack Benny used to say, with the left hand propping the pensive right forearm, the other hand cradling the right side of his deadpan face: &quot;Could I have a moment to think about that?&quot;&quot;Schindler's List'' is carefully and expensively made propaganda; as such, it violates the creative principle of suspension of disbelief and is not a whole work of art, nor is it a documentary, like Leni Riefenstahl's &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. It is, like all of Spielberg's work, supremely manipulative, with outstanding performances by Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson, and an over-the-top, self-righteous performance by Ben Kingsley. The overall product leaves viewers with their emotions not only wrung out, but also strangely compromised, and very few are likely ever to watch it a second time. The medium of entertainment and the message of genuinely righteous anger do not play well together.	3.0	That's not entertainment	2004-07-20	16	6	10
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A10ODC971MDHV8	John Farr	While Spielberg's most serious, personal work is inevitably disturbing, it also constitutes important viewing. The director demanded painstaking authenticity, and achieves it in a variety of ways, shooting the film on location in period-appropriate black and white. Both Neeson and Kingsley are convincing, but Fiennes stands out as the embodiment of sadistic evil. Grim and graphic in places, the film faithfully tells a true story about a flawed man who transcends his sins with one sustained act of courage.	5.0	Schindler's List	2007-07-13	0	0	0

The 1939 to 1945's world is not a black and white world, it is a colored world instead. This black and white film looks like a documentary (WORLD AT WAR) which greatly reduced my interest in seeing it no matter how good its content is. If the film is colored, the German solders's uniform and other people's dressing or coat will be very attractive and beautiful look, and the film will be rated 5 stars.	2.0	Terrible Black and white film	2006-06-07	59	4	55
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A126JVOAOOR42V	John McConnell	"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List descends into hell but finds redemption. The black-and-white filming mutes the gore, as does the consistent light thread of black humor: Schindler (Liam Neeson) hires only young, shapely Jewish secretaries (who appear to type 15 wpm) - and he hires plenty; meantime, Isaac Stern (Ben Kingsley) busily tries to save the lives of highly educated-highly naive Jews by misrepresenting their liberal arts professions to the SS as ""skilled trades vital to the German war effort""; the lethal, menacing, sinister SS repeatedly tell Schindler what truly bothers them about his Jewish workers - ""It's just all the paperwork, you know, Herr Schindler""; later at Auschwitz Schindler rescues all his workers' children by brazenly (and quite convincingly) lying to the SS that only little children's hands can get inside 45 mm shell casings to polish them - making those little hands ""vital to the German war effort"".The sole splash of color in the entire film is the muted red jacket of a young girl four or five years old. Schindler sees her wandering through Cracow during the SS pogrom, and he sees her later again as a little red-jacketed corpse exhumed for cremation from an unmarked mass grave.Essentially an Ebenezer Scrooge morality play, we view Schindler's growth in Christian compassion. (Schindler was Roman Catholic.) Liam Neeson does a stellar job and his rapport with Ben Kingsley is magic. The pair move from chilly professional respect to warm against-all-odds friendship. This friendship is a counterpoint to Schindler's friendship with Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), the SS commandant in charge of Schindler's workers. Goeth ironically is more tragic than Stern, becoming day by day more and more of a cold-hearted brutalizer of the weak and helpless - as Schindler points out to Stern.The SS uniforms are immaculately correct, as is Spielberg's portrayal of the moral tide of anti-semitism throughout the war - initially rabid, later cold-blooded, finally matter-of-fact. His personal faults aside, Schindler's life was a beautiful testament of a glorious human soul surrounded by death and horror - and how that soul made a difference.A magisterial film that gets better with each viewing. Highly recommended."	5.0	Black and white film	2000-07-20	2	2	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AQ7V1UO19U1N9	John Rossi	"I don't even know what to say to begin this review, except this. This film is one of the best and most moving historical pieces that I have ever seen. Based on the novel by Thomas Kineally (I hope I spelled that right) this film is a powerful testament to the fact that one man can make an incredible difference in the lives of many people. In this case the man in question is Oskar Schindler, a Nazi Party member and war profiteer.I cannot find enough praise to ladle onto this film. The screenplay by Steven Zallian is absolutely first-rate stuff. But you need GOOD actors to pull off any script and make it work.Enter Liam Neeson. I had not heard of him until I had seen DARKMAN (1990) and thought that in that case he saved a film with his compelling performance. He absolutely BLEW me AWAY here. Oskar's change from a businessman who cared for nothing except money, profit, and his own public image to a compassionate humanitarian willing to throw away his last cent to save over 1,100 people's lives is heartwrenching, beautiful and inspiring. Liam pulls the role off with incredible skill and passion. Standing beside him as the PERFECT counterbalance is Ralph Fiennes as the German commandante Amon Goethe. This man is cold enough to make Jack the Ripper look like Charlie Brown. His eyes speak volumes of icy hatred without a word being spoken. And that voice...the quiet chill in it... is like molten magma boiling under the surface, just before it erupts with deadly fury. Goethe is a man that seems to give new meaning to the phrase ""less than human"". He is utterly frigid, merciless, and utterly compelling as the man you cannot help but cringe at in fear and hatred. My hat is off to Ralph Fiennes for doing such a wonderful job as one the screens most memorable and chilling villians. Ben Kingsley is also wonderful as Itzhak Stern, an ordinary man who ends up working for Schindler as his accountant and plays a pivotal role in the saving of the 1,100+ Jews on what becomes known as ""Schindler's List"". All of the actors and actresses involved in this film gave 100% believable and compelling performances here. There were quite a few moments in this film as I watched it for the the first time that there was not a dry eye anywhere in the theater.Kudos must also go to Steven Spielberg for his masterful and compassionate directing of this picture. I am THANKFUL this thing was shot in black-and-white. To see all that violence and attrocity in full color would have been overkill. The picture is violent and horrifying enough as it is. Plus the black and white filming gives the picture the feeling of a documentary, and I think that is exactly what Steven Spielberg wanted to do here. He did not want to ""create"" and tell a ""story"" He wanted to show people the horror of one of the blackest periods of time in human history. He wanted to be sure we were so transfixed by this that the lessons it tells will remain etched in our hearts forever. And he pulls it off quite wonderfully with room to spare.One final note of congratulations must be given here. I give that note with pride to Mr. John Williams, the composer of music that for years has touched the hearts of many generations of people. Rather than go with grand and scary cinematic music as he has in the past done, what John Williams did here is to make a score that is simple, very gentle, very elegant and absoulutely heartbreaking to hear. His use of the violin (masterfully played by Itzhak Perlman, KUDOS!) along with piano, flute, gentle strings and tragic but inspiring choir pieces and songs stands as perhaps the most heart-touching score in movie history. It perfectly captures the terrifying plight of a people facing extinction and the desperation and despair in their daily lives as they struggle to survive one of the darkest times in history that this planet and the human race has ever known.In short, this is a BEAUTIFUL, tragic, and ultimately grand picture that NEEDS to be seen. It WILL grab hold of your heart and MAKE you feel. It will make you think. It will make you shake your head and weep that humans be so cruel to one another. You will at the end weep again, in joy that one man had the courage to stand up and defy tyranny to save the lives of 1,100 people. If only we all had that kind of heart and that kind of courage.This is NOT a movie for young kids. As I have said before it is  very violent and tragic. It is however in the end beautiful and inspiring and heartwarming in a very real way. It is undoubtedly.... as the headline for my review says, one of the most POWERFUL movies of all time. Sit back and give it a look. The way you look at movies and life itself may never be the same again after you see this picture."	5.0	One of the most POWERFUL movies of all time.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AONVF6RGZHT0E	John Schmitt	I see Schindler's List as one of those movies that everybody should watch at least once in their lifetime. It might be difficult movie for some to watch, due to how disturbing and sad it is, but it is important that the Holocaust doesn't repeat itself (those who fail to learn history are doomed to repeat it). It's a movie that everyone at the high school I went to views before they graduate, and I hope that there are many more schools that do the same.The fact that the film is in black and white (for the most part) really draws the mood of the movie; sad and somber. If Spielberg filmed it in color, I do not think the mood would have been captured as well. Schindler's list while sad tells the incredible story of how one man stood up to one of the most evil regimes in world history and did what was right. Saved lives. I won't get into how he made money off it it, because it's not as important as saving the lives of innocent people. Once again I hope this is a film everybody sees at least once in their life. Taking a class about the Holocaust in high school, I became an advocate in hoping people take tie to learn about the Holocaust so such horrific event never occur again and watching Schindler's list is a piece to that puzzle.	5.0	An important lesson	2013-03-02	23	20	3
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1P2NBM3P3TS2X	"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason"""	There are at least three packaged versions of this film on DVD as of its release date:  Movie/extras only, movie/extras with souvenir book, and horribly overpriced collector's edition with &quot;sturdy&quot; yet irrelevant display case.  I bought the one with the souvenir book, primarily because it came at no additional cost over the movie-only version.The souvenir book is a throwaway item.  All it has is a few dozen stills from the film.  You thumb through it once, realize it is nothing special, then set it aside, never to pick it up again in all likelihood.The film, of course, is just shy of masterful.  The DVD release offers it in DTS sound, which makes a WORLD of difference in the enjoyment of the film.The disc is a &quot;flipper&quot;, as they are called by DVD afficianados.  A flipper is a disc that contains most of the movie on Side A and the conclusion on Side B.  You have to get up and flip the disc over during the course of the film.  Boo.  That feature was annoying enough (though almost always necessary) with LaserDiscs, but should not have to be a factor with DVDs.  [Actually, most higher-end LaserDisc players had 2-sided play -- the machine would scan the other side of the disc without you having to do anything but wait a few moments for the transition.  The only real drawback was having to change discs if the film's running time necessitated more than one disc]. Other films with the same running time as &quot;Schindler's List&quot; have fit comfortably on one DVD disc side for uninterrupted viewing.  I only know a tiny bit about technical specs and limitations on DVD disc space.  Perhaps it is the inclusion of the separate DTS track space that uses up too much of the disc side to fit the whole film onto Side A.  It CERTAINLY wasn't because of a director's commentary.  Spielberg hates those and has pretty much promised to never make one.The other footage/features on Side B are interesting but a bit lacking in quantity for what consumers have come to expect from high-profile DVD releases.Other reviewers have suggested that the &quot;flipper&quot; disc just comes off as being cheap and low-rent:  that perhaps a 2-disc set with nicely done artwork on the discs' cover side might have at least looked a bit more presentable and classy.I agree whole-heartedly.  I mean, if you're gonna have to use a second disc side to watch the film, at least a bit of physical &quot;production value&quot; to match the film's &quot;event status&quot; release would have nice.Not that there is anything too terribly WRONG with a flip-disc movie.  It's not the end of the world.  But by this point in DVD history, many customers have at least a minimum expectation of the aesthetic classiness of a disc's appearance.But we've come to expect this from Spielberg movies on DVD lately.  The &quot;Raiders&quot; trilogy was disappointingly anemic when it came to bonus features,  and only a few of those were less than 15 years old.  The wonderful LaserDisc box set collector's edition of &quot;Jaws&quot; in 1995 had a fascinating 2 hour documentary included, but the DVD release in 2001 saw it cut down to just over half that length.Still, it is great to have &quot;Schindler's List&quot; on DVD  --  get it in WIDESCREEN format everyone!  But don't buy it expecting a plethora of bonus features or bells and whistles.  They just aren't there.  There is, however, some Holocaust Survivor and Holocaust Foundation-related stuff included (the documentary stuff).  But that was included more for the purpose of pushing the director's message across rather than for the purpose of treating the DVD buyers to the fun and interesting treats that can come with the nifty DVD format.A great DVD release model for this film could have been any one of several New Line Cinema DVD releases that came out single or double disc and with tons of extras.

I enjoyed the movie when it was first released, I found it shocking, brutal and touching. I didn't really care for the character Schindler (I found him to be ruthless money grabber), but the characters revolving around him in the chaotic times of WWII was where I found the real depth of the movie.If everyone of our children watch ""Schindler's List"" and walk away with a true feeling of how precious life is, then I think we can stand proud as parents, and feel as if we have taught them something that they can teach their own children in the future. That war is war, nothing more, nothing less.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A35X1Q9RWGJAHS	Jonathan Fain	"Steven Spielberg made a lot of money out of his successful film, and yes, he also finally received an Oscar (Although I think some of his earlier work should receive one too). There are many interesting stories about the holocaust and WWII, and I wonder what attracted Spielberg to Schindler's story so much. Well, if you saw the film you can see that what Spielberg and Schindler have in common is money and ambition. Spielberg in my point of view is a great producer/business man. He knows how to make money (even for the Holocaust). I believe that is why Spielberg's so attracted to Schindler's character. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg has also values as well, and it is said that most of what the film has earned Spielberg donated to the Holocaust foundation. Spielberg is a franchise but I get the feeling that he cares. So in parallel to Schindler's character that evolves through the film, Spielberg uses the money he earns to make some good.Schindler is presented as a business man, who is interested in making money - actually a war profiteer. But something changes in his plan, Schindler learns slowly that the Nazi ideology is stupid and evil, and he goes on a process through the film of purging himself out of this ideology. He starts to care for ""his Jewish workers"", and by the end of the film he even cries, not for the loss of money, but for the life he could have saved.There are many scenes in this film, created in detail, through the help of survivor's testimonies. Some of them are extremely violent or contain nudity. Those scenes, which are shot brilliantly, are required for realism and I really like them, as I believe that such appalling violence is reserved only in film and not in our life.I find Schindler's List as a visual experience one should not miss, as it helps you grasp the horror and violence of the Nazis. Since Hollywood controls the world market of cinema, this movie is a breakthrough, bringing the story of the holocaust to the whole world."	5.0	A story that captures many aspects of the Holocaust.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1HDEDO0E29DB3	Jon Powell	I'm  not going to make a review of the movie itself because it's wonderful. That's as far as my praise for the DVD film will go however because the widescreen DVD is anything but. I bought my Widescreen copy not long ago and while watching the movie I always felt there was something wrong with the image. Sure enough there was. After I compaired the widescreen DVD to my old VHS full screen copy I discovered that the sides of the widescreen edition had no more image content than the VHS full screen and the top and bottom of the DVD widescreen had its image cut off. At least 20% of the top and bottom image was missing compaired to the VHS fullscreen. For example, the scene where Ralph Fiennes shoots a prisoner for stealing a chicken is telling. Right after he shoots the prisoner Fiennes is bending next to the boy who points out the chicken thief then stands straight up. On the VHS full screen we see all of Ralph Fiennes up to the rim of his hat. In the DVD widescreen we only see up to the top of Fiennes chest with his head missing completly. I can go on and on with examples and the outcome is the same. It looks as if the editors of the DVD had only a 4:3 image to work from and made the image look widescreen by cropping off the top and bottom. Universal should be embarassed for what they have done to a great movie and should fix this. I just wonder why no others have written about this.	2.0	"Beware of ""widescreen"" edition"	2005-11-28	25	16	9

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A35E4BHLC2HUIY	JorRN373	"Steven Spilberg's Schindler's List was an amazing movie in my opinion. Ever since grade school we have been educated on the Holocaust and the horrible slaughter of several Jewish individuals--men, women, and children. Some where killed lethally by gas in shower chambers, experimented on, shot, or tortured; then their bodies where burned and the ones still alive where made to pick up their bodies or shovel the ashes. That was something that  I thought was interesting, throughout the movie you think it's snowing. But you then find out, it's the ashes of burning flesh. That singular thought alone, made me sick on my stomach. Throughout the movie I shed tears because of the torment and disgusting torture they had to endure.  One of the best scenes, in my opinion, in the movie was when Schindler is standing in front of all the Jews he helped save, approximately 1100, and Stern hands him the ring they made from a Jewish man's teeth - with the engraving ""save one, save the world.""  Oskar looks at him and says ""I should have sold the car, or my ring, it would have saved several more.""  My eyes flooded with tears of passion and reaching out. Because a man, who sacrificed his own llife (if he had been caught) to save thousands still found room to criticize himself and found room for improvement.I personally know an individual who's great uncle was on Schindler's list. And he is alive today because of Oskar Schindler. That's absolutely astonishing to me. When you watch a movie, such as this one, you look at your life and say ""What can I do for others?""  or ""How is my life so bad?"" Wonderful movie, I would recommend to anyone -- even outside of educational purposes or personal attachment. :)"	5.0	Sensational Movie	2012-09-13	4	3	1

The holocaust was one of the darkest episodes in human history and this film does not hide any of the cruelty and the suffering that happened during that event.  Do I recommend this film?  I believe every person alive should see it in order to understand what we must prevent from ever occurring again.  This film is also about redemption, the redemption of Schindler and how a man can change during terrible circumstances.  This movie is a classic - Stephen Spielberg masterpiece and one of the most touching films ever made.	5.0	A powerful experience	2005-03-25	2	1	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3OH101U0CPUC7	Joseph Boone	"This movie follows the story of Oskar Schindler during WWII.  He starts off acting about as shallow and greedy as a man can be.  He uses Jewish labor in his factory because it's cheap and that's the beginning and end of his concern.  But this slowly changes through a combination of familiarity with his Jewish workers and the increasingly brutal treatment of Jews by the Nazi regime.  Schindler found something that seems to have been a true rarity in the Nazi empire, compassion for Jews and the conviction to do something about it.  For the sake of those who may not have seen the film, I will say no more about the plot.Schindler's List is not a ""fun"" movie to watch.  It's compelling, outstanding, powerful, and more... but not fun.  The film shows in fairly graphic detail (though it could have been worse) how Jews were systematically stripped of their homes, their possessions, and, finally, their lives.  The story is well told and carries an emotional impact that very few movies could ever aspire to.  The acting is top drawer all the way.  Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are almost always singled out, and their performances certainly merit praise.  But Ben Kingsley's quiet strength is essential to setting the tone for the Jewish people in the movie and the huge cast of no-names all do yeoman's work in establishing a believable recreation of what is almost certainly the most horrific event in human history.Steven Spielberg is a great director who has made some of the most successful movies in the history of the medium.  But none of his blockbusters deserve a higher place in history than Schindler's List.  It's difficult to watch in some respects due to the emotional impact but it's more than worth it.  If you've never seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to watch it at least once."	5.0	Hard to watch, but for all the right reasons	2007-09-30	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A15YPJLKLZS0MK	"Joseph Johnson ""brother/knight templar"""	A masterpiece that virtually swept the Oscars, Schindler's List will stand the test of time as one of the best movies ever made. For those unfamiliar with the movie, the title Schindler's List comes from the man Oscar Schindler who saved some Jews during World War II from the Holocaust. Of the survivors, that bloodline has Ingrid Pitt and Liam Neesan as the two most famous people who survived. Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany with his book, an autobiography called Mein Kampf, meaning My Struggle. He was quickly elected Germany's military and political leader, blaming the Jews for all of Germany's problems. Why the Jews? They had money and didn't spend it; they were horrible for the economy. To make a long story short, when the majority of a country's people are only spending weak sums on a holiday season, the value of the dollar inflates, driving up prices for every day things. Because the Nazis were worried about popular, they didn't show graphic detail. The Jews here were forced to strip naked and enter a shower, which emitted deadly gas. Others were put in concentration camps and forced to starve to death, more were burned alive in ovens. This movie brilliantly captures real events by a director who lost his sense of humor.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A34KBX6VF28QYN	Joseph Jordan	This is the film with which Spielberg broke his crowd-pleasing popcorn flick mold, and he did it in fine style.  In a way that few films since Welles' &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; have, Spielberg invents a new language for  film--grave, violent, steady.  It is an enormous film with an enormous  central character, and it takes an enormous actor to fill the role.  Liam  Neeson plays Oskar Schindler as a man of excesses who happens to also be  brave and compassionate beyond even his own expectations; it is a  performance of great subtlety and weight.  In my opinion, Neeson in this  film ranks with Brando in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; and De Niro in  &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;.  Spielberg finally won an Oscar, and though it  shouldn't have been his first (how can you deny &quot;Close  Encounters&quot;?), it is by far his most deserved.  Of course, it probably  helped his case that the film was about the Nazi Holocaust--if he'd  directed another film of this quality on a different subject, he probably  wouldn't have won--which doesn't mean he wouldn't have deserved to.	5.0	Spielberg's best	1999-09-16	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1TKM36EYEQNSM	Joseph J. Slevin	One is seized by the irony in this movie of the Schindler Jews who could die in concentration camps or be chosen to build war implements and related products for the German War Machine.I was stunned when I saw this movie because when I was a very young child I knew a Schindler survivor not understanding the seriousness at the time of what he suffered.  This movie will make you cry and make you think.  The music is engaging, between the violin solo at the start and the song Jerusalem of Gold at the end where there is a tribute to those who survived and died, how powerful the combination of sadness and sorrow.The movie is dark and being in Black and White, you feel the emptiness of the existence of prison life.  Finnes plays a rather heartless and cruel killer in the camp that is an ironic opposite of the open minded and tender hearted Schindler.  The irony and message in this movie seems to me to be that even though Germany of the day was controlled by an ideology so anti freedom and life, there existed many who did not agree with what was happening.There are many subtle lessons in this movie, Ben Kingsley is outstanding in this film.  Most of all, Liam Neeson is believable as the business man turned savior.	5.0	Sad Intesitiy, Horror and Emptiness	2004-03-08	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3OM2GM3W5W4HC	Joseph M	"This movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler during World War II. The movie starts out with him starting a company to build pots and pans for the army. With the help of a Jewish production manager, he creates a highly successful company that relies on the work of Jews in a Nazi ghetto in Krakow, Poland. He follows the Jews to a work camp, a concentration camp, and finally another work camp that makes bullets.  He makes a list with is production manager Itzhak Stern of people he ""needs"" for his factory. In reality he just wanted to help them live.There were many real people in this movie. The most important of these people is Oskar Schindler. He was treated with very good historical accuracy. One example of this is when he began worrying about the Jewish cause, after hiding Jews were killed. In the movie, the same thing occurs. He also saved the Jews who were mis-transported to Auschwitz instead of his factory. He does the same thing in the movie. However, he did not write the list as portrayed in the movie. Itzak Stern did. Another real character in this movie was Schindler's account, Itzhak Stern. He is also treated with remarkable historical accuracy. For example he ran the factory with essentially no input from Schindler in the movie and in real life and he saved the life of intellectuals in both. Some real events that occurred in the movie is the razing of the Krakow Ghetto and building Plaszow.The movie was set from 1939 to 1945. The city of Krakow, Poland was used. This setting was very realistic. The ghetto looked like a slum and the inhabitants despised the Jews. Another setting used was Plaszow. The set looked small compared to what the camp actually looked like. However, the buildings looked similar. Auschwitz looked like all the pictures I found, including the large chimney. The time span covered was 6 years. The furnishings were bare, as espected in a concentration camp. The clothes and hairstyles were also right. One prop I thought was used remarkably well was the railroad cars. The cars were crowded, dirty, and hot/cold (depending on the weather). Another prop used well was the factory. The methods used in the factory are old fashioned and not the most efficient way of doing things.I think Liam Nelson and Ben Kingsley did a great job. They both were very realistic. The actor who played the Nazi commander, Ralph Fiennes, overacted a little. The plot moved very slow.  The Nazi violence was shown again and again. This really happened, but does not get the viewer sadder as time goes on, but mad at the Nazis. The Jews in this movie are stereotypical. Almost all of the ones displayed are Hasidic and shrewd businessman. Although the second half of this statement is true in many cases, most Jews are not both.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AZLTX9S3J5FA6	Josh	This movie is a classic gem that is, in my opinion, the greatest movie of all-time!!! Liam Neeson does an excellent job in portraying Schindler, a German owner of a factory that saved Jews from concentration camps to have them work for him in this factory. Schindler slowly and gradually disnounced the war and what the Germans did to Jews as it went on. Schindler tried to save as many Jews as he could by having them work for him. This is a true story and the director Steven Spielberg makes that piece of history a movie masterpiece. Even the style of the movie is brilliant! The movie starts out with a color vision of some Jews sitting down to perform a sedar on passover. The movie then turns black-and-white to tell the story of Oskar Schindler. Throughout the movie, there are different color segment that express symbolism and harsh meaning. I do not cry during movies, I just don't. But this movie made me bawl like a baby at the end.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A34D06JL7LC6MU	"Joshua Miller ""Josh"""	"I guess the title of the review says it all, but I'll be a little more specific for an information hungry audience. If you look at the top 10 films on The American Film Institute's Top 100, you'll find that none of the films were made past the 1970's. In fact, only one of them is even made in the '70s. Eight of the films weren't released after the '50s. The only film in that top 10 to bypass those two eras is this film (which is at #9). Why though? This isn't the first or last film about the Holocaust. Is it because it's one of the most commercial of those films? No. Is it because Steven Spielberg is in the director's chair? Again, no. There are many contributing factors to this film's popularity and brilliance and few of those reasons are because of something you may think. To make a completely accurate film that displays every horror of the Holocaust would be impossible. It's the same with September 11th, which is why two films (United 93 and World Trade Center) have built stories around the event...Which is exactly what this film does. It takes a tragic event and instead of using it as the plot, merely uses it as the setting. It builds from this, the story and plot. The main character, Oskar Schindler, is played in an Oscar-worthy performance by Liam Neeson. An actor most people may know by now as Qui-Gon Jinn in ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace."" Schindler had no success in business before or after the holocaust and if not for his braveness, would no doubt not be remembered today. Schindler lives in Poland and is a part of the Nazi party. When we meet Schindler he is at a nightclub filled with Nazi officers. He sends them drinks and is soon sitting at tables with them. Spielberg (or is it screenwriter Steve Zaillian) makes it clear from the beginning, without really telling you...Schindler is a conman. As thousands of Jews are killed left and right, Schindler begins planning on opening a factory. The factory will make pots and pans, the workers will be jews. They won't be paid a cent and he will profit from it. He sounds like your typical Nazi, which is exactly what his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley, who is amazing) thinks as well. You probably already know this, but I'll tell you anyway. Schindler's plan was not to make money off the Jews, but to save them from death.It's a big con that Schindler doesn't admit to until the end of the film. If Schindler looked into the camera at the beginning of the movie and explained himself, rather than just being presented as we watch his con unfold, this film wouldn't work as well. Every film, no matter how small, contains it's hero and it's villain. The villian in this film should be the Holocaust, but they focus is on a character...In this case it's Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes, who plays the character perfectly). It's clear from when we first meet Goeth, that he's not sane. To quote Roger Ebert, ""War masks his underlying nature as a serial killer."" You could easily rank Goeth right up there with Hannibal Lecter, on a list of Evil Characters in Film. (Ironically, Fiennes played a serial killer in the prequel to ""The Silence of the Lambs,""Red Dragon.) With the exception of the opening of the film and the ending,the film is shot entirely in black and white. I don't know if color would have made the film any different, but if that was the case then we would lose one of the most haunting scenes of the film. The only color that appears between the beginning and the end is a young girl wearing red clothing. She, herself, is black&white; but her clothes are bright red. This scene could've been erased from the film, but the way it's done will cause you to remember. This film contains one of the most uplifting and amazing stories ever set to film, with amazing acting, and (most importantly, I think) it's entertaining. Is it the 9th best film ever made? I don't know about that. Is it one of the hundred most important films ever made? No. It's probably one of the fifty most important films ever made.GRADE: A"	5.0	A Very Important Film	2006-09-21	5	4	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1AEJ6I2Q42UB0	J. Rose	"I find myself compelled to take issue with the ""viewer from San Jose"", and his/her review titled ""good movie, bad research"" dated January 23 2004.While I do not suggest that Mr. Spielberg was 100% spot on regarding the historical accuracies of the film, I believe that this reviewer has completely missed the point. Oskar Schindler was a flawed man, no one will deny that. It is however historical record that that he personally saved some 900 Jewish lives. Mr. Spielberg has simply chosen his story to inform a wide audience of a limited number of events from a period that was probably the lowest point in human history. I guess the reason why he chose Schindler above, say, Rauol Wallenberg, is simply due to the existence of the excellent Novel by Thomas Keneally.(I personally believe that the one real flaw of Schindler's List is to portray a story with an essentially happy ending, but of course this is the problem with almost all holocaust films, since they portray ""survivor's tales"". The true horror of the holocaust lies in the stories of the those that did not survive, but conventional wisdom suggests no one would pay money to sit through a film that depressing, and they are probably right)While the reviewer is correct to point out that tens of millions of other people were killed during the Second World War, comparing 20 million Russians and 8 million Germans dying as the consequence of the war, mainly through fighting and starvationas a result of war, to the industrialized wholesale slaughter of the Jews is misleading. Hilter set his sights on one particular people above all; the Jews. At the end of the war, cattle trains transporting Jews to the gas chambers were given priority above trains transporting troops and supplies to the front lines. The entire War finally boiled down to a psychopathic desire to rid Europe of Jews once and for all. (lets not forget that had the Nazis succeeded in North Africa, the same fate would have awaited Jews there).As for the 5 million Poles he mentions, 3 million of them were Jews for crying out loud. A typically misleading statistic commonly used by Holocaust deniers.Now, for the reviewer's suggestion that Poland was full of people trying to help the Jews, the only reason why Poles make up a large proportion of the list of ""righteous gentiles"" is because half of the Jews in Europe happenned to live in Poland. They were therefore afforded far more opportunities to save Jews than any other nation. Why does the reviewer think that the camps were located in Poland? The reason is twofold - firstly, it was logistically the closest location to the largest Jewsish population, secondly, it was well known that Poles would tolerate the camps since they were among the most anti semitic people in Europe. A non Jewish friend of mine while visitng the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem (Yad Vashem) upon viewing the 13000 names of the ""righteous gentiles"" commented that there should in fact be millions of them, that every European should have tried to save Jews. It should be the rule, rather than the exception, shouldn't it?As for the reviewer's comments of the brutality of the Jewish police, this purely and simply an indication of being influenced by Holocaust deniers. While I will not deny that these people did not act in a despicable manner by cooperating with the Nazis (they did this out of a sense of self preservation mostly) it is ridiculous to suggest that they were as evil as the murderers of the SS. There are no stories (except perhaps concosted lies) about ""Judenrat"" stomping on pregnant women's stomachs or shooting children in front of their parents. And to complain that Schindler's List is too focused on the Jews is like complaining that 9-11 documentaries and books are too focused on American losses when there were dozens of other nationals that died.In the end, the most important point about this film is that it has drawn the attention of many people to the most shameful event in history. To paraphrase a character from the last Woody Allen film, if the punishment for the occurence of the holocaust would be the ceasation of mankind's continued existence, it could be argued that this punishment would be deserved and fair."	4.0	A very important film.	2004-01-29	24	19	5

The music alone speaks volumes of the suffering of the Holocaust. Having watched old black and white newsreel film covering World War II showing planes, tanks, men, bombing, etc...makes this movie being filmed in  black and white even more powerful to me because it makes me feel as though  I am seeing old new reel footage of the horrors of the Holocaust that Elie  Wiesel writes about in his book &quot;Night.&quot;  While no film maker can possibly capture the entirety of the Holocaust on film, Steven Speilberg does an excellent job of showing just how cheap life was to some Nazis aka. Ralph Fiennes's character. Seeing Schindler's List put a name, a face, and a voice behind all of those pictures I have seen of Jews with Nazi guns behind their heads waiting to be executed but forced to pose for one last humiliating picture before leaving this world.	5.0	Stunning!	2000-01-11	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1PABZF8ZQCXF3	Katherine M Barber	Steven Spielberg&#8217;s &#8220;Schindler&#8217;s List&#8221; is a significant look at the true story of Oskar Schindler&#8217;s journey from greedy capitalist Nazi to a man who gave away his fortune to save the lives of Jews. When we first meet Schindler, played by the always commanding Liam Neeson, he has arrived in Poland to profit from the war by opening an enamelware factory. He enlists a Jewish official Itzhak Stern, played by the exceptional Sir Ben Kingsley, to help him in his new venture. Recognizing an opportunity to save the lives of his fellow Jews by getting them deemed essential to the German war effort, Stern convinces Schindler to hire the lower cost Jewish labor. As the factory flourishes, SS Untersturmf&uuml;hrer Amon Goeth, chillingly played by Ralph Fiennes, successfully oversees the completion of the P&#322;asz&oacute;w concentration camp. Schindler view of the Jews begins to change as he quickly sees the twisted cruelty of Goeth as the Jewish ghetto is liquidated and the remaining Jews are transferred to P&#322;asz&oacute;w. Schindler learns to manipulate and bribe Goeth under the guise of friendship in order to continue to protect his employees. Meanwhile Goeth is intrigued and sometimes amused by Schindler&#8217;s willingness to protect his employees. As the camp conditions continue to deteriorate, Schindler grows closer to his employees who would later be referred to as &#8220;Schindlerjuden&#8221;. When informed that the camp is closing and all prisoners will be moved to Auschwitz due to Germany losing ground, Schindler makes the choice to spend his remaining fortune on bribing Goeth to let his employees come to his new munitions factory in order to ensure their safety. Schindler and Stern type up the famous document that would become known as &#8220;Schindler&#8217;s List&#8221; and from there we learn the fate of Oskar Schindler and his &#8220;Schindlerjuden&#8221;.&#8220;Schindler&#8217;s List&#8221; captures both the best and worst of humankind and adds a vivid testimony to the continuing impact of the Holocaust on modern Jewish and non-Jewish thinking. Many have looked at the Holocaust and questioned God&#8217;s existence. Some find it proof that there is no God or that God is dead. Others see it as a sign that God is a deity that does not care about earthly matters. Then there are those who look at everything that happened and find verification that there is a God and he is benevolent, because he gives each and every one of us free will. The destruction at the hands of the Nazis is free will in play, but the shows that the Nazis chose to ignore God&#8217;s guidance. Then there are the neighbors that hid their Jewish friends at the risk of death, the soldiers willing to lay down their lives to take down the Nazis, and people like Oskar Schindler who came to realize that his party was wrong and sacrificed everything he had to save the &#8220;Schindlerjuden&#8221; that worked for him. In those cases, something stronger was at play and that was people who used their free will to follow God&#8217;s will.	5.0	Schindler&#8217;s List, the Holocaust, and their effects on Jewish thinking.	2013-11-16	2	2	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A351HIWZ3U8AKI	Katie Mainc	Every once in a while, a movie does more than simply entertain. This movie moves you, make you think, makes you want to take action, and most importantly, perhaps, it leaves an imprint on your life. Schindler's List is one of these movies. It does all of the previously described and so much more.Schindler's List is about a rather selfish and greedy businessman named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson). His only concern is making money, and if he happens to help people while doing it, so be it. However, he begins to become almost obsessed with the idea of saving these people after seeing the horrors incurred on them from the grip of Hitler and especially the psychopathic Amon Goeth (Ralph Finnes).This movie is powerful in its writing and its storytelling. To see Schindler transform into this man who begins to use his absolute genius in business to save lives stirs up emotion in the viewer. To see Goeth's insanity allowed to manifest itself in his concentration camp sends shivers up the spine and feelings of disgust rise up.  Schindler's List even raises questions about politics and shows what happens if politics goes awry--mass chaos. One cannot help but want to yell out in some extremely tense and dramatically ironic scenes in the movie, which shows it's genius by stirring up the viewer.The movie is also a work of art. Using every possible artistic direction, the movie is even just simply beautiful to watch. It is shot entirely in black and white (except for one little girl's red coat) which simply adds to the setting of the movie. Lighting is used multiple times to help create mood. Camera angles are always different and help to cause emotion to, again, coming pouring out of the movie.The only negative I have about this movie is that you probably won't be able to do much afterwards due to the emotional drain you will experience.I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.	5.0	Absolute Masterpiece.	2007-11-27	6	5	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	"MOVIE: This is what you call a director's personal masterpiece.  For Steven Spielberg it was this, for Roman Polanski it was The Pianist, and for Peter Jackson it was the Lord Of The Rings films.  The film is so well made that it doesn't just open your eyes to the tragedy of the Holocaust, but it opens up the story of Oskar Schindler.  Schindler was a member of the Nazi party but he did not live to kill all beings inferior to specifications set by Adolf Hitler.  Schindler decided to take this war as an opportunity to become wealthy but in the midst of it all he realized that his workers were more than workers, they were people.  Schindler became emotionally involved and ended up saving many lives during this time.  The movie is powerful and does an excellent job at portraying the trueness of these historical characters.  Ralph Fiennes's portrays Amon Goethe, one of the most chilling and powerful performance of his career.  Schindler's List is not just some movie that tries to show its audience the horrors and suffering of the Jews, but instead uses the Holocaust as a backdrop for this amazing true tale.  The emotional journey of Schindler who is excellently portrayed by Liam Neeson is so incredible that it really emphasizes the saying of ""one person can make a difference"".  Some scenes are difficult to watch but speak the truth.  The movie is brilliant because it speaks the truth and for once the truth is all we need, not some fictional story of one man's journey to save hundreds of lives.  The life of Oskar Schindler shows us that one man can indeed make a significant difference.VIDEO: Surprisingly Universal delivered a very crisp transfer.  There was only one scene I remember where I saw a very dark heavy line come across the screen, but I think that was irreparable. Otherwise very well done.  The widescreen is 1.85:1, so if you have a 16X9 TV then you will have no black bars, and for 4:3 ratio TV's you will have thin bars, not thick.AUDIO: There is DTS track on the film but I feel it wasn't needed, and I do feel it was waste since it leaves little rooms for extras, but the sound on the other hand is perfect.PACKAGING / EXTRAS: I bought the DVD giftset which comes in a custom made plexiglass case.  Inside you take out a slip-sleeve and out falls the DVD case, a book which is a collection of pictures from the film, a limited edition film cell, and a certificate of authenticity.  When the disc first came out the suggested retail price was $79.95, but it seems Universal found out that no one was willing to pay a price so ridiculous so the price apparently dropped to $34.98, but at places such as Amazon you can get for much less.  The set also comes with the Soundtrack.  As goes for the extras all we get is a decent documentary about the actual Jews who were part of Schindler's list, and then a promotional advertisement turned documentary about the history of the NOAH foundation, a charity foundation for the survivors.  Sorry to say that's it, but the film itself is worth the money, and if you got the extra few bucks then go for the gift set.  I'm still angry at Spielberg for not taking a more personal approach to the DVD in terms of the film itself, the times we do see him in the two pieces it feels like he was forced into doing it almost. Pathetic in terms of extras but otherwise a smart investment for your collection.DVD SCORE: (7/10)"	5.0	Spielberg's Masterpiece On DVD, Without The Extras Though	2004-04-14	2	2	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A264BVEF28H2O0	Kelly	Schindler's List is based on a true story depicting the events of the Holocaust, and a man who tried to save as many Jews he could. The Holocaust took place during World War ll where millions of Jewish men, women, and children were killed by the Nazis. Oskar Schindler was a rich and successful factory owner. Although Schindler wore a swastika pin coining him as a Nazi, he had several Good Samaritan moments throughout the movie. During the war, Jewish families were being pushed out of their homes and lost all of their belongings. Many were killed, and many were taken to conservation camps for hard manual labor. There they suffered starvation, nakedness, and in many cases death. Schindler and his wife watched from a distance as hundreds of Jews were being shot in the streets. This was the eye opener for him, and he decided to go to the general to negotiate. The general laughed at Schindler for feeling sorry for the Jews and doing little things for them such as giving them water when the general had them crammed in a hot train. Schindler eventually convinced the general to give the Jews up to him so they can work in his factory. Schindler created a list of a thousand Jews that would come with him. He knew they would be safe at his factory, and made sure there would be no guards supervising their work. The Jews were grateful for Schindler, but he still felt extreme sorrow for those he did not save. In the movie he broke down and cried saying he could have saved one or two more if he sold his car, or if he sold his gold pin. The movie ends with the real Jewish survivors of the Holocaust paying their respects to Oskar Schindler by placing rocks one by one on his gravestone.	4.0	Schindler's List- World Religion	2012-11-12	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3O1TQKCKK4WOL	Kelly Poage	"This movie displayed a good portrayal of what the Jews went through during the Holocaust and what one man did to try to save as many as he could without jeopardizing himself.  Oscar Schindler was a very intelligent man to have come up with the idea to befriend so many officials for the German army and German government.  With his friends in high places that left him a lot of room to bend the rules and save 1100 Jews from death.He created a business to make items from metal for the German army and needed ""skilled labor"" which he trains Jews with no skills in metal.  He also has a artillery factory that he refuses to allow make ammunition that will fire.  These companies keep the Jews working and from being shot or being placed in the gas chamber because they are ""Schindler's Jews"".  Even when a named was for some reason placed on a ""kill"" list Schindler would go to the rescue of this individual.  He would not allow his highly skilled work force to be taken from him.  Even though he had a heart of gold he had to keep up the front of being part of the Nazi party.  The Jewish people had very few friends in Germany, Poland or anywhere in Europe.  People were afraid to be caught helping the Jews, due to it was certain and instant death.This movie did give an extraordinary sense of what it might have been like for the Jewish people during World War II.  I'm sure a lot was missing due to you can show all of the horrors they experienced on television or movies, yet it gives you a better idea than what you read in a text book.  As a mother it was hard to watch certain parts and I wasn't sure I would be able to make it through the entire movie and didn't in one viewing.  The thought of leaving my child to hide while I went off knowing I may never see my child again was horrifying.  Yet they did what they felt like they had to do at the time to try to insure their child would survive.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn more about the Jewish people and what they had to experience during the Holocaust.  These people lived through hell on earth from a man who could be considered the devil himself just because of their religious beliefs.  It is atrocious to think that any human could have thought of this torture let alone actually have it applied to living humans."	5.0	Schindler's List	2011-11-13	0	0	0

It was the first to have a real dramatic impact on me.  The acting is unreal, the script is amazing, the camera, direction, and effect on your heart and soul are all phenomenal!  This film is no joke, it is graphic and surreal and should be viewed by everyone to see the effects hatred can have on the world.  One requirement for this movie is that you must be able to take alot of violence and carnage(especially in the part when they liquidate the jewish ghetto).  This film is not ment to exploit, but to teach. Watch it, but be prepared, especially for thr overwhelming tear-jerking conclusion.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2PXHFGJZBNLXB	Kenji Fujishima	"As someone who is not European or Jewish, I will leave comments and criticisms about certain facts or depictions in this movie for someone who ""knows the territory"" better. As an involved movie-watcher, though, there can be no doubt about the picture itself: Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST is, and perhaps always will be, a remarkable testament to a brave man, one who found it in his heart to take all the money he had made during WWII and use it to try to save hundreds of Jews from mass extinction at the hands of the evil Nazis.You wouldn't know that Oskar Schindler would become such a revered man in history the way he is in the early stages of the war. He is rich, he is a womanizer, and he is only concerned with making money. That's why he sets up his munitions factory in the first place: to make money for himself, to profit from the war. It is only later, when the Jews who work for him are to be sent to Auschwitz, does he do something truly selfless and heroic: he uses his charm and knack for bribery to try to save the Jews who had worked for him from inevitable extermination. One of Spielberg's great achievements in SCHINDLER'S LIST is not necessarily that he sticks with Schindler and shows him going through his change of heart---in fact, his change of heart is comparably sudden, as depicted in this film---but that he does it so subtly. Schindler sees and hears terrible things, but Spielberg and screenwriter Steve Zaillian (adapting from a book by Thomas Keneally) never try to beat it into our heads or over-sentimentalize things (as Spielberg is wont to do in some of his movies) with extraneous voiceovers or any such cheap devices. Spielberg trusts the material, as well as his lead actor, Liam Neeson, to basically tell itself, to make its properly sobering effect on the viewer without the need for slobbering hysterics.In fact, I am tempted to say that SCHINDLER'S LIST is not necessarily just about Schindler himself. Schindler's story is typical ""triumph-of-the-human-spirit"" stuff; what makes this movie special is that Spielberg is attempting to honestly portray the experience of being a Jew in the hell that was the Holocaust---how friends can turn on other friends all in the name of survival, how neighbors can suddenly become enemies, how people can lose their sanity and become heartless murderers...and even how one man can rise above the madness and do a heroic deed, as Schindler did. In trying to encompass as much as possible of the Jewish experience during this terrible time in history, Spielberg has created a film that is probably one of the most complete, all-embracing portraits of the effect on personal lives of the Holocaust that I've seen or read (although I don't claim to be an expert on the subject, by any means).That, and it is as invigoratingly dramatic a movie as you could want from one that runs for a little over 3 hrs. Spielberg retains some of his instincts as an entertainer, and he also has the brilliant editor Michael Kahn on hand to make sure that this movie is always paced judiciously---this movie never drags. And he coaxes a great, charismatic, authoritative performance out of Neeson, one that helps you realize how he was able to get his way during the war (and why many women probably found him attractive, hehe). Ben Kingsley is no less impressive as his loyal accountant Itzhak Stern. And Ralph Fiennes, as the evil Nazi Amon Goeth, gives a surprisingly fascinating performance; Fiennes never downplays his character's baseness, but neither does he overdo it either---there's always something convincingly human (if nothing necessarily redeemable) to this monster.SCHINDLER'S LIST is not a perfect movie, but perhaps perfection is too much to ask for for such an ambitious work. I must admit, though, that I occasionally winced at some of the film's more heavy-handed gestures. The worst offender is a scene towards the end, when Schindler starts to sob about how he felt he didn't do enough while Stern blatantly extols the virtue of his act. Spielberg cannot resist trying to milk tears from his audience at that point, and the result strikes me as false and perhaps a bit out of character for the normally stoic (at least on the outside) Schindler. And, to be hypercritical, I suppose I would have preferred John Williams' score to be a little less obviously solemn all the time, as beautifully as Itzhak Perlman performs the impassioned violin solos. (Spielberg rationed the use of an underscore in his 1998 SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, an approach that might have worked here, too.)There is so much to honestly praise about this movie, though, that those faults hardly matter. SCHINDLER'S LIST is a motion picture that does full justice to such a harrowing subject and a remarkable act of bravery. This is a must-see if I've ever seen one (and believe me, I rarely say that about a lot movies)."	5.0	A remarkable testament to a brave man	2005-01-06	6	3	3
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1TO1P3NV7OAU6	"KevinB ""The Honey Badger"""	Schindler's list is about the Nazi party womanizer, and war profiteer who saved the lives the lives of more than a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. It's the story of how 1 man with pure intentions can make a difference, and the drama of the lives that survived one of the most terrible times in human history because of his actions.This is one of the most touching movies I've ever seen. It is also a true story. The film graphically shows the horrors of the mass murdering Adolf Hitler, and his SS. At times it is hard to watch, but definitely worth it. If you don't think that 1 person can change the world, you think wrong. Oscar Schindler not only saved the lives of the Jews that worked in his factories, he saved the lives of all their descendants all the way into infinity. That's a hell of a lot of people. If you haven't seen this classic, you need to, but not with children present.	5.0	Awe Inspiring	2012-11-25	1	1	0

Steven Spielberg is a master at creating tension, fear and mood in this period piece done in black and white. It is one of the few films that really help s to educate and inform a public that is rapidly loosing those who experienced the holocaust.  I use it every year in my US History classes.  Many students report that they had no idea that it was as horrible as it was.  It also makes a big impact on the students and I always get positive comments though many find the film disturbing.  I always get parental input and approval for showing this masterpiece.	5.0	Schindlers List is a must view	2007-01-11	2	1	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3HZ4KROUF1D7M	kevin patterson	Plot SummaryThe movie Schindler&#8217;s List takes place during the Holocaust that took place in WWII. It is about a German Nazi named Oskar Schindler and how he ending up helping save many Jewish lives. Schindler starts of as a lavish, lady loving, business man who wants to start up a factory. In the process of getting his factory started he works with a Jewish man Itzhak Stern to help him out. Schindler hires Jewish workers because their labor is very cheap but as time goes on his interests turn from making money to keeping his workers safe after he sees some horrible things happen at the concentration camps.  Schindler makes a &#8220;list&#8221; of names of people that he wants to be kept safe and sent to a place he has arranged for them to go. Schindler ends of saving many lives through extreme bribery before he himself has to run away to avoid capture at the end of the war since he is a Nazi.World ReligionSchindler&#8217;s List tells a story of the Holocaust which is also known as the Shoah. The acts of violence that were shown in the movie were clearly a &#8220;whirlwind&#8221;. In studying world religions one can see that the &#8220;hatred&#8221; of the Jewish people started long before Hitler but it goes all the way back to the Romans and is followed by the Christians. The Shoah really shows just how strong peoples hatred for the Jewish really was. As a result of the Holocaust about one third of the world&#8217;s Jewish population was killed, at the end of the movie the descendants of survivors that were saved by Schindler are shown so you can see the impact he has had today even though he felt like he should have done more.Schindler&#8217;s List is also filled with plenty of Jewish religious references. One very noticeable reference is the Star of David, which is a symbol of Jewish identity, which every Jewish person had to wear on them at all times. At one point in the movie the evil Nazi Goeth referred to Schindler as Moses since he was trying to save &#8220;his people&#8221; (his Jewish workers). There is reference of the Sabbath and that the people needed to prepare for it because it was already Friday night. The ring that Schindler is given at the end of the movie has writings from the Talmud which are works of commentary on the laws of the Torah and teachings of the Hebrew bible. The final scene of where all the Jews are singing in Hebrew and walking to get to a safe land compares to Moses and his people looking for their promise land.	5.0	Summary and Religions connection	2014-04-01	1	1	0

Gittins	"The ""list"" itself is the list of names of workers that Oskar Schindler saved, at his own expense, from being transported to concentration camps. The movie has great acting and though Liam Neeson's acting was ""Oskar"" nominated, Ralph Fiennes was super as Goeth, and Kingsley was excellent as well. Some great cinematography too - the candle smoke cutting to the train smoke, for one (somewhat like TE Lawrence blowing out the match then cut to desert sunrise, or ""2001"" bone to spaceship cut) and any of dozens of other haunting images. Schindlers's List has some excellent dialog. Some examples are when Schindler talks to Goethe about ""power"", or Stern talking about the list being ""absolute good"", or Schindler crying because he could have saved more people by giving away his Nazi pin or other personal items.Sentimental? Maybe. Many Spielberg movies are too sappy for me, but this was not. Glosses over low-lights of Schindler himself? Probably. Doesn't really matter, though.This is Schindler's speech to the assembled Jewish workers and Nazi guards:""The unconditional surrender of Germany has just been announced. At midnight tonight, the war is over. Tomorrow, you'll begin the process of looking for survivors of your families. In most cases, you won't find them. After six long years of murder, victims are being mourned throughout the world. We've survived. Many of you have come up to me and thanked *me*. Thank yourselves. Thank your fearless Stern. And others among you who worried about you, and faced death at every moment. (Sighs). I'm a member of the Nazi party. I'm a munitions manufacturer. I'm a profiteer of slave labor. I am...a criminal. At midnight you'll be free, and I'll be hunted. I shall remain with you until 5 minutes after midnight, after which time - and I hope you'll forgive me - I have to flee. (To the guards). I know you have received orders from our Commandant, which he has received from his superiors, to dispose of the population of this camp. Now would be the time to do it. Here they are, they are all here. (Gestures.) This is your opportunity. (Long pause.) Or, you could leave. And return to your families as men, instead of murderers. (A young guard leaves, slowly followed by the other guards, and finally the officer.) (To his workers). In memory of the countless victims among your people, I ask us to observe 3 minutes of silence. (Crosses himself.)""Not many ""better"" movies out there, even though you have to turn the DVD over in mid-movie."	5.0	Schindler's List among the best movies	2004-03-12	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1YMDAO293S1WT	Kimberly	A few years back I was given this movie as a gift. I was enjoyed every second of the movie especially because of the historically accurate account of the things that occurred during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Schindler&#8217;s List is based on a real life account of German business man Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who aligns himself with the Nazi party in order to take advantage of the situation in Poland by having Jewish prisoners of war work in his factory as slave laborers. However, over time, Schindler sees the atrocities committed by the Nazi&#8217;s and wants to do something to help the Jewish people. He has his account Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) create a list of individuals who work for him in his factory. He then tells the German military officers that if they are harmed, it will &#8220;be bad for business&#8221; and that he will hold the soldier responsible for any harm done without just cause. He tells the soldiers that he will pursue a financial grievance against the soldier if they harm his &#8220;workers&#8221;.Although he was not able to save all of his Jewish workers, in the end he was credited with having saved the lives of over 1,100 Jewish prisoners. The hardest part of the movie for me is of course at the end when it shows many of the surviving &#8220;Schindler children&#8221; as they are today; walking passed the gravesite of Oskar Schindler and laying flowers and giving thanks to him. Some of which were main characters in the movie such as Itzhak Stern himself. It brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it.This movie is certainly in my top 10 and after watching, I&#8217;m sure you will agree.I think this movie does a great job illustrating the issue of world religion and war. How could one man convince an entire nation to follow his radical ideals? The Holocaust or Shoah is the single greatest tragedy in Jewish life in the last 100 years, all because one man decided that a race of people needed to be exterminated. It shows the prejudices against faiths, and how people have a choice: are they evil, or are they good? Power is when you have every right to take a life, but choose not to. This sums up every religion out there. You have the power to do good, and the power to do evil.	5.0	I was enjoyed every second of the movie especially because of the ...	2014-07-07	0	0	0

I'm sure if they were to watch this film they would say it was heavily sensationalized.  How they would explain the true life accounts of those who were actually saved by Schindler, I do not know.  The story is fascinating because we watch Schindler, an ordinary man out to make a buck and have a good time, develop a conscience or become more acutely aware of what he already knew what was wrong and take a brave, expensive stand to do the right thing.  The acting, cinematography, plot development - all superb.  The violence is graphic but not gratuitous.  It is necessary to depict the times and events as they were and how they occurred.I would NOT recommend this movie for anyone under the age of 11, probably 12 and I am a mother who took her 10 year old daughter to tour Dachau. The violence is extremely graphic and disturbing.

Wonderful movie and one of my most favorites of all time! I was quiet thrilled that this movie was chosen by my World Religion course to do a movie review on and has even been a part of my personal movie collection for several years. This movie is extremely vivid with astronomical and heart wrenching detail, which brings it to life and connects the viewer with a feeling as if you are actually witnessing the horrifying tragedy of the Holocaust. You are permanently glued to the edge of your seat and find yourself emotionally tied, rooting for Schindler's success.Liam Neeson portrays an amazing Oskar Schindler in this movie and a more suitable actor couldn't have been chosen for this role. Oskar Schindler is a German Catholic who lives in Poland during the horrific event of World War II. He is a member of the Nazi party, a war profiteer, and a greedy businessman who loves his booze probably as much as his women.  In the beginning Schindler is a callous man that only selfishly cares for himself and money. He begins a journey to open a factory, employing Jews because they are ""cheap labor"" and convinces the Nazis of this essentiality. He embarks on this aspect of his journey with his newfound Jewish accountant, Itzhak Stern, who initially refuses to help but then uses his position as an opportunity to save the lives of the Jews, who would be killed at the hands of the Nazis. Eventually Schindler becomes aware of Stern's intent and begins a tirade but Schindler succumbs to the warmth and kindness of humanity within his heart and his compassion for the lives of his workers is bonded. Schindler offers many bribes and money to bring Jews to his factory in order to save their lives. Schindler is fully aware that the lives of his Jewish workers are at the faith of the Nazi party with the construction of the Plaszow concentration camp in Krakow being completed so Schindler convinces a vicious Nazi, Amon Goeth to sell him his Jewish workers. Out of desperation to save the Jews, Schindler has his accountant, Itzhak Stern, to type a list containing the names of Schindler's Jewish employs; these are the Jews that he purchases within his company who will accompany the relocation to Czechoslovakia for their safety. The Nazi party was unaware of Schindler's true motives, to sustain the lives of these Jews and to save as many of them as he possibly could.  The men, women, and children remain at the factory until the war finally comes to an end and Oskar Schindler, along with his reunited wife Emilie, are forced to flee or be hunted as criminals of war. Even though Schindler cried, wishing he could've done more, he was responsible for saving a remarkable 1,100 Jewish lives from Auschwitz during the Holocaust.This movie is a must see!"	5.0	Schindler's List	2012-11-15	0	0	0

Korthaus ""K"""	"I am not a fan of Steven Spielberg, in fact I do consider him childish and unable to deal with serious topics in a mature complex matter. In fact , there is always his annyoing childlike view of the world underneath the surface of the technical brilliance that characterizes his films. It would be unfair to call Shind'ler's List biased against Germans. That would be idiotic as the very hero of the story is German himself.Yet one has to look pretty deeply to see Spielbergs resentments.- The role of Amon Goeth, the Austrian SS Commanderof Plaszow was to be casted with a German Actor at first, Spielberg wanted Goetz George, who is a known acto in Germany and who until today openly admitted his suffering from his fathers (Heinrich George) appearance in Nazi Propagande flicks during the 1930s. George declined Spielbergs offer vehemnetly as he knew that working with a notorious German hating dircetor like Spielberg who is known for bitching around on the set is nothing a serious actor would want. Strangely though the ""good German"" Oskar Shindler himself is played by an American, how authentic.So instead an ""ugly Brit"" like Ralph Fiennes has to do the job.Goetz George had no problem whatsoever to play the Auschwitz war criminal Mengele in ""After the Truth"", a film that was made five years after SL.- Spielberg many times admitted that he felt repulsion for the German actors who played the SS. Well, it was Spielberg who wanted them to wear the uniform, not themselves. Also again, why not use Americans for them as well ??? How about Ed Harris or Clint ""Granite Face"" Eastwood as the guy who shoots the kid ??? No that job needs to be done by the Germans of course. Every German actor with a bit of self esteem should turn down any offer from Spielberg. The biggest insult was that Spielberg received the Bundeverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit) from the German government.- Recently the German TV channel VOX broadcasted a two hour special about the real Shindler. The had shown the original footage of Amon Goeth's execution by the Russians. Goeth did neither lift his arm for a last Sieg Heil nor did the Russians had to kick the bucket three times underneath his feet. He was hanged at a makeshift gallow without any emotional reaction.The survivors of Plaszow themselves said in the interviews that the movie treis to bring the horror close to the viewer yet does not come even close to the real atrocities commited by Goeth.Also GOeth had two housemaids called Helene. On said in the interview that Goeth's affcetion for her in portrayed in the film was just another Hollywood invention. In reality he just would mistreat his slave workers without warning and with absolute cruelty.Spielberg could not resist to add Hollywood cliche to the film.Something he did in every ""serious"" film he ever directed (and ruined).Except for that Shindler's List is one of the better films about the Holocaust, although there is no film that can bring the Holocaust ""close"" to the viewer. As film always creates a ""safe distance"". The best would be to visit one of the Concentration camp memorial sites at Auschwitz or Belsen. That is a haunting experience."	4.0	Fair review ???

Oskar Schindler is a German businessman whose increasing consciousness of the happenings of the Jewish people becomes his mission to save as many of them as he can from Nazi persecution. From a both a non-Jewish and Jewish perspective, The Holocaust was seen as a selective hatred on the Jewish people, who were a group that did nothing to deserve such an awful ordeal. Oskar Schindler became aware of the treatment and killings of the Jewish people and decided to do something about it. He began by hiring Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant, who together with Oskar, would help to save over one thousand Jewish lives from the fatality of the Holocaust. Oskar had to think as both a Jewish and non-Jewish person to accomplish his goal. He had to use non-Jewish thinking in order to relate and make friends with the Nazi's, to make them think he was on their side of supporting the Germans in the war. He did this by buying gifts for the Nazi generals and doing things like throwing parties. Once he was able to gain the trust of the Nazi organization, he was able to convince them to help him with his business venture, in that the war was impacting his business and his money. Oskar convinced the Nazis that he needed Jews to work in order to benefit the Germans by making items made from metal that they could use. By doing this, he was then able to collect Jewish people from the concentration camps to work in his factory. He continued to collect more and more people by bribing the officers and generals with gifts, all while thinking in a Jewish perspective of why such doings were happening to them and how could he save more people. He eventually created a list along with Stern that included the names of hundreds of people, in which Oskar planned to request from the Nazis to work in his factory. This list along with Oskar's growing consciousness to help and save others from the cruel fatalities, led him to save almost 1,100 lives from being gassed in Auschwitz.It is an amazing movie, that I strongly suggest to everyone, that will affect the consciousness of everyone to remember what once was and how one person can change the lives of many.	5.0	An amazing story that everyone must see!	2012-03-25	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2Q07KQAAFWVL7	Kristoffer Infante	That's the tagline of Steven Spielberg's 1993 holocaust epic, SCHINDLER'S LIST (a film that has inspired me with my own film, TRIANGLE). What is this film? A documentary? A memorial service? A biopic? The answer is all of the above. It is a realistic look at a man who began as a womanizing criminal and ended as a sympathetic savior to thousands of Jewish people.Based on Thomas Keneally's bestselling novel, it is passionate look at the Jewish struggle during the ghetto liquidation by the Nazis and in the concentration camps.Filmed entirely on location in Poland and in black-and-white, with some color aspects, SCHINDLER'S LIST brings to life one of the saddest chapters in history. Starring Liam Neeson as industrialist Oskar Schindler; Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth; Ben Kingsley as Schindler's accountant Itzhak Stern; and Caroline Goodall as Schindler's wife, Emilie.This is a film too sad to imagine, but also very important to watch and shameful to miss. Neeson does an extraordinary job in showing us the man who saved so many lives. A man whom most would call a pirate, he has shown us a brighter light. But, honestly, the one who impressed me (and shocked me the most) was Ralph Fiennes as a Nazi superior. Fiennes was known for playing romantic heroes on the London stage before playing such a dastardly role. (In the end, you can't help but cheer when he is eventually hanged.) And to Ben Kingsley (Oscar-winner for GANDHI), always the dependable one! His Stern provided me enough time to breathe a sign of relief and smile at his nervously mousy character. From his being trapped inside the train to his trying to reason with Schindler about the one-arm man's dependability working in the factory (a rare comedic moment in the film).This is a triumph in every way possible! To watch a man, whom we never even heard of, save thousands of lives is heart-breakingly wonderful. Good job, Steven!Winner of 7 Academy Awards including: Best Picture - Steven Spielberg, Branko Lustig &amp; Gerald R.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2Q8ZUGTLRRO1U	Kristyn S.	Schindler's List starts at the time in history immediately after German y defeats Poland.  The Jews in the country are forced to register with the government and abandon their homes.  They are moved to designated communities called ghettos and are no longer allowed to own businesses.  Mr. Schindler, a business man, proposes a contract with some wealthy Jews.  They give him their money, since they cannot use it anymore, and Mr. Schindler purchases a factory.  He employs many of the Jews at his factory so that they may earn the basic living essentials, as they have no use for money in the ghettos.  When the ghettos are invaded and the Jews transported to a work camp, Mr. Schindler makes a deal with the director of the camp to take his workers back to the factory in exchange for some of the profits.  The workers are thrilled to get out of the harsh conditions of the work camp where anyone can be shot and killed at any time for any or no reason.  Once word gets out about Schindler's factory, he acquires many more workers that would have likely been killed at the camp.Eventually the government shuts down the work camp and all of the Jews are going to be sent to the concentration camp Auschwitz.  Mr. Schindler devises a plan to open an ammunition factory and employ all of the Jews from the work camp and his previous factory.  He makes a list of all of the Jews he wants to employ at his factory.  When the trains come to transport them to the factory in Czech Slovakia, the train with the women is accidentally sent to Auschwitz.  Mr. Schindler bribes the director at the concentration camp with gold if he will relinquish his workers.  They are transported to the factory and seven months later the war is over and they are free.  Mr. Schindler was a good man who saved eleven hundred Jews from uncertain death at concentration camps.This movie directly relates to world religions because it was one of the most integral times in, not only Jewish history, but also world history.  It exemplifies the degree of oppression the Jews faced under Hitler's rule.  Over six million Jews were killed in the holocaust directly because of their heritage and religious beliefs.  Schindler's List was a great example of the horrible treatment and murder of Jews during the holocaust and was able to give me a realistic depiction of what life was like during that time.	4.0	Schindler's List	2012-11-12	0	0	0

Since I was in the presence of film masters, I thought, maybe I can watch and learn a few things about when and how to narrate in video and in words.

Sriamphai	"English is not my first language but oh well , I wanna write this review anyway!I read many reviewers say about the inacuracy of Schidler's story. Personally I think ""Who gives a sh...t about that""?The messege of the movie is ""Schindler saved lots of jews"" ...This is all We wanted to learn.Some reviewers were saying that...Schindler saved jews for his own benefit (I think that is not true anyway). Even if that is true .....again ... ""Who gives a shi....t if he saved jews for his own benefit . All we know is at least about 1000 jews didn't die because of Schindler? We should Thank to Schindler anyway!Some reviewers were saying about the MORALITY. Then why do you people ask Spilburg about the morality? Why don't you people ask this question to the Nazis? They are the one who killed miilions jewish!This movie teaches me so many things. Teach me to give and not to be ""too"" greedy and also care for another people. Unlike another movie that you just watch and laugh and that's it ....doesn't give you much back. If it is not because of this movie ....Maybe in this life I would never know a man named ""SCHINDLER""Anyway, enough with my horible English. Last thing I wanna say is ...THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!

I can't tell you how disappointed I was by this film. It seems to borrow from &quot;Night of the Generals&quot; and has none of the Holocaust reality of &quot;Shoah&quot; that was later projected in a truly great World War II film, &quot;The Pianist&quot;.I think my personal disappointment about this and other Steven Spielberg dramas is shared by my opinion of Tom Hanks dramas. I simply don't think these directors have what it takes to be great dramatic directors -- a large slice of terror, pessimism or negativity in their personalities. I think they are too sunny and that sunshine cannot be hidden, even in topics like the Holocaust. For me, &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is not a great film and does not compare to the great World War II films. I think it compares to &quot;Night of the Generals&quot;.	3.0	Well done and an important story, but overhyped	2004-07-24	17	6	11

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3SR2FSNU40ZSD	"L. Boki ""L. Boki"""	"Lord Spielberg has really topped himself with this thoroughly engrossing cinematic experience. I have seen this magnificent work of art on numerous occasions. When I want to be taken back in time this is worth my investment for many, many reasons. I have a strange gene within that is totally fascinated by man's inhumanity to man. Having traveled to Austria and Germany, I have seen a couple of former concentration camps, I believe Dachau was one that has eerily been transformed into a suburban neighborhood. I think with ""The Color Purple"" and ""Schindler's List"", Mr. Spielberg is without a peer. Both of those movies, ""Schindler's List"" being far more graphic, demonstrate how there exist this near unexplainable cruelty that permeates a few inhumane claymation subbing as human. To this day, I have deep issues of ever returning to Germany again or any of our southern states. Sure it can be said that was a different time and place. But the energy of those demented souls still fly like philistines in our world. I recommend you try reading a book, ""Political Ponerology"" that focuses on people like bush, cheney and the entire neo-nazi figures of today.I will say if you have ever seen The Shoah Foundation's documentary ""The Last Days"", there is a near note by note rebuttal discrediting the accuracy of that documentary. Some bitter, non-holocaust believer actually assembled contrasting footage and interviews that seriously makes you reevaluate ""Schindler's List"". I find most holocaust deniers as dark, vindictive souls. But, if you go to YouTube and put in rebuttal to ""The Last Days"" you can draw your own conclusion.I recently put myself through watching Leni Reifensthal's ""The Triumph of the Will"", hitler's ultimate propaganda piece. I just can never make peace with an entire country recklessly adhering to hitler's evil agenda to ""cleanse"" the German race. ""Schindler's List"" does offer the contrast in Oskar Schindler's humanity.This is easily my 4th copy of ""Schindler's List"". Though I have seen this epic work nearly 30xs, I almost inevitably find or hear something I may not have heard before. I am hoping the Blu-Ray disc offers another revelation."	5.0	One of My All-Time Favorite Movie Experiences	2013-02-09	11	6	5

From purely entertaining, escapist fare like ""Close Encounters"" and ""Jaws"" to touching dramas like ""A Color Purple"" and ""Always."" But for a director to go from creating the hugely successful thriller ""Jurassic Park"" to such a profound drama as ""Schindler's List"" is simply staggering. In all its gritty realism, Spielberg presents images that will sear a permanent place in the viewer's mind. His representation of Nazi brutality is utterly bone chilling. I saw this film with a sold-out house at the Uptown Theatre in Washington, D.C. Not only will I never forget my emotional reaction to it, but also of reaction by those around me. The emotional outpouring ranged from sobbing to actual outbursts by some elderly viewers, who were so caught up by the film's intensity, that they shouted aloud obscenities at the Nazi characters on the screen. Never have I sat through a film that had such a profound impact on its audience. I'll never forget that experience.

So what?  Should we watch Holocaust movies for character  studies?  NO.We can like the characters, but the heart of this  beautiful, beautiful film is its power to convey how it was to live in that  time and place.If Schindler was not corrupt but ultimately redeemed in  the exact way as in the film...  I do not care.  He represents a flawed  decency unlike many characters possess in films.  He is real, even if he is  not the real Oskar Schindler.If Goeth was not such a monster...  Oh  well.  The character, portrayed wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes, represented  evil in its purest.  Watching this film made me despise such hate more than  years of Hitler demonizing could--it made me realize that there is such  evil.This film was not a character film.  It was not an Academy Award  film shoe-in.  And if Spielberg did win, it was because the Academy finally  realized his talent--but only when they couldn't refuse it.  This film  couldn't lose because it was the best picture of the year(and many others,  I'd say).Watch this film and feel.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1U6B2LDK3BUVU	"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are..."	This is a very emotional film.  It infuriated me, to see how the Germans treated the Jews.  The most visible villain in the film is the commander of a concentration camp, and he is pictured here as an insane psychopath in certain scenes, notably the one in which he accuses a Jewish girl of being to blame for his attraction to her, playing the scene with enough irrationality to place him in the Bates Motel in Psycho.  I wouldn't have made that choice.  I think the Germans knew reality from fantasy and were not clinically insane.  They were just cold hearted and evil.Oscar Schindler himself is pictured, by the end of the film, as a saint, tormented because he didn't sell his car in order to save ten more Jews.  I don't know if that was overdone or not, but I gratefully applaud Oscar Schindler for being one of the very few kind people in Europe at that time.There have been many other genocides in recent history.  They seem to occur on a fairly regular basis in Africa these days.There were many crimes against humanity during World War Two.  The Japanese were right up there with the Germans.  The Japanese murdered six million innocent Chinese civilians and sent their army to rape and murder Chinese civilians everywhere they went.  They committed unspeakable war crimes, like tossing Chinese babies in the air and catching them on their bayonets in front of the parents.  It seems as if Satan himself walked the Earth during World War Two and ruled both Germany and Japan.  Japan was well on its way towards detonating an atom bomb over San Francisco, so it was fortunate that they were forced to surrender shortly before their own A-bomb was ready for delivery.There was some unfinished business at the end of this film.  It left me wondering what happened to two people after the war - Oscar Schindler and Helen Hirsch, the woman who was tormented by the insane Nazi concentration camp commander.  You must watch some of the extras to get updated on that.  Oscar Schindler lived out his life without any wealth, helped by some of the grateful Jews he saved.  He left his wife.  As for Helen Hirsch, we actually get to see her place a stone on the grave of Oscar Schindler.  She lived to a ripe old age.  But the interest that she built in the movie was just left hanging at the end of the movie.This is a painful movie to watch, but it is well done.  Jew-hatred is very popular all over the world today, and of course in Germany, and the young Germans barely know a thing about the crimes against God and humanity that their grandparents committed and applauded.  This movie really needs to be shown to everyone in Germany.Every time I see a Beck's Beer commercial, or a Mercedes Benz or other German car commercial, and I see the Germans once again playing Master Race and telling us that their product is superior because it was made by Germans, I am left to realize that the German people learned absolutely nothing from the Holocaust or the war.  Cars made in other countries don't brag about the race of the people who engineered the cars.  You don't hear Toyota proudly exclaiming it is the product of Japanese engineering, and you don't hear Cadillac bragging that it is the product of American engineering.  I don't understand why the German people are so race conscious and why they are so particularly proud and superior.  I see no reason for that superiority complex.  If anything, I'd think they would be ashamed to be German, not still crowing about it.	5.0	Very emotional and infuriating film	2006-05-21	14	4	10
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1GWS61QEVYYF6	LG777	"Schindler's List is a movie that will bring you to tears, make you angry and also slightly thankful that there were some good during the evil that ruled in War World II. The movie gives us an idea of what kind of suffering Jews went through during Hitler's rule. They were first forced to move out of their homes and live in ""Ghettos"" communities of Jews that were under strict rule and unfit living conditions. They had to give up their belongings and slave away at work without any compensation. Schindler was a popular, good looking and successful businessman who was part of the Nazi Party, but he didn't share the belief of killing off the Jewish population. He had Jewish workers and although he socialized with the cruel Nazi leaders he didn't want to see his employees or innocent people killed. Schindler watched when the Ghetto was being destroyed, soldiers were marching down the streets, through neighborhoods shooting down people. Innocent Jews, men, women and children were terrified and some tried to hide but were not successful, entire families were brutally shut down. Schindler watched a little girl in a red coat (while the movie is in black and white) run. He later saw the red coat on a little body lying dead on a pile of bodies. I think this red represented all the blood from the genocide. Schindler bribed the officer in charge of the camp, Goeth, to keep ""his"" Jews as workers so he can keep his company working. But in reality he couldn't stand to see those get killed. In the camps Jews are treated inhumanely, starved, ridiculed, and made to be terrified not knowing when the officers will shoot them. They had to be stripped down naked in front of everyone and separated from sufficient to work or not in which case were sent off to death camps. Children, elderly and sick were automatically sent off to die. When they started being sent off to Auschwitz Schindler made a list of over 1000 people, Jews that he wanted as his workers out of the camps and in his factory. He gave up all the money and wealth he had to save those people. He had just enough money to save them until the war was over. This movie showed how quickly things escalated from Jews not being liked to them being stripped off their belongings, family, health, food, water and life. These people were educated, some wealthy some just normal people with families and within days they were removed from life as they knew it and became prisoners, slaves. The movie starts off with a family lighting candles for Jewish holiday and ends with Schindler encouraging celebrating the Sabbath. There were also Jewish songs during the movie. The movie touched me even more because they mentioned my birth country Yugoslavia. I could understand most of what was said when they didn't speak English. Everyone should watch this movie to realize what Jews went through."	5.0	Schindler's List	2013-11-03	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	This amazingly powerful film tells of a war profiteer in WW2 who turns into a savior of Jews. Liam Neeson plays the title Oskar Schindler, a Nazi party member who makes great money using the slave labor during World War II. Little by little he realizes just what he is wrapped up in, and he risks his life and fortune to start saving the Jewish people. By the end, he has rescued over 1,000 Jews.The movie won numerous awards even though Spielberg risked his modern audience by shooting the film mostly in black and white. He in fact won Best Picture of 1993. Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley was great as Itzhak Stern. There are so many great performances in the movie that it's almost a shame to call a few out.Even with the black and white colors, you immediately get immersed in this story. I know many people who lived through Poland and Germany in World War II and the attention to detail is just immense. Many, many people that I talk with came out of this movie viewing in tears. It is not a 'historical' movie. It's a movie about real people, in a real situation, and the very difficult choices they had to make. It is about taking the difficult road that you know is right, rather than coasting along the easy road.I really recommend this as a must-watch to any person over age 13. If a youngster is to watch this one, I recommend watching it with an adult so the issues can be talked about afterwards.	5.0	A true must see	2004-03-05	15	12	3

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2M1B750OV0PXR	"""maelstrom1"""	Schindler's List is my favorite historical drama of all-time for a number of reasons. Not only is it a masterpiece from a cinematic point of view, but it is priceless for the story it tells to the world.First of all,  the acting is superb. Liam Neeson does well as Oskar Schindler, but in  particular I liked Ben Kingsley (as Istak Stern, Schindler's accountant)  and Ralph Fiennes (as Amon Goeth, the camp commandant). All of the  performances were very convincing and reflect the good  casting.Another great feature of this film is the soundtrack. Slow,  soaring music tells of the painful circumstances of the Jews and of their  conflict with the Nazi regime. Mixed in with the instrumental pieces are  Jewish melodies which also gave me a sense of the cultural traditions of  the Jewish people.From a technical point of view, the decision by  director Spielberg to shoot the movie is black-and-white was a good one. In  fact, I think it makes the movie better than it would have been in color.  The few color segments throughout the movie are aptly placed and help to  focus the viewer's attention on particular details through the eyes of  Schindler. The scenery and photography were excellent compared to other  movies I have seen and contribute to the whole atmosphere of the 1940s.  Some people may be put off a bit by the length (over 3 hours) but believe  me, every minute is worthwhile. Unlike other long movies, there are no  lulls or useless scenes -- everything counts.The best part of the movie  without any doubt is the story itself, the tale of Oskar Schindler and how  he was able to save 1100 Jews from the Auschwitz gas chambers by employing  them in his enamelware factory and eventually his shelling factory.  Schindler's ambition and personal success shines through amidst the Jewish  tragedy and shows how one man, if he has the willpower, can accomplish what  appears to be impossible. Based on the novel by Thomas Keneally (which I  have not yet had the opportunity to read), this movie digs deep into the  human soul and shows how different people are able to survive.There are  many touching moments in this film; in particular, near the end when the  war has been declared over and the Nazis must flee from the Soviet army.  This part and the modern-day segment that follows are both truly  heart-warming tributes. I finished watching this movie for about the fourth  time yesterday, and even though I didn't cry, tears welled up in my eyes  (and this rarely happens when I watch movies).This movie is a must-see  not only for its excellence in the film genre but for the story it presents  to the viewer. Although it is not suitable for young children (due to its  violence and mature content), any mature individual should see it so they  can understand that a spark of good can still exist in a fire of evil. This  movie deserved all of the Academy Awards that it received and will likely  remain in top ten lists for at least the next fifty years. Highly  recommended.	5.0	A phenomenal movie that everyone should see	2000-05-26	101	93	8

But the reasons I have seen posted on this website are incredulous.  One person complained of no character  development.  This is very untrue.  Before we are taken into the  concentration camps, we see Oskar Schindler, up close and personal.  We see  the way he acts with nazis, the way he manipulates Jewish business owners  in the ghetto, the way he treats women, and the way he treats his wife.  All of these are very important to the character of Oskar Schindler.  We  see who he is and what he does, and even how he changes. For the character  of Amon Goethe, the Nazi camp comendent played wonderuflly by Ralph  Fiennes, we are shown from his first scene that he is a cold hearted, evil  man.  We also see that he is incredibly down to earth, considering how evil  he is.  On one hand, with his friends, and around Schindler, he is just  another soldier.  Around the Jews, he is a killer of the worst kind.  He  doesn't care, and he never will.  This is important to the character, and  to the story.  No character development?  I think not.  Each character is  independent, completely.  Not just the main characters either.  Even the  many minor characters, the Jewish families, the little boy, the rabbi, the  Mother and daughter...all very important to the story.  All are develped  independently of each other, and we know who each of them are. As for them  not speaking in germen, what about the WWI classic &quot;All Quiet On The  Western Front&quot; which is also about Germans.  They all not only speak  english, but also have english accent.  Is that a reason not to like the  movie?  of course not, it's just easier.  this is an american made movie  for american audiences.  there would be no point in making every actor  learn a foreign language, and it would not be good in getting the mood  accross, especially knowing how american audiences react to &quot;Foreign  films&quot;.  And if were all in german, that's what would it be labled as.  As for nothing happening....Whatever happened to following a story?  Did  you want explosions?  did you want more dead bodies at the hands of the  Nazis?  It's a real life story about real people in real situations.  The  movie Schindler's List is real.  It is a masterpeice.	5.0	Response to those who did not like it.	1999-09-16	6	4	2

I am 35 years old, and I fancy myself a movie freak. I am not a Jew; in fact I am an Atheist and a very proud one. I mention this because if you read my first sentence, you probably deduced that I was a religious person, thus driving me to make such an impactfull comment about this film. I say this film is the most important film I have ever seen because it shows the ignorance of mankind in its most raw form, bloodshed, on an un-imaginable scale. As silly as it is for a human being to believe in an imaginary old man up in the sky, or living in you chest if you prefer, will save you when you die only if you denounce all other imaginary old men living in the sky while worshiping that particular one, it is just as easy for a group of mislead sheep to attempt to wipe out a race of human beings. Definitely not one of mankind's finest hours. This is a wonderful account of TWO men making a huge difference and saving lives, regardless of the consequences. That's right i said TWO men, because when i discuss this film with other's, they can never tell me who Itzhak Stern is. If it wasn't for him, the list would probably have never been.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3C1JP82J0ACEY	MarisaKG	Schindlers list is about a German man named Oscar Schindler. He was a very wealthy business man. During the Holocaust when the Nazis reigned, he grew more aware of the terrible deaths that awaited the Jewish people. He decided to open a factory and he hired many Jewish people who most likely did not have a chance at life. People say that he opened this factory to hire Jews for cheap labor. If this theory is true, he had quite the change of heart. He did anything in his power to save as many of the Jewish people that he could. It is known that he saved about 1100 Jewish people. He devised a list of names of all the Jewish people he had encountered during this time period and that one list saved 1100 Jewish people from death. Unfortunately at the end of the movie, Oscar Schindler still did not feel like he did much of anything. He was extremely upset that he could not do more, that he could not save more peoples lives.  This movie in my opinion was heartbreaking but it was also heartwarming to see the good he did for the lives of those people.This movie has a lot to do with world religions because during this time period, the Nazis were killing Jewish people because of their religion. The Nazis blamed the Jews for all of the things that went wrong in the world and said it was because the Jewish people were not Christians. It is terrible to know that such horrific things happened to innocent people because they did not practice the same religions. This is why I like the idea of coexisting. Obviously people did not coexist during this gruesome time period, but looking back at these events today, people have learned more about tolerance of other peoples religions.	5.0	Class Movie Review	2011-11-20	1	0	1

Filmed in black and white, it delivers incredible authenticity to the story, but most of all intensity. And whenever the director wants you to particularly focus on a ""movement"" he would add some colors and depicts the dramatics instants to the fullest (the little girl in red jacket and the candle).The story of Oskar Schindler depicted in this movie (whether 100% correct or not, who cares) is breathtaking. He's a man aspiring for power and money, or at least that's what he thought he wants. Scene after scene, oskar schindler will turn to the man who saved the life of more than a 1000 human lives from Nazi's forces.This movie is fulled with little details, and you'll enjoy discovering them one after the other especially that almost everyone will watch this movie more than once."	5.0	Masterpiece	2004-03-05	2	2	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A36EW68H08UOCS	"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!"""	"Steven Spielberg's film achievements stand unreachably tall in Hollywood, and ""Schindler's List"" is his masterpiece.Oskar Schindler was not, by many measurements, a ""good"" man. He was a womanizer and failed several marriages. He was a german war profiteer during World War II, and failed several businesses after the war. He also took steps of bravery and personal sacrifice to preserve the lives of over 1,100 Polish Jews. At the end of the film a graphic tells us that today there are fewer than 4,000 Jews in Poland, but that there are 6,000 descendants of those saved by Oskar Schindler's actions.Liam Neeson also gives the performance of his career as Schindler. He is comfortable cajoling and cavorting with the Nazi's. He is initially only a businessman, and doesn't hesitate to bribe Nazi officials to get preferential business arrangements.Ben Kingsley shines in a performance reminiscent in some ways of his luminescent portrayal of Gandhi. He portrays Itzhak Stern, an accountant Schindler hires to do all the work of Schindler's businesses while Schindler himself is glad-handing the Nazi's and ""adding some panache"" to the business. The central relationship of the film is between Schindler and Stern as the situation becomes increasingly grim for the Jews and Schindler realizes that he can use the same techniques that he has developed as a businessman to create ""safe"" jobs for the Jews.  As long as the Jews are working in Schindler's factory they are spared extermination.  At one point the German's are in danger of losing the ground where Schindler's factory sits and they are ordered to ""liquidate"" the camp again.  Schindler uses all his war profits to ""buy"" the Jews from Goeth, then to relocate them to another factory where they will make artillery ammunition on machines that Schindler has miscalibrated.  Schindler expends his entire fortune to save the Jews in an ammunition factory that never produced a shell that could be fired.Ralph Fiennes steps out onto a limb portraying the terrible Amon Goeth, who rapes and murders and forgives himself as the camp commander over the Jews. To accomplish his goals Schindler befriends even Goeth, and in one memorable scene Oskar appeals to Goeth's vanity to have him stop being so trigger-happy murdering the Jewish prisoners.We see horrors more terrible than any horror film. The Jews are initially all herded into the Krakow ghetto, then it is decided that the ghetto is to be emptied - Nazi soldiers stroll through the streets murdering Jews in cold blood. Later a trainload of Jewish women are mistakenly routed to Auschwitz. Their terror is palpable as they see the smoke billowing from the chimneys over the ovens. They are then stripped and herded into the showers where they have heard the whispers of the ""special treatment"" that the Jews are receiving. The terror of that scene is beyond any fictional machete-wielding movie madman.Spielberg is a master of visual storytelling, and he made a brilliant decision to shoot in black and white, but to use color in just a few shots for a few specific items. In one key scene candle flames burn their brilliant orange and in another mesmerizing use of color Spielberg highlights the red coat of a little girl who is walking through the carnage of the liquidation of Krakow. When we see the red coat again an hour later, our eyes are drawn to it, and we know it's meaning.Spielberg attaches faces to the Holocaust. The ending is one of the most powerful ever seen as the actual survivors are paired with the actors portraying them in the movie. They line up to file past Oskar Schindler's grave and we feel the impact of Schindler's actions.He has not ""saved the world"", but he has saved many, many lives."	5.0	"""Whoever saves one life..."""	2005-07-26	10	9	1

To expand, this is one of the few films I have seen in recent years that has really moved me - so much so that I felt desolate afterwards. The casting is excellent, the mood is gripping and  horrific, the direction is some of the finest ever, and (whilst it seems an  obvious thing to pick up on) the decision to shoot in black and white  really made all the difference. Watching this, it makes me feel so ashamed  to be human - in our history, we have had an unfortunate knack for making  each other suffer, but never has any suffering been so great as that caused  in the holocaust, and the brief coda at Schindler's grave hammers home how  indelible it is in the minds of those who experienced it and survived to  tell the tale. I don't recall how it did at the Oscars, but it at least  deserved to win for Best Actor and Best Director. This is more than a film  - it is a sad testament to an evil period in our history, and everyone  should see it - whether or not you think you can steel yourself, it is  simply something you must do.	5.0	Can this film be ignored?	2000-02-15	3	2	1

The acting, story, script, cinematography, pacing, everything was absolutely top notch. Wow, I thought, Spielberg is really an amazingly talented guy, not just a sentimental entertainer of children and blockbuster audiences. I'd always had mixed feelings about Spielberg as a director. His entertainments can be very engaging (Jaws, Duel, Raiders of the Lost Ark) when they don't get drowned in sticky-sweet mush a la E.T., but I hated, hated, hated, his prior ""serious"" film, The Color Purple. Alice Walker's book had such a sweet, simple ending, with the heroine triumphing over her troubles in a quiet, subtle way. But Spielberg is incapable of such things. Instead of Celie rocking on her porch in her purple pants, he gives us a bunch of people marching around in a sun-drenched field singing--WE'RE HAVING A TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT!!!! I HAVE TO DROP CINEMATIC ANVILS ON THE AUDIENCE'S HEAD BECAUSE THEY'RE SOOOO STUPID THEY WON'T OTHERWISE GET THAT WE'RE HAVING A TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT HERE!!!  He did the exact same thing with Schindler's List. This was an intelligent film, written and performed by talented adults for an intelligent adult audience. But does he trust us??? Heaven forbid!! Schindler gives a sappy, completely out-of-character speech at the end, and once again, we've treated to people marching around in a sun-drenched field singing, because we, the audience, are just toooo f--ing stupid to be trusted to know we're experiencing A TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT!!!!! unless he beats us over the head until we're reduced to a mass of quivering pulp. Immediately my five-star rating dropped to one star because Spielberg showed me he was a brilliant filmmaker and then ruined it because he could not resist the temptation to tell me I'm a moron. I promised myself I'd never see another Spielberg movie and I'm proud to say that's a promise I've kept.For a brilliantly made, unsentimental but profoundly moving treatment of the Holocaust in Poland, see Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" instead."	1.0	7/8 of a Brilliant Film Ruined	2009-06-26	50	10	40

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3O2RCKAMSE9X7	Martin Asiner	One of the darkest, most lamentable eras in the long catalogue of inhuman crime has had the light of recognition thrust upon it in Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST. The viciousness of genocide is so soul-destroying that each new generation needs to be reminded that the gap from internment camp to death camp is hardly a gap at all.  When Hitler's ovens first began their grisly business on a small scale in 1939, it was only a matter of a year before his death camps began to swallow their victims in the millions.  Oskar Schindler was very much like the 'ordinary' German who could see no evil, except for one thing. He began as an industrialist who saw in the Jew a means to an end of money.  He started to change when the distinction between the means and the end began to grow fuzzy.  He finished as a humanitarian who used the former end to safeguard the former means.  This change in his world view was a gradual one.  Liam Neeson, who plays Schindler, has difficulty in broaching this topic, even to himself, but when he does, he determines to be the proverbial one man who can make a difference.  He is not alone, of course.  Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) guides him more by example than exhortation.  But it is primarily these two who must work in solitude to make a dent in the daily killings.  The movie's many graphic scenes of death emphasize the often personal nature of the killing.  Amon Groeth (Ralph Fiennes) kills for joy, but in the end all that his superiors require of him is that he not stop doing so.  The mass killing is done on such a scale that not only the audience must wonder whether the decision to implement the Final Solution must have been happily shared by the entire spectrum of the German people.  The film's not so subtle suggestion is that Spielberg's film,like Goldhagen's book HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONERS, is a blanket condemnation of an entire people.  If only one man like Oskar Schindler could have made the impact that he did, then the viewer is forced to accept that had Germany had more Schindlers, then the List might have been immeasurably longer.  The concluding scene of the survivors meeting to place their little rocks of remembrances on the graves of those who did not survive is a stark reminder for this and all generations to come that the struggle to save human lives must always be a just one, even if faceless bureaucrats dictate otherwise.	5.0	Schindler's List: Saving Even One Life Has Value	2002-08-15	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3RHR3KS6O5HIJ	Martin Ots	An excellent and long-waited movie finally released on DVD by Universal Pictures.Movie itself - 5 stars,disc and case - 1 star: flipper disc (probably has the historical value), crappy paper case (obviously made using the gluestick and scissors), missing title list or booklet, poor list of extras.I bought my DVD disc from Amazon.com hence there`s no need to think that I received some kind of the Estonian DVD version.Yeah, nice work Universal, putting the movie on the flipper disc. It`s really pleasant that we don`t have to buy the movie in the two separate cases released in different months. Or even years.P.S. Maybe the look of the package is intentional? I mean - to make it look like it's handmade by the survivors of the concentration camps? If so, please keep the buyers informed, just to make sure that they`ve not been cheated.	1.0	One fine movie in the crippled form	2004-03-19	55	27	28

Some were crying or trying to hold back tears, some were stunned, some had  completely blank faces, some showed signs of anger; but the overall  atmosphere was one of utter silence. Never in the history of motion  pictures has a film had such an emotional impact upon its constituents.  Upon viewing the video, I was left in a state of awe, wonder, and anger.Those who have defended the Germans in previous critiques must remember  one fact. The two ""World Wars"" of the twentieth century, in which millions  of American lives were taken defending our country and our way of life,  were perpetrated by Germany and the German lust for dominance (but Germany  is only a symbol for any megalomaniac self-deceiving culture). The  Holocaust?...It did occur and in a way that its brutality could not  be  depicted even with this film. The next time it could be you! ... and perhaps  that is Spielberg's message.Though this film is ""R"" rated, it should be  viewed by children...to give them nightmares ... nightmares so that man's  inhumanity to man may never again be perpetrated whether it be by another  Holocaust or by another Inquisition."	5.0	Audience Impact	2000-04-07	3	2	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A22EQ9LRW0EMFK	Mary A. Ferrari	"Schindler's List begins with a slightly frenzied scene showing the Jewish people being registered. It then moves through several scenes introducing Schindler and showing his level of influence. The movie flows through the first three years quickly until the year 1941, when the Jewish people are forced into the Ghetto. At this point, Schindler is seemingly becoming successful in finding Jewish investors to help him acquire a company in return for household items to trade on the black market. It is revealed that Schindler and his ""assistant"" are saving Jewish people by not only forging papers saying that the people are ""essential"" to the community because they are metal workers, but also by teaching the things that they need to know to do their said trade, among other things. Schindler acquires and opens his company, and hires the Jewish people that they have trained. In 1943 the ghetto is raided by the Nazis. The people there are rounded up and sent to the concentration camps, if they are not shot on site. Everyone there is killed. People are killing themselves to avoid being rounded up. Families are torn apart. I could not control my tears at this point. Schindler watches all of this from a hilltop.At one point he begins bringing people in to his factory from the concentration camps; his factory as seen as a safe haven. To me, it gets somewhat confusing as this point, various scenes from the concentration camps, and the lives of Schindler and the Commandant. The prisoners smeared their cheeks and lips with blood to appear healthy enough to avoid selection. I cannot bring myself to describe some of the horrible things that happened. Schindler compiles a list of those people that he can take to his factory- he purchases them all. The women's train is sent to Auschwitz by mistake, but Schindler is able to get them back. He not only saves their lives, he treats them with respect and dignity. Oscar Schindler did amazing and risky things to help whoever he could, however he could. It is good to know that, even in the midst of such atrocities, there are people who still try to do good things. Even at its happiest, and I use the term loosely, it is a heartbreaking movie, made more so by the knowledge that it is true.So, how does this relate to Judaism as a religion? This movie shows of a period when the complete eradication of the Jewish people was supposedly needed for religious purification. One group of, I'll use the term misguided, souls began the terrorizing, torture, and murder of over six million Jewish men, women, and, most vilely, children. While the movie illustrates the most horrific event to take place by mankind, it is only the last on the long list of mass murder and exile that the Jewish people have undergone throughout history. Over and over the Jewish people have been discriminated on simply because of their faith. And yet, through all of these horrors, so many have the strength to retain the religion for which they were prosecuted. I can only hope and pray with every fiber of my being that nothing like the holocaust ever happens again."	5.0	The Latest in a Long Line	2010-04-18	3	0	3

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	"Please note: This review is for the single DVD edition of Schindler's List.Schindler's List is not an easy film to watch; it depicts with great accuracy just some of the horrors of World War Two as the German Nazis did everything they could to exterminate European Jewry. (They almost succeeded; but that's more of a history lesson and not a movie review.) Therefore, I have to warn people that this film is not for the faint of heart; director Steven Spielberg pulls no punches here but the story deserves to be told. Simply put, this is the real-life story of how Oskar Schindler, a Nazi war profiteer and notorious womanizer, decided to save as many Jews from being killed by the Nazis as he could. And Schindler's task was certainly not easy--he essentially dreamt up a way to save Jews from the forced labor and death camps by creating a factory where the ""finest"" pots and pans were made using unpaid Jews as laborers. True, the Jews don't get paid but their lives are spared because Schindler convinces Nazi party officials that they are ""essential workers"" for the German war effort and to sweeten the deal Schindler bribes Nazi officials as well.There are more plot details and an incredibly emotional ending but that's essentially the main theme of the story; I won't write much more to avoid spoiling it all for you. However, I will mention that there are stunning, exceptional performances by Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler who essentially carries the movie flawlessly; Ralph Fiennes who turns in an excellent performance as Nazi official Amon Goeth who delighted in killing Jews in the camps; Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's Jewish and very educated accountant; Caroline Goodall as Emilie Schindler; Jonathan Sagall who portrays Poldek Pfefferberg; Embeth Davidtz who plays Helen Hirsch; Mark Ivanir as Marcel Goldberg; Friedrich von Thun as Rolf Czurda and Norbert Weisser as Albert Hujar among others.The film is a long one (it's over three hours and you have to flip the DVD over to view the last hour or so) but every minute is brilliantly done. The quality of the print and both versions of the sound are excellent, too. Although this is by far not the happiest film I've ever seen it is easily one of the very best. Bonus features include ""Voices from the List;"" ""The Shoah Foundation Story with Steven Spielberg"" and more still! There are optional Spanish and French subtitles as well.Overall, Schindler's List is one of the hardest films I've ever sat through but when it ended I was so moved that I really had a good cry--it is brilliantly done with outstanding, very convincing performances by all involved. I highly recommend this film on DVD for people interested in The Holocaust, Jewish and World War Two history, fans of Steven Spielberg and the actors in it as well as people who appreciate quality film. Great job telling a most important true story, everyone!"	5.0	"""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."""	2014-02-16	1	1	0

DVDs in the UK, yes that includes england, are all region (2) encoded.  Well guess what Einstein, in the U.S., all DVD Players are programmed to play DVDs encoded as region (1).  So, your bloody little UK edition of `Schindler's List' would not play on the DVD Players here.Secondly, with the exception of computers but not as a primary, there are NO primary applications of the PAL Formatting currently in use here in the United States.  Many DVD Players here that are little more than a year old or older &amp; even some new ones will not properly recognize the PAL Format (the European Format) because all commercially/mass produced movie-DVDs in the United States &amp; Canada are created in the NTSC Format.  Just as most all of our related A/V equipment that it would be played on, is programmed to run the NTSC mediums as well.  Further, let us not forget that a 3rd type of Format called SECAM is also used in Europe (France).  Besides, which type of PAL Formatting are you using??  Throughout Europe there are many different *types* of PAL Formats currently in use...*A, B, I, H, G*, so-on &amp; so-on...Thirdly, there is no definitive proof, in the old debate, that either the PAL (at 25 fps - frames per second) or NTSC (at 30 fps) Format is any better than the other.  The sole reason we have ALL these various Formats everywhere is quite simple, marketing strategy.  This is the case basically because unique marketing styles were developed &amp; are in use in different parts of the World.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1A6Q4UYWALIHZ	"Maxine A. Hartley ""Zimra"""	All these descriptions fit Oskar Schindler, who saved 1100 Polish Jews from the Auschwitz ovens during the second World War.Before we get into a critique of the 20th Anniversary DVD of the 1993 movie, let's deal a bit in fact and fiction.Fiction: In his overly-sentimental, romantic way, director Steven Spielberg fudges some facts of the way the list developed and deals in some fantasies about the man Schindler himself.Fact: If you want a realistic account of the man Oskar Schindler and his wife Emile Schindler (whose role in all of this got short shrift from Spielberg in the movie) you should read the book: &#34;Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account.....................&#34; by David Crowe. Crowe deals with the real Schindler and the real source of the list, plus Mrs. Schindler's outstanding role in affairs, both during and after the war.And now to a critique of the 20th Anniversary DVD movie.In the movie, Spielberg creates a legend of the saviour, Oskar Schindler, because he deserves it. (Schindler is portrayed by Liam Neeson.) The movie is shot in black and white without the brilliance of colour so that our sense of the stark, heart-rending facts are not diverted by our sense of colour. Only one scene shows any colour whatsoever, at the time the Krakow ghetto was being violently cleared out. A beautiful little girl is trotting along  the side of the people being cruelly evacuated. Her coat is coloured red. This is a symbol of the blood shed on all of the innocents. The girl herself, although appearing as an innocent child just trotting along unknowingly, proves not to be that unknowing. She goes into a vacated apartment building, ascending to the top apartment, and hides under a bed. The innocence of the girl, then the knowledge of her destination, makes this a chilling scene.Oskar Schindler was born in Brinnlitz,, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic) just south of the Polish border. When the war broke out (September 1, 1939) and the Germans overran Poland, he made his way to Krakow, Poland, and opened a business which produced pots and pans and cutlery, his market being the German forces.  In order to achieve his market,he goes through a lot of bribery with black market goods for the German higher-ups, a lot of procurement of willing women for them, a lot of orgies, a lot of bottles of excellent wines, and the procurement of other rare goods only available through the black market.After the Germans send residents of the Krakow ghetto to be gassed systematically in the death camp, Auschwitz, those still fit to work are sent to a concentration camp set up at Plawitz. The overseer is the sadistic Armon Goeth, who has a villa built on a hill above the camp and just for fun, sits up there on his balcony, randomly shooting unsuspecting Jewish interns walking around the camp. Following the war, Goeth was hung for war crimes. But while he was commandant, his greatest enjoyment - other than attending Oskar's orgiastic drunken parties -  was random shooting of Jew, and/or beating up his Jewish maid.When the Germans were losing, with the Russians advancing from the East and the Allies advancing from the West, the concentration camp was closed down and all workers sent to Auschwitz. These were meant to include the Schindler Jews, who lived in the camp and worked at the Schindler factory during the day.Schindler and his erstwhile Jewish accountant, Isaac Stern, make up a list of all the workers in his factory, and include Goeth's maid. With a lot of bribing, Schindler gets his Jewish work force sent to him. However, through a cruel twist of fate, the women, in a separate train from the men, are sent to Auschwitz. Just as the Marines save the community at the last moment, Schindler, through more bribing (this time with diamonds) gets the women out of there and sent back to his factory. But because of the retreat of the Germans, Schindler's business is to be liquidated.So he returns to his home town of Brinnlitz, Czechoslovakia, and opens a plant there, producing munitions for the Germans. He is aware that the war is nearly over and tells Isaac Stern that if the plant ever produces ammunition, he will be sadly disappointed. At this point, Mrs. Schindler reappears in his life (she had left because he wouldn't give up his womanizing), a clinic is opened for the ill, and she does outstanding work in it (which is only alluded to in the movie).You'll want to see what happens to Schindler and the workers once the war ends and the Jews reward him in their everlasting gratitude.Oskar Schindler is saviour and hero to the 1100 survivors and, in 1993, their 6,000 descendants. This DVD includes interviews with some of those survivors, which is a feature which should not be missed.The very end of the movie switches to full colour. Scene: Israel; Oskar Schindler's grave; a parade to put a stone on his grave (an honour) by some of the 1100 whose lives were alluded to in the movie. Emile Schindler is there.  The widow of  Isaac Stern is there, accompanied by Ben Kingsley, who brilliantly portrays Isaac Stern in the movie. At the end of this scene, a tall, bearded shadow of a man places two roses on Schindler's grave. It is Steven Spielberg.If this scene does not bring tears to your eyes nothing ever will.I gave this movie five stars since the movie in itself is brilliant, one of the greats of all time. Through the story of the Krakow ghetto and the Schindler Jews (as they called themselves) Steven Spielberg presents a brilliant microcosm of the macrocosm of Jewish suffering at the hands of the Germans during the second World War. The elimination of six million Jews was the result of technology gone stark raving mad, the evil vision of one madmen which infected a whole nation.And Schindler, a deeply flawed human being, was still and always will be, a saviour.	5.0	black marketeer, insatiable womanizer, saviour	2013-09-06	0	0	0

It is a beautiful film, sad, (it makes me cry everytime I see it) but reminds me that even in the mist of evil there is goodness within people.I love Liam Neeson in this movie.

Spielberg is a genius and I don't have to say he has other great films, but this is his absolute masterpiece. Great cinematography, and the black and white effect is fenomenal. John Williams, my favorite composer made beautiful and hartfelt music.I have seen other holocaust movies and they don't compare to this one. I agree that the actual holocaust is much worse than this, and it's needless to say that we shouldn't call a great movie that shows such atrocities, but this movie, rather than just showing the crude truth, it's there, we know, and we feel the pain somehow, but it also shows the greatness of people that endured to survive (all Holocaust survivors), and that people such as Oskar Schindler (like so many others of his time) that didn't have to worry about a thing (they were protected by money and powerful allies), turned his life around to help others, and this was a matter of life and death.This movie has to be in my DVD collection!

Nothing short of harrowing, this brilliant epic simply cannot be compared with any other film, no one has ever made anything quite like it.The Black and White is a little disappointing, I understand Spielberg wanted to convey the feeling of news reel footage, that since that's how we are used to seeing the war that the film would seem more real to us this way. How seeing it in B&W; makes it more reel I don't know, I think the more hyper-washed out colors of Saving Private Ryan worked better. However, I don't complain, the one color, red, on a little girls dress is used to get your attention and jerk your emotions, it works and it's the mark of a master film maker.Why then the crappy, two sided, DVD presentation with the gatefold cover that comes covered in glue from the ""temporary"" page inserted for retail browsing.Not only do they print the Side A / Side B tiny in the center ring, but you have to get up 2/3 through the film and eject and flip the thing.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2MLKTAWFRCSCR	Megan Gutierrez	"Schindler's List was a story that took place in the 20th century during the Holocaust where6 million European Jews were murdered by the Nazi's under the leadership of Adolph Hitler, in Germany during WWII. Mr. Schindler ran a factory with Jew workers, making big profit. At the time of the concentration camps and Auschwitz, Schindler became attached and empathetic to the Jew workers. He paid for over 1,000 Jews to work in his new ""factory"" in order to save them from execution. The war ended and the 1,000 plus Jews were saved and free from oppression.The movie began when the systematic oppression started with orders to make all Polish Jews to move into towns, where walled ghettos were created to confine them. The Jews were forced to wear a yellow or white badge with the Star of David on it to reveal their status. In the movie, they had the Jews lined up to be assigned their ""new"" jobs and one man was out-raged because he had a high education, but was only given menial labor. Near the end of the movie the women of Schindler's bought Jews, were transported to Auschwitz by accident. Auschwitz was one of the large-scale death camps that had been setup in 1942 to enforced Hitler's ""final solution"" - the total extermination of all Jews in Europe. Form the ghettos Jews were transported by cattle cars (which many suffocated to death) to the concentration camps. Schindler's List showed a main example of the over-crowding in the cars, with the people starving and thirsty in the heat. Schindler had pretended to make a joke of this by pretending to be cruel and having the cars hosed down with water. The Nazi officers considered this as Schindler giving the Jews false hope on purpose, when Schindler was really trying to early their suffering.Schindler's List was a riveting movie that shows a horrible time in history up close.

Yokeley	Liam Neeson plays troubled factory owner Oskar Schindler who is caught up in the brutality of Nazi Germany during World War 2. Schindler is a shrewd businessman who endeavors to save Jews by way of 'buying' them, so to speak, in order to employ them in his steel factory. Throughout the movie, we get a sense of the hatred that fueled the Holocaust, but we also see some glimpses of humanity and love for fellow man at play.Schindler uses his wealth as well as his position in business to bring many Jewish men and women to work in his factory. Unlike the inhumane work camps that the German government interred the Jews in, Schindler provided good working conditions as well as adequate housing, and other basic necessities.As we follow Schindler's work through the movie, we see that he is more and more despairing of his ability to help as many as he would like. Finally, we end with Schindler feeling beaten down and inadequate, despite his personally saving thousands of people from death.This movie is an important part of understanding the Holocaust and it's human cost. So that the saying &#34;never again&#34; stays true, we must remember that we are all part of the human experience. Schindler's List can help in this endeavor by helping bring an understanding of &#34;the other&#34;.	5.0	Schindler's List is a must see	2013-11-24	2	2	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AUGABW5AS2OXM	Melvin Hunt	This movie testifies to the genius of Stephen Speilberg. This movie will make an impression on you after you view it. This movie details the activities of Oscar Shindler and the valuable help that he gave toward saving the lives of Jews during World War II. Many of his tactics held his life on the line. The very inhuman nature of the Nazi concentration camps are displayed by Speilberg in this epic movie. The cruelty of the Nazis is also put on display thanks to the fine movie. This is a deeply moving  film. The Holocaust was brought to the forefront thanks to this movie. The plight of the Jews during the Nazi era has never been better shown. Hats off to Stephen Speilberg for a job well done.	5.0	One Of The All Time Best!	2001-06-06	1	1	0

Because an older family member had never seen the movie, we viewed it again with her and I viewed it with a different perspective!  I was able to see more horrible details than in my earlier viewing and was also able to connect the descriptions of Hitler's inner circle of men such as Goebbels, Himmler, Goethe, Goering and their roles in leading the destruction of Jews.  This movie continues to be an eye-opener as we look at our own politics--lest we become so beset with tunnel vision that we refuse to accept each others' beliefs and work toward compromise.	5.0	Lessons to Learn!	2014-05-06	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1Y6KW8HYJWFZC	"M. Gonya ""rawker"""	Everyone already knows how great and critically acclaimed this film  is so this is a review of the DVD. This will probably go down as one of the biggest let-downs (for me) in DVD anticipations. Sure you have the widescreen version with great sound on DVD, but thats it. For People who already have the VHS versions, you pay more money for a little better picture and sound and you get cheated on features. Instead of a great commentary or documentary you get more preachy propaganda Spielburg dumped onto the second side of the disc. I have a feeling that Spielburg wanted the film to be the highlight of the  DVD and not the extras, but in my opinion, extras never hurt...especially if your going to price it like it has tons of extras on it. If you want to be emotionally, or spiritually moved watch the movie, you don't really need to see the lousy extras. My advice is to only buy the widescreen DVD verion if you don't already have it in VHS.	2.0	Bad excuse for a DVD edition	2004-03-11	21	16	5

Of course the subject matter is distressing, sometimes we need to be distressed. In the prewar years my own country (the US) was sitting on it's hands, ignoring what was happening under it's own nose. NEVER AGAIN! I need to watch this film from time to time as a wake up call for what can happen to innocent people when we hide our heads in the sand. This movie came out long after I first went in to the military but I've never seen a better recruiting tool. And it's not just the moral lesson from history. It's photography, editing, acting, music was perfect. In reading about this film I've learned that the incidents actually happened in real life. Such as the little girl in the red coat, the shower seen, and so on. If you're one of the few who hasn't seen this, by all means watch it.	5.0	Flawless	2014-02-25	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1SMWZVAKDPZU7	"Michael D. Kuhlman ""koolman"""	"This is the first time Spielberg embraced the R rating, after grappling for years with the MPAA, despite many violent scenes in his films, for the more ""family-friendly"" PG or, after the edgy violence in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, PG-13, to cram as many butts in theater seats and thus make as much money as possible.  Schindler's List, oddly enough, was supposed to be an obscure little art film about an unpleasant subject that wasn't supposed to make much money, and ended up being a worldwide phenomenon.  His subsequent movies, whatever their MPAA rating, have been braver, and better for it ever since.While we've certainly seen moments of brutality depicted in Spielberg's earlier films, here is the first time he shows shameless murder, at point-blank range.  The murders depicted in this film, Luger shots to the head, sniper rifle shots from rooftop, women almost gassed, etc., etc., are far more horrifying than any shark attack in Jaws, any fistfight in Indiana Jones, any beating in The Color Purple or Empire of the Sun.While the film is undoubtedly Spielberg's darkest work to date, darker than Minority Report, and even darker than the even more extremely violent Saving Private Ryan, I still remember there being a few more shots in Schindler's initial theatrical release, a release that was apparently recalled by Spielberg, to trim or replace some of these more graphic shots of sadistic violence:1)  During the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto, when the boy that ran off to escape death, is being dragged back by two German soldiers and is shot, a Jewish man screams ""You bastard!"", and one of the German soldiers levels his Luger at the man's head and fires.  The man's skull, under the cap he's wearing, fractures, and blood spurts out.  This shot is completely cut from this version.2)  When Goethe hits Helen the first time in the basement at night, in the initial version, she just stands there, stoicly, but quivering with tears, as blood streams from her nose, and he hits her again.  In this version, blood still streams from her nose, but she has her hand over her face.4)  While it's not a violent scene, when Schindler is thrown in prison for ""violating the Race and Resettlement Act"" (kissing a Jewish girl), his prison mate tells Schindler why he was in prison, then asks ""And what about you?""  In this version, the scene picks right up with ""And what about you?""4)  At the end of the film, when we see Goethe saying ""Heil Hitler"" and finally hanged for his crimes against humanity, in the initial version, his body continues to dangle side-to-side as we see the title explaining his fate.  In this version, the image simply freezes as we see the title.While some of these shots are no doubt sick and sadistic, for puristic reasons, it would be nice to see them re-inserted again, to see Spielberg's full vision.  Perhaps, on blu-ray, Spielberg will release R and Unrated Versions (!).  Apparently, the director felt, and rightly so, that he went too far in these shots.  The excisement of these shots hardly ""softens"" the film.  It still packs a whallop, an affront, to one's own morality, sensibility and sanity.  The casual, even cavalier behavior of the Germans, particularly in the night of the Krakow ghetto massacre, when Jews hiding, in a piano, under a bed, in closets, etc., are machine gunned while a young German soldier plays the piano, presumably to block out the horrible noise, and two other German soldiers appear in the doorway and ask him, in German supremacy mindset, ""Est Bach?""  ""Nein, Mozart"", is an abomination that will make you sick.Being, myself, of German descent, I'm ashamed of my own race when I watch this film.  How could a people so classy, so educated, so family-oriented, so full of love, as the Germans, commit such atrocities?  While I'm not condoning their behavior by any means, one has to look at history and remember that the state of the German economy was in absolute shambles after WWI, and Hitler pulled Germany out of its economic depression (largely by confuscating all the money and possessions from the Jews), so the German people revered him as a kind of demigod.  In their eyes, he could do no wrong.  Hitler said ""the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it"", and he concocted the biggest lie in human history, that all the problems of the world were attributed to the Jews.  The Germans were willing to sweep any and all atrocities under the rug in order to keep their own lives intact.  Many of the death camps were located right in the middle of German neighborhoods.  The fact is, any German who opposed the Fuerher would simply be shot or sent to concentration camp along with the rest of the innocents, so the German people could do nothing to prevent this Holocaust, except let Jewish people hide in their attics or under their floorboards, which many German people did, to their own danger.Who can fault a people, the Jews, for being brilliant, and for having a talent for numbers, for business?  As Geothe's character says, prior to the Ghetto massacre, ""They came here with nothing.  Nothing.  And they flourished.""  And what is wrong with that?  We can LEARN from each other, and DO BUSINESS WITH each other, not slaughter each other!  Such is the nature of hate and intolerance.Itsaak Stern's accountant is thoroughly obsessed with keeping Schindler's company running, not in the interest of making a profit, but in the interest of saving lives.  Schindler, initially only interested in profiteering off free Jewish slave labor ""Poles cost more.  Why should I pay Poles?"", after witnessing the horror of the ghetto massacre, and then being visited by a young Jewish woman who passes herself off as a rich financier to tell him his factory is perceived as a ""haven"" and begs him to spare her parents (to which Schindler angrily reacts ""Subjectivities are illegal!"", but then has a heart-to-heart conversation with Stern about the murdering behavior of Geothe), Schindler finally relents and gives up his pricey wristwatch so the woman's parents can be taken to his factory, to safety.  At that moment, Schindler realizes that he has the power to save lives.  This scene moves me to tears.While there were certainly many more opportunities for murder, including showing people actually being gassed in the gas chambers (going into seizures, vomiting, etc.) and babies being tossed from rooftops and shot like skeet pigeons before they splatted on the pavement below like watermelons (which Spielberg said, while he knew it actually happened, he, rightly, didn't want to show it), this film is by no means soft.  It is the definitive telling of one of the most horrible times in human history, and, I agree with everyone else here, it should be shown in grade school, to kids, some of whom are bullies, as that is where intolerance begins, to nip this in the bud for future generations, so that this kind of atrocity never happens again.Brilliant.  Genius.  A grisly, mostly black-and-white masterpiece.  A lighted candle in the dark.  A must see.  Steven Spielberg and all else involved in bringing this darkness to light on the screen, have earned their angel wings in heaven."	5.0	Pulls No Punches!	2012-07-07	1	1	0

This movie is all of these and more.  The movie portrays Oskar Schindler, a German capitalist who takes advantage of the Nazi's use of  Jews as slave labor.  As the movie progresses we see Schindler (portrayed  wonderfully by Liam Neeson) begin to see the evil all around him and his  determination to do anything he can to save his workers.  This movie does  not cut anything-we are forced to watch the horrors the Nazi's performed on  the Jews.  Ralph Finnes as the horrible Nazi Amon Geth should have won the  Oscar he was nominated for.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A32WI9J3ZC5I58	Michael Leviton	It makes me very sad that people so love Steven Spielberg movies.  Spielberg only makes movies about the most simplistic emotions in the most simple ways.  Most of the time it boils down to a child's feeling of fear running away from a monster.  Is there really any difference for Spielberg between running from a killer shark or a killer dinosaur or a killer Nazi?  I don't think there is.  Showing bad things happening to people and saying, &quot;Here's a great holocaust movie&quot; is so insulting.  It's the worst thing one can possibly do to take something very complicated and through propogandistic techniques (cutting between party scenes and scenes of suffering etc.) make it look simple.  I beg you not to go for the cheap and easy way out.	1.0	Nazis and Sharks and Dinosaurs	2001-07-05	114	35	79

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3HNISFUXY7HJT	Michelle	"This movie was very entertaining ""Schindler's List."" This movie takes place back during WWII in Poland, with a German who was part of the Nazi party. This man went from being in the war to being a savior for the Jews. Liam Neeson who is the star character for Oskar Schindler, uses the slave labor during the war to get a lot of money. He is seen in this movie as a semi-hero who also had flaws of womanizing, greed, alcoholism, and personal dominate. He was looked at the person who was in the war to make only money to get rich and the thought of having Jews and Nazi's would be in his way for success. However, he risks his life in the movie to save the Jewish people. With this being said his change within the film to help the Jews was remarkable. He gave up his wealth and to play the Nazi's for his own benefit. He wanted to help the Jews from the Nazi anti-Semitism and harsh cruelty. In the end he saves over 1000 Jews. This movie relates to the actual Holocaust on modern Jews and also affects those who are not Jewish. The Holocaust was a very sad and detrimental part of history. This movie also displayed the human cruelty of the Nazi camps where Jews were used as targets for example, the lives of twenty or plus people would be taken for one man's actions. That was said to see during this movie what the Jewish people had to go through during the Holocaust. This event in human history during the 20th century of Europe was a horrible time. My impression of this man was that if he could save one live he would try to save all lives for the Jewish people. The Nazi's were known to be evil and cruel people who wanted nothing but the satisfaction to see the Jewish people die. I found myself so moved and upset at the same time that the Jews had to go through this harsh and terrible period in History."	5.0	One of the most moving Movie's of all time!	2010-11-21	1	0	1

My father is post war U.S. soldier and mother postwar West German!She accepts that as war and has been flying a U.S.flag long before 9-11-01 happened.I guess my review drifted of course abit,the movie and actors were great but alot of innocent people died in that war,not just one group!Also Hollywood sometimes gets critisized for violence but rarely gets praise they sometimes deserve,people have been killing each other long before Hollywood was around,sometimes mankind can be worse than animals to each other and over and over again.

And yet  he risked his life, and lost all his ill-gotten gains, to save Jews from  the Holocaust.Schindler's Nazi counterpart, Goeth, is a study in  amorality. He isn't insane, or some kind of monster; he does what he does  because he wants to, simple as that.This is a marvelous story,  beautifully told by Spielberg, of the good and evil within each of us.	5.0	He who saves one life saves the world in time...	2000-02-17	6	5	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3IB1W0SVED0Z3	"Mike Powers ""mkp51"""	Meet Oskar Schindler. A German living in occupied Poland during World War II. A member in good standing of the Nazi party. A womanizer, a war profiteer...and ultimately a man of conscience. A man who became one of the great unsung heroes and humanitarians of the war.&quot;Schindler's List&quot; chronicles Oskar Schindler's spiritual odyssey from war profiteer to humanitarian and hero.  Winner of seven Academy Awards in 1993, including Best Picture, this  harrowing and heart-rending film is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, and perhaps one of the finest and most important movies ever made.  It depicts Schindler's ultimately successful attempt to rescue 1,100 Jews from Hitler's &quot;Final Solution&quot; by getting them to safety outside Poland.Dynamic performances abound in this beautiful movie,  Especially noteworthy are Liam Neeson as the suave Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as the monstrously depraved Nazi colonel, Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley as the dignified, principled Jewish prisoner Itzhak Stern.&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is definitely not light entertainment!  This beautiful movie allows viewers to feel like they're actually a part of one of the darkest, most horrific periods in history. (I'm sure this is the reason the film was shot in black-and-white, with only minor &quot;colorized&quot; bits included.)  The story of the Holocaust needs to be told over and over again, in hopes  that future generations can understand the horrors perpetrated on an entire race of people and prevent future occurrences.  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is perhaps one of the best and most effective vehicles for telling that story I've ever experienced.	5.0	A cinematic masterpiece!	2001-02-21	280	243	37

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3UVGHUDOY77YR	MissPammy	This film is hands down the best one I've ever seen on the Holocaust, and there have been a couple of others that were very good.  Liam Neeson's performance is stellar.  As the Nazi industrialist who gradually realizes what the Nazis are doing to the Jews and has compassion for the Jews, Neeson gives a nuanced performance that is believable and skillfully done.  The soundtrack is artfully matched to the film's action and provides cues at every turn as to what the mood and context in each scene are.  Ralph Fiennes as the psychopathic Amon is chilling.  Some of the devices that Spielberg uses in the film are pure genius, such as the saying and typing of each name on the list.  This burns the memory of the names into the brains of the viewers and indirectly pays tribute to the real people the names belong to, some of whom appear at the end of the movie to pay homage to the real Oskar Schindler.  The little girl in the red coat is a silent but haunting character that embodies the senseless tragedy of the Holocaust.  This movie is both inspiring and difficult to watch.  It is so exquisitely crafted, moment by moment, that you cannot take your eyes off it in most scenes, yet the horror and depravity of Nazi brutality brands your heart with a searing recognition of the unreasoning inhumanity that is both maddening and tragic at the same time.  Whatever you think of Spielberg or the actors in the film, you will very likely never forget the experience of viewing it, and that was undoubtedly Spielberg's intent.	5.0	Incredibly moving, unforgettable	2014-05-02	1	1	0

Long ""bookchef"""	Without question one of the most important films ever made and a masterpeice of acting and filmaking, and like all of the best movies ( except maybe The Godfather) is almost all a true story with elements cleaned up for ease of narration.Those who complain about the dramatization should realize that every big budget film must have elements that make it compatible for mass audience appeal in order to be made. Spielberg just does not make documentaries. It's just not realistic. Also many negative reviews complain about scenesthat were exactly from the book and were factual ( Like the water instead of gas from the shower scene)as reported by the victims. There were a few instances that were inaccurate ( The Germans did not have a 45 mm shell, their were 37 or 50 mm, upto 75 and 88mm and so on.. the 45 is an american caliber, also, The true role of Metiek Pemper was combined with Izak Stern's, Amon Goth was arrested by the ss and sacked for corruption, etc and was gone by the time Oskar moved the factory to Brinnlitz etc...The biggest joke is people complaining about having to get up out of their comfortable seats in the paradise that is modern america and to flip over a disc while watching a true story film about people that underwent the worst horror in human history!

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	Steven Spielberg finally got the long awaited respect he deserved as director when he won the Oscar for his 3 hour 16 minute epic.  And now this excellent 20th Anniversary Blu ray finally arrives.  Spielberg shot in black and white because he says that is how he pictures all the events in his mind.  As a kid he had seen some photos and they were B & W.  With a splash of color at the beginning and end, he also tosses in an effective shot of a little girl walking through chaos wearing a red coat.Brilliant movie making but certainly not a movie that can be casually watched.  Nor is it a film that requires regular viewing.  Frankly it is difficult assignment most of the time.  In spite of the upbeat aura of Schindler's great good, the film also accurately depicts the horrors the Nazis bestowed upon Jews throughout Eastern Europe.  As one might expect, we see superb performances especially by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes.  A masterpiece for all time.This Blu ray transfer includes a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio that matches the original.  Spielberg personally supervised the high definition transfer and the lossless audio (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1) restoration of the film from the 35mm film original negative. Special features include:Voices from the List: Documentary featuring a number of testimonies and stories from men and women who survived the Holocaust thanks to Oskar Schindler.USC Shoah Foundation Story with Steven Spielberg	5.0	A masterpiece for all time	2013-01-23	94	85	9

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1T607FKUSPQBS	"""monna"""	I watched Schindler's List as part of a required class. I didn't have much interest in it before; like other movies I'd seen reviews of, I thought it looked interesting and that I might want to see it sometime.  But now  after watching it, I can say without hesitation that it was one of the best  films I have ever seen. Not only was the quality itself good, but the story  and its portrayal was very moving.  The ability to make a deeply  touching movie is sometimes lost in our culture, but I think that Spielburg  has undoubtedly made his mark with this masterpiece. I found myself wanting  to cry as I witnessed the plight of the Jews. I felt intense anger at  Geothe for his heartless treatment of his fellow humans.  The ability to  empithize with the characters must be in any movie in order for it to be  called great. Schindler's List is a classic, pure and simple. It is  heart-wreching and thought provoking, yet is not without touches of humor  and lightheartedness.  Some might dispute the violence of the film,  calling it too graphic. But I think that its graphic nature is the most  important element. This film is designed to show what the Holocaust was  truly like; how terrible it really was. If the violence was removed, the  original goal would have been lost.  Only through being shown the true  evil and cruely that humans are capable of, and what they have done, can we  be sure not to allow history to repeat itself.	5.0	Schindler's List shows the true horror of the Holocaust	2000-04-30	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2BXS4GU3L6RJY	MovieFann	Who can forget 1992's 5 Oscar masterpiece which elevated Steven Spielberg as one of the most honored film directors of all time?  This story is based upon true events of the dark days of World War II in Europe when the Jewish persecution and subsequent innilhation (labeled &#34;the final solution&#34; by the German SS, the most ruthless arm of the Nazi Party) was more horrific and inhumane than the bullets, bombs, bayonets faced by soldiers in battle.  While the Geneva Convention governed the &#34;rules of war&#34; no such protection was afforded the Jews in Europe.  Oskar Schindler, an enterprising industrialist, forged an uncomfortable alliance with Jewish tradesmen, accountants and captives he would label &#34;skilled workers&#34; in support of the German war effort and in doing so, save them from the gas chambers.......Liam Neeson portrayed Schindler as a conflicted, morally corrupt businessman who saw more profit in the Jews ( rather than an ethnic annoyance); his shrewd dealings with dishonest SS Officers to further his success helped save over 1000 men, women and children from the gas chamber.  Ralph Fiennes (I believe his first starring role) cast as the  Camp Commandant was excellent as an evil, lusty and morally void demon whose unpredictable moods always had a fatal result on the interred populace; Ben Kingsley, in an emotionally strained performance as Schindler's accountant and bookeeper, was believable and was the heart of the story.  Spielberg's masterful use of lights and shadows (filmed in stark Black and White) conveyed the dreary hopelessness of camp internees and the endless horror they must have experienced when at any moment their lives could end; families separated and segregated as cattle would be preparing for slaughter....The relationship between Neeson and Kingsley, at times tempestous, was the true story here; both were believable  despite the master-slave role.  Fiennes, like the Karloff Monster, inciting terror and demonstrating a mercurial temperament (witness the scene in which he climbs out of his bed leaving his naked lover, casually strolls to the corner where a rifle rests, picks it up, adjusts the telescopic sight, strolls out onto the balcony where he scans the camp yard below, sees a woman pausing from her chore and he coldly raises his rifle and shoots her in the head, calmly rests it against the railing and returns to his bedroom unnerved by his act) The inhumanity demonstrated by the Nazis has been well documented throughout history and this film is but a microcosm of their dubious deeds; I do not remember why I chose to add this film to my library but in watching it for the second time I found its message, story and portrayals to be as emotional and compelling as it was twenty one years earlier; I cried at the closing scene and ending credits---my testimony to this remarkable film.	5.0	A Second Look	2013-04-02	1	1	0

This really comes and no shock, as Saving Private Ryan, his second greatest feature, got similar treatment.  But since Schinlder's list is the most important and personal work of Speilberg's career, one would expect him to have done more in terms of extras.  From the razor-thin box to the single DVD contained inside, Schindler's packaging just FEELS wrong.But I'm really reviewing the film, and as it stands, it's one of the greatest pictures ever made.It's odd that Speilberg's greatest accomplishment took forever to make it to DVD.

Ralph Fiennes is a psychotic monster who can be seen in the US Congress today and that is repeated throughout the film as we see the portrayal of evil in every scene and feel the pressure for every minute.  Every soldier knew he was killing an unarmed person, destroying their lives, being devils, and they enjoyed it.  No dragging of their feet but goose step marches into evil.  Speilberg gave this film everything and knew how to play the open beats, to leave silence when needed.  The original B&W film was enhanced by Tom Ogburn's Tomakote film process application and the HD transfer is marvelous.  Liam Neeson still has not found a better role that fits him so well physically and artistically.  If only Speilberg could use that enormous talent of his to as powerfully document the experience of American Indians or Blacks or poor Whites.  Thank God he was able to bring it all together for his own people, as he should.	5.0	Genius at Work	2013-07-21	0	0	0

This is one movie that I can speak intelligently about. Steven Speilberg(Best Director) does an outstanding and profound job at directing this tale that talks about the manufacturer that saved thousands of lives. right after the big success of Jurassic Park Speilberg manages to put an outstanding cast together including Ralph Fienes and Ben Kingsley. Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson) puts together a factory for the jews so that way they can work hard and maybe make money at the same time. Meanwhile Arizto (Fiennes) runs his concentration camp right across from Schindlers factory. He does an outstanding job as a mean German Nazi. Killing people from gas chamebers or by his own desire. Ben Kingsley plays Schindlers helper and counter does a profound job. How the General public will take to a three-hour,fifteen minute, black and white epic. This movie is in black and white. This epic anout the holacaust with no major stars is another matter.:George Perry said in his book. Catherine Goodall is Schinlders wife. This movie is a very powerful five star epic on its own. It shows what these people had to go through, but what it felt like people will never understand. An excellent picture.

I had a hard time at the Holocaust Museum in DC and thought this film would be a similar heartbreaking and sickening experience.  It was not.  The random executions and dehumanizing treatment were rough to watch, it's true, but the story itself is a happy one with a mostly happy ending.  Hard to believe that one man could make such a difference, and the included documentary that features survivors' interviews is a nice companion piece.  One other thing:  there seem to be invented dramatic moments in the story (a train accidentally rerouted to Auschwitz, a group of prisoners herded into the showers).  While watching the documentary, I discovered that these climactic moments were lifted directly from the true story, and not fabricated to advance the plot or strengthen conflict.	5.0	Authentic and surprisingly uplifting	2007-05-18	1	1	0

Because his story takes place during the horrible things that happened to so many people during World War II, you may have to turn your head away (not your heart) a number of times; nonetheless it was a very interesting movie and I was moved by Schindlers' ultimate kindness in the end.  In the beginning his &#34;kindness&#34; wasn't quite the real thing, as it was based on his own selfishness, but as time goes on, his heart is changed and does turn towards genuine love and the desire to help protect and save some of the Jewish people, as much as he was able to do.	4.0	Very difficult to endure subject matter, but with that thread of human goodness in the middle of Hell	2013-05-15	2	2	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A37AFOVUD87LPQ	"Nataly Brogsdale ""nurse2013"""	Based on a true the Schindler `s List is a story about  Oskar Schindler, who is a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazi's now ruling Germany. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils and then uses bribes to win military contract. He also hires an accountant Itzhak Stern  to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a very dependable labor force. For Stern, who is also a Jew this job could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. Then  n 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goet who is a raging alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony for fun. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. He then begins to demands more workers in effort to keep more Jews alive and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from death at a concentration camp.This movie is very inspiring and relates greatly to World Religion in this time period Hitler was out to make an Aryan race which included blonde hair and blue eyes which left many Jews out of that category. To better accomplish this goal he isolated them and sent them to concentration camps to be killed. Judaism was not accepted because of Hitler's belief but the events of the Holocaust made the Jewish people stronger and made sure that their children and the rest of the world know what they went through so that it would never be forgotten or happen again.	5.0	Amazing really inspiring!	2010-05-08	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A286CZAI1M80R3	Neoncloudff	This is one of the most challenging films to review. Not because it's complex or difficult to follow, but because it is quite simply one of the most intense films I have ever seen and the level of emotion is...quite unlike most movies of today.Widely considered Steven Spielberg's crowning achievement, Schindler's List is a powerful, utterly devastating and raw glimpse at the horrors of the Holocaust. It's also a profound character epic, transforming a man who prides himself on leisure and his bountiful fortune into one who sacrifices it all to save the lives of many.The first element of note is the phenomenal cast. Liam Neeson leads as Oskar Schindler, and is tremendous. A real, raw, and emotional performance. Ben Kingsley plays Itzhak Stern, a troubled Jewish accountant who helps Schindler in his character transformation. His performance is also incredibly genuine, ever representing some of the best casting in film. Rounding out the fantastic cast is Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a sadistic psychopath with nothing but hate for the Jewish people. It's an awesome cast that carries emotional weight and intensity, but written with that signature Spielbergian style.Right off the bat, you can also see the Schindler's List is in black and white. This visual style is striking and refreshing and adjusting to it is remarkably easy. The way the film is shot is more intimate and personal as compared to other Spielberg outings, and the black and white really augments the experience. The sets are recreated with such incredible attention to detail; Everything from the Ghetto at Krakow to the terribly disturbing Auschwitz, Spielberg simply doesn't take you to these places but puts you in them, creating a sense of tangible immersion in these places. John Williams also composed the score for Shindler's List, and is among one of his most original works to date. Straying away from the big and boisterous action packed scores he usually composes, the score for Schindler's List is a more subtle and emotional score, and I was taken away by the beautiful music (the theme is especially memorable).Being a Holocaust film, Schindler's List has no shortage of intense grit and violence. It's worthy of note because of the brutality of it all, recreating some of the darkest moments of human history with nothing held back. I cried more than a few times during Schindler's List because of these scenes; it's so emotionally poignant and it gets the point across with almost blistering intensity, and if not for the transformation of Schindler the entire film would fall apart. But because of the striking visuals, intimate and strong performances, and that Spielbrgian branded style, Schindler's List shines as a near-perfect balance between intense violence and story.I will say that Schindler's initial transformation seems rather sudden, but when between the rock and the hard place that Oskar Shindler was in I can see his change of heart. Other than this seemingly dramatic change of character, This film is a masterpiece.It's all just so incredibly disturbing, powerful, emotional, intense, and violent that Schindler's List becomes ingrained into your mind. And that's a good thing. While all films that win Best Picture are credible in their own right, I can safely say that Schindler's List rises above most for one simple reason: Schindler's List is an important film. In a time when people are denying the Holocaust even happened (for some foolish reason), Schindler's List is a graphic and raw recreation of an event in history that should never be forgotten. Brilliantly casted, well conceived, directed, shot and tremendously powerful Schindler's List is a masterpiece film that, now in 2013, has stood the test of time and will undoubtably remain a classic for ages to come.Blu-Ray Review: Picture quality is surprisingly good, with only one or two moments with obvious visual flaw.  The sharp remaster is somewhat interesting, as I believe that black and white films are better with a softer edge instead of razor sharp HD quality, but this strikes just the right balance of soft edges yet distinct detail.  The audio is as good as it can be. It isn't laser sharp, but isn't distracting either. In terms of a remaster it's awesome. The packaging is in a nice collectable box, and a 3 disc set (2 DVD's - parts 1&2) and 1 Blu-Ray. Digital Copy included is both iTunes (gladly it's HD) and UV.5/5 - A classic	5.0	The List is Life; A Classic Reborn	2013-03-16	4	3	1

Marvellous - not. Why was this splendid film not given the respect it deserves and given a proper, up-to-date DVD release?? I thought flip-over discs went out in about 1999?I waited ages for Schindler's List to get a DVD release, and then this dog's breakfast.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	?Schindler?s List? is the engrossing masterwork about the holocaust from director, Steven Spielberg, a broad and far reaching example of all the human emotion and poignancy that motion pictures are capable of achieving under the right circumstances. For this reviewer at least, there is a single moment worth noting in which Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) pulls out his pistol and nonchalantly murders a Jewish engineer as she stands by the side of the road. In most cases, Hollywood has often had a way of glamorizing such acts so that they appear staged for the camera. But in this case, the sudden loss of life is handled with such meticulous craftsmanship that for a moment the viewer becomes overwrought in what appears to be a very genuine and sudden loss of human life. Of course, the film is not centered on Goeth but on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) a German industrialist who, along with his Jewish book keeper, Itzak Stern (Ben Kingsley) sets out to rescue hundreds of Jews from their fate at the concentration camps by employing them in his factory right under the Nazis noses. Neeson?s performance is perhaps a bit too subdued to be believed, excelling more as the faux Nazi sympathizer than the hero that he actually was. The visceral score by John Williams brings all the plot elements together with a tragic musical crescendo.The DVD transfer is, for the most part, very nicely balanced. The black and white picture exhibits a solid gray scale with deep blacks. Film grain seems a bit excessive during the latter half of the movie with background information breaking apart because of sometimes excessive pixelization, edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details. The audio is 5.1 surround and exhibits a very rich and nicely spread sound field with considerable bass. Universal has made ?Schindler?s List? available as both a two disc bare bones edition and a box set. Extras on the two disc edition are a real disappointment,  with only a modest documentary and some junket material. There?s not even a collector?s booklet included. Also, the hard cover packaging is awkward to store. The deluxe edition contains considerably more in the way of extra features and comes in a handsome box. It is also three times the money of the two disc edition.	4.0	NOT A PERFECT TRANSFER - STILL A PERFECT FILM!	2004-03-06	10	5	5

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2XOR94CWWQ4G1	Noel	This movie really does strike various emotional chords within me when I see it. I have seen it once before, about ten years ago, and now being older, more mature, having worked for someone who is Jewish for four years now, and just having more connections overall it's a very hard film to watch. However, the absolute amazing work of Steven Spielberg cannot be denied when it comes to this movie. For the most part, this movie documents the process of the holocaust, and a man named Oskar Schindler who was trying to save lives of those who were being persecuted per their culture without reason, and make a living at the same time. He was a kind hearted man who was for the most part trying to help others, and trying to keep himself out of the horrific spot light of the Germans. The movie documents the various concentration camps that the Jews were forced to live in, as well as the murdering of nearly 600 million Jews over the course of several years. Schindler is basically ensuring those around him who are working in his plant that they would survive and get through this horrific experience that would kill so many in the end. This movie is important to the Jewish faith because I feel that it truly does allow for those who share this faith even more so bond together in a society of people who will never allow their faith to be harmed, even in circumstances like the Holocaust. The movie truly does allow for one to think that even in the most evil of circumstances, and with the most evil of people such as the  Nazi leaders that the Jewish faith stands, and that it cannot be murdered itself.	5.0	Amazing film	2010-11-21	2	1	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A14SOHUCCL0606	Nowhere Man	"In ""Schindler's List"", Steven Speilberg surpassed even his formidable powers to create a moving, yet largely clear-eyed visualization of the Holocaust. Step-by distressing step Speilberg carefully portrays the Nazi's gradual destruction of the European Jews: from discrimination to ghettoization to incarceration and extermination.  And yet, the film is such a fully realized work, from its pacing, character development to the elegant black-and-white photography, that it is also, paradoxically, embracing - Speilberg shows you what a great director at the top of his powers can do with the film medium.  When I first saw it in 1993, I was both horrified and saddened by the content of the film but, also, in awe, thrilled even, that Speilberg had the courage to realize this brilliant historical recreation.  Rarely has a film been so evocative of an historical period different than the one in which it is made.Looking at the film now, I appreciate its subtlities better.  After an additional ten years of filmgoing, the violence in ""Schindler's List"" doesn't seem quite so overwhelming (its portrayal of human degradation does, however); in fact, Speilberg actually exercises admirable restraint throughout - he doesn't over-emphasize the cruelty of the Nazis to hammer home his points.  Liam Neeson's performance seems less wooden, now, and fuller; he makes wonderful use of his physique throughout and his transformation from war profiteer to hero doesn't seem as one-dimensional now as once it did.  Finally, for the things that Speilberg got wrong, like Neeson's final scene, crying that he could've saved ""one more person"" (one would think that, by that point in the film, Schinder's essential goodness wouldn't have to be emphasized), it's amazing how much Speilberg got right: all the little historical details and observations of family life.  The Jews themselves, who were criticized as being an indistinct mass of victims in this film, have actually come into greater focus and we see now how skillfully Speilberg has intervowen the histories of a good half-dozen families within his larger narrative.It's a great film but a less-than-desirable DVD.  I second all the ""whining"" about the double-sided disc - mine came in scratched too - and lack of extras.  I appreciated the documentary from the Shoah Foundation, but it would have been nice to have seen more the Schindler Jews who were prominent in the film. Also: Speilberg mentioned in interviews when the film was first released that he had an initial 4.5-hour cut of the film, I was really hoping that he would've restored this footage and brought out a ""director's cut"" edition rather than a gift-pack edition that is essentially all marketing paraphenilia wrapped around the same standard DVD."	5.0	Brilliant film, lackluster DVD	2004-03-22	0	0	0

I do agree that having the movie in two parts suck but for that I blame the public, not the movie company.  If people weren't so overhyped about DTS, there would be no useless DTS soundtrack on the disc, leaving enough space to fit a three hour movie in there.  Even George Lucas does not believe in DTS and for that, I applaud him.  Dolby Digital works for me, especially since it is backwards compatible and can be downmixed to normal stereo.PS. My Canadian release had a security sticker stuck to the inside of the fold out case, beneath the disc tray.

Is that all you people can come up with to judge one of the most coveted releases on the DVD format?Let's talk about the technical merits of the DVD presentation. The video and sound quality are superb; this is certainly the finest treatment this film has ever received and for the price of what Amazon is offering, the Collector's Gift Set cannot be beat. Because this film was so late in getting released, no doubt it has had the benefit of better restorative methods to preserve and enhance the original print. If anything, we should also thank the studios for releasing this film with the Collector's Edition the same time as the standard widescreen release, instead of trying to force the consumers to double-dip on two different versions.The price of this set at Amazon clearly beats any B&M; store in the country. I haven't seen a single person criticize the video and sound quality, the CD soundtrack, the book or limited senitype, and if you are a true collector only that should matter. The plexiglass case is prone to cracking (most likely due to being dropped during shipping), but is clearly a defining piece to your DVD shelf.Regardless of what you think of this film, this is one of the finest (and cost-friendly) Collector Edition sets ever released, period.	5.0	Excellent DVD treatment of one of the finest films ever made	2004-04-22	3	2	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1QMBDCF3FSJI6	Orna Shearin	The movie Schindler&#8217;s List is based upon the book Schindler&#8217;s Ark written by Thomas Keneally.  The movie is about a man named Oskar Schindler, who was German.  The story is about the Polish Jews who were moved to the Krakow Ghetto at the beginning of World War II.  The movie begins with Schindler trying to convince the Jews to come and work at his factory.  He offers to pay them in goods rather than in money.  He says it is because money would not be good in the ghetto anyway, but truly it is for selfish purposes, to line his pockets.  As time progress he labels all of his employees critical, so that they cannot be taken to the camps and executed, again not to save lives but to continue to make money.  As time goes on his factory becomes known as a haven for Jews and more and more people request to come and work for him.  Eventually he has a change of heart and realizes that he has become a savior for many people.  As the Germans begin to lose the war the remaining Jews are slated to be shipped to Auschwitz.  After forking over a tremendous bribe Schindler convinces Geoth to allow him to take his remaining workers and move them to a munitions factory he has in his hometown.  Thus, &#8221;Schindler&#8217;s List&#8221; is born, this list comprises all the people that will be shipped to the munitions factory as opposed to the concentration camp.  In the process of this happening the men and woman are shipped on different trains and the women&#8217;s train is rerouted to Auschwitz, at which point Schindler has to buy the women again.  At the new factory he allows, even encourages his workers to celebrate the Shabbat as well as other Jewish traditions.  He forbids SS workers into the factory and spends much of his personal wealth to keep these Jews safe.  As the movie ends so does World War II, the Nazis have surrendered and a soldier comes and tells the Jews they have been freed.  As they walk to a nearby town the movie rather glosses over Schindler later in life as well as Geoth&#8217;s execution as war criminal.  At the very end of the movie you see the real Jews of the encampment, along with the actors who portrayed them at Oskar Schindler&#8217;s grave.  This scene was heart rending and heartwarming at the same time.In relation to World religions, this movie focuses on Judaism.  One of the main symbols that I saw was the Shabbat candles.  The candles at the beginning of the movie as the family is celebrating the Shabbat fade into smoke as the movie starts to show the true ordeal of the Jews and the candles return once more at the end as they start celebrating the Shabbat once again the safety of the factory.  This movie also really shows how God&#8217;s commandments of love thy brother as thy self and do unto to others as you would have done unto you really are so true.  It would have been very easy for Schindler to never have looked back and allowed his workers to be taken into the camps.  They would have been easy to replace, yet his conscience gets the better of him and he becomes respected not only in the Jewish world but in the secular world as well.	5.0	Schindler's List	2014-03-21	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AV57G4XYDZUSM	Pablo A Diaz	Well, truthfuly I don't know a great deal about holocaust movies, the only movies with this subject I've ever watched are this one and &quot;Life is beautiful&quot; so they are to opposites you might say, but still I found  this film to be very moving, It's a very valid recreation about the days in  the holocaust, hey, it won the Oscar for best adaptation and many scenes  were borrowed from the tellings of holocaust surviviors, pretty pathetic  (look at the dictionary for the true meaning of this word) the scenes of  Auschwitz with that eirie music, but many people would find this one very  depressing and I do agree with them, I liked the evil nazi figure played by  Ralph Fiennes, and the woman-enchanting personality seen of Oscar  Schindler. I would like to buy this film, but only if it's released on DVD,  it's more practical.	5.0	Pretty well achieved Spielberg's objective	2000-03-06	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1H4593RT0V9AS	Paul Davey	I rented Schindler's List because I wanted to see it again.  This film could easily qualify as a period piece, drama, history, documentary, romance, and action movie.  It is great literature, set to celluloid.  I grew up at a time when it was trendy for people to say that their favorite films were 'City Lights' or 'The Gold Rush' or 'Citizen Kane,' as if the truly great films were dusty and remote in time.  If that is true, it suggests that film is stagnant, that it has no evolutionary or growth potential, and that it never gets better.  As a viewer, observer and student of humanity, it is hard not to appreciate the story of redemption that is captured by 'Schindler's List,' or the one spot of color that appears, for a short passage, in an otherwise black-and-white world, the color seen moving and alive, then buried and dead, or the good that arises from evil, like the Phoenix from the ashes, or the ashes themselves, that fall like snowflakes, feigning purity. It is a story of God, in the fallen, of grace, in the common man, of triumph in the midst of doom and of compassion in the face of corruption and decay.  It is flawless, the best film ever made.	5.0	Schindler's List	2013-08-13	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3JVEZEL9C2DM5	"Paul Stevenson ""Linguist"""	The emotions aroused by this movie are varied. One feels loathing for the evil Nazis who treat Jews like animals for the slaughter; admiration for the courage of Oskar Schindler and the few who help him rescue over 1,000 Jews; and a bit of wonder that a man who was obviously no saint (he was  a womanizer, materialist and member of the Nazi party) would risk his life and fortune to help those who would otherwise be sent to the slaughter. It goes to show that goodness is to be found in the hearts of all kinds of people, not just those of great religious faith and virtue.Perhaps the most moving part of this film is the very end, where we see many of the Jews who are alive today (i.e., at the time the movie was made) walking by Schindler's grave in Israel and dropping flowers on it. I was overwhelmed thinking that none of those people would have been there if Schindler hadn't put his neck on the line for them. It brought tears to my eyes to see them paying their respects to the man who made it possible for them to be there.A follow-up book titledSchindler's Legacy: True Stories of the List Survivorswas published in 1994. It tells us about the lives of a number of the people who were saved thanks to Schindler. Some went on to become pillars of society, others to lead rather ordinary lives, and some to lead somewhat messy lives. But you know what the most important thing is? THEY GOT TO LIVE THEIR LIVES! Just like the rest of us, they had a chance to get on with the business of living. Just like the rest of us, some did better than others; some made good choices and some made poor choices. But the important thing is that they had the opportunity. Their lives were not snuffed out in some Nazi death camp. Oskar Schindler gave them the chance to do like the rest of us are doing: just living. That, my friends, was something worth doing!	5.0	Heartbreaking, uplifting	2009-02-20	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AL8IWEXRY1EWB	"P. Connors ""Colonialpara"""	This is Steven Spielberg's tribute to the victims of the Holocaust.  Filmed with stunning precision, in Black and White to stress the stark bleakness of the situation faced by the Jews in Nazi occupied Poland, this is also the story of one man's attempt to bring humanity to a totally inhumane situation.Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, a German war profiteer who comes to Poland with next to nothing but a plan to fleece the Third Reich and leave with &quot;steamer trunks&quot; full of cash.  He takes advantage of the forced relocation of Polish Jews to the ghetto in Cracow and establishes, through somewhat shady means, the Deutsche Emailwaren Fabrik, where he manufactures enamel ware for the Wehrmacht.  In the process of starting his business, he enlists the aid of Ben Kingsley (Itzak Stern) the former chief accountant of the company.  Schindler then proceeds with his program, but he needs workers.Schindler, a master of the con, convinces several influential officers in the Allegmeine SS that hisplan can be mutually beneficial for all.  The Jews in the ghetto will be the workers (slaves) and Schindler will &quot;take care&quot; of his Nazi partners.  One of the most despicable is SS Untersturmfuhrer (later Hauptsturmfuhrer) Amon Goeth, played with chilling accuracy by Ralph Fiennes.  While partnering with Schindler, Goeth amuses himself by randomly sniping into the camp from the veranda of his house (which overlooks the camp's perimeter).  He also involves himself in many of the construction details and there is a frightening look at his character when he arbitrarily executes a female Jewish civil engineer simply because she points out that the foundation for a barracks was poured wrong.  He orders one of his sergeants to shoot her and then, takes her advice anyway.  He turns to his staff and says, &quot;we will not argue with these people...&quot;Arbeitslager Plazsow was not a death camp in the same way that Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen or Sobibor or Treblinka or any of the others were.  It was a holding facility for the slave laborers who made Schindler andother Nazis wealthy as they provided goods and services for the Third Reich.  Needless to say, Goeth's psychopathic behavior, along with the  murderous policy edicts from Berlin ensured that many in the camp did die from unnatural causes.Spielberg uses the interactions between Schindler and the SS and Schindler and his Jews to deliver the emotional punch in this movie.  As the movie reels out, the viewer sees the subtle transformation in Schindler, as he tries to do the right thing and save as many lives as possible.  He even intercedes with Amon Goeth and tries to moderate his homicidal impulses when he explains the true nature of the power the Germans have over the Jews.  There is an interesting conversation after a party, where Schindler tries to teach Goeth about pardons.  After that scene, there are almost humorous scenes immediately after, where Goeth stalks through the camp &quot;pardoning&quot; inmates for offenses that would normally draw a bullet to the back of the head.Throughout the film, John Williams soaring score is intertwined with Jewish religious music used to reinforce religious and cultural ceremonies.  This is an outstanding film and it provides an eye-opening look at the heroism of Schindler and the people he sought to protect and deliver from the Nazis.  To be sure, this is not a pleasant or happy movie.  The ending was just another beginning, for the survivors were now refugees and the Nazis had deprived them of everything.  They had to start over again and find new homes.If you never see another movie on the depredations of the Nazi era, you must see SCHINDLER'S LIST.  As the movie closes, Spielberg streams the real characters of the story (accompanied by the actors who played them on film).  Oskar Schindler is buried in Israel and is considered a &quot;rightheous person&quot; by the Committee of the Yad Vashem.  This movie, which is a celebration of life, is also a tribute to him, and others like him, who did NOT follow in lock-step or look away as the Nazi's butchered six million people.As this movie serves to remind all who see it of man's inhumanity to his fellow man, it is also a loud message that this type of inhumanity must never be allowed to happen again.	5.0	Never Again!	2001-03-31	3	2	1

I mean, Sophie's Choice nearly did me in. But I was wrong. While there's plenty of horror and violence in Schindler's List, the movie is really a character study of one man's transformation. Schindler, for reasons probably inexplicable even to himself, rose above his privileged, hedonistic, self-serving lifestyle to become a hero from within the system.Oskar Schindler risked his life and bankrupted himself but managed to save more than 1000 Jews from death in the Polish and German concentration camps. He employed them in his factory and convinced the German Army that their services were essential to the war effort - while at the same time making certain that no product that emerged from his factory would function properly.Schindler, a womanizer, hard drinker, and relentless party-goer prior to his epiphany, was able to use his social skills, his arts of deception, his diplomacy and glib tongue to make his vow to save Jewish lives become a reality.If you haven't seen this film for reasons of squeamishness, get over it.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A10ZOLF5VFTFF4	Perry's reviews	The year is 1939 and the United States has yet to enter World War II.  Oskar Schindler, a German war profiteer arrives on scene in Germany hoping to make a small fortune .  Working with the SS military officials, Schindler is running a factory building mess kits. When he first opens the factory, he enjoys considerable profits as he hires Jewish Poles instead of Catholics because they were cheaper labor, and what began as a for profit operation begins to be more about keeping as many Jews out of the concentration camps as possible.  Throughout the movie, Schindler and his collaborator Itzhak Stern focus on bribing Nazi officials to keep support at high levels while keeping as many Jews from going to concentration camps. As Schindler gets ready to leave Krakow with his substantial profits, he feels great guilt and sorrow and persuades Goeth to let him take all of his workers to a factory in his old home away from death in the camps. The bribes are extremely high however, his list takes many workers with him, saving them from death. As the war comes to an end, Russian Troops draw nearer and Schindler must flee because he is considered a Nazi Party member. At this point he is given a ring that has Talmudic words to hopefully save his life. In the end, Schindler is out of money and has risked his life to save as many Jews as possible.Overall, this movie is a sad story of human nature and the way history repeats itself.  When tyrannical government takes over nations, it causes ordinary individuals to do horrible things they would not ordinarily do. The actors in this film perform civic duty to inform the world of the horror that took place in Nazi Germany during World War II. The cast members and supporting cast did an excellent job portraying the real life people who were saved by Schindler and Stern. World Religions were shaken by this event as more innocent people were killed due to ethnicity and religious affiliation than any other single event in the 20th century. This event therefore put other religious groups on alert; this could happen to them! This film depicts events of the Holocaust that vastly shaped Judaism and created ultimate sympathy for a group of people once oppressed for centuries.  One would think that after such a horrible event the world would never accept such ethnic cleansing as happened during this time period, yet ethnic cleansing continues in Africa more regularly than any news organization would like to admit. Nevertheless, Schindler's list is the canary in the coal mine that will forever immortalize the millions of innocent lives lost and forever serve as a warning of such a horrific tragedy to never happen again. Hitler, and the holocaust are the keynote warning signs to any religious nation now and in the future, let this never, ever happen again.	5.0	Perry's reviews	2013-03-20	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A11FX8HL2ANK6T	Peter Suslock	It was both painful and great to see this remarkable film once again. In a recent interview Steven Speiberg explains that to present what the Holocaust was really like would be impossible. No one but a survivor could possibly understand.I was fascinated by his explanation of using metaphors in imagery to express larger issues, as an example he talked about the little girl with the red coat who we see twice and in the second shot being lead away to her death in the gas chamber. The use of red was the only color in the black and white film and goes unnoticed  and ignored.His comparison of this sequence of images was to show how the world, especially the United States being well aware of the atrocities did nothing. It was a striking point.To see the Holocaust through the eyes of a Nazi party member, played with amazing complexity by Liam Neeson is brilliant, especially as we see him change from an opportunist whose sole ambition is to  make money off of slave labor to one of the great humanitarians who risked everything to save the lives of those doomed by a regime of unprecedented evil.It's a fearless tour de force performance.Seeing the film again, the performances are impeccable, Ralph Fiennes is horrifying as the notorious, living personification of sadism Amon Goeth. In turn Ben Kingsley is heart wrenching and spectacular as Itzhak Stern, Shindlers accountant and later Ali is perhaps his finest hour on film.Shindlers List is a remarkable and dreadful to bare look into the largest and most horrific mass murder in history. In the light of the recent discovery of over 400 additional death camps Shindler's List has never been more relevant.I'm pleased to see the rating reduced to PG-13 - for to bare witness is to remember. To not remember the past means we're doomed to repeat it. A must see film by one of the most prolific and visionary directors the world has ever known.	5.0	One Of The Most Significant Films Of All Time	2013-03-12	2	1	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP	Phil Berardelli	Steven Spielberg finally won Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, after 19 years of trying, with this powerful portrait of one of the most heroic figures of the Holocaust. Based on the historical novel by Thomas Keneally, it's the story of Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who protected and eventually saved hundreds of Jews from the death camps by insisting they were essential for his factory and by bribing Nazi officials into complicity. Shot in black and white except for one symbolic scene, the movie contains moments of extreme emotional intensity. Spielberg's technical crew advanced the ability to portray murder and execution on the screen with horrifying results, and Ralph Fiennes (pronounced RAFE FINE) made his movie debut as the sadistic concentration camp commandant. It is a vivid, grim portrait of humanity at its worst, yet with a quietly shattering but triumphant resolution. The John Williams score, with a violin solo by virtuoso Itzhak Perlman, is possibly the most exquisitely sad bit of movie music ever written.Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)	5.0	Spielberg's vivid, grim portrait of humanity at its worst	2013-09-06	0	0	0

It gives the viewer an intense feeling of how terrible life was for people during that time in the concentration camps. It should make each of us stop to think about the atrocities of war and how horribly people suffer at the hands of bigoted people. Hopefully civilized people (and uncivilized ones) can learn an important lesson about discrimination against anyone just because their beliefs are different and also to show love and respect to others.

They, through the whole story, were fully clothed and clean, not one was under weight. I guess I feel that glossing over the reality of this tragedy is only going to make some willing to see it happen again.

The characters were believable, the cinematography was great, and everything fit together well. I was upset with only one thing though. In the movie, the Jews were quicker to forgive the Germans than they were to forgive the Poles. My opinion may be a little skewed, but its true. While the Poles sat defeated, and were unable to help the Jews in any way, the Germans were shooting them left and right. But when the war is over, the Jews are best friends with the Germans, but hate the Polish for not helping them. Had they realized that the Polish had been DEFEATED, they would know that there was no way they could have legally helped. Many Poles, my family included, hid the Jews from the Germans during World War II, but all that is forgotten. Because so many Jews were killed in Poland, lets all assume its the fault of the Poles. Anyway, I still gave this film four stars. Other than that one problem I had with it, I thought it was alright.	4.0	Pretty good film.	2003-07-10	5	2	3

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1K6K23WG0IBWE	Quadro Sinead Summer	"Schindler's List is without a doubt an exceptional masterpiece. But more than that it is a very realistic, powerful, and dramatic rendering of the most significant event in the history or mankind. Telling the story of German Industrialist Oskar Schindler as the main subject of the story makes the film a monument to this man and his incredible story. Schindler was just an ordinary German who exploited the war for his own gain. He raised an empire with money that wasn't his, and prospered to make ""More money than anyone could spend in a lifetime"". Over time he see's the horror and cruelty that is inflicted on the Jews and realizes that what he has prospered from is stained with the blood of millions of people. He transforms into a man who fights to save them. He spends every cent he has earned to buy the Jews from Nazi concentration camps to work in his factory making artilary shells that can't even be fired. This incredible true story is grim, freightening, extremely violent, brutal and heartbreaking. It is also an incredible story of a touching transformation of one man who saved the lives of hundreds of Jews. Schindler's list is one of the most powerful films you are likely to ever see and the winner of 7 Oscars, including best Picture (1993). It is filled with horrifying images of brutality, Sex, graphic nudity, and harsh language, so be aware of this where small children or sensitive types are concerned. For all others this film should be considered required viewing. Simply as powerful as motion pictures can ever get."	5.0	On my top 50 greatest films of all time list!	2013-05-10	7	6	1

I wasn't any happier about it, but all I had to do was get off my lazy butt and change the side. That aside, I just finished watching the movie and I thought it was pretty good. I don't know how acurate it was, but Oskar Schindler was a good man. He was the only one who seemed to care enough about the Jewish people to try to save them. Yeah, he made them work for very little wages in his factory, but it was better than being shot in the back of the head. I wouldn't consider buying this movie, but I would suggest renting it.	3.0	It was alright	2005-04-09	6	0	6

Steven Speilsberg has done such a great job directing this movie. This movie is worth 5 stars, and it is emotinally for other people. But the journey is  incredible.  And the movie has a happy ending.  I say it's the best movie  of 1993.  7 Oscars to this movie will refer people that it's remarkable!	5.0	I COULD NEVER GET ENOUGH OF THIS MOVIE!	1999-06-23	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3PWPNZVMNX3PA	rareoopdvds	I was very excited to see the DVD of Schindler's List finally released. So excited, in fact, that I bought the Collector's Edition. To my dismay, it was not a very exciting collection.Before I get to that, I will just state that the movie is as good as ever and it has been some time since I have seen it. The quality is clean and clear, while sound is great. This is a film that utilizes the widescreen aspect and should be seen in this format (why they even offer a full screen is beyond my comprehension). Nonetheless, it is an amazing film; certainly Spielberg's finest to date.The collection that comes with the DVD does not quite meet the films quality. What you will receive in the set is a picture disc of the soundtrack. The soundtrack is from John Williams, and perhaps one of his most moving scores I have heard from him. While he instills his usual thematic sound, the music in this film has a deeply personal emotion that is carried with it, along with Itzhak Perlman's violin solos. Truly beautiful music, however sad it may sound.Along with the soundtrack is a senitype, which is a reproduction of one of the 35mm frames. I imagine they are the same pictures, one of the girl in the red coat walking along the streets. Its a nice photo, but why do I want it? What am I going to do with it?Also is a small hardcover book of images from the film. A nice book as well, but with a book that shows photos of the movie, why  look at the book when you can just watch the movie? Very little in the making of the film.Finally is a Certificate of Authenticity. Now this just tops the cake. I mean, a Certificate that says this is a real AND official collector's set, because if I did not get one of these, I was going to assume this was a bootleg of some sort. There is not even a printed autograph! It just brags about the film and tells you what the set offers, which, if you did not open the set to see what was in it, you could not read this little certificate to see what was in it. Completely stupid.If that does not thrill you enough, then you will also get a little pamphlet that tells you about the SHOAH organization which you can send some money to support them. Ugh.The DVD offers some extras. No commentary, no behind the scenes footage. Can't break that fourth wall, now!! Keep it real! But you will get stories of the real Schindler Jews who have survived. You will also learn about the SHOAH organization. Furthermore is a video on Schindler's life, which is probably the best extra on the disc. The DVD is two-sided which is another unfortunate aspect which takes me back to the laser-disc days when I had to flip the disc over to continue the film. That annoyws me that I have to do that.The best part of the collection is the case, which is a plexiglass casing with the names of the list printed in gray. Its pretty cool. While all this stuff is held in a slip case, which does not hold it very well, the plexiglass case has some metal dowels to keep it all in place.In all, a poor set and for the price, definately not worth it. If I had known it was going to be a disappointing set, I would have just saved my money and bought the movie only version.The ratings are 5 stars for the movie, and 2 stars for the set, which culminates to about 3 stars overall. If you love the movie, get the movie, not this set.	3.0	Great Movie - Disappointing Set	2004-03-27	52	42	10

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3Q2Q5ZV2JQNM5	Ray H	Steven Spielberg's &#34;Schindler's List&#34; is not just an important historical piece, it's a wholly satisfying movie, and dare I say it, an entertaining one in its own right. Contrary to possible preconceptions, it's not a depressing slog of a movie. Much of the movie is gripping and taut with suspense. More importantly, there are genuine depictions of humanity and strength on display. Even moments of humor make their way into the film. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley head up a terrific cast, bringing life and charisma to their portrayals. At times, the movie may get a little melodramatic, but Steven Zaillian has crafted a great screenplay and Spielberg knows when big emotional flourishes are warranted. Everything from the cinematography, costumes, music, production design, and more are uniformly excellent.The film has been newly remastered for this Blu-ray and it looks terrific. The transfer is natural, film-like, and features great sharpness, detail, and shadow depth. The Blu-ray really showcases Janusz Kaminski's masterful black and white photography. The audio is equally excellent and does a great job presenting the film's sound design and John Williams' music.The biggest disappointment from this Blu-ray is the film's supplements. I guess Spielberg wants to treat this film as a historical document, and likewise the only extras are testimonies from Holocaust survivors and a brief piece about the Shoah Foundation (both the DVD #2 found in this set). While I understand the decision, I feel the movie also deserves to have its own story told. Why did Spielberg choose to make this film? How was it developed? How did the cast approach their roles? None of these topics are discussed on this Blu-ray. The only real document of the film's production we have is Franciszek Palowski's book &#34;The Making of Schindler's List: Behind the Scenes of an Epic Film&#34;.	5.0	Steven Spielberg's masterpiece gets a terrific 20th Anniversary Blu-ray	2013-04-20	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ACNTD3LADI0OQ	Raymond D. Grosser	This very true story of Oskar Schindler is compelling and necessary to remind many of what happens when government chooses to eliminate those they do not believe that all men are endowed by the creator, with certain unalienable rights.This is a very tough film to watch, but it should be required watching for those in our day who think that National Socialism is a better way of life than a free man.  The agony of the truth behind this film, and the history of the Schindler Jews who eventually went back to Palastine to carve out a national Israel is compelling.  The horrible truth is that the remnant of Jews who did carve out National Israel are doing so with enemies all around and yet reveal that a hand greater than the politicians and historians is at work even in our day.A revelation to modern man that Yahweh does indeed intervene into the lives of the children of men.

Schindler's List was masterfully directed by Steven Spielberg (all his movies following this one are average at best, to put it mildly!).  Schindler's List was directed with METICULOUS detail and acted superbly.  Cinematographer Kaminsky's black and white photography is some of the finest I have ever seen (up there with Fellini's La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2--which I consider to be some of the most gorgeous B&W movies ever!).  While difficult to watch at times (heart-rending and disturbing), the simple story of a compassionate man (Oskar Schindler), saving a discriminated people from Nazi persecution, is a stark reminder of how we must NEVER repeat the past and why we must continue to push forward for a more civilized society.	5.0	A Master Work!	2013-04-09	0	0	0

However, good film-making is not so much the assertion of a truth as it is the making of that truth more evident to us. I failed  to see the humanity of Schindler because Spielberg just doesn't know how to  portray characters well. He is good at canvas but not depth (eg saving p.  r.) Watch The Rules of the GAme (1939) or Come and See (1985)- which has  very similar subject matter- as well. This film should be viewed, but it is  not surprising that it is one of the best films of the 90's considering  that the 90's are cinematography's worst decade. Good- but not a  masterpiece. Spielberg is just too Jewish to make a film about the  holocaust. Someone more detached could probably make the Holocaust more  relevant on film because an outsider would present the humanity of both  sides- and thus show that any human is capable of atrocities.	4.0	Good- not great!	1999-11-12	16	5	11

Seeing him break down at the notion that he could have saved more (Jews) with the ring on his finger or the car he's chauffered away in...The black and white with a hint of color really empowers this film to deliver excellent drama and you can't help but become attached to the characters of the film.Definitely in my top 5 films of all time.	5.0	An Inspiring Piece of Film	2006-05-09	1	1	0

My wife is much more the fan of comedy movies, so she sat through this silently, gripping my hand tightly at times. Early on, she asked, ""Why are they doing this?"" I explained as best I could. Later, she fell mostly silent, only commenting again when she realized that Schindler was trying to save his factory workers.It's a sad, moving testament to humanity, this film.

However: The fact that one man, a quite average guy, stood up and did so much for the Jewish people is encouraging.  Germans should take heart that in a time when their country seemingly went nuts, there were some with the courage and decency to take the risk and save people.  Acting was excellent.  Neeson, Fiennes and Kingsley were as real as could be.  You had to admire Schindler, Hate Goth and love Stern.  The rest of the cast, right to the extras, was great too.

We saw mounds of glasses, gold tooth fillings, shoes. Prisoners dug mass graves they'd probably be buried in and smokestacks burned black above the concentration camps, all in stark black and white. I'll never forget those films.I haven't seen ""Schindler's List"" until now and that was because I was told this was one of the 'must see' films of the 20th century. I'd agree with that assessment.The essential story is that of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman and war profiteer who originally saw World War II as an opportunity and the Jews as a likely source of funding for his crockery factory.  As the movie progresses, Schindler's character changes. He's one of the most fascinating and unlikely heroes you'll ever encounter.What strikes me is the similarity between those newsreels and ""Schindler."" Steven Spielberg kept it real and the impact is just as jarring.This is a movie you should see if you pride yourself in being a cinema buff.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3GS6CBFFLRTF4	rlcb	Liam Neeson's heart felt portrayal of Oskar Schindler in Steven Spielberg's film Schindler's List helped earn Steven Spielberg's true story seven Oscars including, Best Picture. The movie Schindler's List is a 1997docudrama about Oskar Schindler, a womanizing alcoholic business man from Czechoslovakia. Schindler took over an apartment in Krakow, Poland that had been originally occupied by a Jewish family who had been sent to the Ghetto, with the hopes of being a more successful business man than his father.  Upon his arrival in Krakow he quickly got in with the local Gestapo Chiefs. It was partially due to the influence he had with these men which eventually enabled him to save the lives of over a thousand Jews during Hitler's reign in Germany. As it turns out his factory, Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik, was not just in the business of making money, pot and pans, or ammunition, but it turned out to be in the business of saving lives.The film is in the true documentary form of black and white. Spielberg puts a slight twist on the motion picture by beginning it with a modern day Jewish family celebration, in color, as the family disappears so does the color. The last scene in the film fades back to color from black and white. This is an especially powerful scene of the surviving Jews, Schindler's Jews, coming to his grave to honor him. The holocaust's impact on the Jewish community is immeasurable but it is evident in the last scene that Oskar Schindler's impact on the Jews was to leave hope in humanity.Although Oskar Schindler does not appear to be very religious himself there are several indications that he is sympathetic to the plight of the Jewish people such as when he reminds a factory worker, the Rabbi, that it is Friday night close to sunset, that Sabbath is about to begin. Mr. Schindler may not have been a military hero but he became a hero of the Jewish people because of his bravery and willingness to risk his business and his life to save them. In the end Oskar Schindler gave up his earthly treasures to save persecuted people.Schindler's List	5.0	Review for Schindler's List	2013-04-11	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AP7U64LVKR9VI	R. Lowe	Shindler's List is not for the faint of heart yet it is a movie everyone should see.  Whether Mr. Speilburg makes a commentary on his work or not doesn't make any difference to me.  What he has done is tell a story of one man who although a scoundrel in his ways, was a man who was not afraid of his inner heart.  A man who with the world around him standing by watching people being murdered, people being shipped off to be murdered, was brave enough to do all he possibly could to save human lives.  A real hero, if I may say.  The film is graphic certainly but it is truthfully graphic...the way it should be.  Openly honest.  Sadly there are still people who claim the Holocaust never happened.  How or why they can say that is beyond me.  Millions died...because they were Jewish...or Russian...or Polish...or Gypsies...of French....or Dutch....or Hungarian....yet non beleivers still say it never happened.  I see a little child in a red coat walking along among the crowds being forced to their deaths and know it happened...over and over again.  This movie is a masterpiece of epic proportions!

What really stands out in my mind, is the little girl wearing the red coat in an all black-and-white film. Her fate is followed to the end. A very sad end. Nothing from Spieleberg, or any other director had ever been portrayed with such powerful effect. No other film even comes close to the horrors portrayed with such realism. Liam Neeson seems ten feet tall in the role of Oskar Schindler. How freely man is willing to unload his deadly weapons upon a fellow human being, when blinded by prejudice.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A32MLGE3YOVWW7	Robbie Lewis	Brilliant, provocative, gut-wrenchingly moving, this film could do to cinematography what Shakespeare did to the English language - shake it, define it, refine it.  How Spielberg's classic could not have been one of  Time magazine's films of the century is beyond me.  Forget Spielberg the  man, focus on the film. Yep, black and white has been done before but never  has it been done on such a tapestry, not just as a medium but as a method  for conveying meaning.  Remember the little girl in the pink dress,  Keneally's &quot;meandering full stop&quot; at the end of the column of  Jews.  Doubters be damned!  How could anyone not be moved to their core  when the little pink dress is revealed at its final tragic destination?  Forget not that that first the book, then the film, then Spielberg's  Survivors of the Shoah project have added nobility to a fetid sore.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	Schindler's List(released Dec/93)was deservedly the big winner of the /93-/94 OSCAR race with seven statuettes awarded.It boasts a powerhouse cast with the likes of Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler,Ben Kingsley as his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern,Ralph Fiennes as the sadistic camp commandant Amon Goeth,and many ,many more.The film was shot in b&w; for effect,which beautifully served to heighten the intensity and emotion this movie produced.The story is of course based on facts,hard to believe facts in this day and age,but nonetheless they stand as testimony to the brutality(and corruption)of the German WW2 war machine.From the script to the acting to the film's entire execution(no pun intended)on film,it is flawless.Schindler in reality was no saint and in fact a womanizer(he was married during this period),a drunk and a poor businessman.But what in the beginning began as an attempt at selfish monetary gains through bribery and pressure,turned into an honest attempt to save as many Jews as he could in his factories,at an unbelievable personal risk.By the time the film comes to its inevitable conclusion you will,guaranteed,have shed a few tears during some of the many very touching moments.Technically the film is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and the picture is crisp and clear.This edition I review is the newest incarnation which celebrates Universal's 100th anniversary.As such there is an outer cover which opens at the front,which the regular DVD case just slips into.This edition is also,unfortunately,a one disc version.This is the only criticism of this DVD,that for a 100th anniversary release,Universal would choose to cheaply put this film onto a double sided DVD;prone to all the scratching and scuff marks one could ask for.This film,along with any other so called anniversary release,deserves much better.Extras include the usual from previous releases of this DVD such as the Shoah Foundation and Voices from the List featurettes,along with some true facts on Schindler himself.In conclusion I can't say I approve of the manner in which this DVD has been released,but it is the film that is most important,and for that it gets all five stars;it's worth more.This is a film EVERY person in the world should be shown,and most importantly children and history students.This film is just one of the countless reasons that we should NEVER,EVER forget that period,that terrible period in our collective history.Highly recommended.	5.0	An engrossing film about a light in the darkness!	2012-02-26	3	2	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ	Robert Blake	Steven Spielberg's &quot;Schindler's List&quot; remains one of the greatest of all movies, and one of the most effective. This is an example of incredibly powerful cinema. The movie is rich in everything from design  to casting and especially cinematography. It's fitting the Spielberg films  the movie in black and white, because it makes some statement of the era  and reflects the darkness of it. Never have the horrors of the Holocaust  been shown so realistically and convincingly on screen. Spielberg shows the  perverse nature and evil of the Nazis in all their realism.  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is unforgettable and moves the viewer to  tears. There are tears of sadness, rage, happiness and admiration. Liam  Neeson gives a fantastic performance that never lacks power. This is what  dramatic filmmaking is all about. &quot;Schindler's List&quot; will never  lose it's power and will endure for many years to come.	5.0	One Of The Most Powerful Of All Films.	2000-05-04	1	0	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2B9BPC5XIJCQT	Robert Frank	Although I thought it was a good movie, it doesn't belong on the AFI top 100 list. And if it does, certaintly not at #9!! Spielburg probably can't believe it either. The movie was about 1 hour too long and the end was destroyed by the 20 minute wishy-washy Schindler speech about himself. The AFI has to consider many things so I understand why they would include this in their list, it's the first big budget &quot;holocaust victim&quot; movie. But that doesn't mean we automatically should include it with the top 100. Right? No? So you think I'm a racist? If you think that then you probably liked this movie and like it even more now. Go ahead, stick it on top of Citizen Kane.Anyway, this film is very emotional so it will appeal to the ladies but not so much to guys. Girls like emotional movies and guys like creative ones. And I don't give mercy points when it comes to lack of creativity so I think it is just an OK movie in the end. Try &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; instead of this. It's the same kind of movie as this but way better.	3.0	Not Worthy!	2001-06-28	31	2	29

Using the subtle but  startling shadings only black and white cinema can produce Steven Speilberg  has created a protean achievement both thought-provoking and shattering in  content and scope. Ralph Fiennes frightening portrayal of the concentration  camp commandant shows the horrifying side of a human both sad and twisted.  Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give performances equally compelling. John  Williams musical score is flawless, evoking an emotional response without  overcoming this disturbing story about a German industrialist who slowly  learns about the Holocaust and tries to save the few Jews he can from  certain death.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"Curious about the etymology of  ""holocaust,"" I again consulted John Ayto's ever-reliable Dictionary of Word Origins and learned that the word has classical origins (as do most other words) and was first used in English by John Milton in reference to ""complete destruction by fire."" Related meanings include ""a complete burning"" (from ""burnt offering"") and ""a sacrifice completely consumed by fire."" In our own time we capitalize the word when referring to the process of systematic elimination by the Third Reich of everyone perceived to be an enemy. Most were Jews but hundreds of thousands of non-Jewish gypsies, clergy, artists, journalists, and political opponents were also among the victims.I am unqualified to comment on this film's authenticity. However, I believe that to the extent possible and appropriate, Spielberg and his screen writers Steven Zaillian and Allan Starski were faithful as well as respectful to the historical material first provided to Thomas Keneally by ""Schindlerjuden"" (""Schindler's Jews""). The film is based on his book, Schindler's Ark (1982), later retitled Schindler's List. In 1993, the film as well as Spielberg and Zaillian and Starski were among the recipients of Academy Awards.The basic situation is that Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a German industrialist in Poland whose company manufactures household items. After the Jews in the Krakow ghetto are transported to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp in 1942, and Schindler's company is required to manufacture munitions for the German war effort, he seizes the opportunity to have Jews work for him as unpaid laborers. He maintains cordial relations with German officers with bribes and lavish entertainment and even enlists Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) as his negotiator to obtain concessions (for a price) from Goeth's superior. The war continues. Over time, for reasons revealed in the film, Schindler develops a benevolent and then paternalistic attitude toward his Jewish workers, all of whose names are carefully recorded on a list compiled by the company's secretary/treasurer, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley). Schindler exhausts his funds trying to protect them from reassignment to concentration camps. Eventually his efforts save approximately 1,100 Jews but by the film's conclusion, he is a bankrupt and broken man. His own life has also become ""a sacrifice completely consumed by fire.""Important films are not necessarily great films. Schindler's List is both. For obvious reasons, it portrays experiences of unique importance to Jews but to a Gentile such as I, it also has much of great value to say about what it means to be a human being worthy of the name. From accounts provided by the ""Schindlerjuden,"" Spielberg and his associates created great cinematic art without even once allowing even the subtlest suggestion of melodrama or sentimentality to compromise the humanity of Oskar Schindler or, more importantly, the integrity of those on his list."	5.0	We Must Add Our Own Stones	2003-07-12	5	4	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AGZVS6M8XJGN6	"Roberto Frangie ""Robert"""	"It's September, 1939.Oskar Schindler is a Nazi-Catholic industrialist from Czechoslovakia, a bon-vivant who realizes that a nice long war in Europe might be an excellent situation for making money... So in a great opening parallel montage, Spielberg depicts the personal journey of one man and the massive journey of one race...As thousand of families are forced to abandon their careers, properties and homes to live in overcrowded ghettos, the scene switches to Schindler, where he pays his way to get a fine table at a fancy nightclub in Nazi-occupied city of Krakow, the surviving gem of Poland's medieval cities...Drinking alone, he scans the strange clientele and slowly sets about casting his nets on the SS German officers... He quickly plied them with food, caviar and French wine... And as a magician, overcoming every resistance, he transforms the separate tables of the cabaret into one joyful drunken party of wine, women, and song for the Nazi officials...The two worlds come together when Schindler meets Itzhak Stern and offers him a deal... Since Jews cannot own businesses, they should work together... Stern's contacts can provide investors, and Stern's expertise can run the business, and Schindler will take care of the presentation...In those same scenes, Amon Goeth is introduced...Goeth is a flabby psychopath who comes to embody the evils of Nazi racism... He is in charge of the camp where the workers are housed and must be bribed and pampered if Schindler is to stay in business... Goeth's excessive cruelty is also part of the reason that Schindler is transformed from an opportunistic 'victimizer' to 'humanitarian.'Liam Neeson portrays Oskar Schindler, the businessman with irresistible charm - the charm of the same magnitude that saved hundreds of innocent people and brightened Schindler's reputation among critical historians... As movie gradually progresses, Schindler's perspective changes much as when he himself states that ""People die - it's a fact of life.""Neeson's flexibility as an actor is impressive... His performance is built on a combination of self-confidence, indecision, and doubt... His character is always evolving, yet always convincing... His transformation from 'war profiteer' to a ""righteous"" man is adequately slow and well developed... As the war draws to a close, Schindler decides unexpectedly to evaluate his life... He turns over his gains into a noble cause - and virtually takes his workers away from being swallowed up by the Holocaust... In one of the film's most touching scenes, Schindler goes to Auschwitz and fights for the freedom of the wives and children of his workers...Ben Kingsley plays the role of Itzhak Stern, the timid gifted accountant, and the silent partner wary of his employer and the enemy... Stern (spared from the horrors of the holocaust) is also Schindler's good angel... He occasionally reminds the audacious man that he could get in a lot of trouble if his true motives are ever discovered... Kingley delivers history's judgment of Oskar Schindler in a touching moment: 'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.'Ralph Fiennes brilliantly portrays Amon Goethe, the complex study of a sadistic true monster... He is a heartless and cruel killer, with a complicated, twisted personality... Stripped to the waist and overlooking the prison yard, he leaves his mistress Ingrid (Beatrice Macola) in bed to shoot arbitrarily, with his scope rifle, slow-moving Jews from the veranda of his high villa...Goeth despises Jews, yet he inexplicably falls in love with a shy Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz). Rather than allowing himself to touch her, and nearly committing the capital crime of kissing her, he remembers that he is supposed to hate her, and beats her ruthlessly for seducing him...Goeth is a man to despise... But the full scope of his atrocities are not entirely shown... Spielberg shows carefully as much of the horror as the screen can bear...The savage scenes are difficult to watch... Spielberg's camera pans to the pillar of dark smoke rising from the chimney stack into the frightening sky of Auschwitz, and to the lines of Jews unknowingly lead toward the gas chambers...Spielberg captures the terror of the Nazi reign in the terrifying dramatic moments when stunned women and children are mistakenly sent to Auschwitz... The disturbing images of arbitrary murder are harshly realistic...'Schindler's List' assaults the viewer with lasting images of Jewish prisoners announcing their names as they are registered, given work assignments, or separated into ""essential"" and ""non-essential.""Spielberg focuses on children and uses them both as victimizers and victims... In a powerful way to personalize the slaughter without a single word, Spielberg colors the coat of a little girl as she is invisibly making her way, aimless and alone, through the chaotic destruction of the Krakow ghetto... (It's almost the same shade as the jacket worn by the young protagonist of Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun', in a similar situation when he's alone in a mob and trying to find his way home).'Schindler's List' is a tribute to those who lost their lives in the Holocaust, a dramatic recreation of that dark, frightening period during World War II... The horror is alleviated, slightly, by Janusz Kaminski's stunning Black and White cinematography... The lack of color reminds us of German Expressionist films, and allows Spielberg to be explicit without becoming tastelessly graphic... John Williams' tragic and somber, almost unnoticed score adds to the melancholy tone...Spielberg's great visual moments - when, in a scene, Schindler joins the Nazis on the platform as they fire the cold water at the cars on the desperate, suffocating people inside...'Schindler's List' is an outstanding movie... It has an important role in adding credibility to the Holocaust, and in Thomas Keneally's fact-based novel, Spielberg finds the right balance of redemption and sorrow.. He makes us watch and feel the extermination through the actions of Oskar Schindler..."	5.0	Spielberg's cinema is simply great!	2007-01-12	5	4	1

How a German, not a German jew, a German turns out to save people's lives from the horrors of the holocaust.THE PROBLEM:  How ironic this may seem, There is a racist element going on here, it can be called a one sided element, a distortion of history, denial, etc, etc.  When people think of the Holocaust, they think of the persecution of the Jewish people - this is correct, this DID happen, 6 million of them and were Hitler's worst scapegoat to destroy.  BUT here is the catch, the ""Holocaust""  IS NOT just the persecution of the Jewish people, there were NON-JEWISH people persecuted as well.  Most people know this as well, but it never seems to surface or be taught enough by holocaust institutions.  Usually, these instittuions are it seems to be run by Jewish people themselvs.  I work at a community college and in my buidling is a little Holocaust Museum, from what I see and heard the curator of the museum teach people is about the persection of the Jews, ONLY the jews.  In the museuem is about only the Jews who were persecuted.  This IS racism on the part of these Jewish people.  Jewish people can be racist you ask????  YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They are people like anybody else, and they have all the human fallicies of other humans as well. Being a Jewish person DOES NOT make you free of racism or ignorance.  To think that way is totally obsurd.  There were Christians, Homosexuals, gypsies, Jehovah Witnesses, mentally and physcally handicapped, and slavs put in camps and suffered the SAME fate as the jewish people did, I DON'T see anything about them in the little Holocaust Museum where I work.  I see one sidedism here, I see a distortion of history and denial here.  And I see people who for their own ignorant reasons are doing the wrong thing morally.  Point being?  Many Jews who are in charge of this Holocaust movement, are racist people.  Promoting Jewish Supremacy in the sense of who was only persecuted.  The Holocaust isn't just the slaughter of Jewish people, contrary of what they want you to think, it's the slaughter of many people.  ANY Holocaust museum should have the truth of what happened, that is EVERYBODY that was persecuted.  Shame on these Jewish people who are just as bad as the Klansman next store.  If you want to e-mail me and talk about this review, any disagreements or whatever PLEASE e-mail me at: greatgeneralhannibal@lycos.com  I'll be glad to talk. My heart goes out to the Jewish people who died in the Holocaust AND to the non-Jewish people who died in the Holocaust.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2YGVSTELYMSS5	Robin C. Smith	"The holocaust is surely about the most difficult event or series of events to understand or depict. Very few films have succeeded. The rather cheesy 70s TV series ""Holocaust"", although a reasonable try at it for prime time TV, comes to mind. Here Spielberg presents in an almost completely non-sugar-coated way, with believable people and events, a view of the holocaust as it happened in and around Cracow. It needs to be said that the original book is outstanding too - without this as the source for the film, the film would probably not have worked. Harrowing, horrible and still incredible to believe. The way people speak and the things they say appears to have the authentic feel of the period. The soundtrack is outstanding - unbelievably real sounds of shooting and the clink of cartridges on pavements (shells on sidewalks) make this a very difficult and uncomfortable viewing experience. Just as it should be, of course. This deserves five stars without any doubt. If I must find anything to criticize, then I think there are three things that were unnecessary. Why black and white? The events took place in color - the world was not black and white - why not show it in its real hues? Well, we know why black and white was chosen, but I do think that black and white=old or a long time ago is a bit of a clich&eacute;. The photography is astounding anyway. Why did Goetz and some of the others have to speak their lines in a faux German accent? This seems unnecessary - surely in this film they were largely all speaking German? Still this is a small point. The most serious breakdown and something that was apparently made up for the film was Schindler's emotional farewell at the end. It was not in the book, it did not need to be in the film and should not have been. The film would not have been diminished by omitting this faint touch of treacle. What Schindler had done for ""his"" Jews was clear - words spelling it all out were just not necessary. But these are small criticisms of a masterpiece."	5.0	Almost perfect	2002-04-12	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3TOQAMJURAYFC	Roland Dark	"""Schindler's List"" is Steven Spielberg's powerful and emotionally charged adaption of Thomas Keneally's novel, the fact based story of Oskar Schindler, member of the Nazi party and war profiteer who, by an extraordinary act of redemption, saved the lives of more than 1,000 polish Jews during the holocaust.Straightforward and unsentimental, apropriately filmed in black & white without the use of storyboards--the gritty camera work avoids the ""slick"" look often seen in most Hollywood motion pictures. That is because ""Schindler's List"" is something different than most Hollywood motion pictures. Despite its 187 minute duration, ""Schindler's List"" moves along at a brisk pace; Spielberg never spends too much or too little time in any scene.Entire cast is excellent, notably: Liam Neeson is superb as Oskar Shindler; Ben Kingsly is endearing as Schindler's mild mannered accountant, Itzhak Stern; Ralph Feines is all too convincing as the execrable concentration camp commandant, Amon Goeth; Embeth Davidtz begs sympathy as Helen Hirsch, the Jewish servant and object of Goeth's perverse desires.Buyoed by an intelligently written screenplay, Steven Spielberg has once again delivered nothing short of a masterpiece (definitely his personal best in a plethora of triumphs), and perhaps the finest motion picture ever.Often difficult to watch, ""Schindler's List"" effectively conveys the terror and hopelessness experienced by the more than 6,000,000 innocent victims of Hitler's ""Final Solution"".

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	Steven Spielberg uses his formidable gifts as a commercial director, and manipulator of our emotions, to excellent effect in his big, sentimental film about Oscar Schindler, and, in a much grander way, the entire  experience of the Holocaust.  Though there are touches of Spielbergian  magic dust sprinkled throughout, the overall effect of this movie is so  shockingly powerful you can easily forgive them, and him.  I found this  movie to be mesmerizing, and the first and only depiction of the specific  atrocities of the darkest time in our collective, and recent, past, that  made it real to me.  The first waves of incredulousness begin with the  creation of the ghetto in the first hour; the simple fact that one would be  told to leave their home behind spun me around in my seat -- yes, I had  heard all of this before, but had never seen the haunting faces and  specific people Spielberg here focuses on so deftly.  I think this movie  puts human faces on a tragedy so big and broad that it often becomes  numbingly gigantic -- too difficult to take in on its own terms.  Here,  instead, we get a small group of fascinating characters placed in  extraordinary circumstances.  Ralph Fiennes is so compellingly evil that he  makes a case for the seductive nature of the devil himself.  John  Williams's score is another insidious example of expert movie music that  plays in your head for days.  It is the finale that bothers me the most,  though it is not worth taking a star off -- it is so over-the-top  sentimental that it feels incongruous and unfair to the rest of the movie  -- which is, after all, a movie -- not a documentary.  That said, I think  that this movie should be essential viewing for teenagers everywhere.  It  tells a story that is rich with history; it exudes a sense of humanity and  resilience and goodness; as commercial pop art, it does not get more  effective or powerful than this.	5.0	EXCELLENT	1999-12-17	3	2	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2JCGI5QI9FIBD	"R. Short ""robertsathard"""	Back in January of 1994 my friend Ryan and I went to the AMC theater to see the new Steven Spielberg film Schindler's List. I knew nothing about this movie. I had no idea what the title referred to. I just new it was a Spielberg movie and with the exceptions of a couple of misses such as Hook and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, that name meant quality. So I picked up a box of Red Vines, took my seat next to Ryan and sat down and watched this movie. For the next three hours I sat in my seat and my eyes never left the screen. I felt shock, anger, sadness, and dread. I cried a few times. Heck, I even giggled a few times. But I was never bored. At the end of the movie as the lights turned on my Red Vines sat in my lap untouched.Now ten years after winning the Academy Award for best picture Schindler's List is now available on DVD. The movie Schindler's List presents Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, as a flawed man. Yes, he did save 1,100 Jews from death, but that is towards the end of the movie. During the first two thirds of the movie Schindler is seen as a man who is disloyal to his wife, bribes officials, and uses the tragedy with the Jewish people as a means of acquiring great wealth. Towards the end of World War II Schindler learns that the Jews are to be sent to Auschwitz to be exterminated. He devises a plan, with the help of his financial manager Itzhak Stern, played by Ben Kingsley, to purchase the Jews and save them from certain doom.As the movie opens we learn that the Jews are being dumped into ghettoes. They are arriving at more than 10.000 a day. They are robbed of their property, they homes, and their dignity. Those Jews who are skilled laborers are spared as they can serve a purpose for the Germans. Those who do not, such as teachers and musicians, are more likely to perish. An hour into the movie there is a segment called The Liquidation of the Ghetto in which those Jews who serve no purpose are murdered. This is a long, tense undertaking to watch. There have been a lot of movies in which there are long rampage scenes, but often the violence becomes repetitive and dull. This time each death is like a blow to the head. It's a horrible experience watching so many murders.Ralph Fiennes plays Amon Goth, the head of the German SS. Fiennes plays the role of Goth on the right note. His steely eyes and calculating manner are a far cry from the Nazi's portrayed in the first and second Indiana Jones movies. In those movies the Nazi's were portrayed as comic book villains. This time Goth is played as a man who will kill another without hesitation for no other reason than he had no use for them. At times he kills for his own satisfaction. At other times he kills in what he believes is part of his job. There is a scene in which he complains about the mass killing as it means more work for him He is also a man of great contradiction. As much as he hates the Jews he falls in love with on. Watching him fall for his Jewish maid is horrifying. He wants to love her but at the same time he (In his twisted mind) feels she is subhuman. Unfortunately, the maid receives many beatings at his hands because he cannot contain his feelings for her.This movie is pretty much flawless except for one detail. The movie focuses on Schindler and Goth but not on the Jews themselves. We get to know some by name, but we don't know of their lives before this tragedy took place. We know they are scared , they fighting for survival, and many of them keep hope alive. However, we don't know them. They are background characters. If you would like to see a similar movie that focuses on the lives of the Jews I would like to recommend The Pianist. Having said that Schindler's List is still one of the best movies ever made. I this movie 5 stars.Now some remarks about the DVD. Universal decided to play it cheap this time and make this a single disc set as opposed to a two DVD set. That means Schindler's List is a flipper. Titanic is just as long and fits on a single disc side. The extras are really nothing to write home about. Now this comes in two versions. The disc buy itself and a $60 collectors edition. I wish I saved my money. It comes in a Plexiglas case for reason I have no idea. I guess if there is a freak earthquake in El Paso and all my DVD's are destroyed I'll still have Schindler's List. It also comes with the soundtrack (I could have bought both the no frills DVD and the soundtrack for about $35) and a book with a bunch of pictures. If you want this movie I suggest going with just the DVD and not the boxed set. I give the DVD of Schindler's List 3 stars.	4.0	The Movie Deserves A Better DVD Treatment	2004-03-09	8	5	3

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A5ED5O36DOLQZ	R. Walls	Watching this film has a profound effect on me every time I watch it. The thought that only 60 years ago, people were capable of committing such abominations towards their fellow man.The genius of this film is that it allows you a glimpse of what life might have been like if, instead of the people portrayed in the movie, people like ourselves were living in german occupied territory during WWII. The lack of hope and humanity that these people had to face every day truly humbles the viewer.I find that when I'm watching this film, the question that reverberates through my mind - is simply WHY? Yes, it's a film; yes, those are actors you are watching; YES THAT REALLY HAPPENED! 6 million people were slaughtered at the whim of a mad man, they were treated as though they were lower than animals, just for their beliefs.I thank Steven Spielberg for deciding to make this film, and realise that it must have been a somewhat harrowing experience to dredge up this murderous experience. It allows not just Oskar Schindler, but other's like him, to begin to get the recognition they deserve; and those who COULD have done something and didn't can hang their heads in shame.This movie helps to show us that one person CAN make a difference, but who can honestly say that they could be as courageous as he was in such a terrible time?This film is the best I've seen in years. It gets you where you live because, if we entertain for a moment the thought that the Nazi's had won the war, that or something like it would probably have been in store for us, if not for men like Schindler.	5.0	Haunting, Powerful and Humbling	2004-09-04	4	3	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A32DYEEOIOBCEP	Ryan	A classic and beautifully crafted masterpiece, Schindler&#8217;s List is an absolute must see! What is accomplished through Spielberg&#8217;s top notch directing is a very watchable, yet gritty, real and personal depiction of the horrors of life during the Holocaust. The film opens with the traditional Hebrew blessing over wine and from there turns to black and white pretty quickly. Some find it difficult to watch a movie with no color but I must say that I think it definitely accomplishes something in this case. Spielberg did not stray from showing much this film in the name of realism and I feel that the lack of color granted the audience the comfort to really witness and empathize with the victims of such atrocities. As well as adding a bit of an ole&#8217; timey feel to the picture the lack of color might make it just a little easier to stomach a movie centered on such brutal, devastating, disgusting, and often gory events.Labeled an &#8220;epic historical drama,&#8221; it is no real surprise that such a massive subject eats up a lengthy 3hrs. and 15min. Though briefly slow at points, the film consistently progresses very well and didn&#8217;t feel too long. Originally released in 1993 this picture retains an often difficult to find aspect of timelessness that is definitely appreciable in dated film. The main character, Oskar Schindler is portrayed by Liam Neeson. Schindler is a Nazi party member who is in search of a fortune. Gaining control of a factory, Schindler and his Jewish assistant begin hiring mostly Jewish workers due to their cheaper labor costs. Eventually Schindler witnesses the tragedies of the Holocaust first hand, especially taking notice of a young girl in a red coat (one of the only color additions to the entire film). After later noticing a small bright red coat in a pile of bodies (implying the death of the child he&#8217;d previously noticed) Schindler&#8217;s focus progressively transforms from making money into saving as many lives as he possibly can. Through his repeatedly giving more than anyone would ever have asked of him in bribes and strategic moves Schindler is able to save the lives of over a thousand Jews, though in the end feels terrible guilt and thinks that he should have done much more.As the war comes to an end Oskar Schindler flees due to the fact that he would have been seen as a profiteer and war criminal. This movie deals with an unusual and not often seen aspect of an incredibly horrific event that affected one of the world&#8217;s largest religions, eventually reducing its total numbers by more than six million. The Jewish religion, people, and traditions makeup an influential and beautiful patch in the diverse cultural fabric of our world and their story is a vital element in our collective history. Creatively adapted to display extreme brutality in as gentile a way as possible, this film is a treasure and should be experienced by everyone at least once.	5.0	!Spoiler Alert!

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1J0CA4ANNZHNC	Ryan Lindsay	Schindler's ListThough you see Oscar Schindler in most of this film's scenes, heis primarily the narrator of this story, because the film is lessabout him than it is about triumph of the human spirit and survi-ving at a time when survival wasn't even one of the options.He is portrayed by Neeson as cold and calculating, motivatedonly by the expectation of windfall profits, but as the film unfolds,the viewer witnesses his uneasy transition to that of a manhaunted by the horrors of mindless genocide. In the film's mostpoignant moment, Oscar witnesses the obliteration of the Warsawghetto through the eyes of one little girl, desparately seekinga way out--but finding none. It is in this moment that WE seeall too clearly the single-minded ruthlessness with which theNazis' pursued the complete extermination of European jews.And what we discovered in this cinematic journey is that OscarSchindler was a man who failed at every thing he ever tried toaccomplish, except for the ONE thing he was truly meant to do.	5.0	Triumph of the Human Spirit	2002-10-13	1	1	0

This is a haunting tale that brings out the horrible truth of the Holocaust. And the part that really strikes you when the credits start playing is that this is all 100% real.People de-humanized simply because they were born Jewish, who are stripped of their reasons to live. But even greater then that it shows the strength of the human spirit when one truley has the will to live. And the strength of one man, Oskar Schindler, a sinner destined for hell, who steps up and puts his life on the line to help innocent men and woman who face almost certain death.In the end, when Schindler obtains the gold ring, in Hebrew is inscribed a proverb that should never be forgotten.	5.0	A Magnicificent, Extraordinary Tale	2004-11-18	6	3	3

It did not cross my mind until later that my friend and I were by far the youngest people in the theater.  The youngest by about 60 years would be my guess...  It began to dawn on me what was happening when I noticed the gentleman in front of me reciting the Hebrew prayers and scriptures along with the screen, and on the way out to the lobby after the film I noticed more than one person with a number tatooed on their wrist.  Later in the film everyone in the theater was moved to tears, and I was weeping openly right along... thinking &quot;my friend is gonna think I am a wimp!&quot;...  then I heard him sob, and decided it was o.k.This film is one of the most powerful and moving experiences of my life.  I think it should be mandatory for all World History high school classes to see it, because it really helps the reality of man's inhumanity to man sink in in a way that a history book seldom can.  It contains a beautiful true life story set in the midst of true life horror.  A definate must see for the subject matter and story alone...  but when you add in the fact that it is also a masterpeice of the cinematographer's art in every way...  it is a film you can rewatch on many different levels.  Get it....  See it.	5.0	Should be Required in School	2001-12-20	5	4	1

For example, I found the parting scene near the end unneccessarily sentimental and out of place in a film that otherwise had fantastically realistic scenes and  dialogue throughout. But Schindeler's list is a cut above a majority of  films produced this century. The acting, particularly Ralph Fiennes as Amon  Goethe, is unsurpassed. The cinematography is excellent and the music is  haunting (I would recommend buying the soundtrack as well as this video).  I'll admit it's not for everyone because although it gives a glimpse of the  better side of human nature it also shows the worst of humanity and can be  quite disturbing. It is by far the most moving film I have ever  seen.Horribly compelling viewing.	5.0	Enchanting	1999-12-06	2	2	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1JHYF8PDQEQ8R	Sarah M.	Absolutely awesome movie! For a guy that loves color in my movies, I really could appreciate the purpose and feel that black and white gave the movie. The fact that color was used but for the reasoning that we could focus on how Schindler viewed things. This film was also very powerful from the standpoint of the holocaust which of course is the reason for the film. Studying Judaism and the fact that this review is for my world religion class, I really was able to have a better understanding of why this movie was so highly regarded and critically acclaimed. I was able to see the hatred displayed and the torture emphasized on a culture for what they had no control of. Although it was the Jewish leaders in Jesus' time that wanted Him crucified, the people that were being tortured had nothing to do with that. Being an African-American, that would be like me blaming all Caucasians for what those who ridiculed, enslaved, and mistreated Africans brought over from Africa for the crime. This movie did help to show the increase of consciousness people developed over time as the onslaught was taking place.Obviously there was a war fought but it was more the fact that people began taking the view that I stated earlier, don't brutalize them for what somebody else did. Being a man with stature as Schlindler was, it was awesome to see him use this to assist not only the Jewish workers, but to help those around him to understand and take a stand. His stance helped to open the doors for many a people to help sustain a community and culture. I will admit that I was skeptical of even viewing this film because of the many other depictions of the holocaust, but I am very glad I did. One thing I will say, is that no matter what film I watch that relates to the holocaust, The Diary of Anne Frank always comes to mind. Great movie, great cast, great theme, awesome message.	4.0	Judaism Awareness	2014-07-07	0	0	0

It made me sick  to watch the scenes where corpses are being transported. Not because the  subject of the scenes were gruesome, but because the scenes are  sensationalized with overtly tear-jerking music as if to say &quot;this is  the part where you're supposed to cry.&quot; The girl in the red dress was  just a sad attempt at symbolism and was so contrived. It was one of the  film's shallow attempts at complexity. Never before has a movie been such  an ideal example of &quot;Oscar-Bait.&quot; The way the movie was made just  cries out &quot;this is an important movie!&quot; or &quot;you must respect  me as a masterpiece!&quot; The over-indulgence with technique makes a  mockery of the Holocaust. The movie is even manipulative to the last minute  when people are putting stones on Schindler's grave and there is a long  forced moment of silence that is purposefully there to get the audience to  contemplate what they've just seen. The movie is so self-conscious  concerning it's own importance. There are many great movies made about the  horrors of the Holocaust. This is not one of them. It's better if you see  documentaries on the subject which are by far more informing.	3.0	Not a great movie	2000-02-26	31	16	15

But here it is 2004 and this studio has *finally* released this epic film on an unnecessarily (GAG!) two-sided DVD packaged in (GAG!) cardboard. What's even worse than having to get up and flip the disc over in the middle of the film is that the stupid DVD won't default to the DTS sound track. It's got that insulting message that assumes we consumers don't know what DTS is. And on my first viewing, I realized 75% thru that I was no longer hearing the better DTS soundtrack after the flip. That was so annoying it just ruined the whole experience for me.	2.0	The worst DVD release ever?	2004-03-11	44	29	15

Gripping, moving, tear jerking, uplifting, top notch acting, stunning photography, script line in synch with the book, true life ending, OMG.  This is the story of Oskar Schindler who kept over 1,000 people alive during the Nazi reign.  This is a movie (and book) you must watch (or read) to believe.  I generally do not care for ""war"" movies, and although I love splatter films and gory fiction books, I despise real life violence.  Having once been a victim of violent crime, I have a relationship with real life horror that I do not like to explore, but the heroism of this story so dramatically overwhelms the real horrors that it is a must see for anyone.  Liam Neeson is phenomenal in his role as Schindler, and Ben Kingsley along with Ralph Finnes fills out the superb acting.  Difficult to watch, impossible to forget, it is truly the story of heroism on its grandest scale.The most poignant moment is the one, the only, faded splash of faint color in the little girls red coat; the rest of the movie is black and white, which only adds to the impact of the total emotion of this fantastic film."	5.0	Horrible subject brought beautifully to film	2003-08-14	17	16	1

Undeniably driven by sincerity, Spielberg's Oscar-winning Best Picture is alternately impressive, maudlin, focused and well-acted. Filmed in black and white, the film deals with the Nazi extermination of Polish Jews and how one man, Oskar Schindler, transformed from a philandering opportunist (and Nazi profiteer) to a capitalist saviour to 1,200 imprisoned Jews. With fluid camerawork, Spielberg re-creates life for Krakow's Jews during Nazi occupation - from resettlements in the ghetto to their internment in the camps. Schindler is ably portrayed by Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley as an accountant who assists Schindler and Ralph Fiennes as camp commander Amon Goeth are especially effective. Spielberg's scenes of Nazi atrocities are definitely emotionally wretching."	5.0	BOLD & AFFECTING.	2002-07-09	2	1	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A33TLFRRVNTYIE	"Scott A. Otto ""film buff"""	"I originally saw this movie in a theater, and as the audience filed out I noticed that they were utterly silent. This film affected me as profoundly as any film I have seen, before or since. Spielberg has captured the inhumanity of the Holocaust, close-up and stark. Rather than comment through dialogue or use of the camera on the Nazis' hatred of the Jews, Spielberg instead let the actions speak for themselves. And those actions scream at you, tear at your soul, haunt you forever.After watching the second time (I have viewed this DVD several dozen times), I realized that this particular picture has a look and a feel unlike anything I have seen from Hollywood - or anywhere else, for that matter. The black-and-white photography adds to the dingy, dirty feel of the entire movie. The violence is spontaneous and jarring, totally random and yet more frightening because of its randomness...anyone could be next. By the time the train bearing Schindler's women arrives at Auschwitz-Birkenau, the killing has desensitized us to a point,  only to face the new horror of killing on a whole other level. Many shots haunt me from ""List"", but two remain with me - The mountains of luggage, shoes, eyeglasses, etc. after loading Jews on cattle cars in Krakow, and the giant chimney at Auschwitz belching its human flame and smoke high into the night sky.This film is important for future generations, to keep the memory of the Holocaust firmly in our minds' eye. I would recommend it to all people, although children under the age of 14 or 15 may wish to wait to watch it until they have gotten a bit older."	5.0	"A ""must-see"" if ever there was one!"	2006-04-30	3	1	2
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AU7VONGGS8GIO	scott belba	This is one of the best films ever made. I have never been so engrossed in a film as this one. Liam Neeson play's Oscar Schindler a nazi, and buisiness man. He is happy about the war becouse it make's him money. He is a selfish, greedy man who care's only about money. In the beginning. He enlists the help (slave labor) of Itzhak Stern played by the brilliant Ben Kingsley, to help him get his plant of field kits going for the war. However after Amon Goeth played by Ralph Fiennes shows up and cleans out a jewish housing project Schindler can not stand back, and he becomes a real hero in a time and place where they were in short supply.The acting in this movie is first rate. Neeson,Fiennes,Embeth Davidtz and Kingsley are at there best. Spielberg is at top form. This is a long movie but worth the watch. If at the end when Oskar tell's Stern that he could have gotten more you'r heart does not break it never will. This is a movie about triumph in the mose dire of conditions.	5.0	Amazing....	2002-03-23	2	1	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AK33LYAYV52OX	scott otto	Of course, Schindler's List is a classic. And yes, Steven Spielberg is one of our most important directors. But what Spielberg has achieved in this movie towers above anything he has ever done....he has taken a true story, one of powerful emotion, and fabricated a legacy for all people to remember.This movie is unlike anything I have ever seen before. Despite Spielberg's use of gritty B&W;, which makes the viewer focus completely on the story, there are shots so powerful and intense that you scarcely notice. Scenes that play over and over in my head include the little girl running through the Warsaw ghetto during the liquidation of the Jews; concentration camp women pricking their fingers and rubbing blood into their cheeks in an attempt to appear healthier, and thus less apt to be sent to the gas chambers; and most of all, entering Auschwitz, replete with Nazi guards, barking dogs, and a slow pan upward to the giant brick chimney, belching smoke and flame into the night. Knowing the fuel of that fire makes it that much more monstrous.Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley tower over all in their respective lead roles, but Spielberg's use of little known actors in key roles succeeds beautifully. I imagine the emotional level during shooting was extremely high, and it shows in the performances.This movie will grow in importance as time passes, not only for its technical genius, but also for presenting the viewer with as vivd a reminder of man's inhumanity to man as one could ever hope for. When I attended this movie in the theater, there was an intermission, at which point most of the patrons talked and smoked together. But at the film's conclusion, everyone simply filed out of the theater in silence. Nobody spoke a word. The film had spoken many volumes for us all.	5.0	One of Hollywood's Most Important Moments	2002-04-09	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ	Sean Pasek	"Schindler's List may well be Steven Spielberg's crowning masterpiece.  This is quite an achievement considering his other great films like E.T. and Saving Private Ryan.  Schindler's List is one of the most compelling films that I've ever seen.  You find yourself horrified and moved at the same time.  Anyone who truly believes that one person can't make a difference should add this film to their list.The story concerns how Oskar Schindler, a philandering, womanizing businessman finds himself with an opportunity to literally save the lives of over a thousand Jews.  This is not what he initially sets out to do.  His intial desire is to make money.  He has the charisma and money to sway and bribe high military officials to do what he wants.  There is a scene where a Jewish woman comes to him to ask that he take her parents into his factory because she knows it's safe.  Schindler becomes angry concerning this.  However, as much as Schindler would like to distance himself from his Jewish workers as well as the tragic events surrounding the holocaust, he can't.  The initial reason for him using Jewish workers is because they are the cheapest.The first scene that starts to make an indelible impression is during the elimination of the Jewish population in Krakow.  Schindler sits on a horse overlooking the small town and watches in horror as Jewish people are slaughtered.  Spielberg uses a brilliant touch here as we follow a small, blond girl in red as she runs and weaves herself through this mass murder.  Schindler is unable to take his eyes off of her.The power behind this story really begins when Schindler decides to use his mass fortune to literally buy the lives of his workers.  And the one scene that still touches me so powerfully each and every time I watch this movie, is at the end when Schindler is sobbing uncontrollably for not saving even more lives because he wasted so much of his money.This is Liam Neeson's best performance, in my opinion.  And as good as Tom Hanks was in Philadelphia, I really believe that Liam should have taken the Oscar for this film.  He gives Oskar Schindler such humanistic qualities that changes throughout the film.  At first, he's simply a powerful businessman whose sole desire is to make money.  He loves women, find foods, and clothes.  Finally, his attachments and deeper feelings develop toward his workers.  Evidence of this blossoms to a point where he reminds one of his workers that it's Friday, the Sabbath, as he gives his worker a bottle of wine so that he and others may commemorate the Jewish day.Ben Kingsley is wonderful as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's personal secretary and accountant.  Kingsley plays Stern as a vey skeptical man who really isn't sure of Schindler's motives.  This is especially true when Schindler talks the Jewish businessmen into giving him all of their cash so that he can get is factory running.  Stern's views of Schindler slowly soften as he realizes that there is something deeper in Schindler than he ever realized.  And, of course, this comes forth when Schindler confesses to Stern that he is, in fact, using his money to buy his Jewish workers.  And while Schindler never says so outright, we know that he is NOT buying them to be his workers as much as he's trying to save their lives.  In the end, Stern knows and understands this.One can't talk about the performances of Schindler's List without mentioning Ralph Fiennes as the sadistic Amon Goeth.  Here is a German commander who sees the Jewish people as nothing more than animals.  He shoots them arbitrarily from the top of his villa which overlooks the Jewish camp.  The slightest offense is met with execution.  There is a brief time when Schindler explains to Goeth what true power is.  ""Real power is when we have every reason to kill, but we don't.  This is why a king pardons a person who's done something wrong.""  At first Goeth practices this, but ultimately, he takes too much pleasure in killing the Jewish people.  He could easily top the list as one of the most disliked characters in film history.I think an aspect of this film that really makes it powerful is the cinematic score of John Williams.  The use of the violin, especially from world renowned violinist, Itzhak Perlman, is so effective in how it conveys the tragedy of the holocaust.  The tune is simple, but it finds a way to burn itself into your mind until you hear the tune well after the film has ended.Schindler's List can be a difficult film to watch, but in so many ways, it is important to the history of humanity to understand what transpired among the Jewish population, with the hopes and assurances that nothing like this will ever happen again.Most people don't realize that most ""heroes"" are not perfect beings.  And Oskar Schindler, in this film, is certainly not depicted as being what you might think of a saint to be.  He's simply a man who does something amazing.  Each and every person out there is capable of doing the same thing.  There are many such examples throughout history, both in the past and today.  But it's always great to hear about these people, for they help to bring true inspiration to our hearts and souls that even admist the darkest hours, there is always the light of hope."	5.0	"""Whoever Saves One Life, Saves the World Entire"""	2007-05-05	4	3	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1DM5CN9BARLQN	Shakera	Schindler's List gives us three major stories and a host of minor ones. First and foremost, it tells the tale of the Holocaust, presenting new images of old horrors. These are as ghastly and realistic as anything previously filmed, and Spielberg emphasizes the brutality of the si... read moretuation by not pulling punches when it comes to gore. The blood, inky rather than crimson in stark black-and-white, fountains when men and women are shot in the head or through the neck.The second story is that of Oskar Schindler, the Nazi businessman who saved 1200 Jews from death. Schindler starts out as a self-centered manufacturer, concerned only about making money. He hires Jews because they're cheap, not because he likes them. But his perspective changes, and he risks losing everything to save as many lives as he can. His eventual lament that he couldn't save more is heartbreaking.The third story belongs to Amon Goeth, the Nazi commander of Krakow, a man who teeters on the brink of madness. Despite his intense hatred for Jews, he is inexplicably attracted to his Jewish housekeeper, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz). Disgusted by his feelings, he lashes out at her with a display of violence that is almost Scorsese-like in its blunt presentation. As written, Goeth could easily have become a conscienceless monster, but Spielberg works carefully to show unexpected depth and complexity to his character.Often, the experiences of the minor characters provide the most lasting images. Helen's story is memorable, as is the plight of young Danka Dresner and her mother as they strive to avoid death while staying together. There's a Jewish couple that marries in the Plaszow camp, even though their chances of survival are dim, and a Rabbi who survives a close encounter with a Nazi gun.As this story relates to World Religions, I feel that the Jews in Germany was targeted because of their religous beliefs but we must all remember that anyone who wasn't of German blood was a target for extermination by the Nazi's. Jews were targeted because they were easily indentified because of the color of they hair and the darkened skin tone. Their peaceful disposition made them vulnerable also.	4.0	World Religion Schindler's List Movie Review	2011-03-29	0	0	0

And I thought, big deal. But the movie has some very vivid, poignant moments. There are enough characters, enough motivations, enough idiosyncrasies to make the screenplay rich enough to keep us always involved. Yet, the director does not shy from the humanity of the bad guys and the shortcomings of the good ones.Ben Kingsley makes for a fabulous fidgety character, ever so worried but in a palpable outwardly manner. Liam Neeson as the pivot is very convincing. But the cake I feel goes to Ralph Fiennes who mastered the European accent of English to such perfection that I almost scorned him as a true soldier of the war. His casual demeanor while shooting a couple of workers in the camps from his balcony was a sight to behold.BUT the most stunning thing about this movie, as it unfolds, is the pang of conscience in a simple man that made all the difference in the lives of so many. The gruesome scenes of the lives lost in the dastardly &quot;war&quot; is etched in my memory, and the number of people Schindler saved was impressive, but the thing I remember having being touched MOST by is how such an imperfect man found himself doing something so perfect.All in all, despite the undeservedly featureless DVD that Universal has slapped this movie on, it must be a prominent part of every movie collection!	5.0	CONSCIENCE: THAT SLENDER EMOTION THAT MAKES US THE SAME	2004-05-21	14	11	3

ONe cannot help but be impacted by the raw reality that Spielberg reveals. Liam Neeson is the character whom Spielberg wants us all to be identified with. Neeson's character, underneath all the the seemingly inpenetrable disguise which he puts on, has a soft heart. This is especially seen in the scene whcih he drops to his knees and weeps knowing that he should have done more to save lives. Spielberg intertwines authentic Holocaust footage with personal character studies. THis is truly one of the few films that will not only stay with you many days after it is seen, but prompt you to do a little heart searching of your own. ONe cannot be unaffected by the showing of this absolute disregard for humanity and the atrocities which was committed by the Nazis. Spielbergs central character, Schindler, is one whom he and we all can identify with. Throughout the film, we can feel and understand every action and emotion which he goes through.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A13IKSGDYNBNQS	S J Buck	In the list of major films that Spielberg has made this is the one above all others that everyone should see.Its the true story of Oscar Schindler, a paid up member of the Nazi party who saved the lives of around 1,100 Jews in WW2.Liam Neeson plays Schindler brilliantly, but the whole cast are excellent. It would be unfair to pick out any one person, such as Neeson, since for example Ralph Fiennes is also brilliant as a ruthless camp commandant. I've seen the film 3 or 4 times now and its one of the few films that has brought me close to tears, as true horror of the Holocaust is brought to life.What Schindler did shows a side of humanity that most of us will never see. At great personal risk, because he realised that people were being slaughtered, he bribed Nazi officials and ensured in the process that his factory never produced anything useful for the Nazi's. Scene after haunting scene is left etched on your memory. Perhaps for me, where Schindler hoses down the people who are packed into the trains in unbearable heat sums up the whole movie for me. He needn't of helped them, they were going to die anyway, but he did. We all know about mans inhumanity to man, but here is a demonstration of one mans great humanity. So whilst the film is very sad and emotional on one level, because of Schindlers actions the film doesn't leave you in a state of manic depression at the end!Its a fabulous movie and at 3hours and 7mins it is long, but you will never look at your watch, its that good.	5.0	Spielbergs finest moment	2007-07-26	2	2	0

Be prepared to cry, be angry, and at the same time remember that even in bad situations good people still exist.	5.0	A remarkable movie about a remarkable man	2003-12-17	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1VBYS3G8NQUY1	SKOLVK	Schindler's list stands alone as the most important movie made about the holocaust. No other film comes close to it's message and delivery than perhaps Roman Polanski's &quot;Pianist&quot;. I first saw &quot;Schindler's list&quot; when I was in middle school and what I saw capitivated me and sparked a desire in me to learn more about the subject. My history classes up until that point had mentioned the holocaust but never provided me with any indepth or important information. &quot;Schindler's list&quot; is excellent in depicting the brutality in which the Germans operated. The Germans exterminated whole towns, used jews as target practice and made them strip naked and run laps like cattle, but most importantly the movie shows how we can change ourselves and do whats right. Whatching Mr. Schindler change though the movie is touching and inspiring. A once petty and corrupt man who plans to use jews as slave labor, Schindler begins to question his morality once his witnesses the horrors of the holocaust first hand. Although many questions about Schindlers character have been analyzed and debated even before the films release, I stand ferm with my respect for what he did. He as been criticized for not doing enough. I say at least he did something. I can't say enough good things about this movie. It is definitaly one of the greatest achievements in modern film making.	5.0	a long time coming.	2004-05-06	13	10	3

Polish is defeated by the German forces.  This means the Jews have to leave their homes and report to the train station to register their names.  More than 10,000 Jews are shipped to Krakow.  This is where the ""ghetto"" is overcrowded with Jews.  The Jewish people bond together and organize into groups.  A German businessman, Oskar Schindler, visit the ""ghetto"" in hopes to see Itzhak Sten, a Jewish pot-making businessman.  For Jews, they are no longer allowed to own businesses.  Schindler makes a deal with him and plans to take over the factory after trading money and appointing Sten as the factory's manager.  All the Jews are now forced to pack their belongings and move out of their homes by German soldiers.  After arriving at the ""ghetto"", the Jews receive housing assignments and are forced to live in tight quarters.  The Jews that cannot work are loaded onto trucks and sent off to camps, while the others work at Schindler's factory.  Schindler tries to protect his factory workers by sending baskets full of goods to many German leaders.  The workers are grateful to Schindler for the jobs because it keeps them out of the camps and alive.  Thousands of Jews were shipped off on a train to concentration camps, where their entire luggage was gone through by German soldiers.  By mistake, Stern was placed on the train and had to be save by Oskar.  Armed German soldiers run though the streets killing the Jews and residents of the ""ghetto"".  Oskar arrives to the camp with lunch for the German men to find that he has no worker anymore.  They were all captured and taken off to the camp.  After getting back his workers, a young lady goes to him wishing for him to hire her parents, so they will live.  He hires them out of kindness.  Some of the Jews got sick, so they had to be separated from the healthy ones at the camp.  All of the weak and sick Jews were killed to make room for the new shipment, so the ladies would prick their fingers and rub their own blood on their faces to make them look healthier.  At Oskar's birthday party, a young girl gives him a gift and in returns he kisses her.  This broke the Race and Resettlement Act by kissing a Jewish girl.  Goeth receives order to burn all the bodies of more than ten thousand Jews killed at the camps.  Schindler builds a new factory and bargains with Goeth to ""buy"" all the Jewish workers that is needed to staff it.  With help from Stern, he draws up a list of names, Schindler's List, consisting of more than one thousand one- hundred men, women, and children.  Racing against time, Schindler was able to rescue all his Jews."	5.0	Schindler's List	2010-04-10	2	1	1

I will always remember the part at the end, when the Jews were placed on the train to freedom.

Smith ""ltcolkiranerys"""	"I have long been a fan of Steven Spielberg's films, but Schindler's List is the first movie of his that has literally moved me to tears.  Based on the book by Thomas Keneally, it tells the story of Oskar Schindler (played by the wonderful Liam Neeson), a womanizer and member of the Nazi Party who nevertheless did his best to help keep Polish Jews from going to the death camps during World War 2.  Outwardly, Schindler is a typical Nazi--hanging out with people such as Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) and trying his level best to run a business during the war.Schindler's List, however, portrays another side to the man--his domestic troubles with his wife, Emilie (Caroline Goodall) because of his womanizing, and the difficulties of trying to keep his business staffed and his Jewish workers from being killed.  In this effort he is assisted by his accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), who recruits families to work for Schindler while Schindler claims they are ""essential workers"" in order to keep them from being executed by German officers on the street.  When the Schindler Jews are about to be moved to another camp, he saves the life of Goeth's maid, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) in a game of chance and puts her name on the list of Jews that are going with him as workers.One of the things I liked most about Schindler's List is the fact that it was filmed in black and white, instead of color.  I felt that filming it in black and white (with the exception of one or two color segments) gave it a gritty sense of realism that added to the story's emotional impact and drama, rather than detracting from it.  This was definitely an inspired choice in making the film.All in all, Schindler's List is a very profound, moving film.  It is my hope that people out there will continue to learn from, and be touched by, this work of Steven Spielberg."	5.0	A moving portrait of a flawed but great man	2003-03-04	4	3	1

Some of the scenes will stay with you long after you have finished watching the movie. It is graphic, and it is realistic. You will see innocent people being murdered and there is no sense of justice for them in the end. That was, sadly, the reality of the Holocaust.With that warning, the movie is definitely worth watching at least once in your lifetime. I think children in upper grades should see it as well, so they realize that the Holocaust killed 6 million individual people, who had lives and personalities.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2KS1GVHDNLTVJ	stephen hodgin	For the chapter on Judaism I watched the movie Schindler's List. This movie starring Liam Neeson who played Oskar Schindler, was based on a true story that took place during the holocaust and WWII. Oskar Schindler was a German business man who owned a company that made kitchen and cookware but was transformed into an ammunition plant for the war. In the beginning he was using the product of Nazi rule and Jews for free labor in his factory where he made a good profit. After realizing many of his employees were heading to death camps he bribes Nazi officials to keep Jewish workers in his factory and ends up saving many Jews by the time the war ends. This movie is very graphic and from what I have read and learned in the past about the holocaust it is unfortunately quite realistic. Schindler&#8217;s List is directly related to the Jewish religion and the attempt by Hitler and his Nazi party to exterminate the Jewish people and their religion. The holocaust was a terrible event but not a first in the long history of not only Jewish persecution but religious wars that date back to biblical times. Since the Holocaust the Jewish people have established a day of remembrance called Yom Hashoah.	5.0	Schindlers list	2013-11-24	2	2	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AT07UZQQR7ZEH	"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov..."	"SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993, Universal) is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece and one of the most important motion pictures of all time.  Gorgeously crafted in every area and flawlessly acted, it won seven Oscars and got several more nominations for its distinguished cast.  (It also won Best Picture from seemingly every film critic group in the country.)  But this unforgettable true story of the Holocaust deserves more than Academy Awards; it deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for director/co-producer Spielberg.How on earth did such an incomparable work of art and shattering drama get made in mainstream corporate Hollywood?  A 196 minute B&W; downer with no big star names in its cast?  Maybe God willed it to be made--and made by a Jewish filmmaker with enormous power in Hollywood.  It tells the true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a womanizing and chain smoking Nazi and a self-centered war profiteer who saved some 1,100 Jews from death at Auschwitz and other concentration camps during World War Two.  Ralph Fiennes, a thousand miles away from QUIZ SHOW and THE ENGLISH PATIENT, is a chilling death camp commandant who gets his kicks shooting Jews point blank at random.  And Ben Kingsley is amazing as Schindler's quiet Jewish bookkeeper, Itzhak Stern; I can't  believe this is the same actor who played Gandhi and Meyer Lansky in BUGSY.  It is beyond versatility.The source here is Thomas Keneally's novel, inspired by fact and adapted by Oscar winner Steven Zaillian.  Schindler has a munitions factory in Poland.  He saves hundreds of Jews from nearby Auschwitz (chilling location filming makes an indelible difference) by telling Nazi leaders that he needs the Jews to work in his factory making elegant items the Nazis can use and sell.  The movie has a genius conceit--a Nazi cheating the Nazis and saving countless Jews who really mean nothing to him.  What makes him do it, perhaps risking his own life in the process?  Neeson makes Schindler a fascinating and compelling enigma.SCHINDLER'S LIST is a very long movie and a very difficult one to watch at times with its Holocaust violence.  It runs three hours and 16 minutes, and Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn gives it all an engrossing and smooth pacing.  It may even improve in intimacy on home video at night, with the viewer stretched out on a bed with a bottle of water and the answer machine taking phone calls.  But my own Christian parents and a lot of Jewish (and Christian) friends have never been able to watch the movie.  They don't feel up to it, and in a way I can't blame them.  You can never again view the Holocaust in the same way after seeing this film, especially the scenes actually filmed at Auschwitz and in Krakow sewers with kids hiding.The film's look, by Oscar winner Janusz Kaminski, is exquisite--like no other B&W; movie I have ever seen, except maybe a German Fassbinder movie.  It has velvet blacks and creamy whites and shadows in the scenes with the Nazis, and  bleached-out white skies and fog in the death camps.  I may never forget the scene where nude women are inside the packed Auschwitz ""showers"", knowing they are about to be gassed--and instead really get streams of water.  Are the rumors about the camps not true?  The women, walking back to crowded barracks with robes on, look back and see smoke rising from night shower chimneys, mixed with fog in Kaminski's matchless use of black and white; the rumors are true and the women just got lucky that night.In a film that is 95% high gloss B&W;, the opening shot (with two candles on a dining table) and closing scene in modern Israel (with the surviving Schindler Jews putting stones on Oskar Schindler's grave) are in color.  But in the middle of the movie, watch Schindler on horseback on a hilltop watching a little girl walking in a hand-colored red coat through an otherwise B&W; town.  She will meet an unforgettably horrible fate, seemingly in the ovens.  But Spielberg doesn't feel up to shooting such a scene (who can blame him?) and instead just shows the red coat on a pile of Jewish clothes later in the film.SCHINDLER'S LIST is a movie masterpiece that has an devastating and indelible effect on a discriminating adult audience.  As the war ends, Schindler has to ironically go into hiding and bemoans the fact that he did not save more Jews.  You want to cry at the end, even with a tempered happy ending, for the six million human beings killed by the Nazis.  This truly great film is dedicated to their memory.  This is a dark and profound and very troubling movie, but do try to watch it in honor of the war dead, especially for Holocaust Awareness Day on April 15th.  Spielberg's movie should be shown in college history courses more than in movie theaters.  Who wants to watch this film in a suburban multiplex with a talky audience munching loudly on candy bars and slurping Cokes?Fortunately, it probably won't play in any multiplexes anymore fourteen years after its initial release.Home video seems ideal for SCHINDLER'S LIST because you maybe have a three-and-a-half hour time slot on a weekend evening, the movie all to yourself, a phone maybe unplugged, and a DVD/VCR pause button for bathroom and food breaks.  Treat this monumental film with that much respect.  The movie places Steven Spielberg in a pantheon for filmmakers who have made incomparable motion pictures that make a difference in the way we view world history in the 20th Century.  There can be no higher praise from me as a film scholar."	5.0	One of the most important films of all time	2007-04-15	8	6	2
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A25ZJ6XC4H1BJO	Stephen M. Zupan	After a long successful career of iconic films, Schindler's List was a radical departure for Steven Spielberg. You will not find any long effects-laden chase scenes, adolescent protagonists, or friendly aliens here. This film takes the viewer by the scruff of the neck, pries his eyes open, and forces him to stare into the abyss that was the Holocaust in a way that few people other than the ones who witnessed it could possibly know. Unlike in most films, the camera does not turn away as the cruelty that human beings can inflict on one another is played out in agonizing and personal detail.Well-deserving of the Oscars it won for Best Picture as well as Spielberg's first Best Director nod, this nonetheless is not a film to lightly just pick up and watch on a Saturday night. It is a journey; a fascinating and visceral ordeal of barbarism punctuated by moments of compassion, heroism, personal sacrifice and courage.

It was absolutely horrifying and amazing all at the same time. This movie had my emotions and mind running in overdrive. Spielberg shows an amazing display of creativity by giving a mostly black and white display of the horror history brought to the Jews. I honestly felt connected and disgusted as if the acts displayed were right in front of me. Liam Neeson is amazing in his character that you learn to love and hate simultaneously throughout the film. For instance he is a man that serves and works for the most horrifying leaders in history, the German Nazis. He is a womanizer, a racist, and war profiteer, abusive and powerful man in one respect right up until he decides to become a hero. It goes to show that through all of the hate, killings and heinous ruling  that the German leaders inflicted upon their people there were some that were strong enough and willed to fight for what was right. Based on a true story this film will have you turn your head on many terrible crimes committed by a man as he will sacrifice himself, his life and his resources to save the lives of 1100 Jews. Creating an emotional bond between the viewers, these Jews that you want so dearly to survive die to the sacrifice being made and for a man that is considered a Nazi. I know that there are many war movies and documentaries on the war, the holocaust and the horrifying experiences of the Jews but none are coming close to displaying the reality of the people than this movie. My all-time favorite part as I am sure for many is watching the horrible things the Germans had done backfire in their face as they fled away defeated. I will definitely watch it again maybe two or three times more in my life as I share it with others as it is an experience in its self.	5.0	Schindlers List the Reality	2012-12-10	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3OBBWCDNIYT8D	Stewart	Schindler's List is such an emotionally shattering and gripping movie that  no true words can even describe it. There are scenes in this movie that  will live in your memory forever. The performances from Liam Neeson, Ben  Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes are flawless. The soundtrack is also great,  with sad, classical music from the great John Williams and violinist Itzhak  Perlman. The last few scenes of this movie are so moving, inspirational,  and touching that you find yourself literally crying when Oskar Schindler  says to Itzhak Stern that he could have got more Jews out of the  concentration camps. When Schindler suddenly breaks down and cries, he is  so magnificent. I think that crying emotionally on-screen in movies is a  greater and better acting style than others. Liam Neeson can act in the  last scene he's in, and in general. He should have won the Oscar for  playing Oskar Schindler in this movie. Director Steven Spielberg really  created a true masterpiece with this movie. This movie should be shown in  every history class there is in high school.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A32PQHCSOO42QP	stormbringer	I would actually give &#34;Schindler's List&#34; four and a half stars out of five stars  as the story, (which may be repugnant to some people) is told very well, and the cinematography as well as the soundtrack, were also well done. .As  for the acting...EXCEPTIONAL... ALLTHE WAY AROUND...Although Liam Neeson is a favorite actor of mine, his breakdown into a blubbering &#34;little man or even child&#34; at the end is  the only detriment to the movie that I can see, I just can't see any &#34;German&#34; of the time,(no matter how remorseful for his, or her actions) to breakdown as Mr. Neeson did. Hence 41/2 stars not 5.	4.0	Schindler's List	2013-10-10	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AYKM1B74OLEVC	Story Charts	Schindler's List is about the idea that good triumphs over evil. Small gestures of kindness can overcome the inconvenient irks of everyday life, but absolute good must rise to the occasion to meet absolute evil, no matter the cost. In this story, there is no question about the absolute evil: the innocent victims of the Holocaust (the appeasement of which implicates us all, see The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich). In the backdrop of this absolute evil, our hero is not without guilt. He is a Nazi party member, an unabashed adulterer and war profiteer. But when history gives him the chance, he chooses to pursue an absolute good, the saving of a thousand innocent Jews from certain death. And this absolute good, pursued to the cost of his entire fortune, redeems him of all the other ills he had accumulated over his life.To give this idea life, the story's main plot is that of Schindler saving the Jews. To show the cost of this success, another plot tracks his fortune which is given up to save the Jews. Two other internal plots depict the morality of Schindler and Goeth. To make us experience the idea, absolute evil is given a face, a personality and a humane charm. The choices Goeth and Schindler make highlight the inner battles that must be won to strive for the absolute good.This story is so powerful, it's meaning so relevant, that its experience is almost beyond words. This is why movies should be made. Its special resonance comes from the fact that given the ideas of such absolutes, the hero and villain are not depicted as black and white. The same story could easily have veered to a didactic history lesson, instead it is a shared experience that makes the world a better place by reminding us of what the human species is capable of doing to itself.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.	5.0	Absolute good triumphs over absolute evil	2013-08-15	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2M1MNG7G40V85	Surface to Air Missle	"The importance of Schindler's List can never be understated as it is not just a movie but a message to society that unabashed good can come out of irrevocable evil.  Spielberg's homage to Mr. Schindler is so masterfully realized that is recognized in most circles as one of the greatest movies.  Unlike other ""best of all time"" movies, Schindler's List isn't subject to numerous repeated viewing as the power, emotion and subject matter provides the viewer with an intense and harrowing experience.Every aspect of the movie is a winner and the movie was an Oscar machine garnering winning 7 or so Oscars and claiming at least 11+ nominations.  Many recall 1993 as the most lopsided ""Best Picture"" Oscar race in the history of the show as enties like The Fugitive and The Piano couldn't hold a candle to this powerhouse.  Spielberg rightfully took best director as this movie showed that he was able to do more than excellent popcorn flicks.  Art Direction, Cinemetography, Editing and Muscial Score were among some of the other Oscars this movie won.The making of Schindler's List is a well known and interesting tale.  Spielberg has said that the making of the film was the most draining, emotional and wonderfull experience of his life.  The movie was filmed on location in numerous places in Europe and included numerous real life sets of very disturbing places and settings. Hopefully the DVD will include a ""making of feature"" as well as deleted scenes even though most Spielberg films don't inlcude unused scenes.Obviously this isn't a review of the DVD since it won't be out till March but here is what I do know.  There will be a regular 2-disc version and a limited edition gift set.  Both will probably include a widescreen and full frame version of the movie.  Apparently there are two featurettes already annouced and a Spielberg news site that there is more that is unannounced.  The gift set will include a coffe table book about pictures of the making of the movie, the soundtrack and a certificate of authenticity.  Apparently there are hours of great deleted scenes but there is no word on if they will be included.  Spielberg DOES NOT DO commentary and even though the importance of this film is overwhelming, rumor has is that he will stand by ""no coomentary"" attitude for Schindler's List.As a high school teacher I can tell you that there is a generation of students who haven't seen Schindler's List and thank goodness to Universal for finally releasing this DVD."	5.0	Shocking, moving, and untouchable.....	2003-12-19	7	5	2

The use of black and white was brilliant, it dated the time period and also dismissed any contentions that it was meant to be simply bloodthirsty. Showing the gruesome scene where  the ghetto was attacked was necessary to help explain what triggered  Schindler to find sympathy for the people. Apparently the bit about the red  coat was an actual survivor's memory of his daughter.  This was truth,  sorry if the script didn't tickle or seduce. It was a deadly serious  masterpiece!!  Not 100% of Germans were bad, nor 100% Jews were good, but  we are watching human nature at work, and I'm thankful that Speilberg came  up with such a brilliant ending!!! The first time (in the theatre) I didn't  realise that some of the people coming over the hill were actual Schindler  survivors, not just the cast until halfway through, but I cried and still  cry whenever I replay that scene. He ends it by giving us hope.As to the  comments about violence and also the violence in Private Ryan, this is life  portrayed with incredible realism, folks. Speilberg doesn't deal in  gratuitus violence, and the most violent scene I've ever seen him film was  the dumping of slaves off the Amistad, that really haunted me with no drop  of blood in sight!! If you can't stomach realism, watch Disney instead.	5.0	Realism is Speilberg's forte!!! 10 STARS!!	1999-06-29	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AGI4BO7O3OKYD	Tanya Nelson	Schindler's List is a black and white movie based on a true story about the horror of the Holocaust. Schindler a businessman from Poland started a company making dishes and cookware. Schindler also brings in a partner/accountant named Itzhak to help him with his new business. Schindler then staffed his plant with Jews who were unpaid, so he had a fully staffed business with free workers. The Jews he brought in to work for him were the same Jews that had been forced into Krakow's Ghetto by Nazi Troops. However some Jews did not mind working for Schindler because they felt this could prolong their life for atleast another day. When the Jews were forced in Krakow's ghetto, many of them were killed, men, women, and children, it did not matter to the Nazi troops. By 1942 all of Krakow's Jews were in the Plascow Forced Labor Camp, which was led by Amon. Amon was a horrible person who would get drunk and randomly shoot the Jews that were working, from the balcony coming off of his bedroom. Schindler continues to use Jews in his plant and continues to request more and more Jews, as he finally came to senses that what is going on is wrong. He kept requesting Jews in an effort to save as many Jews as he could from the Nazi Troops and from Amon. Schindler ended up saving over one thousand Jews but in return lost his whole empire and business.This movie is related to my world religions class right now because we are learning about the history, rituals and modern times of the Jewish, and unfortunately the Holocaust is an important part of Jewish history.	5.0	Schindlers List	2013-03-22	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ABLGY9W6CB1HZ	taylor williams	Schindler&#8217;s List is a movie about a German businessman that saved the lives of many people during the Holocaust. He did this by giving them jobs and hiding them in his factories. Although the movie is black and white, it is actually more of a recent movie being filmed in 1993 and it starts a very popular actor, Liam Neeson. The movie begins in 1939 as Polish Jews are being transported to the Ghetto. It was the beginning of World War II. Schindler, who was at first in the Nazi Army opens a factory that produces enamelware. Itzhak Stern, a Jewish official helps him due to his connections within the business and Schindler maintains a relationship with the Nazis as his wealth begins to grow. He hires Jewish workers because the cost of pay is much lower, in turn this saves the Jews from being sent to concentration camps and eventually being killed. The second lieutenant in the SS, Goeth, arrives to oversee the construction of a new concentration camp and once the camp is complete he ordered that the Ghetto be destroyed. Most of the people are then shot and killed, and Schindler is a witness. This deeply affects him as he felt connected with a little girl in a red coat, which was one of the few colors through the black and white film; she was hiding from the Nazis. Later, he sees the same red coat on a wagon full of bodies being taken away. Maintaining his friendship with Goeth was difficult for Schindler because of the horrible things he did like mistreat people and shoot them off of his balcony. Schindler is now worried about saving lives through his factories rather than how much money he can make. Goeth is then ordered to ship remaining Jews to Auschwitz. Schindler then creates a list, &#8220;Schindler&#8217;s List&#8221; of names of people to be sent a new factory in his home town, Brinnlitz rather than to Auschwitz. Schindler discovers that one of the trains of women being sent to the factory is redirected to the concentration camp, so he jumps into action by bribing the commander of Auschwitz with a bag of diamonds. SS guards aren&#8217;t allowed to enter production rooms to hide the fact that Schindler is saving Jews by allowing them to work there. He keeps bribing the Nazis in order to save the Jews and employs them which causes him to run out of money around the time that the war began to end. Schindler then flees in order to avoid the Red Army after persuading the SS guards to not kill the Jews. The next day the Jews wake up in the factory and are told they are free to go, they have been liberated. The last few scenes show the execution of Goeth and the grave of Schindler&#8217;s grave in Jerusalem. In the very last scene, Liam Neeson, the actor who played Schindler, places roses on his grave.This movie relates to World Religions because we learned about Judaism and the horrible things that happened to them during World War II as well as the few and far in between that helped the Jews during that time. It gives a first look at how harsh the conditions were of the Holocaust and the horrible things that happened. Because this movie was a mainstream English speaking film, the term Holocaust was used although we learned through our book that Jewish people actually prefer the term Shoah which means literally &#8220;whirlwind&#8221;. They prefer this because the term Holocaust means a &#8220;burnt-offering&#8221; which is a literal word due to the ways of the mass killings.	4.0	Good movie- Posting for a class assignment	2014-04-13	2	2	0

It helped bring Liam Neeson's career into the international spotlight. It also helped launch Ralph Finnes' career. Stephen Spielberg refused to accept any money for this film, thinking it would be 'blood money'.The film's portrayal of the Holocaust was also downplayed in order to make it more suitable for a larger audience. The Holocaust was MUCH worse than this film makes it seem. The John Williams score is also very memorable. One interesting note is that early in the film when Schindler goes to the party, you can hear the song, ""Por Una Cabeza"" made popular by the film ""Scent of a Woman""For many of the supporting cast members, this is still their first American film to date.One of the most memorable scenes was the prologue when the acutal people portrayed in the film and the actors portraying them, visited Oskar Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. Also in that scene Liam Neeson puts flowers on Schindler's grave, though it is often mistakenly thought that Stephen Spielberg was the one doing that.Overall this is an excellent but depressing film and I hope the DVD version will be loaded with extra features."	5.0	It's about time they release this on DVD	2003-12-08	24	20	4

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3LY48PLYZQEBB	Terrie L. Yow	Schindler's List effectively captures on film, the depiction of one of the most horrific and unconscionable events of all time - the Holocaust. Even through one of the darkest eras in human history, there are those who lifted their hands in quiet, skillful defiance and offered a glimmer of hope and pockets of goodness that continue to reverberate from generation to generation. Oskar Schindler was one of those people.Based on a true story and shot entirely in black and white, Stephen Spielberg shows his brilliance in directing this dark and moving classic starring Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, and Caroline Goodall.The story begins with Oskar Schindler, a penniless Nazi, and his dream of making a fortune from cheap labor found in the Ghetto - a place where Polish Jews were exiled by Nazi Germany. There they were placed into poverty after being ripped from their homes and stripped of their possessions.As time goes by, Oskar Schindler begins to see a different side of things and finds himself deeply affected by the unjust torment and murderous acts carried out against these innocent people. Incrementally and progressively, he steps out onto a path to save as many people as he can, but must find a way to avoid the cruel and unforgiving transgressions of the German army, else death will come to him as well.Judaism is the central religion of the Jewish people. It is derived from Hebrew beliefs and practices set forth in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), also known to many Christians as the Old Testament. Their ancestry stems from the tribes of the Children of Israel. Being one of the oldest surviving monotheistic (one God) religions, Judaism considers divine covenants as their foundation. With a covenant being a contract between the Jewish people and God, many felt betrayed and abandoned during the Holocaust.This film is equally inspiring and disturbing. Spielberg has accomplished another masterpiece and forever etched the tragic images into our minds, lest we shall never forget, and nor should we. This movie is highly recommended and should be viewed by all mature audiences everywhere. With great confidence, I can easily say Schindler's List is the best movie I hope to never see again.	5.0	Schindler's List	2009-11-01	2	2	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2J00K3J9KPQD3	The Dread Pirate Pastor Muppets	"It is said in the Talmud, the central text for Judaic law and ethics, that whoever saves one life saves the world entire. That is certainly true of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who defied the Nazis to save the lives of 1,200 Jews. But as ""Schindler's List"" tells us, he was not always morally compassionate for the Jews.Schindler saw putting Jews to work in his factory as more of a ""Well, I can't make money any other way. But I can protect them from Hitler."" He wore a swastika on his jacket only to gain respect and profits from the Nazi party. You can say that by wearing a swastika and receiving benefits from the Nazis, Schindler was himself a Nazi. But it also comes down to the fact that he didn't bring harm to the Jews. Steven Spielberg, the director of ""Schindler's List"", has said that Schindler was less of a Nazi in his heart. He was just a greedy businessman who saw the Jews as a way to make money, and only later did he come to care for the Jews.I'm sure that most people back in 1993 were shocked that Spielberg made this movie with the amount of violence that it shows and offers. In previous pictures such as ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"", Spielberg cut the Nazis down into treasure hunters and less of what they really were. But in ""Schindler's List"", he shows us the true meaning of a Nazi. Most of them were faceless soldiers who mercilessly massacred not just Jews, but millions of other innocent human beings. Now why I do say most? Weren't all the Nazis savage animals?History has showed us time and time again that within a large army of animalistic humans, there is always at least one person who knows what's right. Schindler was that morally incorruptible being. Spielberg shows us that his turning point in the film is the liquidation of the Krakow Ghetto, where he witnesses on horseback the gathering up of Jews to be sent away to the Nazi death camps. He begins to feel compassion for people who could not defend themselves, and he knew what he had to do.It is Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler that was most satisfying about the character. Schindler had already been adapted for the screen incredibly well, and Neeson was the human link that made the performance great, if not brilliant.The Nazis, particularly Amon Goeth (in a remarkable performance by Ralph Fiennes), were selfish, malevolent beings who sought world conquest and the destruction of people who were different. Spielberg shows us that they loved murdering innocent people. They got great pleasure in doing it. If it had been any other way, ""Schindler's List"" would have been an example of a Holocaust parody.One notable performance that is consistently overlooked is by Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant whom Schindler recruits to be his right hand man. Stern criticizes Schindler at multiple moments in the film. He believes that some of Schindler's tactics are not successful in rescuing human beings. At other times, he praises Schindler for being incorruptible and willing to risk his own life to save hundreds of others.Another key element of ""Schindler's List"" is the violence of the picture. Spielberg doesn't turn the violence and hatred into things of fantasy. He shows people being shot in the back of the head, being incinerated, and being lead to what seems to be the gas chambers (water comes out miraculously instead of gas). As I stated before, the Nazis took great pleasure in killing Jews.I saw the film again today for the second time in my life, and this time around I remembered why I love this film so much. Seeing it again, I examined ""Schindler's List"" as a film that preserves history. Spielberg brings together all of his resources and all the ""Schindler Jews"" that he could to get the story straight and accurate. If he had followed a path that lead to generic melodrama, it would have been extremely offensive. (But he obviously knew that.)At the end of the movie, we are shown the second shots of color (the first being the very beginning of the film with a family celebrating the Sabbath) as we see the ""Schindler Jews"" in present-day place rocks on Schindler's grave. We see each of their names as they place the rocks on the grave. The last shot of the movie is of Liam Neeson standing over Schindler's grave. It's a powerful sight.But examining ""Schindler's List"" for the second time, I began to think about the detractors of the movie. Claude Lanzmann, the director of the 9  hour documentary ""Shoah"", called ""Schindler's List"" a kitschy melodrama and a deformation of the truth, as he wanted to be the only voice in the true account of the Holocaust. The claim he made is extraordinarily inappropriate and offensive. Anyone who wants to show the Holocaust truthfully should be allowed to, and Spielberg pulled it off.Stanley Kubrick has said that ""the Holocaust was about 6 million Jews who got killed. ""Schindler's List"" is about 600 who don't."" In truth, ""Schindler's List"" uses the Holocaust as a basis for the story. Roger Ebert has said that the film is about character studies, in terms of Oskar Schindler and Amon Goeth, and he is right. If the film had been about the Holocaust, I don't think that Schindler's name would have even been brought up. As much as I admire the films of Stanley Kubrick, I must say that he was flat-out wrong in terms of ""Schindler's List.""So what is the movie about? If I were asked to answer that question, I would say that ""Schindler's List"" is about defying the greatest of all evil in the greatest of all perils. It is not about the Holocaust. It is one man's story, and continues to be.As far as the movie goes, ""Schindler's List"" is absolute good. When Itzhak Stern said that the list is life, the same can be said for the film. ""Schindler's List"" is life."	5.0	Great Movies- Schindler's List (1993)	2012-06-27	0	0	0

The first: by telling this story through the amoral Oskar Schindler, a German profiteer, Spielberg delves into the complexities of evil, especially in the scenes between Schindler and the frightening camp commandant, Goerthe (played with chilling precision by Ralph Fiennes).  The black and white photography, everything--it all works.Many moments still come to mind: the little girl in the red coat, the documentary look and feel of the gunshots, the dreadful looks of realization on the faces of people as ashes snow down on them, the haunting final scenes.The refrain of the survivors has been, ""Never Again.""  The lasting impact of Spielberg's film will be, ""Never Forget."""	5.0	A Shattering, Lasting Cinematic Experience	2003-12-23	8	6	2

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2M36DQEA6TET	theresa lopez	Before starting this movie I initially thought it was going to be hard to get in to because I don&#8217;t normally like movies that are a representation of history.  However, this was a very intriguing portrayal of the Holocaust.  I believe this was depiction of the horrific event, to the effect that viewers in a sense can feel as if they were there and grasp a greater sense of empathy with the Jews back then, just as in the movie &#8220;Passion of the Christ&#8221; where it relives the death of Jesus.  I didn&#8217;t think that Schindler would&#8217;ve helped like he did based off his interactions to the Jews when they first got transported out of their home lands.  I feel this movie  added sense of how far hatred and racism can go. As far as Jews,  even though modern Jews didn&#8217;t have to face that, their ancestors did and it can join together and bring about unity and recognize freedom that they have.  Not only Jews, but also Americans and not take that for granted.  It&#8217;s a good representation and not something should be forgotten, but at the same time I feel that remembering certain events can also trigger an ongoing feeling of anger and resentment.  It to me, also shows how the balance of government is important.	4.0	Schindler's List	2014-04-13	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A26JW6X5OBSS7C	Thomas Aurelius	"This film is very difficult to watch, and stays with you long after its finish.  The public executions by Amon Goeth were exceptionally brutal and barbarous, as was the killing spree of his sadistic comrades at the concentration camps and the ghettos.  Oskar Schindler, first blind to the inhumanity taking place around him, subsidizes the freedom of his Jews (Schindlerjuden) and removes them to a factory with a diminishing Nazi influence.There is only was negative comment I have to make of this movie:  Spielberg focuses the holocaust murders on just the Jews.  But not only were the Nazis impassioned anti-Semites, the massacre extended to Sinti, Roma, prisoners of war, mentally and physically disabled, homosexuals, Africans, Catholic and Protestant clergy, Jehovah's Witnesses, trade unionist, Freemasons, and Eastern Christians.  The estimates of murdered ""undesirables"" at the hands of the Nazis is between 9 to 11 million if the omitted groups mentioned above are included.  I am aware that this film is about the waking of Oskar Schindler and the rescue of his immediate workers, but briefly mentioning a few of those omitted would have been appropriate."	5.0	Difficult to watch; rips your heart out	2006-12-21	2	2	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A30OXD42ZFYZLO	Thomas Keneally	"Steven Spielberg has made many good movies but badly wanted a great movie to his credit. The Holocaust is a topic that has its unique and riveting moments. While many movies have tried to capture it, few have come close to reality due to multiple reasons, the brutality, how much to show, collective guilt concept etc. The book written by Thomas Keneally was outstanding and must be read by anyone interested in this topic, it is fiction based on truth and gripping. The movie is beautiful in many ways, it captures some of the harshness and terror of the times but it failes to show who Oscar Schindler was. The book shows how he was as a person right from his childhood to his late life. He had a father who was not faithful to his mother and was resentful of that, but everyone in his family except him knew of how much he was exactly what he hated, a mean, petty, womanizing person.There are parts in the book that are more brutal than the movie. I do not think that Spielberg did a good job of understanding the story. There is a part where the Nazi surround the oldest synagogue in Krakow, get the Jews to spit on the scroll. All the orthodox people accept the order but one person who was not religious says to himself, ""I have not been true to my religion, but I will not do this."" and refuses to follow the order. The Nazis gun him down and all the others too and burn down the synagogue. Instead of this scene, the movie had one of someone escaping with a chicken and a kid pointing to a dead person and saying ""Him"", which was silly.When Schindler failed in his farm in South America, he tried to live in Germany but was hated there and was called a ""Jew kisser."" However, he was treated like a benevolent father in Israel. Whenever he went to Israel he ate at a Romanian restaurant of one of his children who made sure that he did not drink too much. When he died, he was buried in the protestant cemetary in Jerusalem, which is a joke as he was one of the least religious people. While the book brought out both the Holocaust and the human part of Oscar Schindler, the movie did a shoddy job of it. When I first saw the movie, I loved it. However, after I read the book my enthusiasm for the movie diminished substantially. I would still say that the movie is very good as it brought to light a person who would have been unknown to me but would recommend all to read the book. It is one of the best books written in the last twenty years in the literary sense. The movie is well acted and photographed, but not well scripted. The story could have been put together better. There was too much polarization - all Germans are bad, all others are good. While being Jewish myself, I recently saw a documentary of two Czeck Jews who escaped from a concentration camp and told that one of the SS guards told that he hated his job so much that he would rather be transfered to a job in Eastern Europe, which would mean certain death. I understand that this is a movie and it requires a degree of fictionization, but parts of it are historically incorrect and could offend people. Despite this deficiencies, it is a start for great movies such as ""Life is Beautiful"" and ""Pianist"". However, I do not think that it deserves the rank in AFI top 20 that it got."	4.0	Decent movie, the book is much better	2005-07-26	8	4	4

He wanted his business to generate more revenue and felt his connections to Nazi Germany would allow him to get more money by convincing Jewish people to invest in his company. Schindler was very excited about the many possibilities the war would help him become rich during all the changes economically. He realized that he wasn't capable of keeping his financial books and managing a company of a large magnitude, therefore he hired a Jewish man named Stern, to help him in those areas. He was adamant about getting into the exchange of goods because money was worthless in the ghetto at this point in the war. His plans would make him rich beyond desire. Stern understood that in time hiring Jewish people to work in the factory would help ensure them from being killed or sent off to concentration camps. Schindler doesn't know that Stern has used this factory as a safe haven to protect his people. Later he doesn't realize what is going on after Stern bring a man to him that wanted to thank him for helping save his life. Schindler's breaking point was when a little girl came to beg her parents to be employed at this factory, he pays off Geoth to allow him to build his own sub camp for Jews to live. He ended up going bankrupt by helping keep several Jews from being sent to concentration camps. At the end of the movie, the Jews are freed but Schindler will now be hunted as a criminal for safe housing Jews.	5.0	World Religion Schindler's List Review	2012-11-04	0	0	0

Spielberg's masterfully told tale of how German Oskar Schindler saved Jews from the concentration camps by employing them in his bogus crockery and munitions factory is moving, stirring, and any other superlative adjective you can think of.  Although brutally graphic at times, the film accurately portrays both Jewish passivity and Nazi aggression and leaves the viewer with more questions than answers about how the world could stand idly by while the Holocaust happened.The thing I enjoyed most about the film was the subtext of power and the juxtaposition of Neeson's Schindler against Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goethe. Both men use their power to very different ends, and there are some classic cinematic moments when Neeson explains the nature of power to Fiennes.I often used segments of the film during my public speaking classes to demonstrate the point that rhetoric is a tool that can be used for good or evil.  There are examples in the film of both--Goethe using the power of communication for evil, and Schindler using it for good.The film, of course, won Best Picture in 1993, and who couild blame the Academy.  Schindler's list left an indelible mark on the minds of many, and that was precisely Speilberg's point.  As the sign outside of Auschwitz reads, ""never forget.""  Thankfully, this iconic film is now on DVD for us to watch again and again and keep the memory of the Holocaust alive for future generations."	5.0	Glad To See this Masterwork Finally on DVD	2004-03-10	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2HSDL11EBGIYM	Tina	"Shindler's List begins in 1939 Poland during World War 2, when the Germans had just overtaken the Polish army and taken control.  Under Hitler's command the Jew's were being blamed for all of the worlds troubles and were made to leave their homes, leave their belonging s and move into ""ghetto's"" to serve as labor forces. Oskar Schindler was a catholic man who was in Poland to try to make money.  He came up with the bright idea to begin a manufacturing business and use Jews to do the labor, because they would come so cheap.  He begins by hiring a Jewish accountant, Izthak Stern, to help him run the business and get some Jewish backers prior to their removal to the ""ghetto"".  Schindler's motive was not to save Jews, but to make a lot of money. But through the influence of Stern and seeing the horror going on around him he came to care for the Jews and want to help when he could.  He used his good standing as a member of the Nazi party and his connections with the German army to pull this off. He had also amassed a small fortune from his venture, that would turn out to be very valuable resource for keeping the Jews safe in the future. After some time the Jews were removed from the ghettos and transported to concentration camps to work as their labor force.  They were separated from their belongings and their families and the men and women were separated.  Mr. Shindler was allowed to set up his manufacturing plant within the camp to keep the workers he had safe.  When the time came that Hitler had passed down the order to dismantle the concentration camps and send all of the prisoners to Auschwitz Germany where many were being put to death in gas chambers.  He bribed German officials with the fortune he had amassed and was able to transport 1,000 Jews to his hometown to work in his factory to save them from certain death.This movie relates to world religion in that it is a very honest depiction of the Holocaust, which was not only a huge part of Jewish history and culture, but also a huge part of our worlds history.  It also touches on the principles of love and compassion, which is an integral part in many of our world's religions."	5.0	Schindlers List in World Religion	2012-11-17	0	0	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A17ZGLGI1XT12B	Tmcarver	"In the film ""Schindler's List"" Oskar Schindler, a German entrepreneur, hires Jews as cheap labor to work in his new factory in Czechoslovakia. Over time he becomes something a lot like a savior of the Jews. He goes from a money hungry business man to the savior of over 1000 Jews from the gas chamber during the Holocaust. The cold SS Captain, Amon Goeth one of the main people Schindler bribes is sent to Czechoslovakia where he is asked to build a labor camp. He is stationed at a camp as its commandant. Through out the film there seems to be a mutual friendship between Amon Goeth and Oskar Schindler. During a party Oskar Schindler confronts Amon Goeth's Jewish maid. He then finds out that she has been abused by Amon Goeth, provoking what appears to be compassion from the businessman Schindler. When the order comes down to ship all Jews in the area to Auschwitz Schindler can't help but to want to save his workers. Through a series of bribes to many different key members of the Nazi party He is able to move ""his workers"" to his home town. When the war ends Schindler has to flee his own home but before he does his Jewish workers give him a ring and a letter explaining how they felt about him and the love they had for him. When he died he was placed in a Jewish graveyard. There the Jewish survivors, whom he had hired and essentially saved, visited his grave. The ending scene is of his spirit in the graveyard.I believe this movie brought a new level of respect to the Jewish community from outsiders as well as a respect of other religions people don't really know about. I know after I watched it I felt a deep sorrow for the whole Jewish community. The loss and torture these people endured should never be put upon anyone. The impact of the Holocaust is still felt today by many members of the Jewish community and that hurts me. I hope that past events and knowledge of other peoples beliefs can prevent this from happening again. I hope everyone will take the time to watch this movie."	5.0	Review for World Religion Class	2011-11-06	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1OOSR3VJMCGKC	Toby Pitt	"Truly a remarkable film but, being me, I just couldn't help catching something which I think, smugly I might admit, not an accurate portrayal of the event. When Itzhak Stern mentions to Shindler while they are producing the list that he is smoking half the cigarattes that Shindler smokes, the film seems to allude that Stern is concerned about the damage to his health he might receive from passive smoking. But the list was made I believe in 1944, and at that time the medical community was far from conclusive over the health damage tobacco might cause. In fact, even during the 1950s you will still see doctors endorse certain brands of tobacco and the medical community publish something like ""if excessive smoking actually plays a role in the production of lung cancer, it seems to be a minor one.""So I think there is no way Stern could have known ciggies were harmful little cancer sticks in 1944. I have said all this not the dismiss the movie, because I think Spielberg has done a marvellous job as usual, and Liam Neeson has played Oscar Shindler wonderfully, and I am glad to have watched this movie, along with the Pianist, which is another movie that is excellently done about the war, but from a different angle. Perhaps I just want to remind myself that movies, as brilliant as they could be, are limited, and something has gotta give to keep the plot going. In fact, I see this kind of thing in every movie, no matter how great it is, you name it."	5.0	Awesome, of course, but I caught something	2009-06-06	7	2	5
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A29YQZ8IQQT9FF	Todd Eanes	"Schindler's List is a rarity in contemporary filmmaking. It delivers a heart-wrenching story with Oscar-worthy performances, while demanding a soul-examining response from the viewer. How many movies can make that claim? And while not overtly addressing religious themes, the film leaves no doubt as to the answer to that age-old question: Does evil exist?Set against the backdrop of World War II Poland, and based on a true story, the movie follows the life of German businessman Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson). Always the entrepreneur, Schindler hatches a plan to start a factory and outfit it with cheap, Jewish slave labor. His idea, while bankrupt in one sense, was anything but in a financial sense as he becomes quite wealthy. Along the way, however, Schindler begins to question the brutality and depravity of the German captors overseeing the prison camp. Spurred on by a silent, inner awakening, he begins a campaign to personally see to the safety of ""his"" Jews, those who worked in the factory for him. Aided by his loyal accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), Oscar figures a way to ""buy"" all 1100 of the workers from the camp Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) and move them to safety. The plan ultimately is successful and the area is liberated by the Red Army soon after.It must be noted of the cast how moving and riveting the performances are from top to bottom, but particularly that of Neeson as Oscar Schindler. His portrayal is instantly believable on all levels, as you feel personally involved in the events that transpire. Never before have I sat in such rapt attention, waiting to see where he would take me next.One question that inevitably comes up amid any discussion of the Holocaust is that of where was God during this atrocity? How could He let so many of His people die? Among Jews in particular, the topic is especially sensitive. Some feel, such as survivor and noted author Eli Wiesel, that God abandoned the Jews, allowing the Holocaust in fact as some sort of punishment. Others though insist that God is still sovereign and that it is all part of his plan for the Jewish people.In any event, Schindler's List is a must-see film that deals with a depressing and horrifying subject in the best way possible. Having reservations about it before I watched it, I can honestly say that I am glad I saw it and am a better person for it."	5.0	Review of Schindler's List	2008-11-05	2	1	1

Its amazing to watch period, its well acted by everyone in the movie, and its so very sad to know that this is based on a true story.I cannot imagine enduring what some of those people went through, the terror of actually being at Auschwitz and surviving, watching loved ones shot down in cold blood for no other reason than being.

It makes us wonder what we would have done if we had been there.  It shows up the darkest parts of human capability.  That said, Schindler's List is NOT about the Holocaust.  It's about a greedy, instinct-driven Nazi, who becomes a true human being, only after having the truth forced down his throat again and again to the point that he can no longer deny it.  It's a simple, yet effective film, in which Speilberg mixes all his veteran cinematic skills, without being afraid to take independant risks (black &amp; white, girl with the red coat, etc...).  If you watched this film once, and were depressed by it, please watch it again.  It's a triumph of humanity for anyone who is willing to wade through darkness to see the light.  Granted, the Holocaust is an important part of the film, however in my opinion it's not the main theme, as evidenced by the fact that the hero is a Nazi and not a Jew (in film directed by Speilberg who is Jewish).  The film is more of a lesson, then an attempt at depicting the absolute truth of what happend, and for this Speilberg has taken some undue criticism.  Schindler's List is a wonderfully brave, and hopeful piece of cinema that should be appreciated by all.	5.0	A lesson for us all.	2000-10-28	1	0	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A31IYU6IEP3QNW	tomeka allen	The film &#34;Schindler's List&#34; (Steven Spielberg) is the based on the true story of a German businessman, Oskar Schindler who sees a way to make money during the Nazi&#8217;s rise to power, but becomes a humanitarian who saves the lives of Jews during the Holocaust(Shoah).  This remarkable movie depicts the horrific genocide of the Jews.Nazi, Oskar Schindler used Jewish labor to start a factory in Poland. At the beginning of World War II., Czech born Schindler started a company that produced pots and pans.  Schindler used flattery and bribes to gain military contracts.  Schindler brings in a Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern to run his factory that was started using money from Jewish investors.  Staffing the plant with Jews who were forced from their homes to live in Krakow&#8217;s ghetto, Schindler had a dependable, unpaid labor force.  For the Jews a job working in Schindler's  plant meant they would not die at the hands of the Nazis.  In 1942, all of the Jews in Krakow are assigned to the Plaszow Forced labor camp, where they were overseen by Commander Amon Goeth.  Goeth was an evil alcoholic who would use Jews for target practice.  Schindler makes arrangements with Goeth to continue to use Jews in his plant.  As Schindler sees the horrible way in which the Jews are treated, he gained a conscience.  Once the orders come down to close Plaszow, all the Jews are to be moved to Auschwitz.  At this point Schindler devices a plan to pay off Goeth in an effort to save the Jews that had been working in his factory along with the original investors and their families.  Schindler makes plans to take them to his hometown of Moravia to work in his factory there to produce shell casings for the military.  His wishes are granted.  Shindler and Stern develop a list of 1,100 Jews that will travel Moravia.  The train with the men and boys arrive safely at the factory, but the train with the women and girls is mistakenly rerouted to Auschwitz.  Hearing this news Schindler goes to Auschwitz and rescues the women and girls.  They eventually end up in Moravia with the male Jews.  At the factory in Moravia the guards are not allowed to gun down the Jews and cannot come on the factory floor without Schindler&#8217;s permission.  The Jews are allowed to celebrate the Sabbath.  As time goes on, Stern approaches Schindler to notify him that he is broke.  Schindler was not producing shell casings at the factory, instead he was buying them from somewhere else and passing them off.  The Moravian factory was in fact, a haven for the Jews.  At the end of the war, as the Jews gained there independence Schindler was forced to go on the run.  He tells the Jews they will be freed and he was a criminal and was forced to flee and leave them.  The film ends as the Jews give Schindler a gold ring and thank him for saving their lives.	5.0	A must See!!	2014-04-13	1	1	0

Rating it with 5 stars because I have already viewed a friends copy.Anyway, the issue of splitting the film across two sides is a no-brainer.  The compression required to accommodate a film of this size, with the soundtracks would be somewhat more disturbing than turning over the disk once during the entire movie.  When the next video format is released it will provide ample space for this type of movie, on one side of a disk, so we can all go to Amazon and order it again!Just enjoy the movie, there are bigger things to get upset about.	5.0	Great Movie - Big Price Drop	2004-04-02	7	4	3
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2J0VNTQTQO4R4	ToonForever	"Despite being an avid viewer of quality movies, I have one habit that sometimes prevents me from seeing a movie when everyone else is.I don't like blood.Blood kept me from seeing most horror films, which doesn't bother me so much.  It kept me from seeing Pulp Fiction for six years, Reservoir Dogs for longer than that.  I still haven't seen Saving Private Ryan, and before yesterday, I still hadn't seen this film.In the afterglow of such a viewing experience I find it very difficult to give a review like I would a ""normal"" movie.Schindler's List is not a normal movie. It goes without saying that it is a very important movie.To take that thought a step further, there are two types of important movies. The first is a movie that is seminal in style and content, that defines a genre or phase in moviemaking; The Maltese Falcon for American Film Noir, Star Wars for the Epic Blockbuster, Nosferatu or perhaps Dracula for Horror, Metropolis or 2001: A Space Odyssey for Science Fiction, King Kong for Monster Movies, Singin' in the Rain for the Movie Musical, Birth of a Nation for silent films, The Godfather for Gangster dramas, and Citizen Kane for, well, for movies in general. These are important films for people to see who wish to understand film, entertainment, etc.Schindler's List is the other sort of ""important."" It's not just important for people who appreciate film to see (although it is masterfully crafted, which I'll get into in a moment.) It is important for people who are human.Everyone who isn't a psycho-hatebag (i.e.: President Ahmadinejad) knows that the ""Shoah"" (lit. calamity) or ""Holocaust"" was possibly the most horrific event in human history, matched only rarely by the likes of Stalin and Pol Pot. Yet many people can only discuss this topic in the most basic terms. Six Million Jews, Adolf Hitler, Final Solution, Auschwitz, etc. How can any of us put a personal face on such an unimaginable tragedy? How can we ever get into the heart of the suffering and pain?Truth is we never can. But Director Steven Spielberg gets us as close as we can possibly hope to get.Spielberg shot the movie in black and white, a masterful choice that accomplishes two things. First, it sets the movie into the period. When we see black and white, we automatically are in the 40's. This is the color of our World War II footage, even of most of the still pictures we see. It places us in the moment.The second thing it does is make it watchable. If it had been in color, I wonder how many of us could have watched to the end. Spielberg doesn't go with the cutaways when innocent Jews are executed by a shot to the head at close range. He shows it to you. I have seen one video of a man shot in the head in my lifetime. I wish I'd never seen it, but there was no difference, other than the color, to this.In any other movie, it would have been gratuitous. But this is what the Jews saw as they went about their daily life.  Spielberg lets you see a life of horror through their eyes.In one scene an old one-armed man who had been protected by Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), Oskar Schindler's (Liam Neeson) Jewish plant manager, is caught on the way to the factory when the group of workers is forced to shovel snow to clear the road for German vehicles. He is taken aside and executed summarily. Graphically.Yet the true horror of the scene was the mother and child nearby. As the man is dragged aside, the mother urges her child, ""Look at the snow, look at the snow, the snow!"" The child looks down (though we don't.) There is a crack of a handgun and the man goes down, his blood soaking the snow, but the rest keep shoveling, hoping to just survive the moment. Looking at the snow.Spielberg demonstrated in this movie not only that he can make a movie look good, but that he can make a movie of power and truth.Ralph Fiennes plays the sadistic Amon Goeth, the German officer in command of the labor camp supplying Schindler's factory with labor. To say this man was murderous would be an understatement. Yet even here Spielberg manages to show the conflicted humanity of the man. His inner conflict concerning his Jewish Maid Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) is subtle and heartbreaking, as you tug on him with your own mind to find his humanity somewhere within.Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern is, well, Kingsley. He is quite possibly the most skilled and adaptable actor in the world, despite not being the first name to come to mind when you think of great modern actors. Disclaimer: I'm a big fan. He plays Stern with stark honesty. Stern is very realistic, and does not expect to live out the war. He is fatalistic and insecure, and Schindler spends as much time saving Stern from himself as from the Nazis.But the star is the star, right? Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler is a masterwork, a lifetime achievement. His collaboration on this part with Spielberg (and writer Steven Zaillan) brings out Oskar Schindler as a tangible, three-dimensional person. Schindler is the stuff real heroes are made of, though he eschewed the moniker all his life. Movie heroes are idealistic, other-motivated, sacrificial from birth caricatures. Schindler is a selfish, womanizing, profiteering opportunist who finds he cares about these people he first employs as slaves. In the beginning this practice of protecting seemed to be instigated by Stern, with Schindler purposely turning a blind eye, but there was in him a sense of humanity that could not buy into the Nazi propaganda regarding the so-called inhumanity of Jews. Neeson portrays the gradual, stilted journey from self-service to self-sacrifice with marvelous aplomb.This film is full of moments, moments that make you cry with horror and make you cry with quiet, joyful hope.But nothing can prepare you for what happens at the end. If you have never seen this movie, you will find yourself moved to the depths of your being if you have any soul at all.  I will not give it away for the few that may  not have seen it yet.It is almost moot to give this movie a rating. Five Stars, Five anythings makes no sense. This is one of the most important films ever made, and should be required viewing for those who are committed to facing the evil in our world that still perpetrates killing, in Darfur, in Rwanda, wherever it may happen.I only regret having waited so long and for so silly a reason."	5.0	One of the Most Important Films Ever Made	2007-03-12	21	14	7

Pometta ""Classic Movie Lvr"""	Based on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (filmed in black and white) stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory and staffing it with Jewish workers, this helps to keep as many people as possible from going to concentration camps as the Nazis order every Jew to be killed or moves to Auschwitz. Schindler bribes the Nazi officials in order for his Jewish workers to escape a certain death. He compiles a list of skilled workers needed to run his factory.These workers are saved from a life of brutality or death.

Keneally book it was based on (an excellent read).  If it were out on DVD, I would already own it.  Like the book, the movie is not a story about Schindler nor about his list, but a story about grim reality and the human response in the face of inevitable disaster--clutching to every thread of hope at whatever cost...it's one of those films where you never expect to be even close to where you end up judging by the beginning.  Excellent choice of effects with the b/w and the girl in the pink/red dress, and the ending...I think that if the rest of the film had been in color, the impact of the film would have been significantly reduced, if not completely different.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3G6VEN1ZTKCPY	TucsonSusan	I first saw Schindler's List, which is a true story, when it came out and it was devastating then. I remember sitting in the theater for 3 hours and 11 minutes (it is a long movie) in stunned, shocked, tearless silence, and then bursting into tears when I walked out of the theater and realized that life was just moving right along. I watched the video to coach one of my writing students who was writing an essay on the film.This time I was crying openly, a lot more than the first time, in the privacy of my living room. You think you know about the Holocaust, and of course you do, but seeing it portrayed by Steven Spielberg is a life-altering experience. His skill with cinematography creates the feeling of actually being in Krakow, when the Jews were rounded up, and in the camps as their lives were changed forever, and not necessarily in a good way. Liam Neeson's portrayal of Oskar Schindler, a German manufacturer and member of the Nazi party (you had to be, to stay in business) was intelligent, amusing, and heartwarming. To see him transform from just a businessman looking for cheap (or, in this case, free, labor - you had to pay for Poles but not for Jews) to run his enamel works to a Righteous Gentile, who actively saved over 1,000 Jews, and lost every cent he had in the process, is brilliant. All of the acting is brilliant. The Nazis are portrayed in all their boorish indifference beautifully.Spielberg made this movie so that Holocaust deniers could see that the Shoah (Hebrew for &#34;catastrophe&#34;) actually happened. For me, there was never any doubt. And as a Jew, this movie is imperative, so that we &#34;never forget.&#34; Well worth the price of renting it.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A26UW8DNN74AGK	"""unhelpful"""	It would be silly of me to attempt to suggest that Schindler's List is anything but the most suprising masterpiece of Spielberg's career.  And yet, one tiny detail always makes me pause.  We're all familiar (or should be) with the magnificent D-Day scene from Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.  Only an ambitious filmmaker like Speilberg, always striving to out-do himself, could have conceived and executed such a superb seat-of-your-pants battle sequence.  It is by now the standard against which we will measure all future battle scenes.  And yet, it was maginificent precisely because it brought out the boy-wonder in Speilberg, the film-school student who knows every battle scene since The Birth of a Nation, and must find ways to surpass them.  In Schindler's List, the boy-wonder emerges, discreetly, in the myriad displays of Nazi murder.  &quot;Squibs&quot; are the tiny explosive devices attached to actors and scenery that simulate the impact of bullets.  Spielberg uses squibs so often, and with such obsessive detail, that it becomes slightly distracting.  Of course, a crucial part of Schindler's story is how he became humanized when faced with such Nazi brutalities.  Yet, if you begin to count the number and variety of Spielberg's squibs - from the machine-gun scoring of walls to the often explosive execution of innumerable Jews - you begin to feel the intrusion of the boy-wonder filmmaker, creator of Jaws and Indiana Jones, finding far too much pleasure in such technicalities.  Irresistibly, you begin to notice the actors with the lumpy scarves as the ones who will be shot in the head next. Or the ones with too much padding at the waist.  It is a tiny complaint, I admit.  But Schindler's List is generally so pure, so unswerving, that such obsessive details become distracting.	5.0	Great, but with one reservation	2000-09-28	0	0	0

One can easily describe it as the greatest of the Holocaust movies.Steven Spielberg's wonderful direction coupled with sterling performances from Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Raplh Fiennes leaves an indelible mark on the viewer.Oskar Schindler (Neeson) is an affluent German, who enjoys all the luxuries of life. But when he sees that a great war looms, he knows he can make big business out of it. He meets a Jew (Kingsley) and makes a deal with him... that he'll employ Jews in a variety of jobs. Out of nowhere the list grows to 4 figures, and Schindler knows that he has much to fight for.Despite the melodrama, the movie should be rated as one of the top 10 movies of all time.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A9SPSBOSXSV7C	W. Bailey	Steven Spielberg has captured in this film the story of a man who at first decided to capitalize on the misery around him during WWII and the German occupation of Poland.  Liam Neeson, as Oskar Schindler is perfect as the  womanizer, and neer-do-well.  He is unscrupulous in starting his new  business and yet discovers his own humanity, to the surprise of himself as  well as his friends and family.  He risks everything to save hundreds of  Jews that work in his factory from the death camps, when everyone else was  either complicit or turning a blind eye.  The story also captures the  essential elements of the Warsaw ghetto and how the final solution was put  into effect.  The part of the Camp Kommandant, is played with brilliance by  Ralph Fiennes...a drunk, a zealot, a coward, and ultimately a  monster...shooting people in the camp with a high powered rifle, simply for  the sport.  This film has been criticized, but it is the only film which  faces the Holocaust without turning away, or making some kind of lame  excuse.  The scene in the ghetto where the Jews are being rounded-up for  extermination, or shot on the spot, while one of the SS troops plays  Mozart, will stay with me for the rest of my life.	5.0	A Masterpeice...!	1999-11-10	1	1	0

Spielberg just CAN'T stop his hackneyed emotional manipulation, and I had to turn my face in embarrassment when Schindler starts weeping like a baby. UNBELIEVABLE. The black & white cinematography is superb. The recreation of the horrors then were quite convincing. You would think that given the subject matter, Spielberg would FINALLY relent and record a commentary track. But no such luck. His problem is that he can never ""get his story straight"", and thus would stumble with his multitude of contradictions. Want an example? Close Encounters. He, the DIRECTOR, gave differing accounts of how he got the little boy to react inside his house when he hears sounds at night. Look it up, you'll see."	3.0	GIVE ME A BREAK!	2004-11-11	31	4	27

Hey, my scratched up library rental copy played flawlessly on my $30 DVD player, so I can't relate to those reports. One reviewer said he would keep his laserdisc copy because at least his laserdisc player will switch sides without having to get up to flip the disc. Yes, but at a maximum of two hours capacity on one laserdisc, that reviewer will have to get up anyway to CHANGE his laserdisc to disc two in order to watch the remainder of the 3 hour 17 minute film! As far as the complaints concerning where the break point was chosen, I think one would be hard-pressed to find a point anywhere in this film where a break wouldn't upset the mood of the moment. Break points are something laserdisc fans had to endure for every film, and the break point chosen in this film isn't nearly as interruptive as some movies on laserdisc! Those who argue that a 3hr 17 minute film can be put on one side of a dual-layer disc are correct. But, a greater amount of compression would be required which would affect picture quality, since they already are also including not only Dolby Digital but DTS soundtrack.

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1FNVCCQD30BCB	William Lee	"Schindler's List is a movie about a German entrepreneur named Oskar Schindler who liberated over 1,100 Jews. The irony of the movie is that he was a member of the Nazi party and his factory, which employed Jewish workers, profited from the war. Oskar Schindler developed a conscience during the years and realized that the Jewish people were not the rodents or trash that the Germans believed them to be. Since Oskar had friends in ""high places"", he was able to provide immunity and prevent the killing of any of his Jewish factory workers. Although this Steven Spielberg directed movie is three hours and sixteen minutes long, the best part occurred at the end. With Oskar becoming broke from protecting his workers, America had announced the forced surrender of the Germans to the Allies. Oskar Schindler, realizing that he would be punished for war crimes because of his factory front, decided to flee the country with his wife. Just before he got into his car, he had a breakdown in front of all his factory workers and his accountant, who he grew very close to. He was upset with himself that he could not save more Jews while his accountant repeatedly told him that he had done more than anyone could ever imagine.This movie is about the horrors of the Holocaust and tells the story from the perspective of a German, who gradually develops a deep-found love for the Jewish people. While taking a world religions class this semester and watching this movie, I felt such remorse for the Jewish community. I ask myself, ""How could Jewish faith still be so strong after the murder and genocide of over six million Jews?"" Some Jews believe that faith in God will be rewarded and that the true followers of God will be asked to suffer more. They believe that God loves them and will always do what is best even if it's unfathomable to them. (Living Religions 266-268, 277-278)Although gruesome and cruel at times, Schindler's List is a brilliant portrayal of hope. Even though the movie is long, you will be glued to your television with each passing scene. Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes provided a star studded cast that helped win Schindler's List a plethora of Academy awards. This is a must watch movie, however, I must warn you, ""It's a tear-jerker!"""	5.0	Schindler's List	2011-03-27	0	0	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ARBJ6KB2932GF	willie pickens	By Amazon Customer: Schindler's List -Steven Spielberg wrote and produced this well-known history about enslaving Polish Jews during the soviet war; they lost their name and identity referred only by the list.  His production described how torture and guilt outweighed the need for greed and power.  The movie portrayed violence and prevailed fear for need to survive versus die a horrible death and love ones to live a miserable life of dreadful  existence in an unknown world.  Schindler&#8217;s List was produced as an incredible horrific occurrence that affected the world&#8217;s largest religion ever to be told, it did however reduce six million Jews from dying during the Holocaust.  The main character Oskar Schindler played an astounding role for his part as a high end German that concerned himself in the end by his own death that safety and respect of Jews and their traditions did matter.  He however used greed to gain a profit for powerful and control by slaving workers as a benefit to portray his culture as a &#8220;Nazi German.&#8221;  Ben Kingsley played the role, as Itzhak Stern Schindler&#8217;s assistant accountant was a fearful man who feared death from the Holocaust killing he was an obedient Jewish man that used skills and contacts to save the elderly, handicapped, and poor ghetto survivors from further torture.  In the end, he honored Schindler as a &#8220;God loving man that sacrifice his life for a good cause.&#8221;  In the movie, it was hard to understand the difference between Amon Goeth played by Ralph Fiennes and Schneider himself, at one point it appeared them as one person speaking in past tense of the story.  Goeth&#8217;s character was played as a mean selfish person who had no boundaries for hateful, disrespect, and control of Jews, his role was outstanding yet spiteful during the Holocaust.  I had a hard time watching the killing of children, woman, and the elderly just because he could.  I was also breathe taken by the Jewish losing their possessions to satisfy the German soldiers, to the point of having to eat jewelry so not to lose their belongings.  Overall, this movie was an astounding making of violence, torture, and survival of Jewish people who lived and survived the Holocaust.World ReligionThe movie Schindler List represented the torture and sacrifice whirlwind that captured images of self-hatred during World-War II against Jewish and Non-Jewish, it was seen as a reason to burn and kill for total extermination.  It expose mass murder killings of the Jewish community whom chose to disobey or had no purpose for the German soldiers, it was an insane way to explain reasons why Nazi&#8217;s could attain their actions and behavior for killing someone &#8220;Just because.&#8221;  The non-Jewish were spared no mercy from such torment; however, &#8220;The Rabbi&#8217;s Prayers and Sabbath days&#8221; continued held as a prayer to &#8220;God.&#8221;  The movie revealed that even in their darkest times the Jewish community never gave up their belief of &#8220;God&#8217;s Will and Divine love for him.&#8221;  It did not explain how the Jewish religion would mend a broken world under after the war, yet it describe in world religion that moral consciousness abides by a divine love in the midst of evil, and an understanding that God was present and continued to love all as one.  Still today, many Jewish people survive the Holocaust and live to tell about it.  Spielberg remade history of the untold story through the eyes of Judaism Religion that continue to worship, pray, and continue to belong since the Holocaust.	5.0	I love this movie it was an Amazing Movie	2014-04-13	1	1	0

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1COQ2DOO1O9HD	Wing J. Flanagan	"This film is worthy of great praise for many reasons, though I have called it ""almost great"", and I stand by that.  The film is vastly important - in spite of Steven Spielberg's nerve finally giving out in the last few minutes as he went for a dash of melodrama (Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler weeping about his not sacrificing his car or his Nazi pin to save ""just one more"").  It's a long reverberating gong at the end of an otherwise stirring piece of symphonic music.  What came before was so emotionally wrenching that it rendered the scene absolutely pointless. Though I'm certain this was not the intent, it actually seemed to me self-pitying.  Schindler, by that time, should have been way beyond such a state.  There was nothing left to do, dramatically speaking, but drive off in silence.Until that scene (a couple of small bits aside), Spielberg had resisted the temptation to ""dramatize"" and simply reported his story in an almost journalistic way, without flinching or stylizing it beyond the canny choice of shooting in black and white.  The burst of actorish speechifying served to jolt us out of the immersive sense of hyper-realism and remind us that it was, after all, a movie.But, in the larger context, that is a minor point.  What the film did successfully - and what nearly makes it a masterpiece - is vividly bring to life the most shameful event of the 20th century: the cold, systematic murder of six million people because of their ethnic and religious origin.  It's an obscenity that such a thing ever happened, and the film makes that so clear that - for literally days after I saw it - I could not get that number out of my head: six million.  The immensity of the Holocaust is almost unbearable, and if history books don't spell that out well enough, then films that tackle the subject need to.  Schindler's List does so - with great passion and skill.Some people have described the film as ""uplifting"".  That it tries to be is its other flaw.  Make no mistake: what the real Oskar Schindler did was an act of unalloyed heroism.  He deserves to be celebrated for that.  But no one should leave this film feeling good, because his heroism should never have been necessary.Kurt Vonnegut wrote a great novel, in part autobiographical, that  centered on the firebombing of Dresden.  While no one could sanely accuse him of sympathizing with the Nazis, his book ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" succeeds in telling us something that we should never forget: while the fires that consumed Dresden may have contributed to ending the war and saving many lives, and while it may have even been necessary to incenerate tens of thousands of women and children in the process, the act itself is no less horrifying and barbaric.  By the same token, the many acts of bravery and compassion on the part of military and civilian personnel alike (Schindler was not alone in saving lives), do nothing to mitigate the fact that World War II should never have happened in the first place.  By treating war - ANY war - as an opportunity to celebrate our redemptive qualities, we run the risk of romanticising our destructive, evil qualities as well.  To put it brutally, what Oskar Schindler did is what any human being should have done, anyway, given the circumstances.That more people did not is what we should really take from this film."	4.0	Deserves its praise, in spite of some flaws	2004-01-21	12	9	3

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1MPQOEDBUK8VG	"wonderrat ""wonderrat"""	Steven Spielberg has gotten a pretty bad rap for directing movies which catered to the mass populace.  There's nothing wrong with that, especially  if you can make scads of cash (and I wouldn't mind having ten percent of  Spielberg's gross).  In recent years, Spielberg has started making more  serious films in an effort to show that he can be taken seriously, and he  has suceeded brilliantly.  Of course, his first effort was 'The Color  Purple', which earned the dubious distinction of winning the Best Picture  Oscar without winning Best Director.  Whether Spielberg's Oscar for  Schindler's List was an attempt by the Academy to make amends can be  debated, but the film itself has Spielberg's trademarks: an epic with  fabulous cinematography and a compelling musical score.  And the story is  is like a novel with its twists and turns and engrossing plot, only it's a  true story.The story of Oskar Schindler is compelling: a Nazi  opportunist ingratiates himself into the hierarchy of German occupied  Poland and wins a contract to supply the German army with essential war  material.  Of course, Schindler's factory employs Jewish slave labor, but  that's besides the point for Schindler, as long as he makes a profit.  Schindler's turn from ardent Nazi to humanitarian who saves the lives of  his workers (those who are on his list of life) is the primary theme of the  story, but the outstanding acting performance is put in by Ralph Fiennes,  who portrays the sadistic Amon Goeth (and should have gotten an Oscar-he  steals the show from Liam Neeson in my opinion).  Historically, the real  Schindler acted probably out of less than honorable motives, perhaps acting  out of a sense of self-preservation and a feeling that some of the people  he saved could help him out in his later years, perpetuating an unfortunate  prejudice which still exists to some extent today.  The irony was that  Schindler died penniless and forgotten except by those people on the list  who owed their lives to himOne of the best scenes in the movie concerns  a train full of concentration camp inmates headed of to Auschwitz or any  one of the concentration camps.  Goeth and a group of officers are relaxing  on a hot summer day and the train is stopped at a siding.  The people in  the train are dying of thirst and heat prostration.  Schindler somehow  convinces some SS soldiers to spray the train with water hoses, giving the  people relief.  I forget the line, but Goeth remarks that Schindler is a  great sadist, for he has given people condemned to die a glimmer of hope.  A powerful scene and pure Spielberg.Some have criticized the movie for  being too long, but I think it flows pretty well and it is a delight to see  Amon Goeth get his just desserts, for despite the uniform, Goeth was no  soldier and represented no military tradition.  Of course the last couple  of scenes were a bit contrived, but all in all Spielberg does a good job  and this film may be more of a legacy than Jaws or ET.	4.0	Spielberg's Magnum Opus	2000-08-03	1	0	1

Parrish	&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is such an overwhelmingly divine,noble and heart-felt effort,and it deals with such a painful,shocking,sad,and unforgettable chapter in our(meaning the world's) shared history with such grace,accuracy,candor,and respect for the survivors,that I called it the &quot;most important film in history&quot; Truthfully,though,it almost transcends it's medium,into a rarified  place of it's own.It's very difficult to consider this film and,say,&quot;Little Nicky&quot; as being in the catagory(meaning film).Even the closest second to &quot;Schindler&quot; in terms of impact,quality,and subject matter,&quot;The Godfather Trilogy&quot;,pales in comparison,simply because the subject it's dealing with covers a much narrower segment of society;the Holocaust affected virtually everyone in the western hemisphere,and the scars are still,and will be,felt  by innumerable people.Steven Spielberg has accomplished something few have ever even attempted;he has made history accessible to everyone.Using his unparalleled clout and all the considerable resources he has at his disposal,he has captured forever the entire expereience of the Holocaust faithfully,and done justice to the unfathmable strength,dignity,pain,and humanity of it's survivors.Hopefully his efforts(for which,in my opinion,he deserves much more than an Academy Award;he deserves a Nobel Piece Prize) will ensure that no one will ever forget what happened--and,also ensure it is never repeated.	5.0	The Most Importanat Film In Cinema History	2001-03-02	1	1	0

But the movie becomes more than just a story about a Nazi, it is a miraculous tale of the Jewish workers he saved. Schindler is a businessman who seeks Jewish workers for his plan which involves opening a manufacturing plant. At the time, Jews were forced into working for the Germans for cheap or unpaid labor. Inorder for Schindler's plot to work, he must wheel and deal with Itzak Stern; a very intelligent Jew with ties to most of the Jewish community. Their partnership gains Schindler access to a large sum of money he needs to open the factory, which he borrows. By this time, the Jews have already been ordered to evacuate their homes, and shipped off by the masses (those who aren't blantently murdered). To the Germans, Jews were basically useful for anything, with the exception of labor. Males, females, families, and children were grouped together based on how ""useful"" they appeared. Individuals deemed too weak or feebil were usually exterminated; the ones who made the cut were forced to work for their persecutioner.For a period of time, Stern (Schindler's right-hand man), falsified documents in an effort to attain Jews who ultimately would have been slaughtered. Schindler ends up befriending the brutal man who runs the ""Ghetto""- one of the small confinements where the Jews were being transported. Subsequently, this ""friendship"" becomes beneficial and critical to Oscar and ""his"" Jews. The day arrives that the Ghetto must be cleared out and all Jews shipped to a concentration camp at Auschwitz; including Oscar's workers. Oscar uses his relationship with the Ghetto-runner to let him relocate his workers to another area. Being the vicious, money-hungry, savage he is, the Ghetto-operator gives Schindler the go ahead, in exchange for money. Schindler and his Jewish counterpart , Itzak, composes a list of all his workers. If their name was on the list, it exempted the Jew from being forced to relocate to Auschwitz. At one point, a train carrying some of his workers arrives at the wrong location- Auschwitz. Schindler, hearing of this, hurries to the city to rectify the problem. He bribes the manager of the concentration camp to let him have his workers back, as well as every other woman and child in the camp. With this accomplished, the people are boarded onto a train and sent back to Schindler's organization. Once they reach their destination, they must still work for him, but they are allowed to do be human once again.Schindler used his business skills and bribery to achieve everything he wanted. His Jews were saved from the Holocaust massacre. The people he saved make up but a tiny percentage of the world Jewish population at the time, but the fact that he cared enough to do so was the miracle. The last scenes of the movie show the actual grave of Schindler and a line of Jewish survivors leaving flowers. The Holocaust exterminated over six million Jews. Unimaginable acts were taken against them for no apparent reason except Hitler's insecurities. It is a fact that something could have been done to curve or even stop the Holocaust, had the world not just sat in silence. But, the past cannot be undone, and atleast something was done about it. It is beyond imagination what could have resulted if Hitler and his military had not been stopped. In present-day, debates arise about the actions that could have been taken to prevent such tragedies.Today the Holocaust still impacts the Jewish population. The overall impact of the massacre has caused many Jews to question the word of God. After all, the Jews being the chosen people should have received protection for being such devote followers of God. It caused the dispersion of the Jewish populations from their homelands and the loss of much of their genetic diversity. Exterminating that many people has devastating effects on physiology, biology, and mentality. In countries with Jewish populations, there is a new Holiday set aside for remembrance of the Holocaust. An entire minute of silence is offered, when all other on-goings are halted for the moment of silence. Depending on the family, feasts or celebrations may be held. Holocaust Memorial Day is set aside, not just for Jews, but the general population, so they may also pay their respects. Schindler's List was, and still is, one of the best movies ever made."	5.0	Schindler's List	2011-11-20	1	0	1
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"When watching a movie like ""Schindler's List"", there are so many ways that it can be appreciated.  It's a history lesson, an intense drama, and a gripping character study all at once.  For me, however, the film really hits home with the realization of the difference that one person can make in the grand scheme of things.For a basic plot summary, ""Schindler's List"" focuses on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a high-ranking member of the Nazi party during World War II.  When the German Nazis invade Poland and begin rounding up Jews into ghettos, Schindler sees it as strictly a business operation, opening up his own pots-and-pans factory using Jewish labor.  While raking in the dough on the backs of the Jews, however, Schindler begins to see the escalating brutality of the Nazis and is eventually appalled by their treatment at the concentration camps.  Thus, he creates a list of workers that he ultimately hopes to protect from the brutality.As a history-based epic, ""Schindler's List"" manages to capture the essence of the moment AND yet still be subtle about it at the same time.  Director Steven Spielberg strikes the perfect balance between drama and realism.  The acting performance from Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi Commandant is especially shocking for its ability to depict the brutality of those camps.  Essentially, this is a movie that should be shown to American high school students at least once during their education for its ability to show the true horrors of the holocaust.Perhaps the true hallmark of the movie, though, is the character evolution of Mr. Schindler.  He starts off as nothing more than a ruthless businessman, but over time (and it quite literally takes almost every minute of the film's 3+ hour runtime to come to fruition) he begins to realize not only the horrors transpiring around him, but also that he has the power (and thus the responsibility) to do something about it.  To me, that was the most endearing message that I took from the overall experience.Thus, I consider ""Schindler's List"" to be a masterpiece of American cinema (although, what should I have expected from Mr. Spielberg?!).  It is compelling on both a historic and personal level simultaneously.  Even though it is quite long, there are very few wasted moments."	5.0	The Importance Of One Man	2013-02-23	1	1	0
0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	Nominated for twelve Oscars, it combines fantastic acting from Liam Neeson in the title role, superb direction from Steven Spielberg and the best film music of all time from John Williams. The sequence towards the end when Schindler bursts into tears is bound to have you weeping like a new born. If you haven't seen it yet then do yourself a favour and do so. You'll be treating yourself to one of the most beautiful, brutal and moving films I have ever seen.The acting, directing, and script was all really great! Liam Neeson was the best part about this movie, though. Even though he isn't my favorite actor, he still put on one off the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. He was great! Liam Neeson is one of the best actors ever! The story is really good, too. It's history with meaning, but it still makes a really good movie. If you aren't sure still whether or not to see it, GO SEE IT! I'm telling you it is truly one of the best movies you will ever see!	5.0	WOW	2004-10-22	4	3	1

0783211856	Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2V4UN39TLBF4K	Zane	THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE. THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS THE BEST EVER. THE DIRECTION IS THE BEST EVER. SPIELBERG IS A MASTER. THE FILM EDITING IS SUPERB. THE ACTING IS GREAT. SCHINDLER'S LIST TELLS THE STORY OF OSKAR SCHINDLER. HE BECOMES A PROFITALBLE BUSINESS MAN IN KRAKOW, POLAND. WE ARE ALSO INTRODUCED TO AMON GOETH WHO IS PORTRAYED BY RALPH FIENNES. FIENNES GIVES THE BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE FILM. FIENNES LOST AT THE OSCARS TO TOMMY LEE JONES. IF YOU WATCH FIENNES AND THEN YOU WATCH JONES, YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IN THE WORLD FIENNES DIDN'T GET AN OSCAR. LIAM NEESON IS SUPERB AS OSKAR SCHINDLER. KINGSLEY GIVES A FINE SUPPORTING PERFROMANCE. THE BEST PICTURE OF THE DECADE AND ALSO THE BEST PICTURE EVER MADE. I DON'T SEE HOW CITIZEN KANE IS NUMBER 1 ON AFI 100 GREATEST. IF THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT TO SCHINDLER'S LIST, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST GAVE IT TO THE GODFATHER. ALL IN ALL, THE FINEST FILM EVER MADE. THE CAMERA MOVES BEAUTIFULLY JUST THE WAY SPEILBERG LIKES.	5.0	The best film ever made!	2002-08-19	0	0	0
