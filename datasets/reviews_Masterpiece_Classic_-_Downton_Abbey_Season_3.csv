1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3PNOYTQLQ4Z6C		I loved season one and two, but am concerned about where they are going with this.  I think they are adding issues from the 21 century into the 20th century, and I don't think it was like that back then.	3.0	Concerned where they are going with this.	2013-12-15	1	0	1
1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A31RTACUXXYBHQ		The characters are wonderful and the acting superb.  My disappointment is with the author who chose to eliminate 2 main characters in one season, with viewers emotionally attached to them.  It leaves me not able to trust the author in the future to repeat the same bad decision.  Therefore, many of my friends and myself included do not wish to be drawn in again to a story line that can blow up on us again.  The death of one main character is more than enough.	1.0	Downton Abbey Season 3 is Disappointing	2013-12-17	1	0	1
1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AH4AZ4KJPL6E0		Very disappointed to receive not only my 1st tape I ordered damaged, but 2nd tape of Downton Abbey I ordered was also damaged.  So here I just ordered like 7 other movies now.  I just get them in the mail, OMG April Love folks, movie doesn't even play on the stupid thing.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A39VZZASJFRMSN	"21stwifemom ""Kathy"""	I simply loved season 1. And 2. I could hardly wait. For season 3 and boy have I been disappointed. This show was refreshing and interesting the writers seemed to keep the show moving yet stay within the historic accuracy of the times. Sybil's death in childbirth was totally believable for the time, and lavinia's death from spanish flu also believable but Mathew's death from a. Motor vehicle accident on the very day that his first child was born. Was simply over the top and not even believable, to the ridiculous. I do not want to watch the news being broke or the grief......I think I will rewatch seasons 1 and 2 and dream of another beter ending. Three stars because I did love. Season 1 and 2 but Sadly season 3 imploded	3.0	Downton No More	2013-08-16	0	0	0

Hugh Bonneville and Dame Maggie Smith are remarkable in their roles and the honest and loving way this period is portrayed is incredibly refreshing.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1V4OL1O97BJ58	"aavidrose ""Movie Lover"""	I&#8217;m a cable cutter, so I&#8217;ve been catching up on a lot of older shows I had just never got around to watching before. Downton Abbey was one of them. I had heard good things about it and I knew it was the sort of show I&#8217;d like, but what surprised me a little was HOW MUCH I liked it. Binge watching to me is watching two or three episodes in a row. Downton Abbey had me up until 4:30am. I just had to watch &#8216;the next one&#8217;. Furthermore, I&#8217;m cheap. Friends say frugal. Potay-to, potah-to. When it came to Season (Series) 4, there was absolutely NO question that I was going to pay for it. In fact, I cannot remember how much the season was or if I even looked. Didn&#8217;t care. I HAD to see it. Alas, I am now a broken shell of a woman. I will have to wait almost another year before I can catch up with Mary, Anna, and the crew. Please be warned. If you have loved ones, a job, or any sort of life at all, be very careful of taking the road to Downton Abbey. You may not want to leave. EVER!	5.0	Beware, maddingly addictive	2014-03-05	0	0	0

I was going to give it 3 stars for that, but the writing and acting are all very good so I am giving it a 4.  Still I was really upset by this season, and seeing they will be charging for future seasons (like they are with Justified and other shows once you get a season or 2 into them) so I am giving up the show completely. :(	4.0	Just can't watch anymore	2014-01-20	0	0	0

I think the set of &#34;extras&#34; for season 3 may be the best in the series, and worth watching even if you don't like Downton. You can even watch them first, as I did, and not really get an episode spoiled with advance details- good stuff.The stories are still at their high level of quality, the detail of the sets is amazing, great casting- better all around  than just about any &#34;American&#34; television.I'm waiting for season 4 now, already planning to buy it too.	4.0	Great addition to your collection, worth the money	2013-02-10	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1CTI0OM6H9YNP	Adrian	The writing on this show is so masterfully crafted that after 3 seasons, I still wonder how it is that I'm so engaged in a families/community's lives.  To be honest, the lives of the Crowley's should mean very little to people - - they throw dinner engagements and draw very stiff lines in their moral compasses, yet you find that there is a pacing to the show that just draws your attention.  Perhaps the tertiary character of time/history is what is so appealing.  It's almost like we are growing with the characters through a period of time that was so globally progressive, so forward moving in technology and liberty, that you feel akin to the ride.

I will not give away the ending, but highly recommend one watches this entire series from the beginning. Was so happy to see it available on Amazon Prime. Pays to have that membership. Has saved me a fortune as I just can't get enough of the dramas. This series is probably the best ever done on any network, but the BBC certainly knows how to do it right. The drama never stops with a few shocks along the way. See what it was like to live at the turn of the 19th-20th century. The story never grows old as seen through new eyes. Family togetherness is the answer and sometimes the problem. The staff of servants are the best. Think it was easy to be a maid or kitchen helper or footman? No, but somethings still haven't improved to this day. Does money guarantee a happy life....NO! This is a must see.

Most of the freebees don't appeal to me, but this one certainly does.I am a great fan of the show, but I must admit that I find Seasons I and II more captivating than Season III.

I appreciated the modest behaviors of the women as well.I would recommend this to all girls age 15+ and all women. I think men would like it too but not in my household!

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2IJVSLL8D18SK	Alex	Wife and I disagreed on this series.  I thought it was excellent but a little contrived at times; she thought it was even better than Season 2. Anyway, we learn that Downton can survive without a second footman, but perhaps not for too long.  Acting by Michelle Dockery continues to be stellar.  Her work during a certain scene surrounding the death of a certain character was particularly brilliant. Maggie Smith gets too many one-liners but delivers them brilliantly. The Bates subplot might have benefitted from a trifle more legal realism.	4.0	Great but a little contrived	2013-08-15	0	0	0

I love the character development and the fact that they are not married to any characters and at any point someone will die and leave the series.  Perfect matching of characters to roles and it gives one an insight to an era which the likes we will never see again.  I believe that Maggie Smith was born for that role and it is so nice to see Elizabeth McGovern in a dramatic role.  Certainly a worthwhile series.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3NR8ZKPEB18R0	Alias	I will begin by saying that I wasn't too sure that I'd like the show before I started watching it and even a few episodes in. The reason is that there is so much going on, so many characters that are referenced that it can be difficult to keep up. However, this uncertainty didn't last long for me. I am now emotionally invested in the characters and the future of Downtown Abbey.This show is set in the pre and post Great War. There are little things that are weaved into the storyline that remind us of what we now take for granted: swivel chairs, toasters, and cars, for example.There are bigger issues that affect the characters of Downtown Abbey such as World War I, the women's rights movement, gay rights, and Modernism. There is definitely a tug of war between conservative English values and the direction the modern world is taking.On top of that, we have characters who are dealing with timeless issues such as love, heartbreak, economic downturns, etc. All of the characters add something special to the show. Even if something doesn't add up in the moment, it will eventually come back and make sense at some point near or far. The episodes resolve certain topics, which are settled by the end of an episode. But there are also other topics that continue on throughout the seasons.I can't get enough of Downton Abbey and look forward to watching future seasons.	5.0	Wasn't sure if I'd like the show going into it, but ended up loving it!	2013-10-11	0	0	0

Season 3 has quite a bit of soapy drama, contrived drama, and some ridiculous circumstances to accommodate actors leaving the show (which was originally supposed to end after the first series, so I can't blame them, but it's tough to see them handled in such a way after building relationships with them for 15 years in show-time.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1GFSHGRANBQZ4	"Allen E. Davis ""Mr_Camera71"""	We thoroughly enjoyed this series that gives a glimpse into what life was like for the British elite and their support staffs back in the early 1900's. It's interesting to see the roles of the butler, valet's, footmen, maids and cooks. They seem to spend every waking moment hard at work supporting the Lord of the house and his family. There are a lot of sad events in this series which tends to be a downer but overall it is an excellent series. Can't wait for season 4!	5.0	Downton Abbey	2013-10-30	0	0	0

During August our daughter was visiting us from Baltimore and, since her husband doesn't care to watch it with her, she had watched Season 3 on PBS alone.  So we did as we had done in 2012 when she was here: after everyone else had gone to bed, we settled down with some snacks and wine and watched Season 3 == several nights in a row.  It was just as good as when we'd seen it previously but more fun to laugh and cry our way through it together.

It takes you back in time and you can see yourself in their shoes whether you are Lady Mary or Mrs. Patmore and you see their lives and dreams and what could be. Of course it is like a soap opera with the good and the bad. It is sad that we lost some great cast members like Lady Sybil, Matthew Crawley (cried) and O'Brien but she brought the evil side to the story.

I've always held that without great writing, a show is nothing. But, this series has more than just great writing. The direction, lighting, cinematography, in short, everything is top shelf. The attention to detail is awesome.It all of this comes together to create a whole that seems effortless and natural. It is art. The Brits have outdone themselves.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AL4CVRKHS3KIC	Amazon Customer	At this point in the series it isn't hard to figure out who will stay or go, live or die, etc. Nevertheless, I really enjoy the setting and watching the changes in fashion and technology and how certain characters react to them, and especially the banter between the characters as they try to get along with each other. My only criticism is that the attempts to address some modern issues are too transparent and simplistic. I don't mind entrainment making a point as long as it's not at the expense of entertaining me. By remaining true to the period and issues of the time I think the audience will see and appreciate how society has evolved to what it is today.

I found seasons 1-3 of the show on Amazon Prime and watched it on my kindle or via my iPhone streamed via apple TV to my TV.  I loved it.  The thing I realized partway through was that this is the UK version which is basically the unedited version. On regular TV, we get the PBS version which is edited to fit a specific timeframe so there are pieces missing.  This was a great way to catch up on the series all at once. Very good show and the UK version was excellent.	5.0	Watching Dowton Abbey seasons 1-2 on Amazon Prime was the best idea	2014-01-28	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ASV2AGV99ORZN	Amazon Customer	In general, I cannot stand the British upper class and all their tradition, manners, etc.  Thus I resisted watching this series for a long time.  But, even so, I find it very worth while.  It seems almost every character is well thought out, with his or her own odd turns and twists.  With several seasons, this just goes on and on, and pulls you in.  Also, it is very well filmed and visually interesting.  I highly recommend this.	5.0	Very compelling drama,  Well Done.	2014-01-08	0	0	0

Too negative.Branson could be a much more interesting story.  A lot happened between Ireland and England in 1918-1920's.The negative barbs that fly during the show fits today's &#34;I got one up on you&#34; mindset.Robert has been placed into his position to be the decision maker throughout his entire life.  Now the characters around him belittle him for sometimes making the final hard decision.  The show has made him out to be the &#34;out of touch&#34; patriarch.  I feel this is a shame.  At the end of the day all he is trying to do is protect his family.I keep waiting for Anna Bates to start singing The hills are alive....I just can't keep watching.

It creates a world of characters so closely to their relife or fictional real life counter parts that you're able to relate to it even if you're not from the 18th or early 19th Centuries and that's, enough said.	5.0	Dowton Abbey Seaon 3 [HD]	2014-01-23	0	0	0

The setting is breath taking, the costumes remain lovely, and perfect to the period in which the storyline continues. I suppose for me at this point is concerning Mr. Bates...is he a good man, or does he hide a deep dark secret? Perhaps season four, might lend some more hints which will allow an accurate conclusion.	5.0	Downton Abbey continues to deliver!	2013-11-13	0	0	0

The costumes, sets, locations and everything related to creating a quality period drama are mesmerizing.  The acting is superb and all the more convincing because it is understated (typical of the Brits).What I like best about DA is the realistic peek it gives us into the lives of a noble family AND the lives of their servants, too.  What one of us Americans hasn't seen the castles and huge halls in England and wondered what sort of people once lived there and what type of lives they might have led before the modern era?Now you can find out!  :)	5.0	Totally Addictive	2013-02-16	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2OQ5ZZZL0RJCT	Amazon Customer	I am not nearly as engaged with season three of Downton as I was with one and two. Not being engaged means I am able to notice how completely silly the show is. The Granthams are ridiculous, flouncing about with their privilege. Violet is still funny but her lines seem forced and non-organic to the flow of conversation. The love story between Anna and Bates limps on, and Bates could be a complex character but the saccharine sweetness of the plot line jerks us back to the simple minded. Maybe it will perk up?	2.0	Becoming a Standard Soap Opera	2013-01-24	9	7	2

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3MYRZW9TGGIZC	amy wallace	With many unpredictable twists of its plot, Downton Abbey has been an interesting glimpse into English life after WWI. The characters all have their flaws, and that makes it more interesting to return to each week. I think each season gets better at drawing us into their drama.  We started with season one this year, and the first episode did not draw my husband into the storyline.  However, once he saw the second one, he was hooked.  This is one we watch together.	5.0	Downton Abbey....see it.	2013-09-22	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1PJX7Y2V3SICE	AndreaF	I watched Season 3 of Downton Abbey with many and varied emotions, as usual.  I still love the acting, the writing, and the progression of the characters as well as the story line!  I am now anxiously awaiting Season 4, along with the better part of almost 12,000 of my fellow reviewers, and have begun a campaign to get my husband to watch this series... preferably from Season 1 so that I can watch it all over again, myself!Of course, there were a few things that I didn't like.  I may be in the minority regarding this, but I did not like Shirley MacLaine as Cora's mother.  I thought that her performance was mostly forced and dry, although it was well-written in the fact that Martha Levinson was intended to be Violet's opposite yet equal force.  I felt that Ms MacLaine was only moderately successful in the role, but that's just my opinion.I also felt that the Bates story line was a bit overdone, and was glad when it came to a conclusion.  The season's ending, of course, was a stunner, but I'm not believing anything until I see it in a coffin.  (That's my ostrich impression for the day.)  Mrs. Hughes and her health condition was riveting; I felt for her every step of the way. I did not too much like the flighty-cousin (Rose) story line, but I did like her kindness to Anna, and the fact that she obviously has some kind of drama coming around the bend.I still recommend this series; I do love to watch it, and can't wait to see what happens!	4.0	Wonderful!

The show develops the characters so well that I get genuinely upset with the writers when we lose one. Not to mention that without any action or graphics, the beautiful reenactment of the early 1900s and relationship dynamics of the characters make this show far more exciting than any blockbuster movies you have to spend $10 to go see.	5.0	Getting better with each season.	2014-05-19	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1MZIEQL4BI1T1	"Animal Lover ""Animal Lover"""	It reminds me of Pride and Prejudice - but more down to earth and more in depth.  The story starts in 1912 with the Titanic sinking, leaving no heir to the ancestral manor.  It centers on one aristocratic family with 3 grown daughters and grandmother.  It shows the same feelings of pride, betrayal, jealousy, loneliness, love, envy, prejudices etc. all mirrored in the servants and upper class.  It is a changing world with the coming and going of WWI - but not everyone can embrace the new world - destruction of manor life, woman's right to vote, work.  I absolutely love the story; it is so real and can  apply to any of us in any age.  Life is change and in this period of history, it comes swiftly after so many years of being stagnant.  There is sorrow and joy, overcoming obstacles with perseverance and love.  The characters are real (the countess is an American) and so very different.  It is like looking at a pocket of the world with all of its qualities and evils in this one small sample, Downton Abbey.  It is the BEST I have seen in a very long time.	5.0	Powerful and very real life story	2014-01-31	0	0	0

If you are a soap opera watcher, a drama show watcher, a love story watcher, and a mystery watcher then you will love Downton Abbey.I laughed, I got mad, and most of all I cried. I fell in love with all of the characters ok maybe not Thomas. Really I suggest you start from the beginning you have until January 5th when the 4 th season starts. Hurry watch them, I did it on my new Roku I bought from amazon. On the amazon app on my roku which it had a three seasons. Netflix didnt have it and Hulu had it but it kept losing the connection.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1VDOSAACMTBVC	Anne C Newhouse	I love Downton Abbey, and was hooked from the outset. I feel quite invested in it, actually, so I was disappointed in some of the storylines in season three. There are three examples I specifically felt, well, unsatisfied with all three situations: first, Mr. Bates' prison woes, which dragged on and focused too much on the inner prison corruption, which was never fully explored, and conversely neglected Anna's detective work. Second, the whole relationship with Tom and the maid, whose name escapes me at the moment. I am completely unsure about Tom's part in it, and because of that, I am not sure why it was an issue at all. Social climbing that crosses class boundaries? Probably, but it was unsatisfying to me because it was so cursorily explored. I was glad to see it end, but learned nothing new from it. Finally, of course, there is the death of Matthew which was just too melodramatic for words. Awfully handled. Any soap opera fan could have come up with such a sob story, and I was so disappointed. There were so many other ways to handle it - why go with something so trite?Now that I've aired my grievances, however, I want to make sure I give credit for the dramas that reeled me in: Belowstairs storylines kept me enthralled: Thomas B/O'Brien schemes are wonderful, Mrs. Hughes and Carson, and the perils of Ethel - what a cautionary tale there! Upstairs, the Dowager Lady Grantham, of course, goes without saying - I can never watch an episode without thinking, &#34;I should write that down so I can use it later!&#34;. All of the storylines (with the exception of Matthew's death and Tom's near-dalliance?? are lovely. Robert's brief affair - his struggle there was much more deftly handled than the former. But the shining spot in season three for the haves, in my opinion, is Lady Edith's storyline. What grit she has! If ever a woman would fly in the face of tradition - and we can see that she will - it is Edith. THAT makes sense.Too much? I must stop. This is getting ridiculous, and I have things to do! Thanks for giving me a forum!	3.0	A little soapier than Seasons 1 and 2...	2014-01-04	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A29UACM83DRFSJ	Anne Favrot	Downtown Abbey a hit for the 21st century! The challenges of an English Lord, his family and their servants unfold as they face constant changes brought about by the dawning of the 20th century! Automobiles replace horse drawn carriages, buffet stye cabaret nights replace formal dining, and class lines blur and reform as the inhabitants live their lives each day at the manor house. But human nature never changes, and the politics of  life 'below stairs' and sibling rivalries above continue apace. It is a story to make you appreciate the difficulty of trying to be a good man or woman in any situation. The actors are amazing, the writing on target for the period with a few nods to modern slang, and as always the locations and sets bring the place alive.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1AYNQ4Q8AZ0X	anonymous	"Though I had some minor quibbles, I enjoyed Season 3 of ""Downton Abbey"" a lot.  It proved it's still an addictive, well-acted, stylish soap.  It was a lot of fun even though I didn't like all that went down at Downton this year....SPOILER WARNING!For instance, it made no sense that Martha Levinson would come to town for Mary's nuptials but not Edith's wedding, Sybil's funeral or the birth of Mary and Matthew's son.  (Perhaps she'll show up at the start of Season 4 to meet her new grandson and mourn Matthew.) It also made no sense (and infuriated me) that Mr. Bates felt bad enough for Thomas that he went to bat for him when he was going to be fired without a job reference.  Given how poorly Thomas had always treated Mr. Bates, it was hard to believe that anyone--even Bates--would be so pious, so forgiving.  And the reappearance of Ethel just so she could give up her baby didn't seem to serve much purpose except to give Matthew's mother a new project (and cause friction between her and the Crawleys after she put Ethel to work in her house).That's not to say there weren't great dramatic moments this year....Mary and Matthew's wedding kicked things off with lots of style; Edith getting jilted at the altar was unfortunate but very entertaining; Sybil's death was shocking but forced the Crawleys to accept and respect Tom as a member of the family, and it drove a wedge between Robert and Cora.  (Leave it to Violet to find a way to bring them back together!) I was sad to see Matthew die because the show's Juliet has now lost her Romeo.  I enjoyed watching their relationship blossom over the first two seasons, and I thought the show handled their short married life well by having them butt heads from time to time.  They were never boring, but now that part of the story has come to an abrupt (and unplanned) end.  I know this isn't what the creator had in mind for the couple, so I hope the show can survive the loss of Matthew.END SPOILERSI believe in rating not just the show itself but the Blu-ray too.  Like its predecessors, this season's Blu-ray release of ""Downton Abbey"" is presented in 1080i and 2.0 stereo (according to the back of the case).  Other websites have stated in their professional reviews that the video is actually 1080p.  Either way, it looks great.  However, the fact that the audio consists of 2 channels only is ridiculous.  In 2013, it's commonplace for shows to be released with 5.1 mixes, and this show would certainly benefit from the extra channels.  And like its predecessors, this season's release has neither a printed nor on-screen episode guide with descriptions of each episode, nor does it have a season play feature that remembers where you left off.  I find these omissions inexcusable given the fact that the episodes are simply numbered (not entitled) on screen (except for the special episode that aired on Christmas in England).  Not even the disc labels tell you which episodes are contained on which discs: you have to pop them into your player to find that out.  For these reasons, I'm taking a full star off this product's rating.Though I was a bit disappointed here and there, I still found myself riveted to the show.  I look forward to Season 4 with great enthusiasm! Highly recommended."	4.0	Still A Jolly Good Time to Be Had	2013-01-31	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3LTZGHZBBBQX0	Anthony L.	There is no other show on television that plays with our emotions and moods as successfully as Downton Abbey. The classy story of the Grantham family and the parallel world of their servants will involve you, thrill you, make you cry, laugh, cringe, and repeatedly draw you back for more! If you are the kind of person who has time on their hands, any Downton Abbey disc should come with a disclaimer: Do NOT watch unless you want to get hopelessly addicted!Sure it's a wee bit soapy, and some scenes border on the melodramatic and the sentimental, but heck, who cares? That's the entire reason it succeeds; it's pure unadultered escapism entertainment. Well that and Downton Abbey's superb cast, led by the impeccableHugh Bonnevilleand the greatElizabeth McGovern, with the incomparableMaggie Smithgiving a fiery supporting lead, with Dan Stevens, Brendan Coyle, and Michelle Dockery rounding out the talented main cast.Add to that excellent cinematography, rich costumes, beautiful sets and scenery, and authentic dialogue, and you have the makings of a fine show indeed. But when you add to THAT the brilliant human emotion, tangled relationships, colorful, sympathetic characters, wry humour, and a smart, fast-paced plot...you have the makings of near-perfection as only Masterpiece Theatre can make. This is Downton Abbey, and while it is not as epic as Game of Thrones, or as riveting as Breaking Bad or Person of Interest, Downton Abbey is like no other show on television. Your moods will rise and fall with the episodes and the fate of your favourite characters, be it Nurse O'Brien (who we all love to hate), or Edith Crawley (who we all hate to love) and every time you pop in the disc, you will be swept away for a wonderful evening of escapism to the lush mansion of Downton.Here's to much Downtonian delight in the future! 4.5 Stars!	5.0	Soapy, but addictive, exciting, and classy!	2013-09-11	1	1	0

When I compared episode 3 on Amazon to the PBS-broadcast version, I found most of the missing material to be important for viewers to understand what is happening in the series.  Amazon advertises this as ""original UK version"" but in seasons 1 and 2, the UK versions have more running time and the USA PBS version are the shortened edited versions.  Very confusing.  If you want the most for your money, wait a few weeks for the DVD's and make sure these episodes run the full 53 minutes instead of the edited 48 minute versions."	1.0	Shortened Versions of PBS Edition	2013-01-22	28	20	8

The show is wonderful and renewed my love of GB.  A perfect timing with all the great things going on there with the Royal family and Olympics.  This show reminds me of what great tv used to be like!  It is reminds me of old mini-series like North and South, Roots, etc.  The Scarlet Pimpernel staring Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews (1982) was my favorite show since it first aired and I still love it.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3MHWG1OWOQMPG	art lewis	".This review is of Seasons 1, 2, and the first episode of Season 3.  I'll be watching the rest of Season 3 as it becomes available.I want to avoid spoilers or plot giveaways, so I'll just describe overall characteristics of the show.This fascinating, serious drama evinces a subtle, generous love of humanity, and makes you love humanity, the wonderful qualities, the foibles, and the frailties, and how all that stands up to the darker side of human nature.  The writing is excellent; the show's plot always has me on edge.  Out of dozens of characters two or three are bad and rather wicked, but on the whole it seems every episode moves me at some point to shed a tear or two because of the kindness and goodness and generosity of various characters.  And it's not that the writers set out in a contrived way to do that.  It all unfolds very naturally out of the drama itself.The show is not a comedy, but there are touches of humor here and there that manage to be moving even as they amuse.  The show is about an extended family of the British aristocracy and their servants.  The daughters are looking to get married.  So are some of the servants.  There is even a murder.  Oh, yes, and World War I is going on during a number of episodes, involving all the characters in huge changes.  And it turns out there are some beautifully noble qualities in some of these titled nobles, as well as in a number of their servants.  The few characters with a more or less sinister side just add more drama, nuance, and depth to a show that on the whole reveals the best of human beings, without oversimplifying them.  Something about this show trusts human beings.  It makes me think that perhaps the best of Britain is something ""very good indeed."""	5.0	Great story with a heart of gold: Seasons 1, 2, and first episode of Season 3	2013-01-10	3	2	1

Halfway through the first episode I was totally hooked. I love the characters and the way they and the story lines develop from episode to episode. It's great to see the clothes and decor and manners from that era and part of the world. Season 3 was heartbreaking though. During the last episode I shouted out loud, &#34;No!!&#34; I think many watchers did the same. How could it be? I was so saddened by the events of the final episode in that season that I just sat there staring into space, and finally just went to bed! Kind of funny to be so into any show that it would have that effect on me, but it did. I'm really looking forward to Season 4.	5.0	Wonderful show - sad season	2013-10-18	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2DHO5MCCSAHIP	"Astrid Dars ""Bookmom"""	I really don't watch TV.  I find most of it drivel, but I love love love Downton Abbey.  I love how it moves us through the passage of time, how the characters evolve with change, their struggles, and the many storylines that exist.  We get a fantastic view into the upstairs and the downstairs of the English past.  If you love costumes then you will be in love.  The costuming is absolutely exquisite.  The work on these is amazing.  Once again the show how styles changed through time is beautifully done.  They respect the various age groups and the research here is fantastic.  The acting is fabulous.  We are so lucky to have such great people working together.  I am not very eloquent and this show deserves eloquence.  If you do watch it try and see it from the beginning so you can love each time period all the trials and tribulations and also the joys.  I don't miss an episode.  When I am not home I catch up by buying the episode on Amazon and watching it instantly.  I've also pre-ordered the seasons over the past years.  Don't miss this series.  It is another one of the BBC genius pieces that will long remain as a world wide favorite.	5.0	BBC Genius Series - History, Costumes, Actors, and Plot -- everything in one package!	2013-01-16	1	1	0

The character depth developed within each and every person you &#34;meet&#34; on this show will make you develop attachments much like you would with people in your real life. I find myself thinking about what they might be doing as I'm going about my own daily business, crazy as that sounds!

The end of the season was heartbreaking, but true to Downton form, it kept you wanting more and didn't sugar coat real life. These tragic things make the show stay real. The writers are phenomenal as the dialogue is superb. I cannot wait to get into Season 4...ending Season 3 was the kind of letdown that you feel like when you finish reading a terrific book.

I did a marathon veiwing over a 3 weekend peroid to catch up on all the parts of the story I had missed. I am so very glad that I not only did Season I and 2, but finally did Season 3 as I got hooked on the US version at the beginning of Season 4. I am now able to see what happened and to follow how each person became such a reality to me, like getting to know and old friend all over again. I cried , laughed, but was in awe of the costuming that occurred over the course of time. I made new friends, and got to see why these people become who they were. I must say that Dame Maggie, has become my ideal perception of a Dowager who really has a way with words.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A34XJ34R5GTT5O	Barbara Albert	For those of us who remember Upstairs Downstairs, this will probably disappoint. There are some good performances, and some stinkers, and most fall in between the two. For me, the characters in most control of their roles through the twists turns and romp of it all seem to be Jim Carter (Carson), Phyllis Logan (Mrs. Hughes), Penelope Wilton (Isobel Crawley) Leslie Nichol (the cook) and the most satisfying of all, Maggie Smith (the Dowager Countess). The rest of the cast was very mediocre as I recall, but I feel the writing would have challenged any of them. Less than stellar writing aside, I felt that Elizabeth McGovern's acting was insipid as she seemed like a languid cat too tired to really bother with anything and seemed to be watching herself from offstage in a hurry to get it over with.  I am holding this up to an impossibly high standard by comparing it to Upstairs Downstairs, and I should close by saying that although it is not a masterpiece, it has some merit and certainly entertains more than the usual fare.	3.0	Entertaining but not really stellar	2014-02-15	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A207XNEKW8AXLH	Barbara A. Rockwell	I feel like this season of Downton Abbey was rushed through. Why so many 2 hours episodes? Why did they have to kill off the 2 best characters in the show. Sybil's death was bad enough; I know people who cried for days. The thing about Downton that kept it so special was how real the characters are & how attached people became to them. The ending was horrific! I still can't get poor Matthew's face with his eyes open & blood running down out of my head. Not very classy Downton, more like a horror movie. After 2 season's of watching Mary & Matthew squable & flirt, then finally fall in love, this was no way to end the show. I could think of many ways to have written him & Sybil out of the story without killing them. I knew before the season started that Matthew was leaving; which kind of ruined it for me, but i never, ever would have anticipated this. Mary was loveable with Matthew; he brought out the best in Mary. Now is she going to go back to the brazen, sharp tongued bully she was in season one?	3.0	Shame on you Downton Abbey!	2013-02-23	1	1	0

Downton Abbey has forced me to re-evaluate that knee-jerk response, at least this time.Nothing about this show does not please, satisfy and gratify the viewing experience.  I have to say I am glad I waited until 3 seasons were available, as I am a marathon viewer (LOST in 2 months, etc)....only downside is having to wait now for season 4, and decide if I can handle a once-a-week experience versus obsessive single-sitting through multiple episodes.  But, that's a decision for a few months down the road.Love me a good series, and now they all are compared thusly:  &#34;Good, but no Downton Abbey&#34;.  Best. Thing.

But was pleasantly surprised by the continued excellent quality.Too bad they had to involve Shirley MacLaine... she looks terrible, is a stooped wrinkled old lady and still as kooky and arrogant as ever... a distraction, not at all charming like Maggie Smith.  She is a distraction and a detraction from the show, not an enhancement.	5.0	Best TV in years	2013-10-08	0	0	0

Clean up several scenes andremove the out of character slips Lord Grantin did with the maid and you would have a jewel.Why are the directors so afraid they will loose their audience if they don't go over the line with  more information and graphicsthan people need  to make a point.  Some kinds of sensationalism arent appropriate.  The audience would grow were these few offensive scenes eliminatred.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2WM6D8ACRSGNF	Barbara  Remley Martin	Wonderfully composed story series about an actual place and time amid the tremors of a changing and complex social structure.  I, living in the US am intrigued by the haves and haves not, put in place before one is born.  No middle class leaves an abruptness and starkly different expectations which result in resentment.  Season 3 still involves the affects of World War ! and the hopes for a looser social interpretation by those wishing to bend the rules.  I love the characters and how they have evolved.

After being hooked during several August 2013 Southwest Air flights where Season 1 was offered for free, I got on the public library waiting list for seasons 2 & 3. It only took a few weeks to get the Season 2 DVDs, but by January 2014, I still hadn't received the email that Season 3 was available. I had just signed up for Amazon Prime and was so pleased that I no longer had to wait to move to the top of the library waiting list! Everything worked well to view DA EXCEPT, apparently it's not available out of the country. I had a long two week wait between episodes 3 & 4 until I was back in the US. Other than that problem, I recommend both DA Season 3 and Amazon Prime. I'm not the type of person to want to own DVD's and watch again so this is a great option for me.	5.0	Downton Abbey Catch-up	2014-01-31	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A34WBE1OIW4SGZ	Bayarea Shopper	It's this simple. Anyone who has loved the show Seasons 1 and 2 will love Season 3 as well. So, whether I say 4 or 5 stars is totally irrelevant. Same excellent performances, stories, art direction, cinematography.SPOILERS:For those who have already seen Season 3, there were a few really exasperating storylines, the first just doesn't make any dramatic logic:1) Thomas, who was known by both downstairs and upstairs to be a conniving schemer who'd done more than one bad turn toward Bates, trying to implicate him in made-up theft -- enough to earn the scorn of both Lord Grantham and Mr. Carson -- goes thru yet another story cycle where he is to be sent on his way, but no, yet again he is suddenly forgiven hocus pocus, he's a grand old chap, and it's back to same old Thomas in his dapper black tails. I found it disingenuous.2) Oh geez, then Saint Mr. Bates, such a good honorable, decent, kind man, finally is out of prison and united with his wife, and what does he do? Goes and interferes to help Thomas get a great reference, which then becomes cause for keeping him on staff. Such a stupid move. Which leads to 3)3) I loved the whole Anna & Mr. Bates story in Season 1... Then having the difficulties in Season 2, and seeing the honorable man Bates encouraging Anna to forget him and find a better man, well it was chivalrous at first, and my feelings were positive. But as this continued, after time & again Anna would express with no ambiguity that she accepted him the way he is no matter what, yet he'd mope about and send her away, it started to get tiresome to me --- not Anna, she's never had one false note in her character nor the actress in her completely well rounded performance. But Mr. Bates' over and over again putting her off, and the battle with the ex-wife, handled, then still there, started to grow tiresome. Only to lead to this whole murder thing with the wife, it seemed over the top to me... like this guy is a more elaborate Charlie Brown from the Charles Schulz comic strip, nothing ever goes his way. ... So then Season 3 and oh my God endless repetitious scenes of Bates in prison, with same expression on his face, it all could have been shot in one day and intercut into 6 or 8 scenes in 5 or 6 episodes, just boring. The only thing that made it interesting is just watching Anna's performance and the way she speaks. ... So all the more reason when Bates finally gets out of prison, due to this tireless work of Anna, he goes and plays the martyr yet again with his lend-a-brotherly-hand to Thomas -- the guy who caused him so much pain and grief.and 4) as for the finale of Season 3, I can only review it in relation to learning, after the fact, that the actor wanted out at the conclusion of his 3-year contractr, just as the actress playing Sybil wanted out after her 3-years was up... so they had to write them both out.  So the 2 deaths were a bit much story-wise. Sybil's was completely believable and well handled. Matthew's was, well what can you say.	4.0	Impossible to explain this review/rating without SPOILERS --------------------	2014-06-15	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ACN1NNU7C9SLU	bcb	Downton Abbey is the best Masterpiece I've ever seen -- much better than Upstairs Downstairs, the only series that was even comparable.  Beware of Season 3's surprising losses of characters you loved -- the actors playing them wanted to move on to other things.  It's well worth watching.  I got so hooked last year that I cheated and watched the UK Season 4 online before it was available here.  I liked it so much that I'll still watch it when it is available here.	5.0	Downton Abbey Is Addictive and Great!	2013-11-29	0	0	0

I don't think a master of the house would have a allowed a suspected homosexual man to be his private valet.  Since that was a very intimate position.  If not for any other reason than they might be suspected of the same behavior or bringing shame on the house name.  I do think the compassion that was exercised could have happened though.

I especially like the historical references to a time and place I will never be able to live in or otherwise understand. I wonder how much of Julian Fellowes' writing is research and how much is &#34;wisdom of hindsight&#34;- that is looking at where civilization is today and trying to build a historical context for it.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A42SV9B6226ZB	BELLE S. TIONGCO	I'm addicted to Downton Abbey.  I'm addicted to the dialogue, to the fashion, to the twists and turns of life in the Grantham realm.  I love the show for the values that it promotes - values long forgotten and exchanged for the seemingly more exciting lives of housewives and misguided youth.  So bring back the times when people lived and died for honour.  When every person's ultimate battle, rich or poor, consisted of enlarging the good and bright, and diminishing the dark and evil in his being. Visually, there is little on international television that can compete with the magnificent production, editing and cinematography of Downton Abbey.  It is just visual excellence, from Day One.  I am soooo looking forward to Matthew and Mary's wedding....	5.0	"A ""classier"" time ..."	2012-09-20	314	253	61

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3MX1K4N89OWE1	Bemused	I think they have made a grave mistake in killing off Matthew. I think it is a cheap literary plot twister that is trite and overused:it just tells me that they are running out of ideas. I was quite fond of the actor and will miss him and his character. I have no desire to seek out the fourth season, if in deed, there will be one. Very poor choice on many levels. Now I understand why Connan Doyle had to resurrect Holmes. Will Matthew survive his injuries? Is he not dead just in a many episodes coma? Will any one care at this point? Very 'cheap shot&#34; at creativity. Shame on you all.

The story is great, the characters are fascinating, the period clothing fun to see, and the show sticks well to historical events. I was too young for the old &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; show but I think this is similar, showing the great divide in classes during that time.

I think that I was able to watch all of the episodes to catch up (3 seasons worth) in a little longer than one weekend.

This part is set in the 1920's England and the aristocracy is having to adapt to changing times.  Servants are demanding more rights and the mores of certain things such as childbirth, homosexuality and prostitution are discussed in new lights.  Fashion is changing also with the dress length continuously rising.  The vast estate is undergoing an income slump and figuring out how to bring in more money to keep the lifestyle presents problems.	5.0	Such a great period piece!	2013-09-29	0	0	0

I had heard what a good show it was, but I didn't want to jump into the new season without viewing seasons 1 - 3 first.  I watched all three seasons in 5 days!  Engaging, well written story that is beautifully filmed and well acted.  It gives a great historical perspective of the times, members of the various classes and how they interacted between and among themselves as well as how they dealt with the changes to the social structures that were inevitable and obvious to some.  Anyone who is a history buff and intrigued with the maintenance and eventual fall of the great estates of England will be as smitten with the entire series as I have been.	5.0	New fan	2014-01-18	0	0	0

The viewer gets involved in the lives of the characters as the story illustrates the impact that WW1 had on society. The century-old aristocracy is unraveling and, just as one would expect, there are those who embrace the changes & those who are going down with a fight. Through it all, life still happens: people love, envy, fear, care and die. No matter the &#34;rank,&#34; all people experience the stuff of being human.	5.0	I love it.	2013-02-07	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A23WHBXY0M58ZO	Beverly Clyde	I had seen season 3 on television but had missed all season 1 and most of season 2.  I decided to watch season 3 again just for fun. I spent several weeks -- each day watching a show -- until I had finished all 3 seasons.  Downton Abbey presents well the period and the changes going on during this period.  While this period of history is frequently ignored, there were many important changes that took place during this time.  If you enjoy Downton Abbey or are just beginning to watch Downton Abbey -- give yourself a treat and watch all 3 seasons one right after the other.	5.0	Watched it again just for fun	2013-10-17	0	0	0

This was recommended to us by friends.  Thankfully, Amazon has all 3 seasons available for instant download.  I went through all three seasons in less than 2 weeks and am looking forward to season 4.  I'm disappointed that all the characters will not be returning, but it is understandable that actors will move on to other pursuits.  It's well worth a look and if you enjoy it like we did, it will be like one of those books you just can't put down.	5.0	Definitely A Masterpiece	2013-02-05	1	1	0

It's nothing more than a mouthpiece for the militant gay promotion of their lifestyle choice as born that way. I get enough of this demented stuff shoved in my face every day. I don't need characters in a period drama which I really, really have enjoyed before this doing the same.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1ZS0F7PQJUDRM	"booklady ""RRFOL"""	I've watched all three seasons during the past month and this third one is not as good as the other two. The plot manipulations are so obvious that they've become tedious. What once felt realistic (such as the plotting below stairs) is now absurd. The feel is now that of a lowly soap opera, only with a high-class setting and costumes.The other fault I find is the amount of makeup on the actors. I so enjoyed the un-made-up look of the first seasons. I'm sure they had makeup on then, but it didn't look as if they did. In season three, however, it's obvious and out of place.	3.0	Slipping	2014-06-11	0	0	0

I don't know why but I've always had a fascination with the English and their lifestyles.  Downton Abbey presents an interesting story of high society living as well as a view from the servants perspective.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the series so far, the acting is very well done by all.  One of my favorite characters is Violet Crawley the Dowager Countess.

I've seen probably 80% of the shows and I was expecting a slow moving ""soap opera"". I was surprised that it is well written with many plots and sub plots that keep the story moving along. It also has plenty of antagonists and plot twists. Overall, I'd say it's no action flick and not for everyone but for me it boils down to a good story that it well acted.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1T6MQBK8ZVW0F	Brenda Krekeler	Spoiler. Season 3 was tear jerking as well as with great humor (Maggie Smith).  This is difficult to start with because I find each character/actor/actress so impressive.  Who pops to mind first? Thinking about season 3 brings me to the terror of Sybil's death.  Of course everyone at this point has fallen in love with Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay).  The shear agony of everyone in the household which now includes the &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; audience, is shocked by her death.  I was impressed by the truth of the era where child birth was indeed common.  Regardless, I had trouble facing the fact of her death.  The argument between Sybil's parents was so honest and Tom's heartache with his daughter was real.  I believed.  Throughout Season 3 Tom Branson's (Allen Leech) strength of character developed and the entire family gathered support for him and Sibby.  The storyline of John Bates (Brendan Coyle) was remarkable.  The prison scenes were grueling but Anna (Joanne Froggatt) was always there for her man. It was remarkable that Bates got to come back home.  Mary (Michelle Dockery) always shows such stress that I can't find her character remarkable at all.  The cast of the the &#34;house&#34; are significantly more impressive and lots more fun! Thomas (Rob James-Collier) albeit arrogant has a deeper character in Season 3 and he bridges so well with the rest of the house staff.  I could go on about each character but the above are my best of the best.  Of course we must include the kind, gentle and most lovable of the cast, Matthew (Dan Stevens).  In Seasons 1 & 2 he quietly worked his magic charm into the entire family and this season he won Downton Abbey via monetarily as well as in marriage.  The terrible accident that befalls Matthew at the end of Season 3 has so traumatized fans that they tell me they will never watch another episode of Downton Abbey.  I myself have been in mourning since the end of last season, but I am waiting with baited breath for Season 4.  I would be devastated if any spoiler alert on Season 4 would be sent my way prior to watching it in January 2014 in the &#34;States.&#34; - - - High Definition on Amazon Prime is TOP-NOTCH programming at its finest !	5.0	Spectacular Cast !

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AUX7KVELDYZZ6	"Brett H ""pentangle"""	The much anticipated Downton Abbey Series 3 starts in Spring 1920, carrying on from the superb Christmas Special which was set over the 1919/20 holiday period. The first episode picks up with Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley at last about to get hitched, but as usual there is quite a lot going on at Downton both above and below stairs and you just know that nothing is going to go smoothly.Shirley Maclaine makes her appearance as Martha Levinson, Lady Grantham's American mother. As usual, Violet, played by Maggie Smith manages to set the scene with some rather pithy comments. Martha has no time for the stuffy English and their traditions and is not slow to voice her opinion. Clearly she was introduced as a foil to Maggie Smith and the interplay between the two does work very well as one suspected it would. Violet seems to manage to continue to dominate any scene she is in.There are plenty of dramatic moments in the new series, as life on the Downton estate returns to more as it was shown in the first series, before the First World War when it served as a convalescent home for injured servicemen. However, there are new challenges for Downton in the post war period and there has to be change for the estate to survive. The interaction between the family and those that serve them `below stairs' continues to be a rich source of story lines for the script writers and is a major contribution to the success of the show.Downton Abbey is the most successful costume drama from British TV since Brideshead Revisited some thirty years ago - and this is quite an accolade as they produce a lot of this sort of drama in the UK. Regular viewers of Downton will have been holding their breath wondering whether Series 3 could possibly keep up the very high standards of the previous episodes. However, we need not have worried and few will be disappointed with the latest series. You really wonder how far Downton can go - personally I would not be surprised if it runs up to the 1930s in due course so hopefully plenty to look forward to! The really good news is that we know there will be a two hour Christmas Special in 2012 and although a fourth series has not yet been announced it will be very surprising if it does not follow.	5.0	Downton Abbey Series 3 - Great Entertainment	2012-11-06	8	6	2

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A6WZVL0SRQAPY	Brian Driver	"NOTE: Though I am NOT happy, I will NOT include any SPOILERS!!I am notifying all who care that I am sincerely thinking of giving up this series.There are times that great fiction -- which should of course be prone to the ""rules"" of life on this planet -- must present the negative side of life: tragedy included.But there are times that works of fiction deliberately manipulate emotions in what I consider to be an ATTENTION-GETTING END-OF-SEASON RATINGS MANEUVER, and this thoroughly ticks me off.I will not discuss the events that characterized the last few episodes of this season, but I will say this: ENOUGH ALREADY, DOWNTON ABBEY!As the thousands of people who have supplied Amazon ratings have attested, this has been until recently a delightful series that immersed us not only in the aristocratic lifestyle of the privileged, but also explored the matters that concerned those that served them.In addition, DA also clothed itself in turn-of-the-century historical themes that characterized the era, letting us see the impact of major events like the Great War as well as the equally powerful influences as influenza, the proliferation of telephones and the rise of Women's Suffrage.In this manner the series remained topical and true to the era.But toward the end of this season I have begun to feel manipulated through contrived rating-grabbers, and it has really made me question whether I want to continue watching this series.I know that ratings matter, and it's important that a public TV station gain influence on those with deep pockets and pocketbooks, but I'm just about done with the sensationalized events of late.Why not an earthquake that swallows the town?  Why not have John Bates run away to become a barnstorming pilot?  Why not have Lady Grantham swept away by an alluring Sheik of Araby?Right!  These would be absurd attempts to control the emotions of your viewers.  Is this series becoming ""DA-llas""?I'm glad we're on break...I need some time to consider if I'm coming back."	3.0	I Am Seriously Downton CR-abbey	2013-02-20	5	4	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A17OTW6CEFLFAK	"Britt Olinder-Stevens ""O-S"""	Such attention to detail is put into the making of this show, I feel almost a part of each of character's life and advocate for every one of them. The only critique I have is in the form of a question: Why was this season so short?! Season one had three discs, but two had six. I thought, if anything, three would be as long as two. But buy this show! If you like English drama that pays attention to historical detail in reference to time, technology, and social class where everything is on the verge of monumental change, then this show is for you! The writing is fantastic. Even when you are a part of the dramatic irony and are the witness to a trajedy at the hand of a villian, you find yourself in their corner as well (at least when they're a member of the house). I find it amazing the level of loyalty I feel for these characters. My feelings are so strong that I am truly disappointed when I find out anything about the actors in real life. That may seem silly, but Downton is such a world of its own, I hate to have any alternate &#34;reality&#34; spoil it. If you are able, I absolutely recommend watching Season 1-3 in quick succession (i.e. one per night) and avoid ALL sppoilers. I predict that you will find this show as riveting as I have, if you like anything of this genre. Enjoy!	5.0	Downton Abbey is a fantastic show!	2013-02-04	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A13R5E9EESNUMH	Bruce Moore	As the war ends, and the new decade arrives, it is interesting to witness the effects of change on both the upstairs and downstairs environs.  Surprisingly, the ability to cope with the changes, and move forward came from some of those whom you would not have expected to accept change.  It was especially interesting to watch the house staff, and how they adapted to changing situations, some more than others.  Behind it all, Carson was the anchor who, as always, provided stability and order.  The events at the end of the season cast a pall over the family, as well as the future of Downton, itself.	5.0	End of season surprise was a shocker	2014-01-15	0	0	0

I was hooked after the first episode. There are compelling storylines for all the characters, nobility and servants alike. The Dowager Countess and her one liners are a hoot!

Despite the heavily &#34;down&#34; tone to this season, we are glued to every episode. The costumes are fantastic (I want Lady Mary's wardrobe! BTW this is buster300's wife writing the review!) The stories touch upon numerous aspects of this historical period (Irish situation, women's burgeoning rights, class issues, etc.) to give the show breadth and interest. The humanity of all the characters is readily felt, so they are never simply good or evil (altho O'Brien may be the exception to that).

Wrong move, regardless if the Actor was going on to do other things, they should have handled it differently, sending him off to India/New York and do some pick up shots every now and then or they could have replaced him with another actor, or put him in a coma until they decided what to do - killing Matthew off was just wrong.

Maybe it's the great acting, or the interesting time period(s) in which the tale takes place. It could quite possibly be the idea of viewing what the life of the privileged was like, with the ups & downs that the family has to go through and the realistic storyline that is portrayed.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1M767WS7CO591	cailebotte	I just received the blu ray I purchased on amazon in the US featuring the UK version of the show, which is the only version available. We watched episode 6 on the blu ray just as it was airing on tv here in the US. We happened to see the episode on TV after we saw it on blu ray and were shocked to discover that the blu ray did not include key moments compared to what was shown on television. For instance, there's a key scene in which Mrs O'Brian tells Thomas that the new valet has a crush on him, leading him on. This scene is not in the episode on the blu ray. In addition, there are several moments of dialogue missing from other scenes. Consequently, DO NOT WATCH THE BLU RAY BELIEVING YOU'RE SEEING THE FULL VERSION. I will not see the next episodes on blu ray because I'm certain I will be missing key moments. My guess is that in the UK they have commercials and they need shorter episodes than in the US, where the series airs with no commercial interruption. In summary, unless there's an American version of the show in blu ray coming up, which I doubt, I recommend that you watch the show live on television in the US and you don't buy this UK version now on sale in amazon.	1.0	BEWARE - THIS BLU RAY IS AN EDITED, SHORTENED VERSION OF WHAT'S SHOWN ON U.S. TELEVISION	2013-02-03	77	62	15

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2LL5H2MI66L21	"Capricious Star ""Capricious Star"""	I have been watching the first 2 Seasons of Downton Abbey on Amazon Instant Videos.  With Amazon Prime, those were free.  I  loved every moment.  So much so, I watched each episode more than once.  When my husband heard from a friend how much they were enjoying it, he came home and suggested we start watching.  I didn't want to discourage him, so I just said yes and didn't tell him until almost the last episode of the 2nd season, once I knew he was hooked.Now, full disclosure, Amazon requests that you review items you have ordered even if a person would know that only one episode of Season 3 has aired and I cannot possibly review the entire season.  But the first episode did not disappoint.That is all I will say, because, if you haven't watched it, I don't want to spoil any of it for you. PBS did a special on Highclere Castle where the series is filmed and, so far, I cannot see that this is added to the Season 3 extras.Between the amazing sets, the costumes, the many characters and plots / subplots.  It is worth watching multiple times for enjoyment and to clarify details that may have been missed during the first viewing.The first episode was great and I am looking forward to subsequent episodes.  It looks like the entire Season is set for DVD release at the end of January, so I am hoping that the Instant Video (which we gladly pay for in the hope that we can watch the entire Season (probably more than once)on our own schedule once the entire season is released.Definitely worth watching, more than once.

Most all of the stories are compelling and keep the momentum of the series moving along with interesting twists that keep my interest piqued.  Though I won't give it away, the only disappointment I've had is the Season 3 ending, which was predictable given what I've read about a certain cast member's imminent departure, but is a shame both from the prospect of the loss of the character as well as the way it was handled.	5.0	Excellent writing, acting, costumes, editing, music, and videography	2013-02-04	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ABCRD7W83UWUL	Carey Baldwin	The spoiler free part of this review is that this is the same fantastic series with a group of characters we still love. Every detail of their all-too-human lives had me riveted to the screen as usual. Also worth noting is that I enjoyed the fact that Thomas' sexuality is revisited in this season in a quite interesting way, adding even more depth to his character as well as to the characters of those who must react to his behavior. It's hard for me to give only three stars to a series I love, and I definitely will continue to watch the series, but...I am growing tired of the &#34;We're rich!&#34; &#34;We've lost everything!&#34; &#34;We're rich!&#34; &#34;We've lost everything!&#34; &#34;We're rich again!&#34; story line, always accomplished by Deus Ex Machina. Get a real plot, already. Great characters - you've already got. But that's not a reason to overlook good storytelling.Now for the real SPOILER so stop reading here if you don't want to know. ********************************************While I didn't like the choice made to have Sybil die in childbirth, that alone wouldn't have knocked this season down to three stars for me. But, I absolutely hated the choice that was made to have Matthew's character apparently die. I can only hope that the writer rethinks this choice before next season, as he did leave the possibility open that Matthew survives his accident. It's not because I love Matthew and don't want to see him go, although I do. It's because it is a disservice to the story. Matthew is as close to a &#34;hero&#34; as anyone is this series. Following his character and his fortunes is a significant reason people watch the show. The story should revolve around characters and plot, not actors. So if an actor decides to take a hike, the writer, in my opinion, should find a way to carry on with the story. There are many ways to handle an actor's exit, other than killing off his character in the story. If a character's death is integral to the plot and accomplishes something important, then I do not object. But when the death occurs randomly, in the service of an actor's career choice, I'm against it. The audience is interested in the character, not the actor. Sybil's death already seemed random and did not advance the plot. Now Matthew dies, also in a random act? The writer could have and should have done better. I'm tired of windfall inheritances and car accidents driving the series.	3.0	Still Riveting But...	2013-02-22	4	3	1

I always say ""if you have to stoop to cheap tricks to finish a script, it won't be worth much. That's how I feel about season 3. I adored this series. I have never been so utterly in love with a tv series before - even a Masterpiece Theater series.I don't know what the writer was thinking. After you load so much sickness, pain, morbid heartbreak and brutal, untimely death into a script, after awhile it gets laughable. I will not watch this program in the future.

I wasn't sure watching it on such a small screen would be as engrossing as on a large screen, but it was. The series itself is, for me, the best thing on television and of course I can hardly bear the thought of having to wait months and months to learn what happens next - and no, I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, other than to say there appears to be no end for new beginnings.

The only reason I have to give it a 4-Star rating is that I did not understand how difficult it would be for me to understand the King's English...instead of the American version.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A9M5S9XM72FQG	"Caroline Stoebuck ""World Traveller"""	Overall I love Downton Abbey Series 3 but must death be so prevalent?  I loved the mix of the main characters upstairs and downstairs but now they are leaving one by one.  It was good to see that they dealt with &#34;taboo&#34; subjects realistically for today's times but with the rules of the day in the 1920s.  I love the costumes and scenery.  It will be interesting to see if Series 4 includes the Great Depression and the growing of the next generation of Sybil (granddaughter) and George, and that Edith finally find lasting love and if Mary shows more of her independent nature again.  I hope that there will be many more series with the Crawley family and the changing times of the aristocracy.	5.0	Three Deaths in One Series!	2013-03-24	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AW3VZ5O895LRK	"carol irvin ""carol irvin"""	This show is a huge family saga and historical romance.  I always think I will resist being pulled into this world. Every single time after the first episode, I am once again a DA addict. Just try pulling me away!Right off the top, let me get something off my chest.  I THINK BATES IS GUILTY. Am I the only one to think that way? I  just do not see his late wife, a character who lived for revenge, killing herself, which is the only alternative. I guess you could argue that this was a primo act of revenge but she was doing fabulously well against Bates and Anna revenge wise with limitless prospects for further success. Why end such a pleasurable experience which she could watch endlessly unfold?  She was already making them absolutely miserable! If it turns out she was a suicide, I think it is the only misstep the writers made. So this remains a big plot element in season three downstairs with Anna still trying to exonerate him.Upstairs we have the wedding for Matthew and Lady Mary with further quarrels leading them all the way to the altar.  These two will not have a staid marriage and that is all to the good. Sybil is present with Tom and will be shortly delivering her baby. Hugh Bonneville, the lord and master of the abbey, is again beset on all sides.  He makes many mistakes based on his aristocratic viewpoint of the world.  At heart this is the prime problem for all of these people, they grew up in an aristocracy and the aristocracy is precisely what is no longer needed in post world war one England.But the best characters are the three older women, the matriarchs of all other characters.  These are the dowager countess, played wonderfully by Maggie Smith, Matthew's mother, and Shirley MacLaine as the present countess's American mother. You would think the dowager countess would be a complete anachronism with the future being firmly represented by the other two matriarchs.  However, as the power behind the throne, Smith is incredible.  There is always power behind the throne and it is often a woman who has it.  Smith thus continues to be a major delight.As usual, I am anxiously awaiting the next episode.  sigh.....	5.0	I always start off thinking i won't like it and then get hooked anew	2012-10-17	47	38	9

Downton Abbey is so well produced and the acting is outstanding.  The story also gives one a look into the British class system and how it evolved after the First World War much to the chagrine of some of the priviledged class in the story.  Fascinating and so worthwhile.  I highly recommend the series.  Note: I watched the first two seasons on my Kindle for free as an Amazon Prime member as I just heard of the series over the holidays.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A12PR3Z8DF8V5J	Cate E.	Instantly hooked at the first headline of the Titanic in the initial episode, I, in the company of many no doubt, inhaled every episode like it was the drug to solve all my personal problems. Addict I became, intensely interested in my favorite characters through three seasons of appalling events,servant gossip, that ever-nastalgic and alluring British aristocratic lifestyle, and of course the seductive tension between the characters Mary and Matthew. However, alarmingly and without warning, Season 3 left me alone in a hollow room of irritation, possibly akin to that of an addict's withdrawal. As the blood trickled down the cheek of the now-deceased Matthew, 90% of the reason I love Downton Abbey suddenly vanished. The vacuum left by Mary's counterpart demands more than the young (albeit strikingly handsome) Branson can deliver, because we simply have not connected with him at the level we did Matthew. (However, on second thought, a torn, rain-soaked white shirt, a day's growth and perhaps a broken leg might add a new level of connection, but I digress. Would still be a great scene, though.) What does Season Four promise? Sigh. The final episode of Three set the stage for the (yawn) predictable nod toward Thomas' sexual orientation as the object of his affection will most certainly realize that he is, after all, not straight. My favorite valet might actually admit to sweet Anna that he did, in fact, murder his late ex. Will Branson turn the Abbey around and implement his late brother-in-law's controversial ideas? My keenest longing is to return to the comfy easy chair with my kindle fire and glass of red in the blessed quiet hours of night, curling up for my fix, and immerse myself in the English lilt of yesteryear-as has been my cherished practice. I am reluctant to hope that the next season of Downton Abbey will deliver the goods. Though I will it to be so. After all, I AM a junkie.	4.0	Seasons 1-3 Delivered! Will season 4?	2013-03-10	1	1	0

(*See my review of Season 2 for why I missed the season)  I knew the ending.  Even so, I enjoyed every bit of the build up to the end of the series.

We lost 2 great actors, ( I don't want to give away the story) Thank God they were able to keep the Downton Abbey entertaining with the remaining actors and moved everything along with great zest and suspense for the upcoming season 4. I cannot believe how addicted I have become to this series, the acting so suberb,  you tend to believe these people and their lives really exsist. I really enjoy the dowager and her zings, priceless!

Julian Fellowes has a flair for life in the Great Houses at the turn of the 19th century, as he demonstrated with his amazing film Gosford Park. I would watch any of his work.

Before this series the return of Matthew in the middle of the concert in the second series had been the soapiest but the last moments of the new series are pure soap.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AZVEPWRYOFBX5	Charity Bishop	"After being criticized for his ""soapy"" second season of the British television series, Julian Fellowes takes us back to a much slower pace in Downton, full of the lovely little things that made the first season so delightful... and then crushes us.Criticisms of this series' predictability and tired plot twists notwithstanding, this season is less problematic with its twists than previous ones. But we still can't escape the never-ending drudgery of poor Edith, who is thwarted at every turn. I sincerely hope the writer gives her a break someday! Just when one possibility of future happiness turns up, Fellowes throws in a plot twist right out of a Bronte novel to further complicate her life. There's also a redundancy and lack of clarity in certain plot twists (such as Anna's sudden realization of Vera Bates' motives, which were obvious to us all last season). But it's always funny, always charming, and always romantic... even if it does make us cry buckets of tears before the season is out. It threatens to take one character from us, only to deviate into two shocking, unexpected deaths in a later episode.As always, the acting is magnificent and this season there's a lot to work with emotionally, from a death to near financial disaster and the arrival of a newborn to Downton. Maggie Smith is given all the best lines but the flirtations between Matthew and Mary are delightful to watch. In fact, there's one sneaked kiss in the first episode that is particularly fun. BUT, frankly, the last two minutes of this series are the most depressing I've ever seen. It ruined my Christmas, and have convinced me not only never to watch that episode again, but not to buy any of the seasons beyond this one. Pack the hankies, fans... you'll need them."	5.0	A Delightful Third Season	2012-11-13	4	3	1

Maybe just as well that I ignored the show for its first four seasons, because I've been binge-watching over the past weeks. I haven't been hooked on a network series in more years than I can remember, but this is no ordinary series. I've grown to know and love most of the characters, and loathe a few; teared up over the loss of some, and quietly cheered when one of the minor characters exacted well-deserved revenge on another.The setting for this program is simply impressive. Love much of the camerawork, too, although I'm betting that most viewers won't realize why they feel like they're walking into the abbey along with visitors during the opening sequences of many episodes.I'll admit it: I love this program, and hope it will continue for many more seasons.	5.0	Don't let the title scare you off!	2014-03-29	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AIEGFUEPPB72A	Charlotte W Chamberlain	Cora's mother is depicted as the tacky American. Actually, wealthy New Yorkers of this period were refined and well bred.The characters die off because the actors do not renew their contracts. They also are bored. The script begins to fall apart .

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AKQ5OO6OS6I58	Chaz	I watched Season 3 just long enough to mash the &#34;back&#34; button on my remote after seeing how drastically the cinematography went downhill. I don't know if they have a different director of photography, or just decided to shoot the next season on smartphones, but something happened, and the production quality took a turn for the &#34;soap-opera&#34;. Seasons 1 and 2 were ok and watchable because the photography was not distractingly bad. The plot of this show is not so engaging that I will sit through subpar production. I enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 quite well. Season 3 does not exist as far as I'm concerned. Quite a shame.	1.0	Does not compare to season 1 or 2	2013-07-11	3	2	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1ZZ8GN34LOI18	Chris McClure	I heard about this program over dinner on Christmas and watched an episode on DVD.  Like a speckled trout in a Scottish stream I was hooked.  Now I am caught up on the story and just killing time until January 5, 2014 at nine o'clock in the evening.  I am really hoping that Benny Hill shows up at the Abbey for dinner but that is really the only plot suggestion I have.  Beyond that everything is perfect.  Oh yeah, the costumes are to die for. Also, they ought to get a different color car to drive past the London walkup during the transitions.  Anyone else notice that?  Probably a product of watching thirty something episodes in three days.  You get to know the cars.  In Detroit you gotta' know the pies.  At Downton Abbey you gotta' know the cars.I loved it.  No really, I did!Which actor gets the most residuals?  Let me know please.  it should be the Butler.Oh the product streamed as smoothly as a Scottish brook in the early spring sunshine.	5.0	Classiest Soap Opera on Record, and British to Boot.	2014-01-02	0	0	0

I still love the show even though there were major ups and downs this season. I think they feel much more intense because after watching the show for several seasons, I feel attached to some of the characters and plot lines. Reflecting on previous seasons, there were dramatic plot twists that seemed part of Downton so I guess the biggies on season 3 are still in tune with the other seasons.Overall, I am interested to see what will happen in season 4 so ultimately the show is still a success!	4.0	Still A Favorite	2013-02-21	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A200WZNBX1JNT3	Cinema Fan	I was listening to a radio talk show host talk about watching this.  I decided to try to try it.  Wound up watching two full seasons in one weekend that is how addicting it is.  Even if you take away the beautiful sets and scenery, the actors who make you feel their every emotion and the brilliant writing, it is worth watching just to find out what Maggie Smith will say next!!  No one else could have come close to playing the part as she does.	4.0	And the saga continues	2013-10-20	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A13S25YAUVTB98	CinemaPete	"I would have given this version of Season 3 5 stars but:  My rating is not a reflection on the movie content but with the packaging which includes commercials.  I also have seasons 1 and 2 that I purchased directly from the UK which are region free and those disks do not have annoying and time-wasting commercials on them and instead go promptly to the main menu.  This season 3 put out with the PBS logo on it was release here in the US has at least two commercials for PBS - it's like watching the series on television with the commercials.  However, you can fast-forward to the main menu to select the episodes.  However, I will not purchase season 4 when it becomes available from the US/PBS version for the same reason that it will most likely have commercial messages in it.  Seek out the UK version instead if that matters to you. I think it's a bit arrogant on the part of PBS (and other movie studios as well), to insert commercials into a Blu-ray or DVD.  After all, one purchases movies on Blu-ray and DVD not just for the quality and convenience but for the absence of time-wasting and annoying commercials.As for the actual season 3 (and 1 and 2) of Downton Abbey, well, it's ""simply fabulous"" as Thurston Howell III (from the 70's TV series ""Gilligan's Island"", played by Jim Baccus) would say in his Dink accent, and if you've seen seasons 1 and 2 you'll not want to miss season 3.  I can't wait for season 4.  The end of season 3 was simply riveting.One gets a true sense of what it must have been like to be part of a family of Lords around the turn of the 19th century in England and to have been brought up with the attendant privileges of such a station in life there.If I were rating just the production of Downton Abbey it would get a 10 on a scale of 1 to 5 - it's that good; actors, acting, scenery, costumes, dialog, filming, character development, and especially the filming.  After the 2nd or 3rd episode you'll be hooked."	3.0	Wonderful, But Why PBS ADs ???	2013-03-17	1	1	0

I wouldn't have given the story/drama  a minute.I thought the story line was way short of the &#34;MASTERPIECE&#34; as titled.I  sometimes wondered how the actors took the series seriously.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2A2YGCSWWAF13	Classics Collector	Probably little to say here that hasn't been said, highly recommended it for its breadth of story and fine portrayals.  The HD aspect of it is genuine, the clarity of color and detail are brilliant.Downton Abbey's sucess in the US is well documented and for all its depictions of vintage British class discrepancies its true measure of fascination for it are the storyline and interpersonal relationships.At the heart of it are how rapid social change takes place: who adapts and who doesn't?  The time here is pre and post WWI but, like Gone With The Wind, it could be about any modern era where a European based social structure goes topsy turvy. We observe the genteel nature of certain daily ritual that so obviously represents an imperialist attitude that doesn't serve all, yet, they are strangely nostalgic and idealistic. Even many of the servants say as much.But a nice shell game is being played out here between beauty and ugliness, with a seemingly slow pace depicting idle pleasure mixed with major undercurrents of displeasure, anger, sadness and bitterness.  Upstairs, downstairs, and where the twain shall meet. Human drama all the time...It's quite well done.	5.0	A shell game of a story paced brilliantly	2014-01-20	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AE2KCASMQPMO	"C. Meja ""CMM"""	What starts to throw me off in the series is the tendency to make it all ok. Bad stuff happens because accidents happen (and the season finale is the most representative moment of this), but conflicts between characters seem to be less and less developed, and more thrown towards petty little discussions that eventually amount to no actual plot development. Granny is still the most interesting character in the show for me... and this is very telling as well, since she is the one who seems to have no arc of herself, rather, she seems to intervene in other plots to solve them.It was mostly a disappointing season, but the way things are set up at the end are promising, unless writing keeps taking the show towards this &#34;all is well between good people&#34;, and keeps avoiding fissures within the house.	3.0	All is well?	2013-08-14	0	0	0

I began watching season 3 on PBS, but ordered the DVD set to be delivered upon release, anxious to watch the episodes in their entirety.  Well, not only is it not the &#34;full UK edition&#34;, it's not even the full US edition!  I compared one episode that I had recoreded from PBS to the episode on DVD, and found there to be more than 10 minutes of footage missing on the DVD!I don't know what the &#34;game&#34; is.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A23UB49EG29MVT	Commenter77	Never before has the clash of cultures and times played such an integral part, as the family is beginning to show division between those willing to adjust to change and those staunchly holding onto the old ways, even between spouses.  Dear Mrs. Levinson, Cora's mother, serves here to boldly state the issue.  The idealists/diehards emerge as the Dowager Countess, Lord Grantham, Lady Mary and Mr. Carson. Their position, though sympathetic due to attachment to their characters, is an increasingly difficult one to defend.The big changes in the opening Series 3 episode are the financial loss of the family and the introduction of Cora's mother coming for the wedding, with that blunt and indomitable personality.  To my viewing, she definitely daunts the Dowager, trumping her in audacity in nearly every encounter.  No doubt the financial vulnerability plays a strong part in that. It may be a case of whether you prefer blunt over acidity or vice versa.The attachment between Matthew and Mary was never so poignant as revealed in the night before wedding sequence at Mary's bedroom door.  Matthew is so richly warm as he affirms his love and repeats to Mary the words from Tom Branson that he could not be content in life without her, regardless of their disagreement.  So effective.The mystery still holds concerning Bates, as a darker side is showing up with his cell mate.  Since he has been so insistent in not revealing things to shield others in the past, perhaps that is still the case. I wouldn't be surprised if Anna's probings provide necessary evidence and we find that again, he has been acting in honor by not revealing something that could have cleared him.  As to his cell mate, the pressure of his circumstances could well account for his unwillingness to take anything off someone he doesn't have to.  A lot of good people believe in his character.This episode as seen on PBS severely breaks the smooth transition of story lines previously experienced, making a complete UK edition mandatory.  Hopefully, there will be help in the very rapid moving from one story line to the next, as presently it is a bit of a whiplash at times.  One is trying to digest what was just presented, but is immediately being thrown into another diverse and complicated scenario.  Before, the difference in the broadcast and full version was an abrupt introduction of a character without the lead up in the full edition, but now it is more a hurl from one venue to another, especially in the latter part.It will be very interesting to see how this central theme of change plays out among the parties, along with the various fates hanging in the balance and old scores to be settled.	5.0	Clash of Cultures	2013-01-07	1	1	0

Since I hadn't heard any rumors about the ending of season 3, I was NOT prepared for it at all and it really upset me.  But regardless of my feelings of loss, which I think came because I was able to watch the entire season in one day, I think season three was fantastic.  I like the series a lot and am anxious for Amazon Prime to give us access to Season 4.	5.0	I give it five stars but I'm not happy with it.	2014-03-06	0	0	0

(I hope that Dan Stevens will forever be haunted by the knowledge that he broke the hearts of millions of fans).In the past, there were scenes in the Dvd's that were not shown on the television version. That does not appear to be the case this time. All the episodes are one hour instead of an hour and a half; nevertheless, all were great.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2ZGZ964L02HKB	Craig	Excellent! Subtly and nuanced acting are the hallmarks of this series. I'd suggest that young people view this to experience acting at a sophisticated, well-schooled level;  in contrast to standard television fare. When I say sophisticated, I do not mean because the plot line centers around a upper class family. IT IS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE ACTING PERFORMANCES. Television can do so much better that &#34;The Housewives of ...........&#34;. It is one thing to argue this case and  quite another thing to experience the differences. Indeed, if you've never experienced excellence, then junk can pass as good.	5.0	The acting is of the first order; so much conveyed via subtly and nuance.	2013-11-25	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1GJRO44O1NFRZ	CR (Gus) Manning	As Season Three ends, maybe it is getting a little bit soapy, but it still offers some of the best character portraits ever seen on TV.  British Drama has always been based on character and a feel for how language can demonstrate character.  Americans have a lot of character, but American screen writers have forgotten how to demonstrate it through speech.  Recently, we inadvertently watched an episode of I Claudius (highly-regarded BBC series about a Roman emporer's family), and observed that the Downton menial servants seem to demonstrate more character on a daily basis than the Emperor Augustus.	5.0	Simply the Best TV has To Offer	2014-01-03	0	0	0

Of course, I will admit that I was a history major.  Downton Abbey is one of those well written pieces that does not alter history and reports it in a palatable manner easy for the non history lover to digest, an art developed by Mitchner.  I undertand that American television, NBC I think, has hired the DA writer to put together a similar saga based in early 1900s New York.  If that interests you, you might want to watch The Age Innocence, starring Daniel Day Lewis and based on the book by Edith Wharton.	5.0	Super writing, acting, and deivery of history.	2012-11-29	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2O8W7NXBZFVU2	DA	We love Downton Abbey and strongly recommend the series to one and all.What I don't recommend is that you buy/download the Amazon version.  We missed episode 1 of series 3 on our DVR and decided to download it from Amazon.  The version they showed was notably different from the other shows and it didn't exactly fit in some ways.  Come to learn, after the fact, that the Amazon version of episode 1 is only 1 hour 7 minutes long while the official PBS version is 1 hour 52 minutes.  If you care about Downton Abbey I strongly recommend that you look elsewhere for your media lest you, like us, are forever wondering what happened in the missing 45 minutes.	1.0	Amazon's Downton Videos are Heavily Edited!	2013-04-01	1	1	0

Signing up for Prime on Amazon was totally worth it just to be able to watch all of the Downton Abbey Seasons! I absolutely love watching this show and following the characters thru the twists and turns of the early 20th century in England. It embodies everything a good drama should have, at times it's funny, sad, touching, thought provoking, amusing, and it leaves you wanting more.It's also something that the whole family can watch without being embarrassed in front of your kids or having to turn the channel.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A18SWXM8YUKZQI	David Bartz	I missed out on Downton Abbey,  and am a recent convert.  I started watching it because my wife loves some of the British classics, like Pride and Prejudice, etc.  I soon was enthralled with the ins and outs of the life at Downton, and the accurate historical aspects of the show.  Lastly, though it is a true drama, it is threaded with that ever so funny British humor, which my wife and I love.If you try it for a few episodes, you will get hooked and brought into the lives of some wonderfully developed characters.  I purchased the first six episodes of Season 3, so that my wife and I may be caught up into the present of the lives of the characters of Downton Abbey.I highly recommend this series, if you can't tell.	5.0	One (if not the) best show on television!	2014-02-08	1	1	0
1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3SPWPTUO5ZM26	David B. Battin	This is such a good story and I enjoy the period in which it is set very much. The depiction of a traditional way of life for the landed gentry in England giving way to more modern patterns of life is fascinating.  I can't evaluate the historical accuracy of much of what is depicted but I think within general historical parameters it is a good attempt.  The story is rich in human struggle, failure, recovery and sometimes success.  The intricate relationships between the servants and the served are worth some serious consideration.  If serious consideration is too much work on a given evening watching can just be fun.	5.0	What could be more fun.?	2014-04-12	0	0	0

And there have been times when I have smiled, or even been touched by an episode. But that said, DA is not afraid to retread over some of the most tired soap opera chestnuts to move its story from one episode to the next. There are some reasons to watch it--Maggie Smith's delivery, Thomas' struggles and some insight into class, activism and feminism between the wars come to mind.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2Z7N9FSPBO11K	David	"I'm stunned that the DVD has omitted scenes from the broadcast version shown in the United States.  As several reviewers have noted, in Part 6 (which was episode 5 shown in the states, since the USA broadcast combined Parts 1 and 2 from the DVD into a single episode), the crucial scene where Mrs. O'Brien tells Thomas how much the new footman James has taken a liking to him is NOT on the DVD.  Another example is in Part 4 (episode 3 in the states)where Daisy tells Mr. Mason that she is interested in another footman (Alfred), but that scene is omitted in the DVD although it is shown in the TV episode.  I'm fairly certain other scenes have been omitted since each part on the DVD runs shorter than the episode that was shown on TV.  I was not a regular viewer of the series until I purchased the DVD of seasons 1 and 2, and I watched all the episodes over a month's time so I could be prepared for season 3.  I was completely enthralled by the series and I eagerly looked forward to the new season.  But now I am extremely disappointed by the DVDs, and I wonder how much I missed by not watching the series on TV.  The DVDs are promoted by PBS, and the network should be embarrassed that the DVDs show edited episodes.  Also shame should go to Amazon for promoting the DVD as the ""uncut"" UK version.  So I'll now only use my DVR to watch the remaining episodes."	1.0	The DVD is NOT the uncut UK broadcast version as promoted by Amazon.	2013-02-08	11	10	1

After watching he stated it was great!  I then received a letter from Amazon Prime stating I was not using (or aware) of the additional options available through Amazon Prime; one being movies,TV series, etc.  Since we do have a Smart TV, I have taken advantage of this option, and we have started Downton Abbey from season 1 and we are totally hooked on it.  Plus the fact of the immense availability of instant video and movie options.  We have watched as many as 5 episodes of Downton Abbey in one sitting, and can't wait for more time for more episodes!!!

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1UKW34190DP5S	"dealsearcher1108 ""straightup"""	Season 3 of this series is the best of all.  The storyline is powerful and moving.  The cast is incredible. This ensemble of actors is second to none.  From starring roles to the most minor of characters, each actor inhabits his or her character with such skill and talent, that it's hard to believe the characters aren't real, breathing human beings from the early 20th century.  I'm a big Maggie Smith fan so I'm not surprised that she is magnificent as the dowager countess, after all she's not Dame Maggie Smith for nothing, but every other actor in this cast also gives a sensitive, nuanced performance in every episode.Of course, none of this would be possible without some of the best writing on television.  From storyline to dialogue to character development to historical detail, the writing makes it seem that not a word is out of place.  Unlike some other multi-episode family sagas of the past TV seasons, there is nothing sprawling or extraneous about the way the story evolves.  Tight direction and editing make certain each episode flows smoothly and effortlessly.  Add to that , a beautiful setting, great production values and costume design and you have the makings of one of the finest series ever seen on television.If you are not watching this series, you are missing out on something truly special.	5.0	It Just Gets Better	2013-10-25	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AYOFDYXBSF01V	Debbie L. Barker	It is a compelling story that stays with one long after the last episode.  The story and the acting are very well done.  I'm looking forward to the next season, certainly.The only disappointment I could voice about the series is that it was clearly used as a platform for airing some modern moral views that were not, to my understanding, representative of that day.  These views came out, briefly in the first and third seasons, and while reprehensible to me, they did not spoil the story at large....for me as an adult.  However, I would not recommend those episodes, in particular, for young audiences because of them.  In truth, there are several more &#34;adult&#34; episodes I would not have my children watch, good and appropriate as the series, as a whole, is.	5.0	Over all well done adult series	2013-02-09	1	1	0

It is very well written in British fashion with a dry wit, which can be off-putting to a large segment of American audiences who expect mindless action and corny dialogue and are lost on subtlty.  It's visually stunning with amazing scenery, costuming, and furnishings.  Watching the dynamics of both upstairs and down, you get pulled in and the feeling you're part of the household.

That said, personally I really dislike how so many movies and shows have to go with a Greek Tragedy model these days and some really good characters have to &#34;die&#34; (though I realize some of the actors and actresses are reported as saying they asked to leave the show...hmm, I wonder why so many)?  That's my only critique really - but the acting is superb almost all the time and I enjoy the rich fodder of subjects that can be historically portrayed, explored and put on display to understand all the radical life style and changes that societies underwent thru the first few decades of the 20th century.

What an amazing show!  The characters are mesmerizing, the storyline is fascinating, the scenery is gorgeous! This show shows the differences in the classes in England in the early 1900 s.  The upper class is so excessive in every way! But so proud of their heritage and lifestyle.  They find it difficult to move ahead with the changes after WW 1, changes  including a declining fortune and increasing women's lib. I was so impressed by the lower class, the staff at Downton abbey. There are classes among the lower class! The butler lords it over the others, they even stand up when he enters the room! Each staff member has his particular job and he/she works  so hard to move up in the ranks. Then there is interdependence between the two classes, each needing the other. This is an amazing show. I would give it 10 stars!	5.0	Amazing!	2014-02-21	0	0	0

Maggie Smith is wonderful, the rest of the cast is very goAnd, of course, the scenery and costumes are a large part of the appeal of a period piece.

The season finale was devastating but presents the audience with a new vision of the future and reality of the ordinary person's life.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1M2L89Q3S540W	"Diane L. Thompson ""magicmom"""	In the real world, people are born, fall in love, marry, and die according to their stars and not by the exigencies of the actors. The beauty of Downton Abbey is you feel the randomness of life within their best laid plans. Being a breast cancer survivor, I appreciated the glimpse into how that situation may have played out in the early years of the 20th century. Having a gay sister and a brother, also gay, who died of AIDs, I very much appreciated how far we have come. And, being a hopeless romantic, I appreciate the restrained beauty of the many interactions, both platonic and amorous. But most of all, I love watching Maggie Smith chew up the scenery, whether riding in the back of the limo or walking across the room after the death of her granddaughter.

But I thoroughly enjoyed it. After binge watching all four seasons I had a bit of separation anxiety. Love the characters, most especially, Mrs. Hughes, Ms Patmore, Anna, Daisy, Bates and Mr. Carson, as stuffy as he is he's an honorable man. I also enjoyed the upstairs characters, especially, Cybil, Branson, Edith and oh that wonderful Matthew. I do love Maggie Smith in any role and Mrs. Crawley, Matthews mom is also a big favorite.

It follows the characters of this household  going through the vicissitudes of country life following the economic woes of  post-WWI England, and the social changes that begin to slowly blur the lines between the landed gentry and the servant class.  Also it touches on the Irish &#34;troubles&#34;, women's rights, and the re-structuring of the tenant farmers' contributions to the estate of Downton Abbey,  We watch as each class of persons reacts to the social, economic, and moral changes brought on by the  aftermath of a world war..I highly recommend everyone to watch this series....even those who have difficulty understanding the King's English.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1P77JG6PMRRPK	Divascribe	The third season of Downton Abbey, which takes place in the early 1920s, has some good times -- chief amongst those Matthew and Mary's long-awaited wedding -- and some very bad times indeed, which I won't go into here. The acting continues to be good and I agree with most of the plot points, but of course there are a couple of really bad situations that I don't want to give away but that most people have probably heard about anyway. The ending of this season was far darker than that of season two, so I'm hoping there are happier times ahead in season four.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A32UIU20HTSM0T	DIY Coffey	This is a good choice if you're looking for a new series with your wife/husband.  Both my wife and I enjoyed watching this very much.  The acting and production quality are great and they do a good job of taking you into that time period.  It's for adults not kids, but it is something that will appeal to the young and old adults alike.  At times it's fun and at times it's sad.I still give it 5 starts, but there is one bad thing I can say about this series - the ending was very disappointing and didn't really fit with the rest of the show (Don't worry, not a spoiler). Some comments from the writers suggest it's some sort of British tradition and we have seen similar things on other British shows. I speculate that it has more to do with the personal careers of the writers than it does on the story - so it unfortunately leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.  So either don't watch the final episode, or take it with a very large grain of salt.  Maybe even just think of your own alternative ending before you watch the final episode and try to envision that when you get mad at the show :)Happy Watching!	5.0	Good for Couples	2014-01-09	0	0	0

Mr. Fellowes, creator and writer, is a mastermind using actors/characters as delicate pieces in an exquisite Masterpiece. After viewing a special on Manor of Castles&#8221; which focused on Highclere Castle the filming location of show and show&#8217;s title &#8220;Downton Abbey, I realized this was a must-see PBS Masterpiece Classic. Amazon Prime Members- Kindle owners, as stated in &#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221; are of the &#8220;privileged,&#8221; I was able to watch all three seasons for &#8220;FREE!&#8221;During winter break was spent watching all three season , Mr. Fellows much like Hitchcock  can be  deliciously evil to his characters, as well as to his audience. He manages to touch on every subject from breast cancer to homosexuality. As he has Mr. Carson, the Head Butler state when the suggestion of firing Mr. Barrows for being open about his sexuality, &#8220;I can&#8217;t fire the poor creature for being born that way.&#8221; Throughout this series Mr. Fellows manages to convince &#8220;Lady and Gentlemen Viewers&#8221; to fall in love with the romance of castles, dresses and even accept women were to be witless creatures-&#8220;seen and not heard.&#8221; Genius, the talent to keep us on the edge of our seats every show with humorous characters, proving  beautiful and handsome are all in the eyes of the beholder, the series manages to fascinatingly use English history as a character.BEWARE VIEWERS! Mr. Fellowes does use his English wit and sarcasm to tittle viewers in every scene, while characters romantically are falling in love and tragically dying.  Viewers will fall in love with all of the cast members- DON&#8221;T!  Unlike other television drama series- Mr. Fellowes has no problem killing a main character off!

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ACU94F93TR1T8	"D. M. Paine ""Renaissance Man"""	Downton Abbey succeeds where other series have failed because it is intelligently written and compellingly acted. Part of its appeal of course lies in recreating a bygone time that many of us Americans are curious about, like our British brethren. It breathes life into an age of pomp and circumstance, that we may not have realized was as alive as it is here. The Crawley family have for ages lived in splendor, and their servants in a lower station in life, but there's a conscious realization that everyone, the rich and the servants, have a  role to play. Indeed, Carson the head butler is proud of his station, and has no hesitation in enforcing the rules with all the staff under his command. This system works because, at least in this household, the Earl's family care about the staff and their well-being, as part of the social compact that makes everything work.This brings a basic humanity to their lives and enables the stories to bring real flesh and personality to the characters. The romantic but ultimately tragic courtship between Mary Crawley and Matthew Crawley (distant cousins) matters to us not just the fluff of soap opera, but we see their torn inner lives and the reconciliation they make to finally accept and love each other. I think Hugh Bonneville is especially effective as Lord Crawley. A benevolent master who rules but knows much is expected of him, he accepts Bates, a semi-invalid veteran who fought with him in the Boer War, as his new valet despite the infighting it causes with other footmen. At a crucial moment in season three, Lord Crawley graciously cedes operating control of his estate to his son-in-laws, fighting the impulse to feel usurped.Like many serials, Downton Abbey contrives events to conform around it's characters. SPOILER ALERT: it seems to me the only reason to kill off Matthew in a car accident is the actor Dan Stevens was ready to leave the show. Still, these things happen with any long-lived show, and the scripts create plenty enough genuine intrigue and action without it.There is so much more you could say to praise Downton Abbey. It's addictiveness to the viewer (like me) is it makes you care about all the members of the household...plus it packs so much into each episode, you can barely miss half an hour before being completely lost in what's happening next.	5.0	The utmost in intelligent continuing series - turns the model on its head	2014-01-28	0	0	0

I can't really add anything new to the already effusive positive reviews of Downton Abbey, so suffice it to say that if you haven't had a chance to see it yet, don't start with this set, start at season 1. You won't be sorry!  They are all on Amazon Prime.So here is a shameless promotion for Amazon Prime: best money I've ever spent. Free shipping, free returns for Prime clothing offers, and the best deal is Amazon Prime Video. We live in the utter boonies ,our choice we love it here, and the nearest grocery store is 16 miles down  a steep hill that is full of big rigs, plus icy 6-7 months a year. The closest Walmart is an hour away.

After viewing the final episode of Season 3, I was inclined to rate this lower, but just couldn't do it.I am trying to be careful not to write a ""spoiler"" but after the birth of Sybl's baby (and that is all I will say) I began to have the sense that I was watching a soap opera. Then events surrounding Tom and Jimmy and now, the ending of the final episode, have continued to give that sense.  The series has been cheapened.The wonderful actors and characters, the costumes, beautiful settings both indoors and out, impeccable attention to period details and manners -- so much has made this series a terrific treat - a feast, really, but the art that this series represents is compromised by heavy handedness with the script.I wasn't expecting a fairy tale where nothing tragic ever happens and all live happily ever after, but this series did not present itself to become an emotional roller coaster.  It goes against the grain of all the other features of the viewing experience.  The events have begun to feel contrived.I am relieved that the season is over, wishing that somehow, the ending was all a mistake -- but glad for a break from it.

A few weeks ago I began watching the series on my iPad, and I love it. I have one more program from season 3 and then will begin season 4.  I can hardly bear to finish it, because then I have to wait for season 5.  It is well done, the people are believable and it doesn't contain foul language, nudity, or sexual scenes.

Downstairs a new footman joins the staff, Obrien & Thomas are no longer allies and romance & jealousy is in the air!

I am such a sucker for the underdog!!  Thomas is great as is the actor,Rob-James Collier, who makes him come alive in this series!  Anna, my second favorite character shows strength and will that will inspire you to become a better person.  Mr. Carson, the man I vote as a living, breathing owl, is here again with wisdom and a respect for the traditional which always keeps me on a respectable path.  I don't think there is one character who doesn't please in this series.  Oh wait!  There is one.  Cora.  I could do without her sideways glances and ridiculous acting by Elizabeth McGovern.  I hate to be harsh but it's true.  She should have died when the flu hit the Downton household.  I totally understand why Lord Grantham only married her for her money.  Otherwise, this is a stellar cast, with stellar scripts!  I shall be watching this series over and over again with pure pleasure.

Its popularity indicates a lot of people share the enthusiasm my wife and I have for the program. No doubt there are those who disagree. If you have not watched it, I recommend you start with the first season and watch multiple episodes before making a decision. If you still don't like it, it's not for you. Meanwhile my wife and I and many many others cannot wait for the next season.	5.0	The Best Soap Opera Ever?	2014-04-02	0	0	0

The story line holds interest and brings such life to all the various goings on in the show among all the characters.  You must watch this series in order and we purchased the Season 1 & 2 Blu-ray DVD and then purchased the Season 3 and also Season 4 Blu-Ray DVD's.

Downton Abbey captures all the style and grace of aristocratic England without the stuffiness one might expect from an English period piece. The characters are all unique and their story lines create a patchwork quilt of subplots that continue to draw in the audience as it moves from one story to another.A soap opera? Perhaps, but the most stylish and engaging that I've ever seen. All class and no trash.	5.0	Class, style and a dynamite character roster	2013-01-25	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1L4EEMS88S4OE	"Ed Yu ""Ed Yu"""	Okay, I admit it--I am an Anglophile!  I'm also a huge fan of almost anything the BBC (and by extension, PBS) does.  To drink of the BBC/PBS is to drink of single malt scotch rather than the others' 'Ripple'--you know, the &#34;flavored&#34; soda pop wine with the screw-off lid. :-)  Specific reasons I give 5-stars to Downton Abbey:  good acting, the human condition portrayed well, excellent storyline, and so on.  I would recommend the drama to anyone who thinks like I do, as partially described above.  I appreciate an excellent series.  I have recently purchased seasons one and two and will soon purchase three and four.  I don't actually have access to television in my house, and having just repatriated myself after teaching for five years in China, without access to PBS or BBC television, am enjoying some of the better productions of same, selectively, through DVDs and VCRs, and the like--avoiding the 99% or so of the &#34;others&#34; (the proverbial &#34;wasteland') as described above.	5.0	Single-malt Scotch vs. 'Ripple'	2014-01-30	0	0	0

They seemed to be trying too hard to think of plot twists and development; the events in the storyline didn't flow as well as they normally did.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3MYZA992OTOEF	"E. Garrett Barlow ""egb23"""	The first two and a half seasons were great, but things unravel in the third season. The plot starts to mirror a soap opera and the producers abandoned their historical narrative in favor of a comfy, modernized 1920s. But more than all of that, if the show can't convince it's biggest stars to stay on to the end of the series, how will they convince the viewers to keep watching as the show kills off main characters whose actors are heading for greener pastures? It looks like they might crawl across the finish line. Too bad, because it started as a great series.	3.0	After a good run, the wheels come off	2013-08-04	4	4	0

I have become very involved in the story of both upstairs and downstairs and the interaction of both sets of characters.

I will let the other reviewers speak to the show itself, but I wanted to make a point about the quality of the Blu-Ray release.  I watched the other seasons of this show on Netflix and had a certain expectation for the video and audio quality when I got this Blu-Ray.  I was blown away when the opening credits of the first episode rolled.  Every scene was incredibly sharp and had a range and depth of color that makes the show I watched on Netflix look like VHS.  The audio was also much improved, though I expected as much since Netflix doesn't have an advanced multi-channel audio setup.	5.0	Much better than watching on Netflix	2013-08-26	0	0	0
1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1TYIZTD8ENM50	"E. Kinderlerer ""Hypnoesther"""	Too much overwritten sloppy sentiment is ruining this once fine drama. The plot lines are becoming repetitive and I yearn for more than romance and vindictive servants trying to get the better of each other. Only Lady Edith's life is at all interesting. The introduction of 18 year old Rose provided some welcome relief. Perhaps they can take her character to some more jazz clubs to give a bit more fun and color.	3.0	Getting somewhat fed up with this now...	2013-02-07	4	3	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1NR526H803RSG	Elaine Rogers	If you're interested in historical drama with some humor thrown in, this is the series for you. The first four seasons span ten years from 1912-1922/23. They deal with the Titanic disaster; WWI; women's rights; the plight of farmers; the realization of the aristocracy that they need to make changes in the running of their estates in order to keep up and maintain what they've had for generations; as well as dealing with rape, the lives of servants, love between classes, relationships of the &#34;upstairs&#34; family(there are even several mentions of how showing emotion is very un-British;-), and so much more. I had four days to myself while my family was away and I decided to give Downton Abbey a chance and I ended up watching all 30 episodes in those four days. What else can I say? The acting is superb!

I cried , I laughed, I grinned like an idiot, and wept openly when Sybil and Matthew died. I truly went through every emotion  possible in that 2 weeks.  Now January 5th, 2014 seems an eternity away.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AUNRM6W80QRXB	"Elizabeth Klatt ""Libby A &#34;Firm Believer&#34;"""	I was disappointed with the disjointed stories in Season 3 of Downton Abbey. I loved the first and second series, especially the second. I practically wore holes in my BluRays while my husband was deployed last year. By the by, he's deployed again this year and I can't stand to actually watch these episodes more than once or twice more to fill in the background while I'm doing housework. The characters aren't as engaging or likeable; we don't get to spend as much time with any of them; I can't stand Shirley MacLain. Bringing in a big name (and tragedy for the sake of tragedy for that matter) for the draw, in this case, disappoints miserably. Hoping that Season 4 is better written, more cohesive, and more intimate.	3.0	Not as good as Season 1 and 2	2013-09-20	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2DSVMIN44ESPZ	Elliott Dickerson	The acting, the set, and the drama is all top notch in this PBS masterpiece theatre production. The time period is one not often talked about nor seen on modern tv lineups. Great actors bring this show to the next level on subjects that would normally be rather boring or forgettable. The third season has many unforeseen twists and disappointments both for the characters and the viewer. Unexpected deaths and finance issues seem to be the focus of many of the episodes. Love the character development and the sympathetic emotions it pulls out of the you as you watch characters you may hate or love struggle with tough choices and situations.

The Elizabeth Gaskell series that predates this time period is something other viewers might like to see, as they make history come alive and they provide a sense of continuity that a person might not otherwise consider.	4.0	Good Series...BBC Soap Opera	2013-03-06	3	2	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A384ONGAM1SL7P	endlessstream	There are plenty of reviews out there explaining the virtues of this show: period sets and costumes, interesting look at a historic social structure, digging into social issues which were important at the time and continue to have strong relevance today.  The story line is a bit slow, though, and sometimes not that interesting.  Laid up with an injury, I &#34;binge-watched&#34; the first three seasons over 2.5 weeks.  The first one was engrossing, though the acting of the Cora character was an annoyance.  I am pretty sure that is how she is being directed to act, though, because the character itself is just as shallow and frustrating as the acting.  The second season continued to be engaging, though the speed of time passing was so quick (nearly a year per episode in some spots), that a lot of plot-drivers are left to the imagination.  The third season is pretty boring.  Same story lines, rehashed.  Maybe it is because the &#34;world&#34; of the show has been so thoroughly well-explained in past episodes, that there is little left to fascinate.  Maybe it is because we have found out so many hidden secrets of the characters that there is little left to surprise. Maybe it is because their world is becoming more like our modern-day one - interesting from a historical perspective but not from a televised fiction. Constant footage of two of the main characters making out.  The romance was interesting while there was some sexual tension in it, but watching married people be in love isn't interesting in itself.  Only still watching because I'm on bed rest.  By the time the 4th season is available for instant viewing, I probably won't get around to seeing it.	3.0	Mostly very good, a few flaws	2014-04-15	0	0	0

We've been watching since the first season and there hasn't been a bad episode yet.

I broke down and agreed to watch Downton Abbey and I am glad I did.  Not only are my wife and I together, but it is an enjoyable show.  From a man's perspective it is a little slow at times, but the characters are believable and perform well.  We were 3 seasons behind and just caught up in time for the season 4 premiere.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3K04IZWCX70QS	Erika Hill	Lavish and beautiful to look at, Downtown Abbey's third season returns with the same level of drama viewers have come to expect of the Crawleys and their servants.  One of Downtown's most winning traits is how well they develop their characters and season three continues this tradition, with special focus on the characters of Tom Branson, Lady Sybil's chauffeur-turned-husband, and problems faced by Thomas, the ever wily footman.  There are fun new faces, such as Shirley McClaine, and the return of a few old ones as well.There are a few stumbling blocks; romantic rivalries between house servants feels very soapy, as does the plot line surrounding the financial future of Downtown.  But overall it's the same winning period piece fans have come to love, with some lovely moments and some heartbreaking twists before all is said and done.	5.0	Beautiful as always	2013-08-20	0	0	0

But the Thomas, Ethel and Branson story arcs are absolutely ludicrous. The Thomas plot arc in season 3 (end of) was just pure BBC propaganda. At the very least, Thomas should have been sent packing, instead he's made under butler?? what??? Thomas should have been just like Ethel was (sent packing), but the BBC falls face first on the gay sword-no surprise there. The Ethel story line was much more honest and real, then got absurd, then real again.  The Branson story line, had the BBC stayed true to Edwardian History, would have been sent packing too and daughter disowned. What's next? BBC's next version of Pride and Prejudice will have Charlotte Lucas (Or Mr. Collins) come out of the closet, Lydia smashing the entail and inheriting all of Longborne. .... and Mary Bennett will have her first born child at Longborne courtesy of AI.... boring...	2.0	BBC PC Rules the Day... boring....	2014-01-06	2	2	0

When I watch Downton Abbey, I am transported to the 20s in England and I can actually forget I am on my couch watching it through the internet.I long for ragtime, those flapper dresses, the jalopies and a society with so many rules to keep every person reined in.  The lower classes toiling until they go to bed, the rich who do nothing but change their clothes and travel...

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A235IF7V4XS5HB	Eugene	*Spoilers*The first half of Season 3 is worth watching for several poignant moments. I was especially moved by  Mrs. Hughes' storyline since I consider her the most compassionate character at Downton. When she stands framed in the shadows of the corridor and accepts that she may die, it is one of the finest shots of the series. I also loved Carson's surreptitious singing revealing just how much he loves her. Also enjoyable, though brief and thinly portrayed, is Shirley MacLaine's appearance as she brings fresh air to the stodginess of English tradition.Unfortunately, my interest waned after Sybil's moving and unexpected death in Episode Five. As the episodes progressed, Mary, Father Crawley, and Matthew grew increasingly irritating to me. The subplots reintroducing the fallen maid and the battle between Mrs. O'Brien and Thomas were tiresome and repetitive. Bates in prison and out of prison was boring. With the introduction of the silly 18-year old ingenue, the season jumped the shark. Maybe Ted McGinley was unavailable.Lastly, the season ending was dreadful. Due to his expired contract with the show, Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) had to die an untimely soap-opera death and, as his car plummeted, so did the series.	2.0	Starts well, ends with a whimper	2013-09-10	4	4	0

Having previously watched the UK version (while overseas) and currently watching the US as broadcast by PBS I can say that the UK edition is MISSING a few short but quite good sequences.I don't quite understand why this is but must say that it is unfortunate as some of these sequences add better continuity to the story.If you can wait for the US version, I would recommend that you wait for that version to become available.	3.0	Excellent series - but content is shorter than what is being shown in US	2013-02-07	2	2	0

This movie has one death that is hard to take, and if Anna and Bates happiness is suppose to compensate for that death, all I can say is the writers are not reading their customers (viewers) correctly. As for this seasons ending, this better be one of those cliff hangers where he is JUST seriously injured and lives after all. I will not be pre-ordering season 4, thats for sure.	1.0	If you love a happy ending, season 3 is NOT for you !	2013-01-30	14	10	4

If you do not have any idea how they lived in the late 1800 and early 1900 in England you will find it here. Plus it is a good clean program to watch and you can see things were just like they are to day but just accure in a different style.Such as people jockeying to try and cause some one to fail at their job so they can get it. Great story that displays the way the upper crust rich tried to live,and the importance of keeping that  apperance to the public..Flay	5.0	What I got from Downton Abbey	2013-08-21	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A342CAVHO0T0PC	"Flying Lady 76 ""N2theBlue"""	This is the most additive show I have watched in a very long time.  You get caught up in the rhythm of the individual lives of each character and you can&#8217;t look away.  I love how human each one is.  The evil is not absolute nor is the good.  Sometimes these characters do the most surprising things and that is what makes it so worth watching.In any case, I haven&#8217;t started watching Season 4 yet because I like to stream them back to back.  What has surprised me most of all is that both friends and acquaintances of mine from every end of the political and religious realms seem to be hooked on this unique show.Note to anyone reading my review; it is so worth your time.  It isn&#8217;t a typical show as seen here in the US; it is slow, rich and lovely.  It is a bit like reading a wonderful novel.  Bravo Mr. Fellowes.  Good job!	5.0	Love it!	2014-01-23	0	0	0

No traffic, crowds, parking, or bags to deal with and I get to comparison shop online in my home with the fireplace on, wearing pajamas, and a cup of coffee!I have been wanting to watch Downton Abbey and didn't know where to go to see it...and it shows up on Amazon Prime for free!  My daughter and I watched both seasons through my son's XBox between Christmas and New Year's while it rained outside.  Totally wonderful and I had no idea this was available to us!  This HD version was great and I would tell anyone to watch this amazing series.  It is set in an era we don't see portrayed often: early 1900's when electricity, telephones, and &#34;motor carriages&#34; were just coming on the scene in homes...along with women's suffrage.  Can't wait for January 6th when it premieres on PBS...although, we will have to wait to watch each episode every week.  Watching the series on Amazon Prime, we were able to watch one right after the other, so we got totally spoiled!	5.0	Amazon Prime:  Free Two Day Shipping and Downton Abbey...What?!!!!

I would have chosen to re-cast instead of killing them off. I'm sure many wouldn't agree, but I'm sure just as many would! Soaps do it all the time!

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2W6LSYUTM0H66	Fred	... but Amazon is sorely lacking with their closed caption programing.This is only CC on your computer (when I watched it in Jan 2013), not if you are watching it using a PS3 or &#34;non-Amazon&#34; device. The other missing star is because the streaming was always buffering and then I lost picture quality. It went from a quality HD picture to something quite out of focus. This was using an HDMI cable from my computer to my TV (so I could watch it on the big screen with CC).As soon as Amazon catches up with their nearest competition (associated with the color red) in the streaming department... I will give five star programs such as Downton Abbey five stars. Great series, mediocre digital delivery.	3.0	Could have been five stars...	2013-02-02	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AG8K92N37MT27	Garnet	This has to be one of my favorite costume drama pieces ever to come out of England...and I guess I'm definitely not alone in that opinion.  I have watched them avidly on PBS and then went out and bought each DVD as they've come out and re-watched them again.  The intersecting stories of the nobility upstairs and the servants downstairs continues to intrique and enthrall.  I love to love some characters and I love to hate some characters, and some of them even switch in my affections over time.Season Three takes place in the early 1920's.  Now that WWI is behind Downton, the estate still isn't safe as they take a hit in their finances and have to come to terms with the idea of modernization.  Mary and Matthew are finally together (yeah!) and their wedding is beautifully done, but Matthew is clearly hopeful of a child (and heir) to be.  Edith loses out on her wedding dreams, but discovers her own voice.  I must say, I have gone from disliking her to liking her in this season.  The same with Ms O'Brien, as she becomes a deeper character who is sorry for her mistakes, but still has that sharp tongue.  While, Thomas...well, what can one say about Thomas.  He will emerge a bit of a dark hero by the end of this season.Not sure what I think about the new character of Rose, a young would-be flapper, but it looks like she will be joining the regular cast, and so far I'm liking her.  Also adored the brief bit with Shirley McLaine as Cora's mother and her sarcastic interaction with the Dowager (Maggie Smith)...what can be better with two fabulous actors like this!  Loved every moment of their conversational banter.The world is changing and Downton is changing with it, despite all the attempts of our favorite grumpy by the book yes M'Lord butler.  None of the characters stay static in this show and no one is safe from an untimely end, which makes the stories not only interesting but really sends you on an emotional rollercoaster.  Just when things look their best and brightest--watch out!Non-character stars of the show include the beautiful 1920's style clothing (bring back feathered and jeweled headbands!), the vintage cars, and Oh My! that wonderful trip to the Scottish Highlands that rounds out the season.  Perfect.  Just perfect.If you love Downtown, you will love this season...even if it will break your heart at times.  Can't wait until Season 4!	5.0	Still Going Strong	2013-08-01	1	1	0

The acting and the look of the show has not changed. Still great, and some great additional characters to add a little intrigue. What I hated, I really hated. However, it was the writers fault, not the actors. Rumors circulated that someone was going to die in season 3. I'll just say for the ones who haven't seen the show, I hate it when I am right. When the show was happy it was happy, and when the show was sad it was DEVASTATINGLY sad. A very emotionally draining season, that I am glad to an extent that I saw. I will not purchase it though until I see DA season 4. Lets just say that I think they have a lot to prove to me.	5.0	This was hard to rate, so read my review.	2013-08-14	0	0	0

The third season seemed like Fellows was trying too hard to trump the previous season rather than let the viewers delight in the interactions between the families and society.  The three weakest plot points tended to dominate the season and not for the series' betterment.  I still enjoyed seeing the characters I came to admire on the screen and now after the conclusion of Season 3, I know I will come back for more - even if just to see Mr. Carson help make sense of it all.	4.0	Not my favorite season	2013-10-21	0	0	0

Running time was 49 minutes as opposed to PBS' 51 minutes.The scene missing was where Mrs Hughes in the kitchen mentions that there's a woman in the village who had a baby and can feed Sybil's baby.On the DVD  the only mention of the village woman is when Cora tells everyone in the drawing room upstairs.  I have noticed all PBS so far have run 51 minutes.  And the 2 version I watched on the DVD (UK version as sold by PBS)  runs 49.  I cant believe this. Why would they cut out 2- 2/12 minutes per eippisode on the DVD?Just wanted everyone to know.  But the quality is wonderful and none of that awful jumping which was evident in Season 2 dvd set which many people had a problem with including mine.	4.0	Warning--DVd's are shorter than what shows on PBS.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1GRBMSW3YOHFS	Gina Lyons	Lots of interesting storylines this season. Some new additions, which are good. A few shocks, but I knew about them long before watching this season, so I was prepared. The antagonistic interaction between Violet and Isobel is always entertaining. Good to see Tom becoming a bigger part of the family. Many tricky issues resolved ethically during this season. It was gratifying to see Thomas' homosexuality eventually be accepted by everyone and especially Lord Grantham -- not sure what sentiments there were during the early 20s, but it was against the law. A common theme expressed by many of the characters was that he did not choose to be that way and there seemed to be genuine compasion for him.Overall, a great season with some shocking and sad events mixed with some very happy ones.	5.0	Loved It	2014-01-08	0	0	0

Then as I got more into it, I realized this is how the &#34;class system works&#34; and everyone knew their place.When the war began, and some of them got involved, I wanted to see how accurate their timelines were. I must say they were quite accurate. Seeing Mrs. Crawley start the hospital, at the Mansion, was great to see how the women were allowed to help in the war effort.I must say....I was dumfounded by the way season 3 ended. I believe I am still reeling from it.	5.0	Downton Abbey	2013-12-29	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ADXAE3UOGPUN4	Goldilocks	This season carries with it the untimely demise of two favorite characters-Lady Sybil and Matthew Crowley.And the jilting at the altar of Lady Sybil. But the best part was the much anticipated wedding of Mary and Matthew. Other highlights were the cricket match and the family's holiday trip to Scotland. There are many twists and turns in this season which makes it an attractive season (I liked the time when Cora's mother is visiting from the USA, and she is quite a contrast to her  English counterpart. ). Again , another splendid season which one could watch again and again.The three DVDs arrived on time and are of good quality. Surely, a great possession which I will cherish for a long time. In Downton Abbey the dialogues (especially of Maggie Smith)are worthh remembering and quoting!	5.0	Tragic and exhilrating at the same time	2014-01-23	0	0	0
1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1ZJSK7OG0HA7O	Golfguy101	We like the show a lot. But it's wearing on us a bit that every time they seem to struggle to think of what's next -- they kill-off a main character. Doing that 1 or 2 times for effect is 1 thing. Having it as a general plot dynamic that repeats indefinitely -- annoying. It's starting to be like they are trying to continuously get us attached and then pull our heart strings.	4.0	Solid show (review contains spoilers)	2013-12-19	0	0	0

Not only is downtown abbey visually pleasant, for those who like occasional twists and turns within multiple plot lines you will be very satisfied! Richly beautiful,the entire show pulls you into the story, giving both your heart and mind the shocks,joys and plotting on both up and downstairs. You will follow your favourite characters until something happens WTO either warm your il, and soul or jar it with surprises. The location is absolutely lush, the costumes are exquisite and historically correct. You will thoroughly enjoy it! I suggest you begin at season one ,so as to not become hopelessly lost. Enjoy reliving history within the setting of a true manor home from around1915 into the 1920's, and see both good, and bad choices,the changes in Enlish class culture. I really love this show, even with jolts and shocking cast losses, I go from pure relaxation to utter surprise due to excellent storyline writing and great acting!

Loved that they family realizes they employ many people and are responsible for providing jobs, that's something anyway. I tried to imagine what role I would play if I lived during that time...probably one of the milk maids with revolutionary views.

I like to imagine how past customs, events, and technologies led to some of what I experience today; also fun to imagine that parts of human life are perennial as the grass regardless of all the rest of it--falling in love, having babies, relating across social classes and generations.  Downton Abbey delivers in those ways, yet falls into a bit of the 'soapy' realm in the screenplay.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A13TO5TU4A68LD	Gryphonisle	"There was a time,  back in the 1990's, when a BBC miniseries put as much emphasis on historical accuracy as it did on entertainment value, perhaps more.  I remember one such program set in the 1920's that was so slow moving and dull that drying paint would have been more interesting.  Those days are over, and Downton Abbey is not your father's BBC miniseries.  Historical accuracy is left for, well, to quote many speakers at the recent GOP convention,  the fact checkers to decide.  No, one does not see jet contrails over the manor house, or hear Led Zeppelin coming from a maid's room, but characters do utter words and phrases not yet coined.  In one episode, our dear Livinia is (in jest) said to be ""sucking up to"" her mother in law, which would have been a rather disturbing idea, between two adult women in 1919.In such a world, WWI showed up to add drama to the end of the last episode of the first season, and was gone, having taken out only a couple of superfluous characters, by the time we were 2/3 of the way through Season 2, all wounds healed, except on characters marked for dire ends in Season 3.  The Spanish Flu Pandemic (1919) arrived for one episode in Season 2, in order to take out another superfluous character, but just to make sure we understood her intentions, the episode introduced a Ouija board, so she could speak to us from the beyond.  Yep, this is the New BBC miniseries.  No child left behind.So, it was with no little excitement that Downton Abbey Season 3 crossed the atlantic early this year, and with Shirley MacLaine among the cast.Calm down, she only got three episodes, as the writers apparently didn't allow her a fortune big enough to save Downton Abbey, so there wasn't any need to keep her around once that was revealed.  This is not a spoiler.  Besides, it was a strangely subdued, almost sedated MacLaine.  I imagine she had to have shots due to wounds she suffered in the battle with her wardrobe.  For nearly all of her appearances, MacLaine, rather wildly dressed in 1920's gowns for mature women, seems to be getting swallowed whole by her costume, and can barely keep her head out of its throat, and as a result, is restricted to rather gnomic one liners intended to make her (a New York/Newport socialite) the paragon of Democracy, speaking Truth to the wily Old World landed gentry.As if...Anyone who's read Edith Wharton, or seen the movies (""House of Mirth"") knows that American high society was as constricted, if not moreso, as any of the nobles of Europe, and just as class conscious.  MacLaine's character would have been fawning over the Granthams not pushing back.  AND she's Jewish?  You mean the titled families of England were marrying into foreign Jewish fortunes, in an era when anti-Semitism was barely disguised in the US, and some big wigs over there would later openly sympathize with Hitler?Again, cool down big feller, that's for them fact checkers...Yes, this is the topsy turvy world aimed at lightly educated Moderns, whose concepts of history are hazy at best, and who are so complacent in their world view, of the eternal character of the status quo, the Republic, that science is often thought of as merely ""another opinion"".  The New BBC Miniseries is a lot like its PBS cousins, education is but a minor component of its goal.Downton Abbey is pure entertainment in period clothes.  Too much thinking will only cause headaches and make enemies of those around you, who only want to be entertained.  It probably could be better, and who knows, more provocative, but would anybody watch it, these days?  It's sad to have to ask, but would they?"	4.0	The New! Improved! Tastier! (No Calories!)

Each character brings so much to the storyline and potential for more. Sorry a very good character was eliminated of the final show for season 3.  Yes, there is know a male heir, but there could have been so much more without going overboard in romance.  Looking forward to the next season, which I know have started, but have not watched.	5.0	Quality Show - Nice Change From Never Ending Investigation, Murder, and Psychopaths	2014-01-20	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A20FK68BUB1IVA	Happy Reader	"If you haven't seen all of Season 3 and the 2012 Christmas special, called ""A Journey to the Highlands"", you probably don't want spoilers. I am going to give a synopsis of the Special Features, and that's difficult without giving some facts away as to season 3. Two important characters die in two different places on this 3-disc set (I won't say who, but the actor playing the one that dies during the Christmas Special wanted to leave the show). The deaths might make you want to take Julian Fellowes, writer and creator, to task. But then again, having tragedy amidst the joy is what makes ""Downton Abbey"" a really really great show. I have a couple people hooked on ""Downton Abbey"" who have never watched ""Masterpiece Theater"" before!This Season 3 DVD set contains three discs. It DOES have the 2012 Christmas Special. I have received my DVD set, ordered on this page, and it has parts 1 - 9 of Season 3, plus ""A Journey to the Highlands"" and 8 Special Features.DISC 1:Disc 1 has parts 1, 2, and 3 of Season 3 and 1 extra. English subtitles are available.Special Features:1. ""Behind the Drama"" (60 minutes) This is an fabulous overview of the first two seasons, with clips from the two seasons, interviews and rehearsal scenes. What I particularly liked is that it's not just a rehash of the plot lines, it includes why a plot line or character development was important or undertaken. Per the narrator, before WWI, there were 1.4 million people ""in service"" in England. Highclere Castle, ""with more than 50 bedrooms, there was plenty to do."" And plenty of rules, and the hierarchy below stairs was even stricter than above stairs.When a scene takes place upstairs, they are really filmed at Highclere Castle. When below stairs, though, they were filmed on sets at Ealing Studios. That's because though the magnificent upstairs is much the same (except for bathrooms!) now as it was before WWI, the kitchens and downstairs have been modernized.Remember the scene where ""The Turk"" enters Lady Mary's bedroom and she says, ""You and my parents have something in common. You think I am much more of a rebel than I am."" (Which is pretty humorous in itself, given that Mary is most tradition-hide-bound of the sisters.) Julian Fellowes tells us that the whole dead Turkish lover is based on a true story. A friend of his, who owns a Big House, ""came upon a diary of one of his great-aunts, and this whole incident is recorded"".The commentators also touch on the Spanish Flu epidemic, which may have killed up to 50,000,000 people world wide. Most flus are most lethal to the very young and the elderly. I've read that the Spanish Flu, however, was most lethal to healthy adults. It made your immune system go wild, attacking your body as well as the virus. So the healthier your immune system was, the more likely it was going to kill you.DISC 2:Disc 2 has parts 4. 5. 6. and 7 of Season 3. English subtitles are available. There are no special features on this disc.DISC 3:Disc 3 has parts 8 & 9 of Season 3, as well as ""A Journey to the Highlands"" (the 2012 Christmas special) and 7 Special Features. English subtitles are available.Special Features:1. ""Downton in 1920"" (20 minutes) Commentators include Julian Fellowes (writer and creator), Brian Percival (director, episodes 1 & 2), Magi Vaughan (make up & hair designer), Caroline McCall (costume designer), Charmain Adams (production designer), Elizabeth McGovern (plays Cora, Countess of Grantham), Michelle Dockery (plays Lady Mary), Laura Carmichael (plays Lady Edith), Alastair Bruce (historical advisor), Jim Carter (plays Mr. Carson the butler), Lesley Nichol (plays Mrs. Patmore, the cook), Jessica Brown Finlay (plays Lady Sybil), Sophie McShera (plays Daisy Mason, cook assistant), Allen Leech (plays Tom Branson, the chauffeur), Brendan Coyle (plays John Bates), Gareth Neame (executive producer), Shirley MacLaine (plays Martha Levinson, Cora's American mother), Dan Stevens (plays Matthew Crawley), and Pete Gaine (from Motorhouse Hire Ltd, who supplied Matthew's marvelous 1920 car).In Season 3, it's 1920. When we think 1920, we think ""The Roaring Twenties"". But, as Caroline McCall points out, ""I think people's perception of the 20's is very different from 1920.""  Julian Fellowes points out that the Charleston dance craze didn't happen until 1926. The hair and costume designers had to show fashions changing gradually, because it's not as if everyone started dressing like flappers in 1920.The rigid laced-up corsets of before the war, give way to bandeau corsets and breast-flattening bras. Even the men show subtle changes in their suit jackets, etc. Except for Mr. Carson, of course, who continues to wear exactly the same suit he always has.It wasn't just clothing that was changing. As Alastair Bruce says, ""We see this great imperial family gradually alter, as moral conscience takes us on a different path."" Very much the way the Imperial British Empire was altering.2. ""The Wedding of Lady Mary"" (18 minutes) Commentators include many from extra #1, with new ones: Victoria Brooks (head of publicity for ""Downton Abbey""), Liz Turbridge (producer), Matthew 'Sparky' Ellis (location manager), Charmain Adams (production designer), Maggie Harris (resident of Bampton, where the wedding was filmed), Rev. David Lloyd (Vicar of Bampton), Timothy Word (crowd assistant director), Danielle Bennett (second assistant director), Rupert Steggle (crowd costume assistant), Hugh Bonneville (plays Robert, Lord Grantham), Rob James-Collier (plays Thomas Barrow, footman and troublemaker), Chris Croucher (first assistant director), Stephen Sorby (from Above the Line Security) and Joanne Froggatt (plays Anna Bates).Victoria Brooks says, ""It's almost the next royal wedding, dare we say it!"" There were 209 total crew & cast, including the extras, and the paparazzi was wild to get a photo of ""Mary"" in her wedding dress.3. ""The Wedding of Lady Edith"" (25 minutes) Commentators include many who also appear in the first 2 extras, as well as Robert Bathurst (plays Sir Anthony Strallan), Denis Maguire (supporting artist, plays the photographer at the church), David Holt (special effects technician) and Damian Butlin (standby propman).Poor Edith - how many of us think that? Julian Fellowes says, ""Her self-rebuilding will become another part of the story.... The subliminal message, I think, is we must get behind the wheels of our own lives.""We should take a poll. Did Sir Anthony act out of misguided honor or is he just a jerk? And if we don't think he's a jerk, how about Lord Robert's part in this?4. ""The Men of Downton Abbey"" (12 minutes) Commentators appear in the first 3 specials. This focuses on how WWI was the changemaker, whether you were above stairs or below stairs. Hugh Bonneville says, ""After the turmoil of the war, Robert thinks, in a way, that life will return to the way it was before the way. And, of course, it never will.""Alastair Bruce adds, ""People have survived something [in WWI], and they are never going to forget what they've gone through.... It changes their view of what they expect from the world.""5. ""Shirley MacLaine at Downton"" (16 minutes) MacLaine hadn't been watching ""Downton Abbey"" herself, but she had friends who were addicts. It's a sign of how good the show is that it could get a Shirley MacLaine to be in it. Sophie McShera groans, ""I didn't get to meet Shirley MacLaine and I'm so jealous.""Rob James-Collier is excited just talking about the meeting of Shirley Maclaine and Dame Maggie Smith on the show. ""They are going to be epic, they really are. Two actual legends on screen, battling it out. The only thing I can liken it to is DeNiro vs Pacino in ""Heat""!"" (""Heat"" is an American 1995 movie.)6. ""Behind the Scenes: The Cricket Match"" (10 minutes) Many commentators appear before. New ones are Eddie Williams (3rd assistant director), Adam Ghillam (camera operator), Kevin Doyle (plays Molesley, the butler for Mrs. Crawley, Matthew's mother), Ed Speleers (plays Jimmy Kent, new footman), Cora Theobold (plays Ivy Stuart, new kitchen maid), David Evans (director episodes 7 & 8) and Matt Milne (plays Alfred Nugent, footman).The match took three days to shoot. Mr. Carson takes part, and Jim Carter says, ""It's lovely for Carson to be out in his cricket gear. First time in three years I've had a change of clothes."" Only one cast member taking part in the match actually knew how to play cricket. Thanks to stand-ins and clever camera work, you wouldn't know it.7. ""Behind the Scenes: A Journey to the Highlands"" Many familiar commentators, with these new ones: Lily James (plays Lady Rose MacClare), Andy Goddard (director for this episode) and Diana Scrivener (choreographer). For this 2012 Christmas special, cast and crew traveled, for filming, to Inveraray Castle, Scotland, seat of the real Duke of Argyll. Incredibly beautiful scenery, but everybody complains about the outdoor scenes where they were attacked by hordes of midges.For the show, Inveraray stands in for Duneagle Castle, home of Sir Robert's cousin, Hugh 'Shrimpy' MacClare. His 18 year-old daughter, Rose, will, according to Julian Fellowes become a prominent character going forward. The staff that stays home at Downton Abbey aren't forgotten, and the episode shifts back and forth between Scotland and Downton. New romance is in the air for more than one character. Lesley Nichol says she asked Fellowes to give Mrs. Patmore a love interest, and he complied. Lesley says, ""Mr. Tufton has taken over our local shop. He's a bit of a flirty ponce, which shocks her [Mrs. Patmore] sideways, really, because I don't think people flirt with Mrs. Patmore.""Season 4 of ""Downton Abbey"" starts filming in late February 2013. I can't wait to see it!"	5.0	DOES have 2012 Christmas Special, NINE Episodes, Here's a Synopsis of DVD Special Features!	2013-02-01	7	5	2

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2KSKD55454C9G	Harold E. Dungan	The characters and story are believable.  Perhaps the best of all is that the characters are real and l can identify with each one (sometimes painfully) in one way or another.  When we have watched one episode we can hardly wait for the next one because the actors/actresses draw us into their lives.  I especially appreciate the underlying moral tone of the series which stands out in contrast to other 'stuff' on TV.  There is some violence and sex, but they fit the story and lives of the characters without being overdone.  We also like the smooth flow of the episodes and of the series as a whole, because it is historically based and takes us along on its journey with the characters and situations.  This is a great series, and perhaps the best we have ever watched.  Keep up the good work and keep Downton Abbey coming.	5.0	The Best Show on TV	2013-09-01	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A9MPYZQT03OE0	"Harold Wiberg ""brit TV fan"""	has come and gone.  We have been Brit TV fans for 30 years and counting.  We've primarily followed the various mystery series but have also enjoyed other offerings.  Downton Abbey has taken their TV productions to new heights in a way that Julian Fellows probably never thought possible, but at the same time a sense of detachment and disappointment has settled in after this season.  l hate to be spiteful but it's slowly evolving into an extremely well produced soap opera.  With the various characters coming and going you get the sense they're trying to keep the storyline alive but too many improbable events add up to hard-to-believe episodes.  This entire series has been the best of the best and I consider it to be the crowning achievement of Brit TV. Some of us, a lot of us, here in America have a serious appetite for this formal English society with all its maneuvering and back biting - regardless of our social emphasis on the everyman here.  It's a look back at a different culture, done in an amazingly detailed manner, in an incredibly gorgeous setting, with acting as only the British can bring to the screen.	4.0	Yet another season...	2013-03-01	1	1	0
1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AO1Z0TQWCRGL4	"Harold Wolf ""Doc"""	"Worth every cent in price, every minute in time. A powerful period costume drama (some call a Soap) with historical excellence upstaged by perfection in acting. It's the ""Roots"" of historical family drama for the 21st century. You'll drool your champagne over locations, costumes, props, and sets.AND IT'S TO CONTINUE FOR A 4th SEASON. The biggest question is not will it maintain the UK and US growing following, but will it contain Matthew Crowley (Dan Stevens). But he's at least back doing his best and wedding Mary (Michelle Dockery) and will take over the realm of Downton Abbey, even though Earl Robert (Hugh Bonneville) has bungled the finances, always a plot among the early English wealthy families.Yes, much of the former cast is back, joined with the American upstart actress Shirley MacLaine playing Cora's (Elizabeth McGovern) American mother. With this huge star going against the impeccable delivery of lines from Dowager Violet (Maggie Smith), the excitement and cast excellence remains. Combined, these 2 drive a thread of sharp-spark delight through this third series. She's welcomed by cast and viewers. Past issues, like imprisonment, the Bates, Anna & John, also continues in romance/tragedy form.Although the UK gets first peeks, it is America that is driving worldwide success. It will continue in some form, and at the peak of seductive drama.To Downton Abbey fans, it is just ""family"" being viewed.The 1920 English lifestyle of the aristocrat and their home staff has never been presented better since Upstairs, Downstairs. Only time will tell if Downton Abbey fans will drive this series beyond the regal success of U,D. I suspect they will. It's powerful writing coming from the pen of Julian Fellowes, and perhaps will end only at his decision. The writing behind the Abbey is as deliciously alluring toward characters as Catherine Cookson's work. Already the public demands more, I and my wife included. She nearly wore out season 2 DVDs and will do likewise to Season 3. We'll order Season 4 as soon as the listing appears.SUBTITLED.Not a rental. It's a MUST OWN.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A37W9QTR9PNALC	Harry F. Keathley	Downton Abbey is why the Brits excell in story telling.  Somewhere deep within, they cling to the whole Haves & have-not issue which has existed in Britain for hundreds of years.  The idea that servants somehow deserve more, but probably wouldn't take it if they could, fuses the whole &#34; pressure makes diamonds&#34; cliche.  Upstairs Downstairs, but with a shorter set of stairs; that's Downton Abbey.  As for Americas fascination with this amazingly well produced soap opera harkens back to Washingtons troops laying eyes for the first time on actual Red Coats, prior to moving forward into Revolutionary War battles.  &#34; Are these guys actually gonna fight in that regalia?&#34;  We love the unique intrigue, tho a similar drama based on pre-Civil War intrigues featuring wealthy white slave owners would never work here!	4.0	Downton Abbey Places The Little Guy Above The Frey In Downton Abbey	2014-03-05	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A18FFOY1FWG5NT	Hayat	"Series 3 was a huge disappointment to me for several reasons.  The stories did not flow as nicely as Series 1 and 2.  For instance, the storyline about Matthew's indecision about taking Reggie Swire's fortune was a total waste of time.  It added nothing to the series and it only served to show Mary's ugly side.  I also didn't understand why some of the characters' personalities changed.  For instance, Lord Grantham suddenly became an incompetent loser who couldn't seem to hold things together. Then we have two new footmen and Cousin Rose who were awful additions.  All of the stories involving the two footmen and Rose seemed to be written in a hurry and thrown in willy nilly and again did not add anything to the continuing saga of Downton Abbey.  And for all the hype about Shirley Maclaine being added to the cast and her interaction with Maggie Smith's character, that was a total bust.  Shirley Maclaine's acting was awful and her role was so small that she could have phoned it in.  The so-called ""brilliant"" exchanges with Maggie Smith never materialized.  And what happened to Cora?  They should have killed off her character when she had the Spanish flu because all she does is walk through the scenes with that silly smile and her head lowered.  The only time she showed any emotion was when Lady Sybil died.  Other than that she does nothing useful and surprisingly shows very little interest in Sybil's baby.  Not once did she hold the baby.  Branson is another character who underwent a huge personality change.  He became a robot.  He needs to ride off into the sunset with his daughter.  The deaths of two main characters did not bother me so much as the poor script.  It appears to me that Fellowes has gotten bored with Downton or maybe his mind has been too much on the American program he is making.  As I understand it, other writers will be making the future scripts and that's usually not a good thing.  I enjoyed the first two series of Downton Abbey immensely, but Series 3 has turned me off so much that I don't think I will be watching it in the future."	1.0	Downton Abbey 3 is a disappointment	2013-02-20	13	9	4

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2SLVE5QBHWCWW	Henry's Mom	I must be the only person I know to turn Downton Abbey off in the middle of a show.  I liked season 1 and most of season 2, even though the plots seemed to get progressively more dramatic and unbelievable. But I must say season 3 made season 2 look positively restrained!  If you like period soap operas, this would be a wonderful show for you - a varied story line, shot in a castle and other beautiful sets, with great accents, costumes, and scenery.  I'm just not into soap operas.  I turned it off in the middle of one of the first few shows of season 3 and haven't been back.	2.0	A differing opinion	2014-01-29	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AU1E4E8XVVXL1	HeyItsDoug	Not much to really add here. Downton Abbey is arguably one of the best period series to hit the airwaves; here in the U.S. and across the pond. Season 3 doesn't disappoint and brings us even closer to all of the principal characters and introduces us to some new ones. From the stunning Cybil to the ever conforming Mr. Carson to the do-gooder Matthew. Their all here at their best! And while the season(series?) finale episode will leave you trying to make sense of it all, I strongly suggest you watch this awesome story from the very first episode in season 1. Entertainment at it's best and the picture quality through Amazon Prime streaming is excellent. Spend some quality time with the Crawleys.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2YZZBW32K06K1	H. Kany	There are some fine moments -- Thomas and James sorting it out near the end for instance; the beauty of the Scottish landscape, etc. but the writer finds no way to develop the relationship between Matthew and Mary other than to have them off each other or sentimentally enrapt with little in the way of nuances.  This lack of development reflects a lack of imagination or interest in complex human interaction.  Since the first two seasons were primarily driven by the chemistry between these two characters and the possibilities of bringing them together, this two dimensional and clumsy handling of their marriage has the effect of letting all the air out of the balloon.  Instead, we get a shifting of focus from one relationship or situation to another to keep us interested.  It works for a time but sooner or later the audience wants to be fed and most of what transpires is not satisfying.  Killing off characters is dramatic as death has a way of stealing a scene or two, but good drama it is not.	1.0	crabby abbey	2013-01-31	42	30	12

It's the train wreck waiting to happen that's the charm of this show. Puts a different spin on the old soap opera genre. Makes me look at how much people of wealth have over the rest of us. The Irish guy is the only sensible character out of them all. How such trivial things occupy their minds when you don't have to worry about paying the rent or shopping for food on a small budget. Still like the show, just can't figure out why.	5.0	The have's and the have not's.	2014-01-06	0	0	0

I watched it over a period of a couple of days, as I was hooked.  I do not think I would have enjoyed it had it been so spread out over the years and the ability to watch it all at once really made it enjoyable.  Pretty much a nighttime soap, with modern appeal, that starts off in the early 20th century, and reminds one that the youth of the day will always shake up the world only to be outdone by the next generation.  Pretty much Grey's Anatomy in  the English countryside!  Predictable, corny, entertaining, it definitely fits in the chickflick category.	5.0	addictive	2013-08-13	0	0	0

I mean, really, hasn't the British empire saga been pushed down the throats of every English-speaking country via film, etc. for decades? Aren't we over it? But curiosity led me to stream the very first episode, then the next, and a few weeks later, here I am nearly caught up and ready to watch on a Sunday night with the rest of the fans. I especially love the Irish character named Thomas Branson. As the American wife of a man from Belfast, Northern Ireland and therefore someone who has been around Brits for over 30 years, I am amazed at how well Branson expresses the Irish Republican opinions of that time (when Eamon DeValera and Michael Collins were leading the struggle for freedom), and the Crawleys' various reactions to him.

There are 3 dvds in the case for Season 3.  The 3rd dvd in the case was cracked in half and that was extremely frustrating because I was trying to catch up so I could resume when Season 4 started.  I had to return the DVDs and then do a search for another set so I could watch the 3rd one.  Very frustrating!	5.0	Season 3 Downton Abbey	2014-02-23	0	0	0

It is an excellent program, and I enjoyed it even more watching it commercial free.  The quality of the audio and video was excellent.  However, it seems as though the individual programs were condensed and that critical details were omitted.  Today I watched two in a row.  In one the daughter was attempting to become pregnant.  In the next she was already nine months pregnant and delivered her baby.  I feel sure there was probably a program on the announcement of the pregnancy, etc.  being able to watch all of season three on my iPad has prepared me for the season premier of season four this weekend	4.0	Good series	2014-01-03	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A163939JUY8LSY	jackiejune	Downton Abbey has all the elements that I love: history, drama, romance, humor and a touch of evil here and there just to add to the flavor. It illustrates the changes brought about technological advances and the impact of World War I on British lives.  Old ways of living had to give way to new, albeit reluctantly by some and joyfully embraced by others. However, the best part of Downton Abbey is that women rule it, although they do it with such subtle finesse that the men don't even realize how outmatched they are. The nuances of human behavior are captured with witty dialogue and contrasting scenes between the upper class and those that serve them, all the while showing us what silly creatures we humans can be.	5.0	19th century meets 20th century	2014-02-14	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A30GUWBYTGE48P	Jacqueline Blair	I love to read and watch period pieces.  I don't come from money so have never lived with servants to do all the chores that need to be done in a monster of a home like Downton.  The estate employs a whole village of people.  Imagine living your whole life in servitude.  Eat,sleep and work in the same house.  Looking forward to aspiring to become the Head housekeeper..Things were so different in America, at least for most of the population. I find English life in the 1800 and 1900's very interesting.  Great show.	4.0	History lesson	2013-10-22	0	0	0

I especially enjoy seeing the staff and the family as individuals all different in their thoughts, political views and desires and how they get involved in each others lives while maintaining the strict code of being of service to this amazing family. The first two seasons are available on prime and can be enjoyed at no cost to prime members but if you get sucked in like I did, you'll be happy to pay for season three before its available on prime!	5.0	Sucked In!!	2013-02-03	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2FCXK5EJLK4HN	Jael Isaacson	The whole family is geared up waiting for season 3.  We even rewatch Season 1 & 2 in anticipation.  The actors and actresses are so good.....the characters they play are so interesting.  We watched 'modern' vs 'tradition' and love love love Maggie's role as the matriarch of the family.....And then what happens.....oh yeah...if something good happens, something very evil must happen; and not just once but twice...and what's left ?...No details.  I don't want to give it away but then I should so others don't watch it....my son and his wife were so totally bummed that they are not ever going to watch it again.  My husband and I then proceeded and I had to take some time off because of grief #1 and then the 'finale'.....did the writers forget that we love these characters and without them...the show just isn't the same.  Also, is there no imagination left to continue a story...if that's what happened then Season 2 should have been the end.  We are all disgusted with Season 3 and the lack of imagination and the removal of the 'heart' of the story.  If the writers would ask me, I would tell them that it isn't tragedy that makes a good show...it is the characters...we are interested in the characters and all the actors and actresses were playing their parts excellently.  They make the story.	1.0	Season 3 is not good	2013-08-08	5	4	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3JZ01NKW41K6L	James Alan Love	DOWNTON ABBEY,  Season 1, 2, 3The story has captivated my attention from the first time I saw Season1 on PBS So Cal. Absolutely perfect the way each character is blended with the other. One gets so intrenched with with each story line &#8212; it takes you out of this world of multi-problems and you become a part of the entire cast.  &#34;YOU ARE THERE&#34;  Although I own all the DVD's of all three seasons, I still go back a review ALL of them again.  Each time I catch a line that had been missed, or a scene the had been over looked.  I still watch each program on PBS So Cal each Sunday, although I know what will happen.  Waited impatiently for each season to be released,  The photography is out of this world, the outdoors, and especially the location.  Really enjoyed every minute to date.However, the story can end here. !!!Loosing interest because you have eliminated two (2) of the main family characters. [Sybil Crawley & Matthew Crawley &#8212;Strange]I have lost  interest in the new an younger people that are being introduced. Too much like TV America petty situation comedy (2013)  Ergo, I think you have/are turning a wonderful 'Classic Story' into a 'Modern Day Soap-Opera'... and we all know they are no longer on television. (personal belief)  I think that Julian Fellowes should have stopped after 'Mary Crawley' had her child... &#34;Grandson & Heir to Downton.&#34; Would have been a wonderful 'Cliff-Hanger'Now the story line/s have become disengaged&#8212; Also, Shirley MacLaine did an expected job of playing &#34;Shirley MacLaine&#34; !!!  (The last of the Rat Pack).  Outside of her, every star in 'Downton Abbey' deserves an Academy Award, non of course could top... Dame Maggie Smith.  Accolades to the Cast, Directors, Producers and writers.  Excellent job, enjoyed every minute... viewed over and over!Too bad this is the end for me,  IT Has now lost the magic... and becoming Standard America ; 'Situation Tragedy'.Respectfully,James-Alan Love[First generation American, my parents-grandparents are from England]	5.0	Amazon.com	2013-02-16	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1TJ6LUDYFYLW1	James E. Guthrie	I watched and mostly enjoyed the first two seasons, and the intrigue of seeing early 20th century British culture in HD was enough to pull me through some of the painfully formulaic moments and annoying acting tics (like Cora's accent). But the period novelty starts to wear off by the middle of Season 3, as does any sense that there's an overarching plan to the writing--or at least enough to outweigh the show's business interests. Instead, the plot twists are clearly designed to keep actors they need and get rid of actors (not characters) they can't keep, and it's all too transparent to suspend disbelief anymore or to emotionally invest in the storyline (and if you can't do that, what's the point of watching?). On the bright side, having a show fall off like this gives it a form of closure, and I come out happy for the brief escape but with zero gumption to re-up my interest for Season 4.	3.0	Wheels come off in Season 3	2013-02-21	3	2	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2V95OKPQI0RI0	Janet Camp	If you&#8217;re my age, it&#8217;s pretty much a remake of Upstairs, Downstairs and if it didn&#8217;t have Maggie Smith, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d watch it at all. It&#8217;s full of stereotypes and pretends that people like the aristocratic family were ever so kind to their servants, rather than seeing them as inferior beings--a bit like the supposed kindly slave owner.Having said all that, I do enjoy these period pieces and this one is as good as any in the sense that the Brits do these very well--and there&#8217;s Maggie Smith, of course!	3.0	A bit of a rehash.	2013-12-13	0	0	0

I have watched with awe the brilliant attention to detail and wonderful actor/actresses and writing propel this show to be a continued hit not only in England but around the world.  I can't wait for Series 4.  Sure,  some things in 3 made me sad....I really wish the actor and actress who chose a different path would have stayed on at Downton, I for the life of me can't fathom why you would leave such a popular show that is such an international hit but to each his or her own.  I think it was handled as well as could be given the circumstances...I would certainly rather have Matthew die than him and Mary ""separate"" due to not getting along or some such nonsense and ""easy out"".

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ALV2HNMGQTMM0	J. A. Smith	This series started out brilliantly, but then seems to have had a succession of mini-jump-the-shark moments that want to make you roll your eyes.  There are also so many scenes where otherwise worldly, intelligent, extremely astute characters must become utterly clueless and dumb about the goings-on about them, in order for the plot intrigue to develop.  These devices have now been used so frequently throughout the series that they've become predictable, and tiresome.  I'll probably watch the series to the bitter end, because it's fun in a cheesy way, but Masterpiece Theater it isn't.	2.0	Plot line is on a constant downhill slide	2013-08-20	2	2	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A32EOHLFZYXJEP	Jaylia3	With gorgeous period sets, a wide range of characters, a lot of feel good moments and a few very sad circumstances, season three of Downton Abbey is still one of the most enjoyable shows on television. When the season opens it's 1920, and the ladies of the house are all wearing updated fashions, Mary and Matthew are finally getting married, Edith is hoping for a romance of her own, Sybil is pregnant and may not make it home from Ireland for the wedding, Mr. Bates is still serving time in prison, and Thomas and O'Brien are no longer plotting evil together--they're now enemies.This DVD divides the show into more segments than the PBS version did, which makes it a little confusing if you're trying to follow American blog postings about each episode, but everything is here, including the Christmas special--so named because it was shown on Christmas day in Britain but isn't set during the Christmas season. Instead of a Yuletide celebration show, the family is off to Scotland, a special treat for people like me who are also fans of Monarch of the Glen.	5.0	Another great season--with the Christmas special included	2013-02-19	2	2	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A16X6PP9NIRPDS	jaymibh	Season three was awesome. Not as awesome as season two, but still. I like how Downton Abbey doesn't &#34;jump the shark&#34;, in that when TV shows gets so self-aware of how much people like it they tend to start to sell the characters out. The characters still struggle. They still have real-life situations that turn their world upside down.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2X32LP0GN8L9T	J.

We also thought it would be Episode 3, (so far we had watched 1 & 2), and it was a repeat of Episode 2.  AND we had friends over for the &#34;big event&#34;'.  So there is definite confusion in the description of this show.  Amazon made it right, and support was very swift and excellent in helping me recover my password,  I've mentioned that to everyone I know,  no complaints there.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AZ0XT6JRFQP25	Jen	This series is superb quality in every way.....production, writing, acting.  If you allow eyes to wander, the set design, house and grounds itself are a visual feast.  It is a wonderful way to learn about a period in time when all things changed. The grand homes of Lords and Ladies are about to become more socially and economically responsive. Despite their titiles and wealth, they are no longer insulated from the common man.  It's a fascinating period of change.	5.0	A wonderful viewing experience	2013-12-03	0	0	0
1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1IIAHDJGYR6OQ	Jen	This show is so well written and the acting is outstanding.  I absolutely love it. The photography is beautiful as well. The characters are realistic and likeable. It is wonderful to be able to follow the lives of the Crawley family through another season. The U.K. version is so much better than the PBS version, so I recommend avoiding the PBS version. It is difficult to follow. This is now my favorite show!	5.0	I'm hooked!	2014-01-29	0	0	0
1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2PZUEOCY0XQXQ	Jenmc	"I have given 5 stars to every season however I had to take away one star this season. At the end of the season I begin to see character ""slips"" that didn't quite fit the character.Robert is a great example. From the very beginning he is shown to be a person that always wants to do right as well as be honest and upstanding (sort of an example for the village). In the next to the last episode (the cricket match) he coerces his employees to say and do what he wants,even as his employee tells him that his conscience tells him that he should do what he did. Robert goes against that, and on top of it  makes the employee say that he might have had too much to drink, even though that's not true.I'll be honest, I've already read the reviews for Season 4 because I'm about to start it. I have to agree with some of the reviewers that some of these characters have taken a total opposite turn. I also am aware that this time period did have a lot of change as far as way of life but aren't we from the very first be led to see the Granthams and Crawleys as respectable employers of the village? That they are kind people with money that will do anything to help their employees, even to the point of helping  them obtain other jobs away from the Abbey if it makes the employee happy? I don't think I would think of my employer respectable if I were made to say things that weren't true, as well as implied that I was drinking.Perhaps as one review said, Julian Fellowes has seemed to run out of ideas. Here's one: instead of destroying characters that we love, how about go back to the beginning and show the story of Robert and Cora and him bringing a young American girl to England to live and the struggles she faced when she was young adapting to their way of life? Who knows, it might open the door for better story lines and characters that stay within their character. I start Season 4 with almost apprehension rather than excitement. We'll see what happens!"	4.0	Started wonderful but...	2014-02-18	0	0	0

This takes place at a time when the industrial age was changing things really fast.  Class is not as apparent as it once was and the lower working class is not necessarily staying in its place.  I love this series because it shows us the incredible changes these people went through particularly with regard to the social changes from servant class to upper class/ruling class.

You can imagine my surprise when I learned that I love the most critically acclaimed show on TV. What's more, it reminds me so much of one of my favorite movies -  Gosford Park (which you should watch if you haven't seen it). A peak into the world of the rich and their servants in the early 20th century sounds boring, but the sharp-as-knives wit and humor make it so much more relatable.	5.0	Watch it now	2013-09-10	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2JT0ZZHTPE7E6	Jeriess	I love, love, love Downton Abbey!  With all the reality shows, of which I'm not a fan, and violence in many of the shows on primetime, Downton Abbey takes us back to a time when things seemed much simpler.  Family was most important, they actually sit and talk with each other and they aren't distracted by all the gadgets and electronics that seem so prevalent today.  I love the separateness of the servants and the owners of the home and how the relationships intertwine.  Most of them have such respect for one another, but there are a few conniving characters that make it even more fun to watch.	5.0	Best Show on TV	2014-01-30	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2XQMGE2YY88DC	Jiang Xueqin	The major conflicts that threatened Downton Abbey in Season 1 and Season 2 have fully been resolved.  The heir apparent Matthew Crawley has wedded his cousin Mary, and the Crawley clan is more than ever ensconced in their way of life.  World War I and the ravages of Influenza are over, and Downton Abbey has returned to its normal and happy state of not giving a rat's fart about the rest of the world.  So it's imperative that the show invents/fabricates new tensions and conflicts to keep the slow inexorable train that is the Downton Abbey plotline moving.The major conflict in Season 3 is tradition vs. modernity, the go-to conflict in period dramas when it's clear audiences have little patience for real issues and problems.  The heir and de facto owner of Downton Abbey Matthew Crawley is intent on importing modern business and farming practices to make Downton Abbey self-sustainable, whereas the patriarch Robert Crawley is upset that his tenants may thrown at the mercy of the market.  But apparently Matthew is not at all happy with the Crawley tradition of financially ruining the estate and therefore forced to happily pursue beautiful American heiresses.  Robert then responds that wise investments can save good tranditions -- isn't Ponzi a good investment?The appeal of Downton Abbey is not in its writing (which is lazy and self-indulgent) or in its acting (Elizabeth McGovern is apparently only capable of an expression that's half-chagrin and half-smile -- stop taking that Botox, Elizabeth!).  It's that the people of Downton Abbey are immensely likable, and its self-contained world and all its petty politics and problems a happy relief and escape from our own messy modernity.	3.0	The March of Cliches and Caracatures Continues	2013-12-25	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2Q1EZ2RZU6LH8	Jillian	"I received the DVDs last week and I'm certainly enjoying them.  However, I have one BIG complaint.  I have noticed that at least a few scenes that aired on PBS are not on the DVDs.  (As of today's date, PBS has not even finished airing Season 3, so who knows how many more scenes I'll discover are missing.)I have watched the previous two seasons on PBS and then purchased the DVDs.  The DVDs for Seasons 1 and 2 feature additional scenes that were not aired on PBS.  We know that at least for the first two seasons, PBS edited the program to fit their time slot, and it was understood that the ""Original UK Versions"" of the DVDs contained scenes that PBS had cut.  When my Season 3 DVDs arrived, I was looking forward to seeing all the ""extras"" that had not aired on PBS. It has been very disappointing to not only not find the extras I was hoping for, but to see that scenes and portions of scenes I saw on PBS are missing.  (I have the two ""official"" books on Downton and have read various interviews with the actors, etc.  Based on what I have read in these sources, scenes appear to have been cut even before it aired in the U.K., and the actors and author of the books were seemingly not aware of this.  How disappointing!)In my opinion, it is misleading for PBS to advertise it as the ""Original UK Edition.""  Although this statement may technically be true, based on their experience with the past two seasons, fans of the show have understood this to mean they are getting a more complete version of the season.  It would be great if they would release versions for all three seasons that include EVERYTHING before the final edits were made for British or American TV."	4.0	Love it, but disappointed about missing scenes	2013-02-05	5	4	1

Unfortunately there isn't much attention given to some and it seems to take place behind the scenes (Daisy, for instance). But the mellowing of both Thomas and Mary, and finally the wising-up of Robert (that took long enough!) have been most interesting to watch. I was really saddened and disappointed by the death of Matthew but I guess that is how the British handle an actor's leaving.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1X1CEGHTHMBL1	jjceo	My wife and I became hooked on Downton Abby after watching the first two seasons. It is simply one of the best series on TV today.  The upcoming wedding of Matthew and Mary is taking center stage as the season starts.  This season is so dramatic and the storyline so involved that I do not want to spoil any of it for you.  Let's just say that there are several shockers in this season and it will leave you wanting more.Action, tragedy, love and tragedy make this season so involved.  It is not like you are watching a movie or TV series because the characters are so real that you feel that you are living the storyline with them.  This feeling is brought across the screen and into your home because of the excellent cast and the perfect script that just keeps you hanging onto every event.This is television drama at its best and it is so good that it is addicting.  My wife and I think it is the best show on TV and we love watching it.  We rated it a 5 star series and recommend it to you.  It makes me wonder why American TV cannot make shows like this anymore.	5.0	The best drama series on TV!	2013-03-04	1	1	0

The respect and art of being a gentleman and a lady -- having gotten lost over time I think, is neat to see it in Downton Abbey.  We breezed through all three seasons after having heard about them here and there.  Wish we hadn't breezed through them though.  I wonder if we'll watch Season 3 again before Season 4.  There is a Season 4, isn't there? And, no, I didn't like the ending and what I've heard that means.  Too bad.  :(	5.0	'Nuf Said. I love it.	2013-08-23	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AUQD8A8Y0FB25	J K	A person doesn't watch this series for Action Adventure or situational humor. Maybe it is the lack thereof in this series that makes it such a standout now on American TV. I love this quiet drama. I love the use of language, the nuanced exploration of class and station, and of course, the attention paid to the sets and costumes. Season three begins with a resolved conflict between two of the main characters that went on for the first two seasons, so it feels like major new plot threads are starting and I can't wait to see where the writers take the story. BTW the writer for DA, Julian Fellowes, is the same forGosford Park, so if you liked that movie and other period pieces of early 19th century, you will probably love DA as I do.BTW I watched the first two seasons for free with Amazon Prime with myRoku HD Streaming Player.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2G87N6QZA1BZF	J. Lipoti	I just love hearing Violet (the Dowager Countess of Grantham) make her remarks to her family.  She pulls no punches, takes no prisoners.  She says exactly what she thinks, but so creatively, you have to listen closely to catch the sarcasm.  Her well-placed remarks are a theme that winds through the entire series.  She copes better with change than her son Robert, and supports her granddaughters as they embark upon some modern ventures.  While she struggles with maintaining a certain standard of living with the concomitant price for the high style, she is sensitive to the notion of noblesse oblige, and works hard to be supportive of the entire county.  As she matches wits with Isobel Crawley,and says some unkind things like &#34;doesn't that halo get heavy?, she also reveals just how much she cares for the servants and farmers employed by Downton Abbey. I can't stop watching to see what she will say next.	5.0	Cheers for cheeky women	2014-03-18	0	0	0

Each episode had been so spell-binding that we were sorry there were not enough hours in the day to watch the next episodes.  The historical account of the early 20th century aristocracy along with the servitude of the maids and footmen and the interactions among them was dealt with accuracy and added to the various plots found with these series.

The characters above and below stairs are an interesting bunch. Julian Fellows has created a mostly believable household where not everyone keeps to his or her station. The story begins in the pre-WWI time period and currently takes place in the 20's. Interesting changes in mores and circumstances.	5.0	British nightime soap	2013-02-11	1	1	0

The departures of two main characters meant rather clumsily adding one new one while leaving open the impact of the other's absence.  The cliffhanger aspect works to keep interest piqued for the next round.The interjection of modern social issues was a bit ham-handed, leading some characters to behave in ways that seemed contrary to their established personae.Overall, though, good show.	4.0	DA-S3: really good, but not great	2013-04-19	1	1	0

I am a big reader and often my books cover historical time periods.  I have enjoyed seeing some of the period's subtle issues come to life&#8230;the need for an heir, the affects of the War on a changing society in all classes, women's more independent role, etc.  And I think that he(?) has done a very good job of acclimating the stories to TV given the challenges of characters who do not come back after contracts are done&#8230;. While nothing beats a good book where you can fill in the details with your imagination and an author doesn't have to write off a character because the character is done, Downton Abbey does a great job telling it's story.	5.0	Enjoy the series; brings a time period to life	2014-01-28	0	0	0

This is an intelligent show with a historical setting.  It gives insight into a time when the class structure in British society was so important and when women had few rights.

The drama and tension and love between the characters offers the viewer some nail-biting moments as well as funny moments.  The show truly shows compassion for fellow humans and encourages viewers to take the high road in our own lives.  It is not all polly-Anna-ish for sure.  Displaying the classist thoughts of the era is eye-opening and outright disturbing but no surprise.  Overall love most characters and the great costuming and setting as well as the plot line.	5.0	Addicted to Downton Abby!	2013-10-15	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AEUDHLKGXVJ0P	Joann R.	This was my first time buying a series. It worked perfectly on my Kindle but couldn't get it to play on my computer. As far as the show...loved it until today. One selfish actor with no regard to anyone but himself can ruin an entire Franchise. Place him in the same boat as the writer's and producer's of Merlin who walked away at least 2years to soon. Won't ever get involved in anything the eever have their hands in and anything else he is ever in I suggest we avoid like the plague. Actors seem to forget the only reason they are being offered other parts is because the character they're playing is loved by the pubic. Stabbing those fans in the back shouldn't be rewarded.	3.0	Not sure anyone from Downton cares about our reviews but....	2014-01-19	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A26EQ8U96JA92T	Jody	While Season 3 of Downton Abbey is not as fabulous as the first two, the soap opera-esque writing still sucks you into the addictive show.  There are some great episodes and story lines in season 3 that make it worth watching including the wedding of the year and Sybil and family dynamics.  Of course, there is also more than a few boring stories that never seem to pick up speed (Bates Prison snoozefest).  The surprise ending seems like a lazy writer's solution to a casting issue.  I am not looking forward to the next season as I may have for past seasons.	4.0	Addictive Soap Opera	2013-03-03	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1HVRXGW1Z428Q	Joe Bag-O-Donuts	First, I am NOT a fan of soap operas. Second,  I always found BBC/PBS shows rather rather bland.  Third, period pieces are not my favorites. Downton Abbey has trashed all three of those misconceptions.I tried an episode from season 2 under duress from my wife who heard of it from Jessica D. After that one episode, I was hooked.From the storyline through the ensemble, even the theme. Everything was exceptional. I was amazed at how stark the separation lines between the house and staff were. And yet the affection of the two for each other was obvious. The interaction between the two classes AND amongst themselves is the basis of the series and it succeeds immensely. Humor, sarcasm, intrigue, love, grief and many more emotions are expressed with realism and honesty.I wish I could express how captivating this show is without sounding like a studio flak but suffice it to say there is NOTHING about this show that I don't like.Zo!

It's become less and less about real character growth and the history of the time.  Season 1 was excellent, but after the wedding at the beginning of this 3rd season, I called it quits before some long drawn out scandal, murder, explosion, mass disease, servant cutthroating, or all of those things went on.  However, Maggie Smith's character is awesome in all episodes, so an extra star for her.	2.0	This is the season I stopped watching.	2013-11-06	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AEQ7JPK60NN0O	John A. Maher	Not given to soap opera in either UK or US contexts but wishing to oblige a dear one who had seen the first two years, I bit the bullet but kept iPad near to hand. Careful staging, meticulous costuming, and autos of the period,caught my attention.  Scripting faithful to perceptions, prejudices  and understandings of the time kept my attention.  I confess a prejudice in favor of actors trained in England and Ireland which fondness was not not at all undercut. In any vent, I wtched and enjoyed the whole thing.One tiny thing I wondered about that would have to do with Direction was the spectre of Shirley MacLaine at high table using dining implements as though a Brit. That such a wonderment arose is a tribute to how easily all else went to one not unfamiliar with the UK.	5.0	latecomer to Downton Abbey thoroughly impressed	2014-04-04	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A36O3J8LBEQ768	Johnathan James	Despite the show being consummately British in the tradition of Upstairs Downstairs and Coronation Street, each episode of Downton Abbey is packed with quickly-paced storyline and engaging characters (even the characters that bore you will eventually turn your head towards interest...and even empathy and endearment; Edith Crawley, in particular).  The only quarrel I have with it is that the show must  accommodate for actors who can't seem to commit to a show for longer than 3 years (but perhaps that's just the way some British serial actors work [see the Doctor Who series for that]), which means re-writing storylines to kill off or otherwise remove our favorite characters (I won't spoil anyone).  I still love and greatly recommend this show to anyone who loves period pieces.	5.0	A soap opera of a different kind.	2013-08-20	0	0	0

I'm so glad Amazon is carrying the unedited British version of the show so we can enjoy it as intended.As the season is only a few episodes in, it's hard to rate it as a whole.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AEGYKCHYY809X	John Chandler	"When this series started it quickly earned a well deserved reputation for a new style of period drama. It's success however has been it's undoing as the urge to keep it going long past its sell-by-date is leading it headlong down the slippery slope of ever more boring soap! This is most evident in the final ""Trip to the Highlands"" and for me it is rapidly losing its appeal despite looking better on Blu.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2TUA4VWCMNXI	John D. Cofield	"Like most viewers of Downton Abbey I've been addicted to the series from the first episode of the first season.  The excellent cast, fine writing, and the wonderful sets and costumes make it a ""Don't Miss"" for me.  In Season 3 the noble Crawley family and their servants at Downton Abbey, having survived the vissitudes of World War I more or less intact, are faced with new economic and social pressures.  The world is changing, and the path is no longer automatically smoothed for bearers of noble titles and distinguished lineages.The Earl of Grantham gets things off to a rough start by mismanaging his wife Cora's wealth so badly that he loses it all and faces having to sell Downton Abbey.  His cousin, heir, and new son-in-law Matthew Crawley manages to sort things out in the end, but it's only the beginning. The Earl's daughters Mary (now married to Matthew at last), Edith, and Sybil all continue to have romantic ups and downs, while the Dowager Countess finds her place as Queen of Downton challenged by the arrival of Martha Levinson, the American mother of Lady Grantham. Below stairs the staff continues to soldier on, beset by scandal and romantic turmoils of their own. Eventually tragedy strikes both below and above stairs, leaving plenty of loose ends and questions that will lead to a Season 4 (and who knows how many more?)The fine cast headlined by Hugh Bonneville, Maggie Smith, Michelle Dockery, Penelope Wilton, and Jim Carter among many others has some stellar additions, most notably Shirley MacLaine.  Downton Abbey is over the top, sometimes campy, and with more plot twists and turns than any five or six other soap operas, but it's always sheer escapist fun."	5.0	Entertainment In The Grand Style	2013-06-18	1	1	0

Downton moves forward  in the post-war years and is able to adapt and change, thanks to Matthew, while the pressures of the old ways challenge changes to the household pecking order.

We missed the last 3 episodes due to a trip, but watched the whole season 9 months later on Amazon Prime. This past September we were in Scotland and visited Inverary Castle. While there we saw a display about an episode of Downton Abbey being shot there. It ended up being the season 3 finale episode. It was so neat to think that we had just been there and had spent hours roaming around the house and grounds. But, the last scene almost ruined the whole episode.

ALl my siblings (4) and my kids (2) love DA and we enjoy it in groups. I wish they produced more than 9 in a season. ALL TV should be this good!!!DA is a masterpiece of artistry in location, sets, lighting, production, directing, acting and storytelling. As a program director and videographer I really appreciate the exceptional visual quality, some of the camera moves are without equal. As one who hand held a video camera for a single 9 minute walk through yacht shot on Live TV I know how difficult it is to travel with a camera and rigging hanging from you. The photographers are constantly delighting us with extraordinary long moving shots that are so well staged and choreographed. Buy this series, it's awesome!!!	5.0	Love this series!	2013-02-01	2	2	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AO1RV6XVXGMR4	Joseph S. Canzoneri	I was hooked on the series from the first episode.  The actors, in my opinion, are  perfect for the roles they play.  I love the story line.  I especially love the way they show the closeness of the family.  Showing the discipline of the household staff really gets the point across of what work ethic and loyalty is all about.  Lord Grantham, although an aristocrat, clearly shows what it is to be powerful and yet still be compassionate and reasonable.  I must admit that I was very disappointed that Mathew was killed of in the last episode of season three.  The bottom line is that we need more programs of this type.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3QNNYZAGN82VK	Joshua Anderson	Listen I was a late convert to the 'Downton' but I have been fully convert and am spreading the good news as much as possible. This show isn't just a flash in the pan but has some really good writing and acting. That being said with the amount of s*** that happens to this family, some of it brought on by their own actions but mainly from the outside world, it's getting tough to watch. I like to read and watch movies more as an escape and I don't find anything wrong with that so I'm not one who loves that 'it's painful just like real life'. This show hasn't gotten there but it's well on it's way and if you've watched all the other seasons and specials then you know what I'm talking about. All in all a very watchable and enjoyable series and I would whole-heartedly recommend getting or watching it.	4.0	Great show	2013-12-20	0	0	0

I thought the show was simple about a rich aristocratic family but it's so much more, and has far more depth then I could have imagined.Through the family, the servants surrounding areas you see the changes that take place, not just to the family but also those working for them and even society as a whole. In addition seeing people adapt to technologic changes during that time period, ranging from electricity, phones and even cars, is very enlightening and interesting.	5.0	I would have never thought I'd like it	2013-09-14	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2S3L8XULXNVUV	J.P.	This review is about the series itself.  Downton Abbey is a wonderful show that has developed some fantastic characters both honorable and admirable and also evil and conniving.  I've largely enjoyed the show  to this point, with a few exceptions.  Every now and then the writers will take a character and cause him or her to do something that is completely outside the scope and nature of that character.  This is where the show loses me.  If you establish, for example, that a man is honorable and will go down in flames before he will ever say a bad word about anyone else, then you can't have him blackmailing people in later episodes.  It just doesn't work.Season three started off okay, but ended terribly.  Toward the end of the story, the writers began to alter the characters taking some amazing ones and regressing them and taking one evil one and trying to suddenly make him into an honorable fellow and a hero.  It's not believable.  I'm not saying people can't change, but there needs to be a reasonable impetus or a change of philosophy before that change takes place.I love the setting.  I have come to love and admire some of the characters of this show.  But I quit.  The writers have killed it for me.  Watch season three at your own risk.  If you're anything like me, it will disappoint.	2.0	Downton Abbey- I Quit	2013-03-18	12	10	2

I am totally in love with England, their customs and how they speak.  Watching Downton Abbey lets me revisit England and how I felt when I was there.

"Instead of talking about the plot, and giving away ""spoilers"" I will just say of all 4 seasons, season 3 is the most emotional, packing a punch and keeping you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.This is my family heritage as a descendant of the Spencers and relation to the current Earl of Spencer (who also shares the exact name of my father) at the Althrop estate (where Princess Diana is buried) This beautifully stunning series shows the transition of English aristocratic society from pre WWI up through by the end of season 3 the 1920s. The class differences of upstairs and downstairs is so convincingly portrayed by all the characters. You become invested in the plot, and feel they are some how your own family.The breathtaking historical accuracy to costumes, locations and English countryside alone is well worth tuning in for.Maggie Smith is hysterical with her witty banter as Violet, and I love all the characters.As a gay male myself, it is refreshing to see the development of Thomas Barrow's character played by Robert James Collier. Who handles the difficult role of a man inspiring to move up in social rank, devastated by WWI, and the horrific laws that were in effect in England against gay people.The love between Anna and Bates is both endearing and charming.J. R. is the author of:Lady Liberty: The Definitive Julie London HandbookandAn Historical Study of Kurt Weill's Der Silbersee: Ein WintermarchenThe shocking conclusion still leaves fans spellbound.

There are some sad twists to the Crawley story in Season 3, which I won't detail so as to avoid spoilers. The way Season 3 differs from the prior two seasons is this: when I re-watch Season 3, I skip over certain parts of the story. Though they are well dramatized and the acting is superb, the story line is too painful. I hope that Season 4 will find more members of the cast still with the show at season's end.	4.0	A Dark Season 3 for Downton Abbey	2013-03-28	1	1	0

The main upper class group do an extremely good job acting out their parts and make you like them or dislike them. I am sorry that Robert had to have an afair because he does show that he loves Cora. People feel sorry for Mary because all the bad thing happen to her and are saddened by the turn of Edith's character becoming a woman of the world, she should have a better choice than she is given. The servants are also good in making you like them or not especially Thomas and Cora's maid and John and Anna.

But with each successive tragedy becoming greater than the last, they over-reached in the end.I do not see myself watching the next season, if there even is one. In my mind the show has no further value to me. They had some great writing in this show, but they ended on such a sour note, it spoils the whole experience.	3.0	I loved every episode... but the last ruined it.	2013-01-30	21	17	4

Something deeply psychological about that ending. No one can survive if he successfully usurps the Lord and his leadership. Will anyone mount Lady Mary in the next season, or will she become a saint on the grounds of Downton Abbey?  The acceptance of the gay servant was unbelievable but he is one of the more complex and interesting characters, and one of the only dark characters who enjoys bedeviling their almost boring days in these scripts.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A142ZVEMJJ8CBN	Karen E. Loss	This cast, led by screen stalwarts Dame Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville, is outstanding from top to bottom.  It's rare that such a large troupe can hold a show together and keep people coming back week after week to follow the happenings, but this one does it.  While entirely fictional, it does use historical events and cultural norms from the time period to pepper the plots.  The writing is fine and consistent, even when external events (actors wanting to depart at the end of their contracts) force storylines.  Thus, we lose some loved characters, but gain new ones.I often find British dramas to be slow going and over-burdoned with heavy dialogue.  This one, however, bucks that trend.  Once the viewer gets acquainted with the characters, it is constantly fast-paced and interesting, jumping between multiple storylines, and utilizing the intricasies of each character's development, from conniving and twisted evil ones to lord of the manor ones.  It's simply fun, fun, fun.	5.0	Great Cast, Non-stop Moving and Changing Stories	2013-12-19	0	0	0

The growth of the characters is well rounded and seems very natural.  Even the couple that seem to be parody/stereotypes are believable!They've killed off 2 major characters and 1 minor.  Two of them make sense, the third death was bad/rotten/unnecessary!As soon as I can figure out how to access season 4, i'm there!

I find it interesting that the servants are just as stoic and set in tradition as the aristocracy.  I am in the middle of season 3, and it is fun watching the change in the times and how some characters embrace it while others resist it.

We do find it odd that every time there is a pregnancy, there is some sort of tragedy that comes from it.  Either the child dies or a parent dies or someone is abandoned.  I was disappointed with the coverage of Mary's wedding. We watched her romance with Matthew over two whole seasons and we were all excited for the wedding in season three. With such a long build up I assumed the start of season 3 would be a lavish wedding. The wedding was over in the blink of the eye. No reception, no dancing, no fun conversations. That was odd too. Nonetheless we still tune in and still give the show a 5 star rating.	5.0	Love it but find some oddities about it	2013-02-04	1	1	0

I used to watch this series with my husband, who very unexpectedly passed away at the age of 32 the night that we watch the last episode of this season.  For some time, I was unable to consider watching the show again.  But it is so well done that I couldn't stop, and was able to convince my parents to watch it with me instead.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AYVT89N3AMLS7	Kathleen M. Rogers	I did not watch Downton Abbey until my daughter in law insisted I watch. She downloaded Amazon Instant Video on my IPad and I was hooked from the very first episode.  I love being able to watch Series One, Two, and Three anytime either on my IPad or TV!  Being an Amazon Prime member, I was able to really enjoy the series as the storyline unfolded without waiting a week...or months to find out what happened next!  I am enthralled with each character, even the antagonists like Thomas.  Anna is a favorite but I am somewhat suspicious of Bates.  The deaths of William, Sybil, and my absolute favorite, Matthew, have hit me hard as if they were my family members.  I am ready to start Season Four and continue my obsession with Downton Abbey.  It will really be hard watching Season Five when it returns as I will then be stuck watching it from week to week.	5.0	Addicted to Downton Abbey	2014-03-20	0	0	0

Pippig ""Author of Shape-Shifter Books"""	For quite awhile my brother and sister-in-law have been trying to get me interested in Downton Abbey. I didn't think it would appeal to me, but I put it in my Netflix lineup to watch later. However, Netflix removed it from their streaming selection completely before I had the opportunity to see any of it. While perusing Amazon's Instant Video selection I found they offered the first three seasons free to Prime Members. Recently, I thought I'd watch the first episode of season one and I became an immediate fan. I was addicted! I have been binge watching it and just finished the 3rd season. The 4th season cay be purchased at a good price from Amazon. After watching the last episode in season 3, I realized I HAD to see what happened next, and the rest is history. I have some more binge watching to do. LOL! This truly is a great show, all around - top notch acting, exquisite scenery and cinematography, award-winning writing, and gorgeous costumes complement the period-piece surroundings.

I kept hearing all the hype about this show, so one weekend I decided to rent season 1 & check it out. I now understand what all the hype is all about. I will say this is one of the best shows that I have seen. I am glad that I re-watched season 1, because the rented version had cut scenes. Reading reviews, the U.S. version has cut scenes, so I would recommend getting the UK Blueray version,plus are unable to play the UK DVD disc in our DVD players, so be sure to order the BlueRay version. This season 3 disc also contains the Christmas special. Enjoy!	5.0	Love it!	2013-02-16	1	1	0
1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ATG6HHXCV9YLY	"K. Binder ""BookInhaler"""	This series is an upgraded version of Upstairs, Downstairs.  Very good group of actors and cohesive story-tellking.  Maggie Smith simply tears up the scenery whenever she is part of the action!  It would be wise to start at the very first season and be sure to watch every Christmas show as well.  The third season keeps up with the quality and drama of seasons one and two...no shark jumping here!  Seems as if the quality control is on top of things as the vehicles and clothes seem pretty correct for the time depicted.  But the stories are the meat of the series and the stories are, like real life, full of ups and downs and surprises.

I would highly recommend it to anyone.  One of the things that I most enjoy is that I don't have to worry about my 8-year-old watching it (not that she would-she would probably find it boring).  There are almost zero adult situations, and there is very little violence.  So nice to have a show that I don't have to wait until my daughter goes to bed before I can watch it! :)	5.0	LOVE This Series!	2014-01-16	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A13QZM1V2QPQFN	"Kelly A. Crawford ""Kellydofc"""	"I was so looking forward to Season 3 of Downton Abbey. I thought Season 1 was wonderful and Season 2 was almost as good. So I waited for season 3 with baited breath, waiting to see what would happen to all my favorite characters. The first 2 episodes were great and the season seemed off to a promising start. Episodes 3 & 4 were good, though I thought that 4 was a little shaky plot wise. Episode 5 started out well and ended in being heartbreaking in the extreme, from there on out it was all downhill. By the time I finished watching the Christmas episode I was completely disillusioned. Gone was everything I had loved about the show.Originally Fellows said that Downton would only be 3 seasons and I wish that he had kept it that way because I think we would have gotten a FAR different story line. He let himself be talked out of his original plan, a plan that I suspect was fairly well thought out to begin with, and the resulting confusion and incoherency shows. This season was completely disjointed story wise, some plot lines were carried on infinitely longer than they needed to be (to the point where I was literally sick to death of them) and some were dropped before they were really even developed (the money ""issues"" being a prime example of this). There were even times when Fellows seemed have forgotten his own writing, apparently contradicting information he had given us in past seasons. But the worst was that the characters have morphed in ways that make them almost unrecognizable. I think if Season 1 Branson could see the Branson from the end of Season 3 or the Christmas special he'd drive the Crawley Renault right off a cliff. Perhaps Fellows was too busy working on his miniseries about the Titanic to truly care what was going on with Downton Abbey and since he has 2 more projects in the pipeline it seems unlikely that will change anytime in the near future. I am really left feeling that Fellows now views Downton as the cash cow to be used to finance his other projects and that is the saddest thing of all.The only reason I am giving Season 3 two stars is because the actors are still amazing and the costumes and locations continue to be gorgeous. Sadly neither of these makes me want to watch forthcoming seasons. So season 3 marks the end of my love affair with new episodes of this once great program though I will continue to cherish my copies of Seasons 1 & 2."	2.0	The End of Excellence	2013-01-23	56	44	12

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A37WQCY1LGX7DW	kellyann	Downton Abbey is in the long tradition of British family-servant sagas, in this case,the Crawley family: the earl of Grantham, his wife and three daughters,  who are the owners, custodians, and prisoners of an enormous &#34;great house&#34; in Yorkshire around the turn of the 20th century. Season 3 deals with the aftermath of World War I and the breakdown of the prewar social and economic order. The central characters  masters and servants, are welll-drawn, not always &#34;nice&#34; but usually very understandable. And anyone who can resist Maggie Smith as the Dowager Duchess or Shirley MacLaine as the visiting rich American mother-in-law is lacking either a heart or a sense of humor. As a history buff and fan of costume dramas, I find Downton Abbey to be as satisfying as good chocolate and equally impossible to resist.	4.0	Well-done historical soap	2014-02-09	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A225L541X3BVPI	Ken	"I realize that my lower rating of Season 3 will not be popular. First, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed the entire first two seasons of Downton Abbey. The story lines, scenery, and acting were all brilliant. Season 3 was wonderful as well until you hit the very end of the finale, the ""A Journey to the Highlands"" episode.** SPOILER ALERT ** When Matthew is killed in a car wreck on the way back from seeing his new born son the show just seemed to plunge too deep into darkness. Let's review: Cybil dies after childbirth; Lord and Lady Grantham's marriage is strained greatly as Lady Grantham blames Cybil's death in part on Lord Grantham's decision; much of the season has poor Bates in prison so Anna and Bates are apart; Tom struggles with Cybil's death; Lady Edith is interested in a married man, a man that is married to a women in an insane asylum so for some reason he is unable to get a divorce; when we meet Shrimpee (sp) we find that he is in a miserable marriage; then Lady Mary and Matthew happily great their new born son, only to have Matthew get killed in a car wreck shortly after his son's birth. My point is that Downton Abbey seemed to lose much of its joy during season 3.I hope season 4 will bring back some glimmer of joy to Downton Abbey."	3.0	Season 3: Downton downer	2013-02-15	21	18	3

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AOYYKDQW0R4F2	Kenneth J. Stenzel	We find that this series keeps us interested as the developments unfold. The characters are brilliantly played and one does get a view of how manor houses were operated and maintained. The one area we find objectionable is the homosexual content and try to overlook the patronizing of the gay agenda that so many programs are dragging into their plots. It seems that for such a minority the gays, at times, get top billing. This show tries to keep it tame but we are forced into watching same sex kissing and suggestive situations if we want to continue watching the series. We would love the series otherwise.	4.0	Plot extremely well thought out and developed	2013-09-01	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3RL2LRGQAI5R9	Kerneen Wright	As always, Masterpiece Theater has come through with a compelling storyline, complex and well-drawn characters and wonderful location photography.  Julian Fellowes has captured both the excitement and confusion of the inter-war era when society and peoples' roles and lives were changing on nearly a daily basis.  Politics, a mud fight, possible murder, intrigue, sex, and electric mixers - nothing is a taboo storyline at Downton Abbey.  As an ensemble, the cast is stellar, but Dame Maggie Smith in the anchor role of sly, acerbic matriarch is far-and-away the standout.  No, it's not Austin's light England, or Michener's graphic world history but Downton Abbey is equally entertaining in it's chronicling of life between the Wars.	5.0	PBS does it again	2014-06-25	0	0	0

I can not say enough good things about it.  My wife and I have watched the first season 5 or 6 times.  I am constantly in awe at how well the story flows, how great the actors are, the advancement of the plot in each show.  The only complaint I have is that the season is only 9 episodes!  ONLY 9!!  There should be 90!!  But past that this show is so VERY much worth watching..  OK, I lied, I have other complaints about the show, Season 3 is HARD to deal with.  The changes to the family and the loss of members has weighed heavily on my wife and I.  We LOVE each and every character and to have some ripped away like that is horrid.  We've got an emotional investment in these people.  Perhaps I'm too invested in what is essentially a hyped up soap opera, but it's such a well made soap opera!!!!  GET THIS SERIES!!

After the first episode S1E1, we were like &#34;What do you think?&#34; and we found ourselves saying let's view one more to guage it better!  Well, that's all it took as you started to get a sense for the family member/roles coupled with the Servants and their roles!  Now we've watched the first 3 seasons in the past 2 weeks and are on the 4th season while wishing there was more time in the day to view a couple more episodes!  Overall the series is very good and the characters well orchestrated into the entire story line!  Well done PBS and have enjoyed!  Season 3 is a heartbreaker but, that's all I'll say!

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ALNKJ4BWZMYBZ	K. Kuebler	First, let me start by saying I absolutely am in love with Downton Abbey and was so anticipating my copy of season 3.  It arrived promptly, on the release date, and my husband and I sat together to watch throughout the week.  I will not speak to the story because many others have done due diligence, I'm simply commenting on 3 issues:First, the English subtitles are tiny, really tiny!  My husband is deaf and typically utilizes closed captioning, but since this was available with SDH, we thought it would not be an issue.  The subtitles are very difficult to read, even on a larger TV.  If you are a person who utilizes this feature be forewarned that you'll be paying far more attention to the subtitles than normal and will probably have to watch an episode at least twice to catch all the dialogue.Second, after watching all the episodes on the disc, I thought I'd see how the they compared to the PBS version that is available online.  I started watching Episode 5 and within a few minutes realized that there are portions cut out from the Masterpiece version online (same as broadcast on TV).  One example is the scene with Robert & Cora in her bedroom after the funeral, he says good night, she says good night to him in the online version, that is missing from this disc.  At breakfast the next day there are multiple portions of scenes cut, including some with the servants downstairs and with Branson upstairs.Third, there is nothing in the case expect the outside graphics sheet.  No explanation of how long the episodes are, no episode guide, no description at all.  For such a popular series this is certainly a stripped down version of what is an excellent show.I'm sorely disappointed that I paid to get this disc and now I will be contacting Amazon with my displeasure over these issues. 2 stars because of the lack of acceptable subtitles and the cut version of the series that you'll be receiving if you purchase this.	2.0	Not everything is terrific about this version!	2013-02-04	2	2	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AQ9RTW5BNHRNZ	"Knight68 ""EM"""	I loved the whole 3 seasons of Downton Abbey.  It was especially interesting to me to see how the fabulously wealthy live.  It makes me glad that I am not nearly counted as one of them.  They would never sit down to eat pizza or spaghetti or any other down home meal.  Fried chicken would never be seen nor would cheese steak sandwiches ever be on their menu.  The working people living downstairs work their derriere's off to make upstairs people enjoy their lives.  Personally I enjoy a good pizza with a side of Bud and at times a cheese steak with fried onions is heavenly.  I am not rich by any means and after seeing how the ultra rich live I am glad I am not one.  The show is a study of human nature.  How the workers are charged with taking care of the ladies or the gentlemen.  They don't even have to dress themselves for their maids and butlers are in charge of making sure the Lords and Ladies are dress in clean good fitting clothes.  The show take place in the early 1900s in England.  All that said I have thoroughly enjoyed  every episode .  I am only sorry that Amazon does not have more seasons to offer to their prime members.  This show is great.  Give it a whirl.Knight68	5.0	A very good show.	2014-02-02	0	0	0

While 3rd season is nice, it's not the same level of writing or plot development and terminating the second character (no spoils here) is ridiculous, given all the other circumstances.

Lundgren	"I have read in the Georgian, Regency, Victorian and Edwardian periods, and found the extraordinary level of detail in this show to be compelling.  From Mr. Carson taking out his stick and leveling the silver and measuring the place settings, to the hierarchy below-stairs, to the customs of who will answer the door, to what silver to use for each course, it all rings true.  The clothes are exquisite - no simple rush here - these are pure vintage looks, down to the above elbow gloves.  And the grandeur of High Clere, the actual seat behind the show.  The magnificent grounds.  And the relationships, always the relationships.  Although I would if I could give James the bounce.  This is one to remember.  Having been a fan of Upstairs, Downstairs when it aired, I find this to be even better, although more in-depth into each character, and many more ""behind the front lines"" looks at each character.

The story lines are still compelling but I feel like it has become a bit like a soap opera in that just as one crisis is ending the next has already begun.  (And I'm still mad that 2 main characters were killed off!)Still, I highly recommend the series because the attention to historical detail, the acting, costuming and story line are all excellent.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A36SL1P1YOIXL5	kybrdplyr	Julian Fellowes is either really brilliant or a big turkey heart breaker.  This was a major hankie experience and, beyond that, it would be hard to say anything without revealing a story well worth seeing.  Not quite Dickens, not quite Jane Austen but definitely holding the hardship and personal interludes included in these authors' works.  Up and down and all around the viewer is led:  Downton Abbey is saved!  Downton Abbey is doomed.The characters and their relationships are so well wrought, down to the extant cultural limitations of behavior and manner, with great compassion and surly back biting and everything ordinary in between.  The class differences are blurred with Maggie Smith's character, seemingly so intolerant, the most accepting (and not) with love, care and common sense.  Her life experience, shared by no one else, can dictate nothing else.Highly recommended for a good escape to another oddly compelling planet of life experience.  While Mr. Fellowes may pull some heart strings, sometimes the good cry is worth the tears.	5.0	How Many Could Give This Series Anything Less?	2013-02-03	1	1	0

Turning America into the privilege class and the workers is a step backwards in culture.  There are always things that seem wonderful if you are in the 1% but the other 99% are struggling to survive.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A28029NNK9JB8X	Lance	To be waited upon hand and foot, and have such a sheltered view of how the other 99% live, what's not to like? Of course, we know that it won't last, but it's a great fantasy that captures one's wishful thinking. To me it's escapism at its upmost, much akin to all those dreams one has with a single lottery ticket on a billion dollar jackpot.The casting is superb, and the actors play their roles exceedingly well. Plot twists are expertly woven into the general story line with a democratic sharing of good folks and bad folks among the upstairs and the downstairs characters.All in all a wonderful tale of a magical world.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A33QW5I1JN0SIO	lannie	I just started watching Downton Abbey only about a week ago, and it has lived up to all of the raving reviews that I have heard about it. I don't know why I waited so long to watch it.I watched Season 1, 2 & 3 in a matter of days, because I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen from episode to episode.  It covers every aspect of the good and bad of humankind with a storyline that never ceases to surprise.  The intricacies of the lives of the characters are not lost amongst each other, but bring the commonality between the classes to the fore, while depicting the unfairness and cruelty of a society that leaves those without power behind.  Season Four is proving to be another winner.I would recommend this to anyone.  It has a wealth of history, mystery, drama, humor, sadness, love, cruelty, hate, etc., a variety of story lines, a wide spectrum of characters with whom to identify, as well as an opportunity to get, what is quite probably, a more authentic historical peek, into this particular time of the Victorian era in England.	5.0	DOWNton Lives UP!	2014-01-21	0	0	0

However, the story line does not hold true to how things REALLY were in the early 20th century concerning homosexual behavior. Thomas would have really been imprisoned and not promoted.  Though I understand wanting to relate to society today, the story line does not hold true to that time in history.  It wasn't really until the 1980s that the homosexual lifestyle was more accepted. And even, then, it's only been in the last 15 years that it's become less of an inigma in society.	4.0	Holding true to history versus being relevant to today's society	2013-02-13	1	1	0

I marvel at all the &#34;real&#34; life ups and downs of a generous variety of personalities and status.....with that common life thread that &#34;there are no guarantees in life&#34; that we all have to deal with no matter where we come from or where we are going, we need to be reminded, OFTEN, that life, many times, is not fair, in addition to reaping the consequences of your choices and those personal choices are not isolated to you but affects those close to you and even beyond.... nonetheless we all need to deal with it, most preferably with integrity and compassion ......everyone seems perfectly casted and all do a superior job with their character....the only down side is...since I'm in the middle of season 3, that it must come to an end.....also another life lesson, but I wish it could last forever......just like falling in love!!!!	5.0	Like falling in love!!	2014-05-21	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A8MJX68QCQXIB	LaVerne	This show has drama, mystery, suspense, human tragedy, and comedy.  We see people  struggling with raw emotions in  triumph and in failure.  I have stopped watching. I need a break from the roller coaster ride I just experienced from the height of happiness I felt for the birth of a child to the low of bitter grief from its father being suddenly killed and the pain I know it will cause the family.  I am not ready to face it yet.The story line and characters are true to the  lives that play out for everyday people and hold universal truths no matter ones socio-economic level. I also love its  historical value. I feel truly transported to a time and place in history from which I  have experienced it as it  really was and  from the point of view of the common man and woman to the manor born.  Just fascinating.  I will return to Downton Abbey shortly as life must carry on.  Fortunately I can step in and out as I please in Downton Abby- a pleasure I am sure many of us wish we could do in ours.	5.0	Unforgettable and moving	2014-03-13	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2E44RQF55RW6N	Lee	I and all those closest to me have been fairly addicted to Downton Abbey. I have watched and rewatched seasons one & two, but season three has been a real letdown.  The first few episodes were fairly compelling, but they became more disjointed.  It seems now that the series is ultra successful, primary characters want out, and the only way the writers seem able to accommodate their wishes is to kill them.  Two of the best characters are now gone and one can only imagine what will be coming next.  The 2 hour final episode was choppy at best, underdeveloped, at the very least.  The new romances/relationships were all over the page; Edna eyes Tom, creepy grocer eyes Mrs. Patmore, Dr. Clarkson (a favorite of mine) eyes Mrs. Crawley.  And Rose is a non starter as is her family.  It was almost as if the trip to Scotland was filler because they didn't have any substance. Perhaps my biggest gripe was that the finale left me depressed. I can certainly wait another year for more of this.  Needless to say, my disappointment is stupefying..	2.0	a real downer!	2013-02-15	6	5	1

It is way too good for TV.  From the first season this has been a wonderful show and season three will make you laugh and smile and break your heart more than once.  The setting for the series, the beautiful Highclere Castle, renamed Downton Abbey in the series, is a treasure and we are now entering the roaring twenties, just after the end of The Great War a/k/a World War I.

She wanted the DVD set and reviews suggested buying the UK version over the PBS stating that the PBS version is edited from the original.  We have since purchased the UK versions of Downton Abbey seasons 1, 2, and 3 and we both love the series.  Since season 3 was released a couple of weeks ago, we have only had an opportunity to view the first three episodes of season 3.  The acting and writing, so far, are on a pace to equal the two previous seasons.

Rich, well written, and excellent character development, however, very disappointed by episodes 8 and 9. The story line for Thomas Barrow and those characters surrounding him was disjointed, very contrived and not a historically believable response. Why have the writers given in to modern views on this topic? Have they lost their focus?

In fact &#34;well done&#34; is a good description of the entire series.  The complicated relationships of all the characters set against the post-war changes to the world is a very compelling story.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2XKKBSQIHSUSK	"L. Goodyear ""WYMayfly"""	There is not a series out there that I love more.  It offers the gifts of sumptuous, flawless storytelling, characters who live and evolve, and both art direction and cinematography that I find to be unsurpassed in television today.  One is completely drawn in.  Completely transported.  Each episode is like a stand alone feature film, and achieves a rare pinnacle of drawing out genuine care.  That said, I can still only give it four stars because the writers' cheap low blow made for a lazy cliche.  Sadly, I'll have to sacrifice &#34;was this helpful?&#34; votes by not explaining what I mean.  But If you go on to watch the series, which I absolutely recommend, you'll thank me later for not spoiling.  I'm so angry at the writers...  I may be done watching this series.	4.0	Flawless.

When the 4th season was about to come on, I decided to catch up since many of my friends have raved about from the beginning.  Now, I see why!  Downton Abbey is a wonderful series for so many reasons.1. It is refreshing to watch a program with (mostly) wholesome values and emphasis on family.2. The scenery and costumes are beautiful and add so much to the depth of the show.3. The story is fast paced enough to keep things interesting and slow enough so I can keep up with the multiple characters and their personalities.I have enjoyed watching Downton Abbey very much!	5.0	Beautifully done!	2014-01-15	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A7UVLHHFHL0BL	Linda E. Van Horssen	After the Great War the extended Crawley family, and the many servants who keep the estate running, must adjust to life and change as society changes.  This is a well-acted, well-crafted drama that illustrates the life stories that affect everyone--rich and poor, aristocrat and working class--without distinction. There are secrets, cunning, manipulations, success, loss, sex, love, politics, a murder conviction...  The weekly show is well paced with a well defined story arc that keeps the 48 minutes flowing. This is not a stuffy or boring period piece.  Make your guy comfortable with a pizza and beer...ok, you can step up the beer...maybe Stella Artois, but hide the sherry until your mom's visiting.  After 1 or 2 shows, he will just have to know what's gonna happen...	5.0	This is not your grandmother's period piece...	2013-02-07	1	1	0

This has been a catalyst to my imagination of how changing responsibilities and mores can be so difficult fo some to accept...even now.

By the end of the second episode, I was hooked. Now at the end of the third season, I'm addicted. So much so that one of the characters' personalities has wormed its way into being part of our family's coded lexicon. It's ""O'Brien,"" as in: ""So-and-so would never have noticed such-and-such on her own, except that she's being 'Obrien-ed'."" Ha! Excellent TV for a change!

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2PZDX0VHEB7WT	Lisa	This is one of the best done and most enjoyable series I have ever seen - we're behind the times and watched the whole thing this year, and I was talking about it to everyone - up until the last few minutes of season 3. I really feel like the writers were unnecessarily cruel to the viewer in that final scene, and I can't believe they would end the season on such a dreadful, depressing note. It's colored my whole feeling about the entire series - I no longer am a &#34;fan&#34;, I don't like to talk about downton abbey, and I would really prefer not watch season 4.  We're watching Upstairs Downstairs instead, where if they kill off main characters (at least so far) it's decently offscreen.	3.0	Great!  Until it was really terrible	2013-11-23	1	1	0

Everyone was more kindly than usual, and then...BANG!... jubilant new dad Matthew geta run off the road by a delivery truck and lies, thrown from his open car, down a ravine, eyes wide open and blood coursing down his temple. Mr. Fellowes, you have created one of the greatest drama series in television history, why in hell would you kill off one of the most beloved characters just to introduce a 20-year-old  mindless flapper (Rose)? While your wife (Ms. McGovern) is a fine actress, your script fails to use her for anything other than bland reactions to family crises. You would have done well to kill her off and leave Matthew to captain the family. TOO LATE! I, for one, will not be seeing any subsequent episodes.

Based on a book about a maid in a large household in this time period, as well as Upstairs Downstairs, the classic BBC show, Downton Abbey takes you into the lives of the Earl of Grantham and his family, as well as the staff that work at the Abbey. My husband calls it a period soap opera, and while there is quite a bit of drama, it doesn't quite have the falseness that a soap opera would. You get attached to the characters though, and when something happens to them that you don't like, or don't foresee, you really feel for them. Downton Abbey is great overall.	5.0	Downton Abbey	2014-02-16	0	0	0

I am sure that the quality of production for the series 3 DVD will be just as good as the previous ones, just make sure you purchase the unedited version.Downton series 3 kicks off in splendid style, though I am a bit confused about the time line.  Sybil is expecting and barely ""showing"" and we are told this is almost 6 months on from the Christmas special, in which we were told she was expecting. The early storyline with Edith is also a major inconsistency for me, but I cannot say why without giving things away.  Apart from these niggles, this series is going to be about change.  The world from top to bottom changed after WW1 and this series is dealing with those issues.  I will not tell what's going on, but there are many changes coming for both upstairs and downstairs at Downton. Shirley Maclaine is terrific with the whole cast, but provides a perfect foil for Maggie Smith and the whole show is worth watching just for those two, well they have the best lines anyway. I only wish she was in it for more than the first 2 episodes. The sets, the costumes, the cars, the house are all wonderful and show such attention to detail.  If you're a fan of Downton you will love series 3.  (and it has been announced there will be a series 4!)"	5.0	You'll love it, you know you will!	2012-09-19	504	431	73

I came to find out that actors have personal decisions as to not renewing for another season. The writers really handled this loss of a main character quite well. I have no complaints at all about this series. I watched it on my iPad on the kitchen table during mealtimes. Plus no commercials, what a pleasure.Loved the costumes, location, scenery and everything. I was always rooting for the underdog. You also learn a lot about the social codes of the times, restrictions on women and about manners and protocol. A lot of that is missing today. A better way to understand the past, the difference in classes and the effects of war. So more alive that the dull history classroom books of the 50's to about the 80's.	5.0	"Could not believe the finale. It alarmed my senses. I kept saying ""OH NO!"""	2014-01-03	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1GQAKL9CGQLP1	L. M. Keefer	It is hard to keep the momentum going in a series which is basically about relationships without a bit of either ho-hum settling in or it getting maudlin and soap opera-ish.  But DOWNTON ABBEY seems to avoid those traps and deliver freshness and surprise each episode.  There is enough continuity so you can enter the Downtown world each week and feel at home, and enough novelty in characters and situations to keep it from becoming stale.Season 3 brims with energy.  Shirley McLaine is believable as Lord Grantham's mother-in-law from America and plays her role with dash and panache.  It would be easy to be too campy in that role, but that is avoided.  The three daughters are getting married off which fast-forwards the story-line.  You can't help but wonder what else is going to happen to the family at the beginning of the 1920's.  The costumes continue to delight.I love having this series in our streaming library as my sons like to watch it when they come home.  They like the historical aspects of the show.  I hope this series continues for a long time.  Great job by Julian Fellowes on the screen-writing and production of this enthralling series.  It has the right balance of humor and drama.	5.0	Season Three Dazzles	2013-01-09	1	1	0

Viewing at 9 PM on Sundays doesn't mesh well with our Monday morning schedules so we were positively gleeful to get our Series 3 DVD, advertised as the ""Original UK Version"" on Amazon.  Last night, while surfing the internet on my laptop for Charlotte Russe recipes for next week's viewing party, I decided I needed another peek at Ethel's masterpiece, so I popped over to PBS.org for another look, rather than get up and fiddle with the TV and remote. Of course, you can't just re-watch one scene so...much to my surprise there were Thomas and O'Brien in the corridor discussing Jimmy/James!

Just started watching Season 3.  Love it so far!  What makes me love it?  Most of the characters are sincere and know their limitations.

Looking forward to them making season 4.  It is so popular they must see that it is a best seller.  By the way, it's amazing that they can make such a wonderful series of a movie and no &#34;bad&#34; language.  The movie industry should take notice of this and get their act together.	5.0	Dowton Abbey Season 3 DVD	2013-01-20	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AOCVPRFNS2IKN	Lover of English	Update: I was considering buying this season a second time.  I originally bought it in November 2012 when it became available in the U.K. and then was very angry when I watched it on PBS in January 2013 to find that there were many additional scenes in Episodes 3, 4, 5 & 6 being shown on PBS.  I felt cheated. However, after reading several comments on one of the reviews here it appears that this DVD offering is no better than that I purchased from Amazon.com/uk.  Why there should be additional scenes shown on PBS and not included in the DVD versions is a mystery but many, many viewers are now aware of this discrepancy  and hopefully it will not happen again as the producers go forward with Season 4.This marvelous series gets better and better.  The guiding spirit that makes this production so much more wonderful than others is the fact that the creator, Julian Fellows, seems to have a benevolent view of life.  I haven't encountered this view since I last read the Brother Cadfael mysteries by Elllis Peters (Edith Pargeter).  Fellows has decided to show people at their very best - a most unusual approach to drama.  I think that this is the reason for Downton Abbey's world-wide success.  Dramatic contrast, which is necessary to keep our interest riveted on the characters, means that the Crawley family will continue to encounter adversity, but it is the way that they pull together that makes us care about them so deeply.  I received Season 3 about mid-November and have watched it every day since then.  It is glorious.I do have to complain that Fellows has gone off the rails once again (cf. the trial of John Bates) in the scene where Tom Branson is allegedly given a drink that makes him act oddly.  In fact: Branson, talking with Larry Gray, puts his cocktail glass down and walks away.  Larry puts something in Tom's glass.  Immediately thereafter dinner is announced and they all go in to dinner.  At that time, with before -dinner cocktails being a very new  phenomenon, people did not take their cocktails into dinner.  It's not like today when people are in a restaurant and take their cocktails from the bar to the dining room.  At that time wine was served with every course and everyone would have left their cocktails in the drawing room.  There was, therefore, no opportunity  for Tom to drink the doctored cocktail.  I think it is insulting that Fellows assumes that his viewers will not recognize the impossibility of these scenes.  The trial scenes were outrageous since there was no possible way for the prosecuting attorney to have knowledge of the events that Mrs. Hughes and Miss O'Brian were forced to testify to.  In Season 3 I was delighted to see that the resolution of Bates's situation was well thought out - logically and rationally and totally in character for everyone, so Julian Fellows can stay within the bounds of the possible when he wants to.  I wish he wanted to more often.  Why he allows his near-perfect series to be marred by these digressions into the impossible is a mystery to me.	5.0	Glorious series continues	2012-11-24	1	1	0

You really get involved with the family and all the characters, and to me that makes a great series, when you can't wait to see what happens next, and you don't want it to end.

I just received Season 3 and cannot wait to see it, so I spent two days just watching the series.  I am only giving 3 stars to this item simply because I am devastated with Mattew dead at the end and no returning to the show. I think it is unfair for us the fans that he is not returning.  I know this show will not be the same for me from now on.  Actors should think a little more of their fans and how much it will affect them before making the decision of not returning to the show just because they want to do something else.  We get used to them and see them as an important part of the show and then they leave.  Why not wait until the series are completely done!

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2KH1P5C233SQV	Lydia Gaffney	WWI is over and things are starting to get back to normal except.....everyone has changed.  Particularly the women.  Everything is there from the first two seasons, the drama, the heartache, the triumph  but the war has changed everyone and in a sense Downton  becomes less a guilty pleasure and more of a historical piece.  I love the series but could have done with one more year of dinners and frocks and filtered wine before the war took over.  As the Dowager Countess said &#34;1920! Is it to be believed? I feel old as Methuselah.  When I think what the last 10 years has brought. God knows what we're in for now.&#34;	4.0	Another great season...	2013-03-02	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A10G03UFNWZED3	"Lynda Jean Filipek ""LJF"""	Love the series.  The only thing about the season (spoiler alert) that gave me pause was it's pace and finale.  Some of the scenarios were rushed and I felt the viewers were cheated out of some key moments.  Perhaps it was the versions of the individual episodes that I saw that created the gaps, but then there was the finale which I thought was deplorable!  I could think of better ways to have written Matthew off that would have involved more of cousin Isobel (a somewhat underused source of great fun and interesting entertainment).  The writers took the easy way out.  That was wholly disappointing, I hope season 4 is better because I really like the stories and I am very attached to the characters.	4.0	Historical and Soapy - What's not to love.	2013-02-21	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A5H590TXDSO8	Lyn	This series has all the things we used to look for in our entertainment. The good guys are really honorable. The love stories are from the heart and loyalty is considered a natural part of of everyday life. The villains are easy to recognize and there is no violence. In fact, there is no moment in the whole story that could not be watched by the whole family together.This is an epic tale about a family who stays together as the years pass, war comes and go, fortunes are lost and made again, hearts are wrenched by death and healed by a new generation. I would recommend it to everyone. The cast is superior and the use of an actual fantastic castle in England as the center of the story makes this the perfect series. I wish there were many more like this.	5.0	My favorite Series for 2013	2013-12-21	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1EOH6QI4H0YGX	Margaret Sweeney-Ballou	Although Downton Abbey is fascinating and compelling, I take issue with the handling of several characters, and serious issue with the death of several major characters, especially Matthew in the end of the season episode. His death is abrupt, senseless, and gratuitous to the extent of being manipulative of the audience's emotions. This manipulation is clearly the writer's objective, but I found it to be obvious in a generally subtle show and annoying. In my view, manipulation of the audience's emotions to this extent reduces the show somewhat to an extremely classy soap opera.The first Mrs. Bates' character made no sense. Mr. Bates went to prison to cover for her. All right, why? What was her offense? Did he love her and then hate her? For no apparent reason? Her character was rotten to the extent of being primitive. No suicide for the purpose of blaming the spouse and causing the husband's execution makes sense whatsoever.Lady Edith's being jilted at the altar by Sir Anthony was ludicrous and totally non-credible, especially as we were led to believe he loved her.The soldier Patrick, whose face was mutilated and claimed to be the heir of the family's estate, was handled with crudity and disappeared just when he was becoming interesting and sympathetic in the extreme. This was not explained. It was therefore not remotely credible. A terrific story line was lost, actually thrown away when the young soldier was dismissed so cruelly, especially by the Earl, leading us to suspect him of selfish motives. This was confusing, as Patrick's assumed death on the Titanic was viewed as a tragedy by the family and led to the succession problem which occupied most of the miniseries.The interweaving of the many characters is admirably done in general, but should have been done so much more carefully in some cases.I couldn't believe for a moment the sudden death of the young Turkish diplomat in Mary's bed. Another gratuitous event that strained my credibility to the utmost.The writing is not weak. On the contrary. The writing is so strong and the story so compelling that I was severely disappointed by the above mentioned events. I don't like to be manipulated, especially when I'm otherwise enjoying the show immensely.	4.0	I like it with serious reservations	2013-02-18	4	3	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3MGNPREYUMT83	Maria Gonser	I gave Downton Abbey 5 stars because I  have been hooked since Season1.  My mom told me about it and at first I was hesitant, but decided to give it a try. Wow, am I glad I did.  I had just finished reading Canadce Camp romance novels which take place in Europe, very Jane Austin like, but with hot and heavy love scenes. Because I was reading of an era long ago with Earls,Lords,Butlers,Maids, and young women needing to find a husband while attending the Ton, I was in the mood for Downton Abbey.  The scenery is amazing, the music is fantastic, the acting superb, and the plot is so good, I can't wait to see the next episode.  My husband, who favors action thrillers, is even addicted to it. The only thing I don't understand is why the uncut U.K. version isn't aired on PBS. I don't know the difference, for I have only watched the uncut versions because I buy it on Amazon so I can watch them anytime on my Kindle. In a nutshell, I love it!	5.0	I am addicted!	2013-02-01	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2TM2CB7KS85MD	Maria	So many had told me about Downton Abbey and I just kept putting it off, thinking it's just another show on TV, probably a story line I have seen over and over again, no need to rush and see it. Than one day I got on Prime and said let me see what all the fuss is about, Well say no more.. There is no other show like it on TV today, just absolutely love it and all its characters, amazing story lines, the scenery is spectacular, wardrobe makes me just wanna live in the Edwardian era. I am currently on S3 and trying to stretch them so that I DON'T catch up too quickly would hate a Saturday afternoon without my Downton.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ASI1POQ1IXG9X	Marianne Kaczmarek	Loved each season of Downton Abbey. I didn't watch the series when it first started so watching each episode of season 1-3 got me up to speed.I love the story line of the family during times of war, bad investments & into a more modern time. The clothing is exceptional as well as the picturesque scenery and castles. The automobiles are quite elegant & proper for the times.. I've grown to love the downstairs help as much as the kind & caring upstairs rich family. Love how the family has a English point of view that sometimes fights the American side that is shown in the Abbey's mother as well as her mother. Maggie Smith is quite a dame to watch. Her expressions & pauses just add to the very prim & proper English style. With the addition of Shirley Maclaine as the American material grandmother, I can laugh at &#34;our&#34; differences to that of the Abbey's inhabitants, whether downstairs help or upstairs upper class.I can't wait until season 4 commences in January! But I'm sad to see the two very painful deaths of the sister and husband of the eldest daughter. I'm still waiting for the 2nd daughter to finally find some degree of happiness in a marriage or maybe even a love affair!	5.0	English drama	2013-09-07	0	0	0

The characters are well thought out and you are slowly introduced to what makes them tick.  You may think that you have a keen dislike for a character and then surprisingly feel sorry for them as the storyline expands.  Do not get too comfortable  with a particular character as they may not be there for the following show.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1EHZL068JA3CH	Marilyn	I fell in love with Downton Abbey from the very beginning and enjoyed Amazon Prime's availablity of the full English version of the season one and two...so it was a no brainer for me to order season 3's preview and I am waiting impatiently for the full release of Season Three.  I gave this product a full five star rating, not only because I'm a huge fan of the series but because Amazon makes the English version available to us that's a big plus to me.  If you enjoyed Season's one and two on PBS...then you will be thrilled with Amazon's offerings of both seaons and the new one coming in January.	5.0	A Big Fan Review!	2012-12-20	1	1	0

I wind up speaking with a British accent after watching these again and again.  The best part is the high-brow humor and the cattiness between the characters.

The clothes, the cars, the setting and the architecture are great.  But at the core of Downton Abbey, it's a soap opera.  It has more in common with JR Ewing than it does with JP Morgan. I wish them well, but be forewarned: the cliff-hangers and interpersonal drama drive their stories, not the historical drama.	3.0	Historic Soap Opera	2013-05-28	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3MN0XB12FIWHF	Marlu17	It is such a great show with a leaning toward more tragedy --that would be my only criticism.  Can this family or any of these characters ever get a break?  One becomes emotionally involved with the characters and so the sadness at times becomes personal.  This is why it is so good as well.	5.0	Incredibly satisfying until last episode	2013-12-22	0	0	0

The script is well written and transcends the viewer to the period in time and effortlessly takes you through the changes in time and tradition.  Well done.If anyone is just finding Downton Abbey you must see Season's 1 & 2 as you will better appreciate Season 3.  As Season 3 introduces Cora's mother (Shirly MacLaine) to the audience I was somewhat disappointed.  Ms MacLaine's dialog seemed ""forced"" not ""natural"" (in another sense it comes across as ""acting"").  I hope that this will change, as I am so looking forward to when the three (Matthew' mother, Grand Ma Ma, and Cora's mother) are in a scene together.  I can only imagine the jabs with such jest!!  Grand Ma Ma (Maggie Smith)is such a delight.  I find myself on many occasions laughing out loud at her retorts.Eagerly anticipating episode 2."	5.0	Fabulous series.

Season 3 begins in 1920 with the wedding of the earl's oldest daughter to his distant cousin and heir.  This is Britain. Girls can't inherit.Spoiler alert: two major characters die during this season.Wonderful costumes and sets are part of the joy of watching.Dame Maggie Smith as the dowager countess is a gem.Technology gives an added bonus.

Neither can I resist judging the stiff upper class that has its problems simply by being upper class. The servants and their lives are suspenseful and far more interesting.  After the World War, however, life as the upper class knew it will never be the same again. The lower classes work for themselves and succeed in their own right, and the upper class has to scramble in order to survive.I love the character of Maggie Smith.

Neither group escapes troubles. Both use each other to gain helpful information.  It is great to see how much real caring takes place in spite of backstabbing.  Characters well suited for their roles.I have already recommended this series to my friends and family.	5.0	Family Joys and Sorrows	2013-08-20	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A9QCYYGPYHRN7	Mary E.	I ended up buying this set about 2/3 of the way through the PBS run of Season 3. The fact that they are marked &#34;Original UK Edition&#34; led me to believe that these were more definitive editions than those being broadcast in the US right now, with additional footage. Nothing could be further from the truth! These have whole swaths of dialogue and even entire scenes missing as compared to the PBS episodes, often making the story less clear or reducing the impact of scenes that were set up earlier, in scenes that are now missing. These actually watch like a dumbed-down version of the Downton we know and love. I was extremely disappointed and I cannot recommend these discs to anyone unless they have no other option for watching the series. It also makes me very wary of purchasing anything from PBS's DVD label in the future, if I cannot trust them to present their shows in an unedited format.	2.0	Don't waste your money.The episodes are edited, badly.	2013-02-10	2	2	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3NWRKN65YCQUZ	"Mary Jane ""Mary"""	I love Downton Abbey, and all of its twisted little plots both Upstairs and Down. I had recorded each of the shows from season 3 and 4, and by mistake I deleted the finale of season 3 (showing the death of Matthew). So I recently ordered seasons 3&4 to go along with my earlier purchases of seasons 1 &2,  That's just how much I like the show.  And It would be nice to see the show evolve into earlier developing times in America when families of great wealth like the Astors, Vanderbilts, Morgans, and Rockefellers held great wealth, properties and businesses that made America grow into our present day great strength.And I never will forget in this past season 4's finale when Mr. Carson, (DA's Butler) dressed in a full set of tails, turned and started to conduct the orchestra at Lady Rose's Presentation ball as she was led into dance by none other than Prince Edward (the later on, advocated King).  That was an absolute BLAST that still gives me a chuckle when I think about it !	4.0	I had to have Downton Abbey's, Seaon 3	2014-03-11	0	0	0

Every character is interesting and if the character isn't interesting, it's because the writers have made that character interesting YET. As people, we are taken through trials and joy in our lives and it is no different for this group except it's set in a time so different than our own which makes it all the more intriguing. I wish the series ran longer in a season than it does, but I guess it doesn't matter because millions are coming back for more after months of waiting.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1QO29GBXI2ZNR	Mary Louise Austin	The character evolutions (or in some cases devolutions) are noticeable, especially when more characters are introduced. This, without doubt, is one of the finest productions to come down the pike. The music is memorable and immediately recognizable. It was a great thrill to hear Scott Joplin again, as brief as it was. The one character (no name needed) who seemed to cause an immediate uproar from reviewers in season 1 continues to gain attention until one realizes his homosexuality is his only redeeming value.It may be noted his perceived 'evil' is probably the result of his treatment by society in the early 1900's.	5.0	evolving	2014-02-15	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A39PLT1L94ODU2	Mary-Lynn from Boston	Through Amazon Prime I have been able to watch the entire Downton Abbey series from the first episode of Season 1 through the last cliffhanger of an episode of Season 3 in the span of 3 weeks.This is an amazing series! The portrayal of the Earl of Grantham (played masterfully by Hugh Bonneville) and his family in Yorkshire as they move from pre-WWI though the war and into post-WWI is indeed an historical masterpiece.I greatly enjoyed the elaborate  portrayal of Downton itself as a living entity, kept alive to maintain the rich tradition of the pre-war countryside estate.The mansion is glorious in its decor. The costumes are exquisite, changing with the times over the course of the series.The best part of the series, in my opinion, is the character development. From  the Crawley sisters down to the lowly kitchen maid, each character is given life and dimension, fleshed out by subtleties such as Lady Mary's Mona Lisa smile and beloved Butler Carson's barely audible groans of disapproval.The relationship between family  and house staff is fascinating. Two distinct classes, co-existing in the same house, totally inter-dependent yet seperate. The ladies' maids and the men's valets have rather charming personal relationships with the family member they serve. They assist in dressing, grooming, and keeping the schedule. Yet, unspoken is the role of confidant and companion to persons who lead a grand but often lonely life.Another dimension of the series I enjoy is the intrigue that goes on among the &#34;downstairs&#34; staff. Not as refined as their &#34;upstairs&#34; counterparts, many resort to sabotage and deceipt to get what they want....  a better position among the staff or the affections of another household member.I would be remiss if I did not mention the beautiful outdoor scenes in the series. The land surrounding Downton is lush and green. In Season 3, the family goes to the Highlands in Scotland to visit. The tour of the Scottish countryside is breathtaking.I am so glad to have the availability of this wonderful series at my fingertips through Prime.

When I tried to watch tonight, I received message that the web page was not found on Amazon site. After searching site for 30 minutes, I finally found a place to contact Amazon.  There I received notification that the site was having technical difficulties and to try later.  I just tried again and now the video series doesn't even show in my account any more.  I am furious after paying $14.99 that I can't watch it.  I will try for a refund of the episodes I haven't watched.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1R2O9AYYISZOU	Melissa Miller	I really love this show. However the ending was a little much. Spoiler alert! There is no reason to make another person die off. Yes, it helps the show to be more dramatic, but that doesn't mean that no one in the family can have a happy life. One pregnancy with a death was enough, speaking of Sybel. Should've left Mary and Matthew alone, there was enough drama already with them. But I'm still looking forward to next season.	5.0	great show	2013-09-27	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3KEZLJ59C1JVH	Melissa Niksic	"""Downton Abbey"" is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I am giving this season four stars because I am super critical. I feel like this season, while I still enjoyed it enormously and it is far better than pretty much anything else on television, was super predictable and contrived. I am not going to post any spoilers, because the emotional impact of this season packs quite a punch and everyone deserves to enjoy that in full without being spoilers. My main issues are that, for example, the final event that happens at the very end of the bonus/Christmas episode is something that both my husband and I predicted right down to the letter...and we predicted it during the second episode. That's how much obvious foreshadowing I think there is in the various plots this year, which is a bummer. Sometimes the storylines are so obvious, the dialogue so contrived, that it just takes away from my enjoyment of the show as a whole.Another big disappointment--HUGE--is Shirley MacLaine's character. When I found out she would be joining the show, I was thrilled. ALl I pictures was Shirley and Maggie Smith trading zingers back and forth with a vengeance. Sadly, Shirley's role this season is pretty brief, and her character is much more watered-down than I ever imagined. I am stunned that her talents were not put to better use, and that more effort wasn't put into giving her a more dynamic character. It wasn't a bad character or a bad performance, but it wasn't at all up to par with what I was expecting. I think there was a huge missed opportunity here.That is NOT to say that this is a bad season at all. It's not. It's fabulous and I enjoyed every second of it (well, except the horribly depressing parts, and I am warning you all, there are plenty of those). There are some great storylines, many surprises, and so much emotion. In terms of each character's individual stories, I think Season 3 has been the best season by far, at least as far as individual character development goes. Viewers will be emotionally rocked to the core (and totally depressed) more than once this season, and I have absolutely no idea where next season is going. But, as always, I can't wait to find out.As for the boxed set itself, it's fabulous. Great design, helpful chapter titles, and great special features packed into three discs. You won't be disappointed."	4.0	Four stars for this five-star show	2013-01-30	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	APNLFE7D7ZQZA	MelissaT.	I love Downton and my only complaint is the space between when the show runs in the UK vs. when it runs in the US. Because during that timeframe I already know the entirety of what happens in the series, since the UK news blasts headlines without putting spoiler alerts. Because of this I didn't get through half of season 3 before stopping, as I found it almost boring since I knew what was coming. Definitely takes away the impact of the great show Downton is. And I do love the ease of ordering it from Amazon.	4.0	Hard to stop watching	2013-03-18	1	1	0

Within 2 weeks, I was caught up; had streamed and purchased every episode from the beginning.I love the historical perspective and the opportunity to peek into the 'proper' life they lived (both upstairs and down).  The cast of characters are endearing, lovable and sometimes despicable - but each personality is well defined.  I want them all to  live happily ever after: Robert with Cora, Mary with Matthew, Mr. Bates with Anna and what about Mr, Carson with Mrs. Hughes?  Sounds good to me!

Robert is worried about the heritage and his dwindling estate...he has no sons, but three daughters with his wife Cora (Elizabeth McGovern).When season one opens, his nearest male heir, the apparent beneficiary of the estate, who is the fiance of his eldest daughter Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery). The next closest male heir in line is a distant cousin, Matthew (Dan Stevens), a lawyer who doesn't really have any interest in the estate. Convinced by his widowed mother Isobel (Penelope WIlton) to move with her to the estate from Manchester, Matthew is supposed to marry Lord Mary. His rather modern-notioned mother clashes with Violet Crawley, the Dowager Countess of Grantham (Maggie Smith).As if the dwindling estate and his daughters marriage is not enough of a story line, the viewer is treated to the lives of the servants of the estate as well, almost reminiscent of the earlier, very successful BBC program, Upstairs Downstairs.	5.0	Downton Abbey has it all... drama, romance, great acting and script	2013-09-07	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AN60ZEKZ13NA	MICHAEL ELDRIDGE	I am normally not the type of TV viewer who goes in for poofy British dramas about snobby, erudite men who can't dress themselves, but still wear tails every time they sit down to dinner. But for some reason this show has drawn me in. I have grown to know the characters and genuinely care about what happens to them from episode to episode. And there is no shortage of sub-plots and twists to keep me interested. For a guy whose favorite shows are Rescue Me, Breaking Bad, and Sons of Anarchy, I have been surprised at how much I have enjoyed all three seasons of Downton and I am looking forward to the fourth season with great anticipation.	5.0	Surprisingly Good!	2013-09-18	0	0	0
1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2XAHEQG61OQN1	Michael Everett	As a retired Hollywood gaffer with 40 years of film/tv lighting behind me, and a an eye trained to oberve every detail of what I see on the screen, I'll skip the more general reviews to say this: Downton Abbey is the absolute state of the art in every production aspect -- lighting and cinematography, art direction, wardrobe, sets, hair and makeup. Downton was shot with the greatest of care and must have had a huge budget. Even the hair styles, which I rarely judge, caught my eye. Each character has a style that reinforces who they are, an example being O'Brian's frumpy hair style which perfectly matches her conflicted character as an obsessive gossip and trouble-maker, and combined with her subtle make-up conceals the fact that she's actually an attractive woman. Assuming the interiors were shot on stage, the sets were flawless. The wardrobe, as it changes over time to keep up with fashions, is as good as it gets, and the wardrobe budget alone must easily have exceeded the cost of producing a low-budget feature. Of all the global centers of film/tv production, only Britain with their great cinematographers and seemingly inexhaustible supply of talented actors provided by their robust theater tradition, can match Hollywood or New York. When I watch Downton, I can look right through it and see the great craftsmanship and hard work behind it, so here's a tip of my hat and a raised glass to my fellow film/tv workers of Britain who labored so long and so hard to create this fabulous, perfect production.For those Downton fans like myself who want to dig deeper into the details of being &#34;in service&#34; take a look at &#34;Manor House&#34;, another British series that some British friends recommended to me. &#34;Manor House&#34;, a six episode sort of reality hybrid, available on Amazon Instant Video that takes a handful of non-actors, outfits them in period wardrobe and puts  them to work as servants in a Scottish manor for six weeks to explain the historical background and look deeper into the fascinating details of their jobs, their restrictions, and the elaborate protocol to be observed between upstairs and downstairs. &#34;Manor House&#34;,	5.0	Six Stars for Downton!	2014-01-03	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3PPF6UPVNW04U	"Michael Gantt ""xrayzebra"""	Unless I can go back and take stars away from things I've already given 5 stars, this program breaks the 5 star system for me.  I did not think that any television production in the 21st century could portray such humanity.Unless you really hate costume period pieces; romances; great acting; incredible lighting, make-up, costumes, antiques, art,  classic British autos, and historical realism, you should find something to like about this show.  Even if you are something of a misanthrope, you'll find yourself empathizing with the characters as real people.If there was one possible negative criticism, it would have to be a politically oriented one, perhaps centering on the gentle, nostalgic portrayal of an aristocracy that had outlived its usefulness.  But then again, they were a historical fact, aptly portrayed here in their splendor and human frailty.  It would be a far reach to criticize this absolutely sweet and stirring drama for somehow glorifying or trying to bring back the problems of this era.  While possibly romanticizing the wealth and power of the few, it does remind us of the horrors of the era - the brutality of WWI, the mass death of the influenza epidemic, etc. and it often brings us hopefully back to the present with it's treatment of progress on social issues that persist to this day.My wife and I watched all 3 seasons of Downton Abbey over a period of two weeks.  It was one of the very rare times that we have ever sat spellbound in front of the boob tube for 8 hours straight over a weekend.  We did tune in for the last 4 minutes of the Superbowl afterward - but only because it was about time the Ravens won!  :)	5.0	Six stars	2013-02-04	2	2	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A14YP1L3N8ZNMC	Michigan Parents	Like the scenery and the food.  Enjoy watching all the various outfits.  Otherwise this show is no that good.  When a baby is born a main character dies??  Even the smart arsed  &#34;Grandmama&#34; played by the wonderful Dame Maggie Smith (will she be 80 yrs old this year!) remarks are becoming predictable and boring.  Miss goodie two shoes from downstairs was so sweet and kind at the first has just gone over the edge for me.  She and her husband have become sickly-sweet to me, all though I do still like them (probably my favorites of the show).  He is a bit more street smarts, which I think will save their marriage in the end and they will go far, once they get that farm.  I absolutely hate Lady Mary and wish she would have died instead of Sybil...in fact, I think an interesting plot turn would have been for Sybil and husband to both survive their daughter's death, but for some reason stay on as regulars at the Abbey, then Lady Mary have her little boy (and still have that &#34;perfect&#34; look), but she and her husband get mauled by an escaped circus bear while walking the grounds of Downton!!  Ha!  that would be a twist!  Then Lady Sybil and her husband would raised Mary's child and their own as Roman Catholic cousins!!  LOL...then when they grew up, they would marry then the chauffer would become the true leader of Downton Abbey!!  What a show!  You may wonder why I even bother to watch this show...I figure if it's good enough for my president, his wife, all my friends and relatives, then it should be good enough for me.

My daughter could learn a little history without force (like putting spinach in brownies), and the grandparents could delight in the costumes, cinematography and the whole 'Englishness' of the series. Of course anything by Masterpiece has been good but this is GREAT. I plan on purchasing all the season and giving the as gifts for my families. Yeah to the producers of this show. We love it and I wait each week for the new episode. I have several of my freind hooked as well. This is good, quality family television.

The character development is so intriguing and so well written. If you love period pieces, this is for you. I can't say enough about  Season 3. I had to watch it all within a couple days, it was that good. I will be watching it again. In fact I thought I would invite the  family for a &#34;Downton Abbey Immersion Weekend&#34;.  The costumes, the set decorations are superb. I don't know which is better, the story of the Crawley family or their servants.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AMVV4VAH4X5TO	Mikeboi	Downton Abbey ranks among one of the best series I've ever seen. It has everything you could ask for in a phenomenal show. I found myself deeply engaged and connected with each character, and my fascination never receded. I wanted to watch ever episode but sometimes using Amazon Instant Video I would force myself to go a couple of days before starting the next (just to add a little suspense). I didn't think this show would be all that good, but upon reading and seeing such high reviews and ratings, I thought I must give it a try. Seasons 1 and 2 were magnificent and I couldn't wait to watch season 3. It too turned out to be another hit and didn't let up on the drama of Downton. But the ending was a sheer jolt. I was flabbergasted and highly disappointed with the way season 3 ended, and I mean the VERY end. Overall it was well worth the watch.	5.0	I started watching and COULD NOT STOP	2013-10-02	0	0	0

The history is right, the costumes are right and the actors take a good script and make it great.  Over all of this looms the silent character of the house, that like some demanding and petulant elder, demands so much of the Crawley family and staff.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AY5D5IR23NI33	Mike Kinney	After hearing so much about how amazing 'Downton Abbey' is, I decided to see what all the fuss was about.  So, I watched the first episode.  Then, the next.  Until finally, I watched all of season one in just 3 days.  Yep, it's addicting and here's why:I consider Downton Abbey one of the best television series to date.  It's a refreshing storyline to watch as it explores an era that has barely been seen in an entire TV series. We are introduced to many fictional characters who take us through a nonfictional world. The historical timeline of events that are brought up in the series gives us a new look into what life was like back when the telephone became a greater deal, when women began discovering the right to have choices, and when World War I created a transition into a different and unsettling world.The writers also do a fantastic job in revealing the perfect amount of back story and depth to each character and I absolutely love that we have the chance to get attached to characters from various backgrounds.  I also think that this show could not have been casted any better.  There is an exceptional range of talented actors and actresses that do an incredible job developing their characters throughout the series.If you haven't watched 'Downton Abbey' yet, then I hope my review has convinced you to see what all of the necessary excitement over this show is all about.	5.0	An incredibly addicting TV series	2013-08-24	0	0	0

I truly enjoyed each episode.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of the one who die in the final episode (I don't want to ruin it for those of you that have not watched it).  Why, Oh why, did he have to die?  I was so upset that I said to myself I would not watch season 4.  Of course, I broke down and watched it last night.	4.0	Outstanding	2014-01-07	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3890841FO8CT0	MJS81	Great show... just discovered it this year and we've already caught up through Season 3.  Each season just keeps getting better.  Better yet... no commercials!It's all about a great story line that keeps your interest... a great setting that is very authentic and very good acting.  It goes to show that they can make a compelling and popular program without a lot of graphic violence or in-your-face sex.  Not a prude here by any means but increasingly find that some of the over-the-top graphic blood and guts on show has gone beyond anything necessary and rather distracting from the story (or maybe it's to cover for the lack of a story).  In any event, it was rather refreshing to see a program like Downton Abbey that keeps your interest simply with a good story, authentic setting and strong acting.  Kudos to PBS and those brits.Can't wait to watch Season 4.	5.0	Must See TV	2013-12-11	0	0	0

This show has clever writing, interesting characters, and intriguing story lines.  And the way they dress is cool, too.  I'm an actor and was in &#34;Winter's Tale&#34;, a period piece movie coming out in 2014, and this is how we dressed in that movie.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2ZSUIGBPVGKHN	Moira	After waiting for several months, Season 3 is finally getting underway with more intrigues, suspense, unexpected twists and turns, subplots............all the things that make Downton Abbey a program that keeps one anxiously awaiting the next episode.Although I've only been able to watch the first 3 episodes of Season 3, it hasn't failed tailed to keep me on the edge of my seat wondering what is going to happen among the inhabitants of the Abbey, both aristocrats and downstairs servants. There's plenty of exciting things going on among the Abbey's residents. The addition of Shirley Maclaine as Lady Grantham's American mother stirs up plenty of new excitement and contention among the family with her sarcasm and disdain for the stuffy ways of the English aristocracy although she proves to offer a novel solution to the Grantham's spur of the moment dinner party disaster. Lady Mary continues to be headstrong and even takes a stand against her mother when Downton's future seems doomed, offering a glimpse of just how deeply English tradition is ingrained in some of the Granthams despite a seemingly hopeless future for their privileged way of life.

I don't know what it is about the characters, but they draw you in and you can't wait to see what happens.

The sets, the locations, costuming, everything about this show is great.Except all the characters are petty jerks. The aristocracy are so concerned about their stupid money and social standing one just wants to smack every last one of them hard in the face. I know, ""people of their times"" blah blah. They're all jerks.The help are a bunch of hysterical, sycophantic, two-faced ass-kissers. I think its possible they are even more pompous and insufferable then their ""betters"".

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AN82SJNDOKDBW	M. Rickey	"This might be the original U.K. version but it is not the ""uncut"" version shown in the United States.  The DVDs do not include some scenes that were shown on air by PBS, including Daisy's first visit with Mr. Mason and the downstairs talk about baby formula.  Each of the three discs is bookended by that annoying Ralph Lauren commercial.  It pops up when you push ""play"" for the first episode and ends the last episode on each disc so it is almost impossible to avoid, but you can fast forward or skip over it.  Let me say that outright commercials embedded in a DVD set I bought and paid for is pretty unforgivable - especially in a set put together by an ostensibly commercial-free station.  The final Highlands episode is included.  This set is okay to scratch the Downton Abbey itch, but purists might want to wait for a deluxe version that comes from the producers."	3.0	PBS's DVD review	2013-02-03	18	16	2

Other than the fact I suspect most Americans cannot understand the incredible attachment to a house, the series is a marvelous look into one of my favorite periods of history - early 20th century in one of my favorite countries -England.  The interiors, the flowers, the style, grace, manners all so marvelous to watch.  Extremely well acted, I've now gone on to binge watch all three seasons and the first episodes of Season 4.

It's also intriguing to see the societal changes from the end of WWI and the changing economic picture of the early 1920's and the effects on the grand estates of the gentry.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A14MZSYWNQ8TFB	Nancy	I only just started watching Downton Abbey. So I watched all 3 seasons in about a week! In true PBS-style, everything about the show is top-notch: the directing,casting, acting, set design, etc. The quality of a film, rather than TV. I was devastated at the end of the 3rd season with what happened and I'm not sure if I'll be as interested in the show next season with the change (don't want to give any spoilers!). But most likely, I'll still be hooked.	5.0	As addicting as everyone warned me. . .	2013-08-29	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3GZ0PGYV07BI8	Nancy	This show has become an addition to my husband and I.  We hate that we have lost one of the characters that we most loved and I must say, I stayed awake for hours mourning the loss of the latest character!  This show does not pull any punches, the characters are honest (to a fault sometimes) and speak the truth when asked questions.  It never leaves us wondering &#34;why the heck didn't you tell him why you did what you did&#34; - oh, except for the honorable valet!!  Great Show!`	5.0	Downton Abbey	2013-08-26	0	0	0

Not only are we intrigued with the lives of the early 20th century wealthy, but involved with the everyday trauma and drama of the servant class. While many of us are not maids and butlers, we just love to identify with their struggles.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3N0OINVM9NVB2	Nathan S Humphries	To me, Downton Abbey is a &#34;cool&#34; version of Pride & Prejudice. Yes, it's a lot of relational drama, but it's done so incredibly well (and to me, more interesting) in comparison to Pride & Prejudice. As a guy, Pride & Prejudice seems to be a bunch of women walking around talking. That's it. Downton Abbey is different in that it shows what's going on in the servants' area as well as with the lords and ladies, and the plot and character development is even better.Season 3 continues this trend and doesn't let up. The issues that began in previous seasons are continued (some finalized), and new, interesting issues arise. The acting, character development, and plot development continue to be top-notch. I'm looking forward to finishing this season and waiting on the next.A note about the TV Pass: I think it's worth it if you're a huge fan of the series, and could be considered a discount from having to purchase an entire season later, but it's not an incredible deal. A little bit of a deal, but not spectacular.	5.0	Great Series Continues to Shine	2013-02-06	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AVLDW7C3DXH1Y	Neal Wilsey	I loved the first two seasons and looked forward to the third season.  I was not disappointed.  The action is fast moving with all of the twists and turns I have come to expect.  The season ends with a cliff hanger!  So, I know I will download Season 4 as soon as it becomes available.  I gave the product a rating of 5 stars because the writing is great, the acting is superb, and the video quality is excellent.  If you have already viewed the first two seasons, you probably have already downloaded season 3.  If you have not, I recommend that you start with seasons 1 and 2.I have been watching the action on my Kindle Fire.  Although the resolution on the Fire is not as high as on the Kindle Fire HD, it still looks great!	5.0	The tradition of excellence continues.	2013-02-14	1	1	0

Sad to me...why couldn't the poor fellow lived awhile since his life finally came together.  I suppose that often happens in the real world, but come on...we should have had this one!

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AD2AVD6EAZQDX	Nelson	Following what was an excellent season 1, which I am sure was a pleasant surprise for many, I was hooked and the series has become one of Public Television's biggest hits ever.  It has so many stars and each fits his or her role perfectly.  The story line is captivating and there are no dull moments as scene move quickly from place and character to others rapidly.  The music is such a great part of the supporting cast.  The series has performances that are at the top of the list and it is represented yearly at the Emmy's.  Millions around the world have been seduced by the straight-laced but stylish world of the British historical drama.  The main characters Hugh Bonneville, Maggie Smith, Michelle Dockery, and Elizabeth Montgomery could win Best in their categories each year.  I found the story line to be such as to force me to watch one episode after another and before I knew it I had watched the first three seasons completely.  It was as if I had been drawn into the surrounding, but in my case I was privy to everyone's secrets and behaviors.  I can hardly wait for Season 4 to arrive in January 2014.	5.0	British Historical Drama	2013-09-29	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A10Z1W5DZZOKHP	"N. Klipowicz ""simplify my life!"""	By far, this series, up until the near the end of Season Three, has been the most intelligent, engrossing, and well written I have taken the time to watch in years.  I found myself engrossed in the depth of the characters; enamored with acting, costumes, scenery, and brilliant twists in all subplots.  I would have been beyond impatient waiting for Season Four had the ending of Season Three not been so horrid.  The development of Matthew's character was one of the main reasons I so looked forward to future episodes; I couldn't wait to see how he would save Downton and even possibly bring to it an even more exciting future.  But now, I have no desire to watch next season.  The plans I had to purchase all three seasons on DVD for my parents as a Christmas gift are now by the wayside because it is just too dreadful to watch.  So sad to see a beautiful series disintegrate.  The only way I will reconsider is if by some remarkable twist, Matthew survived the crash.  I'll wait to hear from friends who choose to watch in January ... but as mentioned, they've lost my business for now.	3.0	Utterly adored Downton Abbey until...	2013-10-24	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9	"NyiNya ""NyiNya"""	"Warning: A minefield of Spoilers!Downton Abbey is addictive, especially if you opt for the Britisn version, not the somewhat dumbed down version edited for American tastes. The saga of an aristocratic British family in the years just before and after the first World War, it's a gorgeous look at the fashions, morals, social distinctions and events of the era. Sometimes it's a little overwrought, but when you're watching, you get so caught up, it's all good.  Season one introduced us to The Earl of Grantham, his wife and mother, his three daughters, the various servants, and Matthew Crawley, the new heir to the estate. Season two revealed the on again off again love affair between Matthew and Daughter Mary. Season 3 was even better and kept us enthralled with what those Crawleys were up to now. We were happy in our little fool's paradise...until that last episode.Matthew Crawley is like one of those Good News/Bad News jokes.  Downton Abbey is entailed. That means it can only be inherited by the closest living male relative to the current owner.  That's good news for Matthew...turns out, he's the only living heir.  The bad news? The family thinks he's a dork.  The good news, they have a beautiful daughter named Mary. Matthew likes her. A lot. Bad news? She thinks he's a major dork.  Good News: She suddenly has a change of heart. Bad news? Because if she marries Matthew, the state passes to her son and stays in the family. Good News, she changes her mind Bad news: It's too late, Matthew has met someone else even though he still loves Mary.It goes on and on and on this way. WWI intervenes and poor Matthew is MIA and then found. Twice. He's killed in action at least once, but VOILA! it's a mistake. He's fine. Ooops, no, he's seriously wounded. But he recovers. One problem gets settled and another appears.  The estate is bankrupt and then a timely inheritance makes it solvent again. Finally, in Season 3, all the problems seem to be sorting themselves out and despite one heart-breaking family tragedy, we are smiling through our tears. Watching that final Season 3 episode, we are lulled into a false sense of security...and that's when the writers stick a shiv into our hearts.Not fair. Not nice and not fair. I would be devastated, but I have one desperate hope left.  Matthew has been put through the wringer for all 3 seasons and he just keeps coming back, so i have my fingers crossed that this is going to be fixed in Season 4.  Even if the writers have to come up with a ""Dallas"" like dream ending. I don't care I just want them to fix it."	5.0	Why Why Why?	2013-04-11	1	1	0

Nothing more than a tiresome collection of shopworn plot devices and cliches. I guess some hack figured that if they could package it as a stuffy period drama they could sell it even though it's just more of the same, but with lush locations and actors with proper British accents, all of a sudden it becomes highbrow. Sure. That and $5 will get you an overpriced cup of coffee that you can enjoy while you feel as though you are broadening your horizons. Why not just watch a proper soap opera and be done with it? At least those don't try to pretend to be something they aren't. Much of the cast is superb, though.

PBS is doing their viewers a distinct disservice by only selling the UK version on disc and not warning purchasers that it does not contain all the scenes that it is showing on television. The differences appear to be brief and minor, but they are still important and they cast various characters and situations in a new light.It is unclear if PBS will ever release the US version of the show on disc but they should be providing accurate information to purchasers on just what it is we're paying for. I have read that there is allegedly a Christmas special in season 3, but if so it is not included in this set and PBS has not indicated whether it will be broadcast.As a devoted fan, I want to know that I can get ALL of ""DA"" on DVD. Come on, PBS--come clean!

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A23KKELCZBY73U	Old Sole	Downton Abbey is a very beautifully filmed and acted English drama series.  We missed watching the series when it played on television so we decided to watch it online.  We started with Season 1 and were immediately hooked.  My husband and I equally enjoyed it - couldn't get enough of it!  We watched every evening we could (as many episodes per evening as we had time for) until we completed all three seasons.  Highly recommended.	5.0	Another exceptional PBS series	2013-09-03	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2B2IJ5S4103JD	Olempia Castillo	After watching three seasons of the show a few weak point have come to my attention: 1) Character development: There is hardly any character development in anyone other than O' Brien who become a nicer character, and Daisy who has changed due to her relationship with William. The rest of the characters are essentially acting the same person in the same role as season 1, producing reactionary character where the only thing that changes are the challenges they faced with. I mean it. They utilize the same facial expressions, same body language, their clothes change though, but everything else is the same. It's been a decade already in the show for crying out loud! Not only that but the closed mindedness of the Grantham house hold is astonishing and I have started to foster a dislike of Lord Grantham and Mary in particular due to their inability to face their privilege of allow themselves to be challenged in order to grow.	3.0	Beautiful Classism	2014-01-16	0	0	0

The actors and actresses give incredibly believable performances of those who would have lived during this period of time.  Especially enjoyable and informative has been the relationship between the aristocracy and their servants.  I am continually in awe of my new insights into this historical period and the fascination of how drastically society has changed.  The Abbey with its furnishings, the clothing and jewelry...are amazing and transport one into this fascinating period of history.  I'm so addicted to these characters and their story, I can't wait to purchase the 4th season (although I wish I had the self-restraint to watch it weekly.)	5.0	Outstanding and Addictive!	2013-10-08	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AYEJND80C5DDQ	Patricia A. Leonard	Once again, the British have written and produced the best television drama series in its history.  Wonderful period piece filmed in an most amazing castle/mansion in England.  Lush scenery, gorgeous period decor, and authentic dress worn during the years right after the turn of the twentieth century (1916 and forward).  One of the first dramas to follow not only the lives and times of the ruling family, but also the little known lives of the servants.  Fascinating look at the leisurely lifestyle of the wealthy in stark contrast to the long and laborious hours spent by the servants to ensure the impeccable cleanliness and smooth running of the household.  A cultural look at the now almost gone royalty way of life in England.  Be sure to tune in as you won't regret following this interesting series.	5.0	Greatest Drama from the Briish	2013-08-31	0	0	0

I randomly selected Downton Abbey to watch.  Once I'd watched only a few minutes, I was drawn into the story and have become addicted to it!  The characters slowly but beautifully unfold, the acting is superb, the film quality top of the line, the costumes and sounds and scenery amazingly authentic and lush.  I've finished the first season, and have begun the second.  I've laughed and cried right along with the characters and can say, without reservation, this is as close to reading a great novel as it can get and a very pleasurable and most welcome escape! The series' five star rating is well deserved!	5.0	Oh my Gosh!  I totally LOVE this series!	2013-08-25	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ACWCPKCEUQUS0	"Patrick B. Lynch ""MovieFan"""	Strong characters and compelling story-lines give an inside look into the early 20th century version of the 1% in the UK, the royals, and the complex group of supporting staff and surrounding villages directly impacted by them.  Acting is superb.  I find it interesting to get a sense of the problems and challenges that faced the upper-upper class during this time in history (as the world left behind WWI and entered the roaring twenties).  I recommend watching all episodes in order as the storylines and character development stretch over many episodes at a time.  Spoiler alert!  I was frustrated at how long Bates was incarcerated, and the final episode surprise is a gut-wrencher!	5.0	Compelling, high-quality show	2014-02-06	0	0	0

So I lent her mine.  She says this series is great.  I believe it....she's glued to my Kindle everytime I see her anymore.  But, it gives me great pleasure to see her happy.  By the way, I had seen some shows on Downton Abbey and I thoroughly enjoyed them.  As for the series on Kindle...they're coming in great.  It gives Nancy time for rest from her workday.

Characters recycle in and out of the story line to keep you guessing.  Interesting to see the dichotomy with good characters doing bad things and bad characters doing good things, showing their heart.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A777WB0RKMP6U	Paul	What's not to love about Downton Abbey?  Intelligent. Witty. Spectacular. Engaging. And more and more superlatives!  This series, from start to the end of season 3, has been an emotional roller-coaster ride with no foul language, excessive sex or violence.  The interplay of the characters is realistic historically while easily addressing modern family and culture-clash issues. It's a soap, all right.  It's just really, really smart soap.  The dialogue is always interesting, well written and never sappy.  The issues the characters face are issues we face today.  The juxtaposition of modern issues played out in an historical background make the show so interesting, engaging and addicting!  My advice: Do not start watching this series if you don't have a lot of time for television!  Once you start, you will not want to quit until you've seen every episode. Twice! The costumes, landscape, art and every other aspect of the production are to the highest standards.  Beautiful to watch. Elegant to hear. Irresistibly entertaining.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A21JFJN57XM1KO	PaulR	My 3 stars is a blend of a 5 up to the last few minutes of the last episode and a 1 for the over-wrought tragedy depicted for the season finale.  I have heard that the reason was due to the reluctance of the actor to return for a 4th season.  It converted what I had been enjoying as a very good, period-revealing drama into an overblown soap opera.  Amazon may have wasted some money gaining the exclusive on this for future seasons, because I may not tune in for season 4.	3.0	Gratuitous Tragedy	2013-03-04	5	5	0

It totally shows the differences in classes during this time.  Of course I DON'T like some characters like Thomas and O'Brien.  Lady Mary and Lady Edith are pretty awful at first.  The Dowager is so intolerant, but this is also realistic.  I also shows the horrors of World War I and dangers of childbirth.

The class warfare of the times is very interesting to me.  I hated the team of &#34;O'Brien and Thomas&#34; but I truly love pitting them against each other.They are dealing with social situations that sometimes seem out of place for the time in which they are supposed to be living. But, maybe that is part of what makes it so enjoyable.Because of the show, I read the history of Highclere Castle and delved into 1920's history.  I love it when a quality show makes me interested in history enough to research and talk about how it was.  Thank you BBC for this excellent program.	5.0	A little historical fun	2013-02-08	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3M3LUTQUUHOG8	"petronmb ""Peter"""	After becoming hooked with Seasons 1 and 2, Season 3 left me saturated and &#34;over it.&#34; Particularly disturbing to me are the deaths of Sybil and Matthew, both seemingly gratuitous (although actors will leave the show, I presume, so must be written out), but more seriously these were horribly portrayed, particularly Sybil's. I felt nauseous in watching it. Then Matthew's demise at the end seemed another sensationalistic cheap shot to me, especially the way he was shown in the moment of death. These portrayals may indicate the writer is getting carried away, or maybe such a series is meant to end earlier.

I was persuaded to pick it up again with Season 3 and I have been transfixed by the quality of the writing and the exploration of many themes that came into play as the C20th century progressed.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3CCNH7OCYIGYQ	"P. J.

This tarnished the series a little for me.  We shall see what awaits us in Season 5.  But nevertheless, a jolly good show!	5.0	Wonderful Series - Great Casting and Actors!	2014-03-05	0	0	0

Maggie Smith is always worth the price of admission. But the number of characters killed off has left a rather tawdry and implausibly Gothic palette with which to carry the series forward. Too bad the producers could not have locked in option extensions for actors to allow for reasonable and coherent exits and entrances.

This series is entertaining, full of surprises and emotionally touching.  Beginning with life in rural England in 1912 on a large estate with a staff that plays an integral part in family life, it is easy to imagine that this is a reality show of long ago. The luxury and lifestyle offer an escape from the world of today and yet provides a glimpse of where some of our traditions originated.

Season 3 was a real heart stopper and at times a heart breaker.  I will not say more. I don't want to ruin it if you haven't seen it.  If you have not watched it then you have missed some real talent in acting and writing. Watch season one and two first to get to understand the dynamics of the house.

I believe part of the appeal of this series is the humaness of the Crawleys - yes, they are 'the elite' yet, they are caring people of those they love and those that serve them.  Mistakes are made; forgiveness, given.  No matter if it's your worst enemy or your own sister.	5.0	Back on Track	2014-04-07	0	0	0

The show is well written and full of surprises as one could expect in any life.  What makes this series special is the attention to detail in the day to day life of the English aristocracy and the real life prejudices against Catholics (some of which still exist in England today with their anti-Catholic laws), the poor and the Irish.  I look forward in seeing more of the series and hope it will be around for several more seasons.	5.0	Fascinating Lesson in English Privileged Class History	2013-01-24	1	1	0

If you aren't able to get into the story, you can sit back and enjoy the beautiful setting of the piece. The beautiful filming is quite enjoyable. Downton Abbey is a beautiful setting for any story.  It is a glorious story all in itself.  The countryside is amazing.The story lines are quite interesting studies of human nature.  The tales include lust, greed, control, and other basic human transactions.  The characters have a great amount of depth.  You get to see the good and bad in all of the characters in the story.Lastly, it is an amazing fictional tale with great historical references.  I have modify some of my views of this time period.  The placement of characters with in the caste system that was in place during the 1900's is eye opening.This series is one that I enjoy binging.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A35FZ79LQU094S	Rachelle	I'm way behind on the whole Downton craze, but when I picked up on it I binged on the first two seasons - finishing both in just a week. Season 3 gets intense, and while I didn't like it as much as season 2, it's still wonderfully written with engaging characters and complex plot lines. The only reason I knocked a star off is for a choice that was made by one person (I won't spoil it for anyone!) that completely disrupted the storyline. (You'll know when you get there folks, and if you Google WHY it had to happen that way, prepare to be frustrated).	4.0	LOVE Downton	2014-02-27	0	0	0

Back in November, I purchased the UK version through Amazon UK to watch on my region free DVD player. I was very happy with it, but I was still looking forward to receiving my blu-ray version and watching it in high def.When I watched it on PBS, I was stunned to see (edited: a good 8-10 additional scenes that were not shown in the UK version), and the whole series hasn't even been shown yet. I never dreamed that the Blu-Ray released would not be the full version but I went to watch it tonight and lo and behold, it's the version with the missing scenes. I am returning my disks ASAP and hoping they release the full version soon.	1.0	Not the version seen on PBS. Shorts a number  of scenes	2013-01-30	3	2	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2K7JWATROGEV3	Rach'sRamblings	To me this season didn't have as much to offer as the previous one. A couple of the story lines I didn't like either. I think at this point the only character I like is Anna. Not as much history, too much societal political stuff. The loss of two main characters doesn't make me excited for season four. I also agree that the changing of moral character of someone without anything bringing about that change...something just didn't follow in that story line at all. Won't go any further as I don't want to give away too much to those who have not seen it. Not near as excited about any future ones.... They ran out of story lines.	2.0	Thought it was lacking..	2013-07-22	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1CV8BB4ET6KVR	Rae Shar	After the first two seasons my expectations were at the highest level. With the events unfolding as they did in this set I have had to re think my evaluation of the series as a whole. After doing just that I still come to realize that this third DVD is still perfect.  As with life there is always unexpected  occurrences that don't seem to fit into your own scheme of things yet we will always, hopefully, go on with acceptances and proceed along the journey. Downton Abbey Season 3 has enough continuance of what you come to expect from this production that it brings you enjoyment and anticipation every single episode. My total satisfaction with each character has me euphoric: the perfect timing of Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess, the complicated but deeply understandable rogue image of Thomas, the loveable Anna one of my favorites, and the many other perfectly human characters give me much to enjoy. I could enumerate the complete cast and each actor as absolutely wonderful. Not one was a poor performer; not one was unbelievable. The complete ensemble provided perfect movement to the storyline with no dull moments nor lulls. I must tell you I have watched the full three series more than once and am already set to enjoy them again now while waiting for the fourth much anticipated installment.	5.0	CONTINUING MASTER PIECE OF PROGRAMMING	2013-08-31	0	0	0

I recommend this entire series if you enjoy the early 1900s era. Each of the actors plays their role excellently, i commend them all!

This DVD releasing in January here in the U.S., is the original un-edited UK edition, but being released by PBS (and not Universal Pictures UK), this IS the U.S. Region 1 version, playable in all U.S. players.  It is being released in January in the U.S., the same month that it will be airing on PBS here in the States. It is currently airing in the UK on ITV-1, the first 3 episodes so far, and will be releasing on DVD in the UK (by Universal Pictures UK) on Nov 5th, so those of you with UK/Region 2 players may want to consider that.  For all you U.S. DVD players, this Region 1 DVD is coming Jan 29th!! The excellent cast returns for another round of drama at Downton: you'll love the new twists and turns in Season 3: You won't want to miss your chance to pick up this fanstastic Season 3, returning to Downton Abbey!!	5.0	Ah, Season 3's awesomeness will soon be here in the U.S.!	2012-10-03	45	35	10

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A152RA0SDRUOLD	RAS	I find it very unlikely in a Grand House like Downton Abbey to find so much drama regarding the aspects of some scenes involving homosexuality. Almost all of the servant class were vowed into celibacy and also would rarely include a husband and wife team. Kind of felt where this was going in season two. I'm done. Will be interesting to see if season three draws as many viewers as one and early two did. Then again I could be wrong, just my opinion as to what I wish to view.......... is that still allowed??????????? This was not meant to offend anyone, as I judge no one to their choice of life, nor discriminate against anyone. I wouldn't have liked torrid love scenes with the Crowley's either.  Just felt it took away the grandeur of looking into a era almost all but gone.	2.0	misleading historicity	2013-03-24	4	3	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2F2MH8CJ3IMS6	Rebecca Pipkin	When reading the &#34;English&#34; reviews I realized 95% of the Brits are VERY disappointed in Season 3.  We Americans are little more forgiving...thankfully!  I'm certainly not happy with the deaths of two of my favorite characters, but not enough to stop watching all together.  I'm looking forward to Season 4.  Downton Abbey is still the &#34;Best Dressed&#34;...&#34;Best Acted&#34; series I've ever had the fun of watching.The only flaw, as far as I'm concerned, is Thomas!  I have never cared for the character's choice of lifestyle, and could have done nicely without ever having to watch him &#34;in action&#34;.  I do get very tired of him always being so mean and then ending up with a &#34;promotion&#34; to a higher rank in service.  Guess &#34;PC&#34; was alive and well back in the early 1900's too.I was thrilled to be able to purchase Season 3 before it actually played out on TV.  So now there will be a long dry spell before the &#34;fun&#34; begins again!  But owning all 3 seasons on DVD, I can always have a &#34;Downton Abbey Marathon&#34; whenever I feel the need!	5.0	Still my favorite show on TV!	2013-02-08	1	1	0

Now, how many months/years before it continues?

If we wanted to watch misery...watch the news and most of the movies in the cinemas.I do believe that most folks who watch Downton...want to watch something beautiful and uplifting....of course with the usua limpediments..but do not kill off the main characters!!

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AUAVDUJ4G767O	RFJ	"Sometimes I can't believe how much I enjoy this series! I could write an entire essay on how well produced I think it is but in short I'll just say:Classy characters, with phenomenal dialogue, costumes, cinematography, and writing that compels the viewer to live and breathe every human emotion, from abject pain to pure joy, with humor, INTELLIGENCE, integrity and a little romance!Some further thoughts:For some reason I can't get enough of this program and have never enjoyed a television show so much! I guess in some way it ""feeds my head"" in the sense that for the first time in a long time I have found a fictional serial television show that actually nourishes my mind as opposed to being just ""mindless"". Honestly I haven't watched a lot of commercial TV recent years for the simple fact that for at least two decades in the US serial television has really just been in a ""race to the bottom"" in terms of content. If it isn't just plain dumb, crass, or voyeuristic (and certainly devoid of anything remotely intellectual) it doesn't get airtime at all or for very long. All we seem to get is ""trash for the masses"" in the form of dumbed down filler that somehow sells advertising space. In the case of Downton Abbey there are characters that simply tell us their story in an authentic, believable, poignant and intelligent way that is so refreshing it makes me ecstatic to watch their stories unfold with every episode. I feel as if I actually want to know them and care about them. Yes, they have flaws and problems but they also have ideals, values, integrity and last but not least... self-respect! In a way I feel like this show actually reminds me that real people can be better than they are and strive to be good and not just settle for life as the ""lowest common denominator"". Every time I watch it I feel like I've actually learned something valuable about human behavior and what it is to be truly noble regardless of your station in life. All in all it is simply a spectacular entertainment achievement! Congratulations to the cast & crew and of course Julian Fellowes for giving us this truly marvelous and meaningful diversion!"	5.0	Awesome entertainment	2013-01-25	1	1	0

Like many movies you escape into the lead of a movie and you don't want it to end. Downtown Abbey you know as the different chapters evolve as you scroll through the dvd you know it has to end maybe with a happy ending or maybe with a cliffhanger that makes you wait till next season.........and what a long wait. It's worth it, why the mini series has so many different figures from the rich to the lowly kitchen maid that works there. Each person employed in the Abbey has a story,each member of the family has a story,So with so many different people there is so much going on.Maggie Smith as the family leader always has something smart to remark to in her conversations with others. You laugh,you cry,you are surprised ,astonished, overjoyed and puzzeled as you watch season 3 &#62; Maybe the best of the three seasons,What happens in season 4  you will want to knowI sure do.	4.0	DOWNTOWN ABBEY SEASON 3  A MINI SERIES TO REMEMBER	2013-04-27	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1OKYEKK5VE8VG	Richard Steiger	"There are spoilers to follow, but the plot is so absurd and chaotic it hardly matters. The writers just do what they feel like at the moment.OK, here goes.  I've watched every single episode of the first three seasons of Downton Abbey (some of them twice), and I'm here to tell you it's basically pure junk. The plot(s) are hokey beyond imagining: one daughter runs off with the chauffer (a radical Irish socialist to boot), another loses her virginity to a Turk who dies during the encounter, a third is jilted at the alter by an old one-armed man, a lame valet goes to prison for murdering his wife, etc.  During the second season Matthew's fiancee conveniently dies and he is miraculously cured of his inability to walk so he can marry his true love.  These are just a few examples of the silliness of the show. The portrait of the British aristocracy (particularly the Duke or whatever he is) is unbelievable (only the incomparable Maggie Smith makes them endurable). After the penultimate episode of Season 3 I thought (hoped) it was over. Everything seemed resolved. Bates was back, married, in a new home; the gay valet was going to stay, the Irish chauffer and his baby were moving into the house, etc. But wait . . . there's more. Matthew is dead and a whole new set of questions (and facile ansers) remains.As I say, all this gives a rich new meaning to ""hokey."" This series isn't remotely comparable to ""Upstairs/Downstairs,"" let alone the original ""Forsyte Saga.""Still, I watched every episode and I'm sure I'll watch Season 4. So I guess one star and five stars would be equally appropriate.  I split the difference and gave it three."	3.0	"The definition of ""guilty pleasure""--addictive junk"	2013-03-19	6	4	2

The English people speak very proper, and clearly and I find this a nice change for me to listen to them speak.  I watch one or two episodes each evening for pure enjoyment. The wardrobe of clothes, set locations, scenery, etc with the trains and old autos and carriages, etc...bring back a forgotten history of memorability including a life style of royalty and wealth one is not privileged to live.  The life style is detailed to allows us to see the inner workings of the servants and royalty which produce more mystery and intrigue  -----it is just a real masterpiece theater ---and one many will find enjoyable to watch ---this is what we find when talking with other people about it. We started from the first season so we could follow each character thread --I believe was a good idea----because the characters have twists and turns not expected based upon previous history and explain connections in the story.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1EUI8FA4KNV95	Rissi	"Reviewer's Note: Though I cannot promise I won't ""slip up,"" this will be a SPOILER-FREE review.Anyone who has watched this series - which I believe is basically... everyone, knows its sorrows, joys and triumphs. It's an award-winning ITV series penned by Julian Fellowes that has evolved a great deal in the last three years. Praised for its first season but earning lackluster reviews in its second (which I attribute to the time frame), the series returns for a stronger, but emotionally driven third season. One that wouldn't be the 'Downton Abbey' we know and love without some fun and soapy drama - and there's plenty of it!It has been many months since the house of Downton Abbey has seen such life and happiness as that of the impending wedding of Mary (Michelle Dockery) and Matthew (Dan Stevens). Butler and stickler of the rules, Carson (Jim Carter) couldn't be more proud if Mary were his own daughter - always his favorite, Carson would do anything to see to it that Mary and his employer Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonnville) receive only the best care and are never subject to scandal. Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) and the family couldn't be more delighted that Mary and Matthew are finally marrying after a tumultuous relationship and for once, Cora and her mother-in-law, Countess Grantham (Maggie Smith) agree on something. The big day isn't complete without the arrival of Cora's opinionated - and bossy -American mother (Shirley McClain)... and Cora's youngest daughter, Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay) who created waves of conflict in the family when she married the chauffer, Tom (Allen Leech). Accepting a tradesman for a son-in-law soon becomes second to the dreams of Edith (Laura Carmichael) becoming a journalist, the arrival of new downstairs staff, Thomas' shenanigans, scary possibilities for Mrs. Hughes (Phyillis Logan)... and financial woes for Downton Abbey.What makes this series such a success is its characters. It's been said time and again by reviewer after reviewer. And it's true; the foundation would simply crumble without them. It's the things that we laugh, cry and bite our nails over that makes Downton so distinctively what it is. Three years in, that is still the key to why this is so darn successful and I am pleased to say that even entering an age of renowned promiscuity - the ""roaring 20's,"" Fellowes still retains the charm and (mostly) wholesome ideal. Marvels galore - from new characters and old favorites... to inventive new costuming! -will delight devoted fans of this popular British-originated and now ""imported"" American series.Leaving off from the second season, certain character's fates were left in tatters and in jeopardy, and others lives were finally getting on the track of happily-ever-after after much angst. I'll confess to reading spoilers and gossiping about this in anticipation with a couple of friends so I wasn't unprepared for anything that was happening in the stately halls of my favorite British mansion. There is plenty of soapy drama mixing in with tears... and lest you despair, never fear, there are events that make us smile and our hearts inexplicably happy. Edith's happiness takes a turn, ripping a page straight from a Bronte novel. Thomas and O'Brien continue to scheme directing hate towards each other. Lest you think some fan favorites are absent, you'd be mistaken; Daisy, Anna and Bates are still a familiar presence, as is Isobel and even the re-appearance of the fallen maid, Ethel. New faces also become a fixture at Downton between a besotted new kitchen maid and a vain footman. That alone creates loads of tension.Some of the highlights consist of meeting Cora's mother (she and Violet are a riot together - like she and Isobel, they are constantly at odds) as well as the characters who have evolved into something more mature and if possible, more wonderful. Being something of a romantic, I wish Matthew and Mary had shared more intimate moments of flirting and stolen kisses but being the proper British couple they are, that is kept to a minimum but seriously, as my mother said, ""even when they're fighting, they are cute!"" She is so right! Their interaction is darling and all too rare. Everything from the motor cars to the scenery, the grandeur of a London club to the costuming is gorgeous and beautifully puts us in mind of this era. I love the production for that reason alone if nothing else though there are many other reasons. With rumors that some of the main cast (nooo! Please say it isn't so!) is leaving and no report that there will be a fourth series (yet!), I can accept this ending but am wishing that we will be granted another series beyond just the upcoming Christmas special. So many moments were precious (including the acceptance of Tom - loved Robert's shifting attitude) and memories were made that we will no doubt cherish all of which is carried by the phenomenal cast and the emotional, witty script. Perhaps it's not as ""brilliant"" as when it first debuted though far be it from me to judge, but Fellowes is on the right track and for me, Downton Abbey won my heart over anew.'Downton Abbey' premieres in the U.S. January 2013 on Masterpiece Theatre.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2L6TI9AA2U4LK	RMWARZ	Compared to the previous two seasons, I found Season 3 of Downton Abbey a slight disappointment.  The outstanding production values and excellent performances continue, but the storyline has declined.  If we fans are honest with ourselves, we acknowledge that this series is at its core a soap opera, superbly executed, but a soap opera nonetheless.  During this season, however, the soap suds seemed to billow as the plot careened from crisis to crisis and heartbreak to heartbreak.  Still, I enjoyed this series and would recommend it to fans of well-crafted period drama.  And I'm already looking forward to Season 4.	4.0	Downton Comes Down a Peg	2013-10-10	0	0	0

As a fan of historical fiction novels, Downton Abbey really caught my interest.  I love the period costumes and the staging.  In HD, the Abbey is spectacular in it's own right.  The characters develop well and the give and take between Dame Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton is highly entertaining.

Very good characters and the story line moves along briskly (for a bunch of Brits)...  I love the old cars and my wife loves all the fine costumes (1920's).

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AV0HAWNZACHI7	rogue	I'm so happy that I watched the first season when they had it on netflix or I might have never seen it. I don't have cable and I saw it there and thought I'll give it a go for curiosities sake. So glad I did, it's one of the best shows out there currently. I'm so tired of seeing all these awful, demeaning and down right dumb reality shows. I love the era they chose, so much happens and is not a time discussed enough. And the fact they have so many characters and they are able to make them interesting and real, and keep up with it all is impressive. And such wonderful characters, that I never cried so hard in my life for a show or film as I did when Sybil died. And it takes a lot for me to do so. I had to watch the whole thing with a box of tissues. In fact I was so distressed that they killed one of my favorite characters that I wasn't sure if I could continue watching. But couldn't stay away, I had to continue it's that good. And unfortunately it looks like I'm in for a lot more tears but I'm hooked. I'm ready for the 4th season and was aggravated that I have to wait til January for the DVD. Oh well, I've got my husband intrigued now I think so we may watch the first season together. I warned him to be patient because the first few episodes are slow to start but it's building the world, and the many characters and introducing you to the life they are coming from. Then....wham...it gets awesome.	5.0	Wonderful Show with Excellent story and Characthers	2013-10-05	0	0	0

The entire series is beautifully done.  The visuals are spectacular from the small details of the kitchen to the expanses of life in the Abbey and down.  The characters are real and honest.  Season 3 brings joy and sadness in equal measure.  I have watched all of these seasons on my Kindle Fire HDX.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A384UDUG6DFVZZ	"Rollo ""Cinnaman"""	This series is 1. entertaining and 2. provides an interesting look at an historical period with apparent accuracy.  As an American, though, what do I know about the accuracy?  In any case, it is interesting.  I rate it slightly below 5 stars only because you get the feeling that you are being more than slightly manipulated as new dramas (problems) are inevitably created with each episode.  Of course that is the necessary ingredient to keep interest levels high, but perhaps the dramatic turns are just a little too obvious at times.  The 3rd season ends dramatically of course, to make sure that you'll be there for Season 4.	4.0	A Nice Look at a Bygone Era	2014-05-12	0	0	0

The episode that included the birth of a baby and subsequent death of Sybil was emotional, and I found myself crying over the bittersweet moment of a beginning of a life and also the end of another.  My one little dislike of the show is the focus on Mr. Bates.  It is just a tad unbelieveable (in writing terms) that one person could be accused of so many false charges and go through as much as he does.  Also, he never gets upset???  I would be one raging howling lunatic to be the so-called innocent in a series of accusations.  Maybe the writers have him calm and passive because he really is guilty and is fooling everyone.	4.0	Downton Abbey	2013-02-01	3	2	1

The only faults I would list are that sometimes the scene shifts are too abrupt, which takes away from thorough character development, and the writing which sometimes seems strained or forced.  That is, compared to the first two seasons, for which the story lines seemed richer.  All in all, however, this show is better to watch than about 95% of all broadcast, satellite, or streamed media.	4.0	Much better than most	2013-08-11	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A27ZEFH5L14CJC	Rudy Fan	I just finished the season. I have loved this series up until the last couple of episodes. **Warning - Spoilers ahead** To begin with, I do NOT like the character of Rose. She has no depth and is very stereotypical of teenagers today! And she's coming to Downton to replace Sybil I guess. Just dumb. And then there's poor Lady Edith or should we now call her Jane Eyre? Her man is horribly chained to a lunatic wife he cannot divorce; why steal a plot line that was already done and done better to boot? And now we are manipulated into feeling sorry for Thomas when most of the series, he was always plotting and evil, not being heroic and humble.To top it all off, one of my 'favorite to look at' characters gets killed off. I find, after reading a few of these reviews, that he wanted to leave the show. Too bad, but geez, aren't actors signed onto long term series with long term contracts? I also hated when Sybil died, but this was just too much. I guess when there is happiness, it's just gotta be ripped away. And really, enough of Anna and Mr. Bates. They just bug me SO much. If you ask me, he's pretty creepy, especially when he was in prison. I think we saw the real side of him in there.So, I'm done with this show.

It begins with news of the Titanic and the beginning of the 1900's.  I was spellbound; completely taken in with the time period, awed by the fashions, the details of the mansion, the language, the way the servants lived in conjunction with the wealthy upstairs family.  Downton Abbey, the mansion, is itself a character.  I want to look in its many rooms, and am often given the chance to do just that.  Any questions you have about the mores of the time are answered throughout this series by the innumerable problems that the characters encounter.  The pacing is swift and, like a great classic book that is hard to put down, I dreaded reaching the end of this Episode, feeling as if I'd be leaving new but dear friends behind.	5.0	Downton Abbey-must see entertainment	2013-08-31	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AITMM279VY5PM	saavy	Episode 1 begins the season up to the minute of Mary's wedding to Matthew.  I was enthralled with the way they presented her coming to the church in a horse drawn carriage and the Valets, and all the excitement of the community people gathering around although it was an actual royal wedding taking place.  Mary's dress is quite &#34;matronly&#34; but very lovely, and she looked beautiful.  Matthew saves the day when he asks Branson to be his Best Man at the last minute, ignoring any repercussions there may be with the Grantham family.  Branson in the end turned out to be a faithful friend when Matthew was at a crossroads in a major life decision that would affect his and Mary's future together and the future of Downton Abbey itself.  He finally was able to show himself worthy to the Grantham family and especially to Lord Grantham himself.	5.0	Best Episode Yet	2014-04-10	0	0	0

These were:What I didn't like:  (1) I ordered the U.K edition.  However, some discs were the U.S. edition which had several commercials at the beginning and end,  and (2) None of the labels on the discs specified the specific episode #'s on each respective disc.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A25BKO4OYLGMSJ	SAM	Not worth the time and effort to find anything truly critical of it.  Sometimes I don't think I am in the mood for it but al ways always happy to have seen it. Witty, dramatic, snappy dialogue and even some villains who have few redeeming qualities. I admire the women for being able to be discreet rather than critical of their men, probably a much more effective  method of getting ones way. I  wish I had a helper like the sweet little girl in the kitchen. I have had very nice maids but none so truly involved.  I suppose that could become rather burdensome and if they actually paid as much attention to their household staff as portrayed, I would be quite surprise. I want to see Cold Comfort Farm for some contrast now.	5.0	I think I could enjoy it indefinately	2013-08-13	0	0	0

However, this does not mean their lives are without trials and tribulations, joys and devastation. Personal problems overwhelm the characters. Triumphs bring them joy and satisfaction. However, the post-war world is starting to change, and the aristocratic lifestyle of Downton Abbey is starting to show signs of crumbling.As in the other seasons of this epic drama, the characters are well defined and realistic, the photography exquisite and full of expression, and the costuming breath taking. Gifted actors speaking well-written, sometimes ironic dialogue make this another season to watch ravenously.	5.0	Downton Abbey: Season 3: Another Success!	2013-08-21	1	1	0

I don't like sitting still, but oh my GOSH my friends wouldn't shut up about Downton Abbey. These weren't the same set of friends who watch things like the Bachelor or Honey whoever the hell that is, so I was curious. I rented one show, then another and the next thing you know, I've watched a whole season! The series is more literary than most things on television today. I won't go so far as to say it's intellectually stimulating because after all, we're talking about the lives of the English nobility and their servants. It's more of a historical fiction though and I find the costumes and the characters to be delightful and sometimes downright nasty. No doubt some might say that it's just a snobby soap opera, but we prefer to call it drama, dear.	5.0	Don't Like TV, Love Downton	2013-08-13	0	0	0

Let Downton Abbey continue for many seasons!  Some thoughts on the characters from the vantage point of the beginning of season 3...I liked Mary and Matthew far more before they got married.  Now they seem shallower--she harder, he less intelligent.  That is disappointing; I hope their characters will become more mature and refined as their story unfolds.  For me now, the central love story belongs to stalwart  Anna and noble John Bates.  But how did such a man ever get entangled with a woman like Vera?! Shirley MacLaine is simply not believable as Cora's mother.  She great fun to watch, though!  Cora doesn't seem to retain a shred of the Jewishness of her mother.  She also does not seem believable as the wife of Lord Robert Grantham.  She seems too smarmy to be loved by him.  He is a solid, good man whose depth and dignity emerges again and again, even when he learns he has lost all Cora's money.	5.0	Getting to Know Them...	2013-10-20	1	1	0

The acting, writing, directing, story lines - all excellent.  Be sure to have a tissue box available for this season and you will, indeed, need it.  Sorry that we are almost caught up to the current shows, as it means I won't be able to watch every night.Only problems we had with it was that there were annoying streaming issues, that shut the show down too frequently, and it doesn't stream more than a minute ahead.  It worked better when we watched at off peak times.  I think it much have something to do with the number of people trying to watch episodes or the busyness off the Internet.Anyway, that aside, I love, love, love Downton Abbey.	5.0	Television at its best!	2014-02-05	0	0	0

We are Downton addicts! The historical context (sinking of the Titanic, WWI,  and now the run up to WWII) is deftly woven into the storyline., as are the changing roles of women in society. It is fascinating to see the class system within the class sytem, as downstairs at Downton,  some of the staff believe they're beneath certain duties.Beyond the interesting historical value, the characters are captivating, charming,  and the show is a delight to watch!	5.0	Delightful & Engaging Drama from Across the Pond!	2014-03-08	0	0	0

I really liked the first 2 seasons but the 3rd season abruptly ended my enjoyment of this series. In all fairness there was quite a bit of drama in all 3 but this last one was just too much for me to enjoy and it came right at the end. I loved most of the characters but I was just enthralled with Mary and Mathew. Their relationship finally took off and was settling in with the baby and then he was abruptly killed off. I don't think I will be compelled to watch the 4th season anytime soon to see how that played out.	3.0	shocked	2014-03-09	1	1	0

The writing continues to delight, and the clashes between Shirley MacLaine and Dame Maggie Smith had most of the people I know riveted to their seats expecting blood.  The exposure of attitudes and mores of the period, while we virtuously exclaim of it as shocking, occasionally points a somber light on some of our dilemmas a century later.

I was so happy I could watch Seasons 1 & 2 with Amazon Prime and get caught up quickly and be ready for Season 3 to begin.  Now that I'm leaving the U.S. again, I'm praying I can connect to my sling box so I can keep up with this wonderful series.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2Q34SL5DCTTGE	S d cc Dr rd as f2f discredited4	I was a &#34;New&#34; watcher to BBC this year. My son encouraged me to watch Downton Abby, and about 3 weeks ago I started watching season 1 through my Amazon Prime membership. I was hooked after one show and proceeded to watch all 4 seasons, watching a show every chance I had in place of regular TV and reading. What to say, the costumes, the vintage cars, and then the people. The acting is wonderful, some characters are quirky, some are mean and cruel and vile and Maggie Smith often steals the scenes she is in with her dry wit and elegant sarcasm.I just purchased season 1 for my mom, and can hardly wait to start talking to her about it. Sit back, enjoy and prepare to be transported to a time when words, spoken and written were the tour de force.	5.0	Love it!	2014-03-25	0	0	0

I like drama, but this season went over the top. One can only take so much & this season did me in going ridiculously outside the bounds of believability.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AIQ0PEH0MJSYX	Sharon	My criticisms are only about the story line & Shirley MacLaine's character.  Regarding the story line:  There were many other characters that could have &#34;passed on&#34; without doing away with a favorite.  It seems that bringing in new characters is what the writer seems to focus on.  Personally, I could care less about most of the new characters & miss my favorite.As an American, I do take offense with the rude, common, flashy nouveau riche, vulgarity person that the writer seems to want classified as how those fortunate in times of need behaved in the USA.  All of the wealthy non-American characters have an elegance about them.  Even Tom after he has become used to being included.  Shirley MacLaine is a fantastic actor.  To have her &#34;over act&#34; and portray Cara's mother as the writer/director has done is an insult.	5.0	"There were many other characters that could have ""passed on"" without doing away with a favorite.

The writing is exceptional.  The acting is flawless.  This season is every bit as good as the first two.  If you love period pieces as much as I do, this is a &#34;must see.&#34;  Though I loved all of the performances, I must give special kudos to Maggie Smith, whose snobbishness, laced with a bit of humor, is so entertaining.  Still, her portrayal does not rise to the level of caricature, but is a fully developed, well-rounded and believable character.. But in all fairness, all of the performances are marvelous. The one thing I did not like was the traumatic ending in the season finale.  What happened at the end was very disappointing.  Still, it did not in anyway detract from the quality of the show.  It was just a bit more realism than I wanted.  I highly recommend Downton Abbey. ,	5.0	Marvelous show!	2013-08-20	0	0	0

I was rather surprised that there were some scenes cut in the last three episodes, compared to viewing them on TV. Also, part of the dvd was including the making of Downton Abbey which I was really looking forward to see. Instead of the making of season three, only the making of season one and season two were included in the ""special features"".Everything else is fine. If you don't mind scenes that are cut out, compared to seeing them on TV, then enjoy the movie."	3.0	Little Disappointed	2013-02-04	1	1	0

But since I miss some episodes, I usually purchase the DVD's from Amazon.  So far they have been very satisfactory.  I give the series five stars because it is entertaining to me in all regards - I love seeing the customs, fashions, home furnishings, history, etc. of that era.  The actors are excellent and stories they tell are fascinating - always some drama going on with the house staff and family.  I know that this will categorize me as &#34;old-fashioned,&#34; but I also like that there is good acting and wonderful dialogue that doesn't involve so much vulgarity but yet has all the elements of human nature.

However I am upset about the amount of people that are being killed off. William,Lavinia,Syble and now Mathew to say nothingof poor Pamouk and Vera as well as Cora losing her baby..So I am wondering how many and who will be next in season 4 if there is one.I had wondered how they were going to get Bates outof prison.Never thought it would be as simple as a pie.A pie would never get one off in this country but it is fantasy to begin with.However a lot ofresearch must have gone on about that time of life. Being of Irish decent myself I could sympathise with Tom especialy my ancesters are from northernIreland which is still under British rule.However it was done it is an excellant piece of work and the person that said the U.S. should take a lesson fromthe Brits in making movies that needs no sex or violence was so right.Amazon has done an excellant job in getting Downton Abbey to the public in a timely manner.I have no complaints about their product.I love my Kindle Fire.	5.0	TLGABE	2013-02-05	3	2	1

I grew to feel like I knew each character, as each individual was brought to life in every episode, and I found it hard to wait to see what was going to happen next.

The Season Finale (Journey to the Highlands) was sloppily put together, and apart from its &#34;shocking&#34; ending, quite boring. I understand that Rose and her family are introduced as characters that mainly serve a &#34;social issues&#34; function and as a comparison to Downton. That being said, they are very abruptly introduced, and I was left feeling a little confused.  By the end of this season it really felt like the writers were out to sea; struggling to figure out where their characters are going.	4.0	Love Downton, but Season Finale to Season 3 is a big (boring) mess	2013-02-06	1	1	0

Well, Downton Abbeyis even better! Covering the tumultuous years between 1906 and 1920,the 3 seasons introduce you to the wonderful country estate and the lives of Lord Grantham, his wife Cora, and his 3 daughters as well as a lively  and conniving bunch of domestics.  World War 1 serves as a distinct character, and Maggie Smith, as the Lord's Mum (Dowager Dutchess) adds the right touch of elegant irony, sarcasm, and love.  Dring the last season, Shirley MacLaine makes our cup  runneth over with her incisive portrayal of Cora's rich American Mom, with homes in NewYork and Newport.

I'm guessing her philosophy has transitioned to&#34;  better to hold the tongue (depriving others of some wonderfully sarcastic wit) than erring on the side of American vulgarity. Mary's sweet countenance is beginning to wear a little thin- hope to see a little more develop from her.	4.0	Third Season Begins	2013-01-11	1	1	0

I love the well developed characters, the historical setting that puts it all into context, and the interesting plot lines.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A5FHWJFD7MMHR	Sophia	With nothing really good on TV currently to watch, I was looking for a new series to start watching. I had heard good things about Downtown Abbey, so decided to go with that. The very first episode of season 1 started off a bit slow..but I stuck with it, remembering how Breaking Bad also started slow and turned out to be a phenomenal series. I have found that to be true for Downton Abbey as well. I got so drawn in by the characters and story lines...I would literally come home from work and watch another episode(sometimes2) most every night! I'm now on season 4 (the current season on TV) season 4 is not free with your Amazon Prime membership, you have to pay per episode, so fortunately I'm able to watch it On Demand through my cable service at no cost. This show just gets better and I don't want to see it end! It's definitely in my list of top fave shows!	5.0	Such an addictive show!	2014-03-22	0	0	0
1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A10J5JDU4KVU1O	Sophia	I love this show, it is very gripping.  I get so involved that i seem to think about it for days.  I gave it only 4 stars because I am still upset that a certain person dies at the end of the last episode.  I cannot believe that they killed him off, he is a very important character and I just could not believe that the writers did that.  I will still watch the next season because I love the storyline.

But let me tell you, theres never a dull moment and there's always something happening. Sometimes I can't believe each episode is only 45-50 mins long because so much happens each episode. It's well made and if you love the style of the roaring 20's, you will love it. Their outfits are so nice, wish that style would come back!	5.0	Never a dull moment! Love it!	2014-01-22	0	0	0

I am very interested in who Mary will choose and who Edith is going to end up with and also if the family finds out about her child.  Then there is Tom Bransen, I so want him to find another love. Then there is Bates and Anna, what will happen with their relationship?  Will Mr. Barrow finally meet his demise?  The Costumes, Actors and Locations are all fantastic.

Having heard such rave reviews from friends and being a sucker for a period drama, I endeavored to check out Downton Abbey about a year ago.  I watched the pilot episode from Season 1 on Netflix and found it was &#34;just alright&#34; for me.Then, a few months ago, I was cruising Prime Instant offerings and decided to give it another go - episode 2 really started drawing me in and by episode 3 I was scheduling a Downton Abbey fest to get caught up to current.This show has great acting, interesting storylines (especially the back of the house intrigue) and fantastic production values.  I highly recommend you go back and start with season 1 and work your way through or you'll lose too much of the plot.	5.0	Great Quality Television - Give it 3 episodes and you'll be hooked	2014-02-03	0	0	0

It's a character study of many different people all at the same time---like life is.  The characters are multi-dimensional unlike most of the silly predictable rot that is mass manufactured for today's audiences.  There have been a couple silly things--like &#34;Patrick&#34; coming back from the dead then disappearing again,  and  the convenient death of Matthew's intended, but for the most part the story is gripping.	5.0	consistently excellent	2013-03-20	1	1	0

Well, they did, and it kind of worked. The series continues to tug at heartstrings, with the death of the renegade daughter in childbirth leaving the renegade revolutionary Irish guy to fend for the newborn; the expected return of the jailed wronged faithful valet; the expected muted outrage of the ruling masters & mistresses of the realm as the world keeps changing around them... These are all the makings of a well-executed soap opera that makes us love the ruling class of 1920s Britain while wondering what might be wrong with our own ruling masters.	4.0	Yeah... predictable even if you didn't know	2013-03-09	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ASAGHIY4QPHPI	Stephen C. Smith	Still the best television production since the golden age of TV.  Though created as a mini-series made specifically for television, its story substance, great acting, and beautiful production values makes the current output of Hollywood appear to have been made by a group of juvenile amateurs.  If you are looking for entertainment made for grown-ups that ranks with the best, watch Downton Abbey.	5.0	Season 3 Continues An Outstanding Tradition	2014-03-31	0	0	0

The thing about Downton Abbey is that so many blockbuster things happen that you just don't see coming.

I only wish they'd continue producing more of it, and I wish the old man writer who dreams these things up from his bathtub would ask me for advice on another story line episode......nevertheless....Continue Downton at all costs.....the American people will surely keep supporting it with their DVD Sales.

The characters grow with each show, taking you on a ride through the ups and downs of early 20th century English society from both the upstairs and downstairs perspective.  Takes me about two hours after every show to lose my British accent.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1PQF3P8XS4PPB	Steven M. Wise	We've been captivated by the cast of characters and the curious life-styles of the Lords and Ladies, as well as their servants. It's interesting to watch how the two classes interact with one another. As far as I understand, from my British and Australian friends, the portrayal of this sort of historical life-style is fairly accurate. Although, one must keep in mind that the show is much like a modern day soap opera, so there are the typical plot twists and turns, as well as leaps in time. Season 3 seems to be moving right along that soap opera pathway, complete with lots of evil plotting, back-stabbing relationships, exhilarating love stories, and (of course) a cliff-hanger ending to the season finale. We love the historical setting - perfect for a romantic flight of fancy. Well worth watching!	5.0	One of the best dramatic series!	2014-01-09	0	0	0

I started watching THIS SHOW AND GOT HOOKED ON IT. This is the most watched series ever to be watched on TV. This includeds the world watching this series from every country that it is shown in. Basically it is a story about an aristocratic family that takes place in the United Kingdom in the early 1900's.It involves the every day life of the Lords and Ladies of British society. I know, it sounds very boring but it is not. As a mater of fact it is very interesting and therefore holds your interest to come back and watch more.	5.0	Downton Abbey a must see	2014-01-02	0	0	0

My last five weeks was spent recuperating from surgery and I thought it the perfect opportunity to download Season 1 of the show.  Immediately, I was hooked and just finished Season 3 last night! I loved everything about it...the time period, the interplay between the servants and the family, the characters, story line,  the attention to detail in the house,  and the clothing of the time period.  I am, admittedly now, a Downton Abb-ict!  Cant wait for Season 4!	5.0	Downton Abb-ict!	2013-03-08	1	1	0

I am not criticizing anything, but know anything can be better somewhere. I enjoy the series as have been drawn to the UK for many of my 75 years. Was not a traveler until I reached the 40's. That was my first time seeing the Pacific ocean. Only country I have ever been to was over the border into Mexico.What I love about the series is that time in our history, that the classes were so separated. I find it so funny what snobs they are yet they don't recognize or declare themselves as snobs.I am addicted to the story and hope it goes on for many years.

It sucks eggs--big time--and and casts a pall over  the entire season. I find in its aftermath that I'm not especially interested to see what happens next.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A398JESK6O2PVR	Summerville	Like this series for the look at the time period and I don't mind drama, but in a &#34;Masterpiece Classic&#34; I want only realistic drama- the break down of social classes (Sybil marrying Tom, Rose out clubbing), WWI, the Titanic, the influenza pandemic, etc. I'm sick of the additional scheming by Thomas and O'Brien and how many soap opera scenes their schemes add because once one person finds out, you have to watch that person tell everyone else about it a few people at a time. Or worse, you have to watch them act awkward as they try to hide it.Even assuming real people could get away with as much as Thomas and O'Brien do, there are enough REAL drama plots in this show without creating a duo of heinous characters. I can't watch one show without feeling annoyed by petty soap opera drama. I gave up on Glee after the 3rd or 4th season because the great singing and dancing can be watched on You Tube while avoiding the stupid teenie bopper drama and the unrealistic Sue Sylvester character. Thomas and O'Brien are almost as unbelievable as her. Writers for these shows seem to think you can create interesting villains by making them soap-opera-evil and then tempering them over time to seem more human. If you're going to try for that kind of realism, you need to BEGIN with a character that is believable. Enough of the soap opera already.	3.0	"Sick of all the soap opera drama in a so-called ""Masterpiece Classic"""	2013-08-22	0	0	0

I have recommended this wonderful series to my family and all my friends.  They, too, are completely hooked on Downton Abbey.  At first my husband didn't want to watch it as he thought it would be a ""chick flick"" but half way through the first episode he, too, was hooked.  We loved the way the stories about the various characters evolved.  We discussed the characters as though they were friends.  That was fun as my husband only likes action and science fiction.  Unfortunately I saw on the PBS site about a major character dying and told him I was unhappy that I knew a character would be gone.  He guessed wrong.  When the scene occurred where it night happen I burst into tears and boy, was my husband shocked.  So everyone, if you don't want to know the end, don't let any spoilers spoil the show for you.  I've told all my friends to please watch the show in sequence and don't let anyone tell you anything.The acting is superb.  If you have a chance, read up on the family who lives in the castle.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2P7E13GQT7ZIQ	Susan	All the series of Downton Abbey follows the lives of the upstairs and downstairs families. Each, face life in their own way. I don't know how the upstairs families usually treated the downstairs people, in real life, but feel the Crowlrys are a good family. Happiness and sadness follow equally. Death comes to Downton in series three, but new life also comes. I've adored the whole series and, for me, might be one of the best to ever have been shown on television. Should I ever meet Julian Fellows, author of Downton, I would consider myself blessed.	5.0	Life	2014-04-07	0	0	0

However, I thought it was to be the UK unedited addition but instead it is the PBS version, complete with commercials. How dissappointing.  I have to fast forward through the Viking River Cruises and the Ralph Lauren commercials.  Not what I thought I ordered.

Except for the delight of Anna and John Bates, the rest of the story was depressing, sad, and irritating. Incredibly well acted which is what makes it so good at being depressing, sad, and irritating. Once into the story though, you have to keep going. I guess I just hope they only produce one more season and bring it to a close.	5.0	Season 3 Let Down	2013-02-21	1	1	0

I just received the entire Season 3 set yesterday.My computer won't recognize this disk.  If Windows Media tries to open it, I get a message "" Disk is empty"".  If the Blue Ray DVD software on the computer (CyberLinkPower - came with the Dell a year ago) tries to open it I get an error code and says it may not play newer movies without an update.  SO I update and it doesn't see the DVD.  If I use VLC media player, it says disk is empty.I don't want to watch on BluRay player simply because my husband isn't into this and that means it's in 'his domain'.I gave up and sent it back since I couldn't play this on my device(s).I'm sure of course, the CONTENT is amazing.

And, its hard to believe that Hugh Bonneville, who once played the daffy brother in Notting Hill plays this wonderful and elegant master of DA!  Maggie Smith steals the show with her witty zingers!

By the middle of the first series you realize they are written like real people and the heroes and villains have the best and worst of human frailties just like all of us. Now by this 3rd season I love all of them, even  the ones I love to hate! I am not a crier usually when I watch films but this one made me cry. I was upset for days. It is written like true life. The good guys don't always win and the bad guys don't always get caught and punished.

The acting is so good that you don't feel the characters are acting - I can think of no higher compliment. The sets and costumes are also well done - having studied history of fashion and been in that industry for most of my life, I feel I am somewhat discerning - I would continue to watch the show just for those two things.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1M0OSCFOAMAZO	taaj	"There is a tendency for sequels and follow ups to lose punch as time goes on. Stories get worn out and stale, but that is not the case here. The writers take tips from history and real life to keep things interesting. They do a great job of showing life from such widely different points of view that are somehow connected. If you get tired of the splendor of Downton, you are wisked away to Scotland and that completely different culture and landscape. You really get a sense of time flying by (modernity) and also standing still (tradition). It is such an interesting contrast. If you liked the first two, you will probably like this one. It has enough of the original elements and cast to feel connected, but enough variety and change to let you know that this is its own story.The only negative I see with this is the stereotyping of Americans. Shirley MacLaine's role as the loud, vulgar American is over the top. Her maid as the forward, sex hungry, inappropriate, ""progressive"" American is also irritating. The rest of the cast is much more multi-faceted than that. Why not give the Americans their due as well?Anyway, I can't wait for the next one."	5.0	Keep It Coming!	2013-02-04	2	2	0

I know that the writers cannot control their actors choices, but I was absolutely blown away by the two successive deaths of two major characters.  As much as I love the series and ALL of the actors, I have to say that the loss of these two characters materially changes the integrity of the story.  Shame, shame, shame on both actors for their hasty grab at fame brought by the exposure from the show!	3.0	Purchased it to get the entire season in advance.

This is a drama, soap opera that continues to keep me interested, but I can see that in the future that the drama could get tiresome.  For now it is intriguing allowing me to care about the characters...ONLY in fantasy.

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2FED3MWF5OU8M	tellmeastory	What a magnificent series Downton Abbey has been.  For this anglophile, traveling to Britain's historical past and witnessing the cultural and political changes, the beautiful countryside that is England still, the enviable elegance of the English language when spoken by the British actors, the charm of romantic story lines, the horror of war from the perspective of a country so close to the front, the characters themselves with whom viewers connected on a human and personal level, all of it--so rich in detail, completely and utterly irresistible from its beautifully crafted writing,to its cinematography, staging, costuming, and of course acting (bringing the story to life).Like so many fans worldwide, i was impatient for the third series and pre-ordered it as soon as  it was available on Amazon. Episode after episode of Season 3 kept me up late into the night, even with work bright and early the next day.  I cannot imagine how the people in England must have felt when their Christmas Special ended with such tragedy.  It felt so contrived, so completely predictable, even as the scene unfolded and Matthew, joyful, drove his gorgeous (British) car down the lovely lane.  Oh no....i thought.  You can't be serious....yet...there has been too much happiness...oh...the truck crested the hill...I was so angry at the writers.  Surely Dan Steven's leaving could have been handled better.  Killing him off seems vindictive, vengeful.  And this wonderful series is now nothing more than a soap opera.  I am so disappointed.	4.0	Loved this series until...	2013-02-26	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3VAXB8CDYY5BG	The Wingchair Critic	'Downton Abbey' (2010-present) is the outstanding period drama and British-American production created by Julian Fellowes.Unlike AMC's 'Mad Men,' which also took America by storm a little at a time, and also largely by word of mouth, 'Downton Abbey,' which considers Edwardian England, the Great War, and its aftermath, was predominantly created by native British citizens, and carefully analyzes the period it covers without wholly trashing it, as 'Mad Men' subtly and unsubtly does 1960s America on an episode-by-episode basis.In an era of exploitive programs like 'American Horror Story,' which is as extreme as anything ever produced for television, and which regularly traffics in horrific amputations, sadomasochism, genetic deformity, and torture, it is wonderful to discover a series like 'Downton Abbey,' which proves, among other points, that adults everywhere are absolutely starved for intelligent, ethical, and mature dramatic fare, such as was regularly produced in decades past on both sides of the Atlantic, especially in film.Opening in 1912, 'Downton Abbey' is the story of the aristocratic and genuinely noble Crawley family, who live in contented luxury at Downton Abbey, their immense Yorkshire estate, and of the lives of their multitude of servants, who the Crawleys treat with humanity, decency, and respect.Their fairly idyllic lifestyle is rattled by the loss of the family heirs on the Titanic, and then the coming of the Great War, which turns Britain and its social traditions upside down in a thousand painful ways.What makes 'Downton Abbey' almost radical in this age is that it refuses to denigrate the Edwardian aristocracy it examines. While both Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham (Maggie Smith) and American-born Lady Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern) are initially shown to be somewhat priggish and short-sighted, one of the themes of the program is the dual nature of most men.Thus, homosexual footman Thomas (Rob James-Collier) is, along with lady's maid Miss O'Brien (Siobhan Finneran), initially something of a villain, but as the series progresses, even sociopathic Thomas is shown to have, or to develop, a good side.Likewise, overlooked middle sister Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) foolishly betrays her elder sister, Mary (Michelle Dockery), but this action is shown to be a lapse, if still a serious one, in an otherwise good personal character.As a whole, 'Downton Abbey' believes in the predominantly ethical and decent nature of man. As such, it depicts both the aristocrat and the 'common' working man, such as Christ figure and valet John Bates (Brendon Coyle, whose performance dominates the first season), as capable of integrity, empathy, courage, nobility of purpose, and basic human goodness in all its forms.It is this vision of mankind that gives 'Downton Abbey' its power.Though the series has the occasional weak treatment of a plot thread--such as dignified butler Carson (Jim Carter) being revealed to have once been a vaudeville performer or the rather unconvincing return of an heir thought dead, 'Downton Abbey' usually steers clear, not of soap opera cliches unfortunately, but of the standard melodramatic treatment of them when they do appear.For 'Downton Abbey' to continue to thrive creatively, however, the writing has to remain focused primarily on the historical period, and continue to provide viewers with 'a window into the past' instead of becoming bogged down too heavily in the lives of the characters themselves. By Season Three, for example, the lame and long-suffering Bates has been put through so many sensational reversals of fortune that such events no longer seem very credible, and audience sympathy for the character wanes considerably.In Season One, the various characters appeared largely to represent objective principles as much as they were presented as three-dimensional human beings; in the opening episodes of Season Three, however, the same characters are instead depicted strictly in human terms, and the writing is far more self-conscious in every respect. Thankfully, by the fifth episode and following, the writing is the best it has been since the first season.'Downton Abbey,' in its worldwide success, should not be playing to its audience, but going its own way and forcing the viewer to make all the effort necessary to follow it.Still, 'Downton Abbey' remains outstanding on almost every level, from the writing, cinematography, set design, costuming, and score to the brilliant acting by Hugh Bonneville as the Crawley family patriarch, Dan Stevens as heir presumptive Matthew Crawley and Smith, McGovern, Dockery, Coyle, and well over a dozen others, 'Downton Abbey' sets a new standard for 21st century television, and, by extension, asks us to reconsider the lives we lead and the society we support today.All students of Edwardian England, of Rupert Brooke, Vita Sackville-West, Kenneth Grahame, J. M. Barrie, the Sitwells and others will admire and deeply appreciate this intelligent, thoughtful, and moving series.	5.0	Remembering Civility	2013-01-30	3	2	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1O3JUKPCYCV6T	Tiger08	Downton Abby is one of the best series ever shown on TV, certainly the very best that is being offered today. It is so refreshing to see that someone is still producing  quality programming today.I have now caught up through last night's 3rd season episode. This week's episode was one of the best and certainly the most heart wrenching episode so far.  The series profiles the best and the worst of our human experience--our actions and the changes life brings us.If you have not seen any of the series, PLEASE view them from the first episode of the first season. If you are an Amazon Prime member, the streaming is free through Season 2. If not, i recommend you purchase the first couple of episodes to see if you like the series. If so, you can decide if you like the series. You can purchase each season to download to your PC or iPad, etc. you can purchase the entire season at a better price than choosing each episode separately. All 3 seasons can now be purchased on DVD. Season 3 is over 1/2 over, and you can only purchase only the episodes shown thus far of Season 3. At the end of the season all episodes will be available for free streaming with Prime membership, but if you love it, you will want to purchase the entire series for future viewing. I am now watching every episode thus far in order. You will see many things that you missed the first time, or you will understand what is important, knowing the results.All in all, this is the best series being offered today! I would give it 12 stars if more than 5 were offered!	5.0	The best series on TV now!!!	2013-02-04	5	4	1

I missed Season 3 so I had to catch up before the start of the Fourth Season.  It amuses me that a show  depicting developed characters who are faced with realistic difficulties for their times should be such a smashing success in a medium which otherwise showcases base and vulgar garbage. Cheers for PBS and the BBC, and may the producers of other American TV stations enjoy the program as well, and learn from it.	5.0	Fascinating Tale	2014-01-06	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2BYRDPL6UNJ9J	Tom King	I ignored this series for a long time because I wasn't very much interested in the genre.  Now, having finished the third season I am convinced that it will be the last of the genre for a very long time because it is so uniformly excellent that no one will try to do it again because the bar has been set so high.  Like all good stories this one makes you care about the characters, makes you hope with them, scheme with them, wish you could give the boot to some of them, and, yes, even shed a tear of joy or sorrow with them.  The actors and writers have brought to life in this drama a cast of characters as compelling, interesting and unforgettable as any of the characters you meet in a Dickens novel.  The actors are truly some of the best in the world -- the epitome of their art.  As I watch them I sometimes think &#34;I have never seen anyone this talented before&#34;.  The cinematography and camera work is so imaginative that it makes even mundane scenes sparkling and theatrically rich.  I think the best writing, acting, directing, and cinemagraphic talent in the world is at work in this perfect storm of a story.	5.0	Exquisite	2014-01-31	1	1	0

With many thumbs up, there is little doubt that the third series won't be a hit with others.  There is a lot to follow with the woman disposal of men,  I find they lost a star with all their sexual adventures especailly with the youngest cousin going out with a black singer.  I couldn't make this up in my dreams let alone to write it in a series for the general public to figure out.	4.0	high tea	2014-02-19	0	0	0

The twists and turns are often unexpected and the show's creators are not afraid of taking big risks with the characters. This can definitely make it hard to watch when a beloved character is affected, but it shows that the story is the most important part of this project and not producers appealing to its fans. I like that.	5.0	I love this show.	2014-01-08	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ADD4S0JQ2HPQP	tyler e hollandjr	I was wondering what had happened to the ever-lovable Elizabeth McGovern one evening, just after watching her in a re-run of &#34;She's Having a Baby&#34;.  I searched her name on my Amazon Prime and &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; popped up and curiosity compelled me to  give it a look.  I decided to begin at the beginning with episode 1, season 1.  Now, I'm into season 3, having in the process become a loyal and avid fan, captivated by a wonderful cast and skilled story-telling.  The attention to detail is magnificent, not only as regards the abbey and its scenic environs, but also in the period costumes, particularly in the case of the sisters and their mother, as they capably model the l fashions of the day.  There's a lot to enjoy here.  Next time you're searching the channels, wondering what happened to quality programming and real entertainment, stop in at Downton Abbey.  All the family and servants will greet you warmly at the door and welcome you in for a wonderful viewing experience.	5.0	LOVE THIS SHOW!	2014-03-10	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A4DA0PEQR05W6	VALERIE L KELLER	Anyone who thinks this show is teaching us yanks anything realistic about British culture is fooling themselves, this is pure fiction but it's very entertaining.  A high-brow soap is how I think of it, characters are not always consistent and no one can be happy for more than 15 minutes in an episode before some new tragedy happens unexpectedly or a sudden catastrophe rains down on their heads (often predicated by one of the actors wanting out - these Brits are much quicker to bail on a TV series that is in the height of its popularity, maybe the cautionary tale of David Caruso didn't make as much of an impact overseas as it did here).  But I really enjoyed it nonetheless.  It's no Austen or Dickens (&#34;Bleak House&#34; is maybe my favorite British period piece ever made, and I've seen a lot of them), but it'll get your blood pumping and make you laugh and cry, shake your head and chuckle or shake your fist and mutter &#34;what a rotter&#34; under your breath in a fake British accent).	4.0	Season 3: the melodrama continues	2013-02-20	3	2	1

This series is amazing, with a richness of character development not seen in years.  It's wonderfully written, the actors are amazing, with the sets and characters giving us a glimpse into a bygone era.  When I was a little girl, we used to 'dress' for dinner and I never really understood why...now I do. My parents were just trying to uphold a 'standard'  one they were not able to uphold for long.  I've now lived long enough to see so many 'standards' and traditions leave for a more casual lifestyle befitting the trends of the day.  How interesting it is to watch a way of life ease away. Cannot wait for the next season...why do we have to wait a full year?  Really this is just too long.  What a story!	5.0	Best British Series since Upstairs Downstairs	2013-02-04	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	ASCOOYZBBCYXY	Vegas65	Like most of the free world, I love Downton Abbey.  I love PBS, always have.  This program just leaves me begging for more.I went through all of the eipsodes of season 3 for most of a full day, and now can't wait for the next season, and there had better be one!!!!  Maggie Smith, as well as all the major players, are superb.  I firmly believe this program is so popular, due to the fact, there is so little quality programs being produced these days, one's that don't involve sorid explicit depraved acts, violence, language, etc.  I and apparantely many more, crave a show with class, about class and what it means to have class.Manners and class in my humble opinion, went out the window decades ago.I'm just saying, but long live Downton Abbey and Maggie Smith.	5.0	A rainy day, cuddled up with Downton	2013-01-31	2	2	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A3D2N263WY01YI	Victoria	Love the development of the characters.  The shallowness of the upper crust is amazing to watch, but it is nicely balanced with the myriad of 'real world' problems that they confront. The servants' attempts at being mirror images of their masters (what a stupid word!) demonstrates the universal difficulties that humans must resolve - wealthy or not.I like the character of Cora (Countess Crawley / mirror is Mrs. Hughes) - she is a voice of reason and common sense. The episode where Sybil goes into labor was particularly difficult to watch, where Robert Crawley's reliance and habit of deferring to status actually  results in his daughter's death.	4.0	Really hooks you in.	2013-09-14	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A18D46Y6R0NQGT	Virginia	The continuing story of family in that long ago era is most interesting.  The writer brings you to many of the character's personal life and puts you deep into the story.  It is interesting to watch the characters show what was proper in those days and sometimes what was not acceptable as proper for the time.  The acting is high quality, the beauty of the area where it was filmed is superior.  I am always very anxious to see what the next segment has in store.  There are sad times, and there are happy times, which is just like real life.  It is most intertaining and well done.  Can't wait until Season 4.	5.0	Lovely Story	2013-08-27	0	0	0

Jo	Much drama going on, not just in the aristocratic humans upstairs, but just as dramatic and complicated drama downstairs in the buzzing lower 'working' quarters. They both had luckily become kind and considerate to each other. They had grown genuinely caring of each other, without the differences in their 'places' in the household, although still maintaining and honoring the fundamental codes as servants. But the deep humanity felt as people have sustained, regardless of their stature, and that shows a lot of humiliation as a beacon of hope.	5.0	Beacon of Hope in Humanity	2014-01-04	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A11WX8MONC0BP0	"vom357 ""palken1"""	I love the setting and characters and Seasons 1 and 2 - so my holdover affection for the show made season 3 episodes 1-3 watchable. However, they were repetitive, implausible, and most of all, horribly predictable.The first 2 episodes were made nearly unbearable by the gruesome appearance and over-acting of..... (no, didnt see it coming...)Shirley McClaine! She was awful - and like Lord Grantham, I was very pleased to see here depart back to America. Perhaps this is why PBS and/or the producers literally snuck the first two episodes in without fanfare or notice, never to be seen again. I started with Episode 3, but quickly realized something was amiss. I went onto Amazon to watch the missing episodes - don't bother! As for episode 3. I can at least say that the show quickly (mercifully) wrapped up the opening story lines, so perhaps the rest of the season will bounce back to its former quality and style.SEASON END UPDATE - Several of the story lines were back to top form but overall still a substantial drop off. Why they rushed to the finale by doubling the episodes was a mystery and the content of 2 hours was the same as 1 normal show - so again a disappointment. Sample nitpick - Did they somehow forget to explain why Bates was such a big shot in the prison? And without adding a spoiler I can say the finale was a big disappointment. Seems like the whole production became business and market ($$$) driven - like an American soap opera. That said I plan to watch Season 4 as this show - even with its drop - is still in the top tier of TV and movie productions.	3.0	Big Drop off from Seasons 1 and 2 (so far)	2013-01-20	3	2	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A16P5N8MNTXXU3	"V. R. Hutter ""v_rh"""	I love Downton Abbey but the Season 3 was not as good as the previous two seasons.  I was also very disappointed in the loss of a major character in the last episode who supposedly was killed in a motoring accident but in reality the actor wanted out of the series.  My favorite among the cast is the wonderful Maggie Smith who elevates the quality of any production.  This is a high-class British soap opera with millions of fans.  IMO, the writers need to introduce some new characters and rethink the story line for Season 4 bringing it back up to the standards of the first two seasons.	3.0	Not as good as Season 1 and 2	2013-04-27	1	1	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1PNO03VNAJ99C	"Walt R. ""Walt R"""	The only annoyance we ever had while watching this series on PBS was that we never knew when each series started, since we did not watch PBS regularly, and we never saw any announcements.  Since each episode in the series builds in dramatic power, we have relished seeing Downton Abbey in its entirety, while we await the start of season 4.My wife and i began watching DA during its first season on PBS, and were immediately hooked.  Excellent, witty dialogue; great direction and pacing; gorgeous settings in the house and grounds - I could go on and on.  Season three continues the outstanding performance.  If you liked the first two series, you'll be equally enthralled by the third.If you're new to the series, then, by all means, start at the beginning - the first season sets the stage where you get to know the characters, and watch as they develop through the years.  This is not a series carried by one or two stars, such as Maggie Smith or Hugh Bonneville, but devotes sufficient time to a wealth of characters, developing their story lines, drawing the viewer into almost a family relationship.After watching most of the third season last year on PBS, we were so affected, we bought the entire 1970s series of &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34; from Amazon and watched it.  While it is also very well done and holds up well over all these years, it simply doesn't approach the dramatic power of DA.	5.0	The Best TV series We've Ever Seen	2013-12-28	0	0	0

The range of each character is so thorough, and each storyline so intricately carved; reality itself couldn't be more perfect.The overlapping story arcs of pain, joy, birth, death, anticipation and regret are all so very real - and despite the period setting,  they are all quite timeless.Bravo.

I didn't notice a single change of actors in any major role.  This continuity makes the story that much more enjoyable.  My only regret is that, unlike the first two seasons, I'm now having to watch it piecemeal as are most fans who tune in each week for the initial episode broadcasts.  The dvd season era has spoiled me.  However, this is one show that I didn't want to wait for, and I've not been disappointed at all!

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	AY3FXAAUZ0CYV	WC Alaska	"This is a great series that's taken the world by storm. Excellent acting, superior dress and sets.It was hard losing Sybil, but this year the show loses one of it's main characters. As popular and excellent as this show is, I'm not sure if the series is still following the book. The second major kill-off was because the actor wanted to leave the series.  I went around two days moping because of that lol.I would like to mention that I hope someone else speaks up if they're having problems with the Blu-Ray UK version.The first two shipments from Amazon, disk 1 didn't work but disk 2 and 3 did.The last shipment, all three disks didn't work in our player. We have a large Blu Ray collection and they all play fine. I might also mention I tried a second machine and it didn't work in that one too.On the second set, I called in and had the misfortune of having to talk to someone from India who spoke pigeon English. When I explained to her what happened, she asked me to describe my DVD player and give her the model number! Then she said there would be an ""investigation"" into the claims I made of the faulty disks. My God! I am not trying to steal anything I want working disks! Then she read that the DVDs are for region 1/A for North America, and asked me if United States was in North America.Luckily, I used the automated online return/replace form and Amazon graciously sent out the third set. Sadly, also defective. We are now going to buy from Walmart or PBS because we know it will be a different batch of prints. We have been loyal Amazon buyers since 2000 but three times is enough.The show still has all the charm, class, and tear jerking moments of the first, I heartily recommend everyone to watch the series. It will teach us Americans a bit about how to conduct oneself in a civilized and courteous fashion. Excellent series."	2.0	Good season defective DVD's	2013-03-01	1	1	0

Then I saw Amazon could stream it and was delighted. Then I found I had to buy it. Well, ok, I bought it reluctantly. Then I find the software does not support hdmi or Apple TV. So we have to watch it on the iPad. Bad deal. I would wait to buy it until they get their software upgraded to watch it on a regular sized tv.	3.0	Runs but won't stream to tv	2013-08-29	0	0	0

The acting is top notch, the costumes are lovely and look authentic to the period, and the Abbey & grounds are beautiful. You get the feeling you have stepped back into the late Edwardian/early Georgian era. Now that I'm caught up with Season 3, I'm eagerly awaiting the start of Season 4 this fall. I highly recommend it. Thank you Amazon for making seasons 1-3 available on Prime and in HD quality.	5.0	Downton Abbey Season 3	2013-08-09	0	0	0

Those who have yet to savor the delights of Downton should start with season one and see what they're missing.This DVD set is a bargain- the cinematography is crisp, production values well preserved.  But I want to mention the service Amazon provided when my first order of Season 3 was discovered to have a factory defect making several episodes unplayable.I had purchased this DVD months earlier but had not gotten around to playing it until this summer.  When I discovered the defect in disc 2 I sent Amazon customer service one email.  Within a few hours they emailed me back to tell me not to send the defective DVD package back- they would simply overnight ship a replacement.  The very next day Fedex dropped off a new Season 3, which was defect-free.  The very next day!  One email.That's what I call good service!	5.0	Great Series, Great Service	2013-09-03	0	0	0

It did manage to exploit WWI to good effect, but it also had moments that simply were not completely thought through and a few convenient moments to get around tricky plot points.  Season 3 is definitely a step up for the writing, though the stakes are lowered now that the war is over.  That being said, it is season 3 and in British shows, that means some actors will choose to leave, which means some characters get written out with rather sudden ends.	4.0	An improvement over season 2.	2014-03-06	0	0	0

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A2O4A9TTST4RQK	Yellow Rose	I bought DA season 3 during pre-release just like I had season 1 & 2. The set arrived before the season had finished airing on PBS here in the U.S. so rather than spoil the anticipation, I continued to watch the remaining episodes week by week on TV. I still have not unwrapped these DVDs. First of all there is the shallow treatment of the characters we care about the most, especially the lack of the development of the relationship between Matthew and Mary. Then the plotline gone a-kilter what with poor Sybil, not to mention poor Edith, the introduction of troubled little Rose, the Jimmy and Thomas theme ad infinitum, and finally the coup de grace, the season ending, which takes all the enjoyment out of watching again. How uncreative of them not to figure a better way out of the predicament thrust upon them. I was shocked and felt betrayed as a loyal fan. Except for the continued beauty of the people, settings and costumes, season 3 would hardly be worthy of the Downton Abbey legacy.	1.0	More like soap opera	2013-03-17	5	4	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Z Hayes	I am an ardent fan of Downton Abbey and have watched all the episodes from Seasons 1-3. Season 3 in my opinion is not as great as the previous two seasons, primarily because I felt a lot of the subplots got resolved in a pat manner and some characters, significant ones at that, are killed off. I won't mention which ones so as not to spoil the experience for those who are yet to watch the series but some of the actors playing these roles wished to move on to other projects and so there was no choice but to get rid of their characters.I thought Season 2 was a sad season because of the war and the losses resulting from it, including the death of a well-liked character and some dramatic turn of events. However, after watching Season 3, I have to say that the current season wins hands down in being a downer. Bates (Brendan Coyle), who is valet to the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) and is married to head housemaid, Anna Bates (Joanne Froggatt) gets sent to prison for the murder of his first wife though he claims he is innocent. For much of this season, Anna spends what little free time she has chasing leads to clear Bates' name and set him free.Downton is also in serious financial trouble thanks to the Earl making some questionable investment choices. All this and there's a wedding to prepare for, the much anticipated wedding between heir Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) and Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery). Will Downton survive? Lady Sybil is pregnant with her first child with husband, ex-chauffeur Branson (Allan Leech) and comes to stay at Downton for the wedding, though later events may cause the couple to remain indefinitely at Downton. Lady Edith who is always unfortunate in matters of love, thinks she may have finally found happiness, but as is often the case with Edith, things don't always go according to plan.I admit that this season does have a lot of depressing events in it but despite it all, it remains a riveting and engaging watch. I love how Julian Fellowes balances the drama of both upstairs in the Earl's family as well as the politics of downstairs. Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan)suffers a medical scare, Mrs. Patmore finds romance, and footman turned valet Thomas Barrow (Rob James-Collier) displays his sensitive side. There are some interesting developments among the staff but one can always rely on butler Mr. Carson (Jim Carter) to remain steadfast and stodgy!Dame Maggie Smith who plays the formidable Dowager Countess Grantham is amazing as usual and has some of the best lines in the show. She delivers them with such panache and is definitely one of the stars of the show. I think she is indispensable to the show's continued success and is certainly one of the main reasons why I adore the series so much.The sets, costumes, and cinematography remain as exquisite as ever, and though I could have done with a little less soap opera and bad news this season, I still would not trade Downton Abbey with anything else on TV at the moment.	5.0	The Dowager Countess alone makes it all worthwhile	2013-02-17	3	2	1

1608838137	Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3	A1CS4YU0WNCV4M	ziggy7	There is so much to love about Downton Abbey--great production values, great acting--just as thousands of others have noted. The one real irritant to me is the constant victimization story line of Bates and now, his new wife. This guy has been under the gun since he first appeared on the show and it never seems to stop, with one false allegation after another. It's a tired sub plot  and since he seems to be an interesting character, I hope the writers do something more creative with him in the future.	4.0	Great series, with one drawback....	2014-05-04	0	0	0
