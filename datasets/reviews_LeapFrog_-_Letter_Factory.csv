B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1JZH8PYQ0WYT2	2006harvestmoon	I don't know what it is about this DVD exactly, probably the catchy tunes but it has captivated both my kids at a young age.  Usually my children were more drawn to puppet/character shows like Sesame St. or Blues Clues with real people in it but this one is cartoon and they both loved it. They learned phonics quite early and would sing the tunes from the dvd all day!	5.0	Both of my Childrens Favorite DVD at ages 1-3 years old!!	2013-05-29	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	ADUZNIFG18085	2Boys	"This is an entertaining and educational DVD that my boys love to watch!  The only down side is that is doesn't mention the c says the ""k"" and ""s"" sound and that vowels have 2 sounds.  Maybe the vowels would be too confusing for this video though.  I still give it 5 stars because I think this is a creative and fun way to teach preschoolers alphabet sounds."	5.0	The kids love it!	2006-12-31	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1E2SNS80G5TPL	2 great kids	My son is almost 5 and he has very little interest in learning his ABC's and 123's.  He would much rather play on the computer, ride his bike, or pretend he is a superhero.  The videos sat there after Christmas for a few days until he tried everything else out that he had got and now he watches them all day long.  One after another and he keeps amazing me how he knows his the sound for V or R.  He feels so smart now and these videos have made it so fun.  Even with a interactive game on the DVD too.  He loves it and I love that he is learning.	5.0	Best gifts this year	2006-01-12	1	1	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A11CUSIJDNG0Y2	A. Artman	We purchased this dvd for our 17 month old.  She was very familiar with the alphabet and could recognize all the letters.

My 2 yr old can now identify letters and their sound and beleive it or not my 1 yr old(16m) can say the sounds. This video has totally impressed me! I just bought the Number one and I hope it works the same. Oh, we also watched the word factory and My daughter loves it, but it's too advanced for the other two.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AGYR8RQVTWIWJ	A. Butterfield	A teacher friend let us borrow this video one weekend for our then 2 yr. old daughter.  She watched it twice and begged for more.  We couldn't believe how enthralled she was with the music and cute storyline.  Later that day she was playing with her magnetic letters and began to correctly identify some of the sounds.  We later bought the DVD, and we used the letter song to help her learn the sounds of all her letters. We have really enjoyed this Leapfrog DVD and many of the other Leapfrog products.	5.0	A great way to learn letters and letter sounds	2007-11-22	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1W0TXHNDQVRB9	A. Chen	Im pretty amazed. I've been trying to teach my 26 month old daughter to recognize letters but her attention span is basically zero. I bought a few different DVD's with letters (sesame street) and this one. This one is amazing. The content is organized and entertaining. The letters are on the screen for a long enough time without flashing away like some other videos. Even though each letter segment is different enough to be entertaining, they are consistent enough that she can recognize all the letters along with their sounds after watching about 15 times. She can watch the video over and over and sings along with it now.The DVD starts right into the letters without a lot of fluff and I like that there is one DVD chapter for each letter.	5.0	2 year old daughter knows all letters after watching 15 times	2010-03-15	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2F9XOEGQUP266	"A Child Without An Eye ""mutilatedlips"""	My daughter has been watching this DVD since she was just a few months old. She is almost 2 now at the time of writing this and the DVD has never gotten tiresome to her.It is a nightly request before bedtime and never tends to get annoying to my wife and I (like a certain purple dinosaur most likely would.)It is a good length and keeps her attention the whole time. We have watched her progress educationally with this dvd over time. It was an extreme help with first vocalizing the sound of the letters and then recognizing and saying the names of the letters.I'm amazed how well this show works. I'm a big fan of Sesame Street and she loves Elmo, but Leapfrog's Letter Factory beats out all the other educational DVD's we own.	5.0	Simply The Best	2011-03-04	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1BU1CDS7L6CB7	"A. Churchwell ""mom of Kyle"""	I have been trying forever to teach my 3 year old son his letters.  He had really been having a hard time with letter recognition even though he knew his ABC's.  I could not get him to associate the written letter for the letter name.  He would say that A was P or something weird.  I was starting to get worried that he may have a learning disability.  I bought this video and the Talking Word Factory not really expecting much.  Within a week he knew his letters!!!  He is the kind to want to watch a video over and over and since this is educational I did't mind.  Boy did he ever learn from this video.  He now (within a month) knows every letter and letter sound!!!!  I am so proud of him.  I thought there was a real problem but now I see that I just needed a way to put each letter into something interesting and that related to the letter and letter sound.  I can't say enough about these videos.  I thought the Talking words Factory would be a little over his head but he can now say that A E I O U are vowels. Even if he isn't quite sure what vowels are I think it will help when the time comes to learn vowels in school.  He even has been learning about similar sounding words such as bat, cat, mat.  I can't wait to see what the next Leapfrog videos are about.  I hope they will help us with numbers since that is another area we have trouble with.  I love Leapfrog!!!	5.0	Best teaching video ever!!!	2004-09-03	1	1	0

It was recommended by his Kindergarten teacher during their orientation about a month before classes started. I order it because I could not find it at stores. My son loved it from the first time he watched it. He knew some of the letter sounds, but the video helped him learn all of them well before school started. Best of all, he didn't feel like he was doing a chore or ""homework,"" which he actually doesn't like, but instead he was enjoying a video and learning as a result. All the Kindergarten teachers at his school spoke well of this video, and they were quick to asure us they are not receiving any benefit from the endorsement of it; maybe they should."	5.0	Letter Factory Video Review	2009-09-05	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1FR60Y3S1H6VX	ADR 98	Not that this series needed another rave review, but we love all the Leap Frog movies.  My son (2 years, 2 months old) just did the alphabet flashcards and named all but 4 letters (confusing O with Q and F with E).  He also understands the sounds they create.I can't believe it...and I know it's b/c of this great video.  Thanks so much, Leap Frogs!

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A28DO6T6XGIK23	A. Ferrell	"I have had several friends who love this video, and whose children learned a lot from watching it, so I bought it. I thought it was more of an educational DVD that reviewed letter sounds. The letter sounds are introduced, but in the context of the plot of a cartoon show. Most cartoons annoy me, and this is one of them. There's a lot of extra stuff that I don't necessarily want my almost-two-year-old saying, ""Okie-Dokie-Artichokey"" being one of them. And it's annoying to sit through all of the beginning and end plot of the show surrounding the alphabet sounds. I'd recommend watching someone else's copy before buying one for yourself.We also bought the Leap Frog alphabet fridge magnet set that uses the same catchy song...highly recommend that over this video to teach the sounds."	1.0	Did Not Meet Expectations	2009-09-27	32	9	23
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AF8V03PAKD5G7	A.

In the past year, she has learned all about letters and their sounds.  Almost immediately, she began to sing the catchy song heard in the show.  She really did enjoy learning letter sounds and still watches it regularly, by choice, a year later.	5.0	A MUST Have for pre-schoolers	2013-10-29	0	0	0

Two different people recommended this DVD to us, and it has been amazing!  There is a room for each letter, with that letter making its sound, and a catchy tune for each letter.  For example, in the ""E"" room there is an old Letter ""E"" in a rocking chair, and every time the young frog says something to him, he says, ""eh?"" (the ""e"" sound).  The song for each letter is to the tune of ""The Farmer in the Dell,"" and says, ""The (letter) says (sound), the (letter) says (sound), Every letter makes a sound, the (letter) says (sound).""  I knew it was a success when an older child said a letter, and my son broke into song! :-)  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD!!"	5.0	Fun and educational letter-learning guide	2006-11-09	0	0	0

Im planning to show it to her at about 18 months when she might be able to follow the story a bit better.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2HUKDYPATWREE	Albert E.	The DVD brilliantly teaches the letter names and sounds of the letters.  A wonderful head start for kids learning to read.  Along with some other resources, such as the later Leap Frog DVDs, the Your Baby Can Read Series, and films with subtitles, young children can learn to read effortlessly.  Leap Frog is an excellent building block. [Similarly, for those interested in teaching their babies about music, a DVD called Trebellina works in a similar way.]  Hurray for Leap Frog!!	4.0	Brilliantly conceived!

It taught my two year old all her letter sounds.In the story, Tad visits all 26 letter rooms in the talking letter factory and learns what each letter looks like and what sound it makes.  Each letter and sound is presented in a creative way.  The video also has a catchy song for learning letter sounds.The video helped teach my children the alphabet, and I've heard good things about it from friends, too.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A325PCR1AV4U7N	Alvin Liau	Leap Frog - Letter Factory (2003)Buy this DVD now - it is that good.  We tried teaching our two year old his alphabets using flash cards and the Leap Frog Fridge Phonics but his attention span was never long enough, he knew his A through G, but never stuck around long enough to learn more.  After watching the Letter Factory DVD for about 10 times, he now knows them all!  In addition, he is beginning to sound the letters and plays with the Fridge Phonics toy a lot more.  The coolest thing is that when we are out somewhere, he will point to a store sign or billboard and yell out the letters he sees.  The DVD is well put together and manages to hold our son's attention.  It's great that it isn't too long since we try to limit his tv time - the show's length works out well during his dinner time.Alvin Liau	5.0	Simply Awesome.	2005-03-23	2	2	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A5Y1JK8JTXMTK	"Always Shopping ""Mother of Goodness"""	My 3-yr old loves this video! We rented it, and after watching it once she began repeating the sounds of the letters. I have even overhead her on other occasions trying to sound out words she sees which is FABULOUS!! Although the video does not address that fact that some letters have more than one sound, it is a great start for children to understand the importance of letters and opens the door to reading. I purchased the reading system many people may have seen on TV but her response was far better with this video. And, it actually teaches her to read words rather than memorize them. I will recommend this video to everyone I know with toddlers, it's definitely a good choice.	5.0	My 3-yr Old Now Sounds Out Words!	2009-07-26	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3P7Y3C61TC3P	"Amanda ""Amanda"""	Well I purchased this video for my three year old daughter.  It was highly recommended by my older daughters Kindergarten teacher.  She said that every child that had watched this video in the preschool years went into Kindergarten knowing all of their letter sounds.When the video arrived I was skeptical that she would even be able to make it though its entirety.  It was annoying at best...for me anyway.  Repeating the same tune over and over again, inserting the different letters and their sounds.  Well she loved it!!  We watched it everyday before nap time for a few months.Quality wise I think that the makers of the film should have used lower case letters instead of uppercase because it is crucial for a child to recognize these first if you want them reading early.  Better animation would have been nice.  What do you want for under $10 right?  But let me tell you this much...after a few months she knows ALL of her letter sounds.  I have made my own flash cards for her using lowercase letters and we no longer watch the video.  Instead we sing the song using my letters.  The best part....my two year old son knows most of the letter sounds as well.  He is barely talking, but if you show him a letter card he will make its sound.I highly recommended this to everyone parenting a toddler!

I take away his toys and try to make him tell me the alphabet and he just didn't pay attention. He loves watching cartoons so i first showed it to him on youtube and he loved it so i decided to buy the DVD. He had trouble with his letter sounds and now he's improved greatly. I recommend this DVD to any parent with a child having issues with their alphabet. I love this. I read a lot of reviews and was hesitant at first what to buy, but i tried it on youtube, he liked it and i bought it and i'm glad i did.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2ETXGF2ZUV3G4	"Amazon Customer ""cyao12"""	This video is the cleverest, most entertaining way of teaching phonics I have seen yet.  Although I'm not a great fan of the Leap Frog graphics, they do have a catchy way of making you remember all the sounds.  I think my three year eight month old son pretty much memorized all the sounds after watching the video just three or four times.  We followed up with the Word Factory, so now he understands the concept of letters combining phonetically to make words.It's not one of his favorite videos, but I think that he already learned the lessons to be learned, so it was money well spent.	4.0	Clever system	2004-05-13	5	5	0

My daughter enjoyed it, but my 2 year old son liked it even more. He watched it nearly every day and it wasn't long before he knew all of  his letters AND the sounds they make. I hadn't worked with him on letters and sounds prior to him watching this video. I highly recommend this. It's a great tool to assist your child in learning his letters and the sounds.

I used it at the tail end of the year last year to help introduce the more difficult letters like x, y, and z. Each time we watched a segment, the children wanted more.The story takes place in a working letter factory where they are manufacturing letters and teaching them their sounds before going off to books, or wherever a letter is needed. Each letter has to be taught their own sound. For instance: a monster scares the letter ""a"" and it says ""ah!"". The letter ""c"" is c-c-c-cold! The letter ""o"" lives in a jungle and swings from vines like Tarzan while saying the short o sound.The dvd is divided into 27 short (30 seconds or so) chapters with each letter containing it's own chapter and an intro as the 1st chapter. This makes it very easy to pop in with each letter and help learn the story of that letter before going on to do activities around it.Bottom line: I reccommend this for all parents of preschoolers.

We do have some other reading programs - but I know the letter sounds he is learning is coming from the DVD is because he does the action that they do on the DVD for each letter (he will jump for J, kick for K, sign O and L for those letters, and he even vibrates when he does the V sound)  It is so cute seeing him act out the sounds.	5.0	My 2 year old son loves to act out the letter sounds	2010-11-05	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3ARYJ9K6VU5ZB	Amber Sawyer	I've been teaching with this movie in my Kindergarten classroom for the past 4 years and wasn't sure if the students were picking up much from it, but I kept showing it mostly because the students LOVE it.  I figured at the very least it helps bring in several modalities to learning; visual, auditory, musical, kinesthetic (these students usually end up doing the motions the letters do in the video).I've been home on maternity leave for a few months and one day I decided to play it for my 3 year old son (just to get him to be quiet for a few minutes).  I personally haven't been teaching him any letters or sounds because I know he will pick them up in preschool next year and didn't want him to be bored. Not to mention teaching him something like the letters and sounds just didn't seem like much fun AT ALL as he is one of those hyper boys that doesn't like to pay attention to detail.  After watching this movie just once my son started telling me the letter names and sounds.  He's only watched it maybe 5 times but he can identify 19 of the 26 letters, with the sounds.  I know people think I'm pushing him, but I just keep telling them about this wonderful DVD.I have the 5 disc set from my classroom (Letter Factory, Talking Words Factory, Talking Words 2 (Code Word Caper), Learn to Read At the Storybook Factory and Math Circus) and I can say they are ALL worth the money.	5.0	Amazing Movie	2010-02-20	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2BCT6J3BE3WN3	A Mom	"I purchased all 5 of the Leap Frog DVDs after reading the reviews. I too am very pleased w/the videos. My son isnt even 3yrs old yet and can recite the alphabet, recognize all letters upper case and lower case, knows the order of the alphabet. He can sign (ASL American Sign Language) every letter of the alphabet. He can write most letters (not in a straight line but recognizable) A C D E F G H I J K L M O P Q S T U V W X Y Z. Most of this was by 2 1/2 years old. So of course when I saw these DVDs I knew they would take him to the next level. And they did, at 38 mos old he watched the Leap Frog Letter Factory 3 times and knew every sound every letter makes. I would sing the catchy song ""Every letter makes a sound the G says..."" and he would respond w/the ""G"" sound. Now he says ""G"" then the letter sound after it.2 wks ago we moved to the Talking Word Factory and now one month before his 3rd birthday he can spell from 12-15 words. CAT DOG CAR COW BLUE BOY GIRL STOP GO RED BOOTS are a few. He can spell his first and last name. I am looking forward to moving on to the other videos. Now of course all of this isnt due to just the videos but this has been a very helpful tool. I suggest these videos to everyone who has a child close to his age. As long as my son shows the interest in letters and numbers and spelling we will continue to keep up the pace and progress through to the next video. Besides he enjoys learning so much.These videos are priced so reasonably and the children get so much out of them. I played these 2 dvds in the car while on the way to an amusement park and the other child in the car was so interested in them she didnt say much the whole way to the park, she will be in the first grade.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A27B6QFBF4QVWT	Amy Palmer	"I would like to highly recommend the Letter Factory Video. My 2 year old started talking a little late, but within 2 months of starting to talk, he could identify every letter of the alphabet and tell you it's sound because of Leap Frog line of toys. I didn't work to teach him as all.  He learned it from their toys.  He would watch the video and then play with the Fridge Phonics toy.  His daycare is amazed and has purchased the Letter Factory video for all of the children to watch.He will be turning 3 in January, 2005 and now he can already tell me what letter a word starts with, such as, ""What letter does the word 'top' start with?"" He will then say, "" 'T', 'T' says t.Also, my 3 year old nephew was not understanding letters at all, but after 2 weeks with the combonation of the Video and Letter set, he now can identify all of the letters and tell you what they say.Leap Frog makes amazing educational toys!"	5.0	My 2 year old learned all of his letters and sounds!!	2004-12-05	1	1	0

He will sing the songs, which are the letters and the letter sounds.  This brings joy to my heart because my son is autistic and he didn't start talking until after he was 3 years old.  So now he's learning letters and their sounds, its a beginning to him saying more words, which is exactly what he's doing.  My 2 year old daughter loves it too.  She'll sing along with her brother the songs to the letter sounds.

She began reading and decoding words at age 4. My second child, now 3, watches the video frequently and shared it with her friends at daycare. The daycare provider and parents have been amazed and thrilled at how well all of the 2-3 year olds are doing with letter recognition and sounds. It's so superbly done and is just the perfect length for the attention spans of pre-schoolers. The kids beg to watch it, and are truly learning!The other thing I love about this is that it is reinforced with other Leap Frog products. The song used to teach the letters and sounds are also used in the refrigerator magnet toy. The continuity is great! As a teacher, I am always on the look out for quality, educational products, and Leap Frog is always excellent.We've now progressed to the Talking Word Factory DVD and my 3 year old enjoys it just as much. She calls out the letters and sounds out the words along with Tad.I have searched and searched for educational tools for my kiddos and this is by far the best I have come across.

She even can memorize the colour of each letter and can relate simple words with the letter. This is really unbelievable, this dvd is very entertaining and at the same time is educational. She can ask to watch the dvd one day a couple of times, which I have to restraint her from watching too much.I definitely will recommend this DVD to all children who is going to learn about reading.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3J3TI38YOX3JT	"""asher622"""	"I have two little boys, age 4 1/2 and 18 months, who have been recieving Leapfrog toys from my mother-in-law since they were infants, and they always seem to be the toys that get the most play time.  So when my husband saw the ""Letter Factory"" and ""Word Factory"" DVD's and suggested that maybe Santa should bring them to us for Christmas, I figured they might be worth trying.  I was totally unprepared for the effect these DVD's have had, and continue to have on my sons, especially the 4 year old.  We have been trying here and there over the last year to get him interested in the alphabet, but he was always too busy with other things to really get into it.  We stuck this DVD into the player on Christmas day and have played it at least once a day since, and both of my boys are glued for the entire 30 minutes every time it is on.Here is the reason I am so impressed, and therefore writing this review:  My four year old walked up to me just now, looked at my shirt and informed me of every letter printed on it, AND what the letter sounds like, AND a list of words that start with the letter mentioned, without difficulty.  There were 15 different letters.WOW.This is all a result of the Word Factory and Letter Factory DVD's, and we have had them for less than a month.The creators behind this DVD set are brilliant to say the least.  They somehow seem to know just what goes on inside preschoolers heads.  The characters and songs are cute without being ""cutesy"" and they somehow manage to repeat each letter or word and its sound several times without being redundant.  The main adult character, Professor Quigley, teaches the three siblings, Leap, Lily and Tad, by helping them complete a project.  The kids learn by working alongside the professor, as opposed to being talked down to or simply lectured to.  And because of that they feel like they are really accomplishing something.  All of this is done in such a subtle way that I had to sit down and watch it all the way through to figure out exactly why it is so effective.  Simply put, when my 4 year old watches this, he sees that the kids are the ones accomplishing the goal and reaping the benefits and not just watching the grown-ups do everything fun and exciting.  Once again, whoever created these DVD's knows how to get (and keep) the attention of preschoolers, which is a pretty tough thing to do.Obviously, my 18 month old is too young to grasp the structure  and objective of these DVD's, but he is just as entranced with them as my oldest, which says alot for a toddler just begining to speak is first coherent words.  I am looking forward to seeing how quickly he starts putting the concepts together the way my 4 year old has.My only dissapointment with these DVD's is that they didn't come out a year ago!

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2KKO5PJ2MYTRY	"Ashlie Harris ""harris_crew"""	I am extremely impressed with the whole series of Leap Frog DVD's. I especially like The Letter factory, word factory and Talking words factory 2. They are fun to watch and extremely educational! I have been amazed at how quickly my children have picked up their letter sounds. My six year old daughter was already reading, but after watching these movies she has improved a great deal. My four year old daughter started reading after viewing these movies for a couple weeks. My three year old daughter knows all her letter sounds. Just the other day she put some refrigerator magnets on our fridge and sounded them all out to make a word. My 20 month old son knows many of the letter sounds just by watching the Letter Factory. He points out letters in books and tells us the sounds they make. They all love the whole series and ask to watch them over and over and over again. I have never come across any other series that have caught my children's attention like this. They love the catchy songs. My six year old loves the talking words factory 2 that teaches about vowels and the long sounds vowels make. I would suggest these movies to anyone with preschool aged children.	5.0	The Leap Frog DVD's are awesome!	2007-03-08	0	0	0

My [young]daughter after seeing this dvd knows all her alphabet sounds!!! But she doesn't know what each letter is quite yet...  All and all, she learned a whole lot from this dvd and she loves to watch it, my son is one and he also tries to copy the sounds too!  It's great!!!  The only flaw is that the L sounds like an O, I don't understand why they made the sound like that, and the X sound is kind of confusing for kids!  But, I would recommend this product to anyone, it's well worth it for a good price too!!!!!	5.0	My kids love it!!!!!!!	2004-04-08	0	0	0

(He tells him he's lost his voice when he hasn't.) When the younger brother notices what happened, it just gets shrugged off. (The older brother accidentally speaks.) It's never discussed.It may seem trivial to some, but I really wish they discussed the lie rather than shrugging it off.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1D4URR4XNWYK6	Avid Reader and Mom	"My son received this video as a gift when he was 9 months old.  He is now 18 months as still loves it.  For him, it is very engaging - he loves music and he seems to like the repetitive letter-sound song.  As he has gotten older, he tries more and more to imitate the sounds he hears when the characters enter each room.  He also calls out the names of things he sees in each room. Overall, I think this is a decent video for exposing young children to letters and sounds in isolation.There are a few things about this video that ""irk"" me.  I have a strong background in linguistics and early reading and the video presents some sounds for letters that are not completely accurate.  Specifically, it is important when teaching the sounds of letters in isolation not to add vowels sounds to the consonant sounds.  For the letter L the video presents the sound as ULL with the U emphasized prior to the L sound.  This is very inaccurate - we don't say ULOLIPOP, etc.  Also, for the letter Q the sound is presented as QWA.  I find this very frustrating because Q makes a K sound, and it is only Q with U that makes the QWA sound.  I am fully aware of the common tradition in education to teach students the Q sound with the U attached.  Most of these people argue that students should be taught QU together because ""Q is always followed by U"".  This is not true.  While there are very few words that start with Q and are not followed by U - they do exist (QAT, etc.)!Having said this, even with these few problems, I have yet to find a video that presents letter-sound associations in isolation that does it as well as this video."	4.0	Great video - a few issues	2009-11-14	2	1	1

My five-year old really wasn't very interested in learning the names of the letters, let alone their sounds.  He LOVES this DVD and requests it every day.  We've had the movie less than two weeks and he's picked up so much, constantly mimicking the sounds he his hearing in everyday speech, and he's so interested in writing and putting letters together now.  I was highly skeptical of all the rave reviews I read about this DVD, but they're true!!!!My only, and very small, issue is that the movie gives only one sound for each letter, although quite a few letters make two sounds - c, a, e, i, o, u, etc.  The vowels aren't such a big deal, though, since the name of the vowel is its long sound.  We had a little trouble with ""c,"" and remembering that it can sound like an ""s.""  It's really not a huge problem, but is worth mentioning.I would definitely recommend this movie.  It's a great tie-in to the LeapFrog fridge magnet alphabet set, too (which does mention both sounds for those certain letters)."	5.0	Love it!	2012-03-04	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1K6PG34YW85DJ	Baby Enthusiast	"My 2 year old son LOVES this video.  He never has seen a cartoon before this so I wasn't really sure if it would capture his interest but it did for the whole thing!  My son loves to repeat the letters and sometimes (he has the fridge set too) he will run into the kitchen and get the letter they are singing about.  He just turned two and he can sing his whole alphabet, reconizes most of the letters and knows the sounds most of them make.  While this video is not soley responsible for this, I do think it played a big part (esp. with letter recognition and sounds).  Relatives comment all the time that they cannot believe how much he knows at his age and the pediatrician said these are 3 year old skills.  The reason I gave it only 4 stars and I am surprised no one else has mentioned this, but for the letter K they do K is for kick and they show the letter's kicking the wall.  Whenever my son gets his letter k off the fridge he runs over to the wall, kicks it and says ""kick"".  I then have to explain to a barely two year old that it is not okay to kick the wall they just do it on the video to show the letter sound. I can't imagine with all the words out there they chose this one.  One other thing - not nearly as important to me as the kicking is that if you sit and watch it with your child, Professor Quigley is extremly annoying.  Not a big deal if you don't watch it with your child but he will drive you nuts if you sit and watch it or are even in a room where you can hear him.  That is a minor flaw considering the educational value in it.  All in all I think this video is a very effective tool at teaching letter sounds and the alphabet and would highly recommend it."	4.0	Almost perfect	2006-09-22	4	2	2

He's now 20 months old, and when we point to any letter in the alphabet (on a sign, in a book, his letter magnets, etc.) he can tell us not only the name of the letter, but the sound it makes.This past weekend, we were in a store, and there was a sign that said ""hot.""  He sounded out each of the letters for me when I pointed to them, and I was able to (I think) help him start to see how the sounds come together to make words.  I was a lot more excited about the whole thing than he was.  I have to say, though, it is pretty amazing to see your little one start down the path of becoming a reader, especially so young.This DVD really is remarkable.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A25Y4AKGA0JVR	BerryDirl	Most people swear by their kids learning their letters through this DVD. It didn't work for any of mine but each child learns differently. This video only teaches the uppercase letters and only teaches one sound when in fact some letters have multiple sounds which isn't necessarily bad but it definitely doesn't teach your kids all about letter sounds although there are the basics. I think they did a great job animating how the sounds should go to give a child a reminder about the sounds but some of the consonant letters give a vowel sound first rather than just the consonant sound. All of my children are very much hands on learners and so maybe it's a learning style issue as to why none of them caught on with this and didn't make a good reinforcement to learning the letters for my kids. However it is a very cute video and works well for most kids.	3.0	Doesn't work for all children	2013-12-04	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3G6LRHIPFG071	Black Orchid	This is seriously one of the best ones that I've seen, like, ever.  My 16 month old runs around making the sound for letter c, and my 3 yr old and 5 yr old love this dvd.  I bought the book Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons by Siegfried Engelmann, and this DVD would work perfectly with it.  Both teach the proper letter sounds, which is the first step in learning how to read.  This is the best thing for teachers and also for homeschooling like I am doing.  Perfect, wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  Follow this up with the LF Talking Words for your 5 year old, the words in that dvd are also in the book that I mentioned, so it makes it fun for them to recognize the words once they read it aloud, they remember seeing it on the Talking Words dvd.  :)	5.0	The best ABC teaching!	2008-04-17	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A99XDTY6B9482	B. L. Christensen	"I have never felt strong enough to actually take the time to write a review.  I am a certified k-6 teacher who has told everyone I know about this amazing movie and now I am telling you...This was the first (out of 4) Leap Frog Movie that my children watched.  My 3 1/2 year old and 2 years 2 month old boys are allowed to watch 1 movie a day.  Each Day they agreed, in excitement, to watched this movie.  Under a week my 3 1/2 year old knew his letter sounds. He could sing the letter sound song almost as fast as he could sing the alphabet. After a week, he amazed us when he sat down on the ground and wrote out the entire alphabet like a 4th grader.  Had NO idea he could write like this!  Shortly thereafter, the 2 year old knew all his letter sounds and letter recognition.Talking Words Factory:  I was so impressed that I bought them the Talking Words Factory that 2nd week.  I wasn't surprised that my 3 1/2 year old began to spell, writing, and sounding out 3 letter words.  He told me all about how the vowels were all sticky and their job was to stick letters together to make words.  He went around singing the vowel song.My kids loved the videos so much that for 10 months...My son's (who used to play with Thomas the Trains and puppies) were obsessed with letters and words.  They made their own letter and word factory machines out of their toys and tubs, drew each letter cartoon character, and sang the letter and vowel songs, and the older one wrote, yes wrote, many of his own homemade books.  I knew there might be a problem with this obsession when all his arts and crafts from pre-preschool came home with letters all over them in place of eyes, noses, etc!Talking Word Factory 2:  It doesn't stop there...They got the Talking Word Factory 2 and Math Circus when they came out this Christmas. In a couple of days, the now 4 year old, was telling me all about sh, ch, th, and other blends.  He told me how the silent e at the end of the word made the other vowel say its name (long vowel sound).  He went on to tell me also how ""when 2 vowels go walking the first one does the talking."" And he wrote and read new complex words such as, boat, home, dime, wait, etc.  This really increased his ability to read many, many new words - 8 letter words too!Math Circus:  They loved it too!  Though it is fast moving for beginners, it is entertaining and has an easy concept.  Adding and subtracting now comes pretty easy for my 4 year old.  I gave him a math work sheet for addition and subtraction just for kicks.  Wouldn't you know it, he did all of them with no problem. He was so interested in adding that he started asking about problems such as 3 + 3 + 3.  Which helped him learn the concept of multiplication 3 x 3, 3 x 4, etc.  But, we told him that he had plenty of time to learn that later!The only negative comments that I have to say about these Leap Frog videos:  Nothing, Oh, except that I wish my children weren't so obsessed with letters!  They eat, breath, and sleep letters.  Sometimes I just wish they would play with the trains, cars, and other toys.  They will have their entire school life to learn about letters and reading!  I just hope that when the time comes for school that they won't have grown board of it!Other Leap Frog learning tools that reinforce what they learned on the videos:LF Fridge Phonics Magnets - Love it.  It sings each letters song when you put the letter in the hole.LF Word Whammer Fridge Phonics Set - LF just came out with this.  I know that they will love.  I bought it for the next birthday!  It is like the Fridge Phonics, but you can spell 3 letter words.LF Letter Factory Board Game - Love it too!  It is interactive and the board game talks and sings!LF Sing Along Letters Flash Cards & CD - Songs from the DVDs.  Not that you don't hear the songs sang enough from your children!Wish they would make computer CD's too!LF Leap Pad - Fun but they got board with the same books over & over.  $14 a book!There are many others, but I had to draw the line somewhere!If you check all the other reviews, I am not alone.  Only two out of 121 people gave this movie less than 5 stars!  It is about time someone made a movie that parents and children both agree on!

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AHRFXNAUK9BO4	BMK77	"I bought this for my almost-3 year old son recently on the recommendation of a friend. My son immediately took to this video, which he fondly calls ""The frogs"". It's about 30 minutes so not too long. Within a couple of days, I could ask him ""What sound does a P make?"" and he'll say ""Puh"". ""What does the F say?"" and he'll reply ""ffff"" with his arms flapping. Something about the presentation/repetition of the sounds really makes it stick in that 2 year old brain! I'd say 2 1/2 is probably the earlist a child would be ready or interested in it. My 1 1/2 year old wanders off when it's playing - not quite ready.I'd highly recommend this to any child aged 2 1/2+. I can't vouch for long how they stay interested since we're still watching it regularly. It will go on my Christmas gift-giving list for any children around this age, that's for sure!"	5.0	Noticed an improvement immediately!	2011-08-22	0	0	0

Now when he plays with his Leapfrog Fridge Phonics, he says the sounds and identifies the letters before the toy does!  The only difference between the toy and the DVD is that the toy gives 2 vowels sounds (long and short) for each vowel, while the the DVD just focuses on the short vowel sound.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A323CBFD17JRHM	Brandon Harris	"I bought this for my three year old and my two year old.  After watching it a handful of times, they know almost every letter and can even recognize the non cartoon ones on flashcards or in books.  They can even be asked, ""what does the H say?"" or ""what letter says haa?""Warning to parents, it is an annoying cartoon as it repeats the same song for every letter...but without that repetition, I don't think it would be nearly as effective so I just turn it on and ignore the movie for a short time if it is too bothersome to me.Some others reviewed the movie and said how disturbed they were with the incorrect sounds like the L saying ""ull"".  I thought it sounded weird at first too but if you think about it, it is correct but it's just a little less obvious in real speech.  I think as your child learns to read, the awkwardness will drop away.I only wish that they lowercase letters were also introduced in this video.  They are seen in a few places in the background but are not very prominent.  I know it's a method of teaching that allows for teaching the lowercase later, but I wish they were at least a little more obvious in the video if not totally taught too.  (Maybe Leapfrog needs to make a ""lower case letter factory"" movie.  LOL ;) )It is deffinately a good buy.  I bought 5 more of them and we've watched them but are not quite ready to form words and stuff yet, but I'm so excited about these videos!Also, my newly turned 1 baby is watching this video and is mimicking the sounds that the letters make.  He's had a slow vocabulary so far but introducing new sounds and tongue movements, has really helped him too.I'm very, very impressed with this video and would recommend it for anyone.  Just buy a set of ear plugs if you are easily annoyed by too much repetition.  :)"	5.0	Quick teacher!	2010-06-28	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A29V0E1QN6IXVN	Brenda Martinez	"There is a reason why the majority of Leapfrog reviews are five stars -LeapFrog: Letter Factoryis the perfect mix of educational content and entertainment. I am convinced that it is one of the best children's DVDs to ever hit the market.I have two beautiful boys: the oldest is nearly five and the youngest is 18 months. My oldest was diagnosed with PDD-NOS. While he does well in other subjects, he had shown some delays with speech and used to get frustrated and agitated when I tried to sit him down to read.Six months ago, my best friend suggested I play some educational DVDs for him. She bought me a copy of Letter Factory to play for the oldest. ""Blown away"" best describes how I felt when I saw him fall in love with the DVD. I literally cried I was so happy. Now all he wants to do is watch it. The most amazing part is that not only has his speech has significantly improved, but he has started to read books on his own!After seeing how great ""Letter Factory"" was for my oldest I tried showing it to my youngest. Unfortunately it was a little too advanced for him, so I did some research on Amazon to find a more age-appropriate DVD and ended up buying theTiny TutorDVD set. The videos are very simple and slow paced but really hold his attention. After about three months of watching my youngest son has picked up most of the numbers and a few letters. I am saving ""Letter Factory"" for when he is older and actual reading (not just word recognition) becomes more important.The rest of the Leapfrog series is now on my Christmas list. I know it sounds crazy but ""Letter Factory"" has made me a true believer.Beyond highly recommended - a must have!Update - January 2013: As promised, I also boughtLeapFrog: Talking Words FactoryandLeapfrog: Numberlandas Christmas presents for my oldest boy.

Though, in the ""A"" room, there is a map of the world with Antarctica labeled at the bottom, except it is spelled ""Antartica"".

I couldn't be happier. 1st of all I was really suprised to find that he loved it and wanted to watch the whole thing in one sitting. 2nd, it has helped him emensely with his talking, by teaching him how to make different sounds. 3rd, he can now tell me what sounds the letters ""say"" (just like asking him to tell me what a cat or dog says, he can tell me that the letter ""T"" says ""Ta"" and ""S"" says ""SSSS"")-- and he doesn't even know the alphabet yet. If you're considering this for your child I couldn't reccommend it enough.

They also said don't use flash cards...Well I completely disagree with that article because my son started watching Letter Factory at 16-17 months old.  We go weeks in between viewings sometimes and by 22 months old he knew all of his letters and their sounds.  He is turning 2 in a week and he LOVES playing with the Leap Frog Flash Cards that came in the box set I bought.I know many people have addressed the fact that the video doesn't focus on lower case letters and I do wish there was a little more focus on them.  However, I'm finding it very easy to teach my son the lower case letters on my own, since he knows the upper case letters.I recommend this video to every mom I come across.

Even though I have never pressured my children to read early, my son is now in kindergarten and reading at a second grade level. I attribute part of that to the leap frog dvds because they enjoyed them and were given such a positive impression of reading through them, as well as our family's love of books in general.

Now he is 2 years and 2 weeks old and can recognize EVERY letter in the alphabet AND say the corresponding phonetic sound. I am amazed at how quickly he picked it up. We are a bilingual family (English and Thai/Lao) and  thus far in his life he hasn't been extremely ""verbal"" yet (he walked at 10 months and is great with all the physical stunts, but so far doesn't have a very large vocabulary).I thought this DVD would be something a 2-year-old would need time to ""grow into"", but it has been great for him. It is proven that the mind can recall information more easily when we learn things in a certain context. For example, the ""K"" says ""kuh"", while at the same time doing a ""kick"" and  singing the ""K"" song. All of these cues, visual, audile, and kinesthetic, help seal the information in your child's memory.As a professional English as a Second Language teacher and a Master's Degree holder, I highly recommend this DVD for preschoolers."	5.0	My 2-year-old learned every sound in only 2 weeks!	2006-11-09	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A36Z9O6DKSOIN5	Carla Owens	Cheap and cheerful. My kid was diagnosed with spectrum and has speech delay. I've got this DVD and a few others based on reviews. And Leap Frog DVDs are definitely the best, especially for the money. Among about 7 DVDs I've got, he was asking to put these ones (letters and words) the most. The other day I was amazed that he can pretty much recite the whole video by word. He can't really pronounce some things clearly but but it was obvious that he could remember it all. I was blown away. Also he could write some of the letters. So far I love all Leap Frog videos I have.	5.0	Fantastic	2011-08-30	0	0	0

By the time she was 19 months, you could ask her ""what does (any letter) say?"" and she would make the correct sound.

She sings the little songs that talk about ""B says buh ..."" and that kind of thing even when it isn't on.  And I have noticed she answers me correctly a lot more now when I ask her what sound a letter makes or what the letter is after only seeing the DVD three or four times.  The DVD keeps her attention.  She will watch it all the way through and asks for it.They have catchy ways of introducing the sounds that makes sense and are memorable.  For instance, the S has snakes and the snakes make the sssss sound and they are shaped like S's, too.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because we have had problems with the DVD itself.  The first one we bought had to be returned because it wouldn't play.  The second one has one area that hesitates every time -- I may return that one, too.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A158IVO674QRJ4	Charmaine F. Avery	After reading the great reviews about this product I bought it for my 30 month old grandson. He already knew his alphabets by sight and could tell you each letter as he pointed them out. So I purchased this video to help him learn what sounds each letter makes. He absolutely loves this video he plays it over and over. But when I got it and played it for him I immediately noticed that some of the letter sounds were incorrect most noticable for example the L the O and the R have the incorrect sounds. Despite this, I believe that this DVD is very good for getting toddlers interested in the alphabet and learning their letters. Therefore I can only give it three stars because I think it needs some improvement.	3.0	My 2 yr old grandson loves it,,,, but I am disappointed.	2009-04-19	6	2	4

I also got a couple other alphabet videos to reinforce the same concept in different ways, but this one is by far the best.  The story is very clever and my son watches the entire story intently.  We also have the Fridge Phonics magnet set by Leap Frog, which sings the same tune as on the video, and I love having that toy along with this video.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3C66SACCADS7M	Chicago Mom	This is a great children's learning video. My 2 year old sounds out letters everywhere we go. She's rarely watched more than 1 hour of video in a day(1/2 hour at a time) since I've allowed her to watch videos (6 months old). We do read to her a great deal and talk about the sounds and names of the letters. However, I can say-- without a doubt-- that this video has  been a main component in her excellent knowledge of the alphabet. I don't think it's necessary to play this video daily to be effective. Our daughter watched it a few times a week at most and it made an impact.  She's clearly recognized all of the letters since about 18 months of age and has been able to sound out most of them since 20 or so months. I've recommended this to all of my friends. It's an entertaining video with a catchy tune. You'll catch yourself singing along in no time!	5.0	My 2 YEAR OLD SOUNDS OUT LETTERS EVERYWHERE WE GO!	2005-04-11	0	0	0

He wanted to write words, but he couldn't recall the letter sounds easily.  Then we rented this video from the library, and he seems to have mastered his letter sounds overnight.Additionally, his 3 y/o sibling, who knew his letters but not their sounds, is almost on par with his older brother now.My children really, really enjoy this video--despite the fact that our library copy has multiple scratches and gets ""stuck"" 7-8 times during the story!  I have been impressed with how easily that this video can teach letter sounds, so I went and bought a (unscratched!) copy.  It is worth the investment!Only one negative--some letters have two sounds, like the letter ""c"" or the vowels.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3RI2C0RY4DHK	Chris	"I bought this when my daughter is close to 2 year old. She loves the character especially TAD that it makes her want to do what Tad is doing. Before showing this video, she have an alphabet rubber mat and we were showing her flash cards or letters with animal pictures. She quickly learned the animal sounds but not the letters. When we showed this video to her, she quickly learned the letter sounds in less than a week then she started to recognize all the letters in the alphabet. In two weeks time she only gets confused with E and F and also with l and I but soon realized the difference.We let her play with her 4 year old and 5 year old cousin during one of our family gathering, the game is to go on top of the letter on her rubber mat. My then 2 1/2 year old was able to compete with her cousins sometimes getting to the letter before any of her older cousins does.She also learned how put the letter together using the next video ""Talking Words Factory"". At 3 years old she can now read 3 letter word by putting all the letter sound together but the only thing is that the video only put emphasis on Capital Letters. Her mat is also capital letters and I also write in all CAPS. So she can read the word BAT but not the word bat or Bat. We will now need to show her the lower case equivalent. This will be great if Leap Frog will make this adjustment or make another video with lower case for the next generation of children who will be watching these videos."	5.0	Great Learning Tool for Kids!	2010-07-12	0	0	0

Movies must be of very high educational value and if they do not supplement or reinforce my curriculum's content, they are not used.  I showed this video to my 2-year old, first, and it was EXCELLENT!!!  She loved the characters and was repeating letters and the sounds they make during the first viewing!!!  I am amazed at the high quality of this video.  Leap Frog really took the time to figure out how to get a child's attention, hold it, and teach them in a fun way.  We watch this video at least three times a week as the children are settling on their mats for naptime, and I have heard them singing at different times, ""Every letter makes a sound, the 'a' says a,"" etc.  GREAT VIDEO."	5.0	EXCELLENT FOR TEACHING LETTERS AND THEIR SOUNDS!!	2005-01-15	2	2	0

He was having trouble identifying his letters and his teachers recommended he repeat per-school.  We asked if we could work with him for a couple weeks and one of the things we did was buy this video.  Two weeks later he could identify all 26 letters along with all 26 letter sounds!  His younger sister loved the video also.  They didn't see it as learning, they just thought it was fun.  Two years later my son led his first grade class in Accelerated Reader points.

So we told him he could watch tv either on the way to the baby sitter's house or on the way home--not both.  The baby sitter lives less than 5 minutes from our house.  We put in The Letter Factory so at least he'd be ""learning"" something while he watched in the car.  In less than three weeks, he knew all his letters and sounds from watching this movie.  He is now absolutely obsessed with finding letters everywhere around him, wanting to know what the words say how to spell things.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AOM63D4VL32WM	"Colleen D. Gallagher ""teachingheart net"""	"This is one of the best learning DVD's I have seen. It will be a great watch for the Pre-k to first grade classrooms. The DVD teaches the letter names. Most importantly, it teaches the letter sounds in a creative way. Viewers see the letters, hear the letter names, they see a picture/video that represents the sound each letter makes, and the viewer hears a catchy tune to match the letter sound. For instance, the letter C is shown in a cold environment with ice hanging from it. The letter comes to life by shivering and stating that it is /c/ /c/ /c/.... old. Then the characters in the story sing the catchy Leapfrog song; ""The C says/c/, the C says /c/, every letter makes a sound. The C says /c/. This DVD/VHS is marketed towards parents to use with their PreK to First grader, but all teachers need to know about this video and share it with their class. It would be a great review or introduction to letter sounds. Teachers could also use the catchy phrases and visual representation of the letter sounds in their lessons by creating activities or visuals based on the video. Students will see the sounds letters make, hear the sounds, and sing the sounds. This video combined with strong phonics based classroom instruction will help reach a variety of learning styles and lead your students on the path to becoming strong readers."	5.0	Great for Primary Classrooms too!	2005-01-02	354	244	110

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AYF5TPNXZO4PY	"crys ""crys"""	I want to add my comments to the chorus of other parents who love this DVD.I purchased this for my 16 month old daughter for Christmas.When we went to watch it I was initially disappointed.  It is poorly animated, and has a pretty lame story line.  The characters are predictable and the plot doesn't even make sense at points.But my daughter loved it.I know a 16 month old should not be watching television.  But we let her watch this almost every day to wind down before nap time.In about two weeks, our 17 month old new her alphabet.She could say her alphabet, she could tell you what letters made what sounds.When we would show friends and family how great she was at her alphabet they were shocked, and filled us with compliments about what awesome parents we must be.  Truth be told, be gave all the credit to the movie.It has a lot of repetition, songs and silliness that appeal to toddlers and work towards a learning goal.Now my daughter is three.  She can read small words and is constantly pointing out letters and their sounds, spelling words just for fun, and writing short words, etc.  I think her advanced reading and writing skills at this age are a direct result of her coming to love letters so early.I am actually online looking at this product to order a new one for our 17 month old son.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	ANP5ZZGG9U7KZ	Cugel the Clever	"This video teaches letter recognition and basic letter-sound encoding through the use of mnemonic devices wrapped in a frame story.  In the frame story, frog children explore rooms in a letter factory, where animated versions of each letter are congregated, doing something to reinforce the primary sound for that letter.  For example, the Zs are sleeping, going ""Zzzzzz"".  In each room a short ditty also increases stimulation of the child and is intended to aid recall.I will say that my two-year-old son, after watching it once, demanded to watch it again, and was enthralled.  He also started vocalizing some of the sounds, which for a youngster with a mild expressive language delay is nice to see.  Hence I have to rate it highly in terms of appealing to children on a basic level.However, there is one subpar aspect to this video: it only teaches upper-case letters.  Since it is far better to learn the lower-case letters, this is a mistake on the part of the designers, mirrored in other products such as theLeapFrog Fridge Phonics Magnetic Alphabet Set, which only comes with a set of upper-case letters, forcing one to buy the lower-case letters as an add-on set.  There is a brief mention, several seconds long, of the existence of the lower-case letters, and the letter B is briefly shown then in lower case, but aside from that, it's all upper case.(All leading pre-reading programs today primarily stress recognition of the lower-case letters, and secondarily the upper case letters, for a number of reasons.  Since lower-case b-d and p-q reversals are common in early writing, getting practice in differentiating them early can help greatly.  In addition, the vast majority of text a young child will learn to read is in lower case.)All in all we found this video charming, memorable and well-constructed, with the glaring flaw of a nearly exclusive focus on the upper-case alphabet.  If it is used, it must be accompanied by plenty of other material which stresses the lower-case alphabet; and the fact that the lower-case alphabet is not taught by this video represents a huge missed chance."	3.0	Catchy, but only stresses upper case letters	2012-01-11	3	3	0

Simultaneously engages all learning styles: Audio, visual, and kinesthetic. After a few weeks of enjoying this video, my 28-month-old identifies each letter of the alphabet and tells me the sound each letter makes! The results have AMAZED me.

He just turned 4 and in preschool, but I am certain he is now ahead of most kids in my daughters kindergarten class and they are over halfway through the year.The weird thing is he LOVES watching it and playing the simple game at the end using the remote.  I watch him as he mouths the sounds as the letters come up.The only downside is that we as adults have to hear it.  The simple songs are eerily addicting and almost impossible to remove from your head after only a couple viewings. My wife and I laugh about it and when we notice the other looking content and peaceful, all the other has to do is sneak up and sing ""The B says ""buh"""".  Its good for a laugh but sort of mean because it take a few hours to forget it again.  I'd almost rather have 6 hours of hiccups.As for my son, he could have worse songs stuck in his brain so I'm sure he'll be OK.

We are always trying to make most TV time educational.  I was astonished to see that this became his favorite DVD instantly and within a few weeks of watching regularly he could tell me what sounds all of the letters made.  It was amazing to me.  We have since bought the next few Leap DVD's in this series and my son (three now) is sounding out words on his own, and loving it. Sure, he isn't always able to put the individual sounds together and figure out the word, but most three letter words are read easily and correctly.My younger son and one of my neices, both two years old, know all the letters by name, the sounds they make, and which are vowels. Don't be mislead by other reviews of leap movies that say the animation is low end.

But....we have several other Leap Frog items and our daughter loves them.  So, I bought this DVD for our Daughter for her second birthday.  After the first viewing, my daughter was running through the house pointing and calling out letters.  During the second viewing, she was calling out the next letter in the alphabet as each letter was being shown.I have only two concerns:--  Only one sound is taught for letters like C, A, O, E, G etc...a little confusing, but I can deal.--How to convince family and friends that kids really ENJOY watching this even though it could be perceived as 'flashcardy'.This is a 'must buy' for toddlers and preschoolers!

In another clip, the professor was tasting popcorn and commented that it needed salt. As a result, in a later scene, the student frog mentioned salt, obviously having learned ""salt"" is a treat.

And when reading the reader rabbit reviews I bumped into one review that mentioned this one. I then happened to see the RR one too. I am so glad we got this. The story is great, it is not boring. The amount of time they spend talking about each letter is just right for a kid not to loose interest. My son (wich was just turned 5 when we got it) just loved this and better than all he mastered his letter sounds in no time! Even my 21 mos old loves this. She asks to watch the frog all the time and she recognizes some letters and some sounds thanks to this. She saw letter F the other day and said the name F with a blow. It is amazing. After thsi my son asked to get the talking words factory. We got it too and it was excelent help for him to learn word families. I posted a comment on that. I recommend this DVD. It made phonics and reading so much easier to my son. We are now getting the word capers with is the third in the sequence to help our son in more complexes sounds as SH, CH and to understand some rules such as a vowel silencing another etc. So far we have loved this series and would buy again.

He congratulates all the new letters for making their perfect sound..In this way they learn all the sounds of the letters in a fun and creative way that will be remembered by all.A+  Thank you Leap Frog	5.0	Excellent and Fun!!!	2006-11-09	1	1	0

They can be exposed to it early, like age 1. After that the repetition is good because they pick up different things at different ages. My almost 4-year-old is paying attention now to which words begin with each sound. EXCELLENT EXCELLENT video.

Not only did my son love watching it, which surprised me as it wasn't anything that spectacular, but he also learned very quickly. This was one of the ones he wanted to watch over and over again. I never had to push him to watch it, he pushed me. Age 3 and half and he knew his phonetics. Amazing. I am still impressed now that he is four and knows the sound that every letter makes. His expensive pre-school couldn't even do this well. Now I am looking for something with letter combinations and words. He just watched Super Why on PBS and this seems like it might be next. I will also check out the other Letter Factory videos although we purcahsed another one or two and they didn't work nearly as well. Maybe we didn't get the right one.

The panting H with tounge hanging out, The I that gets slimed and the lollypop licking L.

I am not talking drill and kill, I simply mean that just like we talk to our kids about anything in this world, it is also important to talk to your kids about letters, sounds and words. That said, I have never recommended videos for children in my class to improve their letters/word knowledge. My own children (2 years old) have an expressive speech delay, so in my mind it is even MORE important to expose my children early to letters/sounds in a fun way. On the recommendation of our speech therapist we bought this same video and my boys LOVE it. Not only do they love it, but I learned a new song that we sing when we are out and about learning about letters and sounds in the real environment. My barely (July) 2 year old boys know the majority of letters/sounds by name and we are rapidly learning the letters/sounds by sight.I HIGHLY recommend this video to all and especially for parents to watch WITH their children and learn the REAL sounds letters make. Then take this knowledge/sounds from the song to continue the teaching throughout the day!!Maybe all children seem to level out by 3rd grade, but what parent would want their child to be the ""low"" kid in the K-2 class??!!  In my classroom the children who come in September knowing few letters struggle ALL YEAR long to catch up to their peers.

Even though this video is obviously geared toward the very young (2-5) first learning their letters, it is also watchable by adults.One of my friends recommended I try ""Letter Factory"" as an educational video for my son when he is ready to start learning his alphabet (my son in currently 18 mos.) I've only watched the show once with my son, just to see how it was, and actually enjoyed it. I had previously watched other shows geared toward young children and found that they tended to focus on entertaining the young ones and alienating any adult audience. Even though these shows are for my son, I do want to be able to sit and watch it with him rather than just putting him in front of the TV, and this show seems to meet my desires. The light humor makes ""Letter Factory"" watchable by all ages, and while the repetition of the songs get a little tiring after a  while for me, the repetition of the letters and their sounds is what other parents have said helps their children learn the alphabet."	5.0	Educational & Fun	2010-08-24	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AJKEU8082EH0S	E.L.	My 2 year old son received this video for Christmas and is completely obsessed with it. For his birthday, in November, he had gotten another phonics toy--the Zizzle Letters and Sound Talking Smart Stick--and it was way over his head. He didn't know any letter names or sounds, and couldn't play the games, so he lost interest in that toy pretty quickly. However, after watching this video daily for a week or two he could identify nearly all the letters and their sounds. He also now plays with his Zizzle phonics toy, which is now nearly too easy for him. I think the heart of what makes this video work so well is repetition (with the simple letter song) and visual reinforcement (the letters are depicted in ways that reinforce their sound). It's very entertaining for my son, and he'd watch it all day if I'd let him. I would highly recommend this video to any parent.	5.0	Great Learning Tool	2009-02-18	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2RYY7YJAT5OZ8	European Book Treasurer	"My 2,5 year old daughter started watching LETTER FACTORY about a month ago. One month later, she knows all the letters of the alphabet, from A to Z and she knows their sounds. Last week we started learning how to write them!Its fun. As Tad and Professor cruise the factory they go into different rooms where letters learn their sounds. Letter A says ""Aaaa"", professor walks in dressed like a monsters and all letters and Tad shout ""Aaa"". The song follows ""the A says Aaa, the A says Aaa. Every letter makes a sound, the A says Aaa"". Letter P is like Popcorn, T is a tap dancer, etc. etc. till the Z which likes to sleep.Excellent idea how to teach 2 year old letters!

Also, it kinda bugged me that Leap lied to his brother Tad about losing his voice, so Tad could do the presentation.  Does that show that it's okay to 'white lie'?

He then revisited the phonics library (which has 6 or 7 different settings: press the letter and hear the letter's name; child is asked to find the letter with the sound ""buh"" and when child is correct, child is praised; spell the word.and so forth..) none of this captured my child's attention until after we watched the Letter Factory, these toys were revisited and (with reinforcement from me doing some of the activities suggested in the included pamphlet, such as tracing the letters and physically acting out the letters) it seemed then that it all came together for my child. In this dvd, all the letters of the alphabet are shown with their corresponding sounds. There is a distinction made between: ""Capital letters and lower-case letters.""

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2OYUSALNS3WIZ	Frank Lisa Woody	"My kids LOVE the Leap Frog videos and they've been helpful in teaching them about phonics, math and other topics. A small criticism, though, is that some of the phonics sounds are confusing them. The ""O' doesn't say, ""Ahhhhh"" like the video voiceover says. My four and five year olds said, ""Mom, that's not right."" And the sounds for letters such as L, D and R come out like ""El,"" ""Duh,"" and ""Er,"" which confused my 4 year old when he tried to read the written word. He kept saying, ""ellot,"" duh-og,"" and ""errun"" instead of ""lot,"" ""dog"" and ""run.""For learning phonics and reading the written word, I prefer a teaching method that teaches sounds, not letters. Kids who come out of preschool know their letters. But then they have to learn everything all over again (sometimes with multiple sounds) when it comes time to learn phonics and begin reading. That being said, it's helpful to have the memorable songs that my kids love, and when my kids get stuck on a sound, I often prompt them with, ""Every letter makes a sound, the f says ....?"" And they come up with the right answer!"	4.0	Memorable & Entertaining; One Minor Criticism	2012-06-14	0	0	0

Both use the same ""The Farmer in the Dell""  melody to teach kids what each letter ""says"".  I just wish the ridable Leap Frog School Bus also had this same theme song.  My other minor nit-pick (are you listening Leap Frog?!) is when the Mother Frog sings her 2 lines at the beginning of the video.  It is awful, completely out of place and makes my wife and me cringe whenever we hear it! All-in-all, this video has a cute story and does a nice job of teaching letters with phonics.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1I9V9NJ98ZO7L	Gym lady	The creators of this program have come up with an excellent concept; animating letters that make sounds representing each letter in the Alphabet.  I have a degree in Psychology and studied several modules on how children learn to read.  I also have 2 preteen children who I taught to read and one 4 year old daughter who I bought this learning video for.  The four year old learnt all the sounds pretty quickly.  However, there are a few letters pronounced incorrectly; L is pronounced ULL, R is pronounced ER and a few others are not clear.But by far the BIGGEST problem with this video is that all the letters are only taught in UPPER CASE letters.  So your lovely child may learn all her sounds but most books for children are written in lower case letters, with CAPS only at the beginning of sentences and names.  Some parents may not see this as a problem because we take for granted that our experienced minds can easily switch between reading lower and upper case letters, but from the numourous case studies I did to complete my modules, plus from my own experience with my children, most childhood educators recommend teaching lower case letters first, then very early introduction of upper case letters. 98% of all prose in all books is written in lower case!  Imagine a 4 year old learning the letter 'A', then in a simple book you expect them to identify the 'a' in printed text then link the two objects as being the same?! To their young eyes its a completely different object and you will have to reteach them from scratch as I have had to do with my 4 year old.However, buying this video is still recommended though, but what I have done to help my child is to have a book with colourful lower case letters close by to show her everytime the capital letter is shown on the video.  This same problem of CAPS only is on the entire Leapfrog series, I have 4 of their DVDs.

We used preschool prep co for the basics: letters, number, colors, shapes, and I thought it was time to introduce phonics. She's been watching this video for a week and she isn't repeating any of the sounds yet, but at least she's interested. If she watches it enough she'll get it.	5.0	Something my 3 year old asks to watch!	2011-01-18	0	0	0

I was seriously considering keeping him out of kindergarten an extra year, when my sister, a kindergarten teacher, recommended this DVD.  Every day we would pop popcorn and sit down to watch this fun little show.  We hadn't even been doing this two weeks and my son had every letter and their corresponding sounds learned perfectly.  In addition, my 2 year old, who watched the DVD with us learned most of the letters and/or sounds as well - which has greatly impressed many of the relatives :). The show is fun and engaging, the characters are cute and friendly and it is the only show like this that has kept my sons attention.

The best part is she does so happily, so it's not coerced learning.

I like the introduction of each letter, and the repetition of the little song for each letter is good for young ones (it's the same thing that's on a lot of the Leap Frog toys).  But I always skip over the introduction.  It's really drawn out, and kind of over-the-top with it's pro-capitalism.  Why do they have to have this factory where some big rich duck is going to come see a presentation to decide whether or not to buy these letters?  And why do they have to say things that I think are borderline racist like: ""our letters are the best letters in the world!"".  I guess once my son gets older I'll have to explain to him the capitalist/xenophobic ramifications of this video he loves so dearly."	4.0	Capitalist Letters	2007-04-23	9	1	8

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2L4AH95G5VSZH	Heather J. Wilkinson	I suspect that a lot of the parents who gave this video a good review did not watch ALL of it with their child. The video is visually entertaining and fun, but the spoken part needs to be redone.  It simply is incorrect about how to pronounce some of the letters.  L shouldn`t be pronounced ``Uhl`` but they say it that way over and over, and the R shouldn`t be said ``er`` and so on.  Also, in every case, only the short vowel sounds are taught, A as in apple, not A as in ate. When I taught phonics, we told kids that every vowel says its name, plus another sound.  It isn`t hard to teach that, and it is really important.  Worst of all, few examples are given of how the letters actually sound in words.  For example, they show us a letter M saying ``m m`` but they don`t bother to say a single M word.  My 3 year old loves watching the video and playing the little game that comes with it, but I wish it were better.	3.0	Contains errors!  Needs improvement.	2008-10-10	10	5	5
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1YA3E4GH0QDCQ	"Heather ""Mom of 2 Amazing boys"""	My son 3 1/2 and my 21 month old son quickly began making all the letter sounds.  After just 3 times of watching the video, my son new 15 of the letters and their sounds.  He actually doesn't even sit and watch it, but plays and repeats the sounds as he plays.  He's often not even in view of the TV so I think he'd get even more if he saw the helpful graphics that go with it, but I'm not going to make him stare at the TV.I am annoyed with a couple of things on this video.  The most important being that some of the letter sounds are completely incorrect, but I've been loudly singing them correctly over the video so he isn't learning it wrong.  For example the video says that R says 'er' instead of 'rrrr'.  Also that L says 'ul' which is completely wrong.  There are a few other incorrect ones as well.My other annoyance is that only on letter B, J, and I do they ever address the lower case letter.  All the letters that are saying their sounds are capitals.  The lower case is shown for only a split second and not explained at all.  That's a huge error since kids are reading with lower cases much more often than seeing capitals.Overall, it's been a good introduction.  It seems that of the videos out there this one is interesting to the kids and fun for them, but has some major mistakes.  The others I've seen are boring but teach more correctly.  Tough decision.	3.0	He learned fast, but no lower case and there are some mistakes	2009-03-01	21	15	6

Within 2-3 weeks of watching the video (not everyday, but frequently) he pretty much knew the entire alphabet! I like it because it ties in with other Leap Frog toys. ie, the Fridge ABC magnets. The consistency and repetition helps a child learn very quickly. After they have mastered the alphabet, you can move them on to the Talking Words Factory video.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A200554RPDX882	H. Hess	I would not normally write about my son but we feel like we have been given a present in this video.  We have lots of videos and toys that deal with the alphabet but none have captured the attention of my sone who has an autistic spectrum disorder.  He really does not like TV and does not play with toys.  We have lots of Leap Frog toys - and he does not play with them.But, this video is really teaching him his ABC's and he asks to watch it over and over.  I sometimes hear him singing during the day the letter tunes.  If you heard one leap frog tune well you know what they sound like ( A says A, A says A, every letter makes a sound, A says A).  However, the visual cues that the video puts with the letters is awesome.  When we read other letter books at night he feel he has to say the sounds from this video.BONUS:  the game on the DVD is so great.  The child is asked to find the letter that makes a certain sound.  If your child gets it wrong, it prompts again and if he/she gets it wrong again, it will show a little clip of the video as a visual reminder.  he loves this game and is actually learning his letters.I highly recommend this for any child.	5.0	Such a blessing for my son who has ASD	2005-11-02	2	2	0

It's amazing! By the third time he watched it, he was able to recognize letters I wrote on his magnadoodle.To the previous posters, I think that the letters you feel are pronounced incorrectly, is a mere dialect difference.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2F42D89Z2TH3S	IJ'sMommy	"This DVD was first introduced to my child at his daycare. I went ahead and purchased it and two weeks later he could say about 10 - 12 of the letter sounds if you prompted him with the little song that is sung in the story.... ""The A says..."" and then he'll say Ahh! We let him watch the DVD about 2 to 3 times a week and 4 to 5 weeks later, he can now say 20 of his letter sounds. We started to play the DVD when he was 16 months and now he is 17 months old. I would definitely recommend this DVD to any parent. And it seems like even for a one-year old, it isn't too early to start! Who knew a one-year-old could recite letter sounds?I'm so glad we found this DVD. I plan on purchasing the Word Factory DVD later on, maybe around age two and see how that goes. I'm truly amazed by this product. For $10, my child learned the majority of his letter sounds in a month, but after almost a year of watching the My Baby Can Read series.... nothing! Okay, maybe not nothing... he learned to follow the direction ""arms up"" and ""arms down"" from that DVD, but he certainly wasn't reading after watching the series since the age of 3 months. No big surprise to me that the company went under. It made false claims. This DVD by the Letter Factory is FAR FAR cheaper than the $200 My Baby Can Read Series and makes no claims about what your child will learn, and yet review after review, we can clearly tell that the Letter Factory DVD works, and it works quickly.As a former Pre-K teacher, I will have to agree with the other review about the DVD having errors. It does say that the L says ""ull"" and the R says ""err"" which is incorrect. And it makes me cringe every time I hear the Letter L singing it's ""Uuullll"" song.... because I don't want my child to think that the Letter L says ""ULL"" but I've been reviewing and repeating the correct letter sounds with him for the letter L and the letter R and he seems to adjust accordingly.Anyway, hands down this is a great product and worth every penny."	5.0	Great DVD for learning letter sounds! - Even for One-Year-Olds	2012-08-11	0	0	0

There is just something catchy enough that after just a few days it really seems to click.  Although I am NOT a proponent of much TV/video watching for pre-schoolers (I actually think any TV/video watching before the age of two could/should be considered abusive or negligent) this video is almost magical for helping children learn letters and sounds."	5.0	wonderful video	2008-03-26	1	1	0

The DVD introduces toddlers to the alphabet in an extremely engaging format using the Leap, Lily and Tad froggie characters. My daughter is only 2 and has been watching the DVDs (again and again and again....by request) for a month and can identify every letter of the alphabet and can tell what sound each letter makes. An added benefit is an expansion of your toddler's vocabulary in addition to learning the letters in the alphabet. Of all the developmental and educational toys and DVDs I have bought, this one is by far the best investment. I am buying one for every kid we know who is about to turn 2!	5.0	Would Give 10-Stars If I Could!!!	2007-03-27	2	2	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AQNDWV4YMTBZF	Ivanca	Admitedly, my 29 month old daughter is a ball of energy, but she absolutely loves anything to do with the alphabet, so I thought she'd love this dvd.  She was so bored with it that she kept coming over to me during the show and requesting other videos that she has.  She just did not get into this.  I think maybe because it's cartoon format.  Cartoons don't hold her interest unless they are interactive (asking the audience questions, etc.)  Otherwise, she prefers live people, puppets, etc.  But there was no opportunity for her to interact with this cartoon, so it didn't hold her attention.  Maybe she'll like it more when she gets older.  I have to admit though, I was a little disappointed and thought it was kind of boring too.	3.0	Bored toddler here	2006-02-03	10	4	6

He is already trying to sound out words when we are reading together and will point out letters and say their corresponding sound/a word that starts with that letter almost any time he sees a letter. Great educational video that is very entertaining for children/parents alike!

She is already picking out letters in books, especially the vowels.The video systematically goes through each letter, showing fun scenes within the letter factory. Each letter has its own room where they learn what sound it makes. The frog goes on a tour through the factory learning the sound of each letter with the letters. They sing a song ""The A says 'ah' the A says 'ah'; every letter letter makes a sound; the A says 'a'."" This song is repeated in each room, sung over while showing the letters. In addition to showing animated letters, each letter is shown written on a door, written on a blackboard, and usually written on other items. For each letter examples are given of words that start with that letter. After about 3 or 4 letters are introduced, they are reviewed.The video manages to hold my daughter's attention throughout the entire thing.With some parental involvement, reinforcement, and review, this is an excellent resource for introducing your child to the alphabet (upper and lower case) and their basic sounds."	5.0	Excellent Intro to the Alphabet	2009-12-10	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2TH2DZ58Z4SJ5	Jacqueline	"An elementary school teacher recommended this DVD to me for my four-year-old son.  I must say that this has  helped my son tremendously in learning his letters and the letter sounds.  The animated frog characters sing songs about each letter and demonstrate a way to remember the sound by associating it with a funny action and a catchy tune.  For instance, the ""A"" is easily frightened so he screams, ""Aaaaaa""  every time something scares him.  The ""B"" likes classical music and sings the tune of Beethoven's 5th symphony, ""ba-ba-ba-baaaa.""  The ""C"" is always, ""c-c-c-cold.""My son has watched his ""Letter Factory"" DVD nearly every day for the past two weeks since we bought it and I can honestly say that he now knows every letter and its sound.  The method works and I highly recommend it for your child."	5.0	It really works	2009-06-03	1	1	0

She cracked up at some parts and she was constantly repeating lines from the video. She knew all of her letters within a week of watching this video (she's one of those kids that wants to watch it 10 times a day...or at least have it on while she is playing)! We started about a year ago with it and don't really use it anymore because she knows her letters so well now, but she still says ""Wu Wu Wu Wu What's happening dude?"" EVERY time she sees a W! It definately helped lay a solid foundation for her. Now she is 3 and reading about 100 words. This video is worth every penny and then some, but don't expect it to do all the teaching for you!

After just two weeks of watching this DVD daily, she knows and recognizes the entire alphabet, knows the hard sound for each letter and can figure out the first letter of a word by herself.  It has bridged the gap between what I wanted her to learn before Kindergarten and what she was willing to put up with.  She is now beginning to sound words out on her own and we are moving on to the Word Factory DVD.  I Highly recommend this DVD!!

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	ANLZDQ6525AD4	jaknrak	"This is the first review I've ever written for Amazon, but I had to let other parents know about this fantastic DVD.  We've had it for about 3 weeks and already my 3 year old not only knows all the letters (lowercase and uppercase) by sight and sound, but she can also WRITE them (capitals only).  Now, where ever we go, she says, ""Look mommy, letters!""  And she tells me their names and sounds.  She's also picking up books and sounding out the letters she sees. Almost all of these milestones happened since we have had this DVD.  I normally prefer to teach her myself, but in this case, the Letter Factory DVD has been able to teach her in 3 weeks what I've been trying to teach her for the last 3 months.  Even my 17 month old child repeats the letter sounds and can recognize a few letters when she sees them (she gives their sound).We also have the Talking Words Factory DVD which builds upon the Letter Factory.  It introduces simple words and letter blends.  Although the topic of letter blends seems to be a little incomplete, this video still does a great job of teaching phonics to build words.  We've only seen it a couple of times but my 3 year old already is noticing word blends and sounds them out.  I just can't say enough good things about these products. I HIGHLY recommend them to any parent who wants to teach their child letters and phonics."	5.0	Teaches letters and phonics fast!	2006-06-22	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3UV7L5ND3EH8T	"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C..."	"My son was diagnosed with Pervasive Development Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified when he was 3. PDD-NOS is on the Autism spectrum, and children with this diagnosis often have developmental delays.My son had a speech delay and other developmental delays. His speech is great now...no one can detect that he has this diagnosis. However, the delays have, understandably, affected his learning in some areas.While his spatial skills have been way above average--as has his grasp of science (such as planets and their attributes)--he has resisted reading. He gets tired and frustrated.Well, trying many approaches for helping him, I thought I'd take a chance and get Letter Factory from Amazon.com, especially since the reviews were so good.I am so THRILLED that I did! I thought for SURE he'd suspect that I was ""getting him to learn"" (make no mistake, PDD-NOS doesn't mean a low IQ!), but surprisingly, he's been watching Letter Factory on a consistent basis for WEEKS now! I'll even hear him singing the catchy songs to himself as he goes about his business.In the DVD, Tad (Leap's younger brother) joins Professor Quigley to all the different rooms where new letters learn their sounds. For example, when they enter the A room, there's a silly purpose monster that scares the little A's into saying ""ahhhh!"" In the K room, the little K's are practicing their karate kicks as they learn how to make the ""kay"" sound.What's especially great about the Letter Factory is that it combines the visuals of the letters with the sound that the letter makes in a very catchy tune. For example, as the F's are flying, they sing ""the F says 'eff', the F says 'eff'...every letter makes a sound, the F says 'eff'"". This method helps both audio and visual learners to grasp the sounds...not to mention those that are more musically inclined.I see my son applying what he's learned (very quickly, I might add!) to books. He'll now pick up books from the library ON HIS OWN, and attempt to sound out the words. Combined with the DVD's Talking Words Factory I and Learn to Read at the Storybook Factory, I KNOW The Letter Factory has contributed to his progress in a BIG way.Highly recommended!"	5.0	Fantastic DVD!	2006-01-28	111	76	35

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	I've never been this exciting about a children's video. This one is truly a gem. The video teaches your child the letter sounds in a fun, captivating way. The video really isolates the letter sounds so your child learns the sound and not just a word associated with the sound. Not only that, but your child will learn to say the letter sounds with CONFIDENCE.The cartoon is enjoyable to watch, and is not annoying to parents as background noise like some other videos. It's a decent length and keeps my 4 year old son attention for the whole time; which allows me to get things done around the house.It's amazing and the learning is SO easy. Leapfrog definitely has a winner here! On a personal note, since watching the video (more than once of course), my son learned all his letter sounds and coupled with the Talking Words Factory is now sounding out words. This is a wonderful learning tool for any child!	5.0	It's worth every penny!	2006-01-27	1	1	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3K1LLV4G8F75Y	Jenny Loving	I was a first grade teacher before my son was born, so I have a pretty good handle on teaching letter sounds, etc. I'm all about having children learn from many different angles, so thought this video would be a great addition to our learning routine. Actually, we hadn't really done much with the alphabet when we got this (at around 20 months), so this was his first introduction to the alphabet other than singing the alphabet song and a few flash card sessions.Much to my surprise, within a few times of viewing this video my son was able to say all his letter sounds. After around 2 months of off and on viewing, he can now say all of the letter sounds just by seeing the letter. What's more impressive is that he can do this out of order, and he is beginning to decode words using the sounds! This is something that many kindergartners are just learning.Of course, I think my son is brilliant (lol! Doesn't every mom?) but I'm more than happy to announce that this video is extremely well done, and I don't think that my son would be as far along without it, despite my teaching background.When you use this video (and the others in the series, which we will start in on shortly) in conjunction with flash cards, teachable moments around the home/outside the home, etc...your child will be well prepared for school.Go leapfrog!	5.0	22 Month Old Now Knows Letters And Sounds By Sight	2009-06-26	1	1	0

To make it work, I am totally skipping the intro and boring part, enter scene selection and starts playing at &#34;Aa!&#34; and voila! it works!

Little did I know how much she would love this video (it did take a few times for her to get into this DVD however). She requests for this DVD and I gladly put it on b/c I hear her sing the sounds of the letters as she dances to the music. It's a joy watching her learn.

He knew majority of them by sight and some of their sounds. I just couldn't keep his interest no matter what tactics I used. Magnets,books,Alphie,nothing seemed to truly click. I decided to give this video a try. Best decision I have made in the past month. Within 3 days,he knew all his letters. I suspect he knew them all before but was just being a little difficult. But now,he was excited about them,something I couldn't accomplish. Within a week he knew all the sounds. He now quizzes us to see if we know everything he does. Like I said he is really excited about his letters. He also surprised us by perfectly drawing(as perfectly as a 3 yr old can) several letters on his dry erase board on his own.

I got it for my 3yr old for his birthday.  We had been in the process of SLOWLY learning his letters.  After 2weeks from the video he knew all of them, both uppercase and lowercase, and knows what sound each makes.  Most importanly he Loves letters now.  He sings the 'every letter makes a sound' song with his friend when they play together.  He makes my husband and I sing it too him so he can say the sound at the end.  It's really great.  I have been able to teach him to sound out 3 and 4 letter words.  He is barely 3, and already reading!

I then quizzed our son in front of his Daddy so that he could witness what I just had.  Sure enough, he was amazed at what he had learned without us working with him yet!!

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	ADUHDNN5MS4KR	Joe	"We bought this DVD for a 12 hour (one way) car trip for our just-turned-2 year old. She watched it a half dozen times on the way down and 3 times on the way back then switched to ""Word Factory."" When we got home she requested and watched it at least once per day for a week or so. She doesn't watch alot of TV but the TV she does watch we try to make it educational. Anyway...back home after the holidays she went to her ""school"" and blew all the teachers away by the fact that she knew not only all her letters (which we had been working on for awhile) but also the way the letters SOUNDED - ""The B says Buh!"". In fact, the teachers brought her up to the Director's office and showed off her abilities. Imagine how proud the parents are when they hear a story like this - it made our day. Around the house we sing the song ""Every letter makes a sound the H says..."" and she responds with the proper sound...amazing how quickly kids are able to soak information in especially when it is presented in such an entertaining and easy to digest manner. Hat's off to Leap Frog - I just purchased the other DVDs in this series to have on-hand when she is ready."	5.0	Not that this needs another high rating but...	2006-01-12	1	1	0

He knew more than friends who were over a year older than him.  However, we lost the first video (or lended it out??) and so I purchased another.  This was advertised as a 2-disc 50th anniversary edition.  Sounded great!  But that is not what I received.  It was just the basic DVD.  I was bummed, but will keep it.**EDITED TO ADD: After talking with Amazon they offered to replace the item.  We already used it, so I did not do that, but they refunded me $5 for the error.

After only owning it for 10 days, My son can recognize nearly every letter of the alphabet, and knows the sounds that half the letters make. He just adores this video and asks for it repeatedly - which is great, because it's educational! The song is very catchy if corny, but we sing it in the car all the time.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A6FM3ZJR2MMHA	JRK	My 3 year old daughter, her 4 and 8 year old cousins absolutely love this DVD. She has memorized the whole movie because of how catchy it is. It makes it fun for kids because every letter is used as a jingle. Even when it's off, she is singing about letters and the sound they make. I also bought the Numberland DVD and a few others but this has been the one all the kids ask for. The way i starts is with a family of turtles going on a family trip to see the family owned letter factory. It has a happy mood all the way through and keeps children is somewhat of a trance. Very creative way of making kids learn letters and the sounds they make by making it fun and musical. The best movie I have bought for her so far. I never thought I would see the day that my daughter would choose an educational movie over Dora, spongebob and other shows. I've watched all the other Leapfrog movies with her recently because Netflix carries them and this is by far the best.	5.0	My 3 year old loves Letter Factory	2013-09-02	0	0	0

The visual graphics are horrible, like 1980's cartoon quality. My kids make it through the first 5 minutes and are begging to shut it off. They enjoy the leapfrog toys, but if you are going to show your kids a DVD to teach them letters or sounds I think preschool prep is better (graphics suck but it gets to the point and the information sticks!) and the your baby can read series. Both of my kids watched these along with the Blues Clues shape detectives, at 2 years they could identify all letters, shapes, colors and numbers. At 3 my son could read anything and everything.	1.0	Terrible graphics	2013-01-17	4	1	3
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3ISKIODPTHFP9	J. Smith	We originally bought this as a Christmas present.  At first my daughter showed no interest in it.  Now, at just under 3 1/2 years old, she asks to watch it at least once a day. She became very interested in the DVD once her long term memory improved and she was able to remember what different letters looked like.  It has accelerated her letter recognition and really helped her recognize some letters that look and sound the same (B,P,D,etc...).  Now when she recognizes a letter she say its name and sings the song with the correct pronunciation from the DVD. All this with about two weeks of exposure to the DVD.As a parent I really like how this DVD, My First LeapPad: Alphabet book and the Letter Factory Game all reinforce the same idea. She gets the repetition in different formates.  I highly recommend these products.	5.0	Excellent for learning letters and their sounds	2007-07-03	0	0	0

However, it only does one sound per letter, no long and short vowel sounds, just the short and one G sound for examples.  For the letter A, a furry monster scares a room full of A's and they scream Aaaaaaa! to illustrate the A sound.  My son learned the sound quickly and happily.

After about 1 week of watching this every day, she has learned all of the sounds that each letter makes, and we have moved on to the Talking Words Factory.

By her second birthday, my daughter could identify and name almost all 26 letters and sounds.  I suggest using this DVD accompanied with the Fridge Phonics Magnetic Set.  I would have loved to use these tools at the beginning of the year when I was teaching first grade for the kids that still didn't know all the letters/sounds.

If your Child loves to watch TV I am sure this would be a useful tool for you. My daughter loves to sing the little song for the letters everywhere we go and that to me is important as it shows me her understanding is visable away from the TV.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A234HXDATOAYEY	"Karen Baker ""city mama"""	"My 26 month old son loves watching this, and it really does what it's meant to do.  I bought Melissa and Doug magnetic fridge letters at the same time, and he almost immediately began naming letters using the sounds he learned in the video.  Every week there are a couple more letters he recognizes.  He points to the A and says AAAAH!  He takes the J out of his name puzzle and says 'jump, jump!' and makes it jump around.  When he sees and S, he hisses like a snake.  And every time he sees a circle, he says ""o!""  It really works!  Not that I think a 2 year old needs to be pushed in any way, but my older children were early readers, and I figured I'd try it and see if he was interested.  Kids are always eager for new ways to make sense of their world, and what better gift to give them than the keys to reading?  This video is a fun, well-crafted way to introduce these foundational concepts.  I'm looking forward to using the word factory video in a year or so.  And I wish Leap Frog could work this same magic for potty training, but that's a different story :)As far as the criticism about only upper case letters-- it's true, but you do have to start somewhere, and phonics newbies need to first grasp the letter-sound correspondence before the next steps are relevant.  The video does briefly touch on the idea that there are small letters that have the same sound.  And in my past experience, small letters are so much part of the child's environment that once they are engaged with their own emerging phonics skills and asking a million questions about the books and other print they see, this problem sorts itself out organically.Highly recommended for any pre-reading child, two and up."	5.0	One more 5 star review!	2010-10-14	1	1	0

Before i bought this he thought the letter ""A"" was the number 4 (I'm serious!!!) In about 1 week he knew over 2/3 the alpabete. After 1 month he knows all the leters and the majority of the sounds. He points out letters on the road and says the name and the sound. My brother LOVES this video and he is very picky about what he watches.The songs are catchy but can get annoying. it goes: ""A say AH. A says AH. Every letter makes a sound and A says AH."" For every letter. It only makes 1 sound for each letter, but i wish they said both sounds for them.I HIGHLY recomend this along with the ""Leap Frog Fridge Phonics Magnetic Letter Play Set."""	5.0	AMAZING PRODUCT	2007-03-03	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3FCQU46DQ5X9N	K. Arrington	My 3 1/2 year old son was having trouble with letter recognition and sounds although he could say his A-B-Cs.  A friend of mine recommended this and it is fantastic!  The letters are all presented in a catchy way with a neat tune and it is fun to watch.  He asks to watch it every day and after only 3 weeks can recognize about 90% of the alphabet, tell me what sound each letter makes and a word that begins with that letter!	5.0	This is a wonderful video	2006-03-23	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1KSO77EVG6IM4	karyneliz	I read the many positive reviews and thought, might as well give it a try.  My 23 month old at the time sat down and watched the whole thing through and requested it again the following week.  He has watched it maybe 6 times through and after only 3 times he was sounding out letters of the alphabet on his own.  He LOVES LOVES LOVES LOVES letters now and wherever we are if he sees letters he must stop, touch them and read them out.  He knows the difference between upper and lower case and knows them to be the same letter, he knows the sounds they make and knows an object or a person whose name starts with that letter.  I am thoroughly impressed not only with this DVD, but the others in the set of 3 that I purchased.  I intend to buy others that leapfrog has created.  Well worth the money.  Works great on its own or with other tools, such as flashcards, toys with alphabet, magnetic letters on the fridge.  It all helped and I amazed how quickly my son learned the alphabet.  He knows shapes and colours already now by spending time with him on this and now we will move on to numbers!	5.0	Wow...he knows the alphabet!	2012-06-11	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AVROG6GWRF6V6	Kat03g	This DVD is an excellent investment for your child and his/her future!My child had a delay upon entering preschool and was very frustrated, I bought this video in hopes that it would help and it definatley did! Not only was our child able to learn letters and their sounds, but now our child is advanced beyond others in the same age group! No one would ever think that our child had a delay upon entering preschool! This video made learning easy and fun! We also purchased the other Leap Frog videos to continue the progress! Our child is now 3 years old and easily making waves through preschool! An excellent source of knowledge development! Children soak up information in the first 5 years of age, so I would highly reccommend this video for all!	5.0	Letter Factoy	2009-12-26	1	1	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2T2UGL3N7NLLN	Kate_A	"I think this is a great dvd for learning alphabet recognition and the sounds each letter makes. The tunes are catchy and my son loves it! The only thing that surprised me is that there is no singing of the ""ABC's"" song. My son has had the song memorized forever, but to put the letter with the visual of the song would have been nice to see. Either way, he loves it, and it's helping him learn!"	4.0	My 3-year-old LOVES this!	2011-04-14	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3WW100DZM8LS	Kate West	I just purchased this video for my 3 year old son and am thoroughly impressed by the quality of this product.  The video goes through each letter of the alphabet teaching viewers the sound of each letter and noting the lower and upper case writing of each.  Each letter comes with a silly antic that children can associate the letter with and there is a reoccuring catchy tune that my son was singing right away.This video primarily teaches phonics, but combined with whole word training it can be a very effective tool in teaching your child the beginning stages of reading.  I have been using this video as part of an integrated learning approach with workbooks and just noticing letters and sounds in our everyday environment and am amazed at my sons level of interest and ability to catch on.  Making learning fun, rather than work is hugely important to me so a video that my sons finds entertaining while I know is educational is a winner for me!	5.0	Excellent training in phonics	2008-09-21	0	0	0

He is three and my daughter is two. She is now starting to listen and watch it. I love this tape but couldn't find any more like it in tell one day i pulled it up and found this.

But, it goes to show that adults shouldn't judge by their own tastes -- as my son really loves it.  Moreover, I credit it for making learning all the letter sounds fun and easy to learn.Great video.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1MFIVHYJS11WY	"Kathy Carrington ""book fiend"""	"I got this video for my daughter when she was about 22 months.  I didn't know if the story would hold her or not so I skipped to the start of the letters.  She didn't sit and watch it but it was on in the room while she played.  After 2 or 3 showings, I was shocked when she pointed to the letter W in a puzzle and made the proper sound for the W!  Now at 27 months, she knows all of her letters, both uppercase and lowercase.  I hadn't expected that to happen so fast! She also will watch the entire video at this point and understands the basics of the story.  I'm now moving on to ""The Letter Factory""."	5.0	Very Good!	2008-11-17	0	0	0

I bought this dvd for him and he asks for it every day - he goes over to the tv and starts reciting letters.  Now, about a month or so after buying this video, he knows every letter of the alphabet and is even starting to write some of them on paper.  I have no guilt for letting him watch this for a half hour while I cook dinner, like I do with some of the other kids shows, because I know he is really learning from it...This video is a must have!!!	5.0	my son is obsessed with his letters!	2006-07-08	1	1	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1LGZGUJDYIXC1	Kathy	My son received this for his 2nd birthday.  After a few weeks where he asked to watch it at least once every day, he can identify almost all letters and the sounds they mention.  He also excitedly points out when he sees letters on signs or in books; he isn't always 100% correct, but he is excited about them.  He also doesn't realize it is an educational video; he loves pointing out funny things that happen in the video/dvd.  I am making a point of giving this dvd as gifts to other 2 year on my list this year, and hope to introduce my son to the next installment as a christmas present.	5.0	A great tool for learning letters	2004-11-08	2	2	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A29CBFO78A3V4Z	kim	My son watched this video several times in the car and now knows all his lettters and most of the sounds, he is not quite 2 1/2.  It is not your typical letter and sounds video where things are so repetitive you are bored to death.  This has characters and a story line.  The sounds are associated with things my son is familiar with.  I never thought we would be able to watch anything but his construction videos but he asks for this over that almost everytime!	5.0	Awesome way to learn letters!	2013-04-27	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1HW4O8XGHWSPM	Kim	Just like all the the other reviewers we are amazed at what this DVD has done for our just turned 3 yr old.  She got this for her birthday and within one week is walking around the house constantly singing the entire alphabet phonetically.  She LOVES this DVD.  Even her older sister (age 9) is glued to it. I found in her backpack a piece of paper she had drawn in school which has every single letter from this DVD dressed in the exact costume they wear in the movie. (ie the K is in the karate outfit, the S has the rattle snakes tail and tongue, the P is puffy like popcorn etc.)  We also bought the Word Factory DVD at the same time and they love that one too!	5.0	Wants to watch it over and over again!	2005-06-29	1	1	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3RS20TVZMC9IA	Kindle Customer	I bought this video for my 21 month old son after reading the reviews. He is a late talker and I thought this might help. I can't say enough about this video and now reccommend it to everyone I know. After just two weeks he can already name and make the sounds for almost all the letters in the alphabet and I have noticed a tremendous improvement in his language development. The video is truely brilliant and so enjoyable that he now asks to watch it everyday. Even better is it coordinates so well with the leap frog refrigerator magnet set- one of his favorite toys. I wish I could give this more than five stars. Can't wait to go buy the word factory video and any others they may come out with!	5.0	Best video we own	2004-08-03	3	3	0

I had heard, as you might have, about the new ""Chicken Selects"" being offered, and naturally, I couldn't resist the tender white meat strips of fried goodness.  However, upon arriving at my local(frequently patronized) McDonald's, I found myself agasp at the news delivered by the boy at the register.  Apperently, THIS particular McDonald's does NOT, in fact, offer ""Chicken Selects.""  What is this sham?? How can ONE McDonald's offer this dish, but not ANOTHER??  I was told the closest McDonald's that offered them was ""maybe over in Nyack they got `em.""  What was I to do? I took my tneder crispy sandwich and left.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1E92DHQZYDDZE	K. Nagowski	I am an educator and bought this video to help get my 2 1/2 year old interested in learning her letters.  She loves to music and enjoys singing,so I thought I would buy it for long car rides.  Within two weeks she knows all her letters and their sounds.  I have corrected her on the L and R since they are not correct, but her interest is now high and she asks about letters all the time and when I ask her the sound they make, she tells me.  She is also making good transfer of her new learning.  If I ask her what letter does dog or wagon begin with and I slow down the first letter sound, she can tell the correct letter.  I would highly recommend this as a tool, but encourage parents to work with their child also so they learn both upper and lower case letters and say the sounds correctly.	4.0	Engaging little ones & peeking interest in letters and sounds	2010-01-06	0	0	0

Which is awesome if you have a child who runs for the hills at the first hint of anything educational like I do. Now after a few times my 5 year old HAS gotten bored with it.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2YCXFIBOV9YM2	KT	Since children have different learning styles and abilities, no single product is right for all kids.  However, this one was excellent for my younger daughter.  At 3.5 she watched this movie twice and could immediately pick out any CVC word from a group of 36 on index cards, and she was reading independently by 4.  She started kindergarten several years ahead in reading, although her comprehension is not as high as her ability to decode words.  (The danger in being very good at phonics; she can read the words far above what she actually understands.)  This video really worked for her.

He's had them for around three weeks and already knows the songs (he hums them) and is starting to say his letters and sounds! He gets so tickled at some of the scenes in this movie (his favorite is the ""G"" room).  I have to admit I really enjoy watching them with him! Cute graphics, great lessons and catchy tunes!

He sings along as they say ""The M says mmmm, ..."", etc and knows most of his letters already!

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1DZWRVEPMW1UI	Lauren	This is a great DVD.  I bought it for my daughter when she was 22 months old.  She absolutely loves it.  At first, she wanted to watch it almost every day.  Within two weeks, she had learned many letter names and half of the letter sounds.I like that the video isn't too fast-paced or flashy.  The setting is a letter factory where living, talking letters are taught their sounds.  They go through each classroom and show a letter making a sound.  (The Qs quack, the Ss are taught by a snake.)  Then there's a short song about each letter sound.  It's a little annoying for me to hear the same tune 26 times, but my daughter likes it.	5.0	My daughter loves Letter Factory	2012-03-29	0	0	0

He can identify the letters and say the letter and/or make the sound.  We also have the Leapfrog Fridge Phonics Letter Set which has played a large part in his learning.  My son only said about 20 words up until a month or so ago, so we are astonished at how quickly he has learned the letters  and he now says over 50 words.  This is one of the best DVDs we have.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3IQQJPGZ2RDN7	Learner	"Our two-year old daughter loves this video. I highly recommend it.It's primary strength is introducing the alphabet in a memorable way. But it also introduces basic phonics/letter sounds. She has started to go around the house singing, ""The A says `a', the A says `a'...."" But you will need more than this video to teach all the sounds that letters can make.As an adult, I found the frog characters and the ""PR"" theme of the main frame story a little annoying. But I think it's a good video for kids.If your kids see a lot of TV, they might have a different reaction than our daughter did to this video. We don't let her watch a lot of TV unless it's educational for her (studies show TV and rapidly changing video images are not healthy for kids' brain development, especially before age 3).By the way, this is a standalone DVD that plays in your regular DVD player. You don't need the LeapPad or any special Leapfrog products to view it."	5.0	Great	2005-01-02	1	1	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2Z60PVKWFO3SW	"Learning All The Time ""It's Never Too Late to..."	"Everyone thought my 28 month old was a genius - he knew all of his letters, AND the sounds they made!!  Once I had him with me when I stopped by my daughter's kindergarten class, and he waltzed in there and started naming the letters in words around the room and the kids just stared at him like he was an alien.  That was pretty funny.Anyway, I really credit all that to this DVD, because other than a few readings of ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"", I didn't have the time or desire to push academics or pull out flash cards.For some reason, kids really respond to this DVD.  I have recommended it to several friends - some with toddlers, and another with a kindergartener who was having trouble with letter recognition.  All of them made significant progress towards mastery of letters and sounds.Personally I can't really figure it out - the video is almost annoying, with its high pitched cutsie voices, bland graphics, big-eyed frogs, and silly songs.  But kids, particularly toddlers, don't see it that way.BTW, all of the Leap Frog videos are good - Math Factory, Word Factory, and Complex Word Factory.  Putting in these videos is a guilt free way to grab 30 minutes to fold laundry or get dinner on the table."	5.0	Really works!!  Great gift idea!!	2005-11-21	8	8	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A8WQ3JDMEB4XN	Leroy Smith	I have been teaching for 18 years.  I bought this DVD for my son.  He watches it about 4 times a week.  He know knows about 6-8 letters and their sounds.  My son is 2.3 years old.In my job I am frequently rquired to assess the cognitive development of young children.  Many of these children are 6, 7 and even 8 years old and do not have a firm grasp of their letters or their sounds.This DVD will not take the place of working and playing with your child, but it acts as a very powerful supplement.The DVD is consistent, it uses the same song for each letter.  The only drawback is that most of the lower case letters are not reviewed, only the uppercase.  However, if this is the only draw back to having your child ready to read by 3 years then it is well worth it.I would recommend this DVD to parents of young children or even parents or teachers of children with learning difficulties.	4.0	Great Start	2009-12-09	2	1	1

After only a few times watching Letter Factory he knew all his letters and recognized them by sound.  It's amazing to see a lil guy like him knowing all that so soon.  I love this and would highly recommend it to anyone.  As a matter of fact I bought one for all 3 of my siblings to let their kids (which are a year or 2 older and didn't know letters yet)watch and learn.  Sure enough, they learned it as well. What a great concept they use to teach by singing.  The ""A"" says ""Ah"" every letter makes a sound the ""A"" says ""Ah"". Then using a purple monster costume to scare the ""A's"" into saying ""Ahhhh"".  It's cute and I enjoying watching it with him.  You can stop it after each letter segment and review the letters if you like.  Also on the menu it has a game.  Use your remote to play.  It says for instance, what letter says ""mmm"".  Then you can help your child scroll through the letters or you can as he/she points to the correct letter.  Select the correct letter and balloons and clapping and saying ""Yay"" go up the screen.  The DVD is about 45 minutes long.  This is a must have for any child 2-6 that hasn't learned all this yet."	5.0	2 1/2 yr. old knows his letters & sounds!!	2007-01-03	0	0	0

The simple song that flows through the whole movie is what makes this special.  All of my kids have learned their beginning phonics through this DVD.  In fact I had lost my original copy and just re-bought it for my two year old. It is that good that I knew we needed to re-buy.The DVD goes through upper and lower case of each letter.  It shows the kids the letters and the sounds they make.  That is what really helps kids.  They are not just learning to identify but to also sound out the words.  There is an entire series which is also good (but not as good as this beginning DVD).  Then there is the song that tells each letter and sound.  We sing this song around the house all the time.  The thing is they kids are learning without out realizing.  It really is a great foundation for learning letters/sounds and eventually reading.	5.0	Best DVD for learning Letters!	2013-03-05	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A30L71YS5RLLG	"L. J. Roberts ""renaisancedudette"""	"My son just turned three and he has been watching this DVD for three days.  He has watched it two or three times a day, and he can already tell me sounds for letters that I've never tried to teach him.  The only way he could be learning them is from this magnificent video.  My daughter, who already knows the letter sounds, finds those sounds reinforced as she watches the show.For the real stickler, I can think of two things in this video that adults might not like.  First, after Tad (the youngest frog) learns the sound of the letter M, he burps.  However, the burp is very small (not a rude belch like so many shows have these days) and Tad says ""Excuse me"" immediately after.  It didn't bother me, but some might find it offensive.  The other item concerns the letter W, the sound of which is done to rap music.  I personally wish LeapFrog had chosen music other than rap since I don't want my children to develop a taste for that kind of music, but I believe that a small showing of it will be more than balanced by the music we normally listen to.  I mention this so people who are thinking of buying this DVD will know about anything to which they might possibly object.On the plus side, this DVD has many positives besides teaching letter sounds.  The frog children, Leap, Lily, and Tad do not bicker with each other, but instead treat each other lovingly while they try to help each other.  In addition, they do not back talk to their parents.Despite the two minor flaws, this gem of a DVD really teaches letter sounds in a loving, happy way, and my kids, age 3 and 5, love it enough to watch it several times a day.  And since it's so educational, I love letting them watch it!  (I also recommend the related DVD, Talking Words Factory.)"	5.0	Learning letter sounds in three days!	2006-03-29	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A19QGXZ1YSHML2	Luke's Mom	"We don't watch a lot of TV, so this was a real treat for my son.  He would earn this video with good behavior, and he was learning also.  He also loves Math Circus.  We started this video at age 2 1/2, which was perfect.  After about five times through of just staring at it, he just started singing along.  The songs are so catchy, that he couldn't help but remember.  He started pointing out letters on signs and all over the place in the car.  It's so obvious this series was designed by preschool educators that really know what captures the attention of kids age 2-5.  Wonderful series!Update 2012-My second little boy als learned his letters with this video.  I can teach a certain amount, but it takes me so long by myself, when I can teach along with this wonderful video.  My first son was very visual and this video was the key to what I had been missing teaching him myself.  My second son is very auditory, memorizing books and song lyrics easily at age 2.  So this video didn't cause him to immediately grasp all (probably half) of the letters, though he did love to sing along.  So, I brought in a physical element -block capital letter magnets from Mardel store.  We held them in our hands and looked at them during each letter and reviewed the letters four at a time.  Then used the magnets in the car ( I would hold one up) and we would sing the song.  Within a week of getting the magnets, and watching the video a few more times with me, he had all 26 letters and sounds committed to memory.  That was at 34 months.  Now at 40 months (and we do not practice letters very often anymore) he says S-S-S School bus starts with ""S"" Mommy!  and D-D-D Daddy starts with ""D""!  so he is applying to our daily lives and conversations.  Awesome.  I have gifted several of his classmates with this video for birthday presents.  Get it!"	5.0	"""Every Letter Makes A Sound, the 'E' says ""eh!""..."""	2007-01-03	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3AXC959W4KJ6W	"Lunataina ""lunataina"""	I purchased this video for my 3 year old daughter who is beginning to learn her letters.  I was not sure what to expect when I bought it, but I was confident on the quality of Leap Frog products in general.  This video is no exception.  The cartoon features a story which takes the younger of the Frog kids, Tad, through the Letter Factory training rooms where he learns all the sounds the letters make.  Each letter is afforded about a minute of time, which does not seem like much, but with repetition (my daughter asks to see this video several times every day since I purchased it) the children remember more and more of the letters and sounds.  The video is 35 minutes long.  The story is interesting to children and uses a combination of songs and visual prompts to help the kids learn and remember the letters and their sounds.  My daughter was singing along with this video the first time she saw it.  While I don't think this video is enough to teach children their letters, I do think that as part of a learning program it is a wonderful learning tool.  I use the video, then bring out my daughter's My First Leap Pad (I Know My ABC's) for her to use, I help her write the letters on her Magna Doodle, set up art activites for her with the letters, read her ABC books, cut out textured sand paper letters for her to play with, etc.  The only things I found missing in this video are that they only give the short vowel sounds and that they don't talk enough about lower case letters. However it is only a 35 minute video, and I can teach her those other concepts myself.  I also thought they went through the letters a bit fast for kids having trouble with basic letter recognition, but again, it is a short video and parents can always use other techniques to help their children with letter recognition (plus repetitive viewing of the video can help).  Overall, the video serves its purpose very well.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It's interesting enough to hold the children's attention and it teaches useful concepts in a fun way.  I am definitely purchasing the next Leap Frog video (Word Factory) once she learns her letters a little better, so she can start to learn the concept of how letters come together to make words.  Learning happens one step at a time.	5.0	Wonderful Learning Tool	2004-04-18	0	0	0

However, I have been so pleased with this purchase I just had to comment!  My two and  a half year old daughter has had this video for less than two weeks and has made tremendous strides with her efforts to verbalize all the letters and their sounds.  She has a minor articulation delay, so this is something that we've been working on for the past several months.  Since we brought this DVD home, she has shown much more interest in her ""ABC's"" and asks to watch the video daily.  We have a couple of other Leap Frog products that reinforce the same letter/letter-sound phonetic philosophy, but for some reason this video has been the thing that has captured her interest the most.  As a result, she has become much more interested in the other toys (flash cards, refidgerator magnets, etc...) since her exposure to this video.  I must say, as far as the video itself is concerned, it is truly one of the most clever introductions to phonics that I've ever seen.  (Our speech therapist thought so as well.)

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2SN1YMKRS52PF	lynaya	I am a professional educator and a mother.  This and all the other Leap Frog DVD's are the best by far.  I have seen and evaluated many other learning DVD's from the perspectives of both a teacher and a mother, and Leap Frog is the best by far.  This DVD does a perfect job of teaching letter sounds in an engaging way.  It's hard to find a DVD that kids will want to watch repeatedly.  Repetition is the key to early reading success, so if the show is not engaging enough to watch over and over, then the content is irrelevant.  My daughter is two-years-old and is already beginning to read short words largely due to these DVD's. Of course nothing can replace parental interaction, but if you use these DVD's as a common ground between you and your child, you can't go wrong.  Watching these WITH your child while interacting, then following-through and reinforcing the concepts afterwords is really the only early reading program a typical child would need. You might first want to begin with the letter amusement park DVD, which helps with basic letter identification, then move on to this one which is the best for learning letter sounds once the letters become identifiable.  Then move on to the word factory and so forth.  The math DVD's by Leap Frog are also excellent.  It's worth the investment.  I hope this helps!  :)	5.0	The Very Best on the Market	2011-10-20	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3Q4NSNIAH9HBB	LyndiC	My daughter had this when she was about 3 (now 8), and she loved it. She watched it all the time, and when she started preschool, she could single out each letter and their sounds, which was apparently a pretty big deal compared to some of the other children in her class. It gave her a great foundation for beginning to read and sound out her words.So now that my son is getting older, we wanted to start playing this for him as well, and we're also hoping it will help his speech therapy along. We couldn't find the one we used to have, so started looking for a new one. I found a listing on Amazon that had the same cover artwork as our original, but was way more than we wanted to pay. We went ahead with this one, hoping the format of the show was the same, and it's the EXACT same video, just with updated artwork, and way cheaper!! The DVD arrived quickly and brand new, in perfect condition. Yes, the animation looks a little outdated, but my kids watch all the newest movies as well my old cartoons from the 80's, so this isn't an issue at our house.Since my daughter's success with it when she was young, I have and will continue to recommend this product!	5.0	Same DVD, Updated packaging	2013-11-05	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1A3HZR807PRJG	"Lynn A. Murray ""L's mom"""	I ordered this video in the fall for my 21 month old from the advise of my sister. Does a 21 month old really need to learn the entire alphabet- probably not. But we were being typical parents of the first born and decided to try it out. My daughter could identify every letter and its sounds within a week of watching the video once a day! She turned two in February and it is amazing to see how she is using the alphabet! When we go on walks or we are in the car- she will yell out letters as she sees them on signs or buildings.  It has been so much fun seeing her learn her letters. I highly recommend the DVD. It is a wonderful tool to engage your young child!  The only item of issue is that it does emphasize uppercase vs. lowecase and I see her struggling to identify lower case letter that are vastly different from their uppercase partner. I just take it as an opportunity to teach her the lower case letters.	5.0	Great learning tool!	2010-04-15	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3H6RFWW8PFSHO	Madeline Brown	I had heard great things about this DVD, but I was skeptical of some of the glowing reviews.  Still, I figured it was worth a try.After my three and four-year-old watched it the first time, they begged to watch it again.  For several days, they immersed themselves in it.  That has subsided, but this DVD is still a favorite in our house, and even if they never watched it again, I would still say we got our money's worth because of how much they were able to learn from it.  By the second day of watching it, they knew every letter sound on the DVD!  Now, when we go places, they will point to signs, identify, the letters, and I will start singing the song that goes with every letter in this DVD (to the tune of the Farmer in the Dell), &#34;The A says...,&#34; they will say, &#34;Ahhh,&#34; and then we are on our way to sounding out a word.  It is absolutely amazing!  I like to think I have particularly bright kids, but they have never been identified as child prodigies or anything, just typical kids with a love of learning.We are a homeschooling family and use it to supplement Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons, which I also recommend, although that book is not as fun as the Letter Factory DVD for them, and I think it would have taken them a lot longer to grasp phonics if we had not supplemented with the DVD.  Even if your child is not yet in school or attends a preschool outside of the home, I still highly recommend this DVD.  It is both entertaining (for its intended audience, anyway...even for parents, it's not so bad you'll be wanting to stab your ears with Q-tips to make the singing go away like with some children's programming) and educational.My only regret is that we did not get it sooner.	5.0	Makes Learning Fun	2014-04-30	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1I4MVN4IYCKZV	Mag	"I got the Letter Factory DVD for my 17 month old daughter in February. She looked completely mesmerized since the first time we played it to her. She would laugh and squeal and bounce and imitate the sounds, and request to watch it everyday. After about a month, one day when we were idle in the car, I thought I would play a game by asking her if she knew "" A says ...."" what...She knew... and I kept going.We stopped at ""W""! She knew every sound from A to W! I asked her again at random order and she knew everyone except X, Y, and Z. She was only 18 months old and I never taught her phonics except playing her the DVD. This was a huge surprise. After that I noticed she would try to pronouce words that are around her.. labels... books... even signs and ads on the street. This DVD has provided a wonderful tool for me to teach our little toddler new words, and for her to say them properly. For instance, she's been saying CAR for a long time, but she used to pronouce it as ""GAR"". After I knew that she had learnt ""C"" says ""Ca"". I used that to teach her the correct pronounciation of CAR. Now she can say it crisp and clear every single time.I have started showing her the Talking Word Factory and she loves it, too.I must commend Leapfrog for putting out such a marvellous product, and would recommend it to all parents with young children."	5.0	This DVD is truly AMAZING!!!	2005-04-06	1	1	0

Well, the first time he watched it, he watched the ENTIRE video - and imitated ""b"" and ""h""!!! I was shocked!! It's been 3 weeks since I bought this viedo and my son (who will be 16 mos old in 2 days) knows ALOT of his letter sounds BY HEART - even if I mix the letters around! He's mastered a, b, c, d, h, m, n, o, p, t, w, y, z - he occasionally sounds out g, r, and s! AMAZING!!"	5.0	best thing ever!	2010-09-12	0	0	0

At first I wasn't sure if I liked the idea of the vowels only being presented as the short sounds, but I think that makes the most sense.  Kids will easily remember that the letter can make it's own sound, but the short sound is harder so it's wonderful that he's learning it. After watching this for a couple weeks my son is starting to sound out words when we read books and figures out ""mom"" or ""on"" pretty well.

My preschool granddaughters sing the sounds of the letters while playing on the swingset, taking a bath, etc. so they're still learning even when they show is over.  I would rate this item much higher than 5 if I could!Trust me, if you have preschool children (or older children who need help with phonics) this is well worth buying.  My older granddaughters (ages 7 and 9) watch this over and over too.  For whatever reason, none of them ever seem to get tired of it!I wish I hadn't spent so much money on Disney etc. movies now, because from here on out it's Leap Frog videos all the way!	5.0	Kids prefer it over Disney Films!!	2005-05-13	3	2	1

I thought it was great, but it ended up on the shelf.  We also got the Leap Frog Letter Factory little board book at a yard sale that rarely got read (us reading it to her.)  Despite these and other toys that are supposed to help little ones learn their letters, my daughter seemed to have little interest in the subject.  She could recognize 3 or 4 letters, but otherwise she didn't much care and we didn't push.That all changed once I got this video!  She watched it twice the first time we popped it in.  Once I realized that the story in the video matched the story in the book, I got it out and she eagerly followed along, turning the page for each letter.  After watching it a few more times within a week she started playing with the Fridge Phonics.  The songs match the ones on the video and I hear her singing along, ""S says sssss....every letter makes a sound...""  Now she points out a letter or at least make the phonetic sound when we are out and about.  It is great!The video itself is pleasant to watch.  It is not too ""cutesy"" and the story is nice.  The songs are catchy but not annoying.  I was happy to sit down and watch it with my daughter, even if more than once in a day.I don't know what it is about this video, but our daughter is finally interested in learning her letters.  It may still be awhile before she gets them all down, but at least she is finally excited to learn about them.  I also love that she is learning the phonetic sounds.  All in all I am very happy with this video.  Great buy!"	5.0	Finally she is interested	2008-04-26	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AHYKKUQM2Z6BE	MB	I won't reiterate what other reviewers have said about the positives of this DVD. I just can't believe no one has commented on how it is totally starring and largely about boys. Before you mistake me for some PC-crazed maniac looking for sexism in every nook and cranny, I can assure you that I am not. But, I have a little girl and it is startling- the dad is the employee at the letter factory, mr. websley is the boss, the professor is male, and of course tad is also. His older brother calls the shots, and at the end when he fakes laryngitis to give tad a chance to host the show, the sister is not even considered! Hey no need for YOU to fake laryngitis, girl! Even most of the letters are male- I did a quick check and it is over 75%. It's just sad for me. It's like when I watched toy story before I had a kid I didn't really notice that the lame bo beep character was the only girl, but now I do. Just offering my opinion for those who care about these things, and maybe as a heads up for those who actually make these videos.	3.0	One problem- sexist	2012-10-19	14	10	4

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3KTKOY77QGBC1	Melissa	"I liked this DVD a lot. My son knows all his letters, though not because of this DVD. He got interested and learned his letters through the Leap Frog Learning Hoops toy and I thought he would love this DVD. He likes it, but not as much as Baby Einstein, Veggie Tales, and Thomas the Tank Engine. I'm sure if he wasn't hearing impaired, it would be a lot easier for him to enjoy it and discriminate between the sounds that the letters make more easily. Overall, it's a great DVD!**UPDATE** 1/19/08 My son has taken a stronger liking to this DVD and I often hear him imitating the letter sounds (even the ones that are hard for him as a hearing impaired child!). I often hear him say, ""every letter makes a sound the __ says..."" And my TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER is even saying these things!!

After trying several things to get him to settle down long enough to teach him and failing miserably, I bought this after a friend recommended it.  Within 2 weeks my son knows all the sounds and can recognize every letter even out of order!  Plus, as if that wasn't enough, I have noticed he is now showing much more interest in ""reading"" his own books instead of automatically giving them to us to read to him.  Out of any educational toy or video I have bought for him this is, by far, the best and most effective!  If Leapfrog ever comes out with a number video, I will be FIRST in line!

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A33BFKXP3R2D55	M. Freckleton	We bought this video after my son's kindergarten teacher sent it home to help him learn the alphabet.  At first I was a little put off - My husband and I try to limit TV and we were not excited about playing a video for learning.  I soon changed my mind!  My 5 year old, who had resisted many of my attempts to learn letters (books, letter magnets and more), loved this video.  He learned his letters and the sounds that they made in no time, and he went from behind in his class to a little above average in the first quarter.  We have five of the Leap Frog videos total and my boys love them all.  My three year old knows many letters and their sounds, and is already showing interest in writing them too.  I give all of the credit to Leap Frog Letter Factory.One thing to know is that the song that they use to teach the letters and their sounds is VERY catchy.  You will be hearing it in your sleep after you play this video.  Fortunately, I didn't mind the song and the fact that the tune is so catchy ensures that your little one remembers the letters and their sounds.Highly recommended!	5.0	Excellent learning tool	2008-01-31	0	0	0

If there are going to be moments when I throw on the tv in weakness I'd rather she watch something informative. This is a good pick and much better than sesame street. Colorful and fun way to learn phonics though they disregard the fact that some letters have multiple sounds such as a, c, e, g, i, o, and u. I guess it was just easier to present one sound to fit the sing-song format they use. I figure this will teach the basics and I can expand on the rest later.	5.0	educational thrill for the kid, a snore for me	2007-01-23	0	0	0

We homeschool and I had gone through one reading curriculum and tried two other approaches on my own.  We were most recently doing Hooked on Phonics but with the old version and he wasn't progressing very well with that. He was stuck with the letter sounds. He was frustrated beause his twin brother was doing great with his reading and was moving forward quickly.  So, I got the new version of HOP and got this video, too, because he likes to watch movies.  Well, the DVD arrived first and, even though it is a touch too ""young"" for him, he has enjoyed it very much and has watched it every day.  By the time we got the new HOP in the mail, he knew every letter sound just from watching the movie!  He is enjoying learning to read again and was so excited to get the new HOP in the mail.  The only complaint I have is how they sound the letter ""P.""  But he remembers it now, can see there is a difference between ""P"" and ""B"" sounds (both my boys had problems distinguishing that) and I can easily correct him in saying it properly- not a huge negative, IMO."	5.0	Just what we needed...	2007-03-04	0	0	0

These are their favorite shows and watch them all the time. They hradly want to watch anything else. We bought another program (your baby can read) but both girls lost interest very quickly.

I was really disappointed, but then about 3 days later she went and got the video herself and wanted to watch it. She loved it, sang along and now only 3 weeks later can identify in books or out in public at least a dozen letters and say their sounds correctly. It is amazing!

Our daughter literally watched this DVD for two weeks--I would say at least 3-4 times per week! SHE NOW KNOWS EVERY LETTER AND EVERY SOUND THAT THEY MAKE!! IT IS TRULY A BLESSING HOW FAST SHE LEARNED THEM..We have read and worked with her so much, I felt she knew alot for her age! We felt that it would be a different story learning the alphabet!! WE WERE WRONG!! Just the other day she came up to me and started naming every letter that was on a t-shirt that I had on..It was the most adorable thing ever! What a big girl...We are so proud of her! ALSO, WITH WORKING WITH HER OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS--SHE CAN DRAW THE LETTERS H-L-O.... Yaaaaa!

They both recognized all their letters (usually upper and lower case) before seeing this video, so I have no idea whether it helps with that. But neither of them had made the connection between a letter and a sound -- they were learning how to recognize some words strictly by memorization -- and this video has made that concept click for them. Now they see a C and say ""The C says 'kuh'!""Some reviewers complained that the letter sounds are ""incorrect."" I thought this too at first, but this is only true if you're focusing on the letter's NAME. For instance, we say L as ""el."" The video says ""ul."" But if you're trying to sound out the word ""left,"" does it start with ""el""? No, it start with ""ul."" Same for O -- we call it ""oh,"" but in many words starting with O, the sound is actually ""ah"": octopus, on, off, etc.I also don't mind that it only teaches one sound for each letter. There is plenty of time for small children to learn the marvelous complexities of English.

When my second child came along, I was sadly too busy to invest the same amount of time.  When my son received this video for his 3rd birthday, I popped it in the car DVD player at his request.  Why not learn while I run errands.....he knew ALL the letters and their sounds within 2 weeks of errand running.  WOW!!  I have spent an entire year working on that with other children.  I must admit I haven't seen much of the video as it plays behind my head.  I do know all the songs, and they are very cute and catchy.  The only negative I have found is that I do not believe it covers lower case letters.  Like I said, I haven't seen the whole video, so I could be wrong.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AM0JBNH9CFA9L	modern mommy	This is a very impressive DVD!Since my son had just learned his uppercase letters and had such excitement at picking them out on signs etc. I thought learning the sounds they make would be fun for him.Since he picked up so many words from Blue's clues, which I highly recommend for 2 and under, he seemed to learn from dvds and I thought this would be a nice upgrade.Well, in 2 weeks, he only watched this DVD 4 times total, and not even completely each time.So I wasn't expecting much and was really shocked he had learned all the letter sounds, except for I (i), which he confused with the sound for Y (yi). The I came about 2 weeks later.In fact, he comes up to us to 'quiz' him, and says 'The A says..' then he chirps 'Aaah!'. And will stand there and wait for us to go thru the whole alphabet!He is so proud of himself, like he cracked some big code, which I guess, he did!Its been very empowering for him! :DAt the grocery store, he's on the lookout now for letters and then he says the sound it makes, so its made what used to be a boring trip for him, really entertaining. Thank you for that Leapfrog. ;)My only (minor) disappointment with the DVD is that I expect each Letter to have a different song, and while each one has a different clever 'story' on how they make their sound, the song they sing at the end of learning each letter is the same. The B says... the B says... every letter makes a sound, the B says... And so on.I thought each letter having its own song would be more distinctive and easier to learn for toddlers, but this is minor as it didn't slow my son down one bit!This is the most valuable dvd in our collection, my toddler asked for it often. Now that he's mastered it, I'm buying the next one in the series... we are moving onto words!	5.0	My 2 1/2 year old learn all the letter sounds after watching this DVD 4 times!	2009-01-04	1	1	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1DSTY2AWSKOX8	Mollie	"My son learned his letters really young, like under 2. He would point them out everywhere we were. But then around 3, he totally forget them. Lack of practice I guess. I would show him letters and ask him to name them, but he acted like he couldn't. Then he watched the letter factory. He asked for it over and over again. After watching it just a few times, he new every single letter and their sounds. I couldn't believe how clearly he could say each sound, since he doesn't always talk perfectly clear. Sometimes he even corrects me. If I say, ""the L says Laaa"", he says, ""No, the L says ullll"" and gives the phoentic sound. Everywhere he go he finds letters in signs, etc, and is always asking me to read what the word says. This video was worth so much, can't say enough about it."	5.0	Amazing	2012-08-16	0	0	0

I saw a difference within two weeks of him having these dvds on constant rotation in our PS3.  He always watches them with paper and pens and makes ""letters"" during the show.  He literally looked at a word the other day and sounded it out singing the song ""the o says OO"" and ""the f says FF"" and said out loud ""OFF!""  He's only three!!!  It's really sweet, too, and a perfect length to hold their attention.  I definitely recommend it!"	5.0	SO great for preschoolers	2008-06-04	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AV0CGV9ZBNMA6	Mom2One	I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't been witness to it; my daughter learned all her alphabet phonics in less than a week, and this video is the reason. We had been working on letter sounds for a while, and she was able to memorize a handful of them but would lose interest quickly, as toddlers are apt to do :) We purchased this DVD for her 2nd birthday last week, and she learned all the letter sounds almost immediately. The DVD is engaging and entertaining, with visually appealing animation and a catchy song. It has my daughter very enthusiastic about letters; she has even started identifying the beginning letter to some words! My only concern is that in contrast to other LeapFrog products, this video doesn't emphasize that some letters make more than one sound. I wouldn't let that deter you, however. In our experience, this is a must-have product for toddlers who are interested in letters or for parents who are motivated to work on pre-reading skills.	5.0	Must Have!	2010-10-10	1	1	0

They got my 3 year old so interested in words that he made me teach him every day until he learned to read at 3!!  I have now tried to start playing them for my 23 month old daughter, and my son gets mad.  He loves these videos so much that he thinks they are only his.  He loves to share almost anything else except for these videos because he is so attached to them.  I'm not one much for allowing him to watch shows that don't teach him anything.  Occasionally watching something with no educational value is ok, but it is not something we're going to do all the time.  However, I do try to find videos for him to watch that are fun and hold his attention to where he doesn't even realize it is educational.  These videos and the Rock 'n Learn videos do that.  I was just more impressed with the graphics on the leap frog videos.	5.0	My 3 year old and my 23 month old fight over this	2011-12-11	0	0	0

He was not interested in sitting down and learning about letters what-so-ever.  He kept telling me he would learn them latter.  With this video he learned his letters without even realizing that he was learning them.  It took maybe 4 or 5 times of watching this video and he could recognize all of his letters and knew all of their sounds.  Now he is coming up to me and telling me what letter a word starts with by their sounds.  It was worth every penny.  It was not only educational, but also entertained him.	5.0	Excellent Learning video	2009-09-09	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AIZJDUESKMIEI	Mom of 2	This is a great video that teaches the basic letter sounds.  I got it when my youngest was almost 3 and his brother was 4.  They both already knew their letters and most of the sounds, but this really solidified it for them.  They were quickly ready for the Talking Words Factory and the Code Word Caper.  The Code Word Caper introduces long-vowel sounds which are not addressed in the first two videos.  The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is because one of the characters, Mr. Websley, is a cantankerous, bossy, and demanding fellow.  Not exactly a great role model for the kids.  I'm VERY picky about what my children watch, so I'm guessing that for most people, this would not be terribly bothersome.	4.0	Great educational video	2008-04-26	0	0	0

The video uses innovative ways to get kids to learn the sounds.  For example in the C room the letters are kept c-c-c-cold so that the c's can learn the sound they make.  The L's l-l-l-lick l-l-l-lollipops to learn their sound!The video only teaches one sound for each letter, but we've paired this with the fridge phonics by leap frog which lists both sounds that some letters make.  My son really enjoys having the tactile letters to play with now that he knows what they are.  And when we are reading to him he asks us what the letters and words say and is making the connection that the letters on the page make the words we read to him.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2YK5KRONU6RTR	MomReview2	Even though our 5 yr old knew his ABC's & had practiced writing letters some before starting Kinder, it has been rough. He struggles with letter recognition & has some speech articulation problems that only intensify the issue. The Letter Factory is engaging enough to retain his interest after multiple viewings & catchy enough that we're able to describe the letter 'characters' when he struggles to identify letters. It helps him often make the appropriate connection & accurately name the letter. Beyond that, our 2 year old enjoys the DVD too. He has started expanding his letter vocabulary & enjoys saying the letter sounds. I REALLY wish we would have stumbled across this DVD sooner!

It teaches all the letter sounds with a catchy song.  Children like it and learn their letter sounds from it.  The only drawback is that it doesn't teach both the long and short vowel sounds, only the short.  The only other rival is Challenger School's tape which you can only purchase via Challenger Schools. Its sister DVD, Word Factory is also good but if you choose one, go with the talking letter factory.

She wanted to watch her ""ABC movie"" about ten times a day.  Within a week she knew all the letter sounds and was even recognizing the letters.  We have the letters that stick to the bathtub and she was able to name them all, and when you ask her what each letter says she gives the correct sound.  This is the most educational video we have ever seen.  Like another reviewer stated, we also have the Fridge Phonics toy and my daughter brings that with us on trips and sings the alphabet along with it.  My son is 8 months and this video holds his attention, though he won't be saying his alphabet for a while!  The video says 2-5, but I recommend this video for any age.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2DIA84J8KJJ8G	moomoomummy	This is a very good product. It teaches the alphabet  and the letter sounds in an engaging way, through songs and animation. My toddler just loves it, and showing her the DVD is about the only way to get her seated in the car seat quietly.I give this only 4 stars because of some slight flaws:- the sounds of the vowels are not consistent because the characters in the dvd sound them differentlye.g it's difficult to make out the difference between 'A', 'E', 'U'; 'O' sounds like 'ohhh' and 'ahhh'- the dvd doesn't differentiate between long and short vowels- there is an emphasis on uppercase letters; lettercase letters are important for emergent reading cos they occur more frequently in the written language.My toddler has learnt letters that have similar looking upper and lowercase letters. However, she has trouble recognising the rest of the alphabet. My friend's toddler, however, has learnt both upper and lower case letters from this dvd.	4.0	Emphasis on uppercase letters	2010-10-22	2	1	1
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2ZOO1T50UXRP8	"Mother of 2 ""momknowsbest"""	Does this product really need yet another 5 star review?  I will do it anyway because I absolutely love this product!I began putting in this video for my oldest daughter beginning on her second birthday, about every other day.  By one month, when I said a letter, she told me the sound it made.  By 2 months after that, she knew all the names of the letters.  I began writing 2 and 3 letter words on little slips of paper that she would pick out of a little box and by 2 and a half years old, she was reading 3 letter words.I've had my youngest watch it every now and then (about once a week). At 18 months she knows the sounds to 3 or 4 letters...I think she'd know others but she can't say the other sounds at all.  She has not talked as quickly as my oldest.I am sure that results will vary with each child, but I have been very happy with the results in my 2 kids.	5.0	Learn letters in one month!	2009-09-01	0	0	0

Pizzullo ""Sonuvspam"""	"I got this in a buying frenzy for my 1 yr old in the Philippines...(still had money left after all the baby einstein vidoes LOL)She has an older sister (3yrs)who is very bright, but has not had the benefit of english language upbring. I expect this to balance out later, as she will be bilingual, but I really worried about the selection of english language learning materials for preschoolers that i would find when I went, so I loaded up and hand carried 400 pounds of of phonics materials, videos and workbooks. This was by far the best of the bunch.My 1 yr old is still a bit young for it, but she dances to the songs, and the 3 yr old absolutely loves it. It has even helped her mother and aunts refine thier accents. The baby einstein stuff is pretty slow paced for a 3 yr old, but I expect to get some extra legs out of them since she is really just getting her first exposure to english with them. They are good for the baby, and good to bore the 3yr old away from the TV for awhile(she wants to watch the letter factory 24 hours a day). Although it kills any dreams of limitting TV time, these videos are extra important, becuase I want her to get a solid grounding in english, and especially proper American Standard dialact...something just not available, even in the english speaking prescool I just enrolled her in, since everyone speaks english with an accent - which is to be expected.On a side note, I was pretty ticked off at Disney..although the baby einstein materials are obviously good quality, I do feel like I paid 300 bucks for a total of about 45 minutes of sock puppets and video of toys that I could have bought for less than the cost of the videos. But worst of all, among the ABC stuff that was available in PI...much of it was by Disney Corp...and they had the audacity to use ""Disney"" for the letter D on an ABC poster...what a shameless stab at cultivating brand loyalty. Not Dog, Duck, Dinner...but Disney. Disgusting. AT any rate, the kids love the video and I got the rest of the set on the way."	5.0	Outstanding	2011-05-02	1	1	0

Unlike puzzles, board books, etc. it's not a matter of placement memorization but true recall of letters and sounds. It's honest to goodness learning.Originally I purchased Fridge Phonics and my son just wasn't catching on. Now we use both tools together and they are a wonderful learning tool.I can take any letter and ask him what it is. If he is stumped I just start to sing the familar song or make the sound of the letter and he will instantly recall the letter or sound. This DVD is set up so you can teach the ABC's and Phonics in 4 letter groupings, or you can simply sit and watch it all the way through while interacting with your child.I'm so excited by this product that I will be purchasing Word Caper and Math Circus next.A must have for all parents!

She was particularly resistant to learning her letters when I attempted to teach her, but in a few weeks of viewing the Leap Frog Letter Factory (3 or 4 times a week) she can now recognize her upper case letters and knows their corresponding sounds. She constantly sings the catchy song used in the DVD to teach the sound each letter makes. I only rated the DVD 4 stars, since I thought that the lower case letters should have been included as well. By the way, my 6 yr old asks to watch the DVD as well (even though she already reads above her grade level).

And in just the few times my kids have watched the DVD, my 3 year old has learned many of the letters and sounds that she didn't already know. The Talking Words Factory and Code Word Caper have been equally as impressive. My son has started writing many words he did not write prior to seeing these DVDs. Even though these two DVD's are more complex for my 3 yr old, she loves them as well and is getting a good introduction to creating words with letters. I highly recommend these DVDs.

After three weeks of having it, with him watching it maybe five times a week, he can say every letter clearly and correctly.  This DVD has made a world of difference!

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AXFGFT8J1QNM3	N. Clifton	Leap Frog - Letter FactoryI bought this DVD to watch with my granddaughter.  By 22 months she knew the letters of the alphabet and I thought this DVD might help to reinforce it in a fun way.  It surpassed my expectations because now at 24 months my adorable granddaughter now knows the sound that each letter makes and can tell you words that start with each letter as well.  She recognizes letters on boxes, cards, and signs and tries to sound out the letters.  She also can tell you several words that start with each of the letters.  She's just turned 2 at the end of December!!  It's incredible.  I have now ordered Talking Words Factory and am looking forward to watching it with her.  (Check back for my review on Talking Words Factory too!)  The video makes the way the letter produces the sound easy for a child to understand AND remember.  It is a wonderful learning product presented in a fun and exciting way. (I'm a retired librarian and am always on the lookout for great learning materials.)

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AL3UI8LF5A42L	N. Crawford	It is no surprise to me that some people are incredibly naive when they buy things on amazon, they buy a DVD and expect their child to magically learn the alphabet within days and sit threw the entire thing every time from start to end.I am not writing a load of Tosh from a teachers perspective or a psychologist point of view. Simply from a mother of a toddler. Being Scottish living in the USA (where they pronounce letters different from the rest of the world) it is already a learning curve for me to teach my daughter the American sounds like J (Jiy and Jay ) and Z (Zed and Zee). I was looking for something to go along with our books and flash cards.This DVD does a great job at keeping up the pace, it gives the sound along with the letter name which makes it easier for my toddler to link the two and the graphics (that someone said looks like 80's graphics) are great. They are sharp and clear from things that might distract. I watched with my daughter to ask her what the letter was each time.Great learning aid for toddlers.  It has been PROVEN to help children learn ABC's but all kids learn differently so you have to buy this DVD knowing that . Flash cards are great to do with this to help teach lower case letters .	4.0	Great tool for learning	2013-10-14	0	0	0

The only tv he watches is Super Why and Sesame Street and the occasional toddler movie, so he is not a huge 'sit and watch tv' kid. This did not hold his interest, nor mine, the first several times we tried it. But then he grew more interested in and started interacting with it, repeating the letter sounds and shouting out the letters. Now he asks to watch it at least once a week, and just as my mom friends told me, I have noticed an increase in understanding, as well as interest, in the alphabet, letters and their sounds from him.

However, he really does watch this whole show.  The characters are cute and colorful, but the animation is simple enough not to be overwhelming.  Do not expect a movie of cinematic genius, but do expect something your pre-schooler will love.  Aside from the letter learning, the story and how the characters interact and treat eachother is charming and appropriate without being too saccharin.Additionally, and most importantly, he was repeating letter sounds the very first time he watched it.  He already has a favorite letter, ""W"", which he calls ""double.""  He dances to the music and I think it helps that he has the magnetic letter set and the little player that came with them sings the same song for each letter and it's sound, so he recognized it.I was nervous when it first started playing because the legal warnings at the beginning were very poor video quality and I thought maybe the whole movie would be that bad, but it was ok once the movie started.  I love the letter song, it is so cute, that I sing everyone of them!  It is repetative, but that's what makes it such a good learning tool.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	ANM52MEHG497T	Nimue Amethyst	I have tried everything to get my energetic four-year-old started reading.  He knew letters, but I couldn't find anything to get him beyond that.  He loves playing with his leap pad, and he also loves watching movies, so I picked up this video and he was telling us what sounds the letters made almost immediately.  It's true that they only teach one sound per letter, but I feel this is less confusing.  Even with one sound per letter, they can still assemble simple words by sounding them out.  Both of my boys watch this video over and over, as well as the Talking Words Factory video, and now not only is the four-year-old starting to put sounds together to make words, but the two-year-old is learning the letter sounds.  The animation and the sonds keep the kids engaged, and each letter has a special trick to help the kids remember their sound.  I find the older one pantomiming each function while he tries to connect sounds.  We've tried other videos and have been less successful.  I'd recommend this video even if your child does not know the alphabet yet, because it teaches the names of the letters along with the sounds.	5.0	Last Resort	2004-04-04	4	4	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A39YVZ77UIMQLL	OhMyReview	Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!This is the most fun and creative DVD for teaching Letter recognition and sound.I bought this when my daughter was 18-month old. She doesn't like letters no matter how I present it -- magnetic letters, flash card etc. She loves numbers and can count from 1 to 10 but not consistently correct. She sometimes skip a number. She also cannot recognize numbers yet but she loves it. So what I did, I purchased Numberland and Letter Factory at the same time.I figure if I let her watch Numberland, she'll love it because it's about numbers and get use to the Leapfrog format and sure enough she got addicted to that. Recognize Numbers 1 to 10 in less than a week and was able to count consistently correct from 1 to 10. In the same note, when I presented Letter Factory in the same week, she was hooked to learning letters.In 2 weeks, she was able to recognize about 50% of the alphabet. This is amazing development from a child who has zero interest on letters. I will pick up a letter and she screams excitedly what letter it is. There are few occassions that she was sleeping then she screamed E F G then when I checked her, she was sleeping... LOL. Having this DVD for a month now, she can recognize letters from A to Z. When we read at night, she points to the capital letters in the book and name it to me. Same goes with numbers. She is starting to say the sound of the letters too.I rented at the local library some DVDs about alphabets (after the success of Letter Factory in our house) such as Brainy Baby, Meet the Letters, Babyscape etc etc -- they are also good but not great like Letter Factory. I let my child watch those to present the letters in different way. All the DVDs I named above have very similar presentation -- showing the letters, saying what letter it is and what sound(s) they make. Letter Factory on the otherhand is very creative in their presentation. The song is very catchy. One of those that sticks to your head. The way they teach the sound of the letter is very creative and funny for kids too like for example for letter &#34;A&#34;. Tad (the main character) went to the training room of Letter A then Professor Quigley (the one helping Tad learn the letters) put on a monster suit and said &#34;Booga Booga Booga&#34; to scare the Letter A and all the letter &#34;A&#34; along with Tad screamed &#34;AHHHH&#34; in fear. My daughter loves to scream with the letter A when they make their sound &#34;AHHHH&#34;. Now, 19-month she thinks sound of letter A is funny.What makes this DVD superior among others is the creative presentation -- not the typical fashion.Rating this a perfect 5 for all the reasons I named above but most importantly for delivering a proven result to my daughter.This DVD helped her and continue to do so.	5.0	The most creative and fun DVD for teaching letters	2013-05-24	1	1	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3ST08RHHOPDGE	Patty	We purchased this DVD to help our two and a half year old start learning her letters.  Some friends of ours recommended it, saying their kids had all learned their alphabet and each letters sound by watching it.  So far we haven't seen that in our daughter.  She watches the DVD a couple of times a week, but hasn't picked up her alphabet.  The music is catchy, but she tends to get bored about halfway through.  It's not the DVDs fault though - our daughter doesn't watch any TV for an extended period of time.  As a parent that watches it with her, I have to admit the songs and music tend to get a little tiring after the first few times, but if she learns her alphabet and phonics then it is well worth it.	4.0	Good learning DVD for toddlers	2012-07-18	1	1	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2XF2BCEMRAN2K	Paula	I got Letter Factory as part ofLeapFrog: Learning DVD Set- the whole set is good, but Letter Factory is pretty much the best thing on the market if you want your child to learn the alphabet.My son's were 1.5 and 3 years old when I got it for them. My 3 year old already knew the alphabet, so it was mostly a refresher for him. My 1.5 year old son really picked up on the alphabet from this dvd. I didn't have to do anything else. He naturally learned it on his own.If your child is between 1.5 and 3 years old, this is about as close to perfect as you get.I also got123 Count with Me/Learning About Lettersbut both sons hated it and wouldn't watch it at all.Now my one son is 2.5 year old has been watching a lot ofMeet the Sight Words Box Set (Meet the Sight Words 1, Meet the Sight Words 2, Meet the Sight Words 3)for the past 6 months and likes that a lot too.It's hard to go wrong with leapfrog dvd's.They're the best on the market and cheap too. Leapfrog Letter Factory should be mandatory for all kids and it'll make the parents lives a lot easier too. Definitely get the Sight Words set after your child learns the alphabet from Letter Factor.As your child moves on to learning how to read, you'll want to avoid Whole Word type programs where kids simply memorize words. Programs such as Your Baby Can Read: Early Language Development System may make you feel proud of your baby or child for picking out words he or she sees, but it's not making them a better reader and research seems to suggest it will hurt their reading progress.Now I should say, the Meet the Sight Words set is whole words learning, but that's an exception because some words just don't make sense with phonics so you'll need some sort of whole word program for those tricky words. But you don't want to rely totally on whole word as a reading program.So start with Letter Factory and then move on to phonics.	5.0	Every child under 3 should have this dvd, very educational	2011-07-03	0	0	0

I also purchased the talking words factory which is just as great as the letter factroy.  My son who is now in kindergarten is able to read and spell thanks to the help of leapfrog videos.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1K55YU3F5OTYA	"Pratik Mahajan ""Deepshikha Mahajan"""	I have a 3 year old son. he was good with his alphabet recognition and names since a very long time and i was wanting him to learn phonics and then eventually start reading, as he is crazily attracted to books.I had a concern that he very picky about what interests him and i certainly did not want phonics to be something he does'nt like learning. So it was important for me to make  acorrect choice of DVD which entertains him thorougly while making him learn.Leap frog letter factory gave him the perfect first introduction to  phonics. It clicked with him so well that he wants to watch it over and over again. To my  surprise he has already started sounding letters specilly the ones he like.Tedd and prof uigley actually visit the various letter rooms to learn the sounds. In these rooms the letters (from letter factory)are learning their own sounds. During each room visit, the letter sound is taught, prof quigley gives a few words starting from that sound, he also writes the letter on a slate (this helps children know how the letter is written and helps when they eventually learn writing), also the catchy jingle after every letter. The letters and sounds are repeated after every 4 new letters are taught. while in particular letter room, many words starting with that particular letter are deliberately used to give children a discreet sense of what the letter sounds like.The best part about this DVD is that they have made the most perfect pronunciation / sounds of letters, along with associting them with mnay real life situations, where you hear those sounds. hence it  becomes very easy for the child to associate the sound with something, rather than learning it as a stand sound of the letter. vowels which are particularly dificult to remember (soundwise) even for adults have been so beautifully sounded in the dvd, associating them with different things.for example the sound of a (as pronounced in apple) is taught as a response when someone scares you. It is funny for children to see tedd getting scared with the 'ae' sound and they instantly register it.similarly the sound of O is taught through a jungle theme, tarzan sound.Children can easily differentiate between sounds through these associations.To begin with you might find the DVD going fast from one letter to another but I think the sped is perfect for children, as if too much time is invetsed on each letter, children may loose interest. After watching it a few times you will find the speed appropriate.It is for me the bets way to teach phonics at home.	5.0	Best DVD for Phonics	2008-03-06	0	0	0

I would even hear him mumbling letters while he was laying down for a nap or at bedtime.Of course we work with him on his letters and sounds beyond this DVD and others, but he now knows all of the sounds in any order and can pick any letter out of a pile or on paper. Lowercase is still a work in progress, but I am very proud of him.We also picked up one of the 3 Disc DVD sets which had Numbers Ahoy, Amazing Amusement Park and some story related DVD.

I do not let them watch anything that isn't educational (ie noggin, PBS or Leap Frog). Thus, I pop this video in and they are singing along and lovin' life. My three year old will spot letters and quote the movie.  She's learned a great deal and is thus moving on to the Word Factory.That being said, for a generation of kids used to Shrek and similar animation, Leap Frog needs to move towards more advanced graphics to keep their audience.	4.0	dated animation, but fabulous content!	2006-12-06	0	0	0

For a change of pace - I put the DVD in for my 28 month old daughter.  She fell in love with it - and watched it 1x in the morning, and then again at night for 2 weeks in a row. She would say I want to watch the Letters.  She watched intently, then one day as we were out and about - she pointed to a sign and said that's the letter ""H"".  And she was right.  She then proceeded to tell me the sound the letter ""H"" makes.  Originally, I thought she knew about 4 or 5 of her letters.  Turns out - she knows all but 4 or 5 of her letters, and the sound each makes.  She will point out letters on the computer keyboard by name.  I didn't have intention of teaching her letters - at 28 months - I put in the DVD - because a New DVD with Music - can often catch her attention long enough for me to make breakfast or pack lunches.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A11QEQWKLDM8U	Reviewer	"OK.  I'm a believer.  My (just turned) two-year-old son knew absolutely NOTHING about the alphabet before this video.  In fact, when we tried to teach him things, he seemed somewhat disinterested.However, on his very first viewing of this video, he began repeating the letter sounds with the characters on the video.  He sat completely spellbound watching the program in its entirety and then begged to watch it over and over again, each time becomming more and more involved in making the letter sounds.  It was like a light came on for him and he now is excited to learn and to use his new found knowledge.We've only had the video for a couple of months now and he almost knows his entire alphabet and can spell his name.  He can read letters on signs.  It's just amazing.Other reviews speak to the content, so I'll leave it at our personal testimonial.  We highly recommend this and all the Leapfrog ""Letter Factory"" products."	5.0	THIS REALLY WORKS!	2005-09-27	1	1	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AAC7835GSW5N5	R. Finks	Our daughter was given this movie at like 15 months.  We were told to just try it out.  We procrastinated and didn't start showing it to her until about 19 months.  At 20 months we were at a store and our daughter started naming the letters on the various signs.  WOW.  At two years old she could identify all letters and make their sounds.  She had the lower case letters down shortly after.  I recommend introducing this video at about 15-24 months. Then introduce them to Phonics Farm and Math adventure to the Moon at about 2 years. You will have the smartest kid in preschool, seriously.	5.0	An educational movie kids LOVE!	2012-11-14	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2P07DRGFFYD2M	Robinbanks	This is perfect to help kids understand what the different sounds that letters make are and to give them a nice jump start and introductory into reading. I bought this for my two year old and in no time at all, he knew what sound every letter of the alphabet made. He was speech delayed when we decided to buy this, hoping it would help. Boy did it! He was talking when he was two, but his pronunciation of words was off. He has learned so much from this dvd. He can sound out every letter when trying to read, and has been spelling words on his own for over a year (he is 3 1/2 now). He is no longer speech delayed, and I really believe it is because of this dvd. Learning what sounds different letters make has given him the understanding of what sounds to use when he is speaking words. If he pronounced pop as bop, I would simply tell him that pop started with a p and ask him what the p says, and he would then say the word correctly. Now his speech is all caught up and he is advanced with reading and spelling words!! I couldn't ask for more than that from a dvd!!	5.0	Turn that speech delay right around!!

As a first grade teacher, I was quite skeptical about whether a DVD could teach letter sounds but within 1 week of viewing the DVD twice a day, my 2 y.o. son knew all of them!  The letter sounds are presented in context of a song (to the tune of ""Farmer in the Dell"") and a fun story.  Kudos to Leap Frog for creating something entertaining for little ones AND educationally sound.  My son requests this DVD regularly and is now trying to put letter sounds together.  Thanks to this DVD and other phonemic awareness games, he's well on his way to reading CVC words.  I think we'll try ""Word Factory"" next."	5.0	Learning letter sounds in 1 week	2007-10-13	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1V4GSAWWTVF5Y	R. Williams	"At first, I got very excited about how effective this DVD seemed to be working on my son and was all set to give this DVD five stars.  The reason I thought that the video worked is because after my son had watched the video for three weeks, he could recite letters and letter sounds because he was mimicking the songs he heard in the video.  I picked up one of his alphabet board books that introduce upper and lowercase letters simultaneously, he did great with identifying most of the letters, so I thought, ""Woo hoo! My son knows almost all of his letters and he just turned four!""The problem is that I purchased a set of lower case plastic letters to help reinforce what my son learned.  When my son was younger, I tried without success to get him to learn all of his letters without the aid of videos.  Before this video, he only firmly knew a few.  After a few weeks of this video, I was surprised and a little disappointed to find that my son only knew a handful of the lowercase letters.  He misidentified or simply didn't know any of the other lowercase letters. I am satisfied with the start this video gave him and the progress he made, but I simply can't celebrate, rest on my laurels, and move on if he is not firm in those letters.The reason him not knowing all of the lowercase letters is a big deal is because anyone who has a child or has had a child in kindergarten knows that your child mostly learns lowercase letters in K and is asked to apply the knowledge of those lowercase letters in school.  If you personally are home-schooling, then obviously your child can learn the letters at their own pace, but not so if they are in school.  Your child is tested often (in most public schools, anyway) on that knowledge of lowercase letters and is expected to know some sight words involving lowercase letters in school.  If you are a Generation X-er, Kindergarten is not the way it was in the early eighties where it is okay for a five-year-old to mostly know uppercase letters; the standards have changed.  A lot more is expected of your son or daughter.  Your child will not got an A for effort if he or she knows primarily uppercase letters.  Every parent that is going, ""My child knows all the letters after only one week of watching Leapfrog Letter Factory!""  I ask you to thoroughly test your child on all lowercase letters not accompanied by their uppercase partners - out of order! - before you come to this conclusion.Besides, as a few reviewers correctly pointed out most books are written in lowercase letters and it is a little easier for your child to pick up reading well after K if they are firm in their knowledge of the lowercase letters.I think that if you have effectively introduced your child to lowercase letters and then you are using this video to reinforce those letters your child knows, that's different.  That said I think what's most important is that your child will have good phonemic awareness of all the letters after watching this video several times and know some of their lowercase letters, especially lowercase letters that look like the uppercase letters, c, p, o, k, u, v, w, x, y, z, etc.Another point I want to make about this video is the style in which it is presented. I am one of those parents that do let my kids watch cartoons and this particular LeapFrog DVD is very much like the cartoons my kids enjoy, so it did engage them.  If you don't let your child watch much TV or hardly any cartoons and want a learning video without a zany cartoon plot and kind of eccentric characters, this is probably not the video for you or your child.  Or if you yourself are kind of conservative and prefer characters who are a little more sedate and pious to help teach your little one their letters, then you probably will not like this video for your child.Otherwise, I can only recommend this video for reinforcement of what you or another medium has already taught your child in the way of lowercase letters."	3.0	Works for Capital letters	2012-03-13	2	2	0

My 3 year old and 15 month old love it.  My 3 year old already knows her letters and most of the sounds, but this has boosted her knowledge of letter sounds, and it's been a good supplement to my 15 month old's introduction to letters.  (I also bought the word DVD for my 3 yo.)  It's great at holding the girls attention, too.My only complaint is that they don't teach the different sounds some of the letters make.  For example, it teaches that the A says ""Ahhh"", but neglects the hard ""A"" sound.  So she has to be reminded that some of the letters make more sounds than what are shown, but of course that's what Mommies are for!"	5.0	GREAT product!!	2010-01-10	0	0	0

I bought this at the recommendation of another mom at Walmart when we were looking at the Leap Frog books for Leap Pad.  My daughter is two, but I bought it anyway because we prefer educational videos and there aren't alot for her age.  To my surprise she asked for ""frogs"" quite a bit.  One day while giving my second daughter her bottle and reading a NORA ROBERTS novel simultaneously, my two year old walked up, tapped the outside of my book and said ""O"".  My imagination or lucky guess for her, right?  I tapped the next letter she said ""R"".  I tapped the ""A"" and she got it again!  Imagine my excitement!  ""Maddie, what's this one?"" And you guessed it, she spelled out R-O-B-E-R-T-S!  I had never worked on letters with her prior to this, she learned it entirely on her own, from the video!  She was two, I had no idea she would be able to self-learn so successfully.  Now we own the LF Word Factory and Math Circus and she enjoys them all very much.  She loves the refrigerater set, enjoys playing with the letters while I work in the kitchen.  She can almost sing the entire alphabet song on her own.  I've taught her to write the easiest letters, O and L and I, and we are working on the rest.  These videos are truelly amazing.  They are entertaining - she LOVES to watch them - and she still enjoys them at almost age 3.  As a bonus - they are not expensive!  Cheaper than Barney (who she loves) and Disney.(Bonus for me?

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2VKIE9TKEY76B	"Sara E. Lefler ""sarabeth0720"""	So, I have a very intelligent 5 yr old who just always picks things up without much work.  Then I have a 3 yr old who I would say is the normal 3 yr old.  She knew a few letters here and there, actually only 2 really. I know 3 yr olds aren't SUPPOSED to recognize their whole alphabet, but when you have a 5 yr old who knew all the letter and sounds at 3, it can be a little tough as a parent. I know they are completely different people, but still. Well I would work on letters every single day for a few minutes with my 3 yr old, and she would show NO interest, and never remember what we went over. Well I took advice from another reviewer, and I just have this playing constantly in the car. Okay I bought this TWO weeks ago, and she recognizes EVERY single letter now, and the sounds they make. This video is AMAZING!!! BUY IT!	5.0	Words cannot explain how awesome this is!	2012-04-20	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1NE30GGRDET4D	Sarah Harkins	The movie is great, but this dvd is very poor quality. Almost like it's a cheap reproduction. I even question whether or not it's a legal reproduction because you can skip the FBI warning like you can skip any of the previews. I've never had a DVD where that is allowed.It doesn't work sometimes and it's not because it's been scratched or anything. It freezes and sometimes won't play.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1GJECGWE8XITL	sfagrad	My child knew the alphabet very early on, but at 3 I tried to start teaching him the sounds that each letter made and he was not very interested in me doing this.  I purchased this video in hopes that it would be a little more fun and educational at the same time.  It was.  It did not take him long to learn the sounds of the letters and he loved watching this video!  I recommend this video to anyone trying to teach the alphabet, or the sounds of them.  I passed our video along to a family whose oldest was in Pre-K learning the alphabet, and there were two younger siblings at home.  I sent this video over to help the oldest and thinking the younger ones might aid from it too.  They did!  The parents loved this video as much as I did.	5.0	Great Tool for Learning Sounds	2010-11-04	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3VT3JX84IJTWJ	Shannon	This DVD is not one of the better learning tools out there.  The audio and visuals are overstimulating and distracting from the message, the story line is contrived and hard for little ones to follow and the characters pronounce the letters incorrectly in many cases.I can see that it might be entertaining for some kids, if they are used to fast pace animation and the unfortunate jump-cut editing pervasive in children's programming.  But my 2.5-year-old was bored with it and didn't want to watch it again.  He enjoys story-based programs (Curious George, Little Polar Bear, etc.) and lesson-based programs (Brainy Baby ABCs), so it's not a matter of his not being able to follow along.  I think it was just too much unnecessary noise and action.	2.0	Visually overstimulating, contrived story and phonemic mistakes	2009-06-27	12	7	5

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3ACTSTWFBQAXT	Sherri Croom	If I ever only recommended one learning DVD to a parent of a preschooler - this would be it. We are very careful not to let our children watch a lot of tv. But this DVD is truly beneficial to young preschoolers. I recommend it to every mother and preschool director I meet. It teachers letter recognition and letter sounds through a cute story and catchy tune. And while it focuses on upper-case letters, it also shows the lower-case letters. This DVD will quickly teach young children the main sound each letter makes. It doesn't teach long-vowel sounds and some of the exceptions - but these can be taught at a later age. Parents can easily add other activities to their child's day to supplement letter learning and letter sounds.When we bought this DVD our daughter was 25 months old, and our son was 17 months old. Just to give you some background - both of our children are adopted and are not biologically related. Our daughter already knew all her letters and within 2-3 viewings could tell us every letter sound. After watching about 3 times a week over the course of the first month our son knew every letter sound. And so by 18 months old, he knew all his letter sounds also. We reinforced letter learning and letter sounds daily - we worked on puzzles together, asked them to find the letters, and tell us the sound. We sang the song in this DVD while we traveled in the car. And we took other opportunities in the day to reinforce what they were learning.When our daughter turned three and half we jumped ahead to Section 3 in The Ordinary Parent's Guide to Teaching Reading and started on learning to read words. She very easily transitioned to this phonics-based home program (which I also love) and is doing great. She is half-way through the book now and is reading at a second grade level; she is four years old. She is bringing me books through the day to read to me, and taking them when we ride in the car. She is quickly becoming an avid reader. Our son watched as we worked on her reading skills. And he is picking it up even faster. While she was sounding out words - he was already blending them and putting them together at age two. They are both on the way to becoming great readers.This DVD is one of the absolute best buys for a preschool child. I would recommend for ages 18 months to 3 years old. Add some interactive parenting and this DVD works great.	5.0	Every Preschooler Needs This Learning DVD	2012-03-26	0	0	0

I bought this for my 6 months old son, because I read another review similar to my specifics. Although it initially got the attention of my son, it took only a few plays for him to get totally bored. Plus, the manner of teaching the letters are confusing and 'crowdy'  to a baby younger than 18 months; and thus NOT recommended for a baby this age.  I also did not like the incorrect pluralization of the word ""Fish""...as ""Fishes"". Yes, this may sound like a picky point, but  I have known children to develop this incorrect pluralization of the word and its hard to get them to understand the difference."	3.0	Not Appropriate for Under 18  Months	2011-10-12	6	0	6

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AGFW667QNHDOY	S. Lipson	"I have this video and the Talking Words Factory also. I like this one better. It does a great job at cleverly illustrating and animating each letter in a ""letter themed"" focus- chattering frozen cold C's; vibrating V's, hissing S's in school, karate kicking K's, jumping J's, flying F's... you get the idea. There is also a brief illustration (chalk on chalk board) of how to write each letter as it is covered. I have both the my first leap pad and traditional leap pads for my 3 & 4 yr old boys. I was terribly disappointed that they didn't play with them as much as I thought or hoped they would. However, after getting these videos they have had a lasting burst of renewed interest in both formats of Leap pads because they now recognize and are familar with the leap frog family characters.

Just in the past month his language has exploded and this DVD has taught him all of the letters and what sound they make.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1Y0TBS87NI3QA	S. Manhertz	My son just turned 3 and this is his most requested video. After watching it only a few times I noticed a significant improvement in his letter recognition skills and since introducing it he has started to ask (frequently!) about the letters that make up words. We will be trying another video in the Leap Frog series soon, as this one was quite impressive.	5.0	Fun and educational	2009-10-14	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1GNMHJPWPG2AM	Smart Shopper	You don't need another review since there are 1,083 already, so I'll make this one short. The Letter Factory works for my child, too. It's very intelligently made with catchy little songs and mnemonic devices that carry over to the Talking Words Factory  and the Code Word Caper to help children remember the sounds of the letters. My husband even laughs at the jokes and enjoys watching it with our son.	5.0	It really works	2012-10-29	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	AS0GU55HIYN08	S. Nash	I love this video, and the other ones made by Leap Frog. I taught kindergarten last year and I had six kids that just weren't learning their letters and sounds. I sent each child home with this video in April and within a month, only one of the students didn't know all of their letters and sounds. They all made huge learning gains. I knew that it had worked with my own children, but I hadn't tried it with students until last year. This year I am teaching 1st Grade and I am sending the video home with a couple of students again. I am very excited to see the results.	5.0	Really Works!	2008-12-08	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3A0WBBMHALJXK	Somewhere in Cali	This DVD is by far the most effective educational program we have ever owned.  It teaches letters and their sounds in a fun, entertaining way that holds a child's attention.All three of my kids have learned from it, but I am most impressed with how much my youngest has learned.  He's almost 3 now and he knows all his letters by sight and there phonetic sounds.  But he knew the phonetic sounds far earlier...by the time his second birthday rolled around.My 4-year-old knows the names and sounds of the letters as well and is already starting to sound out words.  He won't enter kindergarten until '07 (as his birthday is in Nov) so he should be reading quite well by then.Now I know this isn't that incredible.  Kids their ages are doing this all over the world.  But as much as I adore my children, I am not a very patient person.  So I have not spent nearly as much time as I should working with them on these skills. I have to give Leapfrog most of the credit.I highy recommend this DVD.  All Leapfrog's DVDs are great, but this is definitely been the most effective.	5.0	By the time he was 2, my son knew his letter sounds!	2006-03-10	0	0	0

They aren't able to play the game without my help since you have to use the remote (we play ours on the TV but, you can play it on the computer as well).

It took forever to get going and my son just about lost interest before it got to the letter sounds.  My just 2 year old will watch part of it (huge for him). He's learned so much from us and from the leap frog magnet letter set, that this is just a reinforcement.

She knew all of her letters before she was two and within a week of getting this video she knew most of the letter sounds!  She is now two years two months old and knows ALL the sounds and I give most of the credit to this video and the Fridge Phonics.  She can also tell you what letter words start with!

He loves his DVD about the letters and in fact he is learning to pronounce the letters every day. His favorite is the letter ""M"" specially when we are eating in the kitchen. I like that it gives the child a chance to see many class rooms and the satisfaction of learning in the end. A must have!. We bought it along with the ""Word Whammer"" toy and I also got the fridge phonics in spanish...so my only complain is how come they didnt have the DVD in Spanish?? Obiously, if they make the phonics in Spanish then they should have the DVD in Spanish...it makes sense. So it should have both languages on the DVD."	4.0	Perfect DVD but needs Spanish!!!!	2006-07-12	3	3	0

I've spent hundreds of dollars on toys, dvd's and other systems to help my child read. Although my daughter is only two, I've always put a lot of emphasis on her education. I bought the ""My Baby Can Read system"" and this DVD, by far, outweighs all the benefits of my baby can read. Why? Because it's almost effortless. All you have to do is put the DVD on and they're hooked. My two yo knows her ABC's from A-Z and, I learned today, that she can IDENTIFY the letters when asked, on a chart. I was amazed; I didn't even know she could do that! For under $10, I have laid down a great foundation for my child and I could not be more proud."	5.0	The absolute best	2011-03-17	1	1	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	ABPBZ5W91YTHY	Stephanie Druley McDowell	A friend of mine recommended this DVD when I mentioned my 4 yo was having difficulty learning the different letter sounds.  This is a short cartoon that holds your child's interest.  I loved the technique of showing them the letters and incorporating a catchy tune which for each which helps them remember what sound each letter makes (example R is a racecar making rrr sounds when it goes fast). One of my sons favorite parts is the last one in which he gets to play a letter game - they give him the sound the letter makes and he uses the remote to highlight that letter.  Great reinforcement and you can skip the other part of the video and go directly to this section if you want.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A23RCAS3DH5555	Stephen	My kids love this video. It started with my 4 year old and now my 2 year old can't get enough of it.  My wife saw this at the library and borrowed it.  The kids wanted to rent it every time they went to the library.  I decided to pick it up from Amazon so we wouldn't have to worry about someone else borrowing it and not being able to borrow it ourselves.Besides the kids loving it...I love it.  My two year old walks around the house and when he sees letters anywhere he will start to make the letter sounds.  He can also put together a letter puzzle with very little help. So, he is actually learning something from this video.  The wife and I don't like letting the kids watch TV too much, but at least with this video they are learning while being entertained....can't say that about many other cartoons and kid shows.  Sure some kid shows teach things, but they don't teach the whole alphabet in a half hour.I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to entertain and teach their kids at the same time.	5.0	My kids love it...Entertaining and Educational	2013-03-08	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1D8LBOS4Y9CHQ	Sterling	"My daughter somehow got through preschool with out learning all her letters and almost no letter sounds.  She had little to no interest in learning these concepts.  She hated being read abc books and loathed the ""Word World"" cartoon.  During her first month of kindergarten my sister gave me the ""Letter Factory"" dvd and, to my pleasant surprise, my daughter watched the entire thing!  The next morning she asked to watch it again. When it was over she asked to replay it.  She asked to watch the ""Letter Factory"" video at least twice a day for the rest of the week. And then she was done.  She knew ALL the letters and ALL the sounds. She didn't want to (or need to) watch the dvd again.I am a credentialed teacher and tried many times over the years to help with her pre-reading skills, but her intense lack of interest (and out right refusal!) quickly ended all my attempts.  Lucky for both of us I had seen first hand that reading is a very developmental skill and doesn't need to be forced; lucky for me I had a wonderful tool, ""Letter Factory,"" available just when she was ready!"	5.0	like kindergarten on TV	2011-01-05	2	2	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3E7234AO44T8R	"Tammy ""american_mommy"""	I got this specifically for my almost 5 yr old daughter because she will be starting school in the fall.  But my 2 yr old and almost 7 yr old both love it too.  My daughter has gotten better with her sounds and is more interested in learning new letters and their sounds. My son goes around saying the letter sounds and, for my oldest, I think it helps reinforce the sounds she has already learned as she learns to read more.  I have had this recommended by many people and it is definitely worth it. I am so glad we decided to go this way, we also have the Talking Words Factory, my oldest daughter seems to like that one the most, and the Math Circus, again,my oldest likes that one more than the other two. It seems the 2 yr old and 4 yr old are more into the Letter Factory. I am very happy about it though as it is really teaching them about the sounds of the letters in a fun way.  It is something I don't mind letting them watch because I feel they are actually learning something. My daughter knew her abc's before but now she is going around saying the sounds of words she always uses and I find myself singing the songs with them at odd times of the day!  I am planning on getting the game also as it was recommended.  This is one of the dvds that is really good for little ones as well as a little bit older.	5.0	All 3 of my kids love this dvd!	2006-02-21	0	0	0

My daughter recieved this video at 14 months and started imitating the letter sounds almost instantly.  By 16 months I could ask her what any letter of the alphabet made and she nailed it each and everytime.  She recently turned 18 months old and can now recognize each letter.  I write them out for her and she can tell me what each letter is.  It is so wonderful to have products like this out.  I thought she would be to small for this at first, but Leap Frog proved us wrong,  I wish there was one for learning numbers which is what were working on now.	5.0	Absolutely INCREDIBLE	2004-08-09	0	0	0

We drove up to JC Penny one day and he said ""P pu popcorn"". I was amazed. So I tested him by saying each letter and asking him to make the sound and he knew all of them! My friends were stunned, he knew his letter sounds better than the little girl who lives next door that is two years older.He's now three, and he still enjoys watching the movie, singing and saying the sounds along with the movie. He also has theLeapFrog Leapster Educational Video: The Letter Factory, which is another favorite. He would sit and watch the whole thing, again when he was only two.I also likeLeapFrog Fridge Phonics Magnetic Set, which reinforces everything from the movie, and is actually a little better as it gives dual sounds when appropriate.Another toy they make that I love isLeapFrog Explorer Smart Globe.

IT GETS THEM EXCITED ABOUT THE LETTERS AND LEARNING TO READ.  THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL LOVE IT!THIS DVD IS THE FIRST DVD OF THE ORIGNAL LEAPFROG SERIES- produced to help children gain reading skills starting out with the ABC's and learning their sounds.  THE VIDEO IS VERY ENGAGING AND CHILDREN LOVE THE ENERGY OF IT'S PRESENTATION!My granddaughter started watching this as soon as she showed interest in TV.  Her Mom let her watch a DVD of this series until she was so solid in the material presented and she was thouroughly grounded in all the information that series had to offer before she went to the Next DVD.BY THE AGE OF 2, SHE WAS READING!  The FIRST LEAPFROG SERIES IS THE BEST- START WITH THAT ONE, IT HAS MORE INFORMATION PRESENTED.  THE 2ND SERIES IS GOOD TO START AFTER YOU CHILD IS COMPLETELY SOLID IN THE FIRST SERIES.  THE NEWER-2ND SERIES IS GOOD FOR A REVIEW, IT HAS SOME OTHER INFORMATION AND STORY BUT IT IS NOT AS GROUNDING IN READING SKILLS AS THE FIRST SERIES!  AMAZON CARRIES BOTH LEAPFORG DVD SERIES.NETFLICKS HAS THESE 2 SERIES BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS ONE DVD, THE FIRST DVD OF THE FIRST SERIES-WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DVD TO START OUT WITH - THIS ONE HERE: LEAPFROG LETTER FACTORY!I BUY THIS SERIES FOR EVERY CHILD I KNOW! at Walmart for $9 dollars (NO LONGER AVAILBLE AT WALMART)- So I HUNTED DOWN THIS FIRST DVD AND FOUND IT FOR LESS AT AMAZON!.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3X3VQV4S5MWJ	"Tha Queen Bee ""2BiizziiBeez"""	I've bought everything.. DVD's, books, games anything to help my son learn his letters. The thing I like about this DVD that's different from the other learning DVD's is that it's set up to look like a real cartoon, not just jumping to A IS FOR APPLE, B IS FOR BUTTERFLY etc. I was skeptical about buying it since none of the other DVD's have worked, nor have the hundreds of alphabet books we own, so I just went ahead and bought the letter factory, talking words factory and word factory 2 along with math circus (wich is nowhere NEAR as good as the other 3). After 1 week of watching this video once a day he learned alot of the alphabet and the letter sounds. As of now, 2wks after purchasing it, he knows all but 4 letters by sight. I also bought the letter factory game to go along with the DVD and to give him time away from TV while still learning his alphabet and the letter sounds. The game is great because it's basic enough for a 2yo to play it but it also has 2 levels for more advance play. On level one you have to find the card color and on level 2 you have to find the actual letter. I HIGHLY recommend this movie AND the letter factory game to go along with it (Kohls.com has an exclusive game tin that I like better than the cardboard box).	5.0	After 2 wks my 2.5 yo knows his letters and their sounds!!!!	2005-01-05	12	11	1
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A2PM3BVT9TWZM2	tharp	We bought this DVD to use as a tool to help our son to learn sounds and letters. He has been slow to talk so we watch this DVD with him and encourage him to make the sounds. We select the scene where they start with the letters and skip the intro- it's a little wordy. He loves the letters and has started making some of the sounds! He wants to watch it over and over again. Very cute and fun.Update:: we have been watching the DVD together for over 2 months now and our son can recognize all of the letters and can make most of the sounds (Q, R, S are hard!). It's amazing! It has really helped him with speech and it's fun to watch him master these letters and sounds!

Our 4 yo son who has a June birthday is in his second year of preschool, was not learning the letters and honestly had no interest. He also had a speech delay. His preschool teacher said in October that she would wait to test his ABC's till January to decide if we needed to hold him back 1 year from kindergarten because he needed to know at minimum 10 letters, but that they prefer 13 letter and 13 sounds.  After only 2 weeks of watching this on a daily basis my son was able to sing the entire alphabet song and could identify at least 10 or more letters.  Then on January 3 my birthday, my son identified 26 letters and 26 sounds as a my gift.

In fact, this became my daughter's favorite video from the first time she watched it.For younger children I suggest forwarding it straight to where it begins teaching the letters.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1YALIR02Z7HOV	ToddlerNoah	I bought this for my son when he was 17 months old - about 3 weeks ago. I must say I am impressed. I let him watch this everyday in the morning and now he knows most of the sounds of the alphabet except for N, R, V, W, X, Y, Z (which I think are really difficult). He says the sound of the F and Q with difficulty, but he tries.He gets excited when he sees me taking the DVD out of the case and he really is happy to see the movie. It's very engaging.Now, wherever we go, he would just randomly say a letter he sees like A when he sees Staircase A in Church, or D for the word Drop Off in the Pharmacy, or when we go shopping and he sees big letter signs. This is a great tool for learning and he really loves it. We got him an alphabet puzzle when he was 6 months old and he suddenly took an interest in it after watching The Letter Factory. Of course, complemented with this are reading books to your child, using flashcards and magnetic alphabets. Leapfrog has done a good job with this one!	5.0	Good learning tool!	2012-04-06	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1J64Q8XTUUIIY	topbook	My 4 year old son, just didn't get phonics. A neighbor and a another woman I met told me about these. I bought both the letter and talking word factory. And bam! Within days, my son was sounding out letters, and even started to read this weekend. I catch him pointing to words on signs, and even for instance, ketchup bottles, he is naming the letters and saying the sounds. He used to cry he couldn't read like his sister, now he is learning. These videos have been a such a gift to us. If you have a boy that is having difficulties. Here is your answer to your prayers.	5.0	Finally	2004-11-07	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1JZYYLXAOJEUD	TotMom	"I am a mom who doesn't care for electronic toys and wants my child to operate the toy train on his own. I'm not a big fan of sticking your kid down in front of the television to ""teach"" them things.  That being said, after months of working with my child showing him various letters and trying him to get to repeat just one of them back to me, I was frustrated.  He had NO interest in trying to do the letter puzzles or play with any of the learning toys I had bought him.I bought this dvd to try to supplement what I was doing and we sat and watched it one time.  After the first time we watched it, he ran into the other room and grabbed the letter puzzle that I'd been trying to push on him and wanted to play with it, asking me what each letter was!  After a few times of watching it, he would happily point out letters as we were out an about, telling me what the letter was and what sound it made!! He picked up SOOO much from this video and it got him interested in the alphabet! I have since purchased several more Leap Frog videos because I think they are a great starting point to get children interested in learning!"	5.0	Great way to learn the alphabet	2012-01-05	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A64TYOX5J1TFK	Valerie	"I used this DVD in my Pre-Kindergarten class for years. I discovered it one summer during summer school when another teacher was using it. I am not a video teacher so I thought ""no way"". But I noticed her test scores for letter and sound recognitions where through the roof! Well the next summer I bought it and wanted to see what it could do for my students, since they are only there for 18 days, I needed all the help I could get! Well, it WORKED!!! I had students who had been in Pre-K an entire year and knew no letters, leave my class knowing 17 letters and 20 sounds. It was a joint effort between class work and the DVD, but I know a lot of it was the DVD. It gave me the time to work with small groups while the other students watched the video. It was like having another teacher. I have since bought it for my 2 year old son and he knows almost all of the letters and their sounds.

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1XW0SA2MCUE94	VaMommie	Maybe my daughter is just a bit too young for this video (13 months), but she doesn't really seem very interested in it at all.  I will continue to play it once a week or so, so that it's on in the background while we play, as I'm hoping she'll get more interest later.Overall, I was surprised by the lower quality of animation.  It seems like an older cartoon.  Her favorite show (and pretty much only thing she watches for 30 minutes each day) is Super Why on PBS, and I was expecting it to look more like that...but, maybe my expectations were just unrealistic?In sum, I'm hoping she will come around to liking it as she gets older because it seems like a great way to learn her letters and corresponding sounds.	3.0	Good for learning sounds, but lower quality cartoon	2013-07-19	1	0	1

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A3G42PNWASLGE8	VA native	"The video's best asset to me is that it gets to the actual learning quickly, after just a few minutes setting up the plot. The plot in a nutshell- Young Tad wants to learn the alphabet so Professor Quigly takes him from room to room in the talking letter factory and each letter does a short demonstration of the sounds it makes. (The vowels do short vowel sounds only.)  There is a quick musical review after every few letter sounds Tad learns. Effective.Buy Leapfrog Fridge phonics and this dvd together and along with your own reading they will definately help your child learn letters and letter sounds. Fridge Phonics is geared towards auditory learners (kids who learn best through listening) and kinesthetic learners (kids who learn best through touching and doing). They manipulate the letters and the toy sounds them out. The video caters to visual learners.I'm no teacher, but I believe the two toys work so amazingly because they cover so many types of learners. Most kids are probably a combination, but many have one style that just doesn't work. Example: I recommended this toy to my sister (a teacher) for my then two year old nephew who is anything but auditory. My sister says ""He just doesn't want to hear it."" He received this for Christmas and learned his letters in days!"	5.0	A perfect compliment to Fridge Phonics	2006-02-09	0	0	0

This sequence repeats for each letter, but the there is also a larger storyline that overarches the introduction to the letter sounds. Quite wonderful!!My 3-year-old loves to watch the movie and then act it out. Just the other day, he wanted to play the part of the professor, so he sang the song for each letter, ""The `B' says..."". He would pause, expecting me to fill in the blank with the correct sound. Much to my surprise (and delight), my 15-month-old piped in with the correct sound for each letter!! I didn't expect this dvd to be that effective!If you are going to watch movies with your young ones, I highly recommend this one.Only one criticism: unlike some other Leapfrog products, like the Imagination Desk, this movie only covers a single sound for each letter. The long vowel sounds and the soft consonant sounds are left out."	5.0	Don't wait! Even young viewers can benefit from this movie!	2004-02-19	4	3	1

My son learned his letters and their sounds in weeks after watching this video.  He can name them in any alphabet book, finds them everywhere we go, and has even started to write them on his Aquadoodle.

The beginning to way to loon for my son, that is why I skip it. I would give it 5 stars, except some of the rponunciation of letters is incorrect. Especially for the letter L (where did they get the UULL sound?). There are a few more letter, like O, M, N, R, but they are not as profound as L.Other than that, great DVD. I am also getting my son Fridge phonics set, so he can play with lettes and still hear the familiar song.	4.0	Good addition to teaching phonemic awareness	2007-11-12	0	0	0
B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A20ACO4A77OHZK	"Yvonne Hickman ""thebratchild"""	This video and all the Leap Frog videos are outstanding. My 6 year old daughter was having problems learning to read. She was bored- so my sister suggested these videos... We now have 4 and love them ALL...On school nights my children have to be in bed by 8, but we prefer that they fall asleep to educational shows and these were the perfect fit. My 3 year old has even memorized all the songs!My daughter is doing much better with her reading and her teacher has introduced the videos in class now.WTG Leap Frog with another Fabulous idea for our children!!!	5.0	Leap Frog is The Best!!!!	2008-04-05	0	0	0

B0000INU6S	LeapFrog: Letter Factory	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Z Hayes	I have been playing this on and off since last year...and my 2 year old can not only identify all the letters of the alphabet but she is beginning to sound them out too. Phonics are essential to teaching reading, and this is an excellent teaching tool, that is fun to watch, has adorable characters like little Tad, and the letters all have catchy little tunes to introduce the sounds they make.	5.0	Excellent introduction to phonics	2007-03-14	0	0	0
