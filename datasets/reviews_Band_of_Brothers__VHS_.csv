B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	ATN8IGOY7F80O	3 cat mama	The world is losing World War 2 vets at an exponential rate.  WW2 vets chose to go home, go to work and take care of their children without speaking about the horrors they endured.  They perceive those who died on the battlefield as the heroes.  The downside of this is the kids of today need to know of this sacrifice before any history revisionists have the opportunity to do damage to the truth.	5.0	Necessary education!	2014-06-02	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1P3JR1D86XG2L	"Abel Martinez ""Adrianrulz"""	This was something I had in mind all along when I was contemplating switching over to the blu-ray format.  Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, and HBO outdid themselves with this mini-series on the exploits of the 101st Airborne in World War II.  The acting is great and the story is moving, as it pays an homage to the real paratroopers from WW2.  What made the series memorable was that it had real vets being interviewed from the unit being depicted in the series.  You can tell that Hanks/Spielberg and company put in a lot of TLC into this project.  The box set is in a catchy tin package with extras like Journals and insight into the training the actors received for authenticity. The blu-ray quality is outstanding too.  This is a must have for any WW2/war movie buffs and any Army airborne personnel.	5.0	Airborne all the way	2010-03-15	2	2	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3GA6VQPAVDIS0	Abhijit I. Karmokar	I had purchased the DVD version of Band of Brothers after I saw a few episodes from my roommates' DVD set. I was blown away with the story and the amazing script. The moment I realized that they were coming out with the Blu Ray version I promptly sold my DVD version and pre-ordered this set on Amazon. The advantages over the DVD version are as follows1. 1080p full HD quality2. DTS-HD Master Audio3. English Subtitles (the DVD one had only Spanish)4. Tons of extras like PIP commentary, Interactive guides and maps ...For me these were good enough reasons to own this masterpiece !!I have this set today in my hands !! Great packaging ... more or less like the DVD version .. just bit smaller !!Amazing A/V quality !!! Way better than the DVD version of course !!Conclusion: Must have even for a casual enthusiast ... and an absolute must for those hardcore fans !! Go get it !!

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A30BGG3037GGNE	abookluvr	Other reviews sum up this production pretty well and explain the historical background more in-depth, but overall it's a fascinating story about comrades in arms during WWII.  Gritty and realistic, this is not for viewers who can't handle a little gore. That said, it is very moving and really makes you think about war and the sacrifices that people must make.  I watched it all in just a few days! Definitely recommended.	5.0	Excellent but gritty WWII story	2013-05-20	1	1	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	A. Burchfield	I watched this one a while back and was very impressed with the level of detail and just about everything else in this production. Band of Brothers follows the lives of a group of young men from just before D Day through the end of the war and really doesn't hold anything back. Everything is shown in detail, must've cost a medium sized fortune to achieve that. Often we are taken along as though we are actually there on the battlefield, or at least a newscameraman was, no details left out including bloody wounds and exploding buildings from artillery fire. I'd reccommend this program to just about anyone with an interest in history or warfare.	4.0	Very detailed look at war, will be  one for your collection	2002-10-05	8	4	4

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A12WYZYJCJZ78M	A Buyer	This is the only TV I have ever seen that is as good as Terminator: the Sarah Connor Chronicles.  it's better than TSCC because B of B has the advantage of being historical.You won't be able to stop watching it.  The first one or two episodes might be a little draggy but, once the soldiers get out of boot camp, wow!  I watched the entire series breathlessly on TV...and I still bought the CD. What does that tell you? I also bought Sarah Connor.  These two are the only tv shows I have *ever* bought so I could enjoy rewatching them.  They are the only shows I have ever rewatched.This will appeal especically to people who like historical shows.  And if you have children old enough to watch war movies you should make sure they see this. Then they will understand exactly what America did in 1941-45, what an achievement it was and how it came about that Western Civilization earned the freedom we have now.	5.0	Band of Brothers	2010-04-23	4	1	3

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A20DYHWCPG3P3O	Achau211	This is one of the best, if not THE best WWII film I've ever seen.  The series was perfectly cast with wonderfully talented actors.  I loved the fact that they closely worked with most of the men from Easy Co., which contributed to the authenticity of the series.  It's an amazing way to immortalize these brave men - what a great tribute!  Damian Lewis is spectacular as Maj. Richard Winters.  From what I've read from interviews, he was told by the men of Easy Co., during the world premiere in Normandy, that he nailed his portrayal of Winters.  That must've been such a validation as an actor.  I loved him in The Forsyte Saga, and I love him even more now after seeing Band of Brothers.  This man is talented!  Everyone did an incredible job.	5.0	Wonderful tribute to such incredible display of courage.	2006-02-20	5	3	2
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1XBJUKJ0D0GFC	ac	Im just facinated with WWII.  I have seen almost all the movies made including the early black and white films such as &quot;The Longest Day&quot; and up to &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; I never thought anything as good as &quot;Private Ryan&quot; would ever be created untill Spielberg got back to his wounderful doing, and created this. Band of Brothers is the best film, mini series, whatever you want to call it, to ever be created. Its a whole look at the major campaigns in the European war. You feel the soldiers, and the war, and it makes you ahh yet truely proud.	5.0	The best ever	2003-01-04	5	3	2

I had seen clips of it, and it seemed like it would be an OK gift...He and I were glued to the television set for the next 3 days.  My mom got upset at us because we tried to skip meals so we wouldn't miss a second of it.  ""What's so great about it?  All war movies are the same.""  Lo and behold, one week later, she, too, found herself glued to the TV as she watched the series from beginning to end.The footage is clear and scenery is amazing.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AT2J7H5TRZM8Z	A Customer	"......Well, the men of Easy Company were regular Joes. Oh, there were a few that were more educated and afew with military training but basically they were young Americans asked to perform duties that ultimately sacrificed the entire company, one way or the other. Easy Company suffered 150% casualties. Let me repeat that:150%! Can you imagine that?Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have been forefront in the effort to keep our past alive through ""Schlinder's List,"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". They are the executive producers of HBO's production of Stephen Ambrose's ""Band of Brothers"". I believe the cost of the production exceeded one hundred twenty million dollars but it was worth every dime... Folks, if you liked ""Saving Private Ryan"", you'll love this. I loved former movie but I believe this series is even better.The first episode dealt with the intense training that Easy Company went through in Georgia. They were pioneers in Airborne (Parachutists) warfare. Hanks and Spielbergdeliberately did not go after the big name Hollywood stars. The best known actor appears in the first episode as the hated Captain Herbert Sobel as portrayed by David Schwimmer from the ""Friends"" cast. Sobel was so mean that many of his trainees talked about killing him when they arrived in Europe. The training was not only physically exhausting but Sobel was a master of mind games. However, many years later, one of the veterans of the company saidthat it was his rigorous training that saved many lives in combat.The second episode concerned the D-Day jump of Easy Company behind Germany lines. The heroes of this episode were many but Lt. Richard Winters (later Major) begins to asserthimself as an amazing leader. As you probably know, almost all of the paratroopers did not land where they were supposed to due to intense anti-aircraft fire. One of the missions of Easy Company was to wipe out some massive German cannons (88's) which were creating havoc for the landing parties on Utah and Omaha Beaches. After gathering his forces together gradually, Winters led an assault on the cannons which is now textbook military strategy on such battles. The episode is called ""Day of Days"" and Winters thanks God for getting him through that incredible day.Easy Company was supposed to jump, accomplish their mission and go back to England. They did go back to England but not until they had fought its first big battle as an intactcompany in the French town of Carentan which was a valuable crossroads for both Allies and Germans. The third episode highlights the initial battle and the subsequent defensiveposition that the company went into after the battle to thwart massive German counterattacks. Each episode features different soldiers in their various roles. The individual acts of heroism are chronicled beautifully but nobody seems to thing much about it. They're doing their jobs and just trying to survive.The fourth episode highlights the move of Easy Company into Holland where it liberates a very grateful Eindhoven. There is really no battle and the people of the town are delirious to see the Americans after years of harsh treatment from the Germans. Although there is somefighting in this episode, it is probably the least violent episode to date. A false feeling that the war may be over by Christmas, 1944 starts to evolve. It wasn't to be, of course, but the lapse in fighting lulled the men into a false sense of security.The fifth episode has Easy Company traveling to Bastogne where the Germans are mounting a massive attack in a last ditch effort to stop the allies. Easy Company does not have enoughammunition, food nor the proper winter clothing but they do a miraculous job in holding off the Germans in attack after attack. This episode was directed by Hanks and reminded of the fierce battle scenes in ""Ryan"". Now Captain Winters is heavily featured in this episode in the battlefield as well as behind the lines where he has been promoted. He loves Easy Company and hates to sit behind a desk. There is a foreboding at the end of this episode that the nearfuture of the company is going to be trouble.Sure enough, Episode 6 concerns the now totally surrounded Easy Company's attempt to hold off German panzer attacks as well as far superior numbers. It is by far the bloodiestepisode as Easy gets [beat]. The episode features a young medic who is kept frantically busy due to the injuries and his lack of supplies. At the end of the episode, the casualties have mounted to a staggering degree but Easy Company still has fight left in it and are ready to move on into Germany...."	5.0	THE BAND OF BROTHERS SHOULD MAKE US ALL PROUD	2002-11-11	5	5	0

The Americans knew they were going to go to war with the Nazis. A military officer was yelling out rangers, navy, air force and paratroopers. No one knew what that was because it was a new ""idea"" towards fighting a war. Personally i believe that was the best fighting tool to break down the German war machine. There training they went though was intense. Especially with the company commander.When they were jumping into Normandy on June 6, 1944 the was unfathomable.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AW0WEJ5XO3V9F	"""ag2002"""	Word really cannot convey what I think of this masterpiece.  This is THE BEST film on World War II that I have seen to date and I have seen many.  The actors are perfectly casted -- all of them did a superb job in portraying the HEROES of Easy Company.  You can feel the ambiance of the 1940s, see what the men went through and be proud of the Greatest Generation ever!  Watching this film was a very humbling experience.  If you have never seen a war movie or have been deterred by watching any of them because of the violence, this is the one to see!  Yes, there is some violent scenes in this movie, but most of all, it is the amazing true story of the Heroes of Easy Company who fought one of the most important wars ever and it is important for us to remember and honor their sacrifice for our country.  If it were not for men like them, I can't imagine how we would have won World War II.  I am simply in awe of the Heroes from Easy Company and the Greatest Generation of men ever.  The documentary is also superb and best of all, you get to see the real life Heroes recollect their war experience.  I also recommend that you read the book by Steven Ambrose.  I give this movie and Steve Ambrose's book a FIVE STARS+  See it and get to know why the 1940s generation was the greatest.  Thank you Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for producing this superb film! Nobody could have done it better!	5.0	SUPERB - AN HONOR TO THOSE WHO SERVED	2004-01-02	5	3	2

It is really cool to have the actually EZ company members share stories before the episode begins.  Difficult for me to watch because it portrays what actually happens in war, but that is also it's strength because it doesn't sugar coat WWII events.

If I spoke Spanish I would be fine.  the captions do not work on any TV and show up as being blank. When I watch it, my family gets tired of having to interpret it for me and explain what is being said. I know that there is English captions out there, I have seen them on TV.

It is incredible how the effects were achieved.I enjoyed  Ron Livingston's diaries, I just wish that the introductions before each section had been omitted after the first one. I think that the same could have been done before each part of the series to make it more like a movie for the viewer.These are small complaints though. It is still a very fine production.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AEC8PB6H1J42T	Albert R.	Back in 2002, I was in a store purchasing Saving Private Ryan, I saw a boxed movie called Band of Brothers. I briefly scanned over it and put it back thinking it could neverbe as good as Saving Private Ryan, so I didn't buy it. I watched the special presentation of Band of Brothers on the history channel and realized I was an idiot not to have bought it back then. The movie stands with the standards left from saving private ryan, and was well made. The realisticness an similarities of Saving Private Ryan including the historical flow of events were very accurate to reality of WW2. Also the history channel edited a lot of material out and it was still great, just think of how much better it would be with the unedited version.	5.0	!OUTSTANDING!	2004-05-10	2	2	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1A87TUBBDPMF0	"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer"""	"I wasn't able to watch Band of Brothers when it aired on HBO in 2001, so I bought the late Stephen E. Ambrose's book of the same name.  It was the tie-in edition with the cover art taken from the miniseries promotional materials and a new foreword by the author describing the genesis of the miniseries and his praise for executive producers Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.  Ambrose stated that their personal interest and attention to detail were impressive, for they wanted to make sure they got everything right.I was finally able to borrow this 6-DVD set from a friend of mine who works on cruise ships, and I have found this to be not only a faithful adaptation of a very good non-fiction book about small unit warfare in the European Theater of Operations (...), but it's one of the most moving works made for television that I have ever watched.Band of Brothers follows the men and officers of Easy (E) Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, from the unit's formation at Camp Toccoa, GA in 1942 to its deactivation in the summer of 1945.  During that time, Easy endured many challenges and hardships, including training under a first commanding officer who was a martinet (Capt. Herbert Sobel, played by David Schwimmer), a baptism of fire in a night drop on Normandy, participation in the failed Operation Market Garden, and the harrowing stand of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge.In addition to Schwimmer, who makes you forget his more famous role as Ross in NBC's ""Friends"" as the tyrannical Capt. Sobel, the cast includes Damian Lewis as Maj. Richard Winters, Donnie Wahlberg as 2nd Lt. C. Carwood Lipton, and Colin Hanks (Tom's son) as 2nd Lt. Henry Jones....there are many, many more fine actors featured in the 10-hour running time of this marvelous miniseries.  The directors, which included Phil Alden Robinson and Tom Hanks, got outstanding performances from them all.The writing of each episode is also top-notch, capturing the spirit and the essential facts from Ambrose's book perfectly. Also worth mentioning are the amazing special effects and cinematography, and the late Michael Kamen (Die Hard) composed a hauntingly beautiful score that added emotional power to the stunning visuals of this monumental television miniseries.Disc 6 features a making-of featurette, a video diary from a cast member, and the documentary ""We Stand Alone Together.""I recommend Band of Brothers to anyone who wants to understand what the individual soldiers who fought in Europe during history's darkest period (...)"	5.0	"TV at its best shows the ""brotherhood of war"" and its bonds"	2004-04-21	7	6	1

As a Veteran of Vietnam Era myself and fully understanding war is hell no matter what generation or where it takes place this presentation was stunning and worthy of repeat viewing on occasion as a reminder of the evil of man against mankind visits upon us historically again and again.  There's a part of this story telling that weaves a comraderie that soldiers share in such a way I've never observed outside the military and sticks with you the rest of your life.Bravo to Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg to tell a story that's as genuine today as it was then as there seemingly will always be Hitlers that hunger to control and reign Supreme at the expense of the weak. Amazing that you could gather young actors that weren't alive during that action and recreate a portrayal appearing so genuine.

This production stands tall above most of the horrible pap you will see on TV.  Shows like this Deadwood, the Wire (seems to be a theme with HBO shows ;), new Battlestar, etc. make one pay attention- as if you are reading a good book.I can see now how the stories all are integrated together- one episode will introduce a theme, character, etc which may not show up to a few episodes down the road- keep your Eye on Lt Spears who makes a scary introduction but will Amaze in ""Breaking Point"" . Of course you get the visual and sound of the battle, which while amazing also shows the sheer carnage of modern warfare, you touch the people in Easy Company and they touch you. Almost all of this is passed on true stories told by the Men of Easy Comapny who were in the middle of all this madness.  Stand outs include the episodes ""Breaking Point""- a fine piece showing how to lead people and survive under extreme circumstances.  ""Day of Days""- the Jump into Normandy and the days that follow- you meet one of the amazing People of Easy who is also a great leader, Captain Winters. A quiet red haired Gentleman who guides his men and will be noticed throughout your viewing - keep your eyes on the interviews.  You also get overwhelming documentary that if it doesn't get you on an emotional level nothing will. Think every history class and People who decide to send others into Battle should take a long look at such works as these in order to get a glimpse at the Human side of conflict.

For me this series gives an extreme sense of pride and excitement to the history of the US Paratroopers.Band of brothers is an excellent retelling of some of history's  important moments.  It also portrays some amazing leadership and followership lessons for anyone to learn.  If you never watch another WWII movie/TV series watch this one.  If you have complaints I will be surprised!Some of the comments and reviews have pointed out that this is not a ""true"" representation of what happened in WWII during the battles portrayed.  I would like to remind viewers that this is in fact a TV series, based on a book, based on a retelling of events that occured many years ago.  It has been said that the most unreliable witness is the eye witness.  The same story told by 2 different people will inevitably be different on some, perhaps many accounts.  Please take this into consideration when viewing this series.You will not be dissapointed!"	5.0	My humble opinion...the best I have seen!	2008-01-11	0	0	0

Given that their training relatively minimal and they were sent to Europe to face some of the most battle-hardened SS Tank and mechanized units.  The the German paratroop units were also very well trained.  If German forces were not tied down in the Eastern front having to face the Soviet troops, the Normandy landings would have been a total failure if even attempted!	4.0	American Paratroopers in Europe from D-Day to VE day!	2014-06-19	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3MPP9N2Z640RV	Amazon Customer	The show itself is excellent and worthy of 5 stars.  I took one star away from this set though because it has no English SDH options (often the French and Spanish subtitles show up without warning, though that may be a problem with my cheap player).Since my hearing is beginning to fade, it would be nice if a future release had this added.Edit: It's come to my attention that some people have suggested turning on the closed captions on the TV.  While it is not as good as English SDH subtitles, the CC is at least watchable.  (Aesthetically, it's less pleasing, but it's watchable now).I still think it deserves being docked a star for not having the option on the disc menu	4.0	Marred by lack of English SDH	2013-01-27	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2O7KPMHT8C3I1	Amazon Customer	"First off - I'm not an AmericanSecond - I'm not ""active"" militaryThird - I think war is the most ""ugliest and most inhumane"" thing on planet Earth.With that out of the way, let me please comment on ""Band Of Brothers"".As Mr. Bando's site will point out no doubt - there are many innacuracies within this HBO mini-series. I donot mean to slight Mr. Bando - he has done an excellent job and a commendable service in pointing out historical inaccuracies in the series. We are in his debt.However, these inaccuracies, IMHO, donot detract from the main theme of this series. The ""Band of Brothers"" depicted here, were also part of the ""Greatest Generation"". To many today, this might sound like a tired, cliched term.Watch this series with an open mind - and it WILL change your opinion about this generation.What is ostensibly about the lives and experiences of the ""grunts"" of ""E"" Company, 506th PIR, 101st Airborne Division in the Second World War - turns into a living, moving picture about war as experienced through individual lives of the men who fought, suffered and died though it.This is no ""glorified"" version of war. This is no ""pep talk"". Nor is this propaganda. This is war - as seen through ordinary eyes. In all it's brutality and inhumanity - but also through it's courage and honour.Packed with perspective and insight - Band of Brothers allows those of us who were not a part of it, expereince life as they did. The interviews with the surviving veterans of the global cataclysm - right from training till the end of the war - allow us to see a different view of the war and how it affected each soul that went through it and lived to talk about it.This is not a patriotic drum beating film. This has nothing to do with the ""glory of combat"". This has ALL to do with ""ordinary men who did extra-ordinary things"". May we all be priviledged to have known men such as Mr. Richard Winters.Donot grduge the cost. This is ONE series that WILL change your life for the better. Get it."	5.0	"This is what ""Brotherhood"" means"	2004-12-12	17	16	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A125EWA8OCMY7P	Amazon Customer	Okay, the acting was great, effects were great, realism was pretty good, authenticity not bad as well.  It was a great way to waste a day or two.I'm not an Ambrose fan, which detracts from the series a little bit.  I'm just not into his ultra-glorification of war, and felt that though they did a good job showing the horrors of combat, the crappiness of downtime (with the exception of the cold in the Battle of the Bulge episodes) were really neglected.  These guys were constantly hungry, sleep deprived, on edge, etc...if you took the miniseries at its word, they jumped from battle to battle, with nary a break, in combat 6 or 7 days a week.My biggest beef was on the special features.  There were a few, but for the size of this boxed set, I expected something more.  One documentary, a video diary, and a making of.  Not very much.  Like I said, I'm not an Ambrose fan, but with his input into the series I was really hoping for some historical extra stuff, maybe some mini documentaries about what else was going on in the war during X part of X episode, to put everything into perspective.The worst, though, was &quot;The Message From Jeep&quot;.  It shows men and vehicles coming onto and up the beach at Normandy, with some spoken nonsense.  The men fade away, as do the vehicles, to show a bare beach.  Then, three modern Jeep vehicles appear on the beach.This is, without a doubt, the worst case of crass comercialization and capitalism I've EVER seen in my life.  Trying to use the miniseries, and the blood spilled at Normandy, to sell Jeeps????!!?!  How dare they???  I was going to give this four stars, but after that...it left such a bad taste in my mouth I don't ever want to own the set (which I was planning on buying after watching a borrowed copy from my brother-in-law).  Furthermore, I never, ever want to purchase a vehicle from Jeep, used or new.  I had planned, at some point in my life, to purchase a Jeep Wrangler.  There's no chance of that happening now.	2.0	Meh.	2004-05-30	103	19	84

I'm very hard of hearing and need subtitles, even with my hearing aids, on most DVD's.  Band of Brothers only has Spanish subtitles, which are useless to me.  My lower rating of this DVD is because I have been unable to make out the dialog, which is so frustrating to those of us with hearing difficulties.

This show was incredible, it's as close to actually being in the atmosphere as visual impressions are able to put you. The scenes are structured so the narrative never lags, each scene holding a kernel of a theme central to the story, the themes compelling enough so empathy is generated for the characters. And the themes are not what one might expect: insubordination, lack of respect for command, incompetence,  cruelty, character weakness, the list goes on. Definitely not what one expects from a so called regular war film. But let's get back to that budget. Spielberg(?) actually has troop transport planes authentic to the era perform take offs to simulate the departure of the troops for the invasion of Normandy.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A5IB1AB0NZ03Z	"""amy_j"""	This miniseries is incredible. From start to finish, I was in complete awe during all ten parts. It is difficult to comprehend what it must have been like for those young men to go to war. They certainly possessed a courage that I don't think I have. You get to know many of the soldiers throughout the miniseries, and your heart breaks when they die. This series does not glorify war, but instead depicts all of the horrors that actually take place during wartime.I highly recommend &quot;Band of Brothers.&quot; The DVD set is great because it has bonus features, including interviews with the real-life soldiers who were depicted in the series. Sixty years later, these men still get choked up when they recall their time of war. Just seeing this raw emotion and knowing how it has affected them all these years later is very touching. It certainly makes me appreciate all the more the sacrifices that they made for our country.	5.0	One of the best war films of all time	2004-05-13	3	3	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	ALC5AAS4ONNPT	Amy W.	"This mini-series will capture you the moment you start watching and won't let go until you're finished, then it will stay with you forever.  You will go away with a whole new understanding, respect and feelings of awe at what the men of WWII, and specifically, this group - the men of Easy Company - were able to accomplish, many times in situations that would cause the majority of us to be incapable of functioning.  Yet somehow, they managed to go on to save the world.  One of my wishes would be to meet the men this story is about and be able to thank them in person.  If you value our country's history at all, this movie will be one that you will cherish.You will get to ""know"" the characters and grow to feel as if you've known them for years.  You will go through their basic training, their first jump, the frustrations, the physical exhaustion, the hardships, and sense the brotherhood that you know is a life-long bond.  You'll be with them as they enter into war.  You'll experience the tension on the plane as they waited to jump into enemy territory on D-Day, and it will leave you glued to your tv.  You'll feel that stinging cold as they sit in wait at Bastogne, while being pummeled by the Germans.  Then at the end, you'll share that exhilaration of ""we made it"" with them.  By the ending credits, if you don't want to stand up and salute these men and run out and buy the biggest flag you can get, then it's time to re-evaluate your patriotism and sense of appreciation for our WWII vets.The acting is superb -- the different actors chosen for their roles were perfect.  I hadn't ever seen Damian Lewis in anything before this, and now he is one of my favorite actors.  He is phenomenal in the role of Dick Winters.  Ron Livingston was also great in his role, as well as all the other actors.  I was quite surprised at how well David Schwimmer was able to pull off the gruff attitude of Capt. Sobel.  Having seen him as the goofy character he was in ""Friends"", this movie showed his great acting ability.On the cover of the DVD box, it says ""They depended on each other and the world depended on them"".  All I can say is thank goodness for men like this, who were willing to do what it took to defend our nation.  Find a vet and thank him / her today.  We have a lot to thank them for."	5.0	You can't get any better than this	2009-12-30	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	ACBI3EFZ3S1K8	Andre Landrum	I am watching this series for the second time and it only gets better as you  pick up more details on subsequent viewings. This is the most moving account of Bastone and the Battle of The Bulge that has ever been made and is superbly done throughout. The producers were very fortunate to have been able to interview many of the actual men who were there and went through such a traumatic experience in battle. All battles in all wars are traumatic for men and women and this presentation illustrates very well the tremendous suffering it took to maintain freedom in Europe and the world at that time in history. It is indeed unfortunate that we, the human race, seem to repeat history like this over and over. I highly recommend this movie series to all Americans so that you may know just a part of the tremendous effort and expense it took to fight this war and more importantly the human lives that were lost or ruined by those extreamly difficult battle situations. It will make you very proud to be an American. Watch it!	5.0	VERY Moving Experience. A MUST SEE for all Americans	2014-05-31	1	1	0

After seeing it on blu-ray, there's no other way to see it. I noticed some complaints about dark scenes being grainy, but any amateur photographer knows that low lit scenes use film that has a higher sensitive to light (ISO), making it more grainy.

But the presentation is great.  A beautiful collector's tin, 6 DVDs in an accordian-style binding, great design, all around great purchase.Incidentally, this is what I asked for this past Christmas.  Santa was very good to me indeed.In case you HAVEN'T heard all the hoopla surrounding &quot;Band of Brothers,&quot; it is by far the best and most accurate screen adaptation of World War II.  It is taken from Stephen E. Ambrose's book of the same name, which is compiled from the diaries of the men of Easy company, 506th Airborne.  If you are a fan of serious war drama, World War II (like me), or epics, this is the DVD set to pick up.  But don't take my word for it alone, read all the other reviews.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2RILKTE950ML1	Anthony D. Wingate	A historical classic, in my book. I have watched many historical docudramas in my time, but this is one of the all-time greatest. With excellent production, direction, and the equipment, it takes one through a journey through what was the closest thing to hell one could imagine, a journey that a group of men took on, like many more of their generation, when their country and the world called on them. The range of emotions one can feel if they allow themselves to really get into the story is like a roller coaster ride. It can also leave one with a great appreciation for all of those that rose to the call at a crucial time in our history, as well as the whole world.	5.0	A Historical Classic	2014-07-12	0	0	0

(true friends!!)i recommend this mini-series to anyone who is interested in history, heroism, or simply stories of friendship and survival.  it is brilliantly acted and the changing narration allows the viewer to witness the war through the eyes of officers, privates and medics, and to focus on the company and their relationships as whole, not to mention the soldiers as individuals.  the documentary is an excellent way to delve deeper into the series as well as to observe how the war truly affected the men who served, not to mention their children and grandchildren.and props to brit actor damian lewis (lieutenant/captain/major richard lewis) for his american accent ~ took me a few minutes to recognize soames!	5.0	Props from a medieval historian!	2004-04-23	9	5	4
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2UKC6QFG9L5GV	Anton Ilinski	"To my humble opinion ""Band of Brothers"" is one of the best miniseries and definately the best war movie ever. I remember here in Russia some time ago the release of the series on video was streched for five weeks - every two episodes were coming out every Thursday. And I can't recall of some other film I was waiting more anxiously for. ""Band of Brothers"" graphically demonstrates what it means when a budget is spent wisely.There are no first-rate stars in the film (I think Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, David Schwimmer and Neal McDonough are not considered as ones with all my respect) but acting impresses a lot. You have not a glimpse of a doubt all that's happening on screen is true. The story-line is very intense like it should be in a war film and at the same time very thoughtful. It's not just an action movie, it's a real drama based on real events. And it's amazing to watch the main characters during all ten episodes as they mature physically and mentally.The edition itself it brilliant, it contains a lot of useful information about the history of Easy company. Besides there's a Ron Livingston's video diary of the days in boot camp all the actors had to pass before the shooting in the miniseries.This custom case DVD costs a lot but it is sure worth purchasing - maybe like no other edition available."	5.0	OUTSTANDING EDITION	2005-11-15	7	6	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A62G4QX6XQVLP	Anyechka	"This is a miniseries of epic proportions, but even though it's 10 hours long, plus a bunch of bonus features, it's well worth every single second.  To many people today who weren't there, WWII seems like ancient history, and the veterans are elderly.  This miniseries goes a long way towards disspelling those preconceptions among those who might have them.  The action and the times are immediate, and we get to see these soldiers as they were then, as young vibrant young men.  The viewer goes through everything they do--basic training, preparations for D-Day, D-Day itself (the second episode really makes it vividly clear just why it was called ""Day of Days""), battles in France, Operation Market-Garden in Holland, how the men felt towards the replacements who came in after D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium and the long hard ordeal in the forest of Bastogne, battles in Germany, the ending of the war in Germany, the liberation of the Landsberg camp, the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest in the beautiful Austrian mountains, and their very early return to civilian life during the immediate end of the war, while they were still stationed in Austria but not doing any more fighting.  BoB makes it so clear why this generation has been dubbed ""The Greatest Generation,"" why WWII was a morally justified war, and why we should all be very thankful that these men (and countless others like them) did this, sometimes even making the ultimate sacrifice, to free Europe and the world from tyranny.  It portrays war as it really is, and makes this experience so real.Each of the main discs has a field guide, which provides a glossary, an explanation of Army ranks, maps, a historical timeline, a summary of the episode, and profiles of the soldiers featured in each episode.  I was very pleased that the sections on the soldiers contained no spoilers, so that the viewer can find out for oneself what happens to each particular soldier in each episode as opposed to knowing ahead of time, for example, that one of them might be killed or injured during that episode.  The bonus material is also great.  There's a featurette on the making of BoB, a special message from Jeep, previews of each episode, a very powerful, moving, and poignant documentary based around interviews with the surviving veterans of Easy Company and historical footage, short video clips to give a general idea of each of the main soldiers, a written who's-who section on the soldiers, and a 12-part video diary from actor Ron Livingston, showing the real boot camp he and his co-stars went through in preparation for this miniseries.  You don't really find that kind of thing too much anymore, with actors literally throwing themselves into a role like that.  They went through ten days of boot camp and the exact type of military training the real-life soldiers did, complete with equipment and clothing from the 1940s, and also had to endure such things as sleeping in bombed-out buildings and re-enacted battle scenes.  This was a great strategy, and helped them immensely in being able to portray these soldiers so well, since they'd already been put in their mindset and gone through these experiences more or less for real.Since this miniseries is 10 hours long and the viewer goes through so many emotional ups and downs with these men, with such realistic recreations of battles and everything else they went through, one can almost feel as though one knows these men and that it's more than just a very long movie.  This is an incredibly epic and personal experience, and is so much more than just another WWII movie.  (Although, for obvious reasons, I wouldn't recommend watching it with young children, due to the graphic violence, graphic injuries, a brief sex scene near the beginning of the ninth episode, and a lot of off-color language.)  We see war through the eyes of those who lived it; it's not portrayed as some glorious adventure, nor is it potrayed as constant bombardment and suffering.  We see the ups and the downs of war, and fully come to see in the ninth episode why this war had to be fought.  I actually felt a bit sad after coming to the end of the bonus disc, after having invested so much time and emotion into the lives of these heroic men.  This is one of the most emotional and powerful movie experiences anyone could ever hope for, and one that should be revisited many times."	5.0	What an experience!	2006-05-27	16	16	0

An actor, Ron Livingston, kept a video diary of the beginning stages of his involvement in the production.  We see him beginning to research his role of Lewis Nixon, Battalion and Regimental intelligence officer by reading Stephen Ambrose histories and 1940's field manuals.  He meets Lewis Nixon's widow and pores over photos of the man he's playing.  We see him awed by a telephone call with the REAL commander of Easy Company, Dick Winters,in which he promises to do his best in acting the part of Winters' lifelong friend.THAT's part of what makes this production special.  The writers did additional research for each episode, in many cases interviewing the surviving members or family of Easy Company.  The actors did the same, in many cases calling from the set to run a line reading by the vet they were playing.  The Easy family members speak fondly of ""our actor,"" the one who played their vet.  All of that bonding and commitment to getting it right comes through on the screen.This is an off-the-charts production that repays repeated viewings.

Memorial Day is the perfect time to honor those sacrifices made by so many to help insure freedom.

One of the great benefits of this marvelous series was the closeup interviews of the real men portrayed, those wonderful old seamed faces, breaking at last with emotion as they recall their experiences and the love of their comrades and the pain of loss of other friends. It moves me greatly, and I'm glad the Extras in this set has an extended documentary re-tracing the time-frame of the film with these real veterans recalling the action we've seen re-created.Brought with loving care and fanatic attention to detail by producers Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks and their carefully chosen band of producers, directors and actors, this is an unsentimental, near-documentary telling of the story of Easy Co. from training to D-Day, Hedge Row fighting, Operation Market Garden, Bastogne, into Germany, liberation of Death Camps, and the capture of Berchesgarden & Hitler's Eagle's Nest.Throughout it all, the aim has been to tell it straight and get it right. They have done so in remarkable style.  The truth HAS enough drama, and the various episodes reveal it.  We get to know these men and care about them.  We marvel at their endurance and the way they go about getting the job done, professionally, and with matter-of-fact, everyday courage. It is a true tribute to the Citizen Soldiers who won the war.With 10 episodes and lots of extra goodies, presented within an exceptional package, there is just too much to review here.  Some memorable moments:  the harrowing jump into the explosive, tracer-lit night skies of Normandy; the assault on the 88's; Winter's killing the young German; the episode dedictated to the Medic; the monstrous artillery barrage on the men in the snowy forest of Bastogne; the shock of the farmer's wife on seeing the closeup hand-to-hand killing of the German by ""Bull""; and finally, the incredibly moving scenes of the liberation of the Concentration Camp, and the final days of Easy at the War's end.These last episodes are all the more powerful because we have followed Easy Co. and these men and  have seen the death so random and arbitrary around and among them that a slow emotional tension has been built that we now realize with the intensity of anger/pity/horror at the Camps and the bittersweet joy and subsequent farewell of VE day.I could cite great moments by each individual actor, and nicely played and effectively understated but powerfully emotional scenes but suffice it to say this is an ensemble piece with superb performances throughout. The quiet power of the different episodes underscores how wonderfully written the entire piece is, and with corresponding excellent direction and production values.A one-of-a-kind production, having the time to tell the tale with detail and care, and with all involved doing honor to the men who lived it.  And finally, there are those men, bringing it all back to the reality of real lives lived.  Exceptional stuff."	5.0	The real heroes are still over there......	2003-02-08	478	470	8

Anybody that was fascinated or moved by ""Saving Private Ryan"" will likely find appeal here as well.  Points to ponder:-  The war violence is, of course, to be expected-  The language is quite strong -- the complete vocabulary builder.  I have read elsewhere that the language was so strong that a 101st WWII veteran cancelled his HBO subscription after two episodes, citing that the use of expletives was not as prevalent as depicted.-  Episode 9 has the only sexual nudity and sex in the whole 10 episode set (episodes had different directors) -- one brief but active vignette.  It arrives without warning and is not that demure.  Watch out if you are using this as a patriotic history tool with mid-teens.-  The first episode has no combat -- it builds your connection to the characters and the unit's background in training.  You will want to watch the first two episodes back-to-back.-  If you are a sucker for movie soundtracks/scores, this is a particularly good one.-  It is touch-and-go getting my wife to watch a war movie sometimes, but in this case, she was transfixed by the drama and demanded ""put in another episode!""-  Might or might not be a good idea to watch the documentary about the actual Easy Company guys, with interviews, before watching the episodes -- you can get a sense of what they went through, but you also may find out which of the real guys did not make it home."	5.0	Awesome (Here are some things you should know)	2004-04-20	11	8	3

Nevertheless, this is an outstanding series of stories about WWII in Europe and the men that fought there.I was introduced to this series only about 6 months ago, but I have already watched this entire series through more than a few times.The storylines are engaing, the characters and acting are top-notch, and the staging, filming, and effects are excellent.The feelings of fighting men, their commitment to each other, their willngness to sacrifice for each other, and their unwillingness to let a comrade down come across in a crystal clear fashion.  It has been said that fighting men do not usually do what they do for home or country (though that's usually in the mix), but they do what they do in order to support their brothers in arms.  That impression and sentiment is made and strengthened throughout the entire series.This is a series worth watching over and over.  It repesents what is best about our country and those that put themselves in harm's way to defend it (and us).I'd like to express sincere thanks to the writers, producers, and actors, but most especially to those who fought and lived and those who fought and died.  We all owe you a great debt.  Thank you!	5.0	Fitting tribute and great drama!	2009-02-02	1	1	0

I knew that it was highly acclaimed, but the reviews don't so it justice. If you want a glimpse into the real life stories of the men who freed the world and defeated a true evil, this is the best DVD around.Band of Brothers combines the realism of Saving Private Ryan while getting into far more detail. The rigorous training, the camaraderie that they felt, even their distancing themselves from new recruits to avoid getting attached to guys who they likely would see dead, all speak to the realism of this portrayal of WW II. Unlike any war prior, WW II was mainly a squad level war with a couple dozen soldiers on each side fighting it out rather than massive waves of men and Ambrose selected just the right size of outfit and the right people to profile.Perhaps just as telling is the lack of traditional heroes. The men who served in Easy Company were no angels or John Wayne types, just regular Joe's from all over America who heard the call and served their country. None of them wanted to be there but they had a job to do and in those days you just did what you had to do. The men of Easy Company went a step further and volunteered to jump out of airplanes for some reason. I had a history professor in college, a diminutive old man who looked like he wouldn't hurt a fly, who was a volunteer for the glider corps. He told us he did it to impress girls!What I found most poignant were the introductions by veterans and the stories of their lives after they returned from Europe. One veteran recounted that some young men he knew from his home town were rejected from service due to medical conditions, and were so distraught at not being able to serve that they committed suicide. It is hard in modern day America to imagine that anything could stir up our population with that sort of single-mindedness, given that we already are complaining about steps to combat terrorism as being too intrusive (like being in a collapsing building brought down by terrorists is preferential to having to wait in line to get to your gate at the airport). When the men returned home, they went back to living their lives grateful to be alive and back in America.

I saw one episode on TV and on the recomendation of a friend (ok, of a passel of friends) bought the series for my husband, who was agitating for it. We both like it a great deal. It's something you can watch slowly, with some consideration, and enjoy (in a somber kind of way). It's about the original Airborn units... The interviews with the vetrans make it something very special. This is the last generation that these vetrans will be alive to tell their story, and we should listen and learn from them; they are us, and this war is something different from any war before or since. It's not for no reason it was called a world war. Trnasportation and communication were finaly good enough to involve the entire planet in a conflict, but the tactics and planning were still evolving to catch up with this fact. A lot of firsts, in that war.	5.0	Complicated	2003-02-11	6	5	1

As it happened, he had served in the Pacific rather than in Europe, but having seen both Band of Brothers and The Pacific, I preferred the former and thought he would, too.This is packed with stellar yet understated performances, not the least of which is Brit Damian Lewis' totally convincing portrayal of an American, and the interviews with the actual veterans, whose identities are not revealed until the end of the series, give it credibility without any of the cloying sentimentality usually found in epic films about war.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1CQGAPQMN41LV	"A. Whitehead ""Werthead"""	"Filmed in 2000 and transmitted in 2001, Band of Brothers is a 10-part mini-series which remains the most expensive TV series ever made (at least until the budget for its new companion series, The Pacific, is revealed). The series was developed by Steven Spielberg as a continuation of the themes and ideas he explored in his hit 1998 movie, Saving Private Ryan. Whilst the film's running time meant that only a small portion of the Second World War could be depicted, the greater scope and length afforded to a series meant that more of the conflict could be shown and the characters' story arcs would be more satisfying. Also, it was decided that, unlike the purely fictitious Saving Private Ryan, the TV companion piece would be based on true events and real soldiers. The rights to the book Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose were purchased and Ambrose and the surviving soldiers portrayed in the book were brought in to consult on the project.Band of Brothers opens in 1942, shortly after the formation of the 101st Airborne Division by the US Army. The first episode follows the training of Easy Company at Toccoa, Georgia, over the course of a year. They are placed in the care of Captain Herbert Sobel (Friends' David Schwimmer) who trains them far harder than the other men of the 101st, with the result that soon the company has a reputation as the best company in the division. However, Sobel's methods make him highly unpopular with the men, especially when it is revealed that his nerves fail him in field exercises. The unit is shipped to England to train and prepare for D-Day, but Sobel's limitations are eventually recognised and he is relieved of command. The second episode has the 101st parachute into Normandy just ahead of the beach landings. When Easy Company's commanding officer is killed during the drop, it falls to Lt. Richard Winters (Damien Lewis) to assume command and lead a daring attack on a German artillery position targeting the beaches. Winters becomes the closest thing to a central character and is one of only a few characters to appear in every episode.What initially impresses about Band of Brothers is its authenticity. Its production values would be impressive for a movie, but for a TV series they are stunning. But where the series really works is its focus on the characters. Whilst some events are dramatised or compressed for timing reasons, pretty much everything that happens in the series is based on a true event and every one of the main characters is based on a real person. This makes the series unpredictable and strongly emotionally resonant: if a character is wounded or killed without warning, it is because his real-life counterpart was wounded or killed at that point of the war. This is also why every single actor brings his A-game to his role: when the person you are playing is actually going to be watching your performance, or if he has passed away and his friends are, then you definitely need to be on top form.The producers seemed to realise early on that simply having ten episodes of non-stop carnage would get boring pretty quickly, so each episode is built around different characters and premises, and the individual episode directors are allowed to indulge their own artistic styles somewhat more than is normal on a television drama. A particular stand-out is the sixth episode, which focuses on Easy Company's medic during the Battle of the Bulge and follows him from unit to unit, seeing his friends get wounded and having to patch them up, or having to watch them die. It is an incredible piece of television drama. As is traditional with HBO, they don't make things too easy for the viewer. Easy Company is made up of several platoons, with some episodes focusing entirely on one group and others on all of them, meaning that characters appear, disappear and reappear from episode to episode. Characters are also promoted, demoted, wounded or killed off and the viewer is expected to work out who is who and what they are doing sometimes very quickly. This lack of spoon-feeding is as refreshing here as it is on other HBO productions such as The Wire, but casual viewers may find themselves swamped on first viewing.The series employs an interestingly desaturised colour tone, which puts its feel somewhere between full colour and black and white. Whilst this adds immensely to atmosphere, it does make telling some of the characters apart difficult, again on first viewing, especially as most of the time they are wearing full combat gear and helmets. For these reasons the series rewards careful re-watching and is also better suited to the DVD format, with the viewer able to watch several episodes in a row and work out who is who and what their roles within the company are.The series' action sequences rival some of the strongest war movies in their intensity and vividness, but it's in the quiet moments that it excels. The banter between the men is authentic and the importance of the bonds that form between soldiers in combat with regards to keeping them sane is strongly emphasised (more cliched, ""I love you, Sarge!"" moments are firmly absent, thankfully). In fact, one of the strongest moments in the series comes when one of the company's toughest, most effective lieutenants suddenly breaks down after seeing two of his men get their legs blown off in front of him. The mental pressures of the war are portrayed as being as dangerous and difficult to deal with as enemy action. Questions of morality in warfare are also intelligently raised: one soldier is rumoured as having brutally gunned down more than a dozen unarmed German PoWs on D-Day but later proves himself to be the bravest and most efficient officer in the unit whose actions repeatedly save the lives of his men.Band of Brothers (*****) is a staggeringly impressive piece of work, not just for its incredible budget and impressive special effects, but for its intelligent and often powerful writing, phenomenal acting and the resonance provided by knowing that pretty much everything that happened in the series is based on a real event. It is available on DVD in the UK and USA, and also now on Blu-Ray in the UK and USA."	5.0	Spectacular	2009-01-09	0	0	0

With this in mind, I'll spare you the review of the actual series, and just say that this is a great addition to a growing Blu-Ray collection.  I already owned this on DVD, but when seeing that the Blu-Ray price was only $10 more than the DVD for hours upon hours of entertainment(compared to the average 2-hour movie on Blu-Ray charging a $10 to sometimes $20 premium over it's DVD counterpart, I just couldn't pass up on this.  It was well worth the repurchase.  And my DVD set won't go to waste, as my younger brother has been eyeing it ever since I got it, so now he benefits as well.  The picture and sound quality of this set is superb.  As far as my modest Blu-Ray collection goes, this is by far the crown jewel as of now.	5.0	Definitely worth owning on Blu-Ray	2008-11-23	8	7	1

I wonder how much the series cost HBO???Anyway&#65533;one of my favorite parts is when the actual men from Easy Company give a brief synopsis of the upcoming episode; so poignant and emotional.  It&#65533;s truly amazing how anyone can live through such a horrific experience, go on, and have some degree of normalcy in their lives.Thank you Easy Company, all of those who fought in the US Armed Forces, and our fellow allies, who rid the world of such utter evil.	5.0	Extraordinary film about extraordinary individuals	2003-02-05	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AYLHQYF7OCSU5	B Ardell Young	I teach American History in high school and this DVD gets the point across to students in a way that no documentary or the standard two-hour movie.The strongest points of the movie is it is completely true and story-lines not inserted to make it appealing to the public and it does not create super hero types though Major Winters and Mathew Settle's character showed the true spirit and toughness of the American GI.I do not mean to single out those two as more heroic because Richard Winters sums up the role of every man in Easy company with his parting letter to his grandchild. Anyone not moved by Winter's letter has no heart nor understands how war bonds men.I knew a man who was a paratrooper, not in Easy Company, who was twenty-five years older than me and we spent hours talking about his experiences after D-Day and the march into Germany. He was another silent hero and told me that he had never talked to anyone about his experiences in World War II until he crossed my path.His name was Dick Morgan and we met in Savannah, Ga. in the early 1970s. At that time, he was selling office products and I was one of his customers. He tolerated fifteen years of my pulling information out of him. He died in 1988 and since I began teaching school in 1991, I have made a point of every class knowing who Dick Morgan was and what he did during World War II.He earned that just as all of the veterans of World War II did with their service to our country. Anyone reading this review will have to excuse my addition of Dick to it but he is someone that all Americans owe a huge debt and someone I will never forget.	5.0	BEST MOVIE ABOUT WORLD WAR II	2008-07-08	1	1	0

Band of Brothers is much more than a show or movie it is history.  The story of real life people and how they endured from boot camp to the end of WW2 in Europe, puts the audience right there with them.  Interviews of the real survivors of Easy Company make the action even more believable.  Band of Brothers is not just battle scenes, but rather it is about the people, what they felt, how they grew as soldiers, a unite and friends.  Band of Brothers should be watched over and over to realize just what the Greatest Generation had to endure to beat the Nazi's and restore freedom to Europe.	5.0	Every American should watch this	2014-06-04	1	1	0

The complete set has many 1 hour episodes you can watch easily, and the picture and sound quality are incredibly good.I'm a Christian and am thankful for this incredibly well-acted and produced series. It depicts, however, many scenes that I'm sure were true to life in the war, including a good bit of strong profanity in parts as well as brief nudity in one scene in a latter episode. The development of characters is very creatively done, and I was drawn in to sympathize with these guys who often lost buddies that they fought beside. Just know that there are parts of the episodes that are not suitable for kids.The sacrifice of our armed servicemen is so well portrayed here that it gave me an even greater sense of appreciation for their gift to our country.	5.0	Nicely produced and acted - parents, beware, but a great series	2013-05-18	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A16NK4WD84MNK8	Barry Robinson	"What do you get when Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks (director and star of Saving Private Ryan) team up with HBO? An amazing movie I could exceed the limits of this review talking about. Now right away some people might be thinking ""HBO, so this is a TV production."" Yes, it did originally debut on HBO but this is without a doubt cinema quality and has been released in selected theaters. Trust me and all the other excellent reviews that this movie not only delievers the best in action and story telling but also the true tale of the men of Easy Company of the 101st Airborne. Production values are extremely high. After the third episode the production team used more pyro technics than Saving Private Ryan and thats a lot. Throughout, the movie stays true to Ambrose's book and features top notch acting. Details, details. The story is so incredibley detailed that you'll need to watch the entire series several times before you catch every bit of excellence. This is truely film making at it's best as only Steven Speilberg can deliever. Now, I bet you want to know what each episode is about...Currahee - This is a great episode that introduces most of the main cast through training camp. The training is tough but no where near as tough as the upcoming D-Day invasion they set out on in the very end (which is very dynamic). 10/10Day of Days - This is a lot of action which to some will make up for the first's lack of. However, there is more to be had than just action. Winters (the main character) must deal with the death of one of his men. This is a moving episode that, unlike it's predecessor, ends with a sorrowful feeling. 10/10Carentan - This is a powerful episode that boasts a lot of action. For the first time, viewers take a look at the brutality of war and the affect it has on Private Blythe. This is not the best in the series but is excellent non the less. 10/10Replacments - This episode makes viewers really feel for the replacments who aren't excepted by the older guys. This episode, like Carentan, shows the brutality of war, but on a whole new level. This is a great episode that ends on a low note with Easy Company forced to retreat after heavy casualties. 10/10Crossroads - This is an excellent episode showing how the newly promoted Winters deals with his new job behind a desk, writing reports and the like. He wishes he were back on the battle fields with the men he has grown so close to. Never freight action fans becuase the title Crossroads actually refers to Winter's last battle before promotion. This episode is really good. 10/10Bastogne - This episode shows that sometimes the enemy wasn't the only thing life threatening. In the bitter cold forests of Belgium, Easy Company holds the main line of resistance in preparation for The Battle of the Bulge. This episode focuses on Doc. Roe, one of Easy's few medics. This episode knocks a few main characters out of the series, some only temporarily, but manages to end with a laugh. 10/10The Breaking Point - This is a spectacular episode that deals with the internal war many soldiers fight to keep themselves from going mad. Not only this, the final battle for Foy is amazing espeicially when Speirs single handedly charges the remaining German infantry. This episode knocks off a good portion of the main cast, this is very sad. 10/10The Last Patrol - This episode focuses on war as meirley a game that some of the men have grown to laugh at. Webster returns to the company after four months at the aid station. This not only shows how the bonds have strengthend between the men in Bastonge but how they are almost unwilling to except him back. Even after this and several more casualties this episode manages to end with a sence of hope that many of the soldiers will make it out alive.Why We Fight - This episode will probally be the one least rewatched not because its bad, simply becasue of how good it is. This episode shows a side of the war many don't like to confront. Easy encounters a Jewish prison camp and if you've seen Schindler's List, times that by two and add color. This episode is the only one that made me actually cry, although The Breaking Point came close. Watch it for what it is not necessarely for entertainment. 10/10Points - simple in name but deep in plot. For the main portion of this episode the war is over. Easy has captured Hitler's Eagle's Nest and is now waiting around for either redeployment or a perminent trip home. With nothing to do, trouble brews and although the war is over, violence is still present. This episode has it's sad points but ultimatley ends on a high note where viewers finally learn what became of the men who survived. The ending interviews are also very good. This is a perfect conclusion to a more than perfect (if that makes any sence) movie.Anyone with a pulse should be moved by this movie and I highly recommend you buy it, assuming you can handle the graphic violence and heavy language.Thanks for reading."	5.0	An acheivment that will forever live in our hearts!	2004-12-10	15	13	2

I found the road that Dick Winters statue was erected on just a week prior to my arrival. I went to saint Marie dumont, where the 101 landed.

Everything about this series is done with integrity and shows much of the great commeraderie and strength, the personalities and personal thoughts of the troops, as well as some of the more difficult sides of war and ultimately our part in the victory of WWII from the soldiers' persective.  Each episode begins with a documentary style shot of one of the real veterans who are the ""characters"" in the film and it adds that necessary reminder that ""this is real, this really happened"" element that we sometimes forget when watching these kinds of documentaries/movies.  It is also very compelling, entertaining, comical, heart-touching and realistic.  I've seen it on DVD and Blu-ray disc and the Blu-ray is just as good as it always is.

I had seen it so many times that I just had to get it on blue ray, a one day sale that had it bundled with the first episode of pacific for $37(I won't buy the pacific till its dirt cheap cause of the one sided blame america theme, and not on my must have list), so I bought band of brothers blue ray immediately, and point being is I watch my emails regularly for amazon's one day sales, or super sales, I mean, I've gotten in on so many 60% off sales, case in point again last year I got in on the complete ""Combat"" with Vic Morrow from the sixties on dvd for just a $130, a wonderful show that I won't ever need in blue ray.  I don't want to get every last movie and show on blue ray, and I won't, just a select few.The transfers to blue ray are nice and clear, there is some intentional grany shots, or shots and scenes that couldn't be made crystal clear in low light back then, that is to be expected.  The sound really is alot better than dvd seemingly, kind of made me jump many times.  The extras are something I haven't explored as of yet, I'm a blue ray newbie anyway.Mainly though, if you think you've really seen it too many times already, then you are like me and have, just see it again in blue ray if you can afford it or don't have to spend too much.  Ha, far better than the vhs set I bought a long time ago and still own, back when all I had was a vcr and a tv from the mid nineties, and one of those signal clarifyers that improved signal between vcr and 75 owm connector on the tv.I did notice for all those thinking about buying a blue ray copy that the BoB blue ray packaged with the part one of the Pacific is still regularly cheaper than just the blue ray BoB package alone."	5.0	Blue ray is really great	2010-12-05	3	3	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2LGIVTVJ7PJXN	"BCBLoyd ""bcbloyd"""	"This DVD set is more than a documentary and more than a movie. It's 10 mini-movies based on the real World War II experiences of Easy Company of the US 101st Airborne Division. Band of Brothers covers the lives (and in many cases the deaths) of the brave men of Easy Company from boot camp, to Normandy, from defending Holland to liberating Nazi concentration camps, from Bastogne's Battle of the Bulge to Capturing Hitler's mountainside retreat known as the Eagle's Nest. Their name may have been Easy Company, but there was NOTHING ""Easy"" about what these men went through!I won't go into detail, since others have already done so, but I will say this. After watching all 10 episodes, as well as the documentary segments with the actual men who lived through it all, and the making of the movie... I feel it should be required watching for any American History student in college. (Some scenes are very bloody/gory, but that's war.) It doesn't sugar-coat the tragedy of man's inhumanity to man. It shows the ups, downs, good, and bad of war and the cost of liberty. It far surpasses other WWII movies done by ""Hollywood"" in the past.I highly recommend this series!"	5.0	Real Life - BETTER than Fiction, but NOT Easy	2003-08-08	4	4	0

Knowing that the stories are real and the characters are actual people who lived it helps to draw you in even deeper.  This is quite possibly the best movie or series about WWII ever created.  At the end of the final disk, if you aren't filled with pride, you aren't a true American, and if you haven't shed a tear, you aren't human.The production quality is big budget blockbuster movie quality.  The camera work is amazing.  The actors do a phenomenal job.  Damian Lewis did a great job as Maj. Richard Winters.I loved the way that each episode was done from a different soldiers perspective.  It allows you to get an better understanding of just some of the things they went through over there.

One such feature is the ""field guide timeline"" where you can click and watch war-time news reels about the battles in question, look at interactive maps, or read info on soldiers & equipment as the episode plays.

The attention to detail in the series is amazing, and I liked the fact that some of it was filmed on location.My one complaint is that it is just a little overpriced.  Well, a lot overpriced.  If you compare the cost of this to other series, it is much more expensive.  For instance, for just about $20 more, you can own the first four seasons of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  For less than double the cost the first five seasons of SEX IN THE CITY.  I'm not quite sure how they decide on how much to charge for each set that is produced, but with the full seasons of most television shows running around $35 from Amazon, the price tag on this one seems excessive.	5.0	Really impressive, and I don't even like war films or shows!	2004-01-25	7	3	4

I've read the book repeatedly, and watched the whole dvd series at least a dozen times.  (The series is definitely better in surround sound, by the way.)  The film quality is terrific, and feels very realistic.  Especially in some of the more harrowing parts (shelling, or the assault on a Kraut position in Episode 2).  Sometimes it has a ""gritty"" look to it.  But this only enhances the action.  It's also almost impossible to put down or turn off.  (I've yet to be able to watch just one episode at a time.  It usually ends up being three or four at a minimum.)  Many of the other reviews provide you with all the detail you could ask for.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2DAMRVEQXPIJ8	Bill	To &quot;A viewer from San Diego&quot; ... to answer your &quot;So I bet there were many 'bands of brothers' on the German side too&quot; comment, of course there were, and nobody with any sense thinks otherwise. If you'd actually watch the miniseries you'd realize there are some quite vivid scenes describing just that (toward the end where the German officer is addressing his troops -- exhausted but still standing straight -- following their surrender, and calls them a &quot;band of brothers,&quot; for just one example). This isn't Star Wars, buddy, and Spielberg and Hanks know that.Are you sure you aren't Neville Chamberlain speaking from his grave? To respond to your &quot;It is a shame that war becomes gloryfied [sic] in a miniseries in this way when it is really the worst thing that man has created&quot; comment, I'd say yes, war is terrible indeed, terrible almost beyond measure, but then what's your alternative? This miniseries is based on a true story, so should the script have been &quot;adjusted&quot; to more accurately portray &quot;the worst thing that man has created?&quot; Or should a 10-part movie be made about a company who died to a man and didn't do a single heroic thing (I think you'd be hard pressed to find one, but just for the sake of argument)? Or would you have us ignore the history of war completely and try to forget it instead? I think not. Defeatists and pacifists are what got our world into the mess in the first place.&quot;Those who will not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.&quot; - George Santayana.As to &quot;glorifying&quot; war, without the courage, valor, determination, and fortitude of the Allied soldiers and their leaders the entire world's history since the 1940s would be absolutely unrecognizable to any of us today. And, again, if you'd actually watch the miniseries you'd realize that it does not try to &quot;glorify&quot; war in any sense -- this story is told without the gloves on, and the horror and pain of war couldn't possibly be clearer to the viewer.Here's my review: for the entire planet World War II is the single most important human-driven event of our time. Stephen E. Ambrose's book is truly amazing and is also highly recommended, but for visual learners and people raised on television this mini-series is, hands down, the best and most informative medium I've ever seen for learning about WWII in Europe. Watching this DVD set will make you laugh, cry, and appreciate, but it will mostly make you learn more about the Allied soldier's perspective of the war in Europe than you ever thought possible. Buy it today if not sooner.	5.0	Rebuttal for &quot;A viewer from San Diego&quot;	2003-12-28	17	12	5
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2POYXTGSPSW7O	Bill Hensler	"My wife got me this DVD.  I love it.  Gosh, there is hardly one thing I don't love about this DVD series.Now, if you're thinking of buying it:  DO SO!!!  It's money well spent.  This DVD series is far better than Saving Private Ryan and that is not a bad DVD either.I've been putting together models of German Armor for years.  On the set of ""Brothers"" they have reproductions of Tigers, Stug IIIs, Marders, and Jadpanthers.  The Stug was done so good it fooled me and only a DVD frame-by-frame analysis showed that it was a substitute, made of a former British personnel carrier.  But, what a wonderful substitute.  It is the attention to detail that makes you feel that the producers really went the extra mile in making this series.I'll give you another example of attention to detail.  In 1942 American aircraft had a star with a red circle inside as the national insignia.  That marking was only vaild for 1942 and earler.  In 1944 the invasion markings on the transports were obviously hand panted.  That is also correct for the period.  The producers went the extra mile just to research aircraft markings.  Yes, people like me pay attention and this will add to your enjoyment of the DVD.  Tom Hanks & crew got it right.Then there are the actors.  D. Williams plays LT/CPT/Major Winters.  What a fantastic job!  Darn, I wish my officers in the real military were half as good as Winters.  You never get over the impression that CPT Winters is a perfect American officer.  He's cool under fire, makes good decisions, and leads by example for his men.  Lt. Winter's mild words to an enlisted man, PVT Blythe, restores the man's courage and makes him an effective combat soldier.  What a leader!  Did D. Williams get an Emmy award for this performance?  He deserved it!!!Words excape my frail ability to write about Band of Brothers.  Now, if you read the book ""Band of Brothers"" by Stephen Ambrose it does give you some important background information.The reason why Winters does not drink (they make a big deal about this in the series) is he used to be a nationally rated wrestler in college.  So, Winters merely kept himself in athletic training mode while in the Army.  True athletes in training do not drink, it's empty calories.I really enjoyed the action between CPT Williams and CPT Nixon, the 506th S-2 (intelligence).  The book does a fantastic job of showing Nixon as two things:  1.  he was a wonderful planner and researcher for the Army (a positive effect of Yale) and 2.  he drank too much (a negative effect of fraternity life at Yale).Nixon loses the 506th Brigade job and the series makes a big deal about it.  This is a little different than the book because the war was winding down, another officer did want the job, and Nixon's drinking plus personal problems just gave an excuse to transfer Captain Nixon to Major William's command.  Remember, the European war was ending and the career soldiers were getting the plum assignments.I think the best part of the post fighting series is when Major Williams gives Captain Nixon the first pick of Nazi wine stash in Bavaria, Germany.  That was priceless.  Also, it follows the book nearly 100%.Fellow Amazon.comers, you will enjoy this DVD.  The Airborne comes off as super tough volunteers.  The series shows good officers - like Williams and Lt. Spears (who is rumored to be a cold blooded murderer) - bad officers, and officers with problems, such as the ever drinking Captain Nixon.This video is worth the money."	5.0	It deserves 6 stars.

As someone who has served eight years in an airborne unit and a veteran of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Joint Guardian (Kosovo), I can truly say this film captures combat on many levels. The level of detail in each episode raises the bar for future combat films to try and reach. From Normandy on D-Day to Hitler's Eagles Nest, this film follows Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment throughout it's WWII experience. The characters are true to life and offer an inside look at what American Paratroopers dealt with during the war.

They go the next day. Then it goes to when the 501st was formed. The men of Easy Companyhad it rough. Nobody said that war was easy. It's a long, hard, slog through mud, snow, and tropical heat. However, since this is the ETO, (European Theater of Operations,) that this miniseries deals with, there aren't any jungles in Europe. General William T. Sherman, the famous Civil Warcommander, said it best. I can't think of a more fitting way toend this review than with Sherman's quote about war. &quot;War,gentlemen, is hell!&quot;	5.0	We happy few, We Band of Brothers	2004-06-14	7	3	4

However, if you're the kind of person who can't enjoy a show for what it is, preferring to pick everything apart in search of flaws, you'll probably find lots wrong with this one, too.

As a Persian Gulf veteran myself and a huge military history buff, I have nothing but love and the utmost respect for our WWII vets. The fact that the actors in the series are portraying real men, is very cool. I will always walk up and shake the hand of a gentleman wearing a WWII veteran hat, and sometimes they will talk about their accounts of the war, I'll just stand there and listen in awe. That's what we have here. Real accounts of what these brave men saw and went through.Much respect to the paratroopers of the 101st Airborne infantry. I can't even imagine what that must of been like on their first jump into France. Episode 2 shows this, terrifying and amazing.All in all, this is the best movie on WWII, that I've ever watched. Acted very well with pretty good effects as well. My hat off to Mr. Hanks and Mr. Speilberg. Definately a must see for any history buff like myself, and any true red blooded American.If any one ever questions why there is war, and ask why do our service members do what they do. Just watch episode 9 and you'll have your answer. So if you're ever out and see a veteran of WWII, thank and respect them. There aren't many of them still with us, and each one of them carries their own accounts of our U.S. history.	5.0	Band of Brothers....	2012-08-25	3	3	0

I'm definitely not a war expert, but I have watched many war movies with him and enjoyed quite a few of them. This however, wasn't one that I enjoyed.The series follows a company throughout their assignment in WWII, and it's beautifully photographed. The thing I didn't like about it was the story. It seemed like each episode had a different theme, one episode about the medic, one episode focusing on a soldier's fear, one episode where they deal with a concentration camp, etc. It sounds good in theory but it seemed really phony and stilted to me, as though the series was made specifically to be taught to schoolchildren. There are even extras on the DVD that explain what all the technical jargon was about, just perfect for a school assignment.None of the characters was really fully developed, so I never actually cared all that much what happened to any of them. They had to really exaggerate each character almost into a stereotype so you'd be able to tell them apart in their uniforms.I also didn't like the overuse of gore. I know these soldiers suffered horrible, shocking wounds, but the way the camera lovingly shows these things was just too much, like they were purposely just going for shock effect. Spielberg very effectively portrayed the horror and gore in the first scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" here it just seems like a schlocky horror movie that doesn't work.I felt like they totally glorified the war, too, and at the end of the series most of the characters were portrayed as going seamlessly back into their American life without any problems. It was just all too earnest and heavy-handed for me, and everything was played too safe (except for the gore!)"	2.0	A Wife's View	2011-06-17	46	14	32

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2IGYM7K8MFJRC	Bo stergaard Jepsen	"I shall think, that most people considering buying this box set knows what ""Band of Brothers"" is about, so I'll sidestep that and move on another thing: the quality of the series.Obviously it is very well written, directed and produced. Everything's been made to almost perfection. The images are crisp, the colour tone is perfect, the sound is good. But then again, you would expect that wouldn't you? Considering the people involved in the making.The series is very well cast and I can honestly say that I don't think there's even one case of bad acting in the entire ten episodes, which is actually quite rare. If I should say something, it would be that the casting of David Schwimmer is a bit off. He acts very well, but because of his ""Friends"" fame, I think one tends to associate him with his ""Friends"" persona. It's a minor thing, and as said, he acts very well.I've heard people say that they feel that they don't get to know any the characters and thus don't care what happens to them. I genuinely find that very hard to believe. Even with all the good things I've said about the production qualities of the series above, by far the best thing about ""Band of Brothers"" is that it truly is about brotherhood. You DO get to know the characters and you DO care about them, so much in fact that you sit there wishing you were there with them! Not because of the war, no, but because of these people and their friendship, their bond, their brotherhood. It is something that people who have never been to war can't fully appreciate I reckon, and we never will be able to. But ""Band of Brothers"" brings us one step closer to understanding it. No small feat indeed.It is without doubt the best TV series I have ever seen. It equals ""Stalingrad"" and surpasses ""Saving Private Ryan"" as far as WWII cinema goes.Highest possible recommendation."	5.0	The best thing ever to come to your TV screen	2007-05-02	2	1	1

The fact that an epic of this magnitude couldn't qualify the highest honors in cinema is tragic.Band Of Brothers follows Easy Company through its campaigns in the European theatre during World War II.  There are no punches pulled in this series.  The action is spectacular and horrific at the same time.  The acting is second to none.  You will be drawn into the lives and deaths of the Men of Easy Company.  The violence and war is as realistic in this series as it was in ""Saving Private Ryan"".  The difference being that you won't just be sad as a member of the company dies.  You'll feel as though you have experienced a true loss.Spielberg and Hanks do an incredible job bringing real life hero's to life on the screen, but the true gem of the series is the accounts of what it was like by the surviving men of Easy Company themselves.  Seeing them on screen and hearing them speak makes you feel the sorrow and the pride all the more.Block out some time to really get into this series, as it is best experienced in one sitting.  It will emotionally drain you, but at the same time it will make you wish that you could shake the hand of every man in Easy Company and every other company that has fought on behalf of all of us.  It will also make you appreciate the country that we live in even more."	5.0	A war epic too large for the big screen....	2005-01-11	8	7	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AR8Y6VPVUHCSB	"Brad Torgersen ""Full-time nerd, part-time sol..."	"In short, the entire series is one, huge film following the true-life epic story of men from the 101st Airborne who fought in Europe during World War 2.  The acting is wonderfully understated.  No superstars taking over the show here.  Dialogue and sequencing are authentic.  Fans of ""Saving Private Ryan"" will immediately appreciate ""Band of Brothers"" for its uncompromising look into the very darkest heart of the war.  But ""Band of Brothers"" seems even better than ""Saving Private Ryan"" if only because, this time, the script is based on reality.  The men who live and die on screen, really did live and die, as shown, and the gripping nature of this film is a testament to the real and brave heroics of those who stood against one of the greatest political and military menaces of the modern age.  Those who carp or complain about the film ""glorifying"" warfare simply miss the point.  This is not a typical hollywood blockbuster.  This is not ""Top Gun"".  This is the real war as seen through the eyes of the real soldiers who fought it, and I found it awesomely moving since we see first-hand how tough the average American 'mongrel' trooper really is: the hell he went through protecting the freedoms we Americans now enjoy, the turmoil the war brought to his personal and professional life, and the ultimate sacrifice he often made for his nation, his unit, and his buddies in the trenches.  This film is not a love letter to war itself.  It is a love letter to the valor and strength of the common free man.  Though certainly not child's fair, I would recommend this film to any parent who has a child that loves ""Lord Of The Rings.""  Show your son or daughter the REAL heroes and epic warfare that rescued our world from a REAL army of darkness.On a personal note, I found the bonus ""behind the scenes"" DVD to be a real winner.  Some bonus CD's are crud, but this one is a must see, not only for the in-depth interviews with the real-life guys upon whom this series is based, but also for actor Ron Livingston's home movie of the ""boot camp"" the actors were put through prior to filming.  As an Army Reservist I found myself laughing to the point of tears at some of the stuff Ron and the other guys went through, and I also found myself shaking my head that these guys found their ten-day mini-Basic to be so ""tough.""  Hey guys, try the real thing--9 weeks plus however many extra weeks you do in your Advanced school!  Ouch!  Anyway, even my Army training experience pails next to what the original Airborne troops had to go through.  My hat is off to the men of Easy Company, who paved the way for those of us in later generations, and who stand as shining examples to us all of what real heroes are made of."	5.0	Perhaps the best WW2 film ever?	2003-12-31	7	5	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AXDU26Y2MBWKD	B. R. Benson	Stephen Ambrose is my favorite historian.  And after their successful partnership on Saving Private Ryan, Steven Speilberg and Tom Hanks reunite to fashion a visual of war that shows for the first time the bonds of these amazing men.  I am somewhat of a military historian myself and am mostly interested in tactic and strategy, technology and leadership.  Band of Brothers taught me about the soul of the men going into combat.  They are more than pawns on a general's map plot or a target in an enemy's scope.  This mini-series brings the thoughts and relationships of volunteers to the forefront of the battlefield.  These men from a generation that we all need to learn from understood that their life was less important then the overall good of the world.  Because of how they cared for each other, relied on each other, and believed in each other led them to a victory that assured the future of our democracy and allowed a future for millions to experience freedom.Band of Brothers weaves the interpersonal details with the situations of battle they where thrown into.  One of the most interesting aspects of the GI relationship is that of the replacement.  The men who were called to the frontlines later in the conflict were not welcomed into the &quot;brotherhood&quot; to the same extent as those who had been together for so many months/years.  A personal attachment to someone new would take time to develop, something that was impossible on the front line.  And something that could end in heartache as replacements died with greater frequency than their more experienced brothers.If you want a to be introduced to the character of an American, buy Band of Brothers.  Though the mini-series is brilliant, read the book... there's so much more to it than even 10 hours of TV can recreate.	5.0	A recreation that gets it right... and personal	2004-05-14	6	6	0

I'm watching this on a sony 1080p 42"" tv and Yamaha receiver for audio. Right away I noticed the clarity in the audio, the new audio improvements are obvious on my setup and that's where the all the goodness begins. As for the improved picture quality, my bluray player up converts rather well but in the first few minutes of the first episode, where Sobel picks the loose thread of Lipton's shirt from his new chevrons, you actually see the thread, and I was sitting 6 feet away, later on in other episodes you see the beads of sweat on some of the characters faces and can read the names on uniforms etc. I immediately popped the dvd version in the bluray player and couldn't see any of this on the dvd version, up converted by the player or the receiver which both do decent up converting. The added clarity in the audio, sharpness and detail in the picture makes watching this series over very worth while.Highly recommended, if you enjoy the series already, I won't try and convince you to like the show itself if you already don't but if you do like it the bluray version is worth it over the dvd box set, hell it's even worth it to get a bluray player to watch it if you already like it :-)"	5.0	The best reason to have bluray	2009-01-26	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1AXKCK64VG4TJ	Brett S. Provance	I've been through episodes 1-3. Historical information is good overall; a better background as to why the invasion was necessary and so late in the war would have strengthened the historical value. Camaraderie develops, and this is well-portrayed. Sometimes the American soldiers seem too world-sophisticated in portrayal and have the postmodern Hollywood swagger (the agreement by certain sergeant's not to serve under their commanding officer was an aspect of real-world ignorance; it was difficult to find merit in this scene); the thoughtful and candid reflections of the modern veterans at the beginning of each episode should be read back into the film's scenes. However, the film does exhibit that the soldiers had to be educated on certain matters before the invasion. German soldiers are objectified, and at times the film moves into war-buddy genre reminiscent of earlier post-WWII Hollywood productions, just more violence and language in this one. I will watch the remaining episodes, but there is a little less enthusiasm, especially after reading and viewing other materials this past weekend, which was the 70th anniversary of the D-Day Invasion.	4.0	Impressions	2014-06-08	0	0	0

We can all wag our heads and say, ""War is hell,"" but the remarkable portrayal of these true stories, filmed by a production whose stated goal was to be as accurate as possible in every way, brings it home for me in a way that neither Hollywood, nor the press, nor the tales of returning veterans ever could.But it's not just those laudable results that make it happen.  It's the characterizations of such standout individuals as Winters, Garniere, Nixon, Compton, Toye, Spiers, etc., the real heroes (although they shun the word) who eagerly went forth to slay the Nazi dragon and got burned, to varying degrees, in the process.  I am grateful that we live in an age when such bravery is given its due, rather than that of 30 years ago when it drew suspicion.We live the war with these characters, from their soul-killing boot camp at the hands of possibly the worst company captain you could imagine (played brilliantly by David Schwimmer---yes, THAT David Schwimmer, clearly nobody's ""Friend"" here), to the nervous jump under fire over Normandy, to the firefights in the forests and fields of France and Holland, to Hitler's vaunted Eagle's Nest.  Our innocence and enthusiasm are shattered and rebuilt just like theirs, and our view of war, even of life itself, is forever altered in the process.  Thankfully for the viewer, we are not as deeply haunted as these fine men.Having watched the series a couple of times, the only nitpicks I have are that the primary military advisor on the series was a Vietnam vet who, I am told, wrongly approved two anachronisms:  The amount of foul language was much less among WWII veterans than presented here, and the extensive hand signals were not in use by the paratroopers whose story this is.  Both would be very familiar to him from 'Nam, a generation later, but don't belong in this WWII arena.Other than that, I have only praise and heartfelt thanks for this terrific 11-hour panorama of man's inhumanity to man and man's mechanisms for coping with same.  It'll be a long time before anyone can match ""Band of Brothers"" in its scope, feel, and impact."	5.0	At last I understand	2004-05-07	7	6	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2XTCUP17ORFTY	"Brian McKenzie ""bpmckenzie82"""	This series is by far, one of the best accounts of World War II that I have ever seen. As everyone else has stated, it is probably so good and realistic, because the events, the people, and the action actually occurred some 60 years ago.This movie exemplifies the attention to detail that is evident in other Steven Speilberg movies. It is interesting that Speilberg chose to produce the film version of the book. Private Ryan, from &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; belonged to the 101st ABN Division, which is the unit that is chronicled in the movie.I felt that the interviews that were shown at the beginning of each episode helped to humanize the events that occurred. I felt that it was amazing that anybody could survive the horrific events that the men of Easy Co survived, let alone live 60 years to talk about it.	5.0	Wow!	2004-04-13	3	3	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2Z37CYQVPR3LL	Brian W Robinson	If you want the whole story of Easy Company read the official unit histories, but if you want an emotional and pretty accurate telling of that unit's experience from training in 1943 until it's last action at the end of the war this is great storytelling.It has the look and feel of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; for obvious reasons (i.e. Hanks/Speilberg).  At times it has an almost documentary feel to it and I think that helped the series a lot.  The uniforms, weapons and gear are all pretty accurate.  There were a few things pictured in the movie that simply never happened or never would have happened (i.e. all of the guys huddled around the jeep singing songs after they take the town of of Foy - - I read an interview with Carwood Lipton (the Donnie Walberg character - - sadly he passed away shortly after the series was released) and he said it was the most glaringly inaccurate scene in the series), but the serious on the whole &quot;gets it right&quot; far more often that not. Even the casting was well done - - the actors all resemble the actual guys they portray circa 1943-45.  The history here is the real drama -- there's no need for phono BS Hollywood add-ons . . . the story of these men and what they did is incredible enough.Stephen Ambrose borrowed heavily from some earlier works that detailed this unit's history and it's combat record in the war when he wrote the book and the surviving members of Easy Company held him to a pretty high standard as far as getting the story right so the history is all there.  The series is a pretty good condensation of the book as well - - probably about as good a job as anybody could have done in turning a book into a mini-series.There were lots of combat units that endured the same sorts of hardships and made the same sacrafices as these men, but the story of the 101st Airborne, 506th PIR, 2d Battallion, Easy Company is a great microcosm of the whole story of the war on the Western front in Europe.Truly a great series worthy of all the acclaim in received.	5.0	Great Series - Good History	2003-01-07	3	3	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2BPTW7O4NERMM	Bruce Kehl	I rate this DVD pack as 4.5 with a tilt towards 5.It is simply a very hearty well-characterized series, that plays out the evolvement of the Band over the course of 4 years ... from Basic Training in the States through D-Day to the Bulge, sweeping into Germany, concentration camps and the eventual liberation of Berlin.  Although obviously made for TV and not the big screen, it's a &quot;followup&quot; of Saving Private Ryan by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks .A distinct highlight is the Extra Features, especially the interviews of the actual surviving members of the Band ... who still carry so much of the feelings and memories of their days over there.  Our thanks to all our fathers and mothers who did their best to keep this continent free from blatant insane oppression.The impressions - many very deep - that this series left with me are too many to relate here, but I strongly suggest that we all go out and buy this keeper, for ourselves and future generations.  Like the documentary series &quot;The World at War,&quot; this is a must buy.

The series itself is the quintessential story of a company of men going from basic training to combat during World War II. The best as far as I'm concerned. When my wife and I recently bought a Blu-ray theater system I decided I might start replacing a few discs but assumed they would probably be just Sci-Fi. I was glad I happen to spot this series while looking through the Blu-ray section. I couldn't beleive how reasonably priced this set was on Amazon. I immediately ordered it and the quality is astounding. You won't believe how real the picture and sound are even though they were remarkable with the original set. It truly looks like there is depth to the picture and if you have surround speakers it will blow you away. Superb quality DVDs with many extras including interviews and commentary by members of Easy Company. Don't miss out on this set if you enjoy dramas and if you have a friend or family member that enjoys war movies, I strongly urge you to get it for them.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2S2TPENIQ7XPY	Cameron	After witnessing Saving Private Ryan, I never thought war film could get better. While this isn't a film, it still deserves to be the greatest war motion picture ever. The main reason I believe this is better is simply, the length. With 2 and a half hours, as in SPR, you really only get the look and a small hint of the soldiers lives. 10 episodes covers so much more about the characters personality and lives. Where they have been, what they will do after the war and how it effects them each psychologically. After watching it on TV, I felt so sad that it was over yet glad that the surviours were going home to thier loved ones. The instant that I heard it was going to be released on DVD, I reserved a copy. This series draws you in so much you get to know the characters, what they are like and how they reacted to war. It's an unparalleled look at what young boys had to go through to save us from the evil that was Hitler.As you would have noticed, I keep referring to Saving Private Ryan. The reason being that it looks similar to Band Of Brothers. As we think of most great War films early in cinema history like The Longest Day, they are in black and white. We associate war films with black and white because the films of that era were. So in post production they did colour diluting which gives the feel of black n white in colour. It's a very effective way of manipulating your mind into thinking you're there. As far as the DVD itself is concerned, it's packaged beautifully and the extras are awsome. Hours and hours of behind the scene stuff which is what I love. It also contains a 1 and a half hour interview with the soldiers themselves. It's a moving experience to listen first hand, to the unbelievable stories told with such emotion.Anyone who is a history buff or just into war movies, needs this in thier collection. A true masterpiece. Many people ask me why I take great joy in films about so much suffering. It took me a while to answer that question myself. But I now realise that our way of honoring the great veterens and the poor souls who perished, is to understand what they had to go through. They did it so we don't have to. Band Of Brothers is a truly great achievement and will be remembered as the great war story of our lives.	5.0	WOW!!!! Better than Saving Private Ryan!!	2003-06-13	3	3	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AY3MDYZR9WW6E	Canoeist	"Mon Jan 10, 11:29 am ETDick Winters, WWII hero of `Band of Brothers,' diesDick Winters, a highly decorated World War II hero who became a household name when his heroics were chronicled in a Stephen Ambrose book that later became the HBO miniseries ""Band of Brothers,"" has died. He was 92.A very private and modest man, he died last week but requested that the news be withheld until after the funeral, a family friend told the Associated Press.After enlisting in the Army on Aug. 25, 1941, the Pennsylvania native enrolled in Officer Candidate School, eventually being commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in 1942. He was assigned to the 506th regiment of the 101st Airborne Division -- known as Easy Company -- and was deployed with his regiment to land by parachute in France on D-Day, June 6, 1944.By leading the takeover of a German artillery bunker on Utah Beach, Winters and his company saved countless lives from relentless cannon fire -- an action that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest honor an American soldier can receive. Winters and Easy Company later fought near the Belgian town of Foy during the Battle of the Bulge, liberated the German concentration camp at Dachau, and occupied Hitler's mountainside retreat, Eagle's Nest.In 1945, one of Winters' soldiers, Floyd Talbert, wrote a letter to Winters from his hospital bed to express appreciation for his leadership in battle.""You are loved and will never be forgotten by any soldier that ever served under you,"" Talbert wrote. ""I would follow you into hell.""Shaken by what he experienced in war, Winters reportedly vowed to live a simple life if he managed to survive, and that's just what he did. After returning home, he married his then-girlfriend, Ethel, bought a farm in Pennsylvania and raised a family. He reportedly never talked about his war experiences until Ambrose came calling in the hopes of documenting Easy Company's role in winning the war. Winters said he honored Ambrose's request because he felt it important for future generations to learn about the war, its consequences and the sacrifices made by soldiers. He later wrote his own memoir, ""Beyond Band of Brothers.""Winters was leading a quiet life of farm retirement in Hershey, Pa., when ""Band of Brothers"" turned him into a minor celebrity. People who knew him say that he never really became comfortable with life in the spotlight. He had fielded countless requests for interviews and personal appearances over the past decade or so, most of which he turned down.Winters was, by all accounts, exceedingly modest. When someone would ask him whether he considered himself a hero, he would usually respond by saying, ""No. But I served in a company of heroes."" Chroniclers of the World War II era, however, such as legendary NBC newsman Tom Brokaw -- who detailed the lives of Winters and others like him in his ""Greatest Generation"" series of books -- beg to differ.""Dick Winters was the quintessential American infantry officer -- brave, canny and modest,"" Brokaw told The Lookout. ""His heroic leadership of the Band of Brothers is a one-man course on how to become a warrior without losing your humanity.""****************************************************************Oldest living member of 'Band of Brothers' diesBy Timberly Ross  Associated Press - Sat Jan 22, 5:52 pm ETOMAHA, Neb. - A member of the ""Band of Brothers"" who fought in some of World War II's fiercest European battles, Ed Mauser shunned the limelight and kept his service with the Army unit a secret, even from some of his family.His role came to light only after his brother-in-law got him a copy of the HBO miniseries ""Band of Brothers,"" said Terry Zahn, who met Mauser during a 2009 Honor Flight trip to Washington, D.C., to see the World War II memorial. Mauser, who died Friday, told his family that some of the things in the miniseries, like the locations of buildings, weren't quite what he remembered from being there in person.But before that, ""he never talked about it for years and years and years,"" said Zahn, president of the Midwest chapter of the 101st Airborne Division Association.Mauser, 94, was the oldest living member of Easy Company, which is often better known now as the ""Band of Brothers.""Born Dec. 18, 1916 in LaSalle, Ill., he was drafted in 1942 and volunteered for the 101st Airborne Division. He was assigned to Company E, 506th Regiment -- Easy Company -- which participated in the D-Day invasion of France and the follow-up Operation Market Garden. The 101st also helped defend Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge.Historian Stephen Ambrose interviewed Easy Company leader Dick Winters for the 1992 book ""Band of Brothers,"" upon which the HBO miniseries that began airing in September 2001 was based. Winters, of Hershey, Pa., died earlier this month at age 92.The miniseries followed Easy Company from its training in Georgia to the war's end in 1945. Its producers included actor Tom Hanks and director Steven Spielberg.Mauser was not among the soldiers portrayed in the miniseries.Zahn said he kept his service a secret, even from his relatives. After it became known, he reunited with some of his Army buddies and made a few public appearances. He preferred to stay out of the limelight.""Don't call me a hero,"" Mauser told the Lincoln Journal Star in a 2009 interview. ""I was just one of the boys. I did what I was told, and let's leave it at that.""Mauser had been fighting pancreatic cancer, Zahn said. Heafey Heafey Hoffmann Dworak & Cutler funeral home in Omaha confirmed his death.Mauser was preceded in death by his wife, Irene. He is survived by a daughter, Laurie Fowler of Omaha. She did not immediately return a message left Saturday by The Associated Press.A funeral service is scheduled for Wednesday in Omaha. Mauser will be given a military burial at Calvary Cemetery."	5.0	Farewell Brother	2011-01-11	3	3	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A282A0P69UT137	"Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower"""	"""Band of Brothers"" is without a doubt one of the greatest and most monumental mini-series ever to be shown on television.  When you see most war movies, you see a film about one battle, or one campaign, and its only two or three hours long.  With this mini-series format, you see around 12 hours of film that spans a couple of years of war.  Thus, you get a great deal more depth and detail than you do from a standard war movie.The series is about one company of the 101rst Airborne Division during World War II, and follows that company of men from the time they are trained in the U.S., to their deployment to Britain, to the Normany Invasion, through the campaign to liberate France, during the Battle of the Bulge at Bastogne, and through the invasion of Germany to the end of the war.  Many of the episodes focus on one person of the unit as a sort of primary character, as he interacts with the others.  But through it all, the viewer gets an inside, no bull look at war at its worst, and the complex relationships that develop between men who face it together.This mini-series was the brain child of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, but is based on the book by the same title and subject by Stephen Ambrose, one of our most gifted World War II popular historians.  Ambrose is able to bring the story of World War II to life from the soldiers' point of view, in this book, and others such as ""Citizen Soldiers"", through his extensive interviews with veterans.Hanks and Spielberg have faithfully taken that work, and they along with their cast and crew have produced a monument to the American soldier of World War II.  This mini-series is a must see for any history buff, historian, student, any American in general, and any human being interested in a moment in time when, as the tag line for the series says, ""ordinary men were asked to do extraordinary things."""	5.0	"""Ordinary men were asked to do extraoridinary things."""	2002-08-12	10	10	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2FTHCGH06O4Y5	Caraculiambro	"This was very watchable at the time I went through it, but it fails a critical test:  I wouldn't watch it again.I think the core problem is that it's not about anything.  Unlike other war novels I'm aware of (Naked and the Dead, All Quiet on the Western Front, Catch-22), this novel has no central theme, no central concern, no ""message"" -- if you will.I'm not sure if I'm articulating myself well, so here's what I mean:  do you notice that EVERYTHING happens in this series?  Yeah, everything happens to everybody, so you are free to conclude whatever you want from its contents.  There's a guy who loses his courage.  There's a guy who gets his courage.  There's a guy who sees the brutality of war.  There's a guy who doesn't.  There's a guy whose life is ruined by the war.  There's a guy whose life is vastly improved.  There's a guy who's promoted.  There's a guy who's not.  There's a guy who is made wise by battle.  There's a guy who learns nothing.  Whatever you'd like to see in war, whatever you'd like to take from it, there's a guy in this series who pretty much does that for you.A failure on the writer's part!  Art should hone life, bring it into focus, distill it.  Not present it in toto.  If that's all you're doing, what do we need you for?  Just make a documentary and we'll draw our own conclusions."	2.0	so-so	2010-07-25	36	7	29

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1XPNGLXZEB51K	Cari L. Potter	I've wanted this series for such a long time because I love watching &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; when it's on HBO but it was always too expensive to buy +in the stores. Then I found this product on Amazon for such a great price and it was even on Blu-ray! I jumped on it. First of all, the series itself is absolutely amazing. It's filmed well, written well, great scenes, shots, sets, superb acting, the music great, etc. By far the best WWII drama I've ever seen. I love the story lines in each episode and how they are based on real events that happened as you follow Easy Company through the war. For someone like me who is not a huge WWII buff and doesn't know much about it, this film really gave you an idea of what it might have been like and showed you so many different aspects and angles of the Atlantic-side of the war. It takes you all over Europe and the scenery is absolutely amazing! I loved the veteran mono logs before each episode--hearing these old guys talk about their experiences really made the whole story so much more real and gave the series a sense of reverence, respect, and foreboding. I have several favorite episodes, but my all time favorite is, &#34;Bastogne&#34;. I loved seeing and feeling the war through the eyes and emotions of the combat medic. As a disclaimer, I would warn viewers not to watch all ten episodes really close together--because it can get really depressing. I mean, individually, the episodes are great with excellent drama, action, humor, and tension. But we are talking about a real war here and Easy Company took a lot of hits, emotionally and physically. The episode where they discover the Holocaust work camp is a really tough one to take--if you're sensitive to cruelty and human suffering like me, maybe read the content synopsis beforehand so you know what you're in for. THIS SERIES IS DEFINITELY NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN! I would say maybe a mature 15-year-old could handle it. Other than that, this is a really great mini-series. The special features are totally awesome and I loved the timeline and map features on each disc that allowed you to follow Easy Company through each episode--that was really cool and useful if you are interested in how these individual events and battles played a part in the overall picture and how they affected the war effort. I also was excited to see that subtitles were available! Sometimes it was hard to understand the dialog with all the different accents and background war noise. Watching the series with subtitles really clearing up some of what was going on for me. The discs come in a long, cardboard and plastic casing that folds accordion-like and fits nicely in this durable, heavy metal box. There is also a flap that holds a pamphlet about the series. The box is easy to open and is secure when closed. I was very pleased with the packaging. Overall, a great product and well worth the price!	5.0	OMG This was awesome!	2013-08-18	1	1	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3VVIHLCG0ZOAC	"Carl Elders ""Carl"""	"This is a show that combines WWII melodrama with modern teen-TV dramas to create a horrid mixture of bad acting and war-glorification.  It makes war look like a paid vacation with your buddies.  Also: it waaay overglorifies American soldiers, who were far from being the best soldiers in the war.  None of these characters/soldiers would have held up for 24 hrs. on the eastern front.I was never given any reason to care about any of the characters.  Some were so cuddly ""terry bear"" ish that it was sickning.  This is a perfect example of America's isolation for the realities of the rest of the world and of war in general.There is no real pathos or drama here, only blood and gut scenes and melodrama(much much more melodrama than B&Gs;).  The story is very poorly written and tries to deal ""sensitively"" with too many different characters.Makes you feel like war is something the Beverly Hills 90210 teens did on their spring break."	1.0	WWII meets Beverly Hills 90210	2004-09-14	246	26	220

This story is so well done it almost matches the book and have never saw a film that I could say that before now.  The book did tell me a few more things not in the movie but only small, minor details.  Unbelievable.  I don't watch movies more than twice.  I have watched these disks 4 times each.

Some survive to the end of the war, many do not.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	ADIXNR5122Q02	Casey	My father was 22 years old when he left Philadelphia and joined the army in the spring of 1942 he volunteered for the 101st, in the summer of 1942 he left Philadelphia and found himself at Camp Toccoa, he was not in Easy Company, I don't know the name of his company.He was a sergeant and squad leader he named his squad &quot;Maguire's Magpies&quot;.  He fought in France, Holland and Bastogne. Out of the original squad of 12 that landed in Normandy only 4 men survived the war, 8 men were killed in action during the following twelve months. And 6 of the replacements were killed in action as well.  He himself received 2 Purple Hearts, the original squad and the replacements endured 150% casualities.My father died in 1988 so he'll never read the book, or see Band of Brothers.  When I was young I would pump him for information about the war, he told me everything. We discussed his experience at length, over the years he told me all the details. So much so, that when I read the Ambrose book it was like I had already read the book.  But I wasn't prepared for the visual images in the Band of Brothers, I was overwhelmed, the intensity and the brutality of what my father and his fellow soldiers experienced brought me to tears. This production is a fitting tribute to the ultimate sacrifices that these young men made.My father traveled to Europe for business frequently in the 60's and 70's. He would take time on this trips to visit France, Holland and Belgium, he would locate that certain village, and find that particular farm field or forest where one of his &quot;brothers&quot; had fallen, he never forgot how special and exceptional these young men were.My father is still the most exceptional human being I have known in my life, seeing this production gave me a great insight to his personality. He was a person who truly appreciated what life had to offer, he was active, loving, funny and always emphasized the positive.  Those thirteen months in 1944-45, gave him an understanding of humanity that few of us possess.	5.0	Surviving World War II	2004-01-31	39	38	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AZX5MV3QA7BOV	Cat W.	Right off the top - good looking men in uniform all over the placedoing manly things.I originally bought this as a VHS set at a thrift store to give to my brother. I do not have cable, so I decided to give it a whirl. I was not expecting much but a modern standard war movie that would probably turn me off. Not so. Being that it is based on true events, I found it fascinating.The characters are fairly well-developed for as many as there are, though  I had a hard time figuring out who some of them were in relation to where I had seen them either earlier or later in the series.I read a review online somewhere that said they had the same issue with it and that there was too much backdrop that it interferes with the characters. However, they had a lot of people in that company and they had to fill this one out with more characters than most people are used to seeing in one film.I have now watched this 10 times and I am keeping it in my collection. Every time I watch it, I pick up on more and understand the characters and their situations a little better. I read somewhere else that another viewer's experience was greatly enhanced by reading the book along with the series.The authentic detailing of the sets and the props really gave me some historical perspective on what that time period was like as it pertained to war. I learned much about the logistics of WWII, being largely uneducated on the subject.The camera work is amazing as well and you can tell that Spielberg had something to do with the way this movie came out as an artistic piece.The special effects are pretty good too.There are also some really humorous scenes complimented by camera angles that I still like to watch. The acting is also superb in this film. Mathew Settle is one of the most handsome actors I've ever seen and does a great job of playing the effective, cool and collected Lt. Spiers.I enjoyed the fact that there are interviews of the veterans who were actually in this company and talk of their experiences. A whole segment is dedicated just to them as well as having some shorter interviews before episodes.Being a woman, the violence in it is not too bad - not like the serious blood, guts, and gore you see in other adventure or horror movies. However, it still gives you a realistic look of how horrible war is in terms of overall death and destruction.I'm still wondering where they got the very thin people to play the concentration camp prisoners. I guess I am going to buy the DVD set for the extras and special features next.	5.0	As A Woman, I Really Love This Series	2008-10-07	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A17N23WXA7EAF	"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter"""	"""Band of Brothers"" is an excellent docudrama of the 101st Airborne Division, Easy Company's training, and military exploits including D-Day, the failed Operation Market Garden, triumphant survival during the Battle of the Bulge, and subsequent forays into Germany and Austria until the Allied victory in World War II. The series contains an excellent format in which each episode is preceded by the accounts of aged Easy Company veterans who both set the tone for the drama that follows and who remind us that (unlike ""Saving Private Ryan""), this is not a Hollywood adventure film-it's the real thing. Each episode is based on a true story and none of the characters in this series is fictional.The DVD series also contains some excellent supplementary material. Each episode also includes a brief summary, biographical information of the principle individuals, and historical details about World War II, the American military, and maps that pinpoint Easy Company's progress.The most remarkable aspect of this series is that it allows us to witness life in Easy Company from a variety of situations including training, leave, deployment, and combat, as well as a variety of perspectives. We see the entire life of the company from the lowest ranking soldier, to the executive officers and we experience issues ranging from killing and surviving on the battlefield to navigating through the thick military bureaucracy.Not surprisingly, the most sympathetic people in this series are the non-commissioned officers who provide the actual leadership of the company under all circumstances. When Easy Company is lead by competent field officers such as Winters, Compton, and Spears, the NCOs simply augment their effectiveness with their own professionalism and understanding of the day-to-day realities of their men. In some situation, however, Easy Company is lead by incompetent officers such as the hapless Lt. Dike who (like our President) is given command because of his connections but proves vacant and cowardly during a crisis when leadership is most needed. In such situations, command of the company unofficially and almost unnoticeably falls to the NCOs who must hold things together and make them work in place of the leadership needed from above.Equally as interesting is the mindset of Easy Company. Veterans who have survived training and battles together command the respect of green replacements. Even returning veterans, who have missed out on a battle or two because of their wounds, are not given an instant welcome but must prove themselves on the battlefield again.""Band of Brothers"" inevitably contains many dramatic moments since it examines battlefield heroism, survival, fear, despair, killing, and the horror of seeing your buddies die. Unlike ""Saving Private Ryan"" however, this series manages to be dramatic without being melodramatic. ""Band of Brothers"" simply recounts events and explores some of the feelings behind those events and fortunately, it does so without moralizing or sentimentalizing as ""Saving Private Ryan"" wound up doing.After watching this series I came to see the ""greatest generation"" of World War II veterans in a new light. It's not so much that they were better than our generation or that we are worse than theirs. It's just that they had great leaders and a just foreign policy, which motivated them to unite and make sacrifices for the greater good. Unfortunately there is no such leadership or foreign policy in place today. Consequently, despite the fact that Americans are hungry to serve their country in a meaningful way, they simply can't unless they figure it out on their own. You see, right now, we are all under the leadership of Lt. Dike and the only thing he's good at is serving himself or chickening out during combat."	5.0	"Amazing Series--Much Better than ""Saving Private Ryan"""	2005-10-03	19	6	13

Beautifully constructed, written, and acted it is, in my view, the best of all the cinematic accounts of the war.  The episode where Easy Company stumbles on a concentration camp is dramatically chilling and, then, tragically complex in its outcome.  Around June 6 each year, take some time to see, hear, and remember how tyranny was crushed and a democratic way of life was preserved, at great cost.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2RMULBTR8NF57	Chancellor R	I have spent my entire life in the study of American history, and the wars of the 20th century.  While many Movies on those subjects are entertaining, most are sorely lacking in historical accuracy.  Band of Brothers however succeeds at every level.  The accuracy of the historical details is amazing to begin with.  That is put together with a story line that pulls you in and leaves you wanting more.  You connect with  the charecters, and feel for them as they go through their trials and tragedy. It was everything I personally could ask for in a television program. The documentary episode that ties all those aging veterans together with the characters brought to life on film (actually them), and the stories they told, was very poignant, and powerful.It was the perfect closure for their true story.	5.0	One of the finest pieces of film on the second world war	2007-01-23	8	7	1

And there's a lot of good stuff out there: Charles Guggenheim's D-DAY REMEMBERED, Thomas Lennon's THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, THE LONGEST DAY, PATTON, A BRIDGE TOO FAR, and many, many more. In English language film (based on what I've seen--I've got to work and sleep, too, you know...), I can only think of Ken Burns' THE CIVIL WAR and Herbert Wise's I, CLAUDIUS, as being close in quality and ambition.	5.0	Clearly the Best Film Treatment of WW2	2005-03-04	9	5	4

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1LKX9ZOGV5CWC	Charles Falk	I got a copy of this in Switzerland, which does not include any of the extras - just the 10 episodes, which is already easily worth the price.  I wish I could see the extras.The miniseries is an absolutely fantastic show.  The realism is absolute, and it is amazing to see the faces of the actual survivors of Easy Company confirming at each episode that what you see happening - worthy of the finest Hollywood fiction screenwriters - actually happened for real.  These guys have &quot;seen the elephant&quot;, so to speak.  Some survived, many did not.I find myself grateful to HBO for this series, just like with the similarly stellar miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, they have reached back and plucked from history the actual motivations and personalities that drove those events.  In the case of &quot;Band Of Brothers&quot;, this is even more pressing and urgent, as those guys who remember those events will not be with us much longer.  So I am grateful that HBO has taken the time, money and most importantly the care to tell these stories as they actually happened, before the experience is lost to us all.These men sacrificed years of their lives and went through hell itself.  Many did not survive (in fact it is appalling to read, at the end of some episodes, the sheer number of casualties the Airborne suffered - 50% or more at every major engagement).  And they did this simply because their nation asked them to do it, leaving their homes, jobs and families to do so.  Does today's generation have what it takes to do it again?	5.0	HBO is making this a habit?  Good thing, too.	2003-06-12	6	6	0

I'm not a fan of HBO because I find shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Sex And The City"" to be nothing but trash but the network really outdid itself with ""Brothers"". My Russian born wife was messmerized by the series and could not wait to watch the next DVD.I recently read the Stephen Ambrose book and the series follows it very closely even right down to the scene where the German  waiter takes off when Winters and Welsh enter the Berchesgaden Hof dining room. I was especially intrigued by the scene where the C-47's were approaching the DZ and the viewer was treated to a cockpit view of the AA fire in the distance.Yes, the language was raw and the combat scenes were extremely violent but that made ""Brothers"" all the more historically accurate. I'd recommend it to most anyone and found it to be a wonderful tribute to a generation of men that is quickly leaving us."	5.0	Messmerizing	2004-02-26	3	1	2

The episodes, from basic training to The Eagle's nest are all great -- the best being ""Bastogne"". This series will be required viewing for my son before sending him out to make his way in the world. It teaches about perseverance, bravery, sacrifice, and the brotherhood that can only be formed in the crucible of war. I have been spared this in my lifetime and I hope he will be, too, but other men still experience it in Iraq as I write. Parents should be advised that the series is not appropriate for young children as there is a lot of battlefield violence & profanity. There is also one brief, gratuitous sex scene that should have been left out (Spielberg also did this in Schindler's list). Overall, however, the good far outways the bad in this great series.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3RRBPUGD7UOSP	"chemikalguy ""chemikalguy"""	This has to be, in my opinion, one of the best accounts of WWII ever produced. With modern computer technology and filming, this series is like an 8-hour Saving Private Ryan, only better.The video quality is the reason I bought a DVD player. It is so crisp and clean, you'd swear you're right there in the trenches with the 506th. The audio is probably the best 5.1 sound of any DVD I own. They made use of the surrounds constantly throughout the series.  From rain and thunder to gunfire and mortars, they sounded spectacular.The ten episodes are extremely well written and acted. Each episode centers on a specific character and event in the timeline of the war. It follows E (Easy) Company, 506th Infantry, 101st Airborne as they train, parachute into, and fight their way through Europe on the way to their ultimate objective: Nazi Germany.The most compelling episode for me was 'Bastogne'. This episode follows a 506th medic as he scurries around from foxhole to foxhole trying to gather meager supplies, as well as treat the wounded. The episode purposely has a very frantic pace as he goes from man to man, trying to help where he can. The medic expends an immense amount of energy to try and save a life, only to see it snatched away. This symbolism is further demonstrated when the medic goes to a field hospital and meets a young French nurse.  The two of them build a repoire, and the seeds of love seem to be sewn. After spending time on the line, he returns to find that the hospital has been hit by artillery fire, and the nurse is dead. The nurse always wore a cloth over her hair to keep it in place, so the young medic takes it from her, a remembrance of sorts. He makes his way back to the line, only to find a man whose hand is cut badly. The medic, being out of bandages, reluctantly uses the only thing he had to remember the nurse by, the piece of fabric. Another instance of the symbolism used in this episode.I'd have to say that young people today should watch this with an open mind, and understand that this isn't Hollywood. This is fact. History. Everything in the episodes truly happened, and many of the men who did these things are still alive today. I think the younger generation hasn't had the respect for their elders, but maybe a viewing of this series could help to change that.	5.0	Younger Generation Needs To See This	2003-02-08	14	14	0

I would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that every time I start the thing it has to start right from the beginning of the episode and not from the place I stopped.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AYW65HBQV9SBX	Chilok	This is my 2nd contribution to my Blu-ray collect (1st being BBC Ed Planet Earth) and I cant tell you how proud I am to be an owner of the Band of Brothers!First impression the tin box was in perfect condition with embossed letters on it. as you open up the box there will be 6 disc which comes out in accordion style along with some really nicely designed photos from the scenes in B.o.B.In a nutshell, if you like Saving Private Ryan, you will love every bit about B.o.B. because it is an even more detailed version of S.P.R. What I liked about B.o.B. is that you get to not only feel how it's like behind the front line the world's biggest war, but you also get to see many different aspect of the war. How the group break apart when led by an inferior leader, or what it was like to be a combat medic in the front line, or how everyone mentally gets through the pressure from being attacked, or even the reality of how fragile life really is during the time of war.The image quality is unforgettable especially at the last few episodes :DOverall it's very very well done piece. I wished it was longer than 10 episodes but I think I can say that to all the good things in life :)	5.0	Must have if you are into War stories or Blu-Ray or just good stuffs	2009-02-20	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1FHPZNCHASU1Z	Chris Carter	I was fortunate enough to receive my pre-order early, so I thought I would share some thoughts on the actual DVDs. The series itself has more than enough reviews, but for those of you who are still undecided, I thought a review of the actual product might help.The discs come in a nifty little tin box which has a gatefold inside which holds the DVDs. Overall a very sturdy and attractive container. The presentation itself is quite nice. The picture is clear and sharp, and seems to be a very good transfer. One nice surprise is the presence of a DTS audio track, which is kind of unique for a series which played exclusively on cable TV. It does not possess the same sort of audio perfection displayed in Saving Private Ryan, but nonetheless it is a very good audio experience, especially for a made-for-TV product. The biggest difference I can tell is a slightly diminished use of the back surround speakers, but still, it is quite good and has moments of superb acoustic ambience. As far as the DTS vs. the Dolby Digital track, the DTS is noticeably clearer with the spoken dialog, and just generally sounds better.The discs also have a field guide feature for each episode. It displays, among other things, a list of the soldiers you will see in that particular episode. This can be very useful when everyone starts to look alike after a while. I haven't seen the bonus disc yet, but it looks like it will be interesting as well.Overall, I was very pleased with the entire set. It is a quality product with great video and sound, and will make a great addition to your DVD collection.	5.0	A word on the DVDs themselves...	2002-11-04	32	29	3

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2USC5JIGJ16SG	Chris Linke	I owned the DVD version of this, the most important mini-series ever. So when it arrive on Blu-ray, it was a must-buy. High definition greatly benefits the beautiful cinematography. The gritty, grainy look of the series comes across more clearly than on the DVD version.The new Blu-ray exclusive features are well worth the price. The picture-in-picture commentaries--which draw from interviews with the actual Easy Company soldiers that never made it into the previously seen documentary or episode intros--provide insight into the scenes over which they appear. And the interactive timeline feature further enhances the viewing will all kinds of extra information.In fact, my wife and I are enjoying our evenings spent watching an episode, then going back and watching it with the commentaries, then going back and running through the interactive timeline.	5.0	Even better on Blu!	2009-02-21	0	0	0

This bonding is what men were meant to do, not just in war, but in our every day battles.  The sense of brotherhood among people with only one major event in common is instructional.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A4LK6W5QCHE91	Chris Milligan	"Based on the book by Stephen Ambrose, ""Band of Brothers"" details the story of Easy Company in the 101st Airborne Division during World War II.  As most films do, it doesn't stay completely to the book, but it does very well in staying in harmony with the book and its accounts.All accounts and stories aside, this mini-series is extremely well made.  The scenes, while graphic at times, are something to behold.  The artillery shells screaming in, the tracers flying, and most of all, the great portrayal of a soldier done by each actor, make each scene feel real to the viewer.There really is no standout as far as the ""leader"" of the film.  Mainly because this is a movie about an entire company.  But the one that would probably take the honors is Richard Winters, played by Damian Lewis.  Throughout the series, you see his progression from Lieutenant to Major and the leadership he shows in the company, but still remains just another man in the company.Throughout the series, you will witness Easy Company from D-Day right through to the end of the war.  This includes events such as D-Day, Operation Market Garden, the Ardennes, among others.  The several parts of the series that are in the Ardennes are spectacularly made.  One thing that really sticks out in my mind with these different battles though, is that Easy Company and the 101st Airborne could have been glorified to be this unstoppable force that ran over Germany.  But they were shown to be human, shown in victory and defeat.  But also shown to be together.  As the name would bring out, their closeness and not wanting to lear each other down got all of them through some of the harshest fighting seen in World War II.With each passing year, more and more veterans from those battles leave us.  But those that are still here retell accounts at the beginning or end of each episode.  Seeing those men as they are and seeing their reality really strike a cord in you and make the film even better.  At the end of the series, you are shown the names of those being interviewed.  It really is funny, after you've seen the series and start seeing the real men's names, you point to the TV screen and say ""Look! It's Lip!""All in all, it's a great series.  Very well made in both the acting aspect and the reality aspect.  The only thing close to Rambo in this film is Ronald Speirs.  There are some great performances by the actors, such as Donnie Wahlberg playing Carwood Lipton, Frank John Hughes playing Bill Guarnere, and Rick Gomez playing the lovable George Luz.Check this one out, you won't regret it."	5.0	A great film about a great story...	2004-10-06	6	5	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2D1HDYM0DF1J5	Chris Myers	It is hard to describe this show in words, given that most people today did not experience the events firsthand. Many of us have heard stories from our family members or friends. What I can say, based on stories I have been told, is this show does a fantastic job of portraying the soldiers and their experiences during the war. It is produced by some of the same people who made Saving Private Ryan, and also uses many of the same filming locations. The actors do an excellent job of capturing not only the pain and suffering of their characters, but also the happiness and camaraderie the characters shared with one another. Be warned, this show is graphic, both in violence and profanity. It is not, however, only for the sake of shocking viewers. Instead, it is to convey the horrors that the soldiers of the 101st Airbourne Division experienced on a daily basis, in the most realistic manner possible. I recommend this show to everyone, pacifists and war-buffs alike. It is a vivid reminder of what our predecessors had to go through to ensure future generations would be free from the oppression of the Third Reich and the Japanese and Italian Empires.	5.0	Excellent show	2014-05-30	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AR3RAD2DPXBRN	Christopher Farrell	"Band of Brothers, Stephen Ambrose's book on E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne, is an interesting and engrossing read for those who already have some background on WWII. But, sadly, it's not history - more of a reminiscience by a few select members of the company. Ambrose uses appallingly few other sources to back up the narratives, tends to focus on the stories that are convenient, and generally takes the stories of the veterans without skepticism. Nontheless, in book format, that's OK, the book has merits to make up for it, and Band of Brothers (the book) succeeds.Band of Brothers (the miniseries), though, is shorn of its ""fireside chat"" style and is throwing you into the midst of this narrative and tries to convince you it is fact, that it can convey what it was like to be there; but it can't. It can't both because the underlying history is too sugar-coated and unreliable in general (there are exceptions, of course), and because the characters have no emotional resonance. They got the blow-up sequences down (leftover effects from Saving Private Ryan, presumably - the looks is almost identical), but the writing is uneven, being unable to make the transition for the storytelling style of Ambrose to real drama with any elan. You never really get to know more than a few of the characters the way the title might suggest, and there is no sense of jeapordy since we always have an instinctive sense that the characters we get to know are those that will survive, since they told their stories and contributed primarily to Ambrose's book.Despite my generally negative feelings, there are some good spots; the one episode that stood head and shoulders above the others was the Bastogne episode; even its calculated and gimmicky ending couldn't damage an otherwise excellent narrative, one where all the exposions complimented the excellent character work instead of being the main attraction (this episode was not in Ambrose's book).To boil it down, I supose, impressive explosions do not make good drama in and of themselves and neither do they convince you of the nature of war; the miniseries has lost the sense of its title. While good in spots, overall this does not have enough to recommend it."	2.0	Flaws in the book are magnified	2002-09-09	123	30	93

I am an ardent fan of WWII history so I've read the book and simultaneously watched the videos. It has been enjoyable, as much as one can enjoy the horrors of war. My dad fought in WWII and all this is very interesting to me as I try to understand him 27 years after his death. I highly recommend.

This series really delves into the inner workings of the soldier's mind and gives the viewer a good education in the many battles (both on and off the battlefield) that make up any war.  It's such an interesting concept to have the men who actually fought these battles talking about the war experience in individual interviews before and during each part of the series.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AS558SNWF1DXG	Clare Quilty	"This is an excellent adaptation of Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name -- epic, vivid, complex, sprawling, moving and brilliantly written, acted and directed.The series is lovingly faithful to the facts, so much so that repeat viewings not only satisfy, they enrich the overall story. At first, although I was riveted by the first enstallments, I wasn't able to distinguish all of the characters; I could follow the plot just fine, but basically we're talking about a story populated by a lot of young guys in helmets and fatigues.  On repeat viewings, you're able to see background characters who will later come into the foreground, and this gives the series a fascinating complexity.This is also a collection of excellent stories, made even more awe-inspiring by the fact that they're true.  The opening installment ""Curahee"" is a great prelude to the action, and a good introduction to the mindset of the men and what it takes to make a competent leader.  ""Carantan"" contains sequences as jolting as ""Saving Pvt. Ryan.""  And the stand-out episode, ""Bastogne,"" is so harrowing and exhausting and affecting it makes one wonder why wars are fought at all.  Of course ""Why We Fight,"" in which Easy Company uncovers a concentration camp, ably answers that question.One primary thought ricoched through my brain during this entire series: I am so glad I've never been in the situations those men were because I would've awful at it, I don't think I could've done it.  The secondary thought?  Gratitude that somebody else was able to do it."	5.0	Curahee!	2004-12-06	8	7	1

I couldn't determine the main character and was disturbed by the shifts in time ( let's start with 1944, let's go back in time, let's go forward in time, etc.) What is the plot ?  Why do we care about the characters ? What is their background ?  I expect to have clues to the answers to such questions in disc 1."	1.0	Band of Brothers	2004-08-25	201	9	192

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3ETGCGLFFYLZD	CloudMan	This was an easy 5 star rank for me.  I love WWII movies, but for every great one made, there are two that are tasteless or cheesy.  This is by far the best depiction of what it must have been like on the frontlines in WWII.  The interviews at the beginning of each episode with the actual men that the series follows was a beautiful touch.  Don't be surprised if you catch yourself with tears welling up in your eyes.Aside from being historically accurate, the 10 episodes have amazing cinematography.  The script lacks that overused American bravado that seems universal in any war movie with American forces in it.  Just ordinary guys who did extraordinary feats.If you are into movies like Saving Private Ryan (which I thought was poor), or god forbid...Rambo...you will probably not enjoy this collection.  However, if you want a realistic and powerful depiction of those unsung heroes of WWII that will leave you with a lump in your throat after each episode...this is it.I'll be watching this collection twice per year for the rest of my life.  Definitely worth the original retail price...and now with such a discount...what an easy buy.	5.0	Captivating...	2005-06-26	4	3	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A6YJXMMWFZR5P	Clyde A. Dodge	"The DVD release of ""Band of Brothers"" is an exceptionally high-quality home video product. For anyone interested in World War II or epic filmmaking, this is a must have.The set consists of six DVDs, five of which contain two episodes each. At first you may wonder where the audio and language options are when the main menu for each DVD appears. These menus appear once an episode title has been selected. The menu for each episode includes chapter selection, an episode summary, a variety of audio options, and in the package's only real failing, the option to have only Spanish subtitles or none at all. No English subtitles are available, so the hard-of-hearing or the script geeks (like me) who like to follow the text on the screen, will need to have TVs with built-in closed captioning.The sixth DVD includes the documentary that was aired on HBO about the real men of Easy company, as well as trailers for upcoming episodes. Additonal video features include the premiere of the series at Normandy, where the actual veterans of Easy Company were in attendance. It is great to see the actors together with men they portrayed.One feature found on every DVD, which I found incredibly useful, is the Field Guide. This has definitions of every military term used in the series. For those who have wondered about military ranks, this field guide has the complete listing of each rank, along with the appropriate isignia. Take a look at this before viewing, and the appearance of characters' uniforms will be much more meaningful.For those who saw HBO's Golden Globe/Emmy winning mini-series when it was telecast, this DVD will be a welcome way to revisit and savor this great depiction of a true story (or rather, multiple true stories). For those who have not seen it, this is the one HBO product to have. Forget ""The Sopranos,"" forget ""Sex and the City."" These are quirky products which are vastly over-rated by the critics. ""Band of Brothers,"" on the other hand, is a monumental achievement for television, rivaling the dramatic intensity of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and far surpassing every other war movie released since then except for ""Blackhawk Down,"" another true story. If you think that, because it was made for television, it will pale in comparison to its megaplex brethren, think again. ""Band of Brothers"" stages some jaw-dropping battle sequences, and follows the lives of a cavalcade of characters with deft skill. Acting, direction, editing, special effects, music...all are top-notch.A few riveting moments:Episode 2: Easy Company assaults and captures a German gun position that was firing on the landing parties at Normandy. The episode's epilog points out that this assault has become THE textbook example of how to attack a fixed position, and is still taught at military academies today.Episode 3: Easy Company holds the line against an armored assault by the Germans after the companies flanking them have fled the field.Episode 9: On patrol in the woods of Germany, Easy Company stumbles upon one of the great horrors of this or any war, a concentration camp."	5.0	Almost Perfect	2002-11-16	19	19	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3SV11NMS4IMCL	"C. Martin ""Krazy Taz"""	"I first watched Band of Brothers on TV as the HBO special.  After watching it a couple of times, a friend recorded the entire series and I was able to watch it for a second time, I knew I had to have the movie when they hit the streets.  I didn't care what it cost when it first came out and I bought it immediately.  Even though I still have the original DVD set, in great shape, I could not wait until the Blu Ray copy came out.  I added it to my collection almost as quickly as I bought the first set.I was impressed with the footage, the filming and the actors that played the roles.  I was so glad to see that they used lesser known actors for the most part as it allowed us to focus on the story and not the actors playing the parts.  Damian Lewis was an outstanding choice for MAJ Winters and I thought he did a tremendous job.  Like another reviewer pointed out, we have fewer and fewer WWII vets still around and so this movie gives us a chance to ""Walk a mile in their shoes"", so to speak.Each episode gave a quick story of Easy Company as they moved from Georgia, through Normandy, to Bastogne to Germany, where they were until the end of the war. Each episode gives us a feeling for what it was like and tried to show us the hardships they faced.  One of the features I really enjoyed was when the actual members of Easy Company told their story, generally at the beginning of the episode.A great movie and a definite ""Must Have"" for any video library."	5.0	Greatest War Movie - Quite Possibly	2011-12-20	4	4	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A29UD18INWS2DW	C. Moody	Theres a reason why this miniseries has a 5 star rating. I've seen it 4 or five times and it just gets better every time i watch it. Everything about it is awesome, Day of Days, Carentan and Crossroads are my favorite episodes, but they are all incredible, for the most part they are all written and directed by different people but the whole series is very cohesive and it all fits together perfectly. The insight from the veterans and the attention to authenticity make this an incredible series. What also makes Band of Brothers incredible is that the men portrayed in the series are real, they really fought and died, and it makes it much more of an emotional experience than Saving Private Ryan which had fictional characters. Don't get me wrong, SPR was great but for me Band of Brothers is more of an experience, you get so attached to these men that you really dont want to see them die, because they are real, that is really what made this special to me. The interviews with the vets before each episode are great introductions to what aspect of combat that particular episode was covering, and the thing that really got me was when at the end of the last eisode, they had some of the vets talk about it, and for the first time in the series it said who each man was, so you can see what they are like now, and you can see just how great the characters were cast.Overall this is pretty much the greatest war movie/series i have seen, nothing else had the same impact as this, and its pretty much a must have.	5.0	I've watched it 4 times...	2007-05-14	2	2	0

And I now I wonder why I waited so long to see this gripping saga.I am a history fanatic, and the story of Easy Company, 506th Battalion of the Screaming Eagles should have gotten my attention much sooner. It was superbly written, filmed, and directed. I felt like I was there suffering with them at Bastogne, or agonizing over Market Garden, and felt as if I just discovered concentration camps for the first time. Of all war films I have viewed, this seemed to give the most realistic view of war on the ground.The music score was Oscar worthy, and will probably surpass the theme from Gettysburg as my favorite war film theme song.What made the story even more real is the interviews of the real survivors of Easy Company and their memories. The respect they had for Major Winters shone through in the interviews and in the series.At the outset of this series I had a high respect for our veterans. At it's conclusion I have the highest respect for what they went through. They deserve to be remembered. This series is a good way to enshrine their memory and their deeds for posterity forever.	5.0	Why Did I Wait So Long?	2014-06-05	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2FIXGZLMD2D8K	C P Severson	This is simply the greatest production ever to appear on cable television, in my opinion. Moreover, the underlying historical reality guiding the narrative resonates in a way that transcends mere drama (however potent or poetically allegorical). These men were real heroes--no less heroic for having been real. I am sad that this generation of Americans has all but slipped into memory, and am profoundly grateful to everyone who contributed to make this beautiful, shocking, funny, melancholy, entertaining, thought-provoking, and inspirational tribute.	5.0	Superlative!	2014-06-14	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A23VM6TJ5QJUA8	Crackles McFarly	What bothers me MOST is how SLOW things go when it comes to the non-fighting parts of this series. I know war wasn't war 24/7 but I think 15 minutes of talking about girlfriends and missing the pet goat at the barn in each episode could have been replaced with some scenes about strategy and map reading planning.That's the sole complaint but trust me it is a 20% [4 out of 5 stars], Amazon should change it to 10 stars for the nuance of movie critiquing.We all owe these soldiers from World War 2 but  Europe owes them big time!	4.0	ACCURATE, well researched and humbling.	2014-06-19	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AIC7J32QZY2KF	Craig Moller	Hollywood masterminds Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks created an unforgettable 10 part miniseries based on the story of Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, U.S. Army. An extremely impressive, deeply engrossing, emotional and brutal look at combat during World War II and Easy Company following in their footsteps from boot camp till the end of the war. Easy Company took part in some of the most difficult battles, including the D-Day invasion of Normandy, the failed invasion of Holland, and the Battle of the Bulge, as well as the liberation of a concentration camp and the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest. Drawn from interviews with survivors of Easy Company, as well as soldiers' journals and letters, making this miniseries very accurate upon dates and events that happened. This miniseries is very moving and  captures the wide range of the realistic responses to the stress and trauma of war fear, cynicism, cruelty, compassion, and all-encompassing confusion.The writing, directing, and acting are superb throughout. The cast is largely unknown, emphasizing the team of actors as a whole unit, much like the regiment; Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston play the central roles of two officers with grit and intelligence. It's clear and is shown in this miniseries that the things these soldiers had to do are both terrible and understandable, and the psychological price they paid is made clear. This also brings forward that these wars brought out some incredible acts such as unbelievable courage and sacrifices in some people while bringing out the worst in others. Here it shows both and makes this an unforgettable moving experience. This miniseries is very moving and captivating and I highly recommend this, for it's a fantastic piece of work.	5.0	An unforgettable movie experience	2008-11-21	3	2	1

There isn't anything that I can find they did very wrong, from the casting to the screenplay, the acting directing and filming, all top quality.  It is unfortunate that the second series &#34;The Pacific&#34; wasn't nearly as well done and that HBO has stopped producing shows of this quality (everything now seems to be focused on how far can they take violence and sex).

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3OZSE3PRESXKH	C. Tracy	"*sigh* I knew it was coming, every time a war movie is made in the US the ""USA bashing"" is unleashed by our British lads.  Yes Britain had a signifigant role in winning WWII, nobody has said otherwise in any of these films.  But to bash on the US and ""Band of Brothers"" simply becasue there wasn't enough Bristish lads in it, well that's just sour grapes.  And let's address some of your blanket statments about US war films not portraying the British involvement in the war-(begin quote)""like many Brits I do find it quite annoying that all of these films portray the superhuman American's single-handedly sweeping all before them as they triumphantly storm all the way from Normandy, through France, Belgium and Holland and then finally into the Ruhr valley."" (end of quote) Well obviously you have not rented, ""A Bridge too Far,"" ""Guns of Navarone,"" ""Where Eagles Dare,"" ""Bridge Over the River Quai,"" ""Patton,"" ""The Longest Day,"" and others, or even the at- times-inaccurate ""Pearl Harbor"" movie with Ben Afleck (sp?). Well you get the point, in all of these films I've just named, the British contributions to the war effort were a primary focus within the movie, even if the movies were released here in the US.  Just because two war movies that you review ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band Of Brothers"" do not include British exploits, please do not make blanket statements about the US film industry.  Besides, ""Band of Brothers"" was about the 101st, not the British 1st Airborne Divison's ""Red Devils,"" therefore not many British faces make their way into the battle scenes because they never fought together anyway.  The closest the 101st came to fighting together with the British was fighting with the XXX Corps tanks, which was portrayed in the Market Garden episode.Well as I'm sure you have read a ""Bridge Too Far"" by Cornelius Ryan and know that the ""Red Devils"" took and held the Arnhem Bridge while waiting for the XXX Corps to arrive.  Your quote- ""Nobody is denying that the 101st and 506th Airborne divisions weren't involved, they were. But they didn't play the pivotal role by any means."" (end of quote) What book did you read?  If you understand the battle at all you'd know that the 101st took the bridge at Son, and the 82nd took the bridge at Nijmegan with substantial casualties, two of the three major bridges needed for victory were taken by US forces.  How can you say that the US had no ""pivotal role?""  And wasn't it your XXX Corps that stopped short of Arnhem and relief for the ""Red devils"" because they were brewing tea and waiting for infantry support?  The 82nd airborne pleaded with the XXX Corps to take their tanks into Arnhem and relieve their British paratrooper brothers, but it wasn't too be.  You did read the book didn't you?  My point is this, before you rip on US movies and the US in general, please get your facts straight.  Also, there were no British in Saving Private Ryan because Omaha beach was stormed by the US First Infantry Division, not the British, who were busy at Juno, Gold, and Sword beaches with the Canadians, and were ordered to take Caen, far away from the US axis of advance, therefore they weren't fighting together.  Good heavens man, we're not scared of the truth, but at least try to get your facts straight.  Oh yeah, I give Band of Brothers 5 stars. ;)  And Great Britain, I love ya, but take it easy on the US bashing, let's take off our Doc's, drink some tea, watch Mr. Bean together and relax."	5.0	To my British friend from jolly 'ol Cambridge	2002-08-21	122	93	29

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AA2FSPD0RBKB8	D. A. Cobb	Though, the previews of other HBO Blu-ray features at the beginning of the first disc are in a quality below DVD standards. While watching these previews, I had my fingers crossed that the BoB series would not be in such poor quality. Thankfully, it wasn't. HBO should fix this flaw. Yes, I know they are just previews...but still. I want quality all-around.Overall a superb mini-series everyone should watch. This is a war-drama series with little action. We're talking 90% talky with 10% war-action. And half of that 90% is actually just long glances and gazes--seriously. Yes, I am making fun of the series. But, when you break it down, it's mostly just a lot of starring (sp?) and open jaws.I wanted more action. Don't get me wrong, I love a good talky, but I felt a lot of the action scenes in this series are short-changed. I read The Pacific brings in more action. I'll have to check that series out.Also, the supposed worse times for Easy Company--their experience in Bastogne, which is span across two episodes, did not feel as powerful as it should, atleast to me. It felt kinda empty, though it did have some memorable moments.But overall, this is a SUPERB series with beautiful cinematography, acting, scoring, and directing that deserves the many awards it has gotten.And those two comrades, forgot their names, episode 2, right after landing in Normandy, who just met up after jumping, found an active AA nest. Why on earth didn't they take it out? There were only like 3 guys in it. One grenade could've gotten them all. I felt leaving that nest behind was a big fail and it bothered me.	4.0	Superb series!	2011-12-29	3	1	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A28WJUJF6D2ULA	Dai-keag-ity	"In recent years HBO has surpassed all other venues as the place to showcase quality productions, and with Band of Brothers, an arguably superior adaptation of Stephen Ambrose's extraordinary book of the same name, the network released a fine work indeed. Already considered a classic today a few short years after its initial broadcast, Band of Brothers builds on the tradition of Saving Private Ryan as it draws deeply from a reservoir of talent before and behind the camera to tell the story of the men who fought the Second World War as part of Easy Company in the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the celebrated 101st Airborne Division. As it follows this group of remarkable civilian soldiers from training in Georgia thru preparations in England for participation in D-Day, on up into Market Garden, Bastogne, and into Germany itself, Band of Brothers surpasses nearly all other ""human interest histories"" and becomes one of the most engrossing, captivating, emotionally-entangling tales that will ever be made. The history of this much-decorated company and its plethora of heroes needed to be told, and in being told deserved the best talents the filmmaking industry could offer: which it received. Band of Brothers is truly among the finest of television achievements and is sure to endure as a revered classic."	5.0	For Storytelling At Its Best Television Can Be A Finer Showcase Than Theater	2007-10-30	0	0	0

A powerful portrait of what it must be like to be thrust into such an overwhelming conflict, especially without knowing very much about your enemy. Gripping and, at times, incredibly gut-wrenching (see the episode where they finally discover a concentration camp). Every element put into each episode comes together beautifully.The idea to focus more on a different soldier each episode, while not letting the other characters fade into the background, was an innovative approach. Every actor shines in his role, bringing incredible depth to their portrayals. They make you cheer for every one of their triumphs, no matter how big or how small, and they make you feel for them when they're at their lowest. The fact that any one of the characters could die at any moment almost makes you want to not get very involved with any of their stories, but the actors put so much into each character that you just can't help feeling for them.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AA3YIVIT9Y1Q8	"Dan ""danc19732"""	I just pulled this set out and watched it all again cause it had been awhile since i saw it.Forget Saving Private Ryan,forget all other war movies for that matter,no 2 hour movie can capture the true feeling of what it must have been like to be there like this mini series does.I am not even really a war movie fan or anything probably mostly because of failed attempts by many movies to really drive home the point of how it must have been to actually be there and experience what the soldiers went through in WW 2.Band of Brothers is special because many things right down to the dialouge is used by actual accounts of the veterans who were actually there.The actors were great at bringing it all to life,they made you feel for them and at times make you believe they were the actual soldiers there rather then just guys protraying them.The way they shot the film really fits the mood and the era that the actual war took place.Its not black and white or anything like that but you'll have to see for yourself to understand what i mean.If you have a surround sound system  it really enhances the experience as it feels like the war is happening right in your living room.The great sound doesn't just end with the sound of artillery,even just the music they use during opening of each episode,everything just somehow fits perfect like a puzzle.Normally i wouldn't spend no 80 bucks on some DVDs even for like a whole season of a favorite show,but i have no regrets buying this set at all.Its probably not just my favorite war mini series but probably my favorite movie/mini series ever.Im sure i'll watch it all again numerous times,it never gets old for me.	5.0	still extraordinary the second time around	2005-07-01	4	3	1

I have seen them all, Longest Day, Saving Private Ryan, etc. etc. This is the best period.  It is like taking Saving Private Ryan, the Longest Day, A Bridge Too Far and a couple other classics then combine them in one new movie that is like 10 plus hours long not including the special features.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A60D5HQFOTSOM	"Daniel Cooper ""dancoopermedia"""	If only HBO had given Spielberg and Hanks the sort of budget available on complementary films like Patton and Saving Private Ryan. Nevertheless, other than the episode directed by Hanks the production is first class and the acting by many now-well known faces excellent. In the early episodes there are some unfortunate script touches that smack of Spielberg's heavy hand - his typical cartoonish characters - but they're dispensed with by halfway through. This is, of course, the story of the one of the companies of men who saved the world from the Nazis. It's a bloody horror.Watching it, I wished just such a series could be made about Vietnam, a needless, stupid war that cost 55,000 American lives and that America lost. In fact, I wonder what Easy Company of the 101st Airborne did in Vietnam. We should know, and perhaps Hanks and Spielberg will tell us.	4.0	A fine production, with minor problems	2014-06-16	0	0	0

This is quite possibly the best looking feature you can find on Blu-Ray. It brings to life all the beautifully crafted cinematography while still maintaining its classic, grainy feel of the time.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	ADVX0P3EIKWBK	Darth Wader	"Based on Stephen Ambrose's best-selling book, Band Of Brothers the DVD is a visual masterpiece, shocking at times and sweet at others.  The acting in this series is top-notch with great performances by: Damian Lewis (Why is this guy not in more movies/TV shows?!), Donnie Wahlberg (Marky Mark's bro), Ron Livingston (From Office Space!), David Schwimmer (Ross!), Frank John Hughes (Very Funny as SSgt. William 'Wild Bill' Guarnere), and a small appearance by Colin Hanks (Tom Hanks' son).  Everyone in Band Of Brothers is believable and when it shows the documentaries of the real people that the actors are portraying, it gives it that much more impact and authenticity.  There are ten episodes of Band of Brothers (see the review above by K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid"" for more detail).  Watching Band of Brothers showed me why they were the greatest generation with all the hardships that they endured and we could all learn from them.  My only problem with this near flawless DVD was that was an awful lot of swearing.  I guess that was accurate, but it made me feel differently about the soldiers and what their values were.  All in all, this is a must see and when you get the concentration camp disc, you will see, along with the soldiers, why the war was more than worth fighting."	5.0	Band Of Brothers - A Visual Masterpiece	2006-06-30	3	2	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AC7GCOLE8C576	Dave	This is based on the six DVD box set.I won't reiterate what's already been written--it is well-done, a superb television drama.I will say that it had a greater impact on me than &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; since BoB was based on the book by the same name, a factual recounting of the men of E Company, 101 Airborne.  These men were not characters from someone's imagination, but real people.  What was terrific was the way the telewriters handled the veteran's interviews.  While each episode begins with comments from veterans, not until episode 10 are the veterans identified.  This added to the impact of the miniseries.  I thought they were just men who happened to serve in the 101st at the time, or were in the general area of the battles.  Turned out that they were the actual men portrayed.  I won't say who--you've got to watch BoB to find out.I saw the DVD before I read the book.  I initially thought the weakest written and portrayed man of E Company was David Schwimmer's CAPT Sobel.  Since the rest of the actors were all unknowns, I thought that having the actor from the popular TV show &quot;Friends&quot; was a way to generate buzz for the series, though in my opinion, distracting.  However, after reading the book, Schwimmer's rendition of CAPT Sobel was accurate, and actually slightly toned-down.  Plus, Schwimmer bears a close resemblance to the real CAPT Sobel (there's a picture in the book).  I'd say now he got the part based on merit.BTW, my girlfriend is Taiwanese, a history buff, but not well-read in Western history.  She loved the DVD, every episode held her interest--and she hates violent films.	5.0	Solid piece of docudrama	2002-12-03	46	42	4

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AEMZRE6QYVQBS	David A. Baer	Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have honored the Greatest Generation as it deserves with this superb based-on-a-true-story film version of Easy Company's long march through various kinds of warfare from D-Day through the fall of the Third Reich.Others have written extensively about its dramatic and cinemagraphic achievements. Let me add a word about its value as a lens on the phenomenon of leadership under profound stress. The men of Easy Company surprised themselves with what the had in them. This is one of the enduring lessons of battle.However, Easy Company was better than it would have been because it was led by a man of integrity, honesty, humility, self-abnegation, and truthfulness. He was not a man of many words and he occasionally led the charge because it would have been more awful to send someone else first.I often sell dvds after viewing them. However, this collection of HBO's ten Band of Brothers episodes will go to my children when I'm gone as a family treasure.	5.0	one of the best film treatments of war ever	2006-08-03	3	3	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3RHPC2MHBS7CJ	"David A. Flanagan ""Dave"""	Saving Private Ryan started a genre of WWII films whereby achieving total accuracy in both the human and military aspects of warfare was the underlying goal of the whole production.  The acting is superb; character development is very well done. Many have already raved about this series, and I could rave on about it too, it is just great, but the one area I want to expound on is the historical accuracy of this film series.  The accuracy of the battle scenes is truly fantastic, whereby the German tanks, light field howitzers and self-propelled guns are either real in some scenes but in most cases, replicated with exacting detail that would fool only the most observant WWII armor expert.  Let's face it, there are not many Tiger Is or JagdPanthers (tank destroyer) left in running condition if any at all, so it is left up to the creativity of those tasked with the production of these films to product a convincing facsimile.  In the case of the Tiger I heavy tanks, the same ones used in Private Ryan were used which were mock-ups on-top of a Russian T-34 chassis. Again, they really pulled it off, so much better than the desert-sand painted American Patton tanks serving under Field Marshall Erwin Rommel in the movie Patton (1970).  The uniforms, equipment, small arms, and sets are very accurate, and really do an effective job of transporting the viewer back to the 1944-1945 ETO.This is a great series, and a very nicely done DVD collection, too bad you can't give it 10 stars because I would...	5.0	A truly monumental achievement in film.	2002-11-14	5	4	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3N3CNQD0L3HX9	David A. Franklin	I guess its that my Dad was severely wounded in the Battle of Budge that has made me so interested in this series. I have watched it about 20 times so far, both the regular and blu-ray version. The main reason I bought the blu-ray is because it offers interactive comments by the surviving soldiers. I have spent the last 6 months reading all of the books by all of the Easy Company soldiers that had books. After reading so many.....I am still looking for more and have found a few besides the best sellers, you start to develop a real connection with the characters. I am reading the book by David Webster who was the feature of the story about the river raid to capture a German.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2Q5AJIY8QB5ZR	"David B. Lennon ""World's Slowest Reader"""	"My wife summarized my feelings about this DVD series the best about a week after we finished the last DVD.  She said, ""I wish I could keep watching more about them.  I feel like I know those guys, and now I miss them.""I thought, what a testament to(a) the power and impact that the ""characters"" had on us(b) the performances of the actors(c) the production team that put it all together.Everyone undoubtedly knows the remarkable story of how these men bonded in during such a pivotal part of recent history. Their story makes for a very dramatic tale.  However, HBO, Hanks and Spielberg expertly weave Ambrose's book into a riveting account that grips the viewer, even a week after they finished watching."	5.0	An amazing production of remarkable experiences	2009-01-16	0	0	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	"HBO has distinguished itself with some really remarkable mini-series, such as ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and this epic, moving history of Easy Company's participation in the European campaign of WWII.  Over the course of 10 episodes we learn quite a bit about the military experience due to the extraordinary attention to detail and the relationships between the soldiers.  The characters are revealed to us gradually and we have ample time to appreciate and begin to identify with them.  When one is injured or killed, we are affected as well and gain a small insight of what it must be like to lose a comrade in battle.Compliments to the excellent cast, writers, and directors.  They have presented the story of Easy Company with respect and dedication./"	5.0	Moving history lesson	2004-09-02	5	5	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2ZGDQC5I92W6Z	David Carson	"Some people unfortunately just don't understand that sometimes war is inevitable and, dare I say it, right. The message that you take away from Band of Brothers is that every single soldier would rather be somewhere else doing anything else, but that it is the duty of freedom-loving citizens to confront evil and sometimes that means making war against those that are evil. I would say that there's a painful but outstanding message for future generations in this movie: If you allow evil to fester (and that's what it did in Europe before America's involvement in that theatre) the consequences may indeed be greater than had it been put down sooner, when it would have been more easily achieved.It is very clear that the reviewer from LA actually didn't watch Band of Brothers but is rather a knee-jerk goofball pacifist that probably can't make it through the day because they're always contorted into not making ""moral judgments"" about others. In the real world there is right and wrong, good and evil and good people that overlook others doing evil deeds (the German people during WWII) and the sooner you figure that out the better we'll all be. War does solve things when there is complete and utter victory on one side. These people that say it never solved anything are ignorant of the facts.I liked that as the story unfolded that the soldiers were not ever held up as role models in that they were spotless in their personal lives and that they suffered from the same human flaws that we all do and how terrible the consequences of those shortcomings could be.Band of Brothers was an extraordinary piece of work by Spielberg and Hanks and I applaud them for the attention to detail that made it a special experience. I enjoyed the interviews with the men of Easy Company almost as much as the story that the producers laid out. These men are/were truly remarkable for what they did to save Europe from itself and to cement our close relationship with the UK. I know that I am grateful for the sacrifices they made and those who survived just think of it as doing their duty when America called on them. They were so selfless in the ways that matter."	5.0	Very Dangerous Message Not To Accept	2004-04-01	29	20	9
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2YWS379CRIKLT	David C.	For the most part, true to the Stephen Ambrose book of the same name, this series provided an amazingly realistic glimpse into the heroism, dedication, and discipline of all the men of Easy Company (of course, things loosened up a bit after victory was at hand) as they marched through France, Holland, Belgium, and Germany. It gave me a deep appreciation for all they went through and the sacrifices they made to help ensure victory for the Allies. To top it all off, I loved the musical scores.	5.0	Realistic & Moving Series	2013-07-20	1	1	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A26KI8DIOJXR2S	David Cole	&quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is hands down the finest thing I have ever seen on a television screen over a 50+ year period.Perhaps I was especially moved because I am an old paratrooper (but not WW II and not 101st Airborne Division) and could identify a little with the great men of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.  Such identification is necessarily limited for one must be in awe of those who endured such unimaginable hardship and suffering and who served so heroically for such an extended period.The segues from interviews of the actual, now aging, heroes to the most realistic battle scenes ever recorded was masterfully done.  The actors, all new faces to me, were flawless in their performances.  I laughed, I cursed, I cried, I was stirred by every episode, every scene of this incredible series.Easy Company citizen-warriors, I salute you and hope that you will never be forgotten, thanks to Spielberg and Hanks.	5.0	Five stars is insufficient	2003-03-21	3	3	0

I just want to convey to you the lasting effect this series will leave with you. It somehow exposes you to the utter horror that is war, yet left me with a longing to fight for our country. That is exactly what this series leaves you with: honor and horror. The DVD set is worth every penny of the price, the packaging is wonderful, the historical facts you have available to you on every disc are indispensable, and the entire viewing experience is satisfying like nothing else I have ever viewed on television. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg truly show their genius in turning such a tough (and true) subject matter into such an outstanding and astounding work of art.	5.0	Every person under 40 in America should see this series...	2003-03-19	2	2	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	ATD08M0VSNKSF	David Gardner	Hanks and Spielberg embraced Stephen Ambrose's book,Band of Brothers and is faithful in it's depiction in this epic mini-series. The series is detailed and accurate with more enhancements in direction, sounds, and a haunting musical score.A first time viewer is shown vets commenting on the occurences in each episode and the identity of these vets are not revealed until the last episode. What amazes viewers will be that the characters in the story are real, which draws them back to view the series again, more drawn to the numerous characters in it.The story of Easy Company from it's days at Toccoa through Normandy, Holland, Bastone, and in Germany is one of the most complete in scope of the European Theater in World War II.What makes this series powerful is not just the realism and attention to details but identification with the many characters in the story. Each episode takes the view of one of the characters.Perhaps the best episode in the set would have to be Bastone which follows medic, Eugene Roe admist the chaos and terror of Easy Company's holding the line at Bastone, earning the 101st's title of the battered bastards of Bastone.Each disc has information of the actors in each episode as well as information on the characters they portray. Also there are maps, chain of command,and a glossary.Separate from the main story that makes this set worth having is the interviews with the actual participants of Easy Company. The connection of these men to each other can clearly be seen in their emotion and sharing of their experiences. The viewer gains an appreciation of what these men went through and strengthens the bond for the characters depicted.Other features of the set includes a making of and a video diary, shamelessly promoting the series. Interesting, but somewhat self serving.Saving Private Ryan helped to bring the reality of war to movie goers. Fans will know that this is but one episode in the war in Europe. (The story is actually based on events within the 506 PIR).The fact that the History Channel will be airing these episodes shows the impact of the dipiction of World War II in Europe by the series.The series is gritty and it will bring forth a diverse variety of emotions for the viewer.Look for great perfomances of the actors, and an interesting flow of events seen from the view of the characters (different in each episode). The haunting score is non-traditional in the War Movie genre - it blends with the chaos and pathos.All of the elements of this series make it unique and time well spent as the viewer soon identifies themselves with Easy Company.What makes this a fantastic story is not only that identification with the varied characters in it, but the story draws them into the action, and the viewer will care about them. It is difficult to imagine another series or movie that will approach the quality and sweeping epic of The Band of Brothers.	5.0	Band Of Brothers an Experienc	2003-12-03	0	0	0

It was a perfect way to tell the story of Bastogne though one could tell it ten other ways and still not capture the full meaning of that piece of the war.  And the series as a whole can be described in the same way:  it doesn't tell the whole story but it does tell a crucial part of it and does that with great impact.  It's not sentimental but it does honor the sacrifice of those men and is a tribute to the importance of what they did for the world.	5.0	Some episodes are better than others but the best of them are small masterpieces.	2014-06-03	1	1	0

That's when I started watching the video series.  Wow, they did a great job following the story of these incredible and extraordinary men.  The book and video ought to be required reading/watching in every school in this country to try and teach what it means to be free in this country.

Too many people forget what these young men did for us and are all too willing to let go the freedoms they fought and died for.  If this true story doesn't make any grown man cry openly, then there's just something wrong with you.  I'd like to see more historicaly accurate series like this on Amazon.

This occurred on pristine new discs fresh out of the box (No fingerprints, scratches or smudges whatsoever).  It also occurred several times during a broadcast performance on a cable TV channel when I watched it.  I find this war film to be one of the top 10 WWII films that I have seen, despite the bugs in the media and the fact that I haven't truly seen the entire film.  It's ironic that the glitches happen in the same or nearly the same locations on both copies that I own.  Due to the relatively high price of this series, I am reluctant to purchase a third copy for fear of the same problem.  Given the one review of the Blu ray version that mentions similar image quality problems, I don't anticipate purchasing that either.

And when I DID see it, I was pretty much stunned at the level of detail they put in the effort.These DVDs cover the training, deployment, combat action, rest, and then the end of the war for the veterans of Easy Company, along with additional material on the making of the series and the guys themselves.With so little attention being paid to World War II in most American classrooms today, it is a shame that the whole series can't be shown and discussed, with the details about why certain thigns were done the way the were shown, what prompted some of these things to happen, etc.  This series is rich in detail, writing, and is a completely satisfying package.This effort again makes me truly awed as to what the demands of combat can be, and what it takes to remain a beacon of hope to others around the world.	5.0	A strong adaptation of the book by Ambrose	2003-01-24	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1HA8IVQZQXPWI	David Williams	"With the number of reviews of ""Band of Brothers"" standing at over nine hundred, and the average rating being five stars, there is really nothing I can add to what has already been said. But I will weigh in anyway and say ""Band of Brothers"" is by far the best WWII film I have ever seen. Produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the ten-part HBO miniseries follows the men of Easy Company, 101st Airborne, from boot-camp through D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge to the taking of Hitler's Eagle's Nest. Each episode has a different director and focus, but the series maintains an overarching storyline with a common theme and common characters. Hanks' and Speilberg's involvement with the project make comparisons to ""Saving Private Ryan"" inevitable; like many other reviewers, I think ""Band"" is an improvement over ""Private Ryan,"" as the longer format allows for greater character development, and ultimately offers a more realistic psychological portrayal of what these particular soldiers endured. The film is also notable because for many it will serve as an introduction to the work of Stephen Ambrose, whose book of the same title is the basis for the miniseries.I absolutely recommend the ""Band of Brothers"" DVD box set to anyone who is at all interested in WWII history, or to anyone who is simply interested in seeing a great film. All of the extra features, especially the documentary (which features interviews with the real life survivors of Easy Company), are excellent. The only oversight by the producers is the lack of English subtitles; beyond that, everything in this set is golden. Like so many other reviewers here, I believe ""Band of Brothers"" is destined to become a classic."	5.0	Easily the best WWII film I've seen	2006-12-18	3	2	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2G4MGVWR20OOI	D. Brown	Band of Brothers is the best pure war movie ever made. In terms of bringing combat to its viewers, Band of Brothers has little or no competition. The dirt, death and despair of real fighting are vividly portrayed in an aggressive but accurate manner. It covers the actions of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, from their beginnings at Camp Toccoa, through western Europe and finally to victory over the Nazi regime. Historical detail was a key interest in the making of this ten part series. Many first hand accounts were used to support the on-screen drama. Some complained that the section involving E Company's seizure of Hitler's Aldershorst was inaccurate. It is true that E Company was not the first allied unit to occupy the Eagle's Nest. But this small discrepancy is one of a very few that I found in the film. So overall I rate its accuracy highly. If you want an engrossing, heroic and epic story about the allied triumph in World War Two, then Band of Brothers is your film.	5.0	Become one of the...'Happy few.'	2003-07-02	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A30E2YL894IX7Y	D. Doppes	"With the passing of Dick Winters- I wanted to write about him and this great series here. This series has so many reviews here that I can't really add anything new to someone interested in buying this collection. But the 1,800+ reviews that have rated this a 5 star series is all you really need to know.Major Winters died on January the 2nd. His leadership, which is displayed greatly in this series should be inspirational to all. He led without arrogance or a sense of bravado. His calm demeanor instilled confidence in the men who surrounded him in times of battle. He was a humble man. His decision making was always with the best interests of his troopers in mind.After the war ended Mr.Winters lived on a farm in Fredericksburg and built his own home. He didn't talk about the war, until the years leading up to Mr.Ambrose's "" Band Of Brothers"". The men that served under him had tried to get him the Medal Of Honor- but their attempts were unsuccessful. Mr.Winters is probably happier with the thoughts of his men than any medal he could be awarded.I had the original dvd series for many years. And like many others here I upgraded to blu ray when it was available- its amazing on blu ray. I have a tradition every winter when my area is about to get its first big snow of watching the series again- the Bastogne scenes coupled with the snow and cold winter here seem to go together for me.I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys history. Even if you don't like war or this type of series- you will enjoy the top rate acting, production and story telling. All the while remember this is American history! This program is great for future generations to enjoy. Not to mention all the extra features- including interviews with Dick Winters and the men of Easy Company!"	5.0	RIP Major Dick Winters	2011-01-10	5	5	0

The writing, the acting, the cinematography, the production design - it all works. OK, it exaggerates the importance of Easy Company a tad - they didn't actually win the war themselves - but the depiction of the decline of soldiers at war is moving. American military officers from WWI hadn't experienced the ""battle fatigue"" or ""shell shock"" and so were incapable of recognizing its onset in front-line soldiers. To that extent, I suppose this would qualify as ""revisionist history"" similar to Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.Valuable for what it teaches about the price the soldier pays in war.

Some of the best vignettes for me include Easy Company passing a French lady and her baby on the road. The French woman's head has been shaved by her cowardly/heroic compatriots.  Shortly beofre that, an entire group of German prisoners are shot out of hand; one of them had been raised in the US before answering the call. American soldiers are also shown looting and a captured German general makes an excellent speech to his imprisoned band of brothers troops that the watching Americans can very much relate to. It is, in other words, a much truer version of events than the John Wayne/Audie Murphy gruel of old.The soldiers learn both good things and bad about love, life and all the rest as they move on towards Germany and Austria. Their learning processes are well captured. One last vignette is of an American officer shooting a surrendering German boy soldier in the heat of battle. Band of Brothers helps bring war down to its primeval level and that makes it worth 5 or more stars.	5.0	No Audie Murphy or John Wayne	2005-10-14	6	0	6

This is selective for a reason, it's a movie about the brotherhood of soldiers for Easy Company during WWII.  This is not a movie about other countries and their forces. Just like ""Blackhawk Down"" is a movie about U.S. special forces in Mogadishu.  This is a movie about a US unit, it will be from their perspective and memories.  So don't be trying to bash this movie, cause it is centered on US unit it's going to be about a US unit. It pisses me off when you Europeans bash our war movies.  They are our war movies about our US units, thus the movie would be from our soldiers perspectives. Just like ""IWO JIMA"" ""TORA TORA TORA"" or ""Battle of Britain"" don't make references to all the other WWII units involved.This isn't a movie about The German 1st SS Panzer ""Leibstandarte"", 5th SS ""Viking"", FJR 1/FJD, 1./LL STURM RGT, Fallschirm Pionier Batallion 1.  Neither is this movie about the Russian 49th Guards Rifle Division, 89th Guards Rifle Division, 8th Guards Mechanized Corps, 36th Motorized Rifle Division.  Nor is this about the British 3rd Para Brigade, 8th Army, the British 3rd Division, the 50th Division, the 6th Airborne Division King's Shropshire Light Infantry, the East Yorkshire, and Devonshire regiments.  These countries could make their own movie about what their forces did during WWII, I could care less.  They have a right to make a movie from their soldiers perspectives with them as a center piece, doesn't mean I'll bash it for not showing the US side of things.This movie was centered on one company, Easy Company part of 506th PIR ""Parachute Infantry Regiment"", which was part of the 101'st Airborne.  Other main units that were part of the Normandy airdrop were 3rd Battalion 502nd PIR, 506th PIR, and even the 82nd Airborne.  Then came Carentan, Market Garden, Battle of the Bulge, and the Siege of Bastogne.  There were other units involved in all those fights, but this movie wasn't about the other units.  Remeber this isn't about all the other WWII units, this isn't a documentary, its the story soldiers experiences from mainly one company during WWII.And oh by the way, my dad is a US Vietnam Vet."	5.0	"this is for ""German Cold War Infantry Officer """	2003-05-25	7	5	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	ALCTVUGB5WZG1	Dennis J. Buckley	"The daunting task of providing a comprehensive review of this outstanding series has been tackled by others. In its accuracy, attention to detail, respect for the truth, and in its touching humanity, ""Band of Brothers,"" is THE pre-eminent small unit account of the great Crusade in Europe.In addition to its excellent acting, narration and production, ""Band of Brothers,"" is an historical work rather than a work of fiction and entertainment like too many ""war movies,"" from the last ten years.This series is vitally important. It is, as far as any history can be, a considered, retrospective chronicle of past times, and we collectively, as a nation, need to remember those times.This is not fiction. As was written on a photo taken of another incident from that war, ""This really happened!"" We need to remember that.It is ironic, though not unexpected, that the sacrifices of the men like those of Easy Company are only now being appreciated as those men reach the end of life. But that appreciation, however belated, is vital to the affirmation of our national character and national resolve in these trying times.Americans do not go to war lightly. In every conflict, we need to understand, ""Why We Fight."" I can only hope that current and future generations of our children will watch this important work."	5.0	These Men Saved Our World	2004-11-03	12	7	5

I consider it one of the best looks at those who took part in combat in WWII, and looked forward to getting the DVD set for my collection.But (and I consider this to be a big but) when I popped in the the DVD and went to set up the subtitles, there was no option for English subtitiles (I could have changed to Spanish subtitles if I was fluent in Spanish.  But I digress)! No problem, I thought, I'll just switch to Closed Captioning on my TV; after all, when I saw it on TV it was Closed Captioned.  Imagine my shock and surprise when the Closed Captioning that was included in the broadcast version was missing from the DVD.  Ironically, as I finished watching an episode on the DVD, there was another episode airing on the History Channel - with the Close Captioning!While Closed Captioning is a luxury for me - I can hear well enough, but enjoy the Closed Captioning to catch nuances in the dialog - I can't help but think that this would be a big deal for older viewers - say, those who actually lived through the war.I give this DVD 3 stars - not for the content, which is superb, but for the lack of foresight that saw the release of this DVD with neither English subtitles or Closed Captioning - which had already been done for the broadcast!	3.0	Eh?

I later found out from Amazon that there was apparently a problem with this set.  I even ordered a replacement set...but it didn't work either...so I returned it for a refund.  Not sure what the problem is or why...but I'm reluctant to try to order again.  Amazon had it &#34;off&#34; the buy list for awhile...maybe the problem is solved now.  As a note, It WOULD play on my computer, but not on my Blue-ray, 3-D, very new DVD player...no explanation for that difference.

One can identify with the emotions that the characters undergo.The casting of relatively unknown faces was a novel idea, as one does not relate the actors to any of their previous works. The DVD quality is great and loaded with information, as well as interviews and behind the scenes footage.I would recommend Band of Brothers to all history buffs.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1ENC0ALMHVBU	"D. HupFons ""Hup234"""	"As a long-time war movie fan, I give this set the highest rating. BAND OF BROTHERS is so well done that it will set the standard for other war movies for years to come. This 6-disk set has excellent audio & video, a top knotch ensemble cast, world class co-producers (Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks who also collaborated on SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), and a exceptional soundtrack.The story is based on Stephen Ambrose's best selling book by the same title.  The acting and the script give the best portrayal I've seen of the close ties that develop among combat troops during wartime. The last ""chapter"" of the set, WE STAND ALONE TOGETHER, is a must see documentary in and of itself.  It shows survivors of the combat unit (Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division) reflecting on their actual experiences that the DVD set portrays.  It's dramatic, funny, poignant, and insightful.  I LOVE the ending.To maximize your enjoyment of this set, I recommend that you (1) watch it on a large screen high definition TV with a surround sound system, (2) read Ambrose's book, and (3) buy the soundtrack and listen to it often."	5.0	The Best War Series Made	2006-01-14	0	0	0

I don't have over $100 to spend on this box set.  But I wish I did.  This is probably the best war movie I have ever seen.  It follows Easy Company, probably the most famous platoon of world war 2 from their training in boot camp, to the very end at hitler's ""Eagle Nest.""  They were a platoon that suffered 150% casulties.With the exception of its length (over ten hours) this is right up their with  a big bedget movie.  It has great actors, awesome cinemetogrophy, and great war special effect.  Don't let the fact that this tv miniseries is a wimpy piece of junk.  It's not!  Because it was on HBO, the makers made sure to keep it realistic with the violence (lots of blood, injures, lossed limbs, etc...), theirs bad language and even a little nudity.  So don't let a little kid watch this.  The late Michael Kamen provides the excellent score and really provides a ambient backdrop to the sorrow and loss and horrible side of war.If you are at all interesting in Worl War II or like war movies in general.

This is a great transfer. The producers definitely took care when authoring this version. That said, because of the stylistic nature of the way it was shot, if you are someone who can't really tell the difference between DVD and Blu-ray - and you already own this on DVD - you probably shouldn't bother. But, if like me, the differences are like night and day, get this set. You absolutely will not regret it.	5.0	An Amazing Mini-Series Made Even Better on Blu-ray	2009-02-08	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2ULCEP7IVUWV0	D. Martin	"I bought this DVD set for my husband for his birthday because he had heard such great reviews about it and really wanted to see it.  Being veterans ourselves (he served 6 years; I did 20), I was interested in seeing the series as well, but sadly, not as much as my husband was.  I have always enjoyed war movies, but at times I have had to give myself a rest from them because I get very emotional when viewing them.Once I finally sat down and started watching this, I was hooked.  It was hard for me to turn off the TV because I always wanted to know what was going to happen next.  Now that I have watched the series, I will most likely read the book then watch the series again.Because I am a military retiree, ALL veterans are very special to me, as they should be to all fellow military members, regardless of their status, and I am thankful every single day of the sacrifices these men and women made for me and all others living in the U.S., citizens and otherwise.  It is because of these sacrifices that I had the freedom to join the military and serve my country for 20 years.  It is because of these sacrifices that foreigners are able to live and work in a free country.I was told a story of a senior female Army officer who complained about having to shake the ""old, wrinkled hands"" of our veterans on Veteran's Day.  How dare her!  How dare her cast such unspeakable shame on the Army uniform, her fellow service members, and on our veterans!  Had I heard this, I would have chewed her up one side and down the other.  As far as I am concerned, she should have been down on her hands and knees and kissing the feet of our veteran's for what they did for us.Obviously, this woman has not seen this series; perhaps if she did, she could understand the unbelievable sacrifices these young men and their families made for us.  Unfortunately, because she is so self-serving, she never will."	5.0	Moving and awe-inspiring!  Keep the tissues close by!!	2006-08-25	4	2	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2KH46L7QIC2Z8	D Mojica	Even if you have the DVD set...get the Blu Ray version.  The DVD extras are cool but the Blu Ray extras take it to a whole new level.  While playing the episodes you can either have video commentary from Easy Company which really adds to the scenes (great if you have seen the episodes multiple times...) -or- you can have a field guide timeline that displays facts at certain points...really informative and awesome supplement to the episodes.  I have seen the series several times so the new features really add to the experience, they also fill in gaps that make certain scenes make complete sense.Great gift - I recieved the DVD set for Christmas in 2003 and was my cherished present for years.  Got the Blu Ray set for Christmas 2008 and renewed that feeling!Really, I don't think a series has come out since Band of Brothers that has captured my attention like this has.  I watched all 10 episodes over the course of a week with my Grandpa who is a WWII vet...he couldn't wait for me to get home so we could watch another episode.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A18ZTDEFI0TDS7	Dominick Greci	"This is by far the best war movie/miniseries that has ever been made on this period of WWII. While Tom Hanks ""saving Ryan's privates"" was a good movie, this has something that that one lacked, a true story. This was not made up, color coated or told to fit someone's story, and this was the way it happened. And in response to that girl from Sweden who would not know a good movie if it fell out of the sky and hit her, this one did tell the truth. And to make one correction, the Americans did lose several battles in this movie, and the German tanks also did take out some of those shermans as well. and the Germans did plenty of killing our own soldiers after they became prisoners, so get your facts straight, and rewatch the movie and write a better review. I would highly recommend this to any one who wants a better idea of what our soldiers went through."	5.0	The Best one yet, PERIOD!!!	2003-02-24	1	0	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1KB06V9UG5TIR	Dorothea Brook	This addictive mini-series, produced by Tom Hanks' production company, has a ferocious beauty about it. It is so well-cast and convincingly photographed that you'll forget you're watching a movie from the safety of your comfy chair. You're IN this experience and it is not for the faint-hearted. Band of Brothers centers on the guys of &#34;Easy&#34; (E) Company, an eclectic mix of guys for whom nothing comes easy--from their landing on the bloody beaches of Normandy through the freezing forests of Germany and to the horrifying discoveries of the death camps, the rubble that was once Berlin, and finally to the summit of Hitler's abandoned Eagle's Nest. B of B is probably as authentic a recreation of the WWII European campaign as is cinematically possible. Yet, we know the real thing was far, far worse. This is not just superb entertainment; it is a necessary reminder of history's most important lesson: freedom is not free and it's not guaranteed. To fail to learn from history or be ignorant of it, as we seem to have done in this country, is to invite its worst lessons over and over.	5.0	Simply Magnificent	2014-06-18	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A37GRFP6VMUXKT	"Douglas S. Wood ""Vicarious Life"""	Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division is by now the most widely recognized WWII unit, thanks to the efforts of Stephen Ambrose and now this fabulous HBO series directed by Tom Hanks and David Frankel. The series follows Easy's story from training camp, through D-Day and beyond, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and the Eagle's Nest. The old cliche that if it wasn't true, nobody would believe it really applies to their exploits.Damian Lewis shines as Dick Winters, the leader of Easy, as does Frank John Hughes playing Sgt. William 'Wild Bill' Guarnere, Dexter Fletcher as Sgt. John Martin, and Eion Bailey as Pvt. David Kenyon Webster.Each segment begins with the actual veterans speaking about their wartime experiences. 'Band of Brothers' is a DVD set worth owning - you'll want to watch it again and again.There are a number of books out covering Easy Company including the original Band of Brothers book by Ambrose. Winters has written a memoir. Another 101st Airborne author is Donald Burgett whose 'Currahee!: A Screaming Eagle at Normandy' and three other memoirs are far from the sanitized version of warfare presented by Ambrose. David Kenyon Webster's 'Parachute Infantry: An American Paratrooper's Memoir of D-Day and the Fall of the Third Reich' is an especially interesting memoir that was written by the Harvard garduate in the 1950's, well before the widespread interest in Easy Company.Highest recommendation for anyone interested in WWII.	5.0	A DVD Set Worth Buying	2006-12-18	4	3	1

It highlights, the Bad/Madness of War, and the bonds of friendship forged in a time in hell.  There is nothing sane about war and it is NOT sanitized.  And it illustrates very well, near the end that the holocaust indeed happened.  Eyewitnesses.While we are always embracing the doom of never learning from the past, this Movie, brings a new level of awareness of personal sacrifice, friendship, and that War Vets are NOT the psychos hollywood usually portrays soldiers as.

It captured not only the Germans at the end, but also captured a very realistic view of military life - from training for battle, dealing with those intent on climbing the military ladder concerned only with themselves, good leaders, good soldiers, some not-so-good soldiers, fear, bravery, the brutality of war, how to accomplish the almost impossible with so little, helplessness, cold, patience, and the list could go on and on. Above all, the movie really captured how a group of soldiers from so many different backgrounds could band together in the ultimate struggle for survival - each dealing with the horrors and losses of war in his own way. Just like real brothers, they didn't always get along so great, but were there for each other when it really counted. A tribute to true American heroes. Should make us all thankful we still speak English and are free.	5.0	Band of Brothers - Excellent War Series	2014-06-23	0	0	0

That is one of the all-time best features of DVDs, being able to turn down the volume on the LOUD combat and aircraft scenes without missing any of the dialog.  With small children in the house, we rarely watch adult content films like this one without the captioning to keep the noise level at a minimum while they sleep.Other than this one complaint, the series has well earned a full 5 stars.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A72UVJBUN2FK2	"D. Spiller ""davespil"""	I have watched this whole 10 hour seris twice, and I am 2 hours into watching it a third time. It's that good. Matter fact, if I were to classify this as a movie, it would be, by far, the best movie I have ever seen. This series is 10 episodes, roughly and hour each, telling the TRUE story of the soldiers of Easy Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airbourne. From paratrooper training with a useless commanding officer, a D-Day jump out of aircraft that were literally being blown out of the sky, fighting through France, Belguim and Holland, freezing but holding off constant German attacks at Bastogne, and being the first to get to Hitler's Eagle Nest, these men went through hell, together. It is an unflinching look at WWII through the eyes of several of the men in the company. Produced by Steven Speilberg and Tom Hanks, it has the Saving Private Ryan Feel and covers the story of Private Ryan's (Matt Damon) unit. But make no mistake, this is 10 hours of the greatest cinema I have ever seen. You will follow several main charecters throught the war, some episode will be told through the eyes of a specific charecter. Others will be in third person, but there is not a single episode which I do not like. The acting is amazing, all the way around. The production is top notch, the special effects, camers and sound effects are flawless, this series is a masterpiece. It also has 80 minutes of interviews by the actual people how performed these heroic deeds. Look at all the other reviews and you will find that no one has a bad thing to say.	5.0	Simply The Best	2004-01-14	1	1	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2TXR85WQLE32N	D. S. Thurlow	"2001's ""Band of Brothers"" is Tom Hanks' and Steven Spielberg's absolutely superb dramatization of Stephen Ambrose's account of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.  Originally aired on HBO as a mini-series, and later on the History Channel, the DVD collection includes all ten episodes plus some extra features on the making of the series.Each episode captures a piece of the story of Easy Company in the Second World War: The stand-up of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment in Toccoa, Georgia; the two brutal years of tough training that bonded the men together; the D-Day airborne drop into France and the fight for the Normandy beachhead; the drop into Holland as part of Operation Market-Garden; the desperate defense of Bastogne at Christmas 1944; the fight into Germany in 1945; and occupation duty in Austria at the end of the war.The series clears shows its extraordinary production values and dedication to authenticity.  The producers wisely chose a collection of relatively unknown actors; at the time of production, only ""Friends"" alumni David Schwimmer was well-known. The cast are allowed to inhabit their characters over the course of the series.  Damon Lewis and Ron Livingston are perfect as the two young officers at the center of the narrative. Lewis portrays Dick Winters, arguably the hero of Ambrose's original narrative and one of the featured speakers in the commentary by the real veterans of Easy Company, sprinkled throughout the episodes.Each episode is a complete story by itself, typically centering on one or more members of Easy Company.  The look at war is tough, realistic, unflinching, capturing the tough choices and tough deals that war hands out, yet ultimately sympathetic to the young men who made up Easy Company.  A brief retrospective at the end captures some of the fates of the Easy Company soldiers and reinforces the point of the series.  These were ordinary Americans who came together to form a nearly unbreakable unit through three years of war; the survivors went on with their lives afterward, but were forever changed by their experience together.""Band of Brothers"" is most highly recommended as a superb, even unmatched viewing experience and as a valid piece of history in its own right.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A20EHAR40RISAX	"D. Stone ""Stoneman"""	"I have to say that this series blew me away. I was so impressed with the effort put into Saving Private Ryan to give it a documentary look and feel. Band Of Brothers falls from the same tree. Once again, Hanks and Spielberg reunite to produce this epic cable series of WW2 as told by the men themselves. Every episode has interviews from the soldiers who were there. Very realistic and emotional stuff.First off, the set comes in a metal box with fold out style disk holders. Exactly like the standard dvd edtion a few years ago.The Blu-Ray edition has 6 disks total. 2 episodes per disk on the first 5 with many, many extras on number 6.The quality of the picture is perfect. These films were shot with tons of natural grain for that documentary style look. The lenses also give the look of a 40's camera used in the field. Although the film itself is washed out and very rough, it has awesome detail. You will notice so many things going on in the background. The size of the shots sometimes leave you in awe. The blacks are sometimes unstable, but that is the intent. The daytime scenes are beautiful in their full scope. The greatest thing about this series is the uncompromising attention to detail. From the uniforms to the weapons. The skintones are spot on and very nice looking with great detail. The majority of these episodes were shot outdoors. So, the landscapes look fantastic! From the coast of France, to the mountains of Austria, this has some amazing and beautiful scenery. While the picture may be "" washed out "", it looks and feels just as you would expect from the point of view from a combat photographer. The battle scenes are simply unbelievable. It takes you to a new level realism.The sound is second to none. You will easily be blown away with the audio track quality. You have to turn down the volume at many points during battle scenes. The voices are crisp and clean, but the battle scenes really rock your sound system. All of your speakers get a good workout. The subwoofer really hammers out the explosions. The rear speakers have tons of gunfire from all directions, as do the side speakers. You will have a true surround sound experience. Many movies do not make full use of the full audio possibilities. This one does!There are great extras here as well. Great in depth interviews from the soldiers themselves. A really cool making of documentary called "" We stand together: The men of easy company "" And many other things for the history buff. Cant say enough about this product. If you are a war genre lover, this is one of the best. If you love history, and dont want a watered down, made for Hollywood war film. This is how it happened as told by the men of the 506th E Co. You will have a new respect for these guys who gave so much. It is hard to believe that some people could give so much for so little. Thank god they did."	5.0	Probably one of the best war films ever made. Stunning on Blu-Ray.	2008-11-17	225	213	12

Most of the filming is grainy but there are more clear shots (that look priceless on Blu-Ray) than you realize.My only complaint is the DVD's are kind of tricky to get out of the insert.As far as the story goes, I wish they would have followed the book more closely. There are a few discrepancies. I also wish they would have mentioned how Sobel blotched his own suicide later in his life and then finally finished him self off.NOTE>> I have a Samsung BD-P 1500 blu-ray player.

He expressed awe over the amazing events these soldiers experienced and the sharp clarity with which these elderly men still expressed events all these years later. My younger son of 16 asked for the Band of Brothers DVD Set based on his brother's reaction, my young son's military interest, and the telecast of the series (on TV).My teenage son was quite satisfied receiving this on Christmas morning. It so happened my soldier son was home for Christmas Break and in the following week the two could be found absorbed intently on the realism of this amazing drama. I would hear them in between episodes talking about specific details. It was conversation about the characters, the actors, the weapons, uniforms, combat strategies, etc. It was a remarkable history lesson and an entertaining drama for them to share.I have yet to sit down and watch this series, hence my 4 stars instead of 5.	4.0	A Moving History Drama for My Sons	2007-01-18	6	2	4

I have watched this series and it really fills in the blanks about what my grandfather went through during that war. I have heard quite a few stories from him, through the years. What I saw in the series echos his accounts. He has no interest in watching the series, however, due to the fear of it bringing back too many memories of that time. One story he told me is that of guarding the German officers tent of Field Marshal Kessellring and others during their surrender. As Kessellring and the other officers were allowed to keep their sidearms, when under American capture, Kessellring handed my grandfather his Luger as he exited the officer's tent after formally surrendering. I am buying this series for my 16 year old nephew for Christmas, as he requested.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1SO8AE23KZ0HZ	"Echo ""Echo"""	This is one of the most harrowing pieces of drama to grace the screen.  The portrayal of the airborne infantry during World War II is stark, unsentimental, and at times very unpleasant.  We're glad for such a detailed portrayal over the course of the US' involvement in World War II, and for the dramatization of details that would otherwise be lost to history.  In the end, no one in their right mind would think the European theater was anything but horrific for these infantrymen.We see in the first episode that the men of Easy Company are human - fallible, ordinary, and in some cases mediocre.  At the final episode, we see that the strengths and weaknesses of each member of Easy Company contribute to the unit's combat success. The names for the most part are real.  The cliches are out the window - some of the men were strong, a few were weak, but all were heroes.  I don't know if I needed to know the name of the first failed company commander, or the name of a unit member who committed a petty crime...but in the end all of these men contributed to the astonishing combat success of Easy Company, whether they intended to or not.It's shocking to see how young the actors are...didn't we just see some of them in a music video?  However,  in many cases, the men they portrayed were even younger.  In the D-Day episode, we are treated to a near non-stop barrage of sound effects - anti-aircraft, artillery, and naval gunfire.  It continues for nearly an hour, and doesn't stop for breath.  Later episodes are just as illustrative...you feel hot and exposed during the Market Garden segment, cold during the Bastogne segment, and by the time Easy Company reaches Berchtesgaden you're anxious for the men to come home.As the series progresses we see the human tragedy of the wasted lives, death, and the folly of fascist dictators.  We're glad that someone stood up to the Axis, at such a huge cost.  This series should be required viewing for young adults and for civilian leaders in a democracy.	5.0	An astonishing achievement...	2003-11-11	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A9L6L5H9BPEBO	Edwin C. Pauzer	"This superbly acted and directed DVD centers around the troopers of Company E (Easy), of the 506th (5 Oh 6th) Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), 101st Airborne Division (Screaming Eagles) from their training in Camp Toccoa and Curahee Mountain in Georgia through part of the occupation of Germany after victory in Europe.Their story begins with interviews of the now older men who recount how they volunteered for the airborne (paratroops). Thoughtfully, the director did not include the questions from the interviewer, only the accounts of the veterans. These accounts precede and conclude most episodes.The men, like the title of the song of the Screaming Eagles, have a ""Rendevous with Destiny"" engaging in some of the most important campaigns of World War II. They were dropped in Normandy just prior to D-Day, Holland in Operation Market-Garden, defended Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, liberated a concentration camp, were the first to occupy Hitler's lair in Berchtesgarden, and occupied some of the most beautiful country (I have ever seen) in Salzburg, Austria.This is a story about men, not war. It is a story about civilians who became the army's elite--paratroopers, and developed a brotherhood from the nightmare of their shared experiences, and the losses of their fellow troopers. The non-commissioned officers held their company together inspired by officers with outstanding leadership skills, or in spite of officers with dismal ones.The story concludes with answers to the question of whatever happened to the men. We learn of how they reentered civilian life, and when some of them died. We see the older veterans attending their reunions and their grown children telling the camera how they never knew what their fathers went through because they didn't talk about it. Fittingly, the story ends with former Major Winters who was one of the commanders of Easy Co. telling us that his grandson asked him if he was a hero in the war. ""No,"" he replied, ""but I served in a company of heroes.""Spoken like a true leader.Don't pass this one by. This is a story about our fathers and grandfathers.

The encounter with the Nazi prison camps was very real.  My uncle was one of the first paratroopers to enter one of the Polish prison camps because he was fluent in Polish.  His reception was very similar to that displayed in Band of Brothers.  My uncle was hugged by these men even though they were covered with maggots, etc.  They were so grateful to be freed.  Again, this series displayed the reality of those death camps.  These were not a hoax as some might think.  They were real!

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3PLZRR0IVN0F4	"E. Lim ""Wait and See"""	Truly an epic mini-series. When people say epic, it's generally semi-epic or hardly worthy of your full attention. But this movie, it grabs your attention. There is no escaping the passion, the fears and the courage that this movie emits through the brave tellings of the men of Easy Company. Men that are like our fathers, brothers, uncles, cousins and nephews. Men that have rose to the call of duty and have did some of the most heroic and extrodinary things in our time. Though watching this movie can only give a person a glimpse of what it was like on D-Day and the hell of trying to survive a war, it gives you the best glimpse possible.This mini-series will go down in history as an amazing cinematic epic that will forever shake and rock the roots of war movie making. No movie, tv show or mini-series will ever rise above the amazing story and skill that created 'Band of Brothers'.	5.0	Band of Brothers	2005-04-13	9	9	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A4FAPQKQQLJY1	Elite	Band Of Brothers follows the path of Easy Company (of the 101st Airborne Division) during WWII. When I had first heard of this mini-series being made, I was excited by the prospect of Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks teaming up. Obviously their other WWII collaberation (Saving Private Ryan) was a success. Right away I knew this was going to be good. I just didn't realize it was going to be THIS good. This is easily the best mini-series I have ever seen. The production qualities pass some major motion pictures being made these days. Each episode is around an hour long (some running a bit longer), even though they all could have been two hours and I wouldn't have complained.Like I said, this is the true story of Easy Company. Easy Company fought in many of the major battles during WWII. Boot Camp, D-Day, Battle Of The Bulge, Holland, finding a concentration camp & even capturing Hitler's 'Eagle's Nest' is chronicled here. What I think I like best about this series, besides the production values & aboslute class everything in the series is done in, is that not every episode is just about some battle the company went through. The characters are well developed, so when they die you will actually care. And the little touches put into the series is amazing.Even though the cast if filled with mostly (at the time) no-name actors, the acting is outstanding. I especially liked Damian Lewis in the role of Lt. Richard Winters. Ever since I saw this series back in 2001, I have wanted to see him in some movies. Ron Livingston plays Easy's intelligent officer, and one of the other 'central' characters here. Donnie Wahlberg, Matthew Settle, Neal McDonough, David Schwimmer, Scott Grimes, and even Tom Hank's son Colin play important roles in this tale. I can't remember the names of all of the other actors in the series, but they are great overall. Even Dale Dye is great here. Of course, what's a war movie without Dale Dye in in though?On top of the great acting and story, this is one great looking series. Some of the shots just make your jaw drop. I also love how it is shot in a washed out look. Only toward the end of the series when Easy captures the Eagle's Nest, does the series have a colorful and bright look to it. I must also commend Michael Kaman for his beautiful opening score. The rest of the music during the series is also top notch.It's hard to put into words how good everything is done in this series. By the time you are finished watching the opening credits of the first episode, you will know you are watching something special. I love how they put short comments from some of the original members of Easy Company at the beginning of some of the episodes. Some are very emotional and almost bring you to tears.One episode that stood out to me in particular that could have been a movie in it's own right was part seven. This is the best hour of television I have ever seen in my life. It's a visual sight to behold and will get you emotionally more than you would expect. The same could be said for part nine, which has Easy Company finding a concentration camp. I felt really disturbed after watching that one and it really shows how evil war can be.If you are fan of war movies in any way, you owe it to yourself to go pick this up. If you are a fan of good cinema or TV, you owe it to yourself to go pick this up. This is not only the most amazing mini-series ever created, it's a true story of a group of men that were thrown together in a horrible war and ended up becoming heroes.Special Features: There is an 80 min. documentary on Easy Company's path through the war as told by some of the living members. It's very interesting and pulls at your heart strings at times. Very well done. Then there is a 30 min. 'making of' documentary by HBO. This isn't near as good as the first documentary, but it's a decent watch. You also get Ron Livingston's video diaries, which show what it was like to go through Dale Dye's actor boot camp. This lightens up the mood quite a bit and is interesting, as well as humorous.Before each episode you can access a 'Field Guide' to the series. This basically explains the ranks, who's each character, where the story is, etc. This would be helpful if you skipped episodes and wanted to pick the story back up quickly or are confused about which character is which. I didn't find much use for this, but it is great to have it nonetheless. Overall I liked the special features quite a bit and didn't feel shorted whatsoever. If I could give this DVD set ten stars, I would. Go get it already!!!	5.0	The best mini-series ever made	2006-08-11	6	6	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AROZYKSJBA2I4	E. Martinez	"By now, most people have heard of the mini-series Band Of Brothers. Unfortunally I neglected this show when it was originally aired in 2001 because of 9/11 and its aftermath. When I received this order from Amazon, I honestly did not know what to expect. After watching all 10 episodes, the praise this show received was well deserved. After watching the mini-series, I began to think, ""can the same type of comraderie survive in this age?"" I would like to hope so. On a related note, in 2004, when I was a junior in high school, I attended Boy's State which is a subordinate org. of the American Legion, a veteran's organization. There, WWII vets told me stories about best friends from childhood dying in front of them, and of acts of heroism that could not be made up by even the best hollywood screenwriter. But they put up with it for the man next to him, and in the belief that what they were doing was just. After taking into consideration of veterans as well as the portrayal of soldiers in WWII, this review can best be summed up by the words than are on the tin box: They Depended On Each Other And The World Depended On Them."	5.0	One of the best portrayals of war in some time	2006-07-25	5	3	2

Watching the series unfold was true excitement - not a single plot-line seems unneccessary or stupid, all the performances were incredible, and the action sequences were dead-on. The story is an incredible retelling of what life was like for the paratroopers.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3L2U581LL17EB	Eric	Band of Brothers will probably play as a curiosity piece for those who've heard a lot about it, but know next to nothing of the miniseries' story or ambitions. Some might just dismiss it as another in a long line of war films, which would be too bad. Band of Brothers is among the best war films I've ever seen, and don't let the made-for-TV label dissuade you. This may be a miniseries, but few films have achieved the epic scale and attention to detail this work creates.The miniseries' focus is on Easy Company, elite paratroopers fresh out of training and ready to make their drop over Normandy pre-D-Day. They're led by Lt. Richard Winters, a young, but intelligent, clear-headed officer who proves effective in the heat of combat. The film concentrates on Easy Company's journeys and battles through war-torn Europe, as well as the men themselves, and the growing effect war inflicts upon each of them.As Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks' second collaboration, Band of Brothers is a monumental achievement that approaches Saving Private Ryan in its ability to place you in the heat of combat. This miniseries isn't quite as successful with character development, mainly because the huge cast makes it hard to tell some people apart, especially when their faces are covered with dirt and grime, a consistent sight you'll get used to here.But the attention to so many details (including the characters) is what makes Band of Brothers a triumph. Most notable is a scene not long after the parachute drop, when one of the members of Easy Company encounters a German prisoner, who's actually from America, but fights on the opposite side because of his ethnic background. There's even a fairly in-depth description and meaning behind a flower that a dead German soldier has pinned to his buttonhole, a historical detail I was never familiar with (see, TV does teach you stuff).Most of the series is concerned with the camraderie among the members of Easy Company. And despite a cast of relatively unknown actors, there's not a weak performance throughout. As Richard Winters, Damien Lewis excels, displaying the admirable qualities that made this man so respected and beloved among his men. It's a superb performance, and hopefully it's the beginning of a great career for Lewis. The other standouts in the cast include Neal Mcdonough as an initially gung-ho soldier who undergoes the greatest transformation after he's shot in battle, Donnie Wahlberg as a thoughtful private who's quickly promoted through the ranks, and Matthew Settle as an enigmatic soldier who's so calm in the heat of combat, he almost becomes a living legend.Puncuating the moments of character interaction are the battle scenes, which are numerous, graphically violent, and often ferociously intense. Given the miniseries' 10 hour running time, you should prepare yourself for probably more battle action than any war film you've ever seen. The combat presented is harrowingly realistic, often resembling Spielberg's own work in Saving Private Ryan (methinks the fact he served as executive producer here is the main reason for all the similarities). The standout segment is the drop over D-day, sporting the most hair-raising aerial combat I've ever seen. The sight of paratroopers desperately trying to make their jump as flak threatens to down their plane is among the most terrifying sights I've ever seen.The other battle sequences focus on infantry combat.  The miniseries does an excellent job of conveying rigorous gun battles and ubiquitous artillery.  These scenes display a fair amount of clever strategy, particularly when Easy Company tries to disarm several German artillery sites, and do an excellent job of showing the difficulty of fighting in a variety of different settings (small towns such as Carentan, as well as snow-covered forests and villages).The production values are all first-rate. The special effects are mostly outstanding and the miniseries truly has the look and feel of the time period. Without a doubt, every penny of this 125 million dollar budget was well-spent.  Less successful than the production is Michael Kamen's score, which is actually pretty good; there's at least one adrenaline-pumping, rousing theme, but the music threatens to turn into schmaltz during the quieter moments.While dramatically powerful, Band of Brothers is never quite emotionally devastating (unlike Saving Private Ryan, which is what makes BOB slightly inferior to it), with perhaps the exception of Part 9, which focuses on the discovery of a concentration camp. It's eerily disturbing, horrific, and every bit as graphic as what was featured in Schindler's List. Band of Brothers is flawed, but its pros by far outweigh the cons. This is an experience not to be missed.	5.0	A miniseries to experience.	2002-11-20	13	10	3

Aired as a 12 part series, Band of Brothers documents the journey of a company of paratroopers in the days and months following the Allied beach-head at Normandy.Directed by Steven Spielberg, and with an excellent cast of mostly unknowns (the occasional recognizable actor notwithstanding), Band of Brothers captures for 12 episodes what Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List did for a few hours each.If you love WWII history, buy this DVD.  If you love good acting and writing, buy this DVD.  Heck just buy it!  You will not be disappointed and I think more than one person will sit through all 12 episodes in a weekend, pining for more at the end.	5.0	A fine memorial to the greatest generation	2002-08-07	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A39CW1GW8IVWC	Eric Reich	After waiting many months for this series to come out on Blu-Ray, it came out in time for me to purchase it for my father for Christmas. Needless to say, he spent the next 5 days after Christmas watching straight through all 10 episodes. He confided in me that it was one of the best gifts he had ever received. The gripping plot, excellent sound, amazing picture all added up to a worthwhile gift. Highly recommended to just about any history/action buff.	5.0	Awesome gift for any guy	2009-01-03	0	0	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1PEKEZTSDJAVH	Eric San Juan	First and foremost is this: If you're a fan of World War II films, whether of the epic-in-scope variety or the up-close-and-personal type, purchase this DVD set right now. You'll not regret it, and without question you'll watch all ten hours multiple times.Band of Brothers is a well-crafted, well-produced ten-hour epic following the exploits of one World War II Company from their pre-combat training, through D-Day and on through the end of the war. While it focuses on this one company - Easy Company - the series is without question epic in scope, featuring hundreds of actors, a huge cast, fantastic sets that capture WWII Europe and magnificent combat scenes.On the personal side, Band of Brothers allows you to get to know a rotating cast of core characters very well, with most of camera time focusing on a solid six to eight soldiers in Easy Company. The performances throughout are excellent, giving you a good understanding of and sympathy for the men portrayed on screen. Lovers of war film camaraderie will love large portions of this series (which, to me, is almost more of a ten-hour film than a miniseries) thanks to some good chemistry.On the epic side, Band of Brothers shines, mixing equal parts Saving Private Ryan and A Bridge Too Far to give viewers a sense of the grand scale in which this small band is fighting. The vistas are stunning, the action powerful, and fighting brutal. From the huge drop the night before D-Day to sieges of French towns to the shelling at Bastogne and more, this series thrills with its exciting, often gruesome combat footage.No, the price tag on this hefty set isn't small, but it's undoubtedly worth it, as you'll want to watch your favorite installments over and over again. Even if this set featured only the very best episodes (2, 3, 5, 7, and the very moving 9) it would be worth every penny. But this now.	5.0	Compelling, well made WWII epic that's also personal	2003-07-07	1	1	0

A the end of this series, especially Why We Fight, one feels they actually know these men even though most are now deceased.  The portrayals clearly convey the sacrifices these men, and women, made in defeating National Socialism.  Facisim is a term all too often cast about to demean someone with whom others disagree.

You didn't feel nearly as invested in the characters and their situations. Don't get me wrong, &#34;The Pacific&#34; was a pretty great series as well, but it feels a bit sprawling and not cohesive enough after watching BoB.Powerful, emotional, graphic, unrelenting, and stark, BoB takes you through the war with Easy Company and gives you a perspective.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1PQLR0EN31PE8	E. Smith	Once in awhile, a series, movie, or song comes along and when you witness it, you are happy that you did.  BAND OF BROTHERS is one of those series.  It's the production of HBO, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks (executive producers) and it tells the story of Easy Company of the 101st airborne during World War II.  Every single thing you see is based on facts and I think that is what makes the story so compelling.  The series is composed of 10 episodes, each and hour long and like I said it charts the progress of Easy Company as told by the men who served with the company.  The acting in this series is not only first class, but world class as well.  None of the actors are well known at all (except David Schwimmer) and I think by using unknowns you don't have a lot of over acting.  I hope that the actors that portrayed the real life characters get picked up for other things.  Anyway, the DVD comes in a 6 disc set with 2 shows on each disc and the 6th disc full of bonus features.	5.0	A MUST OWN!!!	2002-12-14	8	7	1

The main characters are all so different, as we all are, in real life. It is nice to see how the bond of friendship and loyalty developed with the men of Easy Company.

The pace was fast but not hectic, the visuals were evocative, and the characters were well-acted and as a viewer you felt a bond that most shows fail to create. Band of Brothers had the quality of Saving Private Ryan without the superstar fluff of having Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Vin Diesel, etc., distracting from the story. Damian Lewis delivered a tour de force performance and is backed by a phenomenal supporting cast of up-and-comers and underrated veterans of acting. David Schwimmer sheds his Friends stereotype of &#34;good guy&#34; Ross Geller in a matter of seconds as well, adding to an already great cast. Hands down the most evocative and incredible piece of small-screen art I've ever seen.	5.0	The best thing to ever happen to television	2014-06-16	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1IK1W34F5MDLV	FantasyGuy_2002	The Band of Brothers is a TV miniseries following the lives of the 101st Airborne's Easy Company during World War Two. There are depictions of D-Day, Normandy, Market Garden, Battle of the Bulge(Bastogne), and many more. Not only do they show the fighting and all the action of those times, the main focus was centred in on the emotions on the soldiers. Whether it is a loss of a friend, a cold winter morning in the 'foxholes', trench foot, brutal amputations and surgeries, the guilty conscience after a victory, or shortages of food supplies, medical supplies(bandages, morphine, plasma), or other utensils, each emotion is displayed powerfully and realitically so that it dominates the entire show...Definately is the best WW2 depiction of all time and is a must see for war movie watchers...(Warning: Contains intense violence, blood and gore, and occaisional strong language)	5.0	Excellent Movie Describing the Life of WW2 Soldiers.	2002-11-06	1	1	0

At times you feel you are dug into the trenches with these guys and it is really more of a human story rather than the senseless violence often associated with war movies.  Best part is, it is based on a true story and some of the guys are still around to recount what happened.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A126PX54V9JW0B	franburst	If anyone thinks that learning names, dates, places for historical events is boring in school, this movie is an example of the thrilling stories that unfold when you learn history.  The movie is the story of the invasion of Europe for the 101st Airborne Division from their training to the end of the war.  The relationships among the soldiers, their emotions, their battles against the enemy and their very survival is told in the very dramatic story that was the reality of the history.I watched the 10 episodes in a two day time period replacing the TV evening schedules.  This was far better entertainment than anything else on the tube.  I don't subscribe to HBO or any of the cable or dish companies.  I use an antenna for network tv and find that is enough, especially since I can actually get anything I want to see over the internet by going to the station web site or via Amazon and Netflix.The only reason I didn't give Band of Brothers five starts is that I found that once I got into episodes 5-7, I became a little battle weary myself and skipped through some of the battle scenes.  This should not detract from the high quality of this series and the true to life history that was being portrayed.  The acting was superb as was everything else about this series.	4.0	Captivating History	2014-05-31	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A8VPO4TPQTHZ7	Frank A. Terry Jr.	"I rated this series 5 stars.  If I could, I'd give another 5 stars.I can't recommend this collection highly enough.  It should be shown in schools to let the kids of today really understand WWII and the men who fought it.Everything about this production is first class; writing, directing, cinematography and acting.  Saving Private Ryan was the training ground for Spielberg and Hanks to make this tribute to not only E Company but everyone who has been to war.I had dropped HBO years before, but got a subscription long enough to tape all 10 episodes and the documentary ""We Stand Alone Together"" where you get to meet some of the real men from Easy Company depicted in the series.  After you see the entire series, you will know the men and understand how and why they react as they did in certain situations.  You also learn how arbitrary, painful, and senseless war is. This should win all 19 Emmey Awards it's been nominated for.The book ""Band of Brothers"" by Stephen Ambrose (the basis for the series) is a great read as well and the series follows the text almost to the letter.  A tribute to Ambrose for writing a book that could translate to the screen completely intact.This is a must for any DVD collection."	5.0	The Way It Was	2002-08-29	6	5	1

Being of a generation that didn't talk about the things that happened, and internalized all the stress and issues that accompanied such service, this program opened my eyes to what really happened.  I have an Uncle that I never met that was killed during the Battle of the Bulge, and seeing what occurred during that time was infinitely difficult to watch, but it certainly made me appreciate the sacrifice that our military people made in the name of protecting that which was most precious to them...their Country and the need to keep their families free to live in peace and freedom.

The fanfold construction of this package requires a table to get to the first disc.  Others with double discs that require removing one disc to get to the other are just a pain.  It's possible with slim cases which hold one disc per side to keep the packaging costs down (not, I suspect, a consideration in the case of BoB) without making them impossible to handle.

This show does the book justice,  it follows easy co. 506th from training to d-day and all the way to the end of the war. You become attached to the men like George Lutz,  Richard Winters, and Carwood Lipton, plus the other larger than life men in the company. It gives one the understanding that it wasn't always about orders and intel. Sometimes you just have to make decisions on the fly and hope for the best.

Not tied to a particular 'scenario'of sorts, the way the scripting and cast meld together so well one actually feels their presence as if you were almost in the trenches with them.  When I initially watched the series as it first aired, I found myself glued not only to the action scenarios but to the personal lives of each individual in Easy Company.

So, after I missed the first part, I decided to wait until it came out on DVD.  It seemed like a long arduous wait, but the product released made it all worthwhile.Not only is this mini-series one of the most exhilarating war stories ever told, it is told by the courageous men of Easy Company themselves. When you watch and listen to the veterans talk about their experiences (at the beginning of each part) and then watch the story unfold as they go through basic training and end the war at Obersalzberg (Eagles Nest), you feel a certain gratitude towards these men and the sense that the words ""Thank You"" just aren't enough.You will see how brotherhoods are formed, the cruelties of war (yes, we were cruel also), and many of the sad misfortunes that go along with war.  This isn't just a mini-series for entertainment purposes, it's a documentary.The six DVD set comes in a collector's tin and folds out with five of the DVDs that have the ten part story on them and one additional documentary DVD.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AWQX4UWE0NRK	German Cold War Infantry Officer	"The movie is the one of the most realistic war movie I have ever seen. Beeing an officer by myself I sense that the movie is based on a detailed description of the veterans.There is only one thing I don't like. The view of the Easy company is a very selective one. Obviously they were lucky and survived the war and they were on the winner side. The americans can sure be proud of their troops freeing Europe. WWII was started by Hitler and this was a horrible crime which did cost 50 Million people their lives. The Germans know that and are not very keen on going to war any more. We hate war today! But there are several things the western allies tend to forget:The big and horrible fighters of the war about which the german veterans of WWII are talking about were the russians and surely not the americans. At the time of D-Day 750.000 German troops were fighting 1,5 million allied soldiers in normandy. 4,5 Million troops were fighting the russians at the eastern front at that time. 3,5 Million German soldiers died in whole WWII. German soldiers killed 11 Million russians soldiers in the most horrifing battles the world has every seen. The German soldiers always fought against an enemy who outnumberd them by far (except the little countries in the beginning) in soldiers and tanks. They could only perfom like that because of an huge fighting spirit, oustanding training, flexiblity and superior tactics. Please keep in mind how a country of 80 million people can fight against nearly the whole world (including the two later super powers) for 6 years! So think about the German soldiers fleeing in the movie BoB.At the time d-day started our best soldiers were already killed in russia. The russians were killed and taken prisoners in the early 40ies in huge numbers (f.e.g. 1,5 million russian casulties and PoW in only one battle). But still they fought and fought and fought. Our veterans are so impressed by the russian people and are still talking about them with lots of respect. The russians are truely brave soldiers.Compared to that nearly no one was a lot impressed by american fighting power. The only thing the old ones are talking about is about the superb american airforce. In average the german russia-vetrans who also fought in france in the end said: ""Shoot at an US tank with your gun in despair (because you have nothing else to fight it with) then they stop and call for the airforce"". No russian fighting spirit but very human for the american troops. The US had everything: A lot of tanks (weak sherman tanks but a lot of them), airpower, supply.... The germans at that time were the remains of an already by the russians defeated army. That they still fought with nearly nothing, beeing attacked by all directions ( form east, from west and from the south) while their families are beeing murdered by american phosphoros bombs and low flying fighter planes shooting at women and children after the bombing raids (which were war crimes nobody is talking about nowadays => Dresden)is possibly unique in history.I am only writing about all this because americans tend to be so proud of themselves that they forget about truth and overall history. BoB is a very good and realistic movie of a lucky company who caught the enemy in surprise or in total defeat. But it is not a movie to show children in order to learn about WWII!!Don't get me wrong I am not anti-US. I am glad they were part of freeing us. I also hate the criminal nazis who terrorized the whole world and (not to forget) the germans themselves.I am also glad the US is willing to go for dictators like Sadam Hussein.But: War is not a game. War is not a TV-Reality-Show on CNN. War is no movie. War is not example for the US for beeing the only ones who suffer and who are brave.If you interpret BoB like that. The world is not getting better.So watch this good movie and use your brain!!"	4.0	Good and generally realistic war movie!	2003-04-27	89	56	33

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1A9WXPQVE7D87	GFX	"Television as a medium takes a good deal of criticism for basically being intellectual garbage devoid of anything good.  200 channels and nothing to watch just is as common as it is ironic.Band of Brothers changed that for me.  This DVD set is a must for anyone who is interested in military history or simply a compelling story.  Truth is stranger than fiction.  It is also more compelling.The 10 episodes are generally good but there were one or two that I did not think measured up to the rest.  Each was directed by a different director and took different views of the events from the book.  With each episode being somewhat encapsulated by this, yet the series is basically, chronological.  In turn this makes the 600 or so minutes of program go through many emotional and stressful change ups.My personal favorites are the first three episodes and the holocaust episode.  The first two do a great job of setting up the company and the individual men.  The thirs is D-Day and does an incredible job of showing how terrible and confusing combat is.  The Holocaust episode I thought was one of the strongest though.  It was simply a fine example of soldiers coming across a concentration camp and not knowing exactly what it was about.  The horrors and atrocities speak for themselves and are very much put into the context of the episode rather than preaching the obvious facts that Nazi's were despicable.From a production values perpective, Band of Brothers is incredible.  Watching the ""making of"" really illustrated how much effort went into the show.  There were a few minor technical issues, like red telephone boxes in WWII UK (those popped up after the war, according to a Brit friend watching along with me).Band of Brothers is worthy of any DVD library and one of the best things to be shown on TV that was not a sporting event."	5.0	Truth is stranger than fiction and far more compelling	2003-05-25	1	1	0

I am about half way through the series and have fully enjoyed each episode, and cannot wait to watch the next one. I am taking my time with it because I want it to last. First off, the price was excellent. I purchased it for $39.99 with free shipping, the day it was on sale other customers were stating that they bought it for $31.99 and were saying $39.99 was too much. $39.99 is still a great price considering it is about eighty bucks at best buy, not to mention it is the best audio and video I have seen on Blu Ray yet.People talk about how Planet Earth is really good as well, I own them both and BOB is much better. The only gripe I could make was during the first couple episodes it was difficult to keep track of the soldiers during the initial battle scenes....I was also a little distracted watching the first couple of episodes, so it is probably just me. The additional features are great with commentary from the real members of Easy Company. I never knew the series was a true story, which makes it even better. You will not be disappointed and will be hooked and mesmerized instantly.

I have never seen such an impressively researched and presented epic, probably because it is the truth (unvarnished) from those that were there.  The producers really did it right by using actors who were previously unknown to American audiences, thus instead of concentrating on the actors and their work in other venues, we tend to pay more attention to the actual story.  This movie is a must for students of history.  I was also impressed that no conclusions on war are drawn other than 'war is hell' and soldiers do what they must.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A16FUU8WW76QFY	gork57	The ads for 'Band of Brothers' state that 'you will never be the same after watching this miniseries', and they are right.  Scenes tend to stick with you; the artillery barrage in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge (with one soldier being badly wounded, and his cohort suffering the same fate while trying to help him).  A young Medic befriends a Belgian nurse in a church, only to later find the building she was treating the wounded in destroyed - and her most likely dead.This is as real as a war film can get.  It has the same look that 'Saving Private Ryan' had.  The airborne drops, the artillery, the gruesome wounds, the pain and fear held within until the battle is over.  'Brothers' grabs and shakes you - this is something like what our WWII veterans carry inside them.  The memory of dead friends, the fear of making new ones because they will most likely die fast due to lack of combat experience.My dad was one of those soldier/brothers; he fought in that poor sister to the famous D-Day campaign in France: Italy.  It was a filthy, slogging mess, with vicious fighting in such places as Salerno, Anzio, and Monte Cassino.  Italy was the first place American soldiers confronted the Germans on the European Continent, but was placed on the back burner after June 6, 1944.War is indeed a terrible thing - just ask our young men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan today.  It is not glorious or wonderful.  It is bloody, murderous hell.  It is long periods of boredom interrupted by moments of high adrenaline, sheer terror.  It is devotion to those Brothers and Sisters around you - and it is carrying the crystal clear memories of all of it for the rest of your life here on earth.  And 'Band of Brothers' comes as close as possible to actually being there with them.Thanks, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, and all those involved in bringing us this most striking example of filmmaking.  It is a piece of American history that all citizens present and future should see.  It is the price of freedom that so many take for granted.	5.0	Realism Defined	2004-04-15	8	5	3

It is certainly the finest television I have ever seen, and easily joins with Roots, Holocaust, as one of the seminal works of television.  It is impossible not to follow this series and garner respect for the men being portrayed in Easy Company - and all soldiers of this and every war.Although billed as a mini-series, it really is a ten hour film of such sweeping power that words practically fail me to describe the overwhelming emotions I experienced while watching Band of Brothers.  From boot camp through the end of the war, we get to know these men, see their hopes and lives dashed, the promise of living unfulfilled in too many cases and just what the ravages of war cost us all.The battle scenes are terrifyingly realistic in their reenactments, the acting, direction, attention to every detail nothing less than perfect.  While each episode is a masterpiece, for some reason episode 6 ""Bastogne"" seemed to especially resonate for me and it was impossible to watch this episode without viewing it through tears.There's not much more to say than ""Band of Brothers"" may be the finest film, television, whatever you want to call it that I've ever seen."	5.0	Bar None:  The Finest Television Series Ever	2005-02-04	11	9	2

By the end, you're so invested with ""Easy Company"" that the slight ""twist"" at the end will just leave you completely breathless.A lot of folks compare this to Saving Private Ryan.  Well, OK.  Some of the same people were involved and it has the same look.  But because this has more range and flexibility I think it is by far a superior experience to Ryan.With all of the ""super hero"" movies (which I like) permeating the box office, it's nice to watch something with real life superheroes.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2XC723XT2PD2W	Greg	Band of Brothers is a very good look at what soldiers went through in world war II. It focues on Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne. Unlike the book, it focuses on many of the people in the company, from the Lieutenants to the private.Episode One is a kind of drama comedy type thing. It begins with the company training in Camp Taccoa with their first CO, played by David Schwimmer from Friends. It follows them from here to the take off of the 101st to Normandy.The second episode takes place in Normandy. It begins with great special effects of the landing in the company. From there it shows the handful of the E Company men that came down in the right place take some artillery enplacments.The third episode is on the of the first episodes to focus on mainly one man. The company is still in Normandy and forming up. Albert Blithe, a private, is the main guy in this one. He is a coward and it shows how he overcomes his fears. Also in this episode the company takes Carentan and a ridge. They then return to England.Episode four is the drop into Holland. E Company takes part in Operation Market Garden. Bull Randlemen is the main guy in this one, is a Sergeant who has many replacements to handle.Episode Five is in Holland as well. We focus on the current Captain of the comapany in this one and see a platoon take dike.Episode six is one of the most terrifying episodes there is. It is in Bastogne in the battle of the bulge where the 101 is surrounded. Medic Eugene Roe is the focus in the this one where we see how bad the casualties were in this battle and the sacrafices of the medics and women volunteers in the war.Episode 7. This one is the most sad one of the ten. We see many people we like die in shellings and a man break. The company takes a village.Episode eight. Tom Hank's son is in this one as a replacment Lieutenant who becomes friends with a private in the company. The company is ordered by regiment to go across a river they are watching to take prisoners in a patrol.Episode nine. Easy Companys in Germany and some men who are out on patrol find a concentration camp. In this episode you will see many men who look so hardended by combat but that the concentration camp is too much from them.Episode ten. Easy Company takes Hitler Eagles Nest in this one and goes to Austria where they live a dream life. But they dont enjoy this too much because the division is going to Japan.Overall this is one miniseries and war movie you have to see.	5.0	A Good Look at Combat in World War II	2005-08-05	1	1	0

In contrast to the pacific theater there is no jungling fighting and the Germans did not come in droves  in front of machine gun nests to kill their enemy.  Both sides fought for each inch of land not with out casualties.  I played close attention to shifty powers a good old country boy from Southern VA who was a crack shot and saved many lives.  All were brave and from different backgrounds and this is what I think made the 506 th the division it was, different skill were brought in by the city boys and different skills were brought in by the country boys.Excellent miniseries.	5.0	What Can you say	2013-08-16	1	1	0

While this is a retelling of  the experiences of Easy Company of the newly invented Airborne Infantry, one should not disregard it because it came from Hollywood heavyweights Spielberg and Hanks.  Quite the opposite, it is because of them and the book by renowned World War II historian Stephen Ambrose that this movie is so un-Hollywood.  I cannot do the series justice by recounting the reasons why you should watch it.  The other reviewers have mentioned `propaganda' and `indiscriminate killings' as reasons not to believe the story.  I hate to break it to them, but that happens during wars.  I've seen a lot of things and if you want to see the closest facsimile to the real thing, see this.	5.0	Watch This!	2003-04-14	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1Z4VB9DA01AXP	"Gregory Canellis ""Student of military history..."	Without a doubt, HBO's mini-series based on Stephen E. Ambrose's book _Band of Brothers_, is the best war film ever produced! Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks has proven unequivocally that the old adage &quot;truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction,&quot; holds true. Realism and an undauted quest to bring to the screen the actuality of the combat experience in an infantry company, resonates in the countless themes exhibited throughout the film. The production team, that consisted of eight directors, including Hanks, has accomplished an extraordinary feat both on and beneath the surface of this remarkable mini-series. What the viewer sees in this action-packed movie will delight the staunchest war film aficionado. The directors utilize the same revolutionary cinematography techniques first seen in Spielberg's prior effort, &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; The chaotic hand-held camera work places the viewer right in the heart of the battle scenes. The addition of all the latest computer generated special effects, clearly confirms how great a war movie can be when backed by a big budget (lucky for us Spielberg is a World War II buff). The night jump over Normandy is arguably the best battle sequence ever shot on film. But it is the countless themes beneath the surface of the film that makes &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; a true gem, and destined to become a film classic. Let us always remember that this is not only the story of an elite Airborne company, but of the actual men who made up Easy Company. The Army succeeded in molding these men into a fine-tuned combat effective team through the most intense, rugged mental and physical training. Individuality is discarded and team-work is exemplified if one is to survive in combat. Yet regardless of the level of training, it is human beings that are sent into combat, and Easy Company's rank and file consisted of individuals of varying and diverse human attributes and character defects. And the film illustrates the &quot;humanity&quot; of Easy Company beautifully. The 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment had good and bad leaders. The outstanding and natural leadership abilities of its level-headed commander Captain (later Major) Richard Winters (Damien Lewis) are off-set my many who could not make the grade. Anyone in a managerial position at any corporate level would benefit from watching the varying leadership styles depicted in this film. Likewise, a handful of youths filled with a volatile mixture of naivety and bravado will, through fire and death, become a solid cadre of N.C.O's. Their role is vital not only to a successful combat mission, but also to the survival of green replacements. Yet the horrors of war affected all ranks within Easy Company and the producers wisely chose not to sugar-coat anything. Alcoholism and the murder of enemy prisoners by officers and enlisted men alike, are very real themes boldly conveyed in the film. Combat exhaustion, or &quot;battle fatigue&quot; is another unpleasant topic displayed in the film. Men who could not be broken physically (several of Easy Company men recovered from wounds and went A.W.O.L from hospital to rejoin their unit), succumbed to the mental strain of constant exposure to enemy fire. Looting, murder and a general callousness towards the German civilian population after witnessing the horrors of a concentration camp, are also very real occurrences that took place within the entire European Theater at war's end. Band of Brothers is not only an action-packed and riveting war picture, but also an accurate social history of the American G.I. in World War II. Any combat veteran, particularly those who fought in Europe, can relate to the experiences (both internal and external) of these men. Any relative of a combat veteran, regardless of what unit he served, will gain a better understanding of their loved-one's experiences. Captains Winters, Nixon; Lieutenant Speirs, Compton; Sergeants Lipton, Martin, Randleman, Toye, Guarnere, Malarkey and others are not made-up characters, they are real men. And it is their real-life experiences, so accurately captured in this film that defies any screenwriter's pen. I cannot recommend this package highly enough.

I would have loved to have a private conversation on such with him, but since there was no way to do so I put my rebuttal to his comments here.  I would love to live in his world, where looking at the cause of the war and saying that should have been stopped gives you a moral superiority.  Something should have been done to stop the rise of the Nazis in the 20s, but what would he suggest.  Since the Nazi party was elected into power in Germany, what would have been a possible solution other than a preemptive strike to prevent the mounting problem that wasn&#65533;t an obvious aggression until the mid 1930s?  And yes, those who then defended themselves when that aggression was unleashed are truly evil.  I mean, what right does any man have to prevent his life from being taken by another.  I suppose we would have all been better off to sit back and watch, hoping that it didnt come after us next.  Childish is believing that the world is black and white.  Killing is evil, so anyone who would kill for whatever reason is evil.  That&#65533;s great, as long as everybody refrained from being evil, but since asking someone to do so doesn&#65533;t always work we must sometimes resort to fighting to stop it.  Man, would I love there to never be another war, because it is the most horrible thing in this world.  Tell me though Ian Cooper, what does it being the AD age have to do with an end to war.  War has been a constant for the span of human civilization, and only 20 years before the world had its first world war.  What is it about the late 1930s that makes you believe that there should have been some huge philosophical awakening and a pacifist resolve in the world?  Stop being a child.  The war wasn&#65533;t provoked, it wasn&#65533;t asked for by the millions who died trying to end it.  There are only to ways to end aggression; to fight it, or to curl up in a ball and hope they stop kicking you.  The latter rarely ends with you standing up and walking away.  Your solution is that we hope it doesn&#65533;t happen and then hope for restraint on the part of the aggressor if it does.  Good luck with that.	5.0	Ian Cooper, as misguided as the Nazis	2003-11-12	11	7	4
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A33JPVYZOTTB8Q	Growly Pants	"Simply the BEST ""television"" show ever produced. No questions. This is flawless, a real masterpiece. Thank you Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg for bringing ""Saving Private Ryan"" to our television sets. Actually, I believe this should have been a movie. I dont care how long it would have run, people would have sat through it. But with todays televisions and surround sound systems, ones home theater if often just as impressive as the local mega-cinema.Anyway.....on to the review. I cannot stress enough how well done this show is. With interviews with the REAL men featured in this epic, it really gives the viewer a sense that they're watching a moving, bleeding, crying, biography. What these men went through!!! The series begins in the U.S. military boot camp, where recruits are preparing, both mentally and physically, for the rigors of combat (if one can actually PREPARE for such a thing). Although the first couple of episodes are a little slow at times, they are important to understand the cohesion of the military units and how this cohesion was obtained. But once D-Day arrives......the action REALLY heats up.Being dropped over Normandy on the night before D-Day so they can take important bridges and roadways from the Germans, as well as knocking out big artillary guns that can reign hot metallic death upon the troops landing on the Normandy beaches from MILES away, the boys (and they are just boys) of the 101st Airborne, Easy Company are loaded into gliders and troop transport aircraft for what they were TOLD would be an easy parachute drop into occupied France.As soon as these terrified, shivering, airsick men cross the coast onto coastal Normandy.....all hell breaks loose. Antiaircraft fire literally paints the sky from one end of the horizon to the other. Many planes are blown out of the sky and drop, in flames, to a fiery death below. Others are shredded by shrapnel, tearing apart the young men who are experiencing the horror of combat for the first time, sending them tumbling to the ground below. The pilots panic, they know they're gonna get killed if the dont get out of there ASAP, so they unload their cargo and,in 99% of the cases, they were WELL short of their planned landing sites.Easy Company bails out, hot shrapnel exploding in the air around them, the smell of cordite and gun powder burning their nostrils and seeping into their clothes. They're breathing hard, often hyperventilating. Their eyes are huge with fright. Some wet their pants. Some are shot to pieces by German ground troops as they float lazily through the hell that's surrounding them.When they land, they are lost. Lost in a foreign country where almost everyone they encounter is going to try to kill them. And they dont speak the language. They ditch their parachutes and head out in an attempt to hook up with their buddies.......with ANYONE who looks familiar, any American will do. Little by little they begin to find other Americans. One or two here, another couple of guys there. The men they're running into (sometimes literally) are often from other divisions, but who cares, they're still friendly faces.They begin to form little units and attempt to find their way to a meeting point or to where they were SUPPOSED to be originally. Often times, they encounter German soldiers. They hide in mud and flooded fields, they duck behind trees and hide in farm houses. Some are killed. They're as quiet as they can be. Their breath coming in short, frightened bursts. These ragtag groups of ""brothers"" band together and set out to do what they were THERE to do.By morning, many of the stragglers had met up at a local Norman town, waiting for their buddies and for their commanders, many of whom NEVER arrive. ""Band of Brothers"" is a war story, but first and foremost, its a story of friendship, dedication and commmitment.The series follows Easy Company from this horrific landing, through Operation Market Garden in Holland to the Battle of the Bulge and finally, to V-E day. Its a fabulous story, filmed in the same fashion as ""Saving Private Ryan"" giving the viewer the feeling that they are actually THERE with the troops, ducking as the bullets scream by, the shells explode, the blood runs and the men cry. The camera men run along with the actors. Everything is filmed from the same level as the troops. As they run, the camera moves up and down, when shells explode, the camera shakes and quivers. It's really the most realistic way to film war. Anyone who's seen ""Saving Private Ryan"" knows exactly what I'm talking about. And the sound effects are equally as wonderful. Bullets actually whiz by overhead, ping off metal and rip into trees around you. Often you can see the trail of the bullets as they tear by at murderously close range. You'd jump into a bush and hide, cover your head from the branches falling around you if you could.It's extremely graphic, but its war. When someone is shot, its horrifying. They dont pause in mid step, grab their stomach, wince and fall to the ground. Their flesh is torn to pieces, bone blown out of the body, organs fall out. Blood pours freely and paints a ghastly picture on anyone in range of the spray. They scream in pain, they scream for their mothers. They die. Their buddies sob, they hold onto their bleeding, dying, disemboweled, friends and loose their minds. War is NOT pretty.Anyone who votes eagerly to go to war has never BEEN to war.At the end of this epic, I was in tears. What these innocent young boys were thrown into was enough to break even the hardest soul. But they did their job (proudly!!!!!) and some of them returned home. MANY didnt. This movie, as well as ""Saving Private Ryan"" should be mandatory viewing for all American High School students. Maybe then our future leaders wouldn't be so fast to vote for war.  The actors do a wonderful job. Many faces I had seen in other movies or television shows, many I had never seen before. Nobody super famous, but it's better that way, it's the WAR that's famous here and that gets all the attention. The emotion that these actors show was amazing, its almost (and this is gonna sound super corny) like they channeled the spirits of these fine young soldiers, portraying them with the zeal, determination and pride that they deserve.I recommend this movie to anyone. Its reality brought to the big screen. Watch it (preferably in surround sound....loud). And next time you see an old man wearing a basball hat with his batallions insignia on it, remembering something that he experienced 60 years ago, THANK HIM, for what he sacrified for you (yes YOU) is astounding. And remember those who didnt return from this war, for what THEY sacrificed........was everything."	5.0	BEAUTIFUL, HORRIFIC, FRIGHTENING, TOUCHING. WAR.	2005-06-18	10	7	3

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A12L5LKHKW8M3	"G. Soots ""Gary"""	"I read Stephen Ambrose's 1992 book Band of Brothers in 2009 while I was laid up in the hospital due to a motorcycle accident.  As a 20 year Army Retiree and First Sergeant I have affection for reading the real stories of men in combat.  This mini-series was first aired on September 9, 2001, two days prior to 9-11.  I had not seen the mini-series until after reading the book.  With many movies it is often said not to read the book first, or that reading the book will sometimes ruin the movie.  This was not the case with the mini-series as I don't believe it made a difference one way or the other.  So here are my thoughts on this powerful work of art focusing on the bravery of the men that made up ""the greatest generation.""This is a great mini-series from many standpoints.  First the storyline is taken from the book Band-of-brothers by Stephen Ambrose.  Ambrose researched the material and conducted many interviews with the actual soldiers.  The series is a chronicle of Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.  The series revolves around the actual members of this unit and in particular around Dick Winters, the man who will eventually command ""Easy Company"" through the majority of combat they see in Europe.  The series begins with the men at their airborne training in Taccoa, Georgia.  Initially, the company is led by Lieutenant, later Captain, Herbert Sobel.  Sobel is hated by the men for his tyrannical approach to leadership, a method despised by Winters who would never-the-less credit some of Sobel's methods with actually helping the men in combat.  David Schwimmer, from Friends fame, does a very good job portraying the much hated Sobel.  The men begin to migrate towards Winters (Damian Lewis) as he becomes their protector.  Because of Winters and the time at Toccoa, the men of Easy Company build strong attachments that will see them through some horrific times in combat.  One key friendship is that of Winters and Lewis Nixon, played by Ron Livingston.  Nixon is a fellow second lieutenant and, even though leaving the Company prior to the Invasion of Normandy, is always close to Winters.  There are many other friendships that emerge through the series and unlike fictional movies, these friendships are real and continue throughout their lives.  These friendships are very important to the 10 episode series as is the bond formed by the entire company.  This bond separates this mini-series from its follow on ""The Pacific"" an equally masterful piece about the Pacific Theater of Operation which is told through the eyes of a select few individuals and based upon their wartime memoirs.The combat begins after a train up period in England.  The second Episode ""Day of days"" revolves around the invasion of Normandy, D-Day.  The company is now in the middle of real combat, combat they have trained for yet they lose many men during the invasion.  A critical loss is that of their commander, who had replaced Sobel in England after the Easy Company NCOs threatened to resign if Sobel remained in command.  With the new Easy Company Commander gone, Winters is now moved into that role which he will hold for much of the remainder of the war until he is promoted.  The next seven episodes involve the combat operations that move Easy Company through France, Holland, and Belgium and then eventually into Germany.  The most horrific of these battles are those of Bastogne and the follow on battle of Foy.  Winters, now a Captain, has been moved up to Battalion as the executive officer.  The company suffers with the loss of his leadership which is not corrected until the battle of Foy when Winters has the Easy Company commander relieved by Lieutenant Speirs (Matthew Settles) who will be the final Commander of Easy.The series winds down with the final two episodes showing the reality of the slaughter Hitler has undertaken against the Jews and other ""undesirables"" and the dangers of a post war occupation as well.  Through all of this you follow the men of Easy and cheer their triumphs as you weep for their losses.  The cinematography is excellent as is the costuming and technical aspects of the period.  As James Cameron did with Titanic, the directors and producers of Band of Brothers painstakingly researched the time period.  They ensured they had the correct uniforms, rifles, pistols, battle sequences and other references to ensure the historical reality of the series.  Again, this chronicles real men, so the Hollywood glitz and ""bang"" of fake combat is replaced by realistic portrayal.This series is one of the truly accurate and remarkable portrayals of the life of soldiers in the World War II European Theater.  Band of Brothers will keep you entertained while reminding you of the sacrifices made for our Nation by these brave, yet humble, heroes."	5.0	Superb WWII Portrayal	2011-04-02	6	6	0

Not only are the ten episodes simply great viewing, they tell the true stories of some truly great American men.  The filmmaking is incredible, above the warfare cinematography of Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers..., (all of which were excellent movies) and all other war movies, in my opinion.  There is just something so gripping about WWII, that other movie conflicts seem to pale in comparison.The special features on each disk are very nice.  You get biographies of the Easy Company troops that appeared in those episodes, a list of ranks and insignia, and other goodies.  There is a great ""making of"" vignette, and behind the scenes photos, too.  This is a simply great purchase, though the cost is kinda high.  Of course, it is worth it, esp. since there are so many disks in it, but in one shot it is a little painful."	5.0	WOW	2003-06-12	2	2	0

Didn't like the language though and haven't watched Pacific yet.  My 44 yr. old Son, David, said it was good but too much bad language in it for his young Son, Sam to watch.  I know using swear words is prevelant in real life but when I was in Korea, even in the tough times I don't remember hearing swearing all that much. When I watch it I will let you know what I think.

All they go through, all they continued to go through after the war. I love that they have some of the actual men speaking at the beginning of each episode.  There are most certainly graphic scenes throughout (it's war) and the strength of these men, all of them, is incredible.How can you not respect the men (and now women) that fight, give their lives for a greater cause.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1CTXKA2C7BSC8	"Helen Hancox ""Auntie Helen"""	"It's taken me almost a year to watch this DVD set of Band Of Brothers - not because it's hard going (it isn't) but because I watch almost no television. Band Of Brothers has been almost the only thing that I've watched in the last twelve months and it's all the more impressive for that.Band Of Brothers follows the participation of Easy Company in the 101st Parachute Division in World War II. Starting with the Normandy landings and continuing right through to the taking of Berchtesgaden in Bavaria (Hitler's ""Eagle's Nest"" retreat) the ten episodes, each just under an hour long, are brilliant reconstructions of the war. Each episode has a different tone or theme, sometimes they focus on a different central character, all linked by Major Winters (played excellently by Damian Lewis) and the rest of Easy Company.The realism of the horror, speed and confusion of war is very clear from watching just one episode. The special effects used to show bullets zipping around were unlike anything I had seen before but the series wasn't just about action and fighting, it was just as much about the way that war affected the young men serving who watched their friends die and who sometimes found themselves in almost impossible situations.The episodes are topped and tailed by interviews by the real life soldiers dramatised in this film. Seeing them as old and very American-looking men helped to root the story in reality. Many of them became emotional when talking about the events that had taken place fifty years before - and having watched the series I can see why.As a snapshot of the war, and a warts 'n all snapshot at that, this series is excellent and it's a DVD collection that I can recommend unreservedly."	5.0	10 hours of brilliance	2007-03-02	3	2	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3GZFBXB2VOGI0	H. Lim	"I will review each episode of this series separately.EPISODE ONE: CURAHEEDepicts boot camp. This episode is actually one of the best, despite the lack of action. There is drama inherent in the attempts to oust the incompetent, cruel Cpt Sobel, without being executed for mutiny. The savagery of boot camp reminds one of Full Metal Jacket.EPISODE TWO: DAY OF DAYSDepicts the drop on D-Day. The main character is Dick Winters, who leads a vital attack on a German battery with only thirteen men. The fight scenes here are exquisite; and the shots of the drop itself - with flak and ack-ack flying everywhere - really make a mockery of The Longest Day!EPISODE THREE: CARENTANThis is my favourite episode. It depicts the travails of a quiet and nonviolent private named Albert Blithe. This episode is rather reminiscent of The Red Badge of Courage, with the viewer left wondering: does Albert Blithe find courage when he shoots the German?? - or does he become everything he dreads - a killer without remorse? My favourite scene is where Cpt Speirs, the cold-blooded killer, tries to convince Blithe not to have so many qualms about combat.Not only do you get this fine psychological drama, but you also get easily the bast battle-scene in the series - the tank battles to the southwest of Carentan. You've never seen a war-film until you've seen US Paratroopers fending off German Jagdpanther self-propelled guns! The Americans even counterattack in a dramatic (and historically accurate) tank-battle: the Shermans crash into the flank of the German armoured units, forcing them to retreat.This episode is perfectly scripted and acted, and would probably be Oscar material if it had been released cinematically.EPISODE 4: REPLACEMENTSNot as strong as the first three episodes, this depicts the Arnhem Campaign. Yet another tank battle, near Eindhoven, in which the British Cromwell tanks get trounced by none other than the famous German Tiger tanks. Very impressive. I have never seen a film with such realistic German tanks. The human element concerns the hobbit-like Sgt Bull Randleman, and his replacement-squad, which has to prove itself in battle.EPISODE 5: CROSSROADSThis episode has a very impressive battle against German SS infantry at the beginning - again, very accurately recreated. Dick Winters becomes head of Battalion, leaving Easy Company to Lt Dike. Not a particularly strong episode, lacks some structure. On the other hand, this is the episode directed by Tom Hanks; and there is some fine camera-work here, with striking imagery.EPISODE 6: BASTOGNEThis episode may be the weakest of the lot, with some poor acting and not-very-compelling scripting. But it is still worth watching. Hopeless love blossoms between medic Eugene and a Belgian nurse. This is the episode where McAuliffe is asked the surrender, and replies ""Nuts!!"" Not a lot of fighting or human story.EPISODE 7: THE BREAKING-POINTThis may possibly be the best episode, along with Episode 3. This episode truly captures the horrors of war. The constant shelling at the Battle of the Bulge has dreadful consequences as some of the company begin to go crazy. They are preparing to assault the village of Foy, near Bastogne. Led by the incompetent Lt Dike, Easy Company is slaughtered in the open. This film really shows what military incompetence can do., One is gritting one's teeth and yelling at Dike to get a move on!!!EPISODE 8: THE LAST PATROLThis is also one of the best, showing the effects of combat fatigue like no other film, not even PLATOON. Easy Company is so exhausted that they wander along half-asleep. Yet they are forced to defend Alsace from Hitler's new offensive. After the slaughter at Bastogne, one a few men are left in each platoon! Most tired of all is Malarkey, one of the most overworked men in the company.Contrasted with them are Webster, a man who has not seen the company since October 1944 and is treated like an outsider; and Jones, a freshfaced Westpointer who has just joined up. The contrast between the semi-conscious, fatigued Company and these two clean, fresh soldiers is unforgettable. The title refers to the patrol raid that takes place at the end of the episode - the last fight-scene in the series.EPISODE 9: WHY WE FIGHTThis is the episode where Easy Company relieves part of the Dachau complex of concentration and labour camps. Not one of the men is forewarned about such places, and one new recruit nearly goes crazy. Despite the accurate and affecting depictions of such horrors as walking skeletons and piles of corpses, and the fact that I like Beethoven string quartets, this episode is not actually very good. It lacks a certain dramatic unity.However, it is still well worth watching, especially to see the effects on Easy Company of seeing the Holocaust. Seeing the usually stolid and unmoveable Pte Bull Randleman vomiting is not something one forgets easily.No battle-scenes.EPISODE 10: POINTSThe episode that takes place after the surrounding of the Ruhr pocket. No battle scenes. Dull episode? Hardly! The episode is dramatic and intriguing, especially when the men liberate The Eagle's Nest at Rastenburg. It is moving to see the part near the end where we are told where the men all did after the war.I think I've gassed on long enough; I'll shut up now. But each episode of this series really is like a separate war film, and each deserves its own attention. Altogether the series is extremely impressive, and constitute my favourite war films."	5.0	Impressive	2003-01-09	1	1	0

Although I like the movie it follows a fictional storyline and sacrifices reality for hollywood in several parts.This series does none of that.  It is based off of the book written by the Ambrose, the eminent historian.  Best of all it gives many interviews from the actual stories that this is based upon.  Looking at the Real person and then seeing the actors portraying them on the screen was almost scary.  You would swear that each actor is the grandson of the person they are playing.Follow the story of Easy Company from basic until the end of the European campaign, you won't regret it.	5.0	Docudrama at its best	2005-08-19	3	3	0

The whole thing is so real and believable that you feel that you, yourself are a soldier in the war and you suffer with them, cry with them, feel with them.They are true heroes. Not made up like Captain America or Batman. This is their real story. It makes you think that without people like these, we wouldn't be where we are today. Truly magical!

When I saw this was out on Blu ray at a good price, it was a must buy. This set could easily be worth $100 in my opinion, but I have to say this is probably the best value on Blu Ray right now. The clarity of the video has to be seen to be believed, and the audio is top notch.As for the special features, each episode could probably be watched three times. Once just for the episode, one with a timeline that pops up facts and little video clips, and then once more with interviews popping up during the episode.This is a great buy, and if you are deciding whether or not the picture clarity is worth it, IT IS!

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2094KAP3ZC6RA	"Huwaryu ""huwaryu"""	"These are excellent films and are well done cinematically.  I've watched the whole thing from start to finish several times, and i especially like the ""We Stand Alone Together"" documentary.  The ""Field Guide"" on each disc is a valuable resource for those not familiar with military lingo, and the summaries of the soldiers are great little bios on the real men behind the partially fictionalized characters of the episodes.This is no perfect historical account, though.  While a majority of the stories on film sound a lot like the ones from the Ambrose book of the same title, there seem to be some inconsistencies with some other WWII sources; most notably David K. Webster's and Donald Burgett's, two guys who served with 2nd Batallion, 506th, throughout most of the ETO.  There are also huge gaps and missing paratroopers throughout the entire series.  Several men are interviewed in the documentary, but they don't show up in any of the episodes whatsoever, or are merely mentioned by name only (Earl McClung, JB Stokes).  Other troopers are showed only briefly (such as Ed Tipper), and many characters slip in and out of the stories without much explanation on their conspicuous absences.  (Other troopers who are named by Webster in his memoirs don't show up in the films, either...it's predominantly a view of the company from Dick Winters' perspective.)For example: Sargeant Ranney gets busted down to private in England in episode one, wins a service cross for his participation in the attack on the German guns in episode two, and then doesn't show up again for the rest of the series, with no explanation of his fate.  (He's also not listed with the KIA's at the end of the documentary... perhaps he was injured and discharged, or transferred.)Some of the actions are not described accurately, but this can be forgiven; sometimes the actual events weren't nearly as exciting and would have made lousy episodes if they were re-created exactly.Overall, the series does a good job of showing what it must have been like for some veterans, epsecially those who fought in the Bulge.  It is, however, a fictionalized account based on actual events, and should be viewed with that in mind.As with most Stephen Ambrose works, one gets the impression that the US, and specifically the 101st Airborne Division, won the war single-handedly, and this is hyperbole.  But it does make for great filmmaking, and any WWII buff should enjoy these films."	5.0	Great filmmaking; okay screenwriting	2004-08-23	10	8	2

I returned it and then in the second set I recieved the keepsake metal case was severly dented and the discs inside were flying around all over because the mechanisms which keep them in place were busted. I sent this one back for an exchange and amazon said they'll refund me, but won't send another. Fantastic. The way that this miniseries is packaged is setting it up for failure in shipping. Beware and try to buy it in a local store if possible, to minimize the beating it will recieve from UPS. Also, I noticed some people complaining that there were no English captions. They are available, but you must turn your TV's captions on just as you would if you were watching cable or satellite or whatever instead of finding them in the DVD menu.	4.0	Great...except for the amazon's shipping	2008-01-20	3	1	2

Friendships, failings, weaknesses, tears, and horrors aren't glorified. They're shown as is, to where I hated some characters for their weaknesses, hated others for their over done heroics and thirst for power and glory, and felt for the men that were just that, men that were human and performing the greatest glory of all, a service to their country. The cut-ins at the begining of each disc from the original men that this story revolves around and the pain and humor that still affects them after 60+ years, is touching and reveals a depth that will soon be lost to the younger generation.I'm a big fan of WWII movies and Band of Brothers is a cinematic beauty in both filming and history that bears watching again and again.	5.0	Uncut and Fabulous	2009-08-13	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1SAZB83QFR0W2	"JackOfMostTrades ""Jack"""	As a work of televised fiction, Band of Brothers is undoubtedly the best of its kind ever produced for American TV. If you find it as riveting as I did, you should watch the series in no more than two sittings, three at the most, or three episodes in a row. Each is over an hour, but you will get a much greater appreciation for the show as well as for the events it is based on than watching, say, one episode a day or week.  Why this is true could easily take a book-length analysis. So see for yourself.  If you are expecting a longer version of Saving Private Ryan, you'll realize your assumption is way off. Band of Brothers is far superior to the movie by Steven Speilberg, but again, you should see it for yourself. This is one DVD package that is definitely worth purchasing: it should become a classic. Or, let's put it this way: if it doesn't become a classic and is forgotten as are most TV 'mini-series', it will be a terrible day for America.  Regarding the production values, I found the series a true work of art. I'm a photographer and I viewed scene after scene, and episode after episode and could see the meticulous work that went into the filming, the lighting, the special effects, the attention to detail, etc. I've watched the series now five or six times, and every time I appreciate what I saw previously and notice details that I missed before. This is apart from the structural brilliance of many of the episodes. If you contemplate each one and review each episode's title, it becomes clear that each segment is a morality tale in and of itself. I believe the entire series took three years to make. I'm not surprised. It was evident the people involved in this series were deeply devoted to making it as good as possible. They succeeded.	5.0	American TV's Finest Hour (Hours)	2008-06-13	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2V3KKVW9K7A22	Jalla	"This is not a good war movie and the reviews here doesnt change that simply by the fact that americans dont know what war is. America hasnt experienced war on its soil affecting civillians. To americans war is a sport where you send some men to a far off country to fight. The review by the swede is therefore correct, BOB is just another american war movie. Too the person who said that critics of this movie should get their facts right: The Panther and Tiger tanks were ww2's best tanks, tank for tank, and their crews were superior to anything that the allies could muster. You claim that the T series was the best tank, the problem is that all russian tanks have T in their name. It ranges from the T-26 tanks to todays T-90. I put the blame on this lack of knowledge on your part to the american school system which doesnt learn american children anything about the world outside the US.The movie is good for one thing namely glorification of the soldiers who took part in it. In most cases this is well earned but in some cases for example concerning Lt. Speirs it is simply shamefull. Only in america could a war criminal like this be hailed as a war hero. There are also a lot of triggerhappy americans and in this case the movie depicts the realities of american troops in war very accurate. A european quote from ww2 sums everything up:""When the British planes attacked, the Germans took cover. When the German planes attacked, the Allies took cover. When the American planes attacked everyone took cover...""If you like movies depicting the realities of war without american ""mush"" and patriotism a movie like ""Talvisota"" or ""Stalingrad"" would be better.

If you don't cry while watching these, you were either sleeping, or have the emotional intelligence of an inanimate object.  ""Band of Brothers"" (so named from a famous line in Shakespeare's play ""Henry V"") depicts the 101st Airborne - Easy Company's journey in WWII from Training, through D-Day, through Bastonge, all the way to the Eagle's Nest (Adolf's private house).  It follows individual soldiers, and is extremely accurate.  These are real people, not made up characters, which makes it even more amazing.  The ONLY criticism I have, is that the Orig. series which aired on HBO, had the people's names during the short introductory interviews at the beginning of every episode.  It was easier to follow the emotions when you knew which soldier was talking.  Other than that one minor criticism, this is fabulous ""TV"".

Grueling at times and light as a feather at others, this miniseries will run you through the ringer of emotions and you'll leave feeling a stronger person so involved in the trials and tribulations of Easy Company that you'll feel you're actually an intimate part of this band of brothers - they will enter your consciousness and stick with you.

The best in my opinion is ""The World at War"" narrated by Laurence Olivier and done in the early 1970s.This dramatization by HBO is fair in my estimation. Unfortunately, the script seems to have been written by someone who never got over being a foul-mouthed adolescent. I don't care how much some may say that soldiers talked crudely and this is reality - I object to being presented with a made up script where the F word dominates much of the dialogue. Furthermore, there is one scene in Part 9 that is nothing but pornography. It was totally unnecessary and added nothing to the story. It didn't need to be there. I strongly object to HBO and other amoral movie makers producing this type of crap. The so called ""documentary"" could have been so much better with a more responsible script writer."	1.0	Rating	2012-08-10	60	5	55

The HD version is even better, with stunning cinematography and amazing sound. The series is so good, I actually find myself watching it every once in a while on television when it comes on around Memorial Day or Veterans Day. The series follows Easy Company from boot camp to the very end of the war. The scenes featuring the actual soldiers talking about their experiences really help you feel for all those guys. I've seen a lot of war movies, but Band of Brothers is unlike any other I have seen as far as quality and depth.Bottom Line: Anyone who enjoys military history or war movies will absolutely love Band of Brothers, and we can all learn some lessons of honor and integrity from these brave soldiers that the story is based on.	5.0	Excellent War Series with Stunning Cinematography	2009-09-06	0	0	0

Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg gave us a stirring elaboration on what was begun with ""Saving Private Ryan."" I feel that what makes any war movie worth its weight is the ability to transport the audience into the meatgrinder of combat. ""Band of Brothers"" does more than that. The mini-series format allows us to see ALL human dimensions surrounding war:...To see more, I highly recommend watching this dvd set. The most poignant parts of the series are the comments and recollectionsof the real heroes of Easy Company. In our post-September 11thworld, we needed a reaffirmation of what it means to be a hero.This series gave that to me.

I think it is now my alltime favorite war film. I can't see one thing I would have changed about this fine film. The performances were totally engrossing and the intense and varied action was so engaging; also suspenseful. One truly felt the chaois present in a battle and the subsequent 'thoughtful' moments were just stunning...they stopped me in dead my tracks and I still think and ponder on those profound and poignant moments in the film. Attention to detail was wonderful. Some key moments I don't want to reveal here, because I think this would spoil the film for others. I borrowed this fine set from a friend and so far, within a two month period, I have watched the entire production (including extras) three times. I could easily watch it again many times over. Everytime I watched it, I felt more involved and more understanding and appreciative of the individual men who fought, against all odds, for our freedom. I was totally engaged with the characters and got to know them even better than my first viewing, by my third. I am eternally grateful to all of these brave men, ones that lived to tell the story and ones who died in battle. Survivors suffered much and they had great fortitude. I would like to thank them all personally...everyone one of them were heros! Richard Winters, in real life, was much too modest, (in the documentary) when he said he was not a hero, to his grandson, but rather he served with a company of heros. He was exempletory in his leadership skills; he cared about his men and he no doubt, saved countless lives by his wise judgement. Damien Lewis did a fine job playing Dick Winters. The entire cast was well chosen and very believable as the characters they portrayed; all performances were extraordinary. I can't say enough about this film. It is well worth owning. The set is beautiful and very well done. It's well worth the investment. Beautiful score as well. I heard the lyrics to the main theme recently and they are wonderful as well....very uplifting.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3CSBYFVY4PHZD	Jason	"They were ordinary men, swept up in the most extraordinary conflict in history. But with the eyes of the world upon them, they found their greatest source of strength in each other. Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and HBO present the story of Easy Company, an elite team of U.S. paratroopers whose World War II exploits are as incredible as they are true. This landmark ten-part miniseries based on Stephen E. Ambrose's non-fiction best-seller recounts the remarkable achievements of a volunteer rifle company that parachuted into France on D-Day, spearheaded the Market-Garden and Rhine offensives, fought the Nazis in Bastogne and the Bulge and captured Hitler's ""impenetrable"" Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden in 1945. The ensemble cast includes Kirk Acevedo (HBO's Oz), David Schwimmer (TV's Friends), Jimmy Fallon (TV's Saturday Night Live), Colin Hanks (TV's Roswell), Damian Lewis (Hearts and Bones), Neal McDonough (Star Trek: First Contact), Donnie Wahlberg (The Sixth Sense) and Ron Livingston (Swingers). The series captures what it was like for these brave young men to be in WWII, in some of the most important battles in history. The men of Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st ""Screaming Eagles"" Airborne Division, U.S. Army had no easy tasks, but when asked, they came running. These men werent your average men in the military, they were put through the worst possible training, took the worst missions, including taking ""The Battle of the Buldge"", which was a horrifying battle, to say the least. These men when asked why they went to war, they simply replied ""Its just what had to be done"". Finally the Mini-Series event makes its way to DVD in a great little package. The 6-Disc DVD Box Set has all 10 Episodes of the series in anamorphic widescreen, Documentary We Stand Alone Together that lasts 1 hour and 20 minutes, The Making of Band of Brothers which lasts another 30 minutes and Video Diaries (Ron Livingston) The Making of the Film Through the Eyes of an Actor which lasts 1 hour. I will own this set the day it comes out, and for ninty bucks I think anyone who has seen the series will. This set will not be for rent, so I suggest you buy it the day it comes out, or the price will be jacked up and probably be right at one hundred and fifty bucks. For everyone who has seen the series its needless to say that if you miss this deal, you might miss Band of Brothers. Because you never know when the Box Set might go out of print."	5.0	Easy Company Finds Its Way On DVD!	2002-08-15	16	12	4

While it does a great job of showing us what war is like, it also does a great job of letting us know the people involved in the war.It's a realistic and accurate depiction, which means it can get extremly bloody at times (and tense).  The acting is top notch, the special effects are excellent (but not over the top) and the scenery is just amazing.If you like Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the Gate you'll love this.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A22TFAQ2GHTZH2	Jason Steel	Wow!  This is the best, most accurate representation of WWII I've ever seen.  I had already read the book by Stephen Ambrose and I thought it was the best book I had ever read.  It really showed how horrible war was and made you appreciate what these men did.  Then I heard that the miniseries was being released on dvd and video.  I knew I had to have it.  Well, it simply put, is the best thing I've ever watched.  The soldiers emotions are conveyed so well in this movie.  The struggles these men overcome are amazing.  This movie/miniseries is also very sad.  I don't know how the men of Easy Company handled this in real life because it is very difficult to come to grips with even in the movie/miniseries.  You must buy this if you have any interest in war and the like.  The combat in this movie is right in step with the book and it's really amazing as most movies have to cut corners when doing a movie/miniseries on a book.  Congratulations Mr. spielburg and Mr. Hanks, you've got a real winner on your hands with band of brothers	5.0	wow!	2002-12-31	3	3	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A37GN57SIHEQMD	Jason Woodside	Based on what friends had told me, I had high hopes for Band of Brothers. What I experienced when I watched it though was like nothing I would have imagined. You were with them, with EZ Company, every episode. The stories of the different men, and the different battles, got right into you. Most amazing was the fact that every account was true. Not based on a true story, but true.My Grandpa, although not Airborne, fought behind enemy lines in WWII. Unfortunately, he passed away when I was very young, but one story about him has always stuck with me. He was having a nightmare one night, and my aunt, who was a child at the time, woke him up. He jumped, and grabbed her, not knowing where he was. After a second, he realized where he was, and what was going on. He told my aunt, &quot;Sweetie, never wake me up like that. I am fighting the war every time I close my eyes.&quot; Band of Brothers, and in particularly, the Battle of Bastogne, finally brought home the horrors he must have faced. That many young men, who are now our Grandfathers, and Great-Grandfathers, must have faced.I believe that Stephen E. Ambrose, may he rest in peace, did the world a true favor in writing the story of these brave, young heroes, and I believe that Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks should be praised for bringing that story to so many homes. I highly recommend this series to anyone.	5.0	Absolutely amazing	2003-07-18	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2B3STNWXGP4Y5	Jay Autocross 43	This miniseries based on Steven Ambrose's book of the same name is probably the best portrayal of small unit action in WWII ever created. The lengthy miniseries format allows full character development and the chronology from harsh airborne training in the US to further training in England and then from D-Day through to Hitler's Eagle's Nest. It was a rare unit that saw that level of action and both the book and this miniseries are national treasures.In this year of the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, there are very few left who lived through that era.

And even if you're not a war buff you'll love the story telling.  As far as the fighting goes they don't pull punches, its more than graphic ....... its dalton trumbo graphic ....... different war, but you get the point.  It really brings to light the sacrifices these guys made for the rest of us.  I was so happy to see the ones who made it in Austria.  One of my favorite episodes, even thought there's very little action at that point.  When they took the 'Eagle's Nest' I admit I was grinning.  This is really a film.

Thank you so much Amazon Prime for making this available.  What can I say?  The HD video quality was excellent, the show itself was superb and the ability to binge watch it was icing on the cake.  The amazing thing is how many of the supporting or background players in this show have since become top drawer names - Michael Fassbender, Tom Hardy, James McAvoy, etc.  My only quibble with the series is that the music could've been better.  I'm just not a fan of heavenly strings and angelic choirs for gritty wartime dramas, and also, maybe the binge watching made the music too annoyingly repetitious.  Anyway, great stuff.

It would have been one thing if there was a flash back during the movie that had film grain, but the entire dang series? Artistic style? Whatever. Human beings do not see with film grain. I'm positive that even 60 years ago, Humans eyes did not add film grain to what they saw.

I even aplauded the use of David Schwimmer, who I find to be one of the worst actors in all Hollywood, a superior choice in the role of Capt. Herbert Sobel.If one is to invest in DVD as a collectible item then this is one that belongs in every collection.

Pouliot	What can you say about one of the most definitive depictions of World War II's European theater to be found anywhere?Drop $90, soldier, and buy it!Band of Brothers is a must-own set of DVDs that is eminently watchable and re-watchable. In a brilliant adaptation of Stephen Ambrose's book, we follow the exploits of the 101st Airborne Division's Easy Company from training, through D-Day and until the end of the war. The writing, direction, special effects and acting are all first rate, giving the viewer a battalion-full of real characters to identify with.The series honors the ordinary heroics of the soldiers it depicts without romanticizing them. It honestly depicts the horror, terror, suffering and randomness of war. The camera work puts you right in the action, and the dialog is realistic and unromantic. You can practically smell the sweat, terror and resignation.Critics who complain that we don't get to know the men of the company miss the point; in war (unlike the movies) you don't get to keep your favorite buddies until a propitious pause in the action. The DVD shows how even these minor characters were well-limned and authentic.The special feature of the making of the series was also fascinating, showing how some of the film's special effects were accomplished.

First I have to say that I am a WWII buff and have recently visited Normandy (including Ste-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise and Br&eacute;court Manor) and the extermination camp in Auschwitz, Poland. Most of the WWII films made to this day are cheesy and while they are meant to explore and show what happened during the war, the bad acting (e.g. The Longest Day) and lack of financial means these movies generally suffer from cannot possibly render justice to the WWII history. Enter Band of Brothers. It must be said that Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg had ZERO financial interest in the making of this series (unlike Saving Private Ryan) and truly wanted to portray these events as faithfully as possible just for the sake of educating the viewing public. The veterans who have seen the series and are part of it have all approved it (except for a couple of events that didn't necessarily involve the 101st but still took place), I myself have spoken with many specialists who confirm the authenticity of the storyline, and it is easy to verify these events and how they happened just by surfing the web and reading a few books. Finally, a WWII reference piece! I have to wonder what would motivate anyone to qualify this masterpiece as abysmal filmmaking. Indeed, Band of Brothers is the finest WWII ""commercial"" film ever made."	5.0	"The best ""commercial"" WWII story put on film"	2008-12-30	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2QR8I0OORKP23	Jeanne Coppage	This series about Easy-Company during World War II is one of the best I have ever seen.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AOJA1LC8PN7K1	Jeff Chambers	This is a phenomenal WWII series, brilliantly written, produced, directed, and acted.  The music scores are also exceptional.  No matter how many times I watch the series, it's hard to digest and comprehend the brutality and pain of war.  There are triumphs too.  And this series puts you right there, making it easy to forget that you're sitting in a safe environment, not in a hellish war zone.  The series vividly depicts the bravery and sacrifice of WWII - and you'll learn (or renew) your appreciation for the men and women who fought for our freedom.  Anything more that I write in this review will only reiterate the countless positive reviews and ratings here on Amazon.  I originally purchased the DVD version a few years ago and immediately purchased the Blu-Ray version when it was released.  The Blu-Ray version is much better than expected.  Visuals and audio are excellent.  Start-up time is fast, and there are no aggravating previews or other advertising junk on the discs.  These are truly a timeless Blu-Ray collection.	5.0	Brilliant & Timeless Series about WWII	2009-06-12	2	2	0

I have never watched TV this long in one day before but I watched the entire series (I believe it is 11 1/2 hours long) on ONE SUNDAY. Went to work tired the next day because I didn't finish until midnight.When you see the actual men that were portrayed in the movie at the end it really strikes home.I asked my son who has his own place if he wanted to watch it after I described it to him. He had already heard a great deal about it. After a month I asked him why he hadn't watched it yet. He and his friends are waiting until they also can devote an entire day to it - not my idea - their own.I decided to let him keep it and get myself another copy. When I saw that Amazon had the Blu-Ray version for the same price that I paid for the DVD copy I ordered it right away.Hmmm.... Maybe this Sunday.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1TCXQ0Z0Z0QRT	J. E. George	"First , let me say that I watched the original HBO series when it first aired in 2001. It began just after 9/11 and was especially gripping, partly due to the ""mood"" of the nation and the fear of what lay on the horizon. I became totally absorbed by the series and never missed an episode. When it was finally released on DVD, I gladly ran to the store and paid $120 for the set, and enjoyed it all over again.When the Bluray was announced, I deliberated about the value of investing in the upgraded version. Most of the scenes are intentionally gritty, and all battle scenes have a choppy, grainy, scratched-film effect to them. I decided to rent the Bluray from Netflix, to see if it was worth the difference.WOW! I never would have believed that Bluray sharpness and clarity could add so much to a film shot with so many intentional shortcomings. I'm now on disc 2, and the set has been added to the top of my Christmas wish list, highest priority.One thing I noticed immediately, the increased detail adds more emotional contrast between the battle scenes and the shots of the calm, beautiful landscapes and villages. Also, the facial expressions are also more intense. Finally, the horror of war is even more gruesome. It's like seeing the movie for the first time, all over again. To me, that is the true mark of a great Bluray. Enjoy, I will. I'll wait and review the audio after I receive my 5.1 headphones..."	5.0	Was skeptical about the bluray difference...	2008-12-06	18	15	3

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1KPIYF5SNMZJU	Jennifer	Although Ian might think war is horrible and evil, it sometimes is needed. What are Holy Wars for? Man kind isn't perfect. Yes, it would be easy if everyone just sat down and said, &quot;I'm never going to start war again,&quot; but it's never going to happen. Don't live in your, &quot;everything should be perfect,&quot; world because it's never going to happen. You're going to have people hating each other because of religion, land, and jealousy. It's man's nature. I bet even now you have a sort of &quot;war&quot; going on when you fight or yell at someone. You contradict yourself.In those times of dispute you need people willing to go out and say, &quot;hey, I will get myself killed if it saves 1,000 lives somewhere now and in the future.&quot; And having an uncle in WW2, this movie made me even more proud of him. I would find myself bragging that my uncle fought to save lives, even if he had to take some in the process, and after this miniseries I found myself even prouder. This movie makes you proud of them because you see what they have to put behind them to do. When I watched the scene with Maj. Winters running onto a hill only to see a young boy kneeling in the grass and he hesitates to shoot him, you come to realize this is something these men will never forget. They realize what they're doing, but they do it because it's their duty.This was an amazingly well done miniseries. I was so proud of it. I remember before it came out on HBO I would count down the days waiting for it to come on. Then when it did I would record it every week because I had school the next morning and couldn't stay up late. So I'd get home on Monday and sit down and watch it. There's nothing to explain the feelings you get when you're watching this. It's like you're actually living through it.And it was actually nice to see a war documentary type movie that didn't have a love story written in. I can't tell you how much I loved this mini series.I'm 18 and can respect a movie like that. It's more than just about heroes and winning, it's an insight on the horrors of war that you've only heard about.Who could foget the poor guy who died yelling, &quot;I don't want to die,&quot; over and over again?Not to mention the music composed by Michael Kamen is beautiful.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AYMALNASAQAHW	Jerry G. Ennenga	"This DVD set is one of the best additions to my video library I have ever made. It is an instant classic because it is the true story of the men of Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division in WWII Europe. It is also a classic because of the quality way it is made with attention to the minutest detail. In the foreword to the latest edition of the book this series is based on, Stephen E. Ambrose tells of how Hanks and Spielberg got started on this video project. He also tells of their genuine interest in telling the story of the ""Band of Brothers"" exactly like it happened. These efforts included face-to-face and phone conversations with the surviving members of Easy to ensure they recreated every scene correct, even down to what each man was feeling. Ambrose told the true story of these heroes in his book, and the video series follows the book to the letter.Although I have never experienced hard combat such as that of the battle of Bastogne, I did spend many years in the U.S. Navy. During that time, I learned first hand the value of effective leadership and of the camaraderie that makes a military unit a ""Band of Brothers"". This series shows that leadership and camaraderie in an excellent manner.This exceptional video production tells the whole story of the heroes of Easy Company from their formation and training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia to their deactivation at the conclusion of WWII. It portrays their thoughts, feelings and actions during such key WWII campaigns as the D-Day landings, Operation Market Garden in Holland, the Battle of the Bulge, the fall of Nazi Germany and the occupation of Hitler's Eagles Nest in the Alps.This DVD set is a must-have addition to any video library, especially if you are interested in American history, WWII, effective leadership or just inspiring stories. I even recommend it to anti-war advocates as it accurately depicts the true horrors of war. As any intelligent person knows, combat warriors are the strongest anti-war advocates there are, as politicians and diplomats start the wars; it is the warriors who have to put their butts on the line to prosecute and win them. I cannot recommend owning this set strongly enough!"	5.0	An Instant Classic	2008-06-23	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AUF4NPBMOU0JQ	Jerry Yamamuro	This is one amazing DVD set. I saw parts of it on HBO during its initial showing and was highly impressed with the episodes I saw. The realism of the battle sequences appears to be on the order of Saving Private Ryan. The script dialogue and acting are very well done in an understated way. The visual impact does not need further embellishment. This is a great war production, but it does not spend its time glorifying or denouncing war. The characters all felt WWII was necessary, but absolutely horrendous on the participants of both sides.The different episodes focus on different aspects and characters in chronological order. I really liked the ensemble cast. None, except David Schwimmer, is really well known, but almost all were able to develop their characters in a meaningful way during the the duration of the 10 episodes. Different episodes tended to feature different cast members. The soundtrack was well done, too. The excerpts from interviews of the actual people was very touching and helped to emphasize that the production did not stray from the truth too much. It certainly is a landmark production and will be difficult to beat in the future. With all the trash that is being constantly produced it is amazing that this was made. I guess that having Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg producing it made a big difference.	5.0	Superior production	2002-11-11	2	2	0

I think it is better than any other war movie or series that I have seen because it focuses on a variety of characters.  It isn't just one or two main people.  Everyone's flaws and fears and pain is so real.  It's long, but you can't stop once you start.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3AQL35A6BSCL3	jgslima	"This review is specific to Blu Ray version, I and assume you already know the miniseries.The image is not perfect, due to 2 points: much grain and a little DNR (Digital Noise Reduction). The latter one makes some skin and clothing textures seem a little dull sometimes.The grain: there are people who don't care about it, but I don't like it. And I find hard to agree that, in Band of Brothers case, the grain is part the source and so should be there, because in the DVD version I can't see grain. That disappointed me.On the other hand, Band of Brothers blu ray edition has what may be the coolest bonus I've ever seen. The ""In the Field with the Men of Easy Company"" interactive guide is great, with notes, real videos and explanations about army which are real interesting for those who like to learn more about World War II and army in general.In fact, these bonus make you see the show with even more respect than before, once you see that every detail in the script was in fact real, and the show seems to be more like a documentary then a movie."	4.0	Specific Blu Ray review: not perfect image, good bonus	2009-05-17	7	5	2

This put him in another light, and I hope he does more &#34;Non-Friends&#34; characters.

We loved the musical score on the introduction.  Almost had to stop just to soak it in w/the still photos.  We watched each episode with deeper respect for what our military go through to fight for lives and freedom.  The dialogue for the interviews was hard to hear and for whatever reason, we had the volume up throughout the movie.  We're glad we got to watch it again.  Sometimes, a bit too realistic.  In one episode they are asking why are they fighting and then find out why.  Atrocities no one knew existed.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3FFW39219ZAKC	jjhammer	This is by far one of my favorite shows of all time. I love the history behind World War II and this doesn't disappoint. While it's predecessor &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; focuses specifically on D-Day (which will have it's 70th anniversary on June 6, 2014), this looks at the war in Europe from the American perspective. You really feel like you are a part of what Easy Company goes through. This follows the group from D-Day through the Battle of the Bulge and finally to the German surrender. This was also a big boost to some of the actors careers, especially Damian Lewis (now of Homeland fame). You will see some cameos, like Jimmy Fallon, but for the most part it is the same group. You don't have to be a history buff or military fan to enjoy this. Probably best for teenagers and up. While there is a lot of language, there are very few scenes involving nudity or sex.	5.0	Not even funny how good this show is	2014-05-29	1	1	0

Now I would do the same for BOB with much more enthusiasm.More than just a war movie, this film demonstrates how ordinary people set out to do some extraordinary things, even in the most onimous conditions. It's a celebration of humanity in general. The production is excellent, it has the same 40% reduction in color saturation as SPR, and same ggod sound quality, which added to the experience tremendously. Surprisingly, the performance were also great across the board with these no-name actors, I envision some of them future movie stars. Oh, even without a single actress in this film, all of my female friends loved it.Garbages like ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Windtalkers"" completely destroyed those film-worth materials, that just churns my stomach.

If you're a person who's not too keen on reading about history - but who likes movies or documentaries about it, this is a series of DVDs for you. It traces the involvement of Easy Company during the entire course of WWII - bootcamp, staging in England, D-Day, their campaigns they fought in.In doing so, there is not one single weak performance given by the sterling cast of 1st Line, 2nd Line and character actors. Gritty, unflinching, and dogged in its portrayal of the WWII experience by American GI's, this series loses the sugarcoating found in many war movies. There's no romanticism here.If you want to understand why so many WWII veterans hate war in any form but the absolute most necessary form, watch these images and try to feel what these simple, ordinary American men felt.At the end, you may have a slightly different take on Veteran's Day.	5.0	Tracing the complete arc	2007-05-23	1	1	0

It could have gone Hollywood, instead it stays true to Ambrose's glorious prose.  It is steady, solid and utterly, totally overwhelming in its scope, sensitivity and completeness.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3NKFB39AIEN8W	J. O. Booker	The first time I saw this series was shortly after Private Ryan had completed its run in the theaters. Tom Hanks was great in that one and hearing that he and the great Spielberg were involved in this series got me to check it out though my expectations were realistic; nothing could top Ryan, I thought--I was wrong. Even if you don't particularly care for war movies, please check out this series. I promise that five minutes into the first episode you'll be glad you did.Brothers follows a unit called Easy Company from boot camp, throughout various skirmishes in the German theater, to the Jewish labor camps, and finally victory and German surrender. The trip from point A to B is oftentimes heroic, sad, and harrowing. What I like about this series over Private Ryan is that even though there are quite a few characters, you spend enough time with them to get to know them, and care for them, and admire them. Like Sergeant Spears' character, my favorite character in the series. Or Lieutenant Winters.Each series begins with surviving members of Easy Company giving his account of the campaign depicted in the ensuing episode. If I were to sum up the theme of this series with its many twists and turns it's about how adversities turn men into brothers and how that adversity can often bring out the best and worst in men. Truly unbelievable series. So many memorable scenes in this film. One of the most ghoulish and convincing scenes is the one where they discover the labor camp. The episode is called Why We Fight and I promise you it will affect you, the depth of cruelty and barbarism man is capable of inflicting on another man. My favorite episode is the third one.But it's not all drama. There's more than enough good ol' American kick-*ss action in here. Looking at this series it's hard to believe that all of this stuff actually happened. Those were some bad dudes. And that this series was made at all is a miracle in this era of style over substance. No big name actors are in this series, some of them may be famous now, but back when this series came out on HBO they still had milk on their breaths. This adds realism and makes it easier to care for them in the situations they find themselves in. This is the granddaddy of all war epics imo and not to be missed. Great way to pay tribute to our veterans and to remember the sacrifices they made for this country.	5.0	Can it get any better than this?	2012-03-01	1	1	0

At the beginning of each episode when they interview real heros and hearing in their own words about their war experience, makes you feel their pain, the shake of every bomb blast, and the sound and movement of every bullet piercing or passing bye.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A29PCQFO8JCYL3	Joe Vanderbilt	I only caught glimpses of this movie when it was actually on HBO, and rare glimpses at that.  I was avoiding it because I thought it be riddled with sappy melodrama and cliche'd characters, pitfalls (to me) of some of Spielberg's movies.  Boy was I wrong.I was browsing through the DVD selections and thought I'd give this one a try, finally: the neat metal case caught my eye and I've a penchant for watching war movies anyway.  The case had Tom Hanks name on it, so I thought maybe there's a chance that Tom held the reins on Spielberg to keep him from going overboard with the drama.I watched it over a period of two days, unable to stop watching on the first day until sleep finally began to overtake me at about 2:00am.  I watched the first 3 DVDs without a stop that day, the next two the following day.  If I could've stayed awake to watch all of them at one sitting I surely would have.  It was that good.  Even though I just finished watching it yesterday, I'm already thinking about watching the whole thing again.What I like about this series would be too long to put into words here.  Just know that it is consistently excellent throughout its 10-hour span.  The acting is top-notch with no overacting or melodrama, the direction keeps everything in line and focused, and even though it's a movie with Spielberg's name on it, special effects are NOT the driving force of this movie.What IS the driving force are the men of Easy Company, the situations they faced, and how they worked as a team to survive and move ahead.Not to be left out of the credits are the brutal battle sequences.  Think of the opening of Saving Private Ryan... times 10, filmed at the same high shutter speed that captures all the detail.  Something that also caught my eye were all the hand signals they used to talk to one another when silence was key.  Incredible.Also, the DVD picture quality itself is superb to say the least.  I have a 73&quot; HDTV and DVDs lacking in quality look terrible on it.  This is not the case with Band of Brothers.  My DVD player said the DVD plays back at a bitrate of about 7-8Mbit/s, twice the 3.5-4Mbit/s of the average DVD.  As a result, mpeg artifacts are seen very, very rarely.	5.0	Excellent movie, excellent quality	2003-01-26	13	13	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AWZB8NKK0827B	"""johann575"""	Without being redundant, I too thought this was a great series, perhaps the overall best depiction of WW2 that's ever been filmed.  Of course, in a 10 hour mini-series, the producers and directors have the opportunity ot go into much more detail in terms of character development and to be more faithful to the book than in a 2 or 3 hour movie, which makes this production a must have for war/history buffs.The length of this production gives the viewer a much better feel for the boredom/terror of war, and a better feeling of what is was really like to be in the 101st.  Two of the latter episodes (7 and 9 I think) were particularly good, and although just as important to the telling of the whole story, I could have done with less time spent on the training in episode 1.  It took me two viewings to really be clear on who was who, since of course they all have uniforms and sometimes it was difficult to remember the specific soldiers.  However, I suppose that is how it really was, especially when the replacements started arriving.This is the kind of DVD I will watch many times, and since Ambrose was a actively involved in the production, it is true to the book.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3J8LA7GTESD3O	John Black	I could give a five star but the time for telling such a intense story was cut too short for the series time frames. I was impressed by the proper equipment and dress of the characters where most often it is not so accurate. The story of these men and so many others who served together with so little comforts is always worth watching to recall how much so many gave for our future. It follows the men of &#34;Easy Company&#34; as they go from basic jump training to the end of World War Two and gives personal details often missed in many documentaries. The story was cut short in many aspects to cover a long time span I am sure due to production time limits. Reading the book is highly recommended either before or after viewing the series as it tells more detail that is aided by the series to tell a &#34;Tale of Men&#34; who went through so much together and the bonding impact of such intense minutes in their lives and the visual aspects.A four and one half star would be a better rating as it will be one of the more defining stories of World War Two that will be a must watch for generations. On Memorial Day my son sat with his eight year old daughter and viewed some of the movies/documentaries showing on TV and shared some of the story of her Great Grandfather (my father) and how much he and men like him suffered through to ensure the hope of freedom for future generations. My son knows little about my service during the Vietnam era in the USAF but one day I hope he asks questions where I can try to explain things to him. All Military Personal have had experiences that should be shared and told to family and friends to help us all understand the sacrifice's made to give a better world for our future generations.The sharing of the experiences of the men of &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; is what makes it a story that will serve to help remind us of the effects of war upon us past, present and future.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A4RHSAD430LDV	John Carr	This is an absolute must watch series and this is coming from a person who never had any interest in anything dealing with war. This might come as a surprise considering that I serve in the U.S. military, but never took the time to honor those that served before me...up until now.WWII is an almost forgotten part of U.S. history that the younger generation doesn't seem to appreciate. The same could have been said about me (and I'm 34), but thanks to this well made series, it has opened my eyes to why we enjoy the freedom that we so much take for granted today.Band of Brothers is an enjoyable history lesson at the expense of retelling the tragic events of WWII as seen through the eyes of real men, who put their lives on the line for a common good. It's amazing how the series progresses with such realism as if you were in the middle of the action. Many times I would get goosebumbs and found myself shaking my head in disbelief knowning that these guys were all real courageous volunteers, who could have backed out of a redicoulousy difficult boot camp, but refused so that they could go to war and fight the enemy. These are the real heroes that you don't come across very often these days.The blue-ray disc offers some great visuals, but has a grainy washed out look that fits the atmosphere of war, so don't expect a crystal clear picure. The BR set also has commentary by some of the remaining survivors, that makes the series worth watching again, as they offer a haunting retelling of what when on during the time-line. It's also notable that at least one of the members pasted away in recent years, which makes hearing their interviews that much more special.So to sum up...it's a great history lesson, on a well made film, put together in a great looking package, with nice bonuses. It make this Airman here that much more proud when I put on my uniform every morning and makes me even more proud of my son who is now in Army boot camp training to me an Airborne Ranger. I plan on sending him this video set when he completes his training, so that he can also value the importance of U.S. military history.	5.0	An entertaining, humorous, and grim history lesson	2008-12-10	1	1	0

We can see, too, how tenuous victories really are, the ebb and flow of battles, the sacrifices of the soldiers, the occasional incompetence of leaders, the special bravery of Army medics, and so much more.And, for those of us who served in the 101st--not in those valiant times but years later--it reminds us of the honor we have had to have been a part of that division.Each time that I drive near Currahee Mountain, I have always known and remembered its history.	5.0	A tribute to the 101st	2014-06-15	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2QF8GI2YDC94C	John H Wood	Band of Brothers is one of the very best depictions of WW II and the horrors that our soldiers had to try to contend with. The characters are based on real people who fought in the battles that the movie shows..They were extremely well portrayed by each of the actors. The writing, the directing, and producing was excellent. However, it is indeed a very disturbing movie, filled with incredible action and at times a great deal of realistic gore. These brave men, as well as countless others who fought in other engagements throughout the European campaign, are truly unselfish heroes. Each new segment is begun with a short account given by the true-life individuals who are some of the main characters in each episode.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A384TMGOZLDYN1	"John ""John"""	"Simple Review: I'm not going to bother commenting on how spectacular this series is, but it's amazing. I'm more writing to comment on the exceptional quality of the blu-ray edition of 'Band of Brothers'. For anyone wondering if it's worth purchasing on blu-ray, the answer is a definitive ""YES!!"". The transfer is astounding; they've given the 5 star treatment to this beloved series. I noticed that some reviews are saying that this isn't true, that the colors bleed or the blacks don't hold up. All I have to say is that you either have a cheap television, your blu-ray disc, or player, is defective for some reason, or you have no idea how to properly calibrate your HDTV (this is probably the case). I own a 58"" Panasonic Viera Plasma HD TV (properly calibrated) and the transfer is absolutely amazing. If you own a great quality HD TV (preferably an amazing new Plasma rather than a LCD), that's properly calibrated, then you should love watching this series on blu-ray. LCD HD TVs will give you crappy motion-blur and doesn't show you films in the form they were originally meant to be seen in. So for the few people that are saying these are poor quality discs, you have no idea what you're talking about. This is a must have for blu-ray owners. And if you're going to drop money on an HD TV, then take time to do your research and find the ones that have the best picture quality, that show films the way they were meant to be seen, then learn how to properly calibrate your t.v. or find someone else that knows how to do it for you. Only then will you be able to truly enjoy the added benefits to owning films and television series on blu-ray.... especially ones such as 'Band of Brothers'. This is one of the best looking blu-ray sets I've seen thus far."	5.0	Band of Brothers (Blu-ray) - AMAZING!!! A must own!!	2010-12-29	2	1	1

I worked with a man who landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day and when WWII was over,a little more then a year later, he was one of three survivors that was left of his platoon. My father was a veteran of WWII who pasted away in 2012 at the age of 89. Soon there will be none left of the Greatest Generation.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A20IGRAOVHFPXZ	John O. Koehler	The German Cold War Infantry Officer's review of April 27, 2003, writes a good review most of which I agree. but unfortunately, he speaks about the German soldiers' families being &quot;murdered by American phosphorus bombs&quot; while he ignores the air raids on Britain that killed innocents as well. Worse, he regurtitates the falsehood that US fighter aircraft strafed women and children after the raids on Dresden. This never happened! I was a 14-year-old runner for Dresden Air Raid Police(Luftschutzpolizei)whose story was chronicled in John Toland's book &quot;The Last Hundred Days&quot;. Both night raids of 13/14February, 1945, by the RAF bombers were NOT accompanied by US fighters. The British flew quite low over the city and oncecould hear the roar of the engines quite clearly. In the earlymorning hours of the 14th, I was at the banks of the Elbe river where many hundreds had sought refuge. I saw no evidence of anyinjuries of deaths because of strafing. Stories that this infact had occurred began the fowlling day. I spoke to many whowhere at river and no one confirmed this. There was NO strafingduring the US daylight raids on the 14th. However,weeks later,US Mustangs did strafe along the river, hitting barges carrying troops and supplies, absolutely military targets.	5.0	Setting it straight	2003-05-28	8	7	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A14IM9LEBAM76L	"John P. Ozols ""JPOZ"""	"I would have never thought I would be compelled to write a review for any movie at a website.  This mini-series ""Band of Brothers"" moved me in such a profound way that I feel the need to express my gratitude to the filmmakers who brought this extraordinary masterpiece to television and DVD.  Please, do yourself a service and buy/watch this DVD and have an experience.  But, it's not for the faint of heart.The story follows the story of a group of soldiers (Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division) from boot camp in Georgia to Hitler's mountain palace at Berchtesgaden during WWII.  The casualties are high.  The pain is real.  This is a true story that transcends being a mere film.  You feel like you were allowed to go back in time and witness history in the making on a human level.I was a television/film major in college, so I am familiar with filmmaking techniques.  ""Band of Brothers"" is perhaps the best war film ever made in this country (or anywhere) period.  It has the advantage of being a series - so it can go into depth like no 2-hour movie can.  The main characters can be fully developed and are.  The attention to detail is outstanding.  The filmmakers even created the series with a washed-out color quality like an old color photograph, which gives the viewer a psychological sense of the 1940's.You can feel the tension of the paratroopers approaching Normandy before the anti-aircraft fire.  You feel the panic to escape the aircraft before it is hit.  Many planes had to fly too low and too fast because of the clouds and the anti-aircraft fire.  The first-person camera shot of one soldier leaving the aircraft was very well done.An example of the wonderful attention to detail is a scene where the defeated German soldiers march down the middle of autobahn as the Americans drove into Germany.  That shot exactly matched a WWII photograph I saw in a history book.The acting is exceptional.  You really feel that you know these people personally after a couple of hours.  When somebody is wounded or dies, you feel the loss and the pain.  When Lt. Winters shoots a young German soldier at close range, his pain comes through.  You know he will be haunted by this image the rest of his life (he later sees the same face on a young Frenchman on the train in Paris).I am not going to presume that I could ever know how it feels to be in a foxhole freezing with enemy shells tearing down trees all around me, or the shear terror of rushing a village with friends falling all around me and bullets wheezing by my ears, but this is as close as a film can take me.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" was the only other war film that accomplished battle sights and sounds as real as ""Band of Brothers"".This is a true tribute to Easy Company and all who died and sacrificed for our freedom.  Every American should watch this series and the documentary at some time in their life.  WWII was a long time ago, but we should not be quick to forget the real people that suffered, fought and died.  Watch and learn.  I had many a night in deep thought after watching every part of ""Band of Brothers""."	5.0	Profoundly Moving	2004-06-03	11	10	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A18F8S6IKC7MAC	John W. Crockett	I've seen this series three times already.  Each time I watch it is more compelling that the last.  Regardless of what your views of any war are, this amazing and true story focuses on a &quot;band of brothers&quot;, a group of men who are lumped together as paratroopers in the US Army in WWII.This series does a great job of capturing the futility of war and the fragile nature of man, capitalizing on the ability of men to grow together and fourish despite overwhelming obstacles and a bleak and dismal life that comes in times of war.The casting in the movie was awesome.  Each actor captures the character he is portraying, including Donnie Wahlberg, who plays a very convincing 1SG (later 2LT) Lipton.  The same can be said for each of the actors, including David Schwimmer, who plays the part of an incompetent and much-hated company commander.The combat scenes couldn't have been better and are completely opposite of the kind of pyrotechnics and stage magic you'd see in an action film.  Instead, the series captures the fast-paced tempo of live combat along with the edge-of-your-seat feel that something bad could happen at any moment.I have to warn you now that this movie (very convincingly) glorifies the American soldier for his heroic actions and sacrifices in Europe during WWII (using documented factual events), so if you're one of those who think America can only do wrong, you'd better leave this one on the shelf and get something else...	5.0	Awesome depiction of human sacrifice by a band of brothers	2004-04-07	5	5	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1A39INEWTWRBE	Jonathan N. Klein	Band of Brothers is an incredibly realistic portrayal of WWII.  It is one of my favorite TV programs ever, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the genre.  This is a 10 hour series in the style of Saving Private Ryan, and it is worth every minute.  The show is definitely violent, and there is a substantial amount of blood, but it is always tasteful and never overdone.  Hanks and Spielberg give you a picture of the war that is exciting and interesting, while at the same time avoiding the tendency that many directors have to glorify it.  Easiest five stars I have ever given in a review.	5.0	One of my favorite TV programs	2008-01-01	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2YYE3SG93MD71	"Jorge H. Padilla Leal ""JorgeHP"""	"These extraordinary (yet excruciating, raw, violent and emotional) episodes capture in an incredible narrative the ups, downs, glory, horrors, trials and tribulations of common men becoming soldiers and enduring what has become known as the Last Great War.Like Saving Private Ryan before it, this Mini-Series tries to put you in the middle of the daily wear and tear of this war. But this time, not in a small unit to save one man, which can be viewed as an exception in the great scheme of the war, but as one more soldier in the middle of the ""great and noble undertaking"" that was World War II. Great and noble, yes, but also not an easy one as Eisenhower told the D-Day troops: ""Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle hardened, he will fight savagely.""Coincidentally or by Providence, the same dedicated people behind that Saving Private Ryan, fascinated by the accounts of these real-life soldiers (found on the book Band of Brothers by author Steven Ambrose), decided to spare no expense to bring this incredibly real, and incredibly raw in the human scale, story to life. Now in blu ray, this Mini-Series begin to get the respect it deserves. Though, in my humble opinion, this series should one day be presented in cinemas.There is definitely R-Rated material here. Children need not be exposed to the war in order to avoid it. But teens and youths sometimes do forget that their freedoms costs; so this is, I think, great material to see and explore together with parents and gives excellent chances to engage in fascinating and profound conversations about war, life, principle, and definitely, God with their kids. This particular Mini-Series, focuses on the day-to-day hardships that a man must endure in this life; some days are good, some are bad, some better, some worse, some simply extraordinary. Some things are worth fighting for, even dying for; but it is equally important to be clear on WHO, WHAT and WHY we are fighting or dying for.The Longest Day, Saving Private Ryan, many other great WWII films, and now this superlative Mini-Series in all the glory of High Definition.May all these help us NEVER forget that simple men are capable of accomplishing world-changing feats."	5.0	"""We few, we happy few, we band of brothers"""	2008-11-25	6	4	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2DSXA1E02C86D	Joseph Haschka	BAND OF BROTHERS is categorically the best TV miniseries ever created, surpassing my previous pick, LONESOME DOVE.This 10-hour/10-episode epic was a labor of love produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the latter the lead in perhaps the finest combat drama ever made for the Big Screen, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.Based on the non-fiction book by Stephan Ambrose, BAND OF BROTHERS is a visual tribute to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. Its timespan is a little more than 3 years, from the summer of 1942 to the late fall of 1945. It depicts the company's training in the United States and England, its combat roles in the D-Day invasion, the subsequent Operation Market Garden, and the defense of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, and ends with the capture of Hitler's Alpine retreat, Berchtesgaden, and the occupation of a scenic Austrian lake valley.There aren't enough superlatives to describe the acting, period costuming and weaponry, cinematography, and sets. It's a masterpiece of cinema verite. The actors are virtual unknowns. Perhaps this is inescapable in a script calling for the rapid turnover of personalities. Company E's full complement was 140 men - 8 officers and 132 enlisted. But, as casualties mounted, original members were replaced with new, and the cast of characters is large. The viewer never really gets to &quot;know&quot; any one soldier, with the exception of perhaps Dick Winters (Damian Lewis), who provides a continuity of sorts. Winters began as a 2nd Lieutenant commanding a platoon, and ended the war as a Major commanding the 2nd Battalion. To the degree that the storyline allows, Winters is the foremost hero in a group of heroes, i.e. all of E Company. The viewer is thus forced to identify with the unit as a whole throughout its travails and final triumph. And Lewis, a Brit who manages to lose his accent for the role, is perfect. Ron Livingston as Lewis Nixon, Winter's good friend and alcoholic but competent battalion staff officer, provides an additional thread of continuity from beginning to end.Those who've both read the book and seen the miniseries will notice differences. Some events are shown in a different sequence, as when one of the Company E troopers is killed by a freak accident with a souvenir Luger pistol. More noticeably, an entire episode is more or less devoted to the heroics of a company medic during the defense of Bastogne, while another focuses on the unit's discovery of a Nazi enslavement camp. Both subjects are given but scant paragraphs in the original book.The DVD also includes a bonus track on the nuts and bolts of the production. I watched this feature after the miniseries, and was amazed to learn that the forest setting for the defense of Bastogne episode, one of the best, was an indoor creation, snow and all!I saw the ten episodes over a couple of weeks. Perhaps a better way to do it is have all your male pals over for a one-day viewing marathon to include pizza and beer (or C-rations and canteen water in an olfactory ambience of gun oil, blood, stale sweat, exploded earth, and open latrine trenches). Oh, did I mention that this is a Guy Flick? It's about young males bonding, jumping out of airplanes, fighting, killing, getting maimed and killed, and enjoying the fruits of victory (booze, women and looting). There's no female role of significance, and no love interest. It's Warrior Life at its best and worst.	5.0	The platinum standard for a TV miniseries	2003-07-05	2	2	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A32QOYM6N2CXUV	Joseph L.	"What more can be said?  Band of Brothers brilliantly and beautifully explores loyalty, bravery, duty, loss, fear, and utmost devotion through highly-accurate true life accounts of Easy Company, 506 Parachute Infantry.  In just three years, from 1942 to 1945, during a war that shook the entire world, these young men lived an entire lifetime.  The actual events are almost unbelievable in their intensity and scope.  But ultimately this is not a war story; it is a story of the best of humanity.  Through their experiences they teach us not only how soldiers fight and survive in the most dire and difficult conditions, but how we can all live full, meaningful lives through commitment to cause and those closest to us -- especially during times of our own difficult circumstances.The writing and acting are absolutely superb throughout.  Relying mostly on a cast of unknowns (including many Brits with flawless American accents and mannerisms), we can truly ""believe"" the characters even as they are finally identified at the end of the series with the real veterans 55 years on.  Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, author Steven Ambrose and the veterans themselves ensure that we will never forget or fail to appreciate what they did -- especially the sacrifice of those who never came home to tell their story  or live out their lives.  Many have said this is the best made-for-TV production ever.  I agree.  With each viewing the power of these true stories increases."	5.0	Almost speechless...	2011-07-25	3	3	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AVR3F6VQYIMZW	Joseph Tidline	"When Band of Brothers was first announced by HBO I was very excited because Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg were both involved. I figured that since Hanks and Spielberg had both done a great job with Saving Private Ryan that this should be good as well. Well I was not prepared for how good this miniseries was. I was in front of the television every Sunday night to watch this masterpiece. I had never been much of a fan of films about World War II. In fact I am ashamed to say I didn't know that much about WWII except for what little I was taught in history class. I was fascinated with all of the experiences, both good and bad, these men went through. And what made this film even better was that these were real stories. These men really went through all this and so did many many more. And they did it for us. They did it for their country. These men grow and mature right before our eyes, going from young recruits to hardened battle scared soldiers. What I wasn't prepared for was the emotions this show would bring out in me. This film will make you laugh, make you angry, make you grow closer to the characters, and trust me on this one, it will make you cry. More than once I found myself crying because of the loss of someone I had grown attached to and knowing tha these were actual people that had died. And the chapter dealing with the holocaust and the camps will really open your eyes. Also before each chapter of the series we are treated to short ""introductions"" by the actual soldiers themselves. By seeing these men as they are today we grow even closer to the soldiers we see on the screen. Before I had seen Band of Brothers I had respect for the men and women who serve in our armed forces but I never really knew all that they had gone through. But now I have a deeper respect for every man and woman that has served and currently serves in our military and a deeper respect for those who have given their lives fighting for this country. THis DVD set is an excellent addition to any collection, In fact it is a must have for any collection. And the metal tin the set is encased in has to be one of if not the best packaging I have ever seen for a DVD set before."	5.0	Prepare yourself for the strongest and most emotional WWII story ever	2005-09-13	2	2	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2F6ZH6O0ZDSZ2	J. Rice	By far the best dramatic series on WWII that I've seen.  My only complaint comes from the gratuitous sex scene in episode 9.  I understand it is a reflection of reality, but could have been done more discreetly without adversely affecting the show.  In fact, I believe it would have enhanced the show.  Outside of that 15 seconds, I'm at a lost for words from everything from the camera work, scenery, music, acting and script.  The best!!!	5.0	When I start watching, I can't stop!!	2014-05-25	1	1	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AX1Z5RQ1LWMM2	j-rob-82	"I know there are plenty of reviews out there about Band of Brothers but I have never written any so I decided to give it a shot here.  1st off let me say I watched the original dvd version a few years ago and I was blown away by how the series was put together I didn't care about picture quality or sound.  Though picture and sound are nice it takes a back seat to what the series is all about.  So here is about the blu ray since the day I found out it was coming out for blu ray I knew I had to absolutely get this one.  One thing I did notice that someone who isn't a HD person odds are wont care about the amazing picture quality nor appreciate it.  Some people I know can look at it and really not tell a difference simply b/c they don't have the eye for HD or HD doesn't interest them.  I think pretty much everybody should see this series whether HD or not fan of war flicks or not.  The case is pretty much the same as the original and so is the inside of the case.  I didn't have a copy of the original to compare to but as far as I remember they are basically the same packaging even though this one I think is just a little smaller.Sticking the movies in at 1st is kind of annoying though it doesn't take long you have to sit through the warnings and HBO screen.  After that I had my 1st look at the blu ray version and I must say I am amazed by the quality such as richer blacks and color detail or even blades of grass.  Though the film grain still exists I am pretty sure its intentional since it's usually in battle scenes but I rather like film grain in this type of film.  I enjoy the grittiness and the shakiness of the camera that just add to the chaos of whats being shown.  I think that is what pulled me into Saving Private Ryan is just the overall rawness and chaos that was in WWII and the sense of realism with how the films were shot camera wise like (I think its called documentary style).The audio in this version is phenomenal and the sounds are just amazing even though the dvd version had good audio this one really shines like when you hear a Thompson, Garand, or an MG firing.  I guess its more about clarity and more dynamic when you have your surround sound cranked you can really have sound that jumps out and makes you say wow which most blu rays specialize at.  It made me really appreciate the sense of realism that was put into this series like hearing outdoor ambience or distant gunfire or how everything just has a distinct sound that you like to hear over and over.For some odd reason I kept listening to one part where there was a Carbine being shot by someone I can't remember but I think is in the episode about Carnetan.  One of my favorite parts in this regard is probably when they are about to jump in Disc 1 Ep. 2 and AA guns firing everywhere and planes getting holes shot in them and everything is just chaotic inside the planes as well as the outside.  So many parts from the series stick out in this regard like hearing the mortar strikes in Bastogne its just so much in each episode it would take a long time to write about it.I understand the realistic nature of whats being portrayed and all I am doing is pointing out how great the series is put together blu ray wise and not trying to sound like I am indulging in the violence.  I believe there is a great seriousness and respect that needs to be shown in regards to what is going on.Though the movie has actors the violence was real for the men of Easy Company as with everyone else in WWII.  What really makes this series hit such emotional peak with me is the openings and the extras that are from the actual men of Easy Company and not actors.  When I hear them speak of what they saw and what they felt I would have to say Band of Brothers was the series that finally got me to think and reflect on WWII.I know some people will watch it as just entertainment but it is so much more than that.  The extra like We Stand Alone Together which is a documentary that just amazes me to hear coming from the real people and it really pulled at my emotions.  I think the ending of the documentary is one of the greatest things I have ever seen or heard that brought me to tears when Winters shows his humility and talks about his grandchild asking him if he was a hero and I am sure most fans know what I am talking about.  To me those words resonate with me when I think about WWII.  Do yourself a favor and don't skip that documentary.  I think it would be great to have watched that before seeing the movie but no big deal.Since seeing the series for the 1st time a few years ago my respect grew greatly for ""The Greatest Generation"".  Blu ray or not this is far by one the greatest series ever and I found myself wishing there were more episodes since there is just so much about these men to tell indeed it was ""The Greatest Generation""."	5.0	As Time Passes the Memories of What Great Men Did Should Not	2008-12-04	17	15	2

The characters were wonderfully well formed,and you gathered a deep understanding of who they were.  The battle sequences were thrilling and very well done.As you watched the movie you find yourself living their lives, feeling their emotions and experiencing the fear in their hearts.  Everything was so real, from the troops just talking together, from them going into action, from them seeing the action around them, from them experiencing the pain of loss.  If you have not seen the movie, it is a mistake.  This movie is about during a time of full blown patriotism.  Some people, in small towns, committed suicide if they were not accepted in the military.  This was a time when we,as a country, were fighting for our very survival.  It is history in the making and should be seen by all.	5.0	A very moving war story	2014-03-12	1	1	0

If this was an individual that we had bought this from, their rating would be poor if all the items they sent were damaged like this (it was supposedly a brand new DVD we purchased). It's sad that Amazon can get by with it. I'm truly disappointed. I've never had bad luck like this when I purchased items from Amazon through an individual/business.	5.0	Band of Brothers	2009-11-03	1	0	1

He LOVES the series and will stop WHATEVER he is doing to pay full attention to it!  He was extremely excited to open this for Valentine's day...not my idea of romantic, but it worked for him!  I'm sure you will enjoy the Band of Brothers characters and storylines just as much as we do.  The interviews with the actual soldiers are so intriguing and moving, you just become so much more connected with the stories because you've seen the real people who lived through them.	5.0	Great gift!	2007-03-08	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AD7OLM1QFNJAT	Julie Staples	"I watched this mini-series from Episode 1, when it premiered on HBO, and catch it everytime that it's rebroadcast on HBO. Most episodes I've seen several times and I never tire of it. The cinematography is incredible, and the story of Easy Company keeps your interest throught the entire series.I ardently recommend this to anyone: For those who served bravely for their country, for those with family members who served, for the younger generation, and for the older generation. My grandfather served in the Army in World War II and I never quite understood what shaped him into the man he became until I saw this and Saving Private Ryan. It gives you such a glimpse into heroism, sacrifice, and honor and made me respect my grandfather and all who serve/served our country so bravely in the military to defend our freedom.Some people may be put off by how intense the fight scenes in this series are... and some (especially from my generation) may not see the need for a ""war mini-series"". But this brings you the harsh reality of what goes into defending democracy and freedom. You can't walk away from it not bringing a piece of it with you. So, in summary: Buy this mini-series! You won't be sorry and I hope you will be changed by it.I add one final note to all veterans and all servicepeople who may read this: I salute you and thank you. I can practice my first amendment liberties in writing this review because of your bravery. God's grace and peace be with each of you."	5.0	Truly Captivating	2002-09-03	11	10	1

Band of Brothers is not only excellent in terms of scripting, cinemetography and casting, but tells a story that will capture almost anyone who has a slight interest in history.This year we gave it to my father-in-law for Christmas.

But I'm not going to review the series, that's been done countless times before.  First off let me say that I am a hardcore Band of Brothers fan, and WW II history.  When I found out this was coming out on Blu-Ray I wanted it.  After reading the reviews of it, I bought a Blu-Ray player just for this series, that's how much I love it.  I love the picture-in-picture special feature, where you have the men of E company talking while the show is on.  However what I love most is the awesome picture.  I have the original DVD set, so I decided to do a comparison.  Well there was no comparison.  In the first episode where Sobel is grilling them at Camp Toccoa I notice on the original that you can't read his name tag on his uniform, but on Blu-Ray it is crystal clear, but anyway that's just one of the many details you can spot.  Excellent, and a must buy.	5.0	Wonderful on Blu-Ray	2008-12-11	6	4	2
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2GVVAO242EK1D	J. W. Mullins	Band of Brother is bar none the best war series ever produced. Saving Private Ryan was a great movie but only so much can be told in two hours. The ability for characters to develop and grow requires time and that is what Band of Brothers give you. You will see the highs and lows of war, you will see comradely develop between men who become closer than brothers. The acting is fantastic, the setting is great and the writing is spot on. This is the best series about war ever, any war, bar none. You will find yourself feeling the same highs and lows as the characters you grow to understand on the TV. Having been off to war a time or two this series really hits home. Combat no matter the time or war is brutal, you see the best of man and the worse and this series captures that like no other. I highly recommend this not just to the war movie/TV show fan, but to anyone. No one should ever forget the sacrifice made my our forebears to free the war of tyranny. A great series, you will not be disappointed in it.	5.0	As close to war as you can get without going to boot camp	2009-12-14	2	2	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1HSLBKA4HGXAF	"""jystrebler"""	"First, a quick rejoinder to the bitter people from Sweden and Germany who seem to base their reviews not on the content of the DVD, but on resentment that the US was on the winning side of WWII.I am not sure how we can deal with the fact that this is a ""typical"" US war movie with the US winning the war in the end.  As it stands, we've won more than we've lost, so our war movies tend to be about a winning effort.  On the other hand, our experience in Viet Nam has been thoroughly dramatized for the cinema, too.  So, we have spent as much time examining our successes as our failures.And we have known war on our shores as millions were involved in the American Civil War.  Not to mention a recent attack that killed 4,000 of our civilians who were not combatants in any way.Band of Brothers does portray scenes such as looting and the killing of POWs.  Some of it was by Americans, some by the French.  This is to show that the American and allied troops were not saints.  It is an honest assessment of the behavior of our fighting men and women.As for the people who called Lt. Spiers a war criminal, they missed the entire essence of what the movie was saying:  Spiers never killed those POWs, nor did he kill one of his own men, as was rumored.  He allowed the rumors to persist because it made him feared.  His well documented and well-witnessed exploits in combat are why he was a hero.Perhaps someday Germans will be honest enough to give us an honest portrayal of the less savory activities of their men in uniform during the second World War, complete with the murder of defenseless civilians, especially the Jews.Yes, we portray the Germans as sometimes being inept.  In other movies, we portray the Americans as being inept.  In this DVD set, we portray a British tank commander as being inept.  There was no shortage of ineptitude on any side of the war.  The fact that the particular unit was highly trained and was competent militarily, is no reason for apology.So, in a word, if you expect us to be sorry that we won, and that we stopped the spread of Nazism, and the extermination of the Jews, sorry.  We just don't feel that way.  We won, Europe is free as a result.  Deal with it.  If you dealt with the shortcomings of the German military in the frank and honest manner that US issues have been portrayed, you'd have more than enough national shame to last the rest of the 1000 year reich.As for the DVDs, they are magnificent and as good a job of depicting the books as I can imagine.  I had no idea that the airborne had origins in the best trained soldiers America produced in WWII.  That they trained for 2 straight years before seeing combat is an indication of how thoroughly prepared these men were.As a paratrooper during the cold war, I never had an inkling of the incredible origins of the original parachute infantry regiments.  They are much closer to Airborne Rangers than to today's 82nd Airborne.  Or, perhaps I should say, the Airborne Rangers are closer to them.The DVDs are fascinating first and foremost because it portrays the humanity of the men involved.  They had lives before and after the war.  They had families, they had friends.  As I read the book, the movie is very realistically portrayed.  Criticisms about the DVDs in terms of realism have been petty at best.  This is a very, very well done cinematic achievement.Sorry about the rant, but it seems that euro-trash never misses an opportunity to try and tear down our country.  Envy.  That's all it could possibly be.  Envy and knowledge of their inadequacy.  And perhaps some introspection as to why they were willing to let Saddam kill 200,000 a year, while doing nothing, then cursed the brave men and women who put Saddam's regime to and end."	5.0	Great story of some of the first and best commandos...	2003-04-15	26	19	7

Doesn't see a lot of WWII stuff -- he was mesmerized and watched it all the way through several times.  Actively avoids it at time. This presentation rang very true to him and perhaps even spoke to him.  (My son and I have watched it many times, in both the HBO and A&E; incarnations).Based upon Ambrose's wonderful oral history of an elite light infantry company in WWII (and its leadership) the production values are simply outstanding, and it communicates a sensibility about the war that rings true to all ages -- from 10 to 85.  I personally found the series to be uneven, and lacking in continuity, principally because the medium required a focus upon different characters in different episodes and, since it was based upon real events, there are necessary gaps in continuity.  Simply read Ambrose's book, and those problems are readily solved.It is difficult to identify a comparable movie or miniseries -- perhaps Stone's Platoon (which combined the real horror with the real bonds that formed amongst the men who fought) comes closest.  After that, the ""Combat"" TV series (written by men who had served in WWII is the closest analogy one can think of.For those without cable, and any interest in WWII or combat, this is a must own."	5.0	The best WWII miniseries	2006-12-26	4	3	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A5KMMY627T3W	Kate Stokes	This is one of the top 10 miniseries of all time. Flawless filmmaking and storytelling. I defy you to watch the first 15 minutes of part one and not finish it. Then I up the ante and further defy you not to immediately start watching part two right after the conclusion of part one.

It gave me a small glimpse of what my grandfather went through @ the Battle of the Bulge when he lost his arm from a grenade thrown into the tank he was commanding.(He never spoke of the war when he came home)  I truly appreciate the xtras that come w/the set; speaking to the real life veterans this series is based on.  The all star cast gave true emotion that is unparallelled in any other historic series.  I think they should show this in schools near Veterans Day so maybe our next generation will gain an appreciation of what past wars were like and what the fighting men and women went/go through.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A359ZF3AWW757X	Kathleen	After reading a few &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; books, I wanted to see the mini series of the same name.  It was an excellent purchase.  The acting, scenery, character portraits , and history were top notch.  These were a unique group of men who formed a lasting bond with each other.  From training camp in Georgia to the end of the war, they remained together.  The 101st Airborne suffered many casualties and deaths.  Yet they never gave up hope in their cause and in each other.Recommended to all World War II history buffs and those interested in a great story, &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; does not disappoint.	5.0	Loved It!	2013-02-21	2	2	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A113UQKB0PVZ8J	Kay	I saw this series on TV when it first came out in the 2000s.  I had stumbled across Stephen Ambrose's WW2 books when my late husband was in M. D. Anderson Cancer Center hospital in Houston, TX in early 2000.  I had picked up a Reader's Digest Condensed Book from lobby of hotel where I was staying and took it to his room to read something to him each afternoon.  One of Ambrose's books was featured and I began to read it to him as the days went along.  I had never heard of Ambrose until that time and found his works to be so fascinating.  I grew up during WW2 as a child and all that took place in my hometown connected to that event left a deep impression on the me.  My brother in law was in an anti-aircraft unit in Europe and landed on the D-Day beaches about 10 days after June 6, 1944 and later fought in the Battle of the Bulge.I bought this series of DVDs sometime in the mid 2000s to send to a close friend of my late husband.  This friend had served in Europe during WW2 in Army and was of German descent.  He was the consummate historian and after the war was over, took part in the Nuremberg trials.  He could quote verse and chapter of the events of WW2 and I thought this would be a great gift for him.  Sadly he passed away about 7 months after I had sent the series to him and his son gave the original gift of Band of Brother back to me after his father's death.I think Band of Brothers captures WW2 the most accurately of any movie I've ever seen.  Yes, it is brutal in parts but the cohesiveness of those soldiers in Easy Company is inspiring.I do not think again in our lives we will ever see the USA as united as it was during WW2.  People for the most came together and supported the war effort and did their part either with sons and husband in the armed forces or families at home enduring the life style of our country at war.About 3 years ago, my present husband and I were traveling back from NC to our home here in Georgia.  We stopped at the small town of Toccoa, Georgia in the foothills of the North Georgia mountains and visited The Band of Brothers museum that has been established there to honor those men of Easy Company.  It is a small excellent museum manned by volunteers and well worth a visit.  And yes, Mt. Currahee still stands.I have again this week of July 22nd watched my DVDs of Band of Brothers and once more felt inspired and proud of what my country did and accomplished during those very extremely difficult times during World War 2.  I cannot recommend this DVD enough for those who care for their country and have not forgotten the sacrifices made by so many during that dark time in this country's history.	5.0	Exceptional.	2013-07-26	2	2	0

I have been meaning to call or contact you but I dont know how this will work out.  I would greatly appreciate an e-mail or some type of contact to try and rectify this situation as you will clearly see that this happened when the disk was being developed or when the graphics were added to the top.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A9CIWRWUTQ0I4	Kevin	Stunning in HD, and uses the technology well.The new features for BD are great --- the time line is cool, but the extra interview footage from the real paratroopers is outstanding.As the action happens to the characters on-screen, the actual person will pop up to talk about it in interview footage not aired with the original series or on DVD. It includes some individuals that weren't shown previously at all, like a brief clip with Col. Robert Strayer.I watched the series to see it on BD, then I watched the whole series again with the in-program interviews. I wasn't bored for a second. I only wish there was more.I only have two gripes:1. There is a glitch in Episode 8 @ 48:35. I have found it on multiple copies of the BD. I have not found evidence that it is due to a layer break. This did not come from the digital film transfer for HD DVD (released in Japan), which is seemingly being used again for BD, pointing to manufacturing issues in the BD edition. The producers opted to use the VC-1 video codec over H.264/AVC, which was arguably the right choice (at least at the time) to preserve film grain.2. The BD takes unusually long to load --- 2 full minutes, even on a well-equipped PC --- and you are forced to watch several title screens.	5.0	Awesome	2009-02-26	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A5DP77B1NS0NZ	Kevin M	Well, it's been about a year since this magnificent series was aired on HBO.  I truly miss watching these top notch episodes with the highest caliber acting & storylines on the air. Last fall, when our country was reeling from an unprovoked attack on our soil, each episode of Band of Brothers was like therapy.  The stories of heroism, bravery, leadership, and good ol American soldiering gave me a feeling of pride in the soldiers that brought us the freedom we enjoy today. Watching Lt/Capt/Maj Winters & co. almost made me feel a part of the war on terror (vicariously anway).  I was not alone in being 'hooked' on each Sunday's installment of BoB either.  ...	5.0	Why Wait?	2002-08-20	3	2	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A133ZC2Z8MAIED	Kevin M Quigg	This is such a good mini-series to see that it is worth purchasing either a DVD or Video version of this film.  I read the book, and was somewhat reluctant to purchase and view the film.  Spielberg and Hanks do a great job in recreating the setting of that time.  Not only is the horror of war recreated, but the men's relations with each other develops.  When you face danger, you need to rely on the man in your platoon/battalion.  That need is shown throughout the book.  Good leadership such as that shown by Winters made these men what they became.  The book is a great example of the comradeship in war, but the film is a close second.  For those of you who view the film, read the book and vice versa.  The film and book are five stars.I usually don't watch many films or television, but I made an exception with Band of Brothers.  It is a great film on an even better book.  At the end of the film are some interviews with 506 PIR survivors, and this is very touching.  These men suffered so much for their country.  This was as good as the film itself.	5.0	Comrades in war and peace.	2006-02-20	3	2	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1KT1GWCW8F80	K. Gittins	"""World At War"" is probably the best documentary about WWII, but ""Band of Brothers"" is an excellent dramatization of the inception and training of Easy Company, 506 Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne, following them through the invasion of Normandy and action in Holland and Germany past VE day.The mini series is expansive and took 3 years to produce at a cost of $120 million, had 10,000 extras and 500 speaking roles, a back lot that was used as 11 different towns, some naked female breasts and male butts, and a lot of swearing.Though most actors are unknown, they all did a good job. It was executively produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks (who also has a minor role and was missed by me) based on the book by noted historian Stephen Ambrose.The 10 episodes with text-based summaries, a time-line and what is called the ""Field Guide"" of general information are on 5 disks. Bonus material, which includes interviews by survivors, a behind-the-scenes look, and main-actor Ron Livingston's ""video diary"", among other things, is on the sixth disk. All the disks are held in an accordion foldout that is anchored in an aluminum box.Highly recommended."	5.0	Great dramatization	2006-06-12	6	6	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AKS9SJTHTU0OM	K. Gordon	I'm probably going to movie hell, and break records for unhelpful votesfor not thinking this 10 part, 10 hour mini-series is perfect.And I did find the last 2 episodes tremendously powerful.But while it is beautifully, spectacularly produced, and is in manyways a fascinating history lesson, I had a hard time connecting to itemotionally.6 of the first 7 hours seemed like one non-stop battle after another,with very little time or focus given to the human beings. And when it we getto know people, they often felt like 'types', overly familiar fromother war films.And to be embarrassingly honest, there are so many characters, dressedin their look-alike army gear that I spent more time than I wantedwondering 'which guy is that?'I also felt, while it tried to be real and gritty, it still glamorizedwar a bit. Sort of trying to have its pacifist cake, and eat itsheroism and glory too,Certainly worthwhile, and I am very glad I saw it, but I think I wasway over prepared by years of hype.To be fair, at least a few professional critics eased my guilt bysharing my reservations. I'm not the only evil/crazy one on the planet.	4.0	I liked it a lot. I wish I loved it	2011-09-27	1	0	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2VFVB5V2NLQFF	"K. Hamblet ""internetexpert"""	There is nothing glorious or romantic about war. This portrayal of a true story is blunt and sometimes gory. It shows that the reality of war is limited to your immediate surroundings.  There is a constant conflict between duty and self-preservation. The mental toll on the soldiers is not hidden. It was very interesting to see how the diverse backgrounds and talents of the soldiers came together to create a strong fighting unit. This company then suffers through deaths, injuries, horrible conditions, and poor decisions from leaders.	5.0	One of the few honest war stories	2014-06-12	1	1	0

"We entered WWII reluctantly, appeared to be loosing it often (especially towards the beginning of the war), sacrificed mightily, and prevailed in the end.Just how much did those young men who stormed the beaches sacrifice?  Watch this series and find out for yourself.  You will walk away with a new respect for our fighting men and what it really takes to ""let freedom ring.""This series shows the human side of WWII.  From sleeping in snow crusted trenches dug out painfully, one shovelful at a time in frozen ground, to going without basic needs like jackets and shoes in the snow because supply lines were cut off.  This series is very intense and very honest.  You will fall in love with certain characters and they will die on you.This is not Hollywood; this is WWII and sometimes it is hell.I would not and could not recommend it for young children.  The violence, though not overdone, is intense.  There is one s*x scene, where they flash to the ""event"" only long enough for you to know what was interrupted by the door opening and ""time to move on.""  (The thing some parents may like about this particular scene is--tiny spoiler here--that the service person involved ends up with a very uncomfortable side effect in the middle of a battle field with no instant RX to cure it.  In other words, there are consequences for being careless with s*x.)I would recommend this series for mature children 12 and older.  If your child is not mature for his/her age, you should hold off until they are 14 or 15; however, every child should see this.This series isn't just a history series; this is a series packed full of life lessons.  There is brotherhood, sacrifice, good overcoming evil, endurance and perseverance, and so much more, to be seen acted upon in the most difficult of circumstances by men who, just a few months or weeks before, didn't even know each other.Buy this series.  Loan it out to friends too cheap to buy it.  Show it to your kids and their friends once they are old enough to watch it.  This really is one series no one should miss.And a great big thank you to all the men who have harkened to the call and sacrificed by serving our country overseas.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AOH621VB8ZYQ1	kimberleelee	Technically a mini-series, not &#34;Season 1&#34; just in case anyone is hoping for a Season 2.  Follows a single company (Easy Company) of a battalion paratroopers on the European front in WWII from D-Day to the end.  Easy Company is an actual company and each episode starts with snippets of documentary interviews from its actual surviving members that recount whatever piece of the story the episode portrays.  It was a very effective way to communicate the reality of what you then see dramatized.I also liked the focused perspective - a lot of historical WWII dramas either try to tell the story of the whole war effort, follow a single character or a shorter span of time (one big battle or something, such as The Thin Red Line or Flags of Our Fathers), or focus on the Holocaust itself...  Not that I dislike those films, it's just that this was actually different; unique. The collective story from a group of soldiers (the &#34;band of brothers) covering their entire enlistment was a refreshingly thorough approach and you really had a chance to care about each individual over the course of multiple episodes (as opposed to 2-3-hour films where even a great actor can only do so much character work).It's a fabulous cast playing the soldiers; each episode has a different one of them narrating for the most part. Pretty sure the &#34;main character&#34; - to the extent that Damian Lewis' character is sort of the core of the story - narrates more than one, but you get a few different narrators throughout.  The medic's episode was one of my standout favorites - he got to narrate the &#34;battle of the bulge&#34; episode, and it was pretty crazy; his role in the company was really quite special.I almost didn't give 5 stars because I get turned off by the occasional &#34;USA! USA!&#34; moments, but I got over it because, to be honest, it wasn't propagandizing (although so many war films do in the interest of painting American soldiers as more virtuous than they truly are). That's just the mindset the soldiers *have* to be in in order to survive and keep going in the face of all the horror.  You have to be on a mission to justify killing soldiers who you know are also just young boys following orders.  That psychological reality was very well communicated here.So, all in all, I loved it. :)	5.0	I rarely give TV & movies 5 stars, just FYI.	2014-07-08	0	0	0

This series took my breath away the first time I saw it.  And now having it with the clarity of Blu-ray does so again.It is as powerful a war drama as there has ever been.  The telling of the events from the actual GIs who were there adds tremendously to the accuracy and credibility of this drama from Easy Company's boot camp through the end of the war.  We owe so much to these valiant American's who put their lives on the line so that we could live ours to the fullest and have the freedom we so richly enjoy.  This series is very profound and presents the events in an accurate, believable, and an unapologetic manner and allows you, the viewer, to make your own ultimate conclusions.I wish that this video series (and the John Adams series Also by HBO) was a viewing requirement in every high school American history class in the country.  I find it sad how historically ignorant the people of this country have become as OUR own history is being dumbed down in the school systems due to revisionists who want to distort the reality of our true history and the deeply founded beliefs of its founders.  I believe that it is a responsibility of every American to learn and know the TRUE history of AT LEAST this country and its people.  How can we possibly know where we are going if we don't know where we have been.  ""Those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it"".  We have access to so much information between books, videos, and the internet that there is no excuse except for self-centered apathy for such ignorance.

This being said, I think anyone who enjoys a good action movie will enjoy this series, and at $43 it was impossible for me to pass up.  For me, in my mid-twenties, it really gave me a new perspective on how hard some people did have it during the wars.  There were no choices to join the force, you were drafted and that's the way it was.  And the concentration camps...  They make serving in war and fighting for your freedom seem like something you'd do for fun.  Overall, in my book it is well worth the $40+.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	ABI5DQG0FBWU2	"K. Patton ""K. Patton"""	"Just finished watching all the disks and was amused by the previous posts.  Seems Amazon has becomea soapbox for Eurotrash.  That's okay.  At least they have free speech here.  I might remind some ofour Russian Comerads that if it wasn't for the mighty U.S. bringing Joe Steel, Nikita, Leonid and company'shouse of cards down into a steaming pile, they would still be living in a third world superpower state.Now they just live in a third world state, but have free speech.  Oh, I might add that we are waiting for thebillions you owe us in lend lease aid that you never paid back.  Maybe you should read the new editionsof those communist party history books you were brought up on. If it hadn't been for Uncle Sam's aidboth in material and in drawing most of the Luftwaffe back to western europe, you'd be employed washingsome Deutche technocrat's BMW, OR be a forgotten corpse in some mass grave.For the mentally challenged who couldn't follow the story line...well I can only surmise you missed the littleschool bus once too often and still possess the disabilities you were born with.You might not agree with the depiction, but the events were based on true events and characters.  Sorry if oursoldiers weren't too fond of charging into massed MG34's, something Ivan appears to have been quite fond offor the greater glory of the Motherland, Joe Steel and Gen Chechov.  I have news for our revisionist's inthe great USSR, er sorry I mean Russia, the empire formerly known as the USSR.  Huge casualty lists does nota great struggle make nor admiration earn.  Your own communist commisars executed the equivelent of a fullUS division...10,000 men, all to instill ""patriotic"" zeal in the troops. Could you blame them for wanting to go home to Ivana and a full bottle of vodka, rather than face the near certainty of death charging into the muzzle of an MG-42? So are we to have admiration for an army that had no regard for it's own men wasting them with little regard for questionable gains?Let's remember what Joe Steel once said "" The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.""  So, the Great Patriotic war was a statistic. Let's look at those statistics...If it had not been for the invasion of Europe and the drawing away of some of the Wehrmachts finest divisions toboth Italy and France, the Soviet manpower well would have run dry earlier with devastating consequences.The Soviet Army was tapped out after the battle of Berlin where over a million were wasted fighting for the honor of capturing a pile of smoldering bricks courtesy of the US Army Air Corp and the British Bomber Command  (PS we could have done the same thing to any city in the USSR at the time with impunity after a little forward basing into France or Germany).The post-soviet revisionists need to read the declassified documents now available to learn the actual extent of their country's betrayal of thier own troops during the Great Patriotic War.I read the book then threw it across the room and into the trash.  The movie is better.  The book comes offas self promoting and congradulatory drek by a known plagarist.  Stephen Ambrose was apparently slipping in hislater years, His family book mill does not help his writing, I once assume it was a cadre of grad students ghost writing for him, now I learn that it his extended family, which would probably explain the plagiarism inat least one of his more recent works.What the movie leaves out is the often lengthy withdrawls the 101st had from the front between engagements.Something the regular line divisions never had.  This was convienently glossed over in the movie.  It makes the combat fatigue lament in the book hard to swallow when many more endured the same for longer duration.  Sure these guyswere fearless, lucky and had balls as big as all out doors.  BUT, so did the lowly dogfaces in the regular linedivisions that stayed at the front for months on end.  Let's sing their praises too.Just like the USMC, the Airborne seems to have grabbed more than their fair share of the glory and accolades due to press savy brass such as Ridgway, no slouch in the PR department.The biggest criticism I have of the movie is the now cliche interviews, not with the participants, but the ACTORS!!I mean they took the overblown actor's commeraderie lauded in the LOTR trilogy to new conceited heights!!Who gives a great goddamn about the recounting of historical events by some actor playing army soldier who was born35 years after the event, and probably slept through history class too boot?  They are obviously regurgitatingthe material given to them to prep them for the roll.  Guys, stick to acting we don't care what you think, just scream anddrop dead on cue."	4.0	Good Movie with flaws...Not as bad as the EuroTrash say	2004-10-01	55	10	45

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AXS0MDH2OLAVI	"""kristian077"""	This DVD is another typical american war- story were american soldiers defeat their enemy. Other features in this series are Panther tanks (Best tank of WWII) that doesn't fire when confronted with Shermans, and therefore are blown sky high. A few evil germans who flee as soon as they see a US- soldier are also added, as usual. The americans never loose a scirmish, in the end they are always saved by someone or something. So to sum this up: This DVD- box is a must for those of you who love seeing americans killing germans and looting their pockets afterwards. It also features american soldiers executing lots of german POW's and of course no one is punished afterwards. If you like that, then this is the thing for you, for all of you who have seen american war- movies in the past, stay away, you have seen it all before.	2.0	Another american war- story	2003-02-20	186	30	156

The film is excellent, and you can see my review of the DVD to be satisfied with that fact. The bluray disks however are poorly produced and flawed. Perhaps by the time I write this, the problem has been fixed, as I ordered mine with the first batch produced. Half of the disks are poorly manufactured. The voices do not sink, the color bleeds out, and sometimes it just glitches. Some disks are brilliant and stunning, however, some are absolute garbage. IT IS NOT my bluray player. It works great on some disks, and other films.An example of what happens.On Disk 2, Carentan, the voices will often not match at all. The color becomes fuzzy, and at best looks like a VHS taped from HBO.During Replacements, the same disk, the color goes to nearly black and white. The blue flowers however are so bright, they bleed into the other colors around them.This happens on several different disks. This is just an example of poor manufacturing. I have tried to get replacement disks to no real avail.Again, the movie is wonderful, Hollywood style historical, and dramatic. I love the film.

It is graphic and somewhat `theatrical' at times, but not over the top, it doesn't have to be, the story is powerful enough by itself.If you are familiar with the series, then you should also buy this.  I owned the same box set on DVD, but when you watch it on Blu-ray, it's a completely new experience.I bought this on sale at on Amazon for under $40.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A10610LHTIBAVR	"Kurt Carmichael ""Kurt"""	"The only 'fact' worth speaking about from this caricature of a movie is the fact that E company suffered a 150% death rate (in other words, that its members were killed and replaced 1.5 times before war's end).  Very few soldiers made it to the end of the war on either side unlike this overglorified depiction.  Some of the more gratuitous passages in this miniseries were the liberation of concentration camps in episode 8: entitled 'Why We Fight', where it depicts the SS officer's widow scrabbling to bury dead prisoners and infers by the scene that the Germans exceeded other nationalities in organized cruelty.  People watching the miniseries forget that Hitler's Germany was a prison and anyone (Jew, German or anyone else of any rank) contradicting the authorities met a similar fate to those in the prison camps--independence was not tolerated.  The movie calls the concentration camps such as Landsberg am Lech in Germany presumptuously a ""death camp"" but what is conveniently forgotten by the miniseries is that NO concentration camp in territorial Germany was a ""death camp"" (designed primarily for killing 'undesireables'), these were apparently sited outside of Germany proper, in Eastern Europe.The miniseries is also factually wrong on the death toll; the International Red Cross (which had access to the camps throughout the war) holds that the numbers dying in the German internment camp system during the war were about 500,000.  Why then does this movie and others like it keep promoting 'the 6 million' number or some other variant (as this miniseries does) 'the 6 million jews + 5 million other nationalities'? [This author believes that the German numbers are inflated in order to make the annihilation of Ukrainian kulaks (8 million), Orthodox priests (300,000) and other non-communist Russians (more than 40 million) by our ""illustrious"" ally, Bolshevik Russia, seem more reasonable and palatable.  As this logic goes, if the Germans were more murderous than Stalin, they deserved destruction and punishment.  The fact that they were less, even much less cruel than the communist Russians, calls into question our involvement in this war, our national judgment and our choice of allies].What is not explained by the miniseries (in fact, nothing contextual is explained at all, leaving viewers in their prejudices and biases) was that the camp in question was an internment camp that had lost its supply of food and pesticide due to American Army Air Corps aerial bombardment of rail lines supplying the camp.  Without resupply, the camps became isolated starvation centers by default.  The miniseries also badly misstates medical knowledge of refeeding syndrome that existed at the time.  In the movie, the brigade surgeon (doctor) is seen warning the soldiers not to give the prisoners food due to their starved condition.  This is a scene concocted by ex post facto screenwriting. In actual fact, once ""liberated"", most camps were bombarded with food from extra K-rations provided the prisoners by well-meaning soldiers.  This abundance of food killed approximately 50% of the surviving camp inmates due to the great electrolyte imbalances caused by too much food, too quickly.  Medical knowledge thus came AFTER and as direct result of the  liberation experience, Americans killing more inmates than they saved by their 1940's-era lack of understanding about how to feed prisoners that were starving.  In general, this miniseries is another whitewash of American intentions concerning intervention (first, to stop Hitler from invading other countries and later, because of mistreatment of other nationalities), general confusion about the war and is a one-sided display of American ""justificationalism"".  About the only thing that was true was the willingness of American soldiers to loot private (non-public) German property (wine cellars, alcohol, restaurant silver utensils, ""war souvenirs"") at every turn and claim somehow that we were the 'good guys'.  This series isn't history folks but it looks so enticing, many people think that it is!"	1.0	An unhealthy serving of fiction couched as fact	2011-12-27	79	9	70

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A16X61RLY1YJL7	"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid"""	"Band of Brothers is an awe inspiring and visually stunning tribute, not only to Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, but to the ""Greatest Generation.""  But for their sacrifices, would we share the freedoms we so cherish and covet to our vests today!  Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg deserve all of the awards and accolades they received for bringing this epic to HBO and now this incredible DVD box set!Part 1 - Currahee - Currahee is a wonderful beginning to this unprecedented HBO miniseries.  Outside of the movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" there has never before been such a realistic series such as this one.  Currahee poignantly highlights the training that was necessary for the newly designed Airborne Infantry.  While some may think that Captain Sobel was a complete idiot, in all truth, his combat skills were obviously lacking however, as a trainer, he put Easy Company in a very good position as a well trained unit.Part 2 - Day of Days - D-Day has arrived and Easy Company makes the jump that they've been preparing two years for.  As history unfolds, the German flak has caused nearly every plane to miss their designated drop zone.  1LT Winters finds he's in Normandy, lost his weapon and his company.  He finally arrives at the assembly area and is given the mission to take out a German artillery position.  Day of Days is an excellent episode that doesn't miss out on 1LT Winters depth of emotions as he loses his first soldier in combat.Part 3 - Carentan - Easy Company is ordered in to take the French village of Carentan.  While encountering only minor resistance, they take light casualties.  After successfully taking the town, they're ordered to move on to the next objective.  En route, they encounter the German force sent to retake Carentan.  They stalemate for the evening, expecting to forge a full assault in the morning.  The Germans have other plans though and counter attack in the morning with a combined force of mechanized infantry and armor.  Fortunately for Easy Company, they are finally rescued by the 2nd Armored Division.  Shortly after this action they are lucky enough to get some R&R; back in England.  The show ends with orders back to the front and a very poignant final scene to yet another wonderful episode.Part 4 - Replacements - Replacements jumps forward to September and Easy Company is on R&R; in England.  They're called into Operation Market Garden.  Easy Company is given the mission to take Eindhoven, Holland.  They were told they would be running into light resistance.  Operation Market Garden turns into a huge failure and the Allied Forces are turned back with heavy casualties.  Sgt ""Bull"" Randleman is quite unfortunate enough to get stuck behind enemy lines.  ""Replacements"" is another excellent episode.Part 5 - Crossroads - Crossroads is one of the best shows of the whole miniseries.  Captain Winters, due to the costs of war, garners advancement from Easy Company Commander to Battalion Executive Officer.  The episode is shown, through the eyes of Captain Winters as he is preparing a report on the actions of October 5th when he led his company in the attack of a German SS position.  The more telling part is later in the episode when he gets an R&R; in Paris and the horrors of war catch up to him.Part 6 - Bastogne - To quote Captain Winters, ""we're paratroopers; we're supposed to be surrounded.""  Bastogne tells the tale, from Easy Companies point of view, about the 101st Airborne Infantry being surrounded by German forces and holding the line during the Battle of the Bulge.  This is also the combat action where the Commanding General of the 101st Airborne replied to the German Commanders request for their surrender, ""nuts.""Part 7 - The Breaking Point - January 1945 and Easy Company is on the verge of attacking the Germans in Foy, Belgium.  Due to heavy resistance, Easy Company endures nearly a month of being barraged by German artillery on the front line.  This episode is very telling as far as the how demoralizing the artillery can be.Part 8 - The Last Patrol - Easy Company is on the front line in the Alsacian town of Haguenau.  They now have the sense that the war is coming to a close, as they are just across the river from Germany.  The brigade commander orders a patrol across the border to secure German prisoners.  This episode again brings to the forefront the emotions of the soldiers as they again are counted on to accomplish their mission!Part 9 - Why We Fight - This episode is clearly the most poignant of the series as Easy Company finds and liberates a concentration camp.  Although there had been rumors of these concentration camps, no once could truly comprehend what they were about until they were faced with them!  This episode alone should've garnered several awards.Part 10 - Points - Easy Company takes Eagles Nest, Hitler's mountaintop fortress.  The company settles in as an occupation force, yet expecting to be redeployed to the Japanese warfront.  A very emotional what happened to several of the units members after the war.  Overall, this episode is a fantastic conclusion to the ""Band of Brother.""Disk SevenWe Stand Alone Together:  The Men of Easy Company - An outstanding documentary containing interviews with surviving members of Easy Company!  Once you've seen all of the episodes, this documentary introduces you to the real members of Easy Company.Ron Livingston's Video Diaries - This is an exceptional set of clips filmed by Ron Livingston, who played Lieutenant Nixon, covering the ""actor boot camp"" run by Captain Dale Dye, USMC Retired.HBO's The Making of Band of Brothers' - This is another excellent ""Making of"" clip by HBO, covering the creation of this spectacular miniseries! {ssintrepid}"	5.0	Band of Brothers - The Ultimate WWII experience!	2002-12-31	681	652	29

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1ITZ3Z6P3LUVH	LadyArlette	"When I first sat down to watch this series several years ago, I was fully prepared to be barraged with another lousy interpretation of the Second World War, courtesy of Hollywood. It had been so long since I had seen a war movie that was historically accurate and truly deserving of the label ""masterpiece."" In the years leading up to ""Band of Brothers"", I had been forced to sit through countless modern war movies that had me grimacing in my seat (""Pearl Harbor"", anyone?), with only ""Saving Private Ryan"" somewhat impressing me. The older war movies were great (""The Longest Day"", ""The Great Escape"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", etc..."") but the lack of cinematic technology made it impossible to truly depict the horrifying experience of war.But when I saw ""Band of Brothers"" -- WOW! I was blown out of my seat! Never before had I fully appreciated the sacrifice our brave soldiers made while fighting in WWII. The series pulls you into the mindset of a soldier, in which you can feel the raw fear and anxiety that accompanies harsh combat. I jumped at every gun shot, and yelped at every mortar round.The acting throughout is superb. You can easily connect with many of the (real!) characters portrayed, and you cheer for them, cry for them, and mourn for them. But kudos must be given to Damian Lewis for his portrayal of Maj. Richard D. Winters, who is one of the most pivotal characters in the series. You'll easily learn to love the character. And if you don't know much about Mr. Lewis' background, you will be shocked to find that he's British, especially after carrying a perfectly convincing Pennsylvania Dutch accent in the series.Not much more can be said about ""Band of Brothers"" that hasn't already been said, only that it is undoubtedly one of the best things to ever be put on film. It deserves far more than five stars.Too bad the Oscars don't recognize miniseries. ""Band of Brothers"" would have swept it."	5.0	Simply the Best -- Curahee!	2006-01-15	4	4	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AP28EU980272X	Lakan Kildap	"This was broadcast in HDTV, so if I say the picture quality is superb, it's stating the obvious.  Yet I still think it needs to be said.  This series in one of the best excuses for buying a DVD player.  The audio?  Never mind the battle scenes, to measure the quality of the audio mixing and resolution of this box set, just keep your ears open for those typewriter sounds in the 'peaceful' scenes!! If you didn't know better, you'd think someone in your house is really typing on an old-style Underwood.  I had to rush out of the room and check (we do have a manual typewriter)!Of course, I did feel sometime during my viewing that I was watching an extended version of Saving Private Ryan, which gets many repeat viewings from me.  But then I remembered: the movies are based on true stories, I shouldn't be complaining.  If there's a similarity, maybe because much of the creative genius in ""Ryan"" was in BOB too.War movie enthusiasts will like the second episode (""Day of Days"", the D-Day parachute drop) and the third (""Carentan"").  The ""Bastogne"" episode is more like ""Battleground (available on VHS)"", they deal with the same event, more character development than gore, more snow than fire.  You'd get the idea just how cold it was there, and how desperate the defense was.  ""Points"" was heart-rending in the end.  And of course, there's the discovery of the concentration camp, which just about snuffs out your breath.  Many Americans went to war with little understanding of what they were fighting for.  Many were wondering what they were doing in Europe, when the first blow against them was struck by the Japanese.  After the finding of the concentration camps, there was no more debate.  They were fighting because a blow has been struck against humanity.The performances were superb, and rightly toned down for the era (not too many swear words).  Damian Lewis has a screen presence that is rare today.The real heroes of the last great war were not the high-profile men who got their names on history books.  The real heroes were the ordinary people who did the jobs that were handed to them, admirably and without fanfare."	5.0	Are there no more stars in heaven?  I need some more...	2003-02-15	0	0	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A19XD98DT83MPD	Lama	"This is a great show, obviously.  Spielberg, Hanks, and HBO deserve high praise for delivering the story of Easy Company to the masses.  I echo just about every accolade written by the other reviewers (at least those I've read). And it comes in a lovely tin case to boot.But here comes the ""but"":  I cannot understand why the producers of the DVD did not include English subtitles.  It seems incredible to me that such an omission is even possible in enlightened times.  Reviewers with hearing impairments have already complained about this.  But even those of us whose hearing is fine have a legitimate beef.  My wife isn't exactly a war movie fan, so I watch films like this after she turns in for the night.  Consequently, I have to keep the volume low.  Which is why I always turn on the subtitles.  But B.o.B. has no English subtitles to turn on.  As a result, I missed about a third of the dialogue.  (Yes, I know there are remote headphones that I could buy, but why should I have to shell out $50 to encumber my ears when subtitles would do the trick?)Of all the DVDs I own, these are the very first to deny me the courtesy of English subtitles/closed captioning.  Unconscionable.  At the very least, there should be a prominently-placed caveat on the packaging (and at the top of Amazon's product description): ""Warning: No English Subtitles.""  I thought of asking for a refund based on the near-fraudulent omission of captions, but I'll refrain.  Instead, I'll just plan to watch the series again -- when my wife goes on her next business trip and I can turn up the volume."	3.0	Great Series; but DVD features a Major Omission	2011-06-09	8	2	6

For a series with a platoon-sized cast, you'd think it's hard to relate to the characters, but no, as the characters meet one another, we get to know them, we follow them from the beginning 'til end, and grow to love them.

I hate war films for the uncanny Hollywood tendancy to deliver story arcs and nice endings. This is all about a journey of such an un repeatable nature that it could only be told in excruciating and beautiful detail.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ	Larry Scantlebury	Television has been reviled for years and quite deservedly so. It is the most beautiful of persons, now walking the streets for cheap thrills and money.It is the brilliant chemists and doctors who can remove pain from the elderly, now turning out liters of poison for cash. But once in awhile, television does something so inspiring, so incredible, so extraordinary, that we are left speechless. Such is Band of Brothers.Henry the Fifth continues with his monologue, 'for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.' They changed the world. Without them, Normandy was in doubt. Bastogne was in doubt. Berlin was in doubt. Europe was in doubt. The world was in doubt.I have to chuckle at some of the detractors to this brilliant compendium of the story of Easy Company, 101st Airborne, that we Americans think too highly of ourselves. Damn right!The remarkable thing about Easy company and the 101st  . . . and the guys that flew the hump in India, and the guys that gave close air support at Guadacanal, and the guys that held the line at Bastogne, is just that. They were just guys. No Stallone. No Duke. No Chuck Norris. These guys were from Decatur and Compton and Farmingdale and Bloomington and Tulsa and Omaha and the Ypsilanti.They were car mechanics and conductors on subways and teachers and kids who lied about their age while still in high school.This is the most remarkable thing ever put on television. Are there better shows? I don't know. Not many. 10 stars wouldn't be enough. I envy you if you haven't seen it although I've seen it 3 times and it still puts tears in my eyes.

It is so well made, I feel I am there fighting with the troops against the Germans in World War II. The series starts with D-Day and this HBO Show is filmed almost like a war reporter would do back then and the acting, realism and insight into the personal tragedies of warfare is very realistic, even though I have never been in that situation myself, but I am sure I would be if another tyrant attempts to do this again.

While it is somewhat dramatized, it also seems to be a very accurate protrayal of life as a combat soldier in Europe.  The story follows these men from basic training through VE Day.  It certainly highlights the debt Americans owe to this generation of men who stood up for freedom and put everything on the line to protect the USA as well as the world from totalitarianism.  Their sacrifice of time away from home and safety to ensure the freedoms we still enjoy today is a debt we can never repay, yet we must never forget.  Watching these DVDs will remind you that freedom isn't free and it comes at a tremdous personal sacrifice from our military personnel.

You can see and &#34;feel&#34; the MG42 rounds whizzing by the soldiers as they battle the Germans.  I'm also Very impressed at the use of real German Half Tracks and Tanks (rare) such as the Tiger, Jagdpanther Stugg III and maybe even a Panther? Needless to say, the amount of realistic looking tanks, tracks, artillery, weapons and gear are astounding.The series also brings you into the life and death of Easy Company in ways that movies like Saving Private Ryan could not.  It was simply too short.  BoB accomplishes this in spades.	5.0	Realistic feel just like Saving Private Ryan	2014-05-30	1	1	0

Most of those who criticize this production probably have never experienced how intense the sacrifice our GIs made in doing their duty. I am in awe and very proud of all of these men as portrayed in the film.My father spent about 13,000 hours in the Army Air Corps during WWII and let me tell you, there is a lot to be believed here 1st hand.We are in the midst of another confligration in the middle east and all of us must remember the &quot;WHY&quot; Americans do these things.

One reviewer said it was not as &quot;real&quot; as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.  Well, excuse me, but this was REAL!  Private Ryan was fiction. It was written and honed by Hollywood.  I am sorry that real life is not as exciting as fiction but this series was accounts of real men who actually lived this war!

It keeps coming up as an ""unrecognized"" disc in my Sony BDP-BX1 (Costco's S350 equivalent).  I'm an avid firmware updater for just about everything in the house and I am definitely up to date on the Blu Ray player.  All other discs tested fine, but I'm a bit irritated at having paid for a full box set and only being able to utilize 5 of the 6 discs.  I'm willing to bet that if I can even find a customer service contact number for HBO, they're going to want some money for a replacement disc.Don't get me wrong, this is a 5 star series (by far) but I could only give this product purchase one less star than 5, since I can use 1 less disc than what I paid for."	4.0	Disc 2 Will Not Play	2008-12-23	2	1	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AFOK05KDCHSHL	Libretio	BAND OF BROTHERS (2001)Aspect ratio: 1.78:1Soundtracks: Dolby 5.1 / DTS 5.1The trials and tribulations of Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, from the D-Day landings in Normandy to their capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Austria at the end of World War II.Co-produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, HBO's epic 10-part miniseries (based on a terrific bestselling book by the late Stephen E. Ambrose) was the most expensive TV undertaking of its day, costing a massive $120 million to produce. And, as the old saying goes, every penny is up there on the screen. Borne from the success of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) - with which it shares a similar dramatic and visual style - BAND OF BROTHERS' recreation of a glorious (and hard-won) chapter in American history assumed an even greater patriotic significance during its initial US broadcast, when it coincided with the horrific attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center in September 2001.Written with economy and grace, and directed with emotional intensity by a series of directors (including Phil Alden Robinson, Richard Loncraine and Hanks himself) whose combined efforts achieve a genuine aesthetic uniformity, the movie is a masterpiece of storytelling and historical documentation. Punctuated by horrific battle sequences, in which the camera is placed within mere inches of the death and destruction, the film manages to transcend its educational remit by its relentless focus on the human cost of war. Almost every episode opens with testimony from surviving members of Easy Company (none of whom are identified until the end of the series), which further strengthens the emphasis which BAND OF BROTHERS - book and film - places on the bonds which drew them together in times of conflict. And, because it's a true story, there's no telling from one episode to the next which of the 'characters' will live or die, which makes it all the more potent and visceral.The entire production represents quality writ large: Beautifully filmed on various European locations (including the UK and Austria), the movie is noble without being the least bit pompous or austere, and it manages to humanize a large cast of essential characters with small touches of humanity and humor, all of which serves to heighten the sense of terror as they descend into the maelstrom of conflict. The first - and longest - episode is deceptively staid, featuring David Schwimmer (a long way from TV's 'Friends') as the bullying, cowardly commanding officer Herbert Sobel, whose tyrannical methods nevertheless shaped Easy Company into a fighting force which eventually cut a swathe through the heart of occupied Europe. Brit actor Damian Lewis takes the spotlight thereafter as Easy Company's most respected platoon leader, Richard Winters, with Ron Livingston as his right hand man, Lewis Nixon. Other standout performances in a flawless cast include Matthew Settle as battle-hardened platoon leader Ronald Speirs whose wartime career was distinguished by numerous acts of bravery (fuelled by a unique - if morbid - personal philosophy), Shane Taylor as company medic Eugene Roe, Neal McDonough as 2nd lieutenant 'Buck' Compton (laid low by his horrific combat experiences), and Donnie Wahlberg as 1st sergeant C. Carwood Lipton, who maintained the morale of his fellow soldiers, even when the odds seemed stacked against them.Every episode has its merits, but stand-outs include David Leland's 'Bastogne' (ep. 6), which recounts the horrendous circumstances surrounding Easy Company's involvement in the Battle of the Bulge, and David Frankel's 'Why We Fight' (ep. 9), in which the full horror of the Nazi regime is uncovered in a German forest. Additionally, the closing moments of chapter 10 ('Points', directed by Mikael Salomon) are truly heartbreaking.Like the movie itself, HBO's region 1 DVD is magnificent. Housed in a beautifully embossed metal case, all ten episodes are spread across five discs (running a total of 624m 23s). Crucially, each disc contains biographical information on the soldiers represented in every episode, which allows the viewer to keep track of an extensive array of characters, and there's a useful glossary, map and timeline of Easy Company's advance across Europe. Perhaps the number of chapters per episode could have been doubled (as it stands, there are six for each instalment), but that's a minor glitch in an otherwise exemplary presentation. The sixth disc in HBO's package contains a fascinating, feature length documentary on the real members of Easy Company (essential viewing), and a series of video diaries by actor Ron Livingston of the boot camp to which many of the cast were subjected in preparation for filming, during which the actors seem to have cultivated the same bonds of friendship experienced by real soldiers in combat situations.It's doubtful that a more fitting tribute to the men of Easy Company could have been devised than BAND OF BROTHERS, a truly remarkable experience, given the Rolls Royce treatment on DVD. By turns engrossing, provocative and deeply, profoundly moving, it stands as a testament to those who fought and died for our freedoms, almost a lifetime ago.	5.0	Powerful testament to the human spirit	2003-09-01	5	3	2
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AYB8T9MPB6G0J	Lightning Bug	My uncle was a radioman with the 101st on D-Day and until the end of the War. He came home after the War with two Purple Hearts and one Bronze Star. Spoke very little about his war experience. I doubt any of us could have understood him if he had. I watched this series with an eye to understanding his life during that last year of the War. Very well done and included interviews with some of the remaining vets from the 101st.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1VY73QWPAH5D	Like a Rock	The series follows the book very well. The series was also filmed with characters that resemble the actual soldiers of Easy Company. You have caucasion, italian, jewish, latino, etc.  Unlike another series that follows the Pacific Campaign and uses mostly actors of a certain ethnic background, the Men of Easy are realistically portrayed and the series is a believable film that was well thought out and filmed magnificently. It is very hard to choose a certain character as a favorite because they are all great and obviously put their hearts and souls into portraying the real soldiers who endured the invasion of France and subsequent countries in the European Campaign. This series is a true piece of artwork that will surely be one the greatest accounts of WWII. I highly recommend anyone interested in seeing this series buy the book, read a couple chapters and then start the series following behind your reading. Small details in the series come alive that you would otherwise not have the background on due to limitations in film time. Although this was produced as a TV series, I think its the best 10 hour movie ever produced as it is of similar quality if not better than the WWII movie, Saving Private Ryan (1998).	5.0	Filmed well with characters that resemble the real soldiers of Easy	2014-06-10	1	1	0

What an undertaking this must have been for the hundreds of crew members and their leaders. Much as the band of men who fought the battles, this crew and directors, assistants, writers, producers and actors had to come together to master a real life story with honesty, bravery and  courage in a way that did honor to those who fought and died and those who fought to live.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1D4CMEHUE1UXI	Lisa Hanna	Gripping, deeply moving account of the 101st Airborne's Easy Company in WW2. If you are a fan of the Stephen Ambrose book on which this is based, you will love this series. The characters are well developed, from their early days in training all the way through to the end of the War. Each episode begins with the real Easy Company survivors quietly telling their story to the camera, giving bits of insight on some particular battle or issue the unit was facing, and then the episode goes on to tell that story. It was also very effective that, when the series was filmed in 2001, none of the actors, with the exception of David Schwimmer, were well known. You didn't watch it thinking, &#34;this is Brad Pitt playing a guy in Easy Company&#34;. You didn't recognize the faces, so that made it easier for the actors onscreen to &#34;become&#34; the men they were playing in the viewer's mind.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2G7J3P4EVUH8U	Liz Pelletier	This is by far the best portrayal I have ever seen of any World War II movie (technically it is a 10 part mini-series). So far I have only bought 2 episodes, but I have seen the whole mini-series on the History channel. My dad, two of my uncles, and my fath-in-law were in World War II. One of my uncles died on a boat from a torpedo attack. He was 19. That generation never talked about their experiences. I finally got my father to tell me some of his part when he was about 85. I called him up on Veteran's Day, saying that I wanted to thank a vet for his sacrifice. He was so touched that he started to open up about some things . He's in Heaven now, but I'm so glad that I did that. One year I did the same thing with my brother who was in Vietnam. He was very surprised and thanked me, but he really does not want to talk about it. That's okay with me. Just a chance to tell him I love him. The one thing I absolutely loved about Band of Brothers was how the actual vets talked about themselves, their fears, their love for our great country at the beginning of each episode. Dick Winters (played by Damion somebody, who is actually British, but you would never know it), was or is a great man. I'm not sure if he is still alive(the real Dick Winters). So many good actors. The language is the only thing that made me cringe. I'm sure that's how it really was. It still gets a 5 star rating from me.	5.0	Review of Band of Brothers	2013-12-07	1	1	0

I have not read the book it is based upon, so I cannot comment on its faithfulness to the book.  There are specific episodes that I believe are outstanding.  The one where Easy Company is in the Argonne Forest, I believe. I suppose what makes this series appealing is its honesty and its basis on actual events and people, unlike Saving Private Ryan.  Like Black Hawk Down, these are real people experiencing real events.  There are no throw away ( the moral quandry of war) characters like ""Oppen"" (sp?) in Saving Private Ryan.  It's the real thing.  My only regret about this miniseries is that it premiered on the Sunday night, September 9th, just before the Islamic terror attacks on the US.  Perhaps it was coincidence, but the themes of good fighting evil, of free people fighting to free others, rings oh so true and timely."	5.0	Better then Saving Private Ryan	2002-12-02	5	4	1

Steven  Spielberg and Tom Hanks produced this magnificent show based upon the incredible book written by Stephen Ambrose.  This true story chronicles the experiences of the men in easy company of the 101st Airborne division during WWII.  The show begins at boot camp and takes you all the way to D-day and then to Hitler's lair at the end  of the war.  The acting, special effects, video quality, sound quality, charachter development, writing, and direction are equal to the best hollywood has ever produced, for the big screen or small screen.  It is an incredible journey; one that I will never forget.  There is a documentary at the end where they interview surviving members of easy company.  I literally had tears in my eyes as I listened to these heroic and humble men tell of their experiences.	5.0	best mini-series in the history of Television	2005-08-01	2	2	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A53ZILYRKPA1P	LM	At first glance, I wasn't sure if the series was going to be a letdown because I thought it was a mistake to cast David Schwimmer as Captain Herbert Sobol (in charge of training the 101st) - but he pulls off the performance, if not barely in my opinion.  However, I immediately connected with Damian Lewis as Major Richard Winters and the rest of the crew. Once you are into the 3rd episode, I didn't really think much about Schwimmer and started to really enjoy the series. For me, there was a real joy in seeing the vets of Easy Company give a brief introduction at the beginning of most episodes on what they were thinking and you can still see in their eyes that most will never heal the deep wounds that a war like that brings. Each episode builds to the end and before you know it, you are forming bonds with most of the actors. Near the end, I found myself wanting it to go further on for a few more episodes (maybe one episode showing what it was like to go home and adjusting back to civilian life). There are some brief slow spots in the series, but overall the time seems to pass quickly and there are some memorable scenes you are wanting to see (battle of the bulge, discovery of a concentration camp, etc).  At the end of the series, I found myself wanting to go back and rewatch all the dvd's again and I think that is my test of whether this was a great series. Enough said - one of the best TV shows that I've ever seen and will probably ever see on the relationships you build with your team when you are in battle.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2PNDUWNLGQH93	L. SCHMITZ	This is by far one of the most historically accurate and well done dramas about WWII. Stephen Ambrose is a great writer. The comraderie of the men and the personal struggles they faced was very engaging. You can't wait until the next episode. Damien Lewis's protrayal of Mack Winters is phenomenal. You really like him, sympathize with him, root for him and admire him all at the same time.I love the commentary by the actual soldiers the drama portrays. The extra material helps you understand military terms and concepts.This is a refreshing contrast to see our men in uniform protrayed as the heroes and liberators that they are rather than the slanted view shown by the mainstream media.The only negative: Would caution anyone buying it for class room use that one of the DVD's (last one?) contains a rather graphic nude sex scene. It is the only one of its kind in the entire series. Could have done without it.(Female reviewer.)	5.0	Wish I could give it 6 stars-not just another war movie	2008-06-09	1	1	0

If the US did not save Europe who did?  Was it the Russians, the French, the German&#146;s?  I forgot the German&#146;s where conquering Europe.  Ireland, who did HELP save Europe?  Any way, I am thankful and grateful for all who fought to free Europe and the rest of the countries in this world.  I am a naturalized citizen and retired member of the Arm Forces of the USA, who with out their  sacrifices I would have not been able to come to this great, wounderful, and giving nation I call my home.  It also shows the stupidity of the leadership of all nations, but most of all it shows the prize that Americans paid for the freedom we have today.  God bless all those who fight for freedom.

Truly a phenomenon in TV production. Exciting, insightful, and terribly true, this tells the story of Easy Company, from their training to the end of the war. This is the ultimate supplement to those ""Saving Private Ryan"" fans, but more than that, it's a remarkable docudrama (though most of it is in movie form) that teaches about the reality of war in one of the most gut-wrenching and true-to-life ways. I'm sure it's been said before, but let me reiterate: this is the greatest TV miniseries of all time. Costing over $100 million, this is a film that movie lovers and collectors should not pass over.

The lives of the men of the ""Band of Brothers"" are explained for all of us to question just which of these men led the life I would have had I been in that era. The closeness Ambrose explained of each individual in the book to the way he was portrayed on film is wonderful. I was in each battle and felt for each man in his own situation.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A15R1X6HP6TZSI	Mac Riddel	This is the best mini-series I have ever seen period.  I spent way too many hours watching the DVD format, and once the Blu-Ray became available, it was almost like watching a brand new 10-part movie.  The images are just incredible and the action appears to be much more, er, gritty in HD.  In a good way!If you enjoyed Saving Private Ryan, you'll probably enjoy this mini-series twice as much.  They don't pull any punches or follow typical Hollywood story lines.  It really shows how dangerous WWII was, but also how the paratroopers went above and beyond to help defeat the Germans.  The actors did an outstanding job in their roles and it's always fun to see Peter from OfficeSpace in a serious role and getting a cameo from Simon Pegg was a treat too.This was the last war where the two sides were distinct and the firepower near equal and both sides fought bravely in the face of uncertainty.  This is only the story of the 101st Airborne, but gives us an accurate glance into the struggles that WWII vets once faced.	5.0	Owned the DVD - Loved it.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A27EDZNMPLJTT7	MadMax	I previously owned the DVD version of BOB (which I believe is the finest war mini-series ever created), and was debating on whether or not to re-purchase something I already own (granted it was on BD). I was a bit concerned that due to the way BOB was shot (dull color hues, and grainy filter) that it would not benefit much from Blu-Ray.Conclusion: For a lover of the BOB series this is a must buy! The video has been noticeably enhanced, mostly noticeable by improved color contrast and a sharper picture. As for the sound... spectacular! One of the few knocks I had on the original DVD release was the audio during certain dialog... that has been fixed, and the uncompressed HD surround audio is fantastic (noticeably better than its DVD counterpart)! The extras have been getting somewhat poor reviews. I believe a lot of this is due to the fact that there isn't A LOT new.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1SSW87MFJDKGF	Makemeasoldier	This series was excellent and HBO did a very good job all this movie contains is history. They were all apart of the 101st airbourne infantry division and they did alot in WW2. I think this is all the more greater because it is on DVD. You have to like that the sound and picture quality that comes with DVD instead of watching VHS where you have to worry about tracking and the picture stinking. If you can get a surround sound system, because it will knock you off your socks.	5.0	Awsome Series	2002-08-08	2	1	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AQG8IJT2Z69BH	Malcolm	Band of Brothers greatly exceeded my expectations. I watched it for the first time this year (2014), and found it to still be one of the most entertaining TV series ever. The rich history, exceptional acting, and charming cinematography came together to tell a greatly compelling story about World War II. Through the experiences of American paratroopers in Easy Company, I learned both the excitement and anxiety that came from war.All the while, Band of Brothers never ceased to entertain either. Combining elements of action, suspense, and drama created a very addictive series. Every episode left me wanting to watch just one more.One 'problem' I had with the series was that it was difficult to follow who all the characters were; it took me almost half the series to sort that out. However, I actually think this added to demonstrating the chaos of the war setting.	5.0	Still one of the best TV series ever	2014-06-03	1	1	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2TBMX78M7PD5T	"Malvolio ""scott15724"""	"Band of Brothers is an HBO original series, based on the book of the same name by historian Stephen Ambrose. It is the true story of a company of American warriors in World War II - E (Easy) Company of the 506th Infantry Regiment, a component of the famed 101st Airborne Division. Band of Brothers is based in large part on the accounts of surviving members of that group. It follows the men of Easy Company from their gruelling training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, through their airborne drop into France on D-Day; their involvement in Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge (where they gained great notoriety as the ""battered bastards of Bastogne""); their conquest of Hitler's Eagle's Nest; and the end of the war.If you've seen Stephen Spielberg's fictional World War II epic Saving Private Ryan, you already have some inkling of the horror and constant peril accompanying the allies' assault on Fortress Europe in 1944. Ambrose's true account of the remarkable soldiers of the 101st Airborne will leave you wondering how any of these fellows survived at all. That they not only survived but achieved victory is a tribute to their training and their hardihood, but most of all their devotion to one another. The title is based on Henry Plantagenet's battlefield oration to his outnumbered and beleaguered men on St. Crispian's Day in Shakespeare's Henry V:""He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named, and rouse him at the name of Crispian. He that shall live this day, and see old age, Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours, and say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:' Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day....'This story shall the good man teach his son; and Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by, from this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remember'd - we few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he to-day that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother....""Band of Brothers is permeated by that same sense of comradeship through shared danger - of glory based not on conquest but on the loyalty of ordinary men one to another. Saving Private Ryan alumni Spielberg and Tom Hanks are the Executive Producers of the 11-episode HBO series, and Hanks is the Executive Director as well (in which capacity he directed one episode, co-wrote another, and closely oversaw the whole production). Spielberg's influence is evident in the look and feel of the work; but where Saving Private Ryan is austere and ultimately repelling, Band of Brothers is warmer, more accessible - more personal. One of the most successful features of the series is that each episode begins with reminiscences of one or more survivors. As the series progresses, you come to know these old guys and like them enormously. When the whole thing is over, you feel you really have seen the war through their eyes.""We sweated bullets in order to achieve authenticity,"" Hanks said in an interview with the BBC. ""There are two types of authenticity. What's relatively easy to accomplish are things like making sure the buttons on the uniforms are right, the ammunition is correct and the locations look like they looked in the photograph. The thing that's much harder is the motivation and the nature of the interplay between the characters. So we were always forcing every moment of every page of the script through this sieve of authenticity. We said, 'look, if we can't be sure what they said and did at any given moment, we must at least capture the emotional reality of being there.""Successful acting in a miniseries, especially one as long as this one, is really a different enterprise than in a two-hour production at the cineplex. Dynamism and inventiveness are less important to a performance than subtlety and sustained character development. (Do you really want to watch a dozen hours of Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth? Didn't think so.) Judged by that standard, the performances in Band of Brothers are very fine indeed. Damian Lewis, the young British actor who stars as Captain (later Major) Richard Winters, painstakingly reveals a new facet of Winters' adamantine character with each successive episode. In the role of battalion intelligence officer Lewis Nixon, Ron Livingston beautifully portrays Nixon's gradual descent into despair and alcoholism. Supporting performances of note include Donnie Wahlberg as Carwood Lipton, Frank John Hughes as Bill Guarnere, and Rick Gomez as George Luz. The miniseries' other production values - soundtrack, effects, cinematography, constumes, etc. - are likewise top notch.There are a few flaws in the series. The earlier episodes in particular sometimes drag a bit. There is also a tendency from time to time to toss in a little melodrama, some small ""moment"" that is the war movie equivalent to the rising organ notes at the end of a 60s soap opera. Generally, though, the filmmakers resist such temptations to yank on the heartstrings. That is especially appreciated in parts like episode 9, ""Why We Fight,"" in which Easy Company stumbles across a concentration camp for the first time. The encounter is handled with a degree of restraint that makes the shock and enormity of the discovery all the more affecting..."	5.0	The Real Deal	2002-10-17	30	28	2

Easy Company of 506 Infantry Regiment of the 101st airborne division is the most widely recognized. This is the story of D-Day. The day that would mark the beginning of the end for Hitler. Capt. Winters, Second Lieutenant Lipton, Sgt. Marlarkey, Sgt. Guarnere, Babe Heffron, just to name a few, have trained together for the paratrooper position of D-Day attack. This was the first time paratroops were used. These men volunteered for this. Band of Brothers takes you through their training up to the end of the war. The closeness that soldiers acquire during times like this is amazing. You're taken through the battles they fought, the heartbreak of comrades lost, and the power of brotherhood during dire times. Before each episode, the real soldiers talk a little of their experiences. At the end, I almost forgot this happened 70 years ago. You really connect with the &#34;characters&#34;.

Within the 101st it focuses on Easy Co. From D-Day to Operation Market-Garden, to taking of the Eagle's Nest I enjoyed every last minute of this series. The acting and directing of this series was amazing. The 5-time Emmy Winner Band of Brothers, had great acting by Damian Lewis (Maj. Richard Winters), Ron Livingston (Capt. Lewis Nixon), Frank John Hughes (Staff Sgt. Bill Guarnere), David Schwimmer (Capt. Herbert Sobel), and Donnie Wahlberg (2nd Lt. Carwood Lipton), just to name a few. Directing by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg was amazing as usual. The special affects in this movie were great. From  Bastonge to Berlin it looked like I was in the war.

While they watched in rapt attention, eyes fixed upon the screen, I found my mind wandering and bordom setting in.  I was more than content with missing the remaining 9 episodes of the series, opting instead to read in the corner.  Just recently, I decided to revisit the men of Easy Company, this time the the form of Stephen Ambrose's book.  Immediatly I fell in love with the story and the characters, I breezed through the book, hardly able to put it down.  After rewatching the mini-series, I realized what I was to young to realize three years ago, the sheer brilliance of these DVD's.  Just as good as the book, amazing as so many adaptations fall far short of the mark, it is primarily an interesting and heartwrenching series, although very informative as well.

Each 1 is perfectly cast in their respective roles. With each episode, comes a different director (with Tom Hanks directing 1 as well), but the series is seemless in it's story telling.If you haven't seen this GREAT achievement yet, please do yourself (and the Soldiers this story portrays) a service, and watch it form beginning to end, in a sitting.	5.0	Pehaps the best viewing time I've ever spent...	2004-11-22	2	1	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2H8FCXPZODZ6R	Matthew Kuzava	Reading through a few of the previous reviews, I have to wonder if we were watching the same film.  This is the antithesis of the &quot;glorifacation of war&quot;.  Boys in the prime of their lives die for no other reason than they took their helmet off to scratch their head.  This is one of the most accurate representations of the insanity of modern warfare outside of Das Boot.  Interestingly enough, Band of Brothers takes the opposite track that Das Boot took.  The one failing of this movie is at displaying the tedium that accompanied the terror of battle.  While I say this is a &quot;failing&quot;, it's not really.  I don't see how showing the tedium would add anything to this movie, it would simply distract people from the specatcle unfolding infront of them.  World War II was a horrific experiance.  The men who fought and died in the fields of Europe or the jungles of Asia faced a task that we cannot even fathom in 2004.  To say this movie glorifies war is to say that Schindlers List was a heroic propaganda piece for the Jews, it shows that same level of ignorance.  This war was forced upon these young men, and Band of Brothers is a wonderful depiction of how they overcame it.  While I do not envy these men, I have more respect for them than words can express, and this film is a fitting tribute to the sacrifice they made for freedom and sanity in this world.  It also serves as a lesson as to just how much war is to be avoided, but knowing that War has been historically unavoidable, it makes me feel better to know that men like those that populated Easy Company would be fighting for me.	5.0	A monumental masterpiece of cimematic art	2004-04-13	4	3	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3AIPVZS5XTNC9	Matthew Smith	"This is an amazing series and well worth the imposing price.  The quality of the film and the acting are outstanding!  There is drama as well as realism.Unfortunately, there is a sort of tunnel vision which afflicts the entire series.  I understand that it is seen through the eyes of one specific company and its surrounding regiment and division, but the average American viewer could easily watch this series and form the impression that this division (or maybe special types of troops such as paratroops or rangers) won WWII for the good ol' USA.  This is especially true if one watches this series with the other Spielberg\Hanks Collaboration- Saving Private Ryan.  I don't mean to split hairs or detract from the incredible bravery of these men, but unfortunately in over-glorifying one unit in a country that learns history through exposure to popular culture, the greater accomplishments of other less glamorous types is sad.The untold truth is (and there is a passing mention of them as ""doggies"" in BoB) that the leg infantryman who slugged it out in the ETO made possible our victory as did his counter parts in the forgotten Armored Divisions- SIXTEEN of which fought in Europe.  The 101st was not alone in Bastogne!!!  A combat command of the 10th Armored Division was there with them.  Why are they NEVER mentioned?  The only picture we see of regular infantry in BoB is rag tag soldiers retreating through the bulge in a daze.  Leg infantry divisions suffered upwards of 250% casualties after being committed to combat.  Divisions like the 1st,3rd,4th,9th,28th and 29th suffered between 150-250% casualties and were almost never taken out of the line- unlike the much vaunted ""elite"" 101st. Just don't forget the hundreds of thousands of ""doggies"" who went through the meatgrinders of the hedgerows and the Huertgen."	4.0	10th Armored Division?	2003-05-25	17	4	13
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1ET1NZ7QZKN6M	Matthew Tundermann	I'm not going to break down the series, episode by episode.  If you want a review of each episode, you should read K. Wyatt's review.  All I want to say is this series was probably THE best WWII drama I've seen to-date.  From bootcamp to the end of the war, the series takes you along with Easy Company and puts you right in the middle of the action with them as they jump into Normandy, fight through the hedgerows, take part in Operation Market-Garden, and even deal with the inactivity and boredom of post-war occupation.  Along the way, the story takes on some very potent issues, including the liberation of concentration camps.The comradery between the men of Easy company is touching.  I like how each episode keyed in on a different Easy Company member or a few different members.  I love the pre-episode interviews with the actual members of Easy.  And the post-series look into the Easy company survivors and their yearly reunions is also a treat.This series definitely does not pull any punches.  In the mold of Saving Private Ryan, Hanks does not shy away from the brutality of war.  Besides actually going to France and walking the beaches and other areas of Normandy (which I've done), this series is about as close as you're going to get to experiencing WWII.Definitely an instant classic of a film series.	5.0	Doesn't pull any punches	2005-11-02	4	2	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2781MTDUFHXNR	"""maximus71"""	This miniseries is,by far, the greatest war epic ever produced.It thoroughly represents the horrors of war based on first hand experiences and puts you in the middle of the action. However, contrary to what some people believe, this is not necessarily an anti-war epic. I think it says to us that war is something that should NEVER be taken lightly and in most cases should be avoided, but sometimes,regrettably, is necessary.This is one of those cases.Considering Steven Speilberg was involved in this as well as Schindlers List...I am sure he feels this way.Finally,this film also represents that the men who fought on the allied side were,in the truest sense of the word,HEROES!	5.0	Quite simply the greatest war epic ever .............PERIOD!	2002-09-02	2	2	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AFJCOP0GKZH6C	M. B. Trapp	"It's a shame that it took me over two years to watch all ten episodes of this mini-series, as it turned out to be (in my opinion) one of the best thing made for TV (albeit cable) in a long time. I got this DVD set for Christmas in 2002 after having read Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name. The book and the mini-series chronicles the story of one of the most decorated and battle-hardened infantry companies of World War 2 as they participate in the European campaign. The book is brilliant as a work of historical scholarship that tells an important story, and the mini-series is brilliant because it's a fantastic work of film (TV?) that tells that same important story. Highlights are the episode directed by Tom Hanks and one of the final episodes that recounts Easy Company's first discovery of a concentration camp. There has been a recent resurgence in the public's awareness of the achievements of this ""greatest generation,"" and for these men it couldn't have come any sooner. The mini-series doesn't try to over-lionize them, but instead paints them as normal people caught up in extraordinary events, exhibiting all their various virtues and vices. Neither does it paint them with the brush of later days, but shows them as they were: flawed heroes that accomplished something truly great for humanity."	5.0	The definitive WW2 film experience and a fitting tribute	2005-04-11	7	7	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2G6TCYKUKGEAL	M. Cadwell	I got BOB from Amazon on Blu-Ray. Bottom line: If you are even reading this page, you MUST buy it. It is simply stunning. On Blu-Ray, the gritty, realistic feel of the camera, along with filters and colors that are used to film BOB just pop out at you. This isn't going to be crystal clear in the sense that Wall-E or some other animated movies are clear in Blu-Ray. This is clear in the sense that you really feel what the director was trying to achieve with the shots.The sound IS something from out of this world. Watching it in DTS Master Audio (lossless) was a serious treat. If nothing else, buy this to show off your home theater by turning on the Battle of the Bulge episode.As far as the quality of the show, nothing competes. You get attached to the characters, you feel their joys and their pains.

What was truely suprising was that there wasn't really anything more in the book, they really managed to put it all on screen. You never really understand what war is like without living it, but when you see something like this you can at least grasp a bit more of it. Unlike Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, etc. This story is of the unit not a few people. There's no one person carring the narative, no BS story of the Bad Commander VS the Good Commander, no Private Gommer on the can eating a shotgun blast, no Tom Hanks dying ever-so-sadly to save a guy who doesn't want to be saved.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3MMO29U1KI8RF	M. D. D.	As you can see by all of the other reviews here, this is a must buy. Band of Brothers is the best World War II film I have ever seen, period! Superb acting, directing and writing. The bonus footage of the World War II veterans is both gripping and emotional. The camera work is amazing as well has it has an intentional grainy 40's feel to it. This is a truly astonishing achievement. The series is five stars all the way but let me nitpick a little. The video quality on these discs are on par with the top tear blu-ray movies out there. The picture sharpness and detail is amazing though it does have a gritty look to it which is intentional and is no problem at all. However, there is apparant noise on certain scenes of each disc, mainly in darker shot scenes which may be incode related. This is a minor nickpick and I didn't find it distracting while watching the series. Let me stress again, this is minor nickpicking as I am very picky about video and audio quality. This series does look amazing. Bottom line: This is a must buy for casual fans and hardcore fans alike.	4.0	Band of Brothers is a must buy!	2008-12-20	14	5	9

Fifteen minutes into the first disc and I was hooked.  Rarely has a war movie made me care more for what happen to the characters than the battle scenes.  The miniseries was superbly directed, acted and edited.  Even more impressive is the fact that it based on true characters and events.

Almost didn't buy it (It's pretty expensive), but rationalized the purchase somehow-- as much as you can do, walking out of the video store with a tin can full of DVD's. I gotta agree with a previous reviewer that this is one of the best purchases of this kind that we've made. It's that good. At the end you'll know each soldier by name.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3JNSFPT30TAA2	Michael Bush	This movie is not about the glorification of war. It's not even about the glorification of the American efforts in Europe. This movie is about a group of extremely young men gathered up from every walk of life and thrust into one of the most difficult situations imaginable. They were forced to kill and be killed. This movie is about innocence lost and the hollow shells left behind. I for one think this movie accomplishes this point spectacularly.And to all the amateur historians posting negative reviews about the accuracy of this film, please get one thing straight: If it weren't for the thousands of Americans who fought and died in Europe, the Third Reich would most likely still be in existence.  The English were fighting valiantly and had, for the most part staved off invasion, but would have never been able to pull off a counter-attack without the Americans. The Russians were about to be conquered, and if it weren't for the second front created by the Americans and English, probably would have been crushed. The rest of mainland Europe was either conquered in a matter of days, or collaborating with the Germans. Sure there were underground resistance movements in many countries like France and Norway that contributed greatly to the efforts of the allies, but does anyone believe for an instant they could have made a difference on their own?So before you start a righteous rant about what American soldiers did in the heat of battle or the way an American film portrays the war, visit the cemeteries at Normandy and kneel down before each and every cross or Star of David to thank that man profusely for the sacrifice he made for the life you live today.One more point, related specifically to the individuals complaining about the American-centric stance of this movie: when a European studio wants to make a film about their catastrophic collapse when German tanks rolled up, more power to them. This is our movie. We know what our grandfathers did for you and we don't care what you think.	5.0	Exemplary film	2004-04-09	7	6	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1D6PWUMDY9F7V	"Michael DENNISUK ""cc coach"""	"I rented this remarkable series over the last month. It was incredible. The acting is outstanding, the writing follows and fleshes out Mr. Ambrose's fine work. The use of the real men to introduce each episode provides us with the proper back drop - this is a real story about real men. It follows the men from jump school through the end of the war. I found the last episodes the most moving. The final Disc brings it all together with the interviews of the men of Easy Company.  The 101st Airborne was decorated as a unit for their heroic efforts at Bastogne.The final line of the disc (I believe it is delivered by Major Winters) says it all. "" 'My grandson asked were you a hero in the war grandpa? '  and I replied '  no but I served with a company of heroes'""."	5.0	A Superior Achievement	2003-09-03	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2BON03VAFS1SZ	Michael Fishman	"Band of Brothers is the HBO miniseries adaptation of Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name that detailed the actions of the 101st Airborne Division's Easy Company during World War II. The story starts during paratrooper training and takes us to D-Day and Bastogne and eventually to the end of the war. I don't know how the miniseries holds up against the book, but as a stand alone series, this is some great stuff and is about as close to ""must see"" television as possible. The drama of individual characters is sacrificed for the drama of the war itself so this is no star vehicle for any one actor and the stories of the soldiers themselves are never brought into the plot. The tension in the battle scenes is palpable and because of their realism, they're very difficult to watch.Congratulations to Stephen Spielberg, Tom Hanks and HBO. This is about as close to perfect as anything on the screen can be. Each episode starts with some brief comments by actual members of Easy Company and each episode ends with a brief written summary of what was happening in the war after the time frame of the episode. The inclusion of these two pieces helped frame each episode beautifully.Please don't turn away from Band of Brothers because you don't like war movies because this is an amazing series that goes beyond being ""just"" another war story. As the title implies, this is ultimately the story of soldiers, ordinary men in an extraordinary situation, who live through, and deal with, some horrible situations and how they cope and survive and become really more than brothers. It's also an easy-to-swallow history lesson.I'm still going to hold out on I, Claudius being the best miniseries ever made, but Band of Brothers is right up there. My only complaints with the series was that I would have liked more individual character development of the soldiers and I felt that it was assumed the viewer had at least basic knowledge of the events being covered in each episode which seemed a little unfair to some viewers. However, the Field Guide in the DVD extras and the performances of Donnie Wahlberg, David Schwimmer and Neal McDonough (three actors I've never cared for before seeing them here, but who all turned in brilliant performances) were enough to counter any small complaints I may have had.Recommended for everyone with the caveat that this miniseries contains scenes of very graphic violence and intense combat action.Also recommended for anyone interested in movies about some of the events covered in the miniseries are Battleground (1949) and The Longest Day (1962) and A Bridge Too Far (1977)."	5.0	Not just another war story	2011-02-14	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1U0QSDR7T41XQ	Michael G	Ok there is no doubt that this is a great series and deserves a 5 star rating. this will be a review of the format (blu-ray) not the content.This show is stunning in Blu-ray. the clarity of this show in HD compared to regular television is amazing. also the DTS suround sound is wonderful. durring many of the scenes it puts you in the action. now the bluray version does have some qwerks. first you will want to update your blu-ray player. really simple just hook it up to the internet and click the update in the menu. the first time i tried the first episode it would not load right. after i did about a 30min update with my Samsung Bluray player it ran fine. my friend has one fo those cheap insignia ones (i think its insignia) anyways his will freeze up after watching more then an hour or two, his also takes forever to load but i am sure that is only his Bluray player because on my nice Samsung on it works amazing and flawless. i would recomend that if you are like me that once i put one in i could be watching this show for the next 10 hours i would get it on bluray only if you have a good bluray player, (one that cost over 400 dollars and made in the past year) if you have one of those cheap Blu-ray players i would get the DVD version and use your player to up convert it. the up converted DVD is close to the Bluray in quality and the DVD loads alot better and easier. Personally i own both versions and with my 500 dollar samsung blu ray player i only watch the bluray version, the picture is amazing. the DVD version i have not played in probably a month i might give it to a friend.Oh yeah also if you dont have a 1080 HDTV dont bother getting anything in bluray. an upconverted DVD on a 1080 is clearer then any bluray on a 720. With a 720 an upconverted DVD is as good as you will get so there is no need to spend the more money on a bluray and this goes for any bluray disc not just this show. thats just from personal exsperiance. my friend might have 3 inches on my 37 in but mines a 1080 and his 40 is a 720. i wont ever get a 720 no matter how cheap and big it is, with HD its jsut not worth it.	5.0	Blue Ray version review	2008-12-31	4	1	3

Also consider Saving Private Ryan,which is about the water borne landing at Normandy.

"Band of Brothers takes us from Boot camp through the great battles of the European Theater of operations to the final Victory against Hitler's Third Reich. Along the way, we see these Band of Brothers (from Shakespeare's famous speech in Henry V - ""We few, we happy few, we band of brothers..."") as land at Normandy, weather the onslaught of Bastogne, cross into Germany, liberate a concentration camp and finish their tour of duty in Victory.Each man is carefully studied archetype in American society from the tough mouthed city boys to more buoyant Midwestern toughs. The new officers must suffer the looks and doubts of the experienced dogfaces while the veteran officers must fulfill their missions - all the while dreading the loss of men that they have come to know and respect. We feel their hopes and dreams. We hope that they live to fulfill these dreams.In perilous times such as the present fight against terrorism this DVD set is a fitting introduction and education that the threat of National Socialism and Radical Islam requires our attention, devotion and sacrifice now and for the Next Generation.Watch the show with your family, including the children old enough to understand.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A198MMI0U6I19T	Michael P. Bucci	No matter your feelings on war, and the settling of conflict through military might, this is one of the most important pieces of film to ever be produced.  At a time when the brave men and women of the greatest generation are quickly dying off, this production stepped in to ensure that their sacrifices and contributions to peace are never forgotten.Unlike Pearl Harbor which was overly romanticized, and the Thin Red Line which was little more than a collection of cameos by major stars in a vain attempt to emulate Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers takes a collection of relatively unknown talent and tells the story of one group of soldiers through the European campaign.  The fact that the actors are relatively unknown allows you to focus on the story and see them as the characters they protray rather than Hollywood marquee actors playing their latest role and attempting to live up to their own hype.While this collection is expensive, it is a small price to pay to ensure that children of today are well versed in this important period of history, especially since they are not getting it in their schools.	5.0	No family should be without this DVD	2002-11-08	1	1	0

Expound tenfold upon such an emotion, and that's what the entire final episode is like; you've grown to enjoy the characters so intensely that simply the knowledge of this miniseries' end is heartbreaking.Now... remember that these aren't 'characters' -- they are actual people.This isn't pure fantasy -- it's a recreation of actual events.Band of Brothers is so eloquently presented, so dynamically directed and produced, that I cannot watch this without feeling displaced. Every aspect of this series is crafted painstakingly,  from the casting choices to the actors' performances to the glimpses of ""things you've always heard about"" to sets and locations which completely immerse you in the storylines; this is a must-have for anybody interested in war movies, WWII, history... or just plain ol' good drama. Feel free to keep a copy of Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down nearby, in case you get inspired.  ;o)The only drawback? It comes in a nice metal case... and mine was dented during delivery, without option for an exchange.

This is the greatest World War..wait..WAR movie of all times. Split into diffenerent episodes so you can see a viewpoint from different soldiers, you begin the bond with the mean of Easy Company from episode one. This has very gory scenes in some parts, but the thing that makes it so realistic is how the actors react. I love the actors in this movie. They act like they were in the real war.Believe me, I though Saving Private Ryan was the best war movie ever, but, nevermind that.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A31C0OR9OQ73K	Mike	"There's already enough reviews out there regarding this epic mini-series, so I won't go into details here. I will mainly focus on this Blu-ray package instead.My cousin owned the DVD version of Band of Brothers and I borrowed it, watched it, and loved it when it first released many years ago. So when the Blu-ray version released, I decided to buy it and watch it ASAP. I was immediately reminded of the super-high production value, special effects, quality acting, story-telling, realism, attention to details, engrossing sound, and emotional aspects that made this mini-series so good.The Blu-ray version is definitely worth the purchase for anyone wanting to experience one of the best mini-series ever filmed and arguably, the best on-screen depiction of World War II... ever. I was amazed at the picture quality and sound. Most Parts (episodes) have highly-detailed, crisp, and clear images. The only instance where I found some ""graininess"" was during the bombardment Easy Company received during Part 7: The Breaking Point. However, this was probably an intended artistic decision choice made by the director and not an issue with the film itself. I personally didn't find it a problem, but I thought I should mention it here. Besides those scenes, most of the episode had near-perfect PQ on a 1080p display.The sound is just awesome. I don't have a good enough sound system to take advantage of the DTS-HD Master Audio feature, but I do have a system that supports regular DTS audio. You will feel like you're actually there on the battlefield with Easy Company if you turn up the volume, trust me.The only minor complaint I have is the fact that it takes a while to load up each disc. You have to sit through all the warnings, brief ""HBO Video"" introduction (can't skip), and loading session each and every time you pop a disc in. I haven't timed it, but I estimate that it takes roughly 2 minutes to actually view the first episode each disc (2 episodes per disc, 10 episodes total).The metallic box it comes packaged in is sturdy, just like the DVD version. It is slightly smaller and shaped slightly differently compared to the DVD box, but is very similar to it.Overall, this is a must-buy product for anyone that likes this genre. If you own a Blu-ray player, you need to get your hands on this boxed set NOW."	5.0	Amazing Picture Quality, Amazing Sound, Amazing Mini-series	2008-11-27	12	10	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AYKK22KZ3QYFR	Mike K	I really enjoyed this series when it ran on HBO, but poor quality control has made it impossible for me to find a good set of Blu-rays of this series.  I have purchased Band of Brothers in Blu-ray twice, once from Amazon and then again from another vendor.  I had to return both sets for the very same reason. This is a 6 disc set.  In both cases, discs 1 and 6 played on my Blu-ray player, but discs 2 through 5 simply played a message that I was attempting to play them on a player from an incompatible region.  I can't imagine why HBO has not recalled these defective sets.  I'm reluctant to purchase another set because, even though the discs that worked were great, I don't want to go to the bother of returning yet another set if the problem hasn't been fixed.  I have many Blu-ray discs and this is the only time something like this has happened (and it happened twice)!  I'm surprised that the reviews don't contain more complaints about this situation.	1.0	Mixed Disc Coding	2009-12-11	59	13	46

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3IB1W0SVED0Z3	"Mike Powers ""mkp51"""	"In September 2001, only a few days before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, there began on the Home Box Office (HBO) cable network one of the most extraordinary television mini-series I have ever seen. Entitled ""Band of Brothers,"" that mini-series told in dramatic fashion and with exquisite eloquence the true story of one of the most famous and highly decorated U.S. Army units to fight during World War II: Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. In 2002,  ""Band of Brothers"" was released DVD; in 2008 a six-disc Blu-ray edition was published, and now it is available on Amazon Instant Video in high definition digital format.For those not familiar with ""Band of Brothers,"" it's based upon the equally outstanding book entitled ""Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest,"" by the late Stephen E. Ambrose.  It describes in stunning detail the exploits of Easy Company, from its initial airborne landing in Normandy on D-Day; through its participation in Operation Market-Garden in September 1944 and its tenacious defense of Bastogne in December 1944; to its capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden in April 1945.The original HBO mini-series is divided into ten episodes, each about one hour long. The entire project - which cost an estimated $125 million to produce - has as its executive producers Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Stephen Ambrose.With such cinematic luminaries leading the production team, one would expect ""Band of Brothers"" to be outstanding in every respect, and it does not disappoint. Taken as a whole, the ten episodes provide a highly accurate and faithful chronology of the events narrated by Ambrose in his book, while at the same time providing viewers with superb acting, writing, cinematography, music, costumes, and sound. Taken separately, each episode stands as a powerful and gritty testament to the patriotism, heroism, and character of the men of Easy Company.It's impossible to describe with full justice how good ""Band of Brothers"" is. It is, for me, the nearly perfect war chronicle: an accurate depiction of real events; arrayed with a stellar cast, including many unknown actors who have made a name for themselves as a result of their work in this film (among them, most notably: Damian Lewis; Donnie Wahlberg, Ron Livingston; Dale Dye (who also served as the series' military advisor); Frank John Hughes; and Rick Gomez.I now own the complete ""Band of Brothers"" miniseries in three formats: DVD (purchased 2003); Blu-Ray (2011); and now in digital format through my Amazon Prime membership. I think the digital format provides the clearest, sharpest, and most vibrant audio and video of the three formats I own. I have already watched several episodes on my Kindle Fire HD, and I can say without hesitation that the experience was superb in every way. It certainly made the purchase of this series well worth the price. (Of course, if you're an Amazon Prime member, you can view ""Band of Brothers"" for free.)MY VERDICT:  No matter what format you own, ""Band of Brothers"" is truly outstanding.  Along with its sister miniseries ""The Pacific"" (2010), it is simply the best war story I've ever seen in any cinematic medium. Both ""Band of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"" deserve honored places in any home video collection."	5.0	"""Band of Brothers"" (HBO Miniseries) Truly outstanding in every respect."	2012-12-14	1	1	0

The actors are incredible and do a wonderful job of embracing their roles.  It was so easy to get involved with each character, and get heartbroken when they disappeared in a hail of bullets and mortar.  The generation of WWII vets are disappearing fast, and most great grandchildren will never know what their grandparents saw and did in the war. This series gives a great insight to the struggles and mental hardships of the men. As a grandchild of a WWII vet I can tell you I never heard my grandfather's story.  It was something he just didn't talk about.  When I would ask him what he did over there, he would only tell me he built bridges in Europe.  After seeing and hearing the stories of these soldiers I began to understand why he never spoke about it.I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in our military and their history during WWII.	5.0	Insight for the generations...	2012-01-20	2	2	0

It's as if you took everything that was great about every movie ever made about WWII and distilled it into a 10 hour epic.It's all here. The training film. The airplane/parachute jumper film. The forest/jungle combat film. The urban warfare film. The concentration camp film.You have your veteran soldiers, your newbies, heroes galore, mangled extremities, merciless firefights, harrowing escapes......seriously, it is ALL here.You will grow to love these characters. Except they're not characters.They're real guys. Just like you and me...except they're not.These are the bravest, most noble men our country has ever produced. &quot;Ordinary&quot; guys doing the most extraordinary things. It's inspiring in the way few movies ever could be.There is not one moment in the entire miniseries that feels fake or forced. It has an air of authenticity rarely encountered in this genre. Having the real guys make a few comments before each episode grounds the subsequent hour into reality. It also serves to make it all the more amazing.The acting is superb, right down the line. You will be shocked at how perfect the depiction of the actor portraying &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Guarniere is, when you see the real one in the accompanying  documentary. It is a MUST see after you finish the entire set, but wait a day or two to recover. This movie will leave you spent, and the documentary is almost a little too much to handle right afterwards.The cinematography in particular is flat out awesome. The direction, handled by several supremely capable hands, is wonderful without drawing too much attention to itself, and surprisingly consistent throughout the production. The score is haunting.Top to bottom, I don't think I've seen anything better on TV.Or elsewhere.Impressive to an overwhelming extent.	5.0	The single best cinematic depiction of war.	2004-05-13	4	4	0

This movie will make you cry, make you think, make you cheer and make you appreciate the sacrifices of a previous generation.  With all of the evil and other problems in the world today, this movie will inspire you to do what you can.

Imagine, as another reviewer has, of defending the necessity of war by bringing up the concept of &quot;Holy War.&quot;  Yup, the Crusades and religion-driven terrorism are the models we want.Yet given this defense of Ian's point of view, I have to say Band of Brothers is an *excellent* series to view as a commemoration of what soldiers in WWII had to go through, and it also can help one to *reflect* on war and its consequences, whether you're a hawk or dove.As other reviewers have noted, BoB is amazingly well made and quite faithful to Ambrose's book.  It takes a lot of the film techniques employed in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (hand held cameras, desaturating the color in some of the shots to make the scene feel more grim) to bring the shocking reality of war closer to the screen, and yet, the miniseries format allows the series to focus better on the soldiers of Easy company.  The characters come to the forefront and the special effects become a supporting player as they should be.  The series brings excellent filmmaking to the service of witnessing to these men's memories.From time to time (such as in the &quot;Why We Fight&quot; episode) there is an editorial slant towards putting the action in the context justifications for the war.  However, the main strength of this series over nearly all other war movies (over Saving Private Ryan especially) is its &quot;you are there&quot; perspective with comparatively little editorializing.  Here it is:  a chronicle of a group of soldiers' experiences.  You'll get a glimpse into the bonds between them that helped them survive, the heroics that events seemed to summon up from so many of the soldiers, and also their suffering.Where to go from there is up to you.  Are there better &quot;investments&quot; to make with such suffering and gallantry than war?  Does sympathy with such soldiers mean that anti-war activists must be pummelled for their supposed dishonor?  Yes, war will always be with us.  But so too will heroism and self-sacrifice.  I can think of no better way of honoring the sacrifices Capt. Richard Winters and Easy Company made than to watch the series and make a commitment to thinking about our ideas and images of war and sacrifice--specifically whether we're fighting the right wars and making the correct sacrifices.  Just because our servicemen are willing to risk their lives to defend our nation doesn't mean that all wars justify their sacrifices.	5.0	Great DVD to reflect on WWII	2003-12-02	10	5	5

It has excellent story lines and it has very deep and compelling characters. What sets this apart from many other war movies is that it is based on true events and actual people. It draws its concept from Stephen Ambrose's book ""Band of Brothers"". The series was a project of Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg, and they definitely out did themselves. It is truely a series not to miss, and I can assure you that you will enjoy it and treasure it. It is a 10 part series and the collection includes a must have bonus disc.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1CA1U6YAABUFR	Mmaddog	Stephen Ambrose, Writer and Historian decided to write a book on E Company 506 PIR because it was considered one of the very best companies to serve in Europe. D-Day, Operation Market Garden, the incredible stand at Bastogne, the invasion of Germany, and finally the first allied unit to arrive at Hitler's Eagles Nest. This company saw action in all these engagements and more.The book is very accurate and straight forward. Ambrose interviewed the living members of the company to get the details for the book and Stephen  Spielberg and Tom Hanks do their magic in converting the great book to create a brilliant mini series. All of the events depicted in the film are taken from the book almost word for word. It is the most historically truthful war film made about WWII that I have ever seen. The creators went to great pains and expense to get all details as close to reality as possible from the uniforms, weapons and equipment to the actual battles the company was engaged in, one after another.This is a must see for anyone who wants to see the true experiences of what the real war was like for an American GI. Awesome endeavor to undertake and is well executed. Many thanks to Spielberg and Hanks to pay tribute to the brave men who served in this magnificent company. And most of all, thanks to the men of Company E who undertook this service to our Country. The original company was made up of only volunteers.	5.0	How it really was - The American Army in WWII in the European Theater	2014-06-02	1	1	0

Yes they used real events but the characters were fake, so the emotions were therefore fake.Band of Brothers does not have this issue, when you see an event on screen and your first thought is &#34;WOW that actually happened&#34; instead of &#34;WOW this is stupid, that would never have happened.&#34;  One unique part of this mini series is that at the beginning of each episode are super quick interviews with the guys that were actually there, part of what's interesting about this is they don't tell you who they are until the last episode, so you never know who survived the war.Although it has it's issues it has aged very well for being over 10 years old now it has aged very well, although it is heart breaking to realize how many of the soldiers of Easy Company have passed away now. Remember this is the 70th anniversary  of the landings in Normandy meaning that most of Easy Company would be 91 now.This series not only focuses around the battles that Easy Company fought in but in the emotional human side of the conflict. This in turn gives my wife something to enjoy and a way to connect to this series unlike many war films.	5.0	It's like Saving Private Ryan, except this really happened!	2014-06-06	1	1	0

Not only does it tell the full story of Easy Company from formation to the end of World War 2, but it puts you into their lives, like you are actually there. I have yet to have seen a miniseries or movie this powerful. You see their transformation from boys to men. From the training in Camp Tacoa, Ga. to parachute landings behind enemy lines on D-Day, to the Battle of the Bulge, to the Nazi Prison Camps, to the capturing of Adolf Hitlers Eagles Nest in Nazi Controlled Austria. When they lose a ""brother"" you feel like you've lost a brother, when they take an obstical, you feel like you've taken that obstical with them.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2PMO6E76SR72O	M. Morgan	First off, the Blu-ray edition of this mini-series is visually stunning!  I also own the standard DVD version and there is a great difference.  In addition the DTS-HD Master audio track is excellent and brings out every sound imaginable.  Now to the series itself.  It is, in my opinion, the best mini-series ever produced for television.  Everything from the production to the acting and the writing is top notch.  I have seen Band of Brothers a minimum of 10 times and it never gets old.  It shows the sacrifices that those men made for their country and the world in a real way.  It can be exciting and moving at the same time.  From the first episode, 'Currahee', to the last 'Points', it is a captivating view.  Everyone will be moved by every episode.  In particular, the episode 'Why We Fight' shows not only the horror of the Nazis, but the compassion of our American soldiers.  The 2 episodes regarding the Battle of the Bulge would be one of the best WWII movies ever had these simply been release in that format.  Throughout the series, we see the best of the men who save the world.  We also see the faults and humanity of these same men.  This series should be required viewing in all high schools so every person can see what these men did to, in my opinion, save the world.  There are many standout performances throughout the series.  Ron Livingston (Nixon) and Damian Lewis (Winters) gave outstanding, though controlled performances.  Donnie Wahlberg's portrayal of Sgt. Lipton stands out among an excellent supporting cast.  Do yourself a favor and watch all the extras.  These give you a unique insight into the actual men on which the series is based.  This set is worth every penny and is my absolute favorite of every DVD/Blu-ray that I own.  You won't be disappointed by Band of Brothers.	5.0	An amazing homage to WWII	2008-11-23	4	3	1

It was a unique experience, but mostly interesting to me because I was able to see where the creators strayed from the book and into literary license-land, with all the facts fresh in mind.  Not that it's a bad thing to take a book to film with a few liberties here and there, but if you don't have to veer from the truth to make a phenomenal nail-biting story, good on ya.The case is well put together, albeit a little awkward to get the , but still it does stand out nicely on the shelf when other companies like Disney are putting cases together out of cardboard.  Love Wall-e and the recycled case, but it didn't hold up well to the wiles of my 2 year old.  This one ought to give her a run for her money.  Ha!The acting, directing and editing are all world-class, and each episode is put together with a little bit different theme.  Watch out for blood, one sex scene, and some healthy cursing.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1SCD2NYTIAQTY	Mouldy Pilgrim	"It is hard to find words to describe the 700 minute, 10 part epic that is ""Band of Brothers"". Following Easy Company of the US Airborne through traing, D-Day parachute landings and onto Germany, the series is a wonderfully made depiction of the events of war as the men of Easy experienced it.The series combines the filmed parts with initial interview footage of surviving members making comments related to themes in that particular part. One part, with Albert Blythe, a scared soldier, is preceded by the interview footage discussing fear and dealing with it. These excerpts leant a great deal to the overall message of the films. Each part has an overall theme that is dealt with, such as replacements and so on.The execution and making of the parts was excellent throughout. The combat scenes are filmed with cameras bobbing about, as if the cameraman is running right behind the soldiers in combat. The choice makes these scenes all the more realistic.This is not a glossed over war movie, and the scenes are graphic and what the men did may not always inspire sympathy. However flawed the men were, the depiction is honest and real, and one still admires them their bravery, humour and loyalty to each other in adversity. A particularly moving part is when ""Bull"" Randall's men go back to a German occuppied village to find him after Easy had retreated from it. Luckily, he had already been found after the Germans had left.The special features are extensive, and add even more information to the making of the series and the men who inspired it.Overall, this is without doubt an excellent series on the invasions of Europe by the Allies during World War Two. It seems long, but I have sat through it many times and still enjoy it heaps. I always seem to end it with something new from it. It is definitely worth seeing more than once."	5.0	Epic and Epic	2007-04-15	2	1	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A330FTZTW57U32	M. Rael	The effect Band of Brothers creates is sobering. Unlike Saving Private Ryan there is no hollywood window dressing in terms of the storytelling. No fake subplots written in to make you hate the enemy more. Theres actually not a strong dramatization of 'the bad guys' at all  ..its more about doing your duty and doing your job in what is probably the most stressful conditions any human being can be placed in; facing death in battle. And killing others in battle. Soldiers throughout history have faced such conditions, but in this case we see the real American character showcased. A free society will always field the strongest armies. Theres something in the DNA of human life on this planet that seems to favor that mentality- even when applied to war. Thats what shines through in Band of Brothers: the American character taking center stage, at the boots on the ground level. Freedom isnt free. Its sobering.	5.0	Easy Company	2009-01-11	0	0	0

FWIW.Update 5/10/2006I just finished watching this whole series again a second time (since 2002). My opinion is stronger than before---this is an absolutely awesome film, and to anyone reading this, if you a lover of history, especially the USA & Europe, then you must own this. Please, buy it for yourself and your children.On a personal note, I am so thankful that men such as these preceeded me and made it possible to enjoy a wonderful life here in these United States today. Surely, if there is a Heaven, a special place must be reserved there for the Easy Company.	5.0	it's almost too intense to watch	2005-11-06	4	4	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	ADR3REKQQNXQU	"Mr. Russell Brooks ""Russell1"""	At the end of the last episode of Band of Brothers, `Points', Major Richard Winters recalls a conversation one of his soldiers, Mike Ranney, had with his grandson: `Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?' Grandpa said `no - but I served in the company of heroes'. While this is an admirable sentiment on the part of Mike Ranney and Major Winters, I doubt that anyone who has watched the mini-series Band of Brothers, or read the book of the same name by renowned World War II historian, Stephen Ambrose, would agree with them on this one.On the contrary, I think one would be hard-pressed to find a single person who has watched the mini-series or read the book that would not revere Richard Winters and the other men of Easy Company, the group of soldiers that Band of Brothers is about, as incredibly courageous and indisputable heroes, who helped liberate Western Europe from the grip of the Nazis, one of the most evil and tyrannical regimes the world has ever known.The 10 episodes of Band of Brothers depict the true story of the tour of duty of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, U.S. Army during World War II, including their airborne landing in Normandy on D-Day, their liberation of Eindhoven in the Netherlands in October 1944, their discovery of a concentration camp near Landsberg in Western Germany in April 1945, the grim weeks they endured the frozen, icy Hell of the Ardennes Forest near Bastogne in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge and their capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden, the symbolic home of the 3rd Reich.The executive producers of the mini-series were Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, and the mini-series is in a similar vein to Saving Private Ryan, in its graphic and uncompromising portrayal of the horror and cruelty of battle, as well as the extraordinary bravery and comradeship.In 2002, the mini-series was nominated for numerous awards, and won some of these:- Golden Globe Award for Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television (Won)- Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television - Damian Lewis (Nominated)- Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television - Ron Livingston (Nominated)- Emmy Award for Outstanding Mini-Series (Won)- Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Mini-Series, Movie or a Special (Won)- Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Mini-Series, Movie or a Dramatic Special (Won)The above accolades are richly deserved; the casting and acting are excellent, particularly Damian Lewis' portrayal of Major Richard Winters; there is not a moment in the whole mini-series that it doesn't feel like he IS Major Winters. The performances of many of the other actors, such as Ron Livingston, Shane Taylor, Eion Bailey and Donnie Wahlberg, to name a few, are also excellent, as is the music by Michael Kamen, which adds a great deal to the emotional impact of the mini-series.While the whole mini-series is riveting, the two episodes I found the most powerful were the final two, `Why We Fight' and `Points', particularly the re-enactment of the liberation of a concentration camp in Western Germany by Easy Company in `Why We Fight'. In fact, I would say without a doubt that this is one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen on film.It is truly chilling when Major Winters asks one of the camp inmates through Joseph Liebgott, one of his soldiers who could speak German, `Joe, will you ask him what kind of camp this is, um, what uh, why are they here?' looking genuinely perplexed, and also asks whether they are criminals. Joe Liebgott replies `I don't think criminals, Sir' and then translates the inmate's response: `No. Actors, musicians, tailors, clerks, farmers, intellectuals, normal people - Jews. Poles. Poles and gypsies'. The look on Damian Lewis' face in this scene... He should have won the Golden Globe award he was nominated for on this scene alone. After all the terrible things the soldiers had seen in combat, to be so shocked and affected by what they witnessed at this camp decisively brings home how dreadful it must have been.Another of the scenes I found the most moving was the German general addressing his men near the end of the last episode, `Points': `Men, it's been a long war, it's been a tough war. You fought bravely, proudly for your country. You are a special group. We found in one another a bond that exists only in combat. My brothers, we've shared foxholes, we've known each other in dire moments. We've seen death and suffered together. And I'm proud to have served with each and every one of you. You deserve long and happy lives and peace.'It is evident that the American soldiers listening to this speech, translated by Joe Liebgott, realise that the words could have just as easily been spoken by one of their own generals, and that perhaps they are not so different to the German soldiers after all.At the end of `Points', Easy Company are informed of the unconditional surrender of the Japanese - the worst war in the history of mankind was finally over. The comments made by the surviving veterans at the end of this last episode are particularly poignant:- Edward `Babe' Heffron: `The real men, the real heroes, are the fellows that are still buried over there, and those that came home to be buried'.- Donald Malarkey: `Just brave, so brave it was unbelievable'.- Carwood Lipton: `Henry the fifth was talking to his men, and he said `From this day on until the ending of the world, we will be remembered. For he who today sheds his blood with me, shall be my brother. We in it shall be remembered; we lucky few; we band of brothers'.- And Major Richard Winters: `There is not a day that goes by that I do not think of the men I served with who never got to enjoy the world without war.'`You and your allied brethren will always be remembered, not as conquerors but as soldiers of freedom, and as the architects of peace.' - American General speaking at the Normandy premiere of Band of Brothers.	5.0	A powerful tribute to a band of heroes	2010-04-24	2	2	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2EWC48FRNO3YP	"M. Veiluva ""sputnik99"""	"""Band of Brothers"" is the most in-depth attempt by a film to depict the experience of a infantry rifleman in sustained modern combat.  It faithfully follows Stephen Ambroses' wonderful book of the same title, tracing a company of paratroopers from the training camp at Toccoa to the end of the war at Hitler's mountain retreat in the Bavarian Alps.  It benefits from an impeccable cast, modern post-Private Ryan battle effects, and incredible attention to detail.  This is a grognard's must-have.  And, like its soulmate ""Private Ryan"", due to its realism it renders most earlier and less-sophisticated WW2 films nearly unwatchable.Company E (Easy), 506th Airborne Regiment participated in the three pivotal battles of the Western European Campaign in World War II: D-Day, Market Garden (the failed attempt to seize the Rhine River crossing in Holland), and at the siege of Bastogne during Hitler's December 1944 Ardennes Offensive.  Because of their status as elite troops, the paratroopers were cold-bloodedly employed longer in battle, and against greater odds, than most equivalent units.  A point made repeatedly in the film is the enormous turnover caused by casualties, as more and more of the long-term characters we become comfortable with are wounded, killed, or incapacitated by combat stress.  Yet these troops were consistently thrown into the breach because of their reliability and lethal commitment to survive.The most valuable aspect of the film, which is not peopled by big-name actors, is in portraying the plight of line infantrymen.  The American method of waging war whether in World War II, Korea and especially Vietnam, imposed the burden of ground combat on a minority of units and individual soldiers at any given time.  What happens to these soldiers is the stuff of Band of Brothers - and if this is the fate of elite troops, one can only imagine how more standard units filled with a mix of draftees and enlisted men fared.  Ambroses's book and the movie follow the progression from the gung-ho D-Day battles to the first setback at Einhoven, and the frozen, starved soldiers torn apart by German artillery at Bastogne.  Ultimately, some of these soldiers crack, and company commanders finally refuse to take risks pre-empting higher authority.The book and film are both a ""Greatest Generation"" tribute and a lesson, in a way, a powerful anti-war statement of their own.  Ambrose's moral is that every soldier, no matter how well trained or elite, has a ""breaking point"" beyond which he or she should not be expected to endure.  The realties of modern war are such that unless the combat experience is in the context of a ""splendid little war"" such as Panama or the 1991 Gulf War, human beings were not meant to be exposed to a constant lethal environment for months on end.  Seemingly this lesson has to be re-learned in every sustained war, including the one we are now in.Must Read:  Stepehn Ambrose's ""Band of Brothers"" and related titles.  Other great related films:  ""Private Ryan"" (of course), the German films ""Das Boot"" and ""Stalingrad"", and (a possible surprise here) ""Memphis Belle."""	5.0	Lessons of War in Finest Mini-Series Ever	2005-02-24	7	7	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1IG1I6MR3HAWA	nagappa	I hate to disturb the almost perfect 5 star viewer rating, but &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is no where nearly as good as &quot;Battleground&quot; (made in 1950 and starring Van Johnson).&quot;Battleground&quot; also depicts the men of 101st Airborne division, albeit of the &quot;I&quot; Company. But, unlike &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, &quot;Battleground&quot; does not resort to mock-heroics or false philosophizing. Unfortunately, &quot;Battleground&quot; is available only on VHS.While I don't deny that both &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; are important movies from a historical perspective and that these stories are well worth telling today, I have problems with both movies depicting GIs with too modern a body language for the era, using inappropriate dialogue and idioms, and having too much &quot;attitude&quot;.In all the three episodes of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; that I watched, the acting was mostly mediocre, with the actors swaggering and giving the impression of &quot;look at me, I am a cool WWII GI&quot;. The GIs look a tad too smart for front line, the uniforms look too clean (with brushed cotton texture) and the haircuts look too perfect. The compter-generated effects are all too evident. The tracer bullets look too video-game like. In the &quot;Bastogne&quot; episode, the parachute supplies falling on Bastogne almost look cartoonish.I had a laugh with some reviewers saying &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is the best war movie, ever, period, etc., etc. To them I say get hold of copies of movie greats like &quot;The Story of GI Joe&quot;, &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot;, &quot;The Desert Rats&quot;, &quot;The Bridges of Toko-Ri&quot;, &quot;Battleground&quot;, or &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot;.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3106VD94ULBKZ	"Nathan Bauer ""Movie Man"""	I think this miniseries is very good and very powerful in a sense that you would not understand.  This is the best miniseries that was made for World War 2.  I have had see many World War 2 films but nothing that tops this.  You have not only that fact is about a company of men but it is about the famous Easy Company of the 506th and 101st airborne division.In the first episode called Currahee they have a commander named Sobel and this man is about the first man they meet in a series of commands and they meet this man Sobel.  In the next couple of episodes they start the drops on Normandy during D-Day and that episode is called the Day of Days.  Then you have a very cool episode called Carantan it is the raid on Market Garden that is episode 3 then 3 episodes later they have the infamous Battle of the Bulge.  That takes up 2 episodes of the miniseries episodes 6 and 7.  After episode 8 they get ready to come off the line and they go ahead into the forest and spot what is one of the German POW camps where they spot some stuff they do not want to see.  They find prisoners of war there and they find that they are getting killed in gas chambers and they are not being fed very well because they are all skin and bones.  After that they meet up in the final episode and raid one of Hitler's famous homes called the Eagle's Nest and finish raiding it and after that they set fire to the home and they win the war.All in all this miniseries made by HBO will get your heart going it is a very sad movie and that will make you feel bad for the men in Easy Company.	5.0	Great Miniseries on WWII	2003-04-11	3	1	2

The story of East Company, a squadron of paratroopers, from their training in boot camp to the many horrors of war. Tom Hank's acting is superb, the story compelling and realistic to the point of being painful to watch at certain times, and art direction spot on.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1IZH3213CJQEM	Nathan P Taylor	This series by HBO is almost more of a docementary than a T.V. series for entertainment.  The story-line seems very real and grabs your attention for the length of the series.  Each episode focuses on an integral part of Easy Company's journey through WWII.  At times the series focuses on boot camp, the officers, how the medics function in the heat of battle (or cold), and the relationships between soliders.  This series has a similar style to Saving Private Ryan, which I also enjoyed, but the detail seems more in depth.  This is a must-watch WWII series.	5.0	Incredible Series	2002-08-08	4	1	3
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3GFOL51VWFHGN	"Navyvet ""navyvet"""	Band of Brothers is an outstanding depiction of a company of soldiers in the 101st Airborne in World War II. It is produced in the unusually realistic style of Saving Private Ryan. The film shows the very humanistic side of war including leadership (at its best and worst), fear, suffering, courage and loyalty. The cinematography is unsurpassed.The film is one of the two best war films I have ever seen and it depicts a time in our American history which makes me well with pride for our fathers, uncles and grandfathers who proved that they could overcome their own fears to literally save the world.I have read reviews like the simplistic and sophomoric review by Ian Cooper and I am reminded of the pacifist Neville Chamberlain who sold Britain out to the early Nazi Tyranny of the war.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3TD5ZIKOPE8BP	Nicholas D. Gough	This story is one of the best ever told about the ETO and how men were able to fight and deal with themselves, each other and the horrors of war. I cannot express my feelings in the proper light with just words, as to how much this story means to me. While my father served in this (hopefully) last great war in England with the 8th AF in Rattlesden as a munitions soldier for B-17s, I never served in my time. That war in Vietnam was not one which needed to be fought. No war is. However, if any war was ever needed to quell the insatiable thirst of horror by those who wish to rule the world at any cost, WWII was that war. I won't go into how it could have been prevented by more peaceful actions after WWI.I have seen this series twice now within the past year and will never forget.Tom Hanks, Steven Speilberg, every actor, producer and director and writer, such as Erik Bork, as well as each and every sound engineer, crew member,  and technician are to all be saluted by the audience for their amazing work in telling this story of Easy Company. Without them, this story would have never been properly told to the masses. Awards mean less than being able to tell the story with care, love, honor and respect. This is their achievement and one which few people ever get to experience.Sadly, only a few Easy Company brothers are left in this world. However, this series and the original book by Stephen E. Ambrose, will serve as their story to be told as long as people read and can view films. May we never, ever see such horror again in our world. It is up to each of us to remember these stories and to never forget the sacrifice of millions of men, women and children who suffered and died during the war. Our honor to them should be to instill peace in our world, to do whatever it takes to not enter into military battles. It is up to us and everyone who comes behind us, to never forget men like those in Easy Company, those who sacrificed with their lives to wrest peace from the clutches of a madman who wished to dominate the world.Rest easy, Easy Company...

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AEVJ1QHEDTNEN	Nicholas	Executive produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for HBO, Band of Brothers is a ten-part miniseries based on the book Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne From Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest by Stephen E. Ambrose. The series dramatically re-creates the path of Easy Company, an elite paratrooper unit, from their basic training at Camp Toccoa in Georgia in 1942, to D-Day, to their critical involvement in the Battle of the Bulge, through their triumph at the close of the war. The unit was one of the best trained and most productive in American military history, but it also suffered immense casualties. The series is an ensemble piece, involving dozens of characters, and cast with relative unknowns. To the extent that there is a central character, it is Dick Winters (Damian Lewis), who went to Toccoa as a lieutenant and was promoted, over the course of the war, to battalion commander. Each episode includes brief excerpts from present-day interviews with some of the surviving members of the company. While the series is not a hagiography, Winters is depicted as a brave, resourceful, and humane leader. It's clear that the men revered him, and that he genuinely respected and cared about them. There are a few other members of the unit that make a strong impression. Sobel (David Schwimmer of Friends), their C.O. at Toccoa, is depicted as a petty tyrant whose men bond together in their hatred of him. Nixon (Ron Livingston of Office Space) is Winters' fellow officer and best friend, and an alcoholic. Carwood Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg) is a decent, hard-working man, and a tremendous soldier who earns a battlefield commission for his exemplary leadership. Bill Guarnere (Frank John Hughes) fears nothing, and is known for his wise-guy attitude and hot temper. The series dramatizes the courage and fortitude of many others, but it's clear that Winters sets the tone for his men, and plays a pivotal role in the unit's success. The project involved several screenwriters, including Graham Yost (Speed) and E. Max Frye (Something Wild). Eight different directors were called upon for the ten installments, including Hanks, David Frankel (Miami Rhapsody), Mikael Salomon (Hard Rain), and Phil Alden Robinson (Field of Dreams). Still, the tone and style of the series remains fairly consistent. While the story of Easy Company has been condensed and altered in some minor ways for dramatic purposes, and much of the dialogue was, by necessity, invented, the producers placed a strong emphasis on accurately depicting the conditions under which these men lived, fought, and died. Several survivors from the company consulted on the project, and an enormous amount of money was spent on sets, costumes, and special effects in order to re-create their experience.	5.0	The Band of Brothers is the Best Mini-Series ever.	2004-12-27	7	7	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A85K51H02XWZU	Nicholas J. Bertollo	"Several years go, I saw the first few episodes of this when it first hit HBO.  Though I loved it, I took up a night job and couldn't see the last 7 episodes on TV when they first aired.  Fast forward to the spring of 2004.  I was in college then and my friends decided that instead of pissing our nights away playing videogames and watching anime (ugh, the horror!  What an utter fool I used to be!), we'd watch Band of Brothers, one episode a night for a week.  Having only seen a few episodes I was enthusiastic to finish the series.  The plan to watch one episode a night tanked right away, we ended up watching two a night.  We only refrained from watching three or four because honestly, what hardworking college student has four hours to put aside for watching TV on a Wednesday night?There were differences right away between what I'd seen on TV a few years ago and what I was watching now.  At least, I thought it was different - I remembered seeing something ""good"", but what I watched that spring was simply incredible.  I had no concept of what I had been watching when I saw the first episodes during high school.  This series is moving, highly emotional, and quite honestly, the best thing I have ever seen on a screen.  I will say again for clarity - it is my humble opinion that this is the best thing ever put to film.  People write this off as ""GI Joe"" action and mindless Nazi-killing.  I really wonder if they saw the same series I did.  If reviewers say that this is only about the action, they've missed the point.  The heart of this series is really the men and how they react to combat.  I was deeply moved by the characters (especially Dick Winters and Lewis Nixon, played by Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston, respectively), got a sense of the horrors of war (particularly the Normandy jump and the hellish artillery barrage outside Foy), and was brought to the brink of tears multiple times - Bastogne and the aforementioned Foy among others.  I am not a man that cries easily, either.  My girlfriend (what a gal!) got me the boxed set for Christmas, and after watching the series a second and third time through I can honestly say that if anything, I was more profoundly affected on successive viewings.As a side note, a friend and I saw Dick Winters speak a couple of weeks after I finished watching Band of Brothers in spring 2004 - anybody who says the characters are unbelievable or unrealistic is absolutely and irrevocably wrong.  Winters, the man, was EXACTLY the same as Winters, the character.  Standing outside that high school auditorium I'd driven out to (it was filled past capacity), I felt I'd already seen him before -  ten hours' worth!.  Damian Lewis did one hell of a job portraying his character.  Watch the special features (""We Stand Alone Together"" particularly) and it's obvious that the rest of the characters are more or less dead-on as well.  It's easy to say guys like Bull Randleman and John Martin were cliche or stereotypical, but I suspect that what we see on-screen is closer to reality than we can know.  Watching Babe Heffron being interviewed on the special features disc is a good example - in the series, Heffron is a smart-alecky kid from Philadelphia.  In interviews, he comes across as an old, smart-alecky guy from Philadelphia.  Ditto on Bill Guarnere.  In ""We Stand Lone Together"", Martin comes across as being like his character, Popeye comes across as being like his character, Shifty Powers comes across as being like his character -  you get where I'm going with this?  I came away thinking that the characters were extraodinarily true to the real men.  That's quite a feat in Hollywood these days.5/5 stars.  The series isn't just recommended - it's imperative you see this."	5.0	Perfection.	2005-02-01	14	13	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2198O25QYUPXE	Nicholas R.W. Henning	Band of Brothers is a highly absorbing WWII miniseries with a focus on the European Campaign. The format of a miniseries allows for a deeper experience in terms of giving face and personality to those featured. It is important for all generations to respect the sacrifice that was made by American personnel in WWII, and this miniseries is a commendable depiction. Band of Brothers allows viewers to experience a personal journey of sacrifice, tenacious will to survive under heavy fire, and supporting fellow comrades no matter what the circumstances. This miniseries is a fitting tribute to those who fought so gallantly for the freedom of Europe.Nicholas R.W.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A35P7ED76HLI94	Nicholas Walters	Band of Brothers was a great book and the transition from page to film was flawless.  It helped with Stephen Ambrose helming this before he died in 2001, and with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg helping produce.  However, the applause goes to the young actors who played the officers and enlisted men.  Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, Dale Dye, Kirk Acevedo, Michael Cudlitz, Donnie Wahlberg, Mark Gomez, and even Tom Hanks' son, Colin Hanks.  The film was brutally real, no bleeps or family friendly fair, just honest portrayals of the greatest generation of soldiers, ever.  The 506 Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, Easy Comany, is an ecclectic group from everywhere in the US.  The film keeps you interesting in every wise-cracking mechanic, businessman, farmer, and cab driver who lived and fought and even died for their country.  Every character existed and really trodded this earth.  Easy Company's reaction to the Nazi concentration camps was heartbreaking and equally on par with parts of Schindler's List, and even old movies like The Big Red One with Lee Marvin.  Shocking, and a horrible wake up call to farm boys and city dwellers sheltered from mass murder and Hitler until Pearl Harbor.  No soldier expected those horrors, let alone the Battle of the Bulge and D-Day.  Band of Brothers is not just a must for a historian or military freak, but a staple for most Americans seeking inspiration and recollections of patriotism which is sorely lacking.  This was released after September 11, on HBO and was well timed.  Tom, Steven, Mr. Ambrose, and the others, you did a magnificent job.  Kind of makes me want to see if Citizen Soldiers or D-Day will be made for HBO or a cable network.  Outstanding.	5.0	Best Factual War Miniseries Made, EVER	2004-06-25	6	6	0

It's written based on the first-hand account of several of the veterans whose stories it tells, and the veterans themselves appear briefly in the episodes to describe characters and events in each episode in their own words. The acting is excellent, the filming is excellent, and the historical perspective is truly unique in anything I've ever seen.I can't think of a time where I've been so uniformly impressed with a show or miniseries, five out of five.A note on this boxed set, it comes in a steel case (that has now had a very rough life being carried around a ranch and has protected its contents flawlessly) and is both sturdy and compact.

Gripping, compelling, and with a sympathetic portrayal of all its characters and events which manage to be not stereotypical but as impartial as it can be when told from the winner's side. It makes fascinating viewing of human motivation, brilliance and failure. Above all repsect for the other human being, whatever the position and choices in life is the undercurrent that shines through all the layers of activity. Something we can and should all connect to...I spent some of my first 8 years of life in the aftermath of the war ravaged Cologne in Germany. For a child it was hard to understand why much of the city was still in ruins, so many buildings deeply pockmarked, not to mention the psyche of those who had survived and had to get on with life. This series helped me put many things in perspective, such as relatives fighting on both sides of the lines, and the human aspects that, even though we often think we cannot make a difference in the world, we do so with every breath we take.If I were teaching history I'd make this series compulsory viewing.	5.0	Of human fascination	2006-11-18	8	6	2
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A33TBHM3O9AY17	No one of consequence	"Because that's exactly where it lands every time I watch any one of these incredibly well done episodes.  There simply are not enough superlatives in the English language to do justice to the unparalleled quality of this production.  Contrary to the misguided opinion of the ""viewer from San Diego"" (see below), this is not about glorifying war or depicting the average German soldier as an awful person.  Rather, it's about giving the viewer a rare insight into war in all its horror, confusion and human-ness (is that a word?).  No doubt the Germans had their own ""bands of brothers"" -- just read Guy Sajer's ""The Forgotten Soldier"" for a fine illustration of that.  However, this series doesn't take sides.  It shows both Americans and Germans alike as scared, tired, hungry, cold and confused.  The portrayal of the human and psychological toll of this conflict is not unbalanced, although admittedly the viewer only gets to ""personally"" know the characters on the American side.Even while the grim realities of war are highlighted, there is also an acute attention to historical detail and accuracy, right down to some of the minutiae described by the real survivors in Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name.  The series also presents an object lesson in courage, sacrifice and loyalty that is not to be overlooked.  Yes, war is an awful thing, but it also has the ability to bring out hitherto unknown greatness, albeit often subtle, in those who find themselves thrust into the middle of the conflict.  HBO and Spielberg do a wonderful job of striking just the right balance.The central character, the ""hero"" if you prefer, is Lt. (later Capt. and then Major) Richard ""Dick"" Winters, who is introduced early in Episode 1 as a platoon leader in Easy Company, and later the company commander after his predecessor turns up missing on the D-Day drop.  Winters proves himself an exceptional combat commander and later a highly competent battalion staff officer.  At every stage of his development, his exemplary leadership is underscored by a simple, down-to-earth (humble?) attitude and a deep concern for every soldier under his command.  This is well illustrated in Episode 5 when Winters personally leads his outnumbered men in a charge that catches two full companies of SS infantry by surprise.  The attack decimates the German units while only one of Winters' own men is killed and 22 wounded, yet even still he counts the cost and personally mourns the loss.In addition to the great development of the Dick Winters character (who was, of course, a real person), there is plenty of similar attention given to many others, such as Sgt. Guarnere and Capt. Nixon.  One of the other features that makes this such a great series is the phenomenally skillful camera work.  The positioning of the cameras, the jolt from a nearby artillery rounds, the jostling of men in the trenches, and the constant buzz and smack of bullets, all combine to put the viewer in the middle of the action with the men on the screen.  Frankly I think the ability to capture the ""atmosphere"" of combat rises to an even higher level than was demonstrated in ""Saving Private Ryan"", which set a new standard for modern war films.What more can I say?  Watch these for yourself.  You won't be disappointed -- not even a little bit.  There's no political agenda here.  What you'll see will (or should) give you pause to consider the nature and effects of war, but beyond that it's simply a great story about great men doing their best in an uncertain time.  Incredibly well done indeed!"	5.0	Excuse me while I pick my jaw up off the floor.	2004-01-06	5	3	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A341BG8RMH8QW	NotATameLion	Band of Brothers is a fitting chronicle of and tribute to the men who served in the 101st Airborne's Easy Company. The excellence of this series honors the brave men who fought for freedom and for each other. As the grateful grandson of a WWII veteran, this series served to enhance my respect for my gradfather and all those who fought tyranny and agression during the war.Every episode (my favorite being the one about Bastogne told from the medic's perspective) in this series is excellent. The tales of the men of Easy Company come to life in the acting, cinematography, and story-telling.There are moments in this series that make me weep and moments that make me proud to be an American. More often than not, these are the same moments.I cannot recommend this collection highly enough.	5.0	GREAT MEN...	2006-11-23	11	9	2

I was COMPLETELY blown away. I hadn't heard much about them and didn't know what to expect. It is definately one of my most prized DVD sets. The acting is top notch, and the commentary and stories from the actual members of Easy Co. before/after each episode I thought brought a unique addition to the series as a whole. This is the kind of cinematic work that will preserve an important piece of history for a long time. Kudos to all who contributed to this series!	5.0	Best DVD Set money can buy	2006-01-20	2	2	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3VB22CHHOZYJL	Oblio	"I've watched this series now at least four times . . . and I'm sure I'll be back for more. Just finished watching it again, and from the first episode, I felt like I ""knew"" these guys as if they were old comrades.Besides the superb story line and acting, I really valued the interviews at the start of each episode with the real-life ""brothers"" from the 101st Airborne's Easy Company. This time, I watched it on Amazon's streaming Prime service. At times, the ""spinning circle of death"" interrupted the viewing experience--reminding me of one of the benefits of viewing movies or TV shors on DVDs. Also, the DVD box set (which I also have) includes a full disk of ""special features,"" documenting the making of the series and the bootcamp experience the actors went through--every bit as challenging as what real soldiers experience (all under the ever-watchful eye of military consultant Dale Dye).Michael Kamen's theme music is just perfect for this series--a masterful piece of orchestral atmosphere. I was sad to hear he had died.I've also started watching the Spielberg-Hanks sequel ""The Pacific."" I'm about two-thirds into the series. While I like it, it is nowhere nearly as well-crafted or as engaging as BoB (the characters lack depth and the plot wanders). Though it does seem to be getting better around episode 6.[Update: Almost finished ""The Pacific,"" and I've got to say it grows on me with each episode. Already, I know I will watch this series again, too. Two points to note about ""The Pacific"": (1) The theme music by Hans Zimmer (he wrote the amazing otherworldly soundtrack for ""Gladiator""), while not quite as stirring as Michael Kamen's for BoB, also grows on me with each listening. (I'd love to have a CD with both soundtracks.) (2) I think the opening sequence with credits (a mix of ingenious graphics and video) might be the best, at least most creative, I have seen.Like Tom Hanks' ""Saving Private Ryan,"" BoB is probably the closest experience you can get to what the insanity of war is like, without actually being there. ""The Pacific"" has its moments, but doesn't come close to the riveting ordeal Easy Company had to endure in the freezing forests of Bastogne. [Update: At this point, I'd say both series show and deliver an experience of the madness of war--as well as the heroism of WWII soldiers, both in Europe and the Pacific.]My other favorite TV series: ""Lonesome Dove"" (the original, plus the prequel and various sequels--they're all great.)"	5.0	Probably the Best Series on TV -- Ever!	2014-06-10	1	1	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A30SG3P4634X05	ockat	This is a &#34;must-see&#34; series.  It epitomizes the personal aspects of the relationships formed among strangers thrown together in war and forged into bonds stronger than even blood relationships.  There was not one minute of it I didn't love, and so did my 13 year old son.  This may seem an odd choice for a mother-son bonding event, but it happened - so much so that I have purchased the boxed set to give him for a special remembrance of the evenings we spent watching it.	5.0	A MUST-SEE FOR EVERYONE OVER 12!	2014-06-13	1	1	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z	Octavius	This Spielberg/Hanks produced HBO miniseries is undoubtedly the best TV miniseries ever produced and, if compared to films, would be one of the 5 best war films of all time.In this mini-series, the audience is immersed into the best cinematic representation of what WWII was like for those brave soldiers who fought the last stretch of WWII in Europe from Normandy to Berlin 6/44-5/45.  Germany was on the wane but still had plenty of fighting left in it especially in Belgium during the Winter of 1944 in the Ardennes.  The story follows the lives of soldiers/friends assigned to EZ Company of the 101st Airborne who were dropped off behind enemy lines in Normandy as avant-garde contingents; they continued to serve in France, Belgium, Holland, Austria, and Germany until the end of the war in Europe.  Each DVD also contains an interview with the actual veterans whose lives are represented in the series where they recall and describe (sometimes with great emotion and difficulty) the experiences they felt and the bonds of friendship they formed in those harrowing years.As for the production values of the film, they are simply outstanding and equal, if not superior, to Spielberg's own 'Saving Private Ryan.'  This 10-hour miniseries is much deeper in character study and plot than any film could be and is therefore a superior production in that respect.  Although the series has one central character it tends to focus on, each episode in the film represents the perspective/narrative of one particular character in the platoon/company/batallion and their perspective on the events.  The acting is simply outstanding on the part of every actor in the series.  The special effects are as good if not better than 'Saving Private Ryan.'  In addition, the production is as faithful as possible to every detail of that period from speech/mannerisms, dress, uniforms, armaments, etc.This is without a doubt the best miniseries ever made and one of the top 5 war films to be produced.  Steven Spielberg has outdone himself in terms of producing this simply outstanding work of art.  This is a great film not only in terms of entertainment but also in terms of educating our youth as to the great courage and sacrifice demonstrated by these valliant soldiers and what their lives and times were like.  The most moving for me was to watch and hear the interviews of those men depicted in the series; when I see them cry and contemplate in silence as they remember those fateful years, I can only feel humble and respect the fact that they have experienced horrors and/or such selfless acts of heroism that are simply too painful for them to recite even today.  This miniseries is truly nothing less than a great mark in the achievement of film and historical reenactment/preservation: I most strongly recommend its purchase.	5.0	The Best Miniseries/War Film Ever Made	2005-05-02	5	5	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2LFFLST1J8DQ3	oddjob7783	Band of Brothers is an incredible miniseries. It seems no expense was spared in recreating a historically accurate setting. The casting and character development is exceptional, and the directing is superb. Each episode is introduced with snippets of interviews with actual members of easy company, which served as a potent reminder that the seemingly unbelievable events depicted did indeed happen to these men. Im glad that such a work has been accomplished because it is a vivid reminder of what the greatest generation did for our country, and we as a nation should never forget it. Especially in the world today, when it is easy to forget the underpinning values of our country, it is important to reflect back upon those virtuous qualities of the heroic men and women who won the war for us. I would definitely recommend purchasing this miniseries.	5.0	Simply Excellent	2005-06-14	6	6	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AUDSM2CTLLW1Q	Patrick L. Randall	"There are few greater achievements that have made their way to the small screen than the HBO mini-series ""Band of Brothers"".  This 10-part epic is based on the book of the same name by noted historian Stephen E. Ambrose, which tells the story of the men of Easy Company, and elite World War II unit of paratroopers from the beginning of their training in 1942 through all their epic battles until the surrender of Germany in 1945.  Ambrose's book is one of the best military histories I have ever read.  With the ""Band of Brothers"" mini-series, the story of Easy Company is realized visually in a way that few war dramas or books have ever been.  The 10-part, 12-hour length necessitated its development as a television mini-series, yet ""Band of Brothers"" far surpasses anything I have seen committed to the big screen.  Each episode tells a different story from a different point of view along Easy Company's journey from training until the end of the war.  Lieutenant (later Major) Richard Winters is the focal point of this series.  It was Winters whose contributions and assistance helped Ambrose write the book in the first place, and he is the one who is conscience of the Company.  Each episode brings a fresh perspective to the stories told and are briefly summarized:Episode 1 - Curahee:  This first episode focuses on the earliest days of Easy Company under the training of the vicious and petty Captain Sobel.  Sobel's actions make Easy the finest company in the Regiment, but also prove him to be a petty leader and an inept battlefield commander.  This episode shows how Easy originally came into being and how they developed in the unit that would become Hitler's worst nightmare.  It ends with the spectacular image of the C-47s flying over the English Channel on the way to the start of the invasion with the massive Allied flight sailing below.  Few images are as awe-inspiring.Episode 2 - Day of Days:  The second episode begins with the paratrooper drops behind German lines the night before D-Day and focuses on the assault let by Lieutenant Winters on fortified German guns on D-Day.  Winters is thrust into command of Easy Company when the previous commander dies aboard his C-47 during the assault.  The images of the nighttime airdrop are truly nerve-wracking and breathtaking.  It should be noted that Lt. Winters' assault on the German fortified guns is still textbook material at West Point today.Episode 3 - Carentan:  Having successfully invaded France, the Allies (Easy Company specifically) are charged with capturing the town of Carentan, followed by a cross field battle with German armor.  Much of this episode is told from the perspective of Private Albert Blythe, a soldier who is dazed by battle and must face his fears to become a good soldier.  Lieutenant Spiers offers sage advice to Blythe by telling him ""You have to realize that you're already dead.  Then, you can do what need to do"".Episode 4 - Replacements:  Many of the men who initially died are now being replaced by new soldiers.  As they are not original Taccoa men, the replacements are not met with an enthusiastic welcome.  This is all put aside as the disastrous Operation Market Garden is launched.  The focus of this episode becomes Sergeant ""Bull"" Randlemen who takes care to watch out for his men and then must carefully maneuver himself to avoid capture by the Germans when he trapped behind enemy lines.Episode 5 - Crossroads:  Focuses on a surprise attack on two German companies in the crossroads dike.  This stunning and resounding victory is Captain Winters last as Easy Company commander.  He is promoted to Battalion Executive Officer.  The story shifts to Winters reflecting on the war so far during his `forced' 48-hour leave in Paris before returning the Easy Company men to battle when the Germans break through and start the Battle of the Bulge.Episode 6 - Bastogne:  Deals with the terror of repeated German shellings and assaults upon Easy Company's entrenched line.  Doc Eugene Roe becomes the focal point as he tries to patch together wounded and preserve his own sanity.  There are some gruesome wounds depicted in this episode.Episode 7 - Breaking Point:  The men of Easy are at their last threads as the constant mortar attacks continue to wounds some soldiers and claim the lives of others.  First Sergeant Carwood Lipton keeps Easy together in spite of the inept leadership of Lieutenant Dike.  In the subsequent attack on the town of Foy, Lieutenant Spiers relieves Dike when Dike freezes and leads Easy to a successful assault.Episode 8 - The Last Patrol:  Private Webster has rejoined Easy in Hagenau but is not well-received after having missed Bastogne.  The men of Easy begin to realize that they may actually make it out of the war alive and are disheartened by dangerous assignments like a patrol to capture German prisoners for intelligence.Episode 9 - Why We Fight:  Captain Nixon deals with the consequences of his alcoholism while the Allied forces accept the surrender of 300,000 German soldiers.  During a patrol in the Alps, Easy Company stumbles upon a horrible sight, a Nazi concentration camp.  The images of the surrendering Germans are impressive.  The images of the concentration camp are horrifying and saddening.Episode 10 - Points:  The war in Europe is over and Easy Company captures Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Berchtesgaden and acquire the riches that lay within.  While awaiting orders to head to the Pacific war, Easy must deal with the perils of idle time in which men are still dying or are being hurt.  The story of Easy Company ends with the telling of the lives the men lived after the war ended.There is no shortage of superlatives that can be heaped upon ""Band of Brothers"".  This DVD is an amazing accomplishment and a testament to the bravery of the men of Easy Company."	5.0	Words can't do justice to this saga	2003-09-03	7	6	1

Chaffer	Band of Brothers gave me insight to the conditions my father endured during WWII and never spoke of or complained about.My father served in the Army Corp of Engineers during WWII and landed in LeHarve, France near Normandy. He never talked about the war until late in his life.Band of Brothers is a history lesson brought to life that made me sad, proud, and empathic to all the men and women who fought in that war. Hanks and Spielberg tell a mesmerizing story that makes you anxiously await the next chapter. The sadness comes when you think of the reality of Band of Brothers and the loss of so many lives and the human suffering.For me, it brings a realization for some of the things my father did and the paths that he chose after he returned from war.My father-in-law served in the Marine Corp during WWII in Tarawa.  He stil carries a bullet lodged in his shoulder as a reminder. In watching the Pacific by Hanks and Spielberg it has met the expectation set by Band of Brothers and maybe exceeded it.	5.0	A Greater Understanding	2010-05-16	4	4	0

But the rest of the cast truly hit the spot and pulled it off, head on. At the beginning of most episodes, there were interviews with the real-life veterans. They helped to bring it together as far as the focus of the episode went.This show is for real people who don't need reality shows. The blood looks real, and deep-down is real. The gore will get you to the core. It will inform those who want to be informed about the real horrors and tragedies of war. Today's wars may be on different soils, but Band of Brothers - for those who really want to learn and not close their eyes to the world- will remind you that they are all driven by the blindness and insanity of one or two people with delusions that lead their armies to do things that they otherwise wouldn't be doing - and ruin millions of lives in the process.	5.0	Band of Brothers: Educational and Riveting	2014-06-29	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A13PKGGJXY7NOZ	Pedro Diaz	When I bought it, I did with the purpose of using this in the classroom with my students ( teaching english as a second language) and one of the reason that I purchased the  product was because I read the details of  it and it said that closed captioned was included on the film and it wasn't. There  are Spanish and french subtitles, but not english ones. I  use the film to teach  english to  my  students and when it's really difficult for them to understand, closed captioned helps  me to guide them in their understanding. So please make sure that next time you put the descriptions of a product, be  more specific. I really think that information given is misleading and even thought the product is more than I expected, the closed captioned is essential to  my purpose of having it. Another thing Could you guide where to find the transcript of the series, so I can use in the classroom?  I would appreciate that information very much.....Thanks	4.0	Excellent Product, but......	2002-12-12	26	3	23

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2000DWMMYNIYB	Peter Lorenzi	"""I wasn't a hero but I fought with a lot of men who were."" So says one of this heroic brand of brothers, the men of Easy Company. This best captures the ethos of this work. And it is an excellent experience and vivid history.This epic runs from July 1942 to shortly after the end of the war in Europe. Starting with the company''s initial bonding experience, under the hot, miserable, days of training under an abusive, ""chickens--t""  first leader, the brothers came together. They learned to hate their leader perhaps as much as the looming Germans; later, this mode of training earned begrudging respect from some of the men. But not before a revolt in their ranks prior to being shipped out to Europe.D-Day offered an early, hard test of their training and teamwork. Their success at knocking out a field battery, I have heard, remains a training example today. Following the own, self-assessment that, if there was a dirty job that needed to be done, Easy Company would be assigned to do it, the brother fight through Holland, the Ardennes, and, finally, Germany.The details of the production fully reveal the $120 million invested. The sepia tones create a wonderful sense of time and place. The large, ensemble cast is magnificent, including David Schwimmer in an unlikely and unlikeable role as the much-despised training camp leader. Damien Lewis, a fine English actor, captures the respect of his men as the focal point Cpt Winter. Each man has something to say, something to contribute. They really are a team, linked by mutual respect and a hard-edged sense of purpose. Watching the men train, struggle, fight and die, I could help but feel frustrated, sympathetic, impressed and sad along with them. I cried more times than I care to recall.This is a fitting, perfect extension of ""Saving Private Ryan."" As Colonel Chamberlain says in ""Gettysburg"", ""What it comes down to, in the end, is that we're fighting for is each other."""	5.0	A sweeping war saga of courage and brotherhood	2002-11-07	14	13	1

I first saw it compliments of a friend who taped it from the HBO telecast and I watched it over three evenings. It was one of the most moving and riviting experiences I have ever had from a television production ... one that truely portrayed the ""sharp end"" of war, and its effects on the individuals involved. Full marks to the production crew and cast.

In fact, it's almost like a series built out of that movie.  I am also a huge fan of Steven Ambrose, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg - having all three of those together, with a hand into this series, has really added a first class touch to this mini-series.Steven Ambrose has a remarkable way of telling the ""big story"" of history through personal events of several people directly involved in the historical event.  Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg's close relationship and dedication to quality filmmaking, historical accuracy clearly brings Steven Ambrose's written word to life.Finally, while there are some ""bigger-name"" actors in this, they do not dominate the series so you get a sense that the movie is not ""Actor-dependant"" but story dependent.As an amateur military historian - (WWI-II European Theater of Operations) and a former Army Officer, I strongly recommend this series to anyone interested in learning about the dynamics of small units before, during and after combat."	5.0	Excellent addition to Saving PVT Ryan!	2002-10-13	2	2	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1XB9PFC6JJZAH	Pete Tolton	With stunning acting and excellent storytelling, Band of Brothers is spectacular, if not the best World War II film of all time. Band of Brothers excells in many ways but its greatest characteristic is the way it attatches you to its characters. From the first sargeants to the privates, the viewers get a sense that they have known the depicted soldiers for years and have a different opinion of each. Spanning ten episodes and over seven hours of high-quality video. The special effects are simply spectacular and a sense of fear and adrenaline is felt by all who experience it from their couches. Overall greatness. And if all else fails, it is worth atching simply because of the cameo by SNL's Jimmy Fallon.	5.0	Amazing reinactment of 101st airborne, best World War 2 film	2002-08-07	1	1	0

Band of Brothers is the story of E company, 506th PIR, 101st Airborne Division.  It begins with their training in 1942 and continues until the end of the war.Finally a movie has been produced which pays tribute to the men and women who lived through this great and terrible time.  ""Hollywood"" is kept to a minimum, historical authenticity is as high as it can be while still capturing the interest and attention general population - which is a lot to be said, considering the mini-series runs 10 hours long.Band of Brothers has the visual realism of Saving Private Ryan, with the historical accuracies of A Bridge Too Far.Finally, a QUALITY film about the men who fought in WWII!Sincere thanks to all the vets out there who sacrificed their lives (physical and emotional) so we could be sitting here, freely going about our lives."	5.0	History in the making.	2002-08-20	3	3	0

Could not believe in these times of TV schlock what a quality production this was.A few weeks ago I was listening to a local talk radio show. The guest that day was a local college professor who has written several books on World War II, lectured on the subject, has one of his works optioned for a movie, etc. People were calling in to ask questions about different WWII movies and what were his opinion on the movies mentioned. Some he liked, some he panned. I called in and asked what he thought about Band of Brothers. Basically he was full of praise for this miniseries. In fact, he said he had ordered it for his class as a teaching tool. At that point the host of the show said if this professor was using it in his classroom then it had to be special.	5.0	Comments from a historian	2004-06-07	11	10	1

Band of Brothers shows, from a very bottom up perspective, the human condition during one of the largest events in human history to date.  A very well put together series with obviously a big budget.  From training to the end of WWII in Europe the story focuses on a small group of men that live, eat, sleep, train, fight and some times die together.  Puts into perspective on a very human level how ordinary people deal with life when they are caught in extraordinary circumstances.

The stories are not accurate, and contain much exaggeration and dramatization.The reason that Easy Company has become famous is because Stephen Ambrose's book and Spielberg and Hank's miniseries. It is NOT because Easy is an exceptional unit. Ambrose wrote a book about Easy Company because one of his neighbors was an E Company member.If you read the citations of Medal of Honor recipients in World War II, you will know that actually Easy Company is an AVERAGE unit in the US military. NOT the exceptional one. There are more than 450 Medal of Honor given in WW2. None of Easy Company members received Medal of Honor. None of Major Winters' battalion members received Medal of Honor. None of Sink's 506th PIR members received Medal of Honor.Winters said in one interview that ""only 1 person in 1 Division can receive Medal of Honor"" (he said that's one of the reasons he did not get it). Again, this is NOT true. There are other Division that have more that 1 members received Medal of Honor in WW2. [...]On the other hand, The Pacific miniseries may not be so great to watch as BoB. But after seeing The Pacific, you may know that many other units (other than Easy Company) may be facing much tougher situation than Easy Company during WW2. I am glad that the Pacific includes the stories of at least 1 Medal of Honor recipient in the movie.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2KE9VDX8GCAKE	"""purplo"""	"The outstanding HBO miniseries ""Band of Brothers,"" based on the Steven Ambrose book of the same name, should be required viewing for everyone, due to its unflinching depiction of the realities of war.  But this series is as captivating as it is informative, and even entertaining despite the difficult subject matter.  This is the true story of the Easy Company of the 105th Airborne Division paratroopers, following their combat training, their actual combat on D-Day, at Market-Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and their liberation of a concentration camp and control of Hitler's German mountain refuge.  All of the characters are real, and are mostly played by lesser known actors.  David Schwimmer of ""Friends"" does appear in a couple episodes as do ""Saturday Night Live's"" Jimmy Fallon (very briefly) and Tom Hanks' son Colin.  Fans of NBC's ""Boomtown"" will also recognize four of the actors, especially Donnie Wahlberg and Neal McDonough, who have major roles.  Each episode begins with pertinent moments from interviews with the actual surviving members of Easy Company, though they are not identified so as not to give away which characters survive the war.  It takes a while, but becoming familiar with the many characters and their comaraderie for one another is what makes this series so compelling.  Producers Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have delivered outstanding filmmaking which will definitely remind you of ""Saving Private Ryan"" but improves on that film because of the depth that a miniseries allows.  You will want to watch the DVD extras, especially the 80 minute documentary with the surviving soldiers, so you can see these characters as they are now in real life.  The thirty minute making-of documentary is decent but not extraordinary.  Actor Ron Livingston's ""video diaries"" for HBO take you through the ten-day ""boot camp"" that the actors went through before shooting, and provides some amusement, but is mainly just HBO promotional material as are the rest of the DVD extras."	5.0	Captivating and informative WWII miniseries	2003-04-23	39	35	4

I believe this series was produced by the sam team that did Saving Private Ryan.This series is brillaintly produced and directed and gives you insight into a WWII soldiers prespective from their point. These are actual soldiers who served in this company, and it tracks the events that shaped their lives from D-DAY then unto the end of the war.I believe that once you start this series you will not stop until you finish.	4.0	Band of Brothers	2005-08-16	5	2	3

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2K3ZL3HFLHJYC	Randall D Learish	For those who are familiar with WWII history and/or have watched the Burns WWII documentary, or read Steven Ambrose's book, you will appreciate this mini-series.  Too many Hollywood producers would overly dramatize this material, or try to graft onto it a political message, or simply fictionalize it.  The characters in this mini-series were made so real because their humble interviews were interspersed throughout.  None of them, individually, were depicted as super-heros.  Nonetheless I was left with admiration for their sacrifice and their excellence.  And also a strange sense of regret that my generation seems incapable of banding together around a common goal, the way that Easy Company did.	5.0	An excellent slice of WWII history	2014-06-24	0	0	0

I loved every minute of the 10 hour series: the dialog, the character development, the cinematography, the action, and especially the Michael Kamen soundtrack.

As soon as I am finished with this review, I am ordering the set. This is definitely a keeper! I enjoyed this mini-series more than any other, possibly more than ""Saving Private Ryan"". The series follows the book better than any two hour movie could possibly hope to, and the book was excellent. The attention to detail is oustanding. The actors are mostly unknowns,(with the exception of David Schwimmer, (Ross from ""Friends""),who does a great job as the infamous hardass Capt. Sobel of the Toccoa boot camp days), and they perform admirably. If you are at all interested in WWII, YOU MUST SEE THIS."	5.0	"If you liked ""Saving Private Ryan"", this is a must see!!!!"	2003-01-02	2	2	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A15X6XSDE15VIQ	Raphael Llusca	This 10 chapter miniseries set is an exquisite mix of Saving Private Ryan with the documentary feel of an A&E; type production and the drama, look and the inevitable touch of Spielberg/Hanks brilliance and genius.Incredibly real and gut wrenching, the miniseries begins at 101st Airborne Division training camp at Camp Toccoa, USA. Whereupon we learn about the tough reality of being in the Airborne Division and the severity of living under a military chain of command. Under the command of Lt. Sobel, Easy Company is trained and drilled every single day until they become on of the best companies in the Division, a fact that will prove to be woeful in battle.At long last (2 years in training) the Allies have concocted a plan to start the invasion/liberation of Nazi occupied France and Europe. D-day is gruesome but Easy Company is more terrible events are yet to come.As we follow along the story, we slowly get into knowing people like Lipton, Luz, Perconte, Winters, Buck, Bull, Skip Muck, Popeye, Guarnere and many memorable characters who we see triumph, survive and perish in the cruelty of war.We are taken into the very jaws of the enemy at battles like Foy, Carentan, Bastogne, the Eagle's nest, all these in the dreariest and bitter conditions of bad weather and lack of supplies.  We are also shown the harsh confrontation and evil they were up against when Easy and other companies face the concentration camp in Landsberg.A miniseries all WWII fans and followers are sure to enjoy, hands down a top 5 stars and Thumbs Up.You will enjoy it.	5.0	Band of Brothers - The Complete 10 Chapter Miniseries	2002-08-08	4	4	0

Band of Brothers, in my opinion, is simply the greatest depiction of World War II ever to grace the screen.  I come from a generation whose grandparents served in the war and short of first hand stories, this can really drive home the magnitude of war to the younger generation and give us an appreciation for the sacrifices that generation made and to realize our generation gets to reap the benefits of said sacrifice.The scenes where the abandoned concentration camp is discovered and the German general addressing his troops are equisite.Simply outstanding.	5.0	Fantastic	2008-12-12	2	2	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A7U81HSVJTF7K	Rene	This series shows a quite accurate and faithful account of a company of the 101st Airborne Division, specifically 506th Regiment Easy Company.  Its realism and absorbing account shows what it was like to be in a war where literally millions around the globe were involved to push back and end the despotism that could have taken over the entire globe.  Band of Brothers shows that the real commitment in war is not to the nation or any other large body politic.  It is fought by people who wish to take care of the soldier next to them and not let them down.  I highly recommend this recounting of a company of men who were in the forefront of the fight in Europe on D-Day and through its conclusion on VE Day.  They were truly a &#34;Band of Brothers.&#34;	5.0	The Reality of WWII	2014-06-10	1	1	0

I've watched this at least three times now and it never gets old. Maybe I need a life, but I am fascinated by what these men went through and how they survived the war. Of course there's great action, but also some powerful drama as well. This Blu-ray set is actually an upgrade for me from the standard DVD. If that doesn't prove how great I think Band of Brothers is, nothing will!	5.0	Worth Watching Again and Again	2013-07-30	2	2	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AJANSYFGUIB3K	"R Fain ""Rod Fain"""	Epic example of the courage of American soldiers during WWII by the Airborne Infantry.  Based on the true accounts from the book Band of Brothers this is truly a fine piece of work and all the actors in it did credit to the real life heros they portrayed.  Of particular note is that of Damian Lewis who does portray Lt. Winters as a leader of men who does a difficult job of leading men into battle knowing that some may day so that there may be freedom for all who live.  My favorite line from the series comes in the 2nd episode when Damian Lewis (Winters) is in command of Easy Company prior to D-Day and tells Neal McDonough (Lt Compton) not to ever take anything from the men even in gambling.  I believe this was due to his belief that these men were to give so much of themselves in the coming conflict that the officers should not ask more than that,  The knowledge that an officer will be asking men to go into situations where some will die always seems to weigh on Winters mind throughout the series and is a telling point of the sacrifices he sees the men make who were all volunteers.	5.0	The best series I've ever seen done on WWII is a very real way.  Epic is the best way to describe this series	2014-07-04	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1CN1VOOUFYCMI	R. Greenberg	"There's not much more that needs to be said.  Hold this up to other celebrated war movies: Patton, Paths of Glory, A Walk in the Sun, Twelve O'Clock High, Bridge on the RIver Kwai, The Longest Day, Platoon, The Deer Hunter, Battleground, the list goes on.  I greatly admire all of those movies, and do not intend to diminish them in any sense.While arguably Band of Brothers may not be considered a ""movie"" since it is a series of smaller, great movies, perhaps it is better described as the best depiction of war on film ever produced.  I don't think that's overdoing it.Without the experience of making Saving Private Ryan, a great war movie (in sections) in its own right, the Speilberg/Hanks team could not have perfected their vision manifest in Band of Brothers.  Acting, dialogue, direction, cinematography, interview footage, music -- particularly the music -- are all excellent and intertwined to near perfection."	5.0	Quite simply the best war movie ever made	2008-02-09	0	0	0

There are a lot of elements, characters and action that everyone would enjoy. The show is very reminiscent to Saving Private Ryan, and this is a good thing. I didn't like the story as much in Ryan as I did here, I mainly loved how the show was captured. The grittiness really helps in making it seem more realistic and interesting. I myself am really looking forward to this release, everyone has to view this. I have to thank HBO, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg for making such a great collaboration on such a great series.	5.0	Must Own!!	2002-09-11	8	7	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AVUCSHL50T121	R.

Those younger should learn, from that war and other wars since, that there is no glory in war. It could happen again though motives and weapons have changed the where and the how.The series is well done and holds the viewer from scene to scene to episode to episode until the conclusion.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A35DI28HRSEEP6	Richard B. Schwartz	Band of Brothers is a 10-part account of the wartime experience of Easy Company, in the 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division.  It begins with their training experience in Georgia and follows them to England, to D-Day in Normandy, Operation Market Garden in Holland, the siege of Bastogne and, eventually, the capturing of Hitler's Eagle Nest headquarters/estate in Bavaria.Featuring Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, David Schwimmer, Donnie Wahlberg, et al. the miniseries (based on Stephen Ambrose's book) features the individual experiences of individual characters in separate episodes and contains opening commentary by the characters' real-life counterparts.  A sixth disc, containing material on the making of the miniseries, etc. features more interviews with the actual, surviving members of Easy Company.Under the leadership of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, the miniseries contains a great deal of realistic footage of the sort seen in Saving Private Ryan.  Limbs are severed and the sounds of bullets and shrapnel whizzing through the air are omnipresent.  We feel the cold of Bastogne, luxuriate in the beauties of Austria and suffer through the training regimens to which the company is subjected.  Watching is not always easy or pleasant, but the emotional impact of the separate episodes is strong.The individual episodes are quite uneven.  Some are extremely powerful, e.g., the training episode and the D-Day episode (with stunning use of CGI).  Others are less satisfactory.  The Bastogne episode, for example, is a long, cold sojourn in foxholes with German artillery and mortar fire shattering trees and shattering bodies.  Civilians, however, will obtain a realistic sense of the actual nature of war.The production is courageous in representing the courage of some individuals, the incompetence of others, given the fact that the `characters' represent real people.  Given the fact that the narrative is historically accurate, our `wishes' as viewers sometimes go unsatisfied.  We want to see much more of Damian Lewis in the role of Dick Winters, for example, but the fact is that Dick Winters was promoted to a battalion position and could not be there, leading Easy Company, for the duration of the miniseries.In general, this is a superb miniseries and the subsidiary material on the sixth disc is excellent.  The actual, historical members of Easy Company speak for themselves with great but simple eloquence and their eyes tell a story of war that brings the reality home in ways that films can never quite do.	5.0	Superb Miniseries	2012-12-04	2	2	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AAA1AB2WCC8TU	Richard G. Redfern	This is a masterpiece if ever there was one. Far and above what you would expect and certainly not propaganda.This a set of DVD's that you will watch over and over again as it reminds us that these brave men, Some of who are still with us today and their numbers are dwindling fast. There have been other films made about actual warfare and yet this is set apart by being the remembrance of those who lived it. This is a history lesson on a part of WWII and it should be heard and seen by anyone interested in history.This more than the sum of the DVD's contained in the box It is more a reminder of all who have sacrificed so much for their country in so many different wars and in so many different places. Remember them all before they too are gone and forgotten.There are two episodes on each DVD and the sixth contains bonus information that is certainly worth the price in it's own right.Buy it, watch it, pass it down to your children and grandchildren. This is about s close to the real thing as anyone who hasn't served in combat should ever want to get.Maybe there is a lesson here, I hope you find it and understand what happens when we allow governments to get out of control.	5.0	The Greatest Generation	2014-03-26	1	1	0

I would recommend this to all who are WWII history buffs and those who are not.  Just this past winter going thru the cold snowy countryside on a Sunday drive I caught myself thinking....how would you like to be out in that woods without proper clothing, no heat, no fire, no lights and ice cold food if you could get it unfrozen, and to top it off, have people out there who you didn't even know want to kill you.  One of the things that really pulled it all together for me was watching those men discover and go thru their first Jewish work camp.  Co &#34;E&#34; went from fighting to save one another to knowing why they were over there risking their lives.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1138FOQFFO1HA	Richard Reed	"As an old World War II veteran who ""was there and did that"" in the European Theater of Operations, I'm compelled to mention that there are a few relatively minor technical flaws in the film.  One rather obvious one is the way ""Captain Sobel"" wears his garrison cap in the first episode.  This is particularly annoying, since the role is that of an officer obsessed with Army rules and regulations.  In those days we were taught that the garrison cap was always to be worn ""two fingers over the right ear and one finger over the right eyebrow.""  In the film ""Sobel"" wears his cap on the left side toward the back of his head.  Captain Dale Dye, technical advisor for the film, dropped the ball on that one and some others...probably because he was Marine rather than Army.Despite it and a few other small flaws of that nature, ""Band of Brothers"" is exceptionally accurate, authentic, powerful and moving.  In particular, I was impressed with the honesty and realism of the emotions displayed in the film.  All of the young actors in the ensemble cast are very credible.  The performances of Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, and Donnie Wahlberg are especially effective.The unexpected and very graphic sex scene set in Germany on one of the discs was totally gratuitous.  The shortsighted writers and producers could have omitted it entirely without sacrificing the integrity of the film.  The film can and should be used to enhance the teaching of World War II history.  However, teachers may be inhibited from showing it to youth under 14, merely because of one questionable X-rated scene.  Of course, one could argue that war itself is obscene."	5.0	Band of Brothers - An Outstanding Film	2003-07-05	5	5	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AE96CWKCHQCQX	R. Matheson	"This series has changed me.  I never had the opportunity to watch the first run of the series on HBO, as it was a bit too ""real"" for my family.  My mother's uncle was a fighter pilot who was shot down over Poland (after splashing no less than 4 German planes), and I suppose it brought back too many hard memories.  I bought this DVD set and thoroughly enjoyed each of the 10 episodes.  Right now, I'm reading the book upon which this movie was based, which I also highly recommend.  It's much easier to put a ""face"" to the characters after seeing the series and having it fresh in your mind.What really makes it special is that these things actually happened, and the survivors of Easy Company comment on the events as a prelude to each episode.  In a very cool move, the names of these suvivors are not revealed until the documentary on Disc 6.  As a result, you don't know who will survive until the end.  This is one item where the special features (especially the documentary) are every bit as important as the film itself; perhaps even more so.If you enjoy war movies, buy this.  It will keep you entertained for 10 straight hours.  I plan on watching it again after I'm done with the book.  This film captures the comraderie of army life in WWII, as well as the low points and high points.  These guys were more than members in the same unit.  They were, in most cases, comrades and brothers, and it shows.  This film is not for the faint of heart, however.  While not quite as blatantly gory as Saving Private Ryan, I assure you blood does flow in this film.  It pulls no punches, but doesn't overdo it.Not only the story is good; the cinematography is breathtaking.  A truly exceptional story and a tribute to those men who died defending the world from Nazi domination.  Awesome."	5.0	I am SO hooked.	2003-04-25	0	0	0

I had an uncle who was a paratrooper when he was 18 and did all of the jumps for the European campaign.

While not completely historically accurate (what film can be, there has to be some liberties taken) it gives you a solid well documented account of what young men see in combat. By this point, you all know the story....the 101st Airborne takes the fight to the Germans. It chronicles the grueling training they received prior to deploying for war, takes them to the skies above Normandy, through the vicious house to house fighting in France and Holland. Then the frozen forrests of Belgium, then finally to Germany itself. It's a fatastic story that should be passed on from generation to generation to remind them how everyday men like these (as well as all the other men of all the other allied countries) fought to preserve mankind.The blu-ray edition is phenomonal. The video and audio quality is untouchable. One of the best bluray releases in my collection. I am a grain hater lol, there are scenes where heavy grain is prevalant, but thats how the film was meant to look...old, gritty with the bright colors washed out of it. The detail on this bluray is excellent. You can see the stiching on uniform patches, sweat dripping from the foreheads of the men as they push forward. The audio is outstanding. The bass from explosions will rock your living room. The soft gentle sounds of the peaceful wilderness while Maj. Winters is enjoying a swin in Austria will make you feel liek you are there. The supplements are great, I really like ""in the word of easy company."" This option is additional footage from the first person accts taken during the original production. It comes to you in the form of pop ups on the screen while watching the episodes. I've seen each episode 20 times easily, so getting this fresh addition made it seem like i was watching it again for the very first time.This is a must have bluray."	5.0	The ultimate WW2 motion picture	2010-02-03	3	2	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	R. Nicholson	"Band of Brothers: An unbelievable event, made for TV. Produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, this series, based on true occurrences, has all the realism and gut wrenching tension that we saw in ""Saving Private Ryan"".I had no idea of what was in store for me when I dropped the first disc in the DVD player. I was simply mesmerized: I could have sat through the entire series non-stop except for the fact the five movie discs plus one specialty disc took up about 12 hours. I could hardly wait for the next day to arrive to watch the next segment.The series is about a group of men that volunteer for the newly formed parachute regiment and eventually drop in behind enemy lines in Normandy, France on D-day, June 6, 1944. They eventually end up capturing Hitler's Eagle's Nest retreat in Austria as WWll ends.When I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" I didn't think that any war movie could be better: I was wrong. Band of Brothers is well acted, incredible realistic and shows you what a prolonged campaign must have been like with the constant stress and tension that turned boys into men and men into.....As this series develops, from one story to the next, you begin to appreciate the meaning of the cliche "" the fog of war"": sometimes simple sorties turn into unexpected nightmares and then other times when all seem lost, something or someone, completely unexpected, will turn up and save the day. You just can never predict in war what will happen: who will turn in a hero or a man paralyzed with fear or fatigue. Nothing is ever a 100% sure bet.Adding to the drama of the story are the interviews with the actual participants who lived through this horrific period and are still alive today. You can still see the agony in some of their faces when they recall old events and missing friends that didn't return home with them. Unbelievably touching!All in all an incredible series: something everyone should see just to make you realize what these men (and women) went through for us.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	"Michael Kaman,music.Kaman is responsible in a large part for the success of this wonderful mini series co-produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.The music is epic in tone,grand in sweep and sets the emotional mood throughout the series.Kudos to Kaman for his spectacular work.The series,based on the book by the late Stephen Ambrose of the same name,follows the exploits of the men of the 101st Airborne(Screaming Eagles),506 PIR(Parachute Infantry Regiment),E(Easy)Company from their training in Toccoa,Georgia in 1942 to near the end of the units de-activation at the end of /46.Ambrose while generally a good author was known to have his ""moments"" and ""Band of Brothers"" was no exception.The biggest mistake he made here is depicting E Company taking Hitlers' so called ""Eagle's Nest"" above the town of Berhtesgarden,first.In point of fact the 7th Infantry from the Third Infantry Division took it on May 4/45,a day before the 101st arrived.This has been long known fact as it was even in the 101st Divsions' own official history in ""Rendezvous With Destiny"" and even in(the Airbornes' own over all commander)General Maxwell Taylors' memoirs,both written years ago.It's unfortunate Ambrose didn't do the proper research.In 2008 a plaque was finally dedicated at the ""Eagle's Nest"" site of the 3rd's accomplishment.However,despite this faux paux and others much smaller,the series is still an oustanding piece of story telling.It tells with great drama,grit and realism the story of these brave and great young men as they trudge across Europe,often enduring the unendurable.There is little left out as far as realistic touches go;from the equipment,weapons and machinery used to the interaction of the men themselves and the wounds they receive both pyhsically and mentally,as they slowly and surely bond with each other,becoming ""brothers"" in arms.We also witness a certain""pecking order"" that develops amongst the men;from those that were there from basic training and all the way to end,as compared to the replacements that arrive piecemeal into the group.There are ten eps in this series ranging from around 50-70 minutes in length.All are filmed in widescreen(taken from a hi-def master)with a colour-washed sepia tone to them,giving a nice added touch to the proceedings.Also the camera work and editing provides(especially during battle scenes)a wonderful immediacy that draws the viewers easily into the action.The actors throughout the series display a wonderful restraint,an ""under-acting"",if you will,which again serves to enhance the entire pace and mood of the series(watch for Simon Pegg of ""Hot Fuzz"" fame briefly as a courier!).From the acting to the directing,editing,story writing and to it's final execution,it is top drawer all the way.Therefore it was no surprise that it garnered itself six of the 19 Emmy awards it was nominated for.I believe it is STILL the most successful DVD release of all time to date,and deservedly so!Along with the 10 eps on five discs,each disc contains a story summary,the usual scene selection and language selections,along with a ""field guide"" which includes:an intro to the field guide,soldiers(a blurb on the main characters),an historical timeline,a general map of Europe,a glossary of terms(military jargon,etc)and chain of command which lists the ranks of command from top to bottom,in order.On the sixth disc there is a documentary""We Stand Together Alone"",about 77 minutes long.Also a behind the scenes doc about 29 mins.long,a video on-set diary by actor Ron Livingston(Capt.Dixon),some footage on the premiere of the film in France in June of 2001,little vids of each Easy Company persona and a photo gallery.I cannot recommend this set""Band of Brothers"" highly enough.Although vets and WW2 buffs will get the most out of this set,there is enough plain human drama and emotion in this series to attract just about everyone in every demographic.Very few watching will be able to catch or really care about any mistakes that may have arisen in the series.Its'intelligent and highly crafted story line,its great acting and beautiful soundtrack far and away make up for any shortcomings.A great piece of historical stortytelling that belongs in every one's home!"	5.0	World War Two comes to Life like Never Before	2009-02-26	2	2	0

The exchanges between the soldiers is sharp, realistic and captivating with just enough foul language typical for guys under stress. The two-year story is also historically very accurate which makes this production an added bonus for military historians.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2NOZB6VZCTOI4	Robert I. Hedges	"So much has been written about ""Band of Brothers"" that I am hesitant to comment about an undertaking this magnificent. Following E (""Easy"") Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne throughout their World War Two trials, the production, script, direction, and acting combine to make this possibly the most compelling production about war and the camaraderie of men who have served in combat together that has ever been filmed, and for that we own Stephen Ambrose, Tom Hanks, and Steven Spielberg genuine gratitude. Ambrose wrote the book on which the series is based, and oddly, while good, I didn't find the book in the same league as the series, or Dick Winters' autobiography (which I highly recommend.) The genius here was in the synthesis of excellent scripts, general historical accuracy, a perfect cast, first-rate special effects, and a keen directorial eye, which resulted in a sum far greater than its parts.While I was floored by the entire cast, I have to single out a few for special mention. First and foremost, Damian Lewis as Maj. Dick Winters gave one of the greatest performances in cinema history. Period. There is no way that his nuanced performance could have been improved upon by anyone.  Ron Livingston also gave the performance of a lifetime as Winters' best friend, Capt. Lewis Nixon. We can also thank Livingston for his good humored behind-the-scenes video diaries which are included as extras in the set. Donnie Wahlberg likewise gave a great performance as Carwood Lipton, the most mature of the soldiers, while Neal McDonough perfected the role of the sensitive Lt. Buck Compton, a brave man troubled by the horrors he had endured. Finally, Matthew Settle appears as Capt. Ronald Speirs, an enigmatic warrior, whose legend is (perhaps) bigger than the man himself, and who has some mighty big shoes to fill when Winters departs for a headquarters position. The cast is huge, but suffice it to say that every single cast member was superior in their role.The DVD set comes with numerous features, including a ""Making of 'Band of Brothers'"" feature (which could have been longer in my opinion,) and a superior documentary about the real men of Easy Company, called ""We Stand Alone Together."" Unlike most sets of this size and scope, every single minute is worth watching, re-watching, and truly absorbing. It's amazing what these men did for the world and the cause of freedom, and I am grateful to everyone who participated in this undertaking for helping preserve this important piece of history and American heritage."	5.0	A Stunning, Haunting, And Moving Experience	2010-04-12	3	3	0

Its not rocket science). Simply.. AMAZING!! If you landed on this page, then obviously either you are interested in war movies, or clicked the wrong movie link. Based on a true events this miniseries encapsulates first hand account of US Airbourne squadron that was dropped behind enemy lines in France (after D day). It is a spin-off from a Blockbuster movie Saving Private Ryan played by Tom Hanks. Actually this HBO series was produced by Hanks. From first episode you will get familiar with each character that is unique in their own way. Throught the series you experience different perspective from each soldier that deliver their function and horror they saw in their eyes. Each episode starts with a brief intro from real life survivors, so they give you heads up what you will see in the next hour. Kinda hold your hand. If you love WW2 movies or any war movie for that matter  and you did not see it yet, either you were in a coma and skipped this series, or clicked here by mistake.	5.0	Best mini series I ever saw, it is AMAZING!	2011-03-26	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	By any standard, this is easily one of the finest things ever done about World War II, or for that matter about any war.  The series details the adventures of Easy Company of the 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne from their training in Georgia through D-Day and action in Belgium and into Germany.  The reason that this mini-series is so successful is not hard to determine:  no effort to make it as accurate and as good as possible was spared.  In every detail, the show is as close to perfect as is possible.Who to praise first?  One could easily start with the actors.  The cast is absolutely first rate, and they not only are extraordinarily fine as actors, they also bear an amazing physical resemblance to the real life individuals whom they portray.  If you look at the photos in the Stephen Ambrose book upon which the series was based or watch the documentary WE STAND ALONE TOGETHER, which featured interviews with the survivors of Easy Company, the likenesses are striking.  Although the entire cast is superb, Damian Lewis pretty much steals the whole show as Winters.  I love the quiet competence and confident leadership he projects in all his scenes.  If I were to go to war myself, I would very much like to serve under someone like Winters.  Unbelievably, Damian Lewis is English, which seems scarcely possible his accent is so natural.  Ron Livingston is a wonderful surprise as Capt. Nixon.  I had previously seen him in purely comic roles in SWINGERS and then in OFFICE SPACE, and while he definitely brings a mildly comic tone to this series, it isn't in the end a role that brings nothing but smiles.  Eion Bailey is memorable in his role as Pvt. Webster, the Harvard educated noncom who wants to become a writer.  He also is the character who allowed me to keep alive a boast I make to a friend that I can connect almost any movie or television show to Buffy the Vampire Slayer in one way or another (he appeared as one of the students who took on hyena-like qualities in the episode &quot;The Pack&quot; from the first season).  The rest of the cast is always at least very good.The technical aspects of the film are just off the chart.  The film always looks and sounds great.  Much like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, many of the battle scenes have an almost tactile feel to them.  Some feel so real that I as a viewer felt physically vulnerable.  In a large number of the episodes I had that same sensation of almost being pulled into the film.  In a large number of the battle scenes they employed handheld cameras, and that helped induce a &quot;you were there&quot; kind of experience.  One of the greatest achievements was giving the illusion of the film being shot on location, while in fact nearly the entire film was shot on a huge lot in England.  During filming it was remade constantly to recreate the various locations that were needed.  There were some scenes filmed on location, but far fewer than one would have imagined.All of this excellence meshes together to tell in superb fashion the tales of real human beings.  Throughout one gets the sense that these are ordinary human beings who are called upon by the demands of history to do extraordinary things.  All in all, this is a remarkable achievement, a landmark both of television and of filmmaking about World War Two.  I can't imagine anyone seeing it finding it is any sense a disappointment.	5.0	An exceptional series about a remarkable group of men	2004-01-27	6	5	1

This belongs right up there with the best in the war film genre.  This series came out right before the sonic boom of HDTV so to see this series in all its glory come to the High Resolution arena will be fantastic.  I just recently saw Saving Private Ryan on HDTV and it looked unbelievable.  With Speilberg producing the series, each episode used the same film stock and stylistic look as SPR, thus Band of Brothers must, and will look incredible.  If you have the few bucks to spend, and are a fan of the series, regardless of if you have it already or not, it's DEFINETLY worthwhile to buy, and REALLY nice to upgrade."	5.0	Fantastic!!!	2006-12-25	6	2	4

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3BVLRQYRLP8EQ	Rob	This semi-realistic mini-series has you pulling for the characters the whole way through.  While not particularly 'accurate' as a historical documentary, it's not really meant to be.  It's a drama and it's meant to invoke feelings about a 'band of brothers'.  Which it does masterfully.  From what I've seen and read, it basically pulls the experiences of several people together into a single character.  More bang for the buck as it were.  Most people who give this series a bad review seemed to expect a historically accurate film, but forget that it's not a documentary film.  This film does just what Hanks and (Speilberg?) wanted it to.  It tells a story.  And it's a very good one.  Buy this.  It's well worth watching over and over.	5.0	Not what you expect.	2011-12-30	2	2	0

It is based upon the actual experiences of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the famed 101st Airborne Division.  This first episode finds E Company in training in Georgia under one Captain Sobel.  Sobel both hates and is hated by the men, but has a gift for training.  More would be telling, but the rivalry and eventual reckoning between Captain Sobel and Lieutenant Winters, his Executive Officer, is a great story.  All of this takes place as the Company prepares for the big jump into Normandy on D-Day.Every episode of ""Band of Brothers"" is well worth watching and constitutes superb entertainment.

The movie shows a lot of the bloody violent aspects of war, but I think fails to coherently present the specific events of the war that the story is trying to cover.  There is a lot of short quick conversation which jumps around failing to tie all together into an interesting presentation.  I expected more from a movie that has the name of Steven Speilberg on it.	2.0	Weak Presentation	2014-06-12	5	0	5

It is both about the men who fought the war and the battles they fought. I learned a great deal about the European campaign from watching this and then researching the things that were new to me.The introductions and then the full interviews with the Veterans is not to be missed. These men are so honest in their emotions, their memories and about the job they did in fighting for years for our country. They are all to be admired.Anyone interested in WWII--both battles and about the men who fought them--has got to watch this series.	5.0	Absolutely impactful	2013-01-06	1	1	0

Anyways I went ahead and bought the set and was completely hooked from the very first episode!So much intense action and incredibly emotional situations make this by far the best WWII show I have ever seen. This series follows Easy Company (one of the most famous companies) from the start of the war, to the finish. With accounts and stories from the war heroes themselves, it makes for an incredible series you'll want to watch over and over again. I've watched the complete set twice now, and still loved every second of it. And just as a side note: much of the same equipment and props that were used in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; were used in this series. However, Band of Brothers used ten times as much pyrotechnics for effects than Saving Private Ryan did. In fact, by episode three, they had already exceeded the total amount in which they used in Saving Private Ryan.This is a must have for any WWII buff or not. A great depiction of what the heroes of our country went through for us.	5.0	Simply amazing!	2003-12-19	2	1	1

One has to marvel at the level of commitment to a cause in order to undergo the terrors and horrors that they went through. Nearly all of the episodes brought an accurate portrayal of the feelings and emotions that those wars caused them to have. I was a little disappointed that the episode &#34;Why we fight&#34; didn't look further into what would cause whole communities to look the other way while such atrocities were being committed.

The men portrayed in this Mini Series were truly heroes, even if they do not believe so in themselves.  True, hereos are the ones left on the field, as they say, but to me these men, and what they went through for my freedom make them heroes in my book.From Disc One - which covers training to Disc 6 - which details the  actual men, this series is very, very engrossing!  I've been unable to stop and put these down since starting Disc 1.  I plan on rewatching this series starting next week and plan on showing it to my son as soon as he's old enough to understand what took place in these men's lives.Very moving, and heart pounding, filled with awesome sound effects, so much so that it actually sounds like I'm there when played over my home theatre.Very well done!	5.0	Truly moving experience - you'll watch again and again	2004-01-23	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1KZ7EZIAXUONO	Scott A. Spilker	Band of Brothers is a series that is tough to beat when it comes to drama, excitement, realism, cinematography, sound effects, etc.  This story and its characters really make an impact on the viewer - knowing this is historically accurate just amplifies that attachment.  The only negative thing I can say about this is that the video quality is not what I've come to expect from Blu-ray.  Don't get me wrong - this looks and sounds wonderful.  There is some improvement in video quality over standard DVD, but if you have access to one of the better up-scaling DVD players, you'll not notice too much difference.  The extra features are nice on the Blu-ray set (you need a Picture-in-picture capable player to take advantage of some of the extras).  All-in-all, I highly recommend this set to everyone.  But, if money is tight and/or you don't have access to a PIP Blu-ray player, you may be able to find this in standard DVD format without losing out on much at all for considerably less money...  If you can get the Blu-ray set on a good sale, don't even think twice about picking it up though.	4.0	Awesome series with minor disappointments	2009-02-20	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1FHE8HL0OHSO1	Scott Eaton	Have you read Bret Fetzer's AMAZON review yet? Start there...it's dead on. I'm just here to simply gush on and on about this series. I have never been so moved by a movie of any kind.Because of the mini-series format, the viewer is given the time needed to venture into the minds of the young men of 'Easy Company', an airborne infantry unit that took the brunt of almost every major European battle in WWII.The elaborate character development here is second to none, and you truly get the chance to meet most of the key players in Easy Company. This is what pulls you in. The narrative first person view-point is magnetic.The troops of Easy immediately become your friends, and you worry about them. And for good reason.Band of Brothers takes you to a hellish boot-camp experience where you feel their hatred for Easy Company's overly-brutal Captain Sobel. You get to parachute into the hell of D-Day in Normandy in the middle of the night. You push through France, and reach Bastogne. Bastogne is the most brutal, realistic, and unnerving WWII film-sequence(s) ever shot. You freeze in the foxholes for days with summer gear in the middle of winter and you cover up in your foxholes while you endure countless shellings from the German army. You lose many 'friends' in Bastogne. You were there.I won't ruin the rest...I have to stop myself now as I could go on forever. Band of Brothers went on to receive many awards, but I still think that the amount of publicity it received pales in comparison to what it truly deserved. I read the book 'Band Of Brothers' by Stephen Ambrose (the mini-series is based on the book), and I think this ended up enhancing my 'relationship' with the characters. I'll finish with some very bold statements. This is clearly the best mini-series ever produced, and is also the best war movie/mini-series ever created. It's all in the 'relationships'.	5.0	The Best Mini-Series Of All Time	2003-03-25	1	1	0

Sometimes brutally... ( that's the best way I can describe it without being censored )It shows the sheer boredom and nightmares that everyone experiences in these operations.  It's one of the best &#34;docudramas&#34; I've ever seen on the the subject of combat.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A26A94FRLSGS52	Scott	The best part of this, is that it really goes deep.

From the beginning of the series you really get an idea of how they trained, what it was like, from the 2nd episode on its all chaos, as in, you get right into battle. I've just started to rewatch this series, having it been some time since ive seen it and im still amazed at what these guys went through.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3PAUDX0HPKPU7	Scott McDonald	When it comes to historical retrospectives (documentaries and dramatizations), there can often be an improper emphasis upon politics or philosophy.  This series as taken from the book by Stephen Ambrose of the same name.  Wisely, different episodes were directed and directed by different people.  It provides a nuanced and multi-dimensional point-of-view of events.  If you want to teach what happened during World War II from the perspective of those who were there (not a sweeping summary of the events but a view of what the soldiers saw), this is the best series of its kind.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"The accolades cannot pile up high enough to overwhelm HBO's epic 10-part miniseries, ""Band of Brothers.""  Based on the famous book by the late, great historian Stephen Ambrose, ""BoB"" sets a high-water mark for television.On a personal note, I watched this miniseries after falling in love with HBO's ""The Sopranos"" and watching the first four seasons of that mesmerizing series.  I have to admit that I was a little concerned about going back to the gosh-darn solidity and goodness of the Greatest Generation after being steeped in the murderous cynicism of the Soprano family for a few weeks.  How could the noble soldiers of D-Day compare to the awful, glorious humanity of America's favorite crime family?  I was prepared to slog through ten hours of bland goodness and sacrifice, spiced only by action scenes.I shouldn't have worried.  Stephen Ambrose served as co-executive producer of this series, along with Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and other noteworthy talents.  Gifted writing and directing showed the intimate details of the life of Easy Company as it is forged in basic training and the D-Day invasion and the pounding it took in Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge, and Operation Market-Garden, up through discovering one of the first concentration camps to the taking of Hitler's famed Eagle's Nest in the Alps.  Rather than serve up a bunch of cardboard cutouts, the creative team shows a cast of soldiers full of hopes, dreams, sins, virtues, and flaws.In short, ""BoB"" tells the real story of real men who did amazing things during their 434 days in Europe.  Even though the action scenes are legitimately amazing (often rivalling the best scenes from ""Saving Private Ryan,"" if not surprassing them), the strongest elements of ""BoB"" are the quiet ones.  Whether showing the struggles of a man raised from the ranks to become an officer, or the pain associated with losing a beloved comrade on one of the last patrols of the war, or the fury that only comes from being ordered about by a complete cretin, ""BoB"" captures the essence of what it was to be a ""grunt.""  Ambrose was famously a fan of Eisenhower, Marshall, and the infantryman.  That love comes through in this series in spades.Spicing most of the series are interviews with actual members of Easy Company.  To watch these old soldiers recall these dark days with such humility simply stuns you into silence.HBO has done an amazing thing with ""BoB.""  By focusing on a company that was seemingly everywhere in the Allied advance across Europe, ""BoB"" tells as comprehensive a tale as can be told of our experiences over there.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3HQWLUDFDVOZR	Scott Schriefer	Band of brothers is an extremely detailed look at the experience of war.  Its ten one hour episodes start with the men of Easy Company, 101st Airborne, during the rigors of basic training and the process of becoming soldiers.  From the series' onset the men's youth, exuberance, but also naivety about what is to come, are the subject of a deep introspective look at war and all its tragedies.  The bond that these individuals develop episode by episode is well chronicled, as well as the major operations that Easy Company participated in during the liberation of Europe: D-Day, Market Garden, Bastone, the capturing of Hitler's Eagles Nest, to V-E Day.  The great depth of the characters and their experiences are like no other war movie ever captured on film (granted, the ten hour series length allows for this).  If you liked Saving Private Ryan you'll love Band of Brothers.  I can't sing its praises enough for those of you who want to understand maybe just a small portion of these men's experiences and the horrors of war.  My only caution: the series is graphic in nature due its content.  This is not done for audience effect, merely to correctly document the realities of the condition.  For those viewers that do not care for this level of realism you may want to think twice about experiencing this series, because it truly is an experience.  Otherwise, devote ten hours of your life to Band of Brothers and you will not be disappointed.	5.0	Band of Brothers is Exceptional	2003-03-06	0	0	0

I haven't seen an 88mm dual purpose gun yet, but the Americans are always assaulting them and knocking them out.

The trilogy of The Lord of the Rings, and this DVD set of Band of Brothers. I have now watched this set in its entirety eight times. Every single minute. I have watched the boys from Easy Company turn from being green recruits and volunteers to battle-weary true soldiers.I have marvelled at the perserverance of Dick Winters, and with his unflinching friendship with Capn. Nixon. I have watched in wonder at the grit of all of the guys; Guarnere and Lipton, Heffron and Liebgott, Bull and Moose, Webster, Martin - I have even marvelled at what the replacements went through - and all of the other Brothers. There are not enough remaining words to say how powerful this HBO series is, and how everyone out there needs to view this DVD set.These men were part of this ""forgotten generation,"" but I can state with every fiber of my being that I will never, ever forget what easy Company did, and what the 101st did, and what the 506th PIR did, and what every soldier who served his country did to preserve the sanctity of America. Once you have viewed this series you will never be the same. And so, it is my choice for traveling to see my maker, and in some small way, my way of honoring these men who were so belatedly honored for their part in World War II.

This series along with its companion The Pacific drive home just how much they sacrificed and what it meant for the ones that didn't come home having made the ultimate sacrifice having placed their lives on the solemn alter of freedom.  the men of the greatest generation truly did bleed on every other stripe on americas flag to ensure that they stayed red, and none of us should forget what they sacrificed to stop Hitler and Japan.  Had we lost the war the world would be beyond anyones worst nightmares.  Thank God there were men brave enough to ensure that NEVER HAPPENED.

After five years of wearing out the DVD set of BoB I thought I'd heard it all. And I do not have a dedicated 5.1 surround sound home theatre audio set--just the built-in speakers of my LCD HDTV flat panel. I was blown away. (At one point in Episode 2, I was almost literally blown away.) First of all, the volume seems louder. It may or may not be, but it's just that every sound and sound effect seems to have so much more depth than I remember from the DVD. Snatches of background dialogue can be understood. Animal life, crickets, flies, birds, clear and vivid. The crunch of bootheels, the screech of steel on steel, the impact of shrapnel on stone. And every weapon has a clear and distinct voice--the M1, the M1 carbine, the Thompson, the BAR, the MGs, the mortars, the German K-98s, artillery shells, tank shells ... I could go on. The sound detail and immersion is simply incredible and completely envelops you. Not even mentioning the music. For the first time in years, Michael Kamen's score brought me to tears of sheer direct emotional effect.The new interactive version of the old Field Guide is an excellent resource. I haven't yet heard the real E/506th vets' picture-in-picture commentary; I'll do that on second run-through. BoB has been, since it first showed, the high water mark of the latter-day World War II oeuvre, and one of the best-written shows ever. This Blu-Ray version brings it to life all over again.	5.0	The Sound is Incredible on Blu-Ray	2008-12-17	4	2	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A21DIAD2WCUUW0	Sharon Cook	I don't have HBO and missed this epic when it first aired.  I was able to get Band of Brothers on Amazon Prime this past Friday, which was the 70th anniversary of D-Day.  I had a marathon day of television and watched the entire miniseries.  I had a great Uncle who landed on the beach and survived.  I have a vivid memory from his accounts which were passed down of the horrors of the landing on the beach.  I had heard of the 101st Airborne and the difficulties they endured on that day.  This miniseries brought those difficulties to my eyes, ears and heart like no other accounting I have ever seen.  The men's faces as they were flying to their destiny on that day in those planes, silently, dealing with their thoughts and fears.  It was haunting.  The bravery exhibited throughout the story was far more than any one unit should have to endure during war time.  It makes you realize the horrors of war, but you also see men who have each other's backs literally.  They keep going when most people would just lay down and die.  Their courage and bravery are brought to you with such realism, especially with the commentary from the actual soldiers in the beginning of each episode, as well as the comments posted at the end of each episode.  I would recommend this miniseries to anyone who wants to see the reason for the end of war in our lifetime.  It is easy for politicians to sit back and think we must be the world's police, but these honorable young men have to give their lives, if not their souls, to satisfy someone's lust for power.	5.0	Band of Brothers powerful	2014-06-08	1	1	0

This review is for the product.From the image, and price, I was lead to believe I was purchasing a new copy of Band of Brothers on blu-ray.  My excitement from its delivery was deflated as soon as I opened the box.  Not only was this product previously opened but the outside case was dented.  I think all of the blu-rays are intact but buyer beware, you may get a previously opened product.The only reason I don't rate this product with one star is because Band of Brothers is so amazing.  I have owned this on DVD and wanted to enjoy the series in high def once I got my blu-ray player.If you are thinking about buying Band of Brothers, do it!  You wont be disappointed.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2Z02VWDP9YZQP	"Shawn K. Johnson ""Comm SQ"""	I started watching band of brothers before I left the united states at a friends house.  I woke up one moring made some coffee and sat down to watch a war/film that ended up being an adventure.  As soon as I got to my next assigment over seas it was the first thing I purchased from amazon and I waited home very impatiently till it came in, a week later!  Very fast.  I don't want to talk about episodes in the series because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who is interested in seeing it.  All I want to say is if you get through the entire collection and the series doesn't inpire you to become a better person or fills you with pride then there is something definitly wrong with you.  Highly entertaining and a must see for WWII buffs, or not, alike. I would recommend this collection to anyone even the French HAHA j/k.	5.0	OMG BOB is da BEST!	2008-05-19	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AP3V63JVKLEO5	Sherman A. Thompson	"I doubt that this World War II series will ever be equalled. Many factors had to be brought together to make an epic such as this. Words fail me in an attempt to praise this series sufficiently. After seeing several episodes on HBO I knew I had to have my own copy of the series in its entirety so I could dissect and review it slowly, part by part, at my leisure.I bought the DVD package, then bought a DVD player so I could watch it. It has been worth every dollar invested.The story line and dramatization depicts E company of the 101st ""Screaming Eagle"" Airborne Division from the time it was formed and trained in Virginia, and all the way through the battles it fought, from D-Day to the end of the European war and the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchesgarten.The episodes are pure reality and the events really happened. Most of the dialog consists of the same words as they was actully spoken by the real troopers who somehow lived through it.  This series tends to leave the vewer stunned and pensive for a few minutes after the screen goes blank at the end of each episode. This is largely because the surviving troopers, who are now very old men, supplied first hand accounts of the events depicted, the descriptions of what it was actually like. and much of the dialog, word for word still engraved in their memories after so many years. Each of them was given a copy of the script to review, comment on, and correct. The actors were selected, in part, by their resemblence to the young paratroopers, as they were over fifty years ago.This series should be required viewing in every American high school curriculum. Aside from breathtaking entertainment, it allows the younger generations to see how horrible war can get, and the debt all Americans owe to the young men who fought and died to preserve our freedoms. The only film that even remotely came close was the much shorter WW-1 true story, ""Lost Battallion.""The viewer gets to know the men's names, their personality characteristics, their strengths, and their weaknesses.  The characters eventually become almost like family to the viewer.  When a leg is blown off or a seemingly fatal shot is taken to the head, the viewer is genuinely upset, and later relieved when word comes that the trooper somehow survived in the hospital. This is war reality at its best, without actually being in it.The cinematography and musical score are sensitive and virtually perfect.  The series was filmed in muted color, neither black and white, nor full color, but a perfect blend of both, setting a perfect mood for the time and events. Hanks and Spielberg really outdid themselves on this series. It sets a high water mark for the cinematographer's art in skill, sensitivity, and accuracy.I would add more praise but must stay within the 1,000 word review limit. Nothing I can say can do it adequate justice, anyway.Get this series; you won't be sorry.  But be prepared for a dose of war reality."	5.0	SIMPLY THE BEST WW-2 SERIES EVER MADE;CANNOT BE EXCEEDED	2003-03-24	17	17	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2JDVQ812P8PUL	S. Hong	"Quite possibly.  And maybe the best movie about war ever. Its an expensive set to be sure but for many fans its hard to put a price tag on this level of quality seldom seen on TV or on the Big Screen.The first 5 or so episodes are a bit hard to get into because there are so many characters and it doesn't focus on just a few to build up tension in a standard dramatic fashion.  But by the time you get to Episode 10 and watch the excellent documentary ""We Stand Alone Together""  you'll want to watch the series all over again.  I did, and again and again.  Upon repeat viewings you get a deeper appreciation for all stories and details you didn't pick up before.  Every expression more touching and every words of caution, humour, friendship, and frustration more meaningful.They did a fabulous job of bringing big movie quality to the small screen.  Its no wonder HBO has built such a solid reputation by commiting to projects like this. This series isn't merely entertainment but a fitting monument to the men of Easy Company and moreover all the men and women who triumphed against a World War.  Minor details were changed from the book by Stephen Ambrose but nothing to detract from the overall integrity of the project.  Or perhaps they were factual corrections Ambrose made after the fact?  Regardless, the stories of people like Maj Winters, Nixon, Lipton, Speirs, Guarnere, Liebgott, ""Bull"" Randallman, Webster, and others have touched me deeply in the year 2002."	5.0	The Best WW2 Movie/Series Ever?	2002-11-06	26	24	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2ZDY6WY3MDJVZ	"Sight Reader ""sight_reader"""	"Catapulted by momentum from ""Saving Private Ryan"", the astounding achievement of ""Band of Brothers"" was badly undermined by its ill-timed September 11th premiere.  Based on the book by the late Stephen Ambrose, this HBO series follows Easy Company, an elite American airborne (parachute) company, all the way from training camp to German occupation duty.  The death toll amongst these men was horrific, and reverence for their sacrifice clings onto every frame.  Scattered hopelessly across Normandy, this unit wrenched the crucial town of Carentan from ammo-starved Germans, participated in the massive airborne debacle of Operation Market Garden (rescuing many British paratroopers), suffered horrible losses in at the Battle of the Bulge, held off an ""offensive"" at Haguenau, and finally seized the ""Eagle's Nest"", Hitler's personal luxury perch in the mountains.The highly effective style pioneered by ""Saving Private Ryan"" (steady-cam with washed out colors) suffuses the entire series with a gritty documentary feel.  Occasionally an obvious CGI or studio shot will clash with lush location shooting, but overall the production values are staggering.  Even minor historical details are studiously reproduced, but, like ""Private Ryan"", the camera never wallows in indulgent spectacle.  The miniseries format is used to full advantage to present a truly comprehensive account of war from a wide variety of viewpoints that normally can't be appreciated.  Since the events of history itself do not neatly line themselves up in the sort of dramatic arc viewers are accustomed to, some may leave the series with a sense that it is dramatically uneven.  Each episode, usually a bit over an hour long, is elegantly introduced in both mood and content by interviews with actual survivors from the company.Like the best of war films, the emphasis is not on bloodshed and action, but on human relationship and suffering within the company.  The performances, by a dedicated cast of largely unknown players, are uniformly excellent, but very little help is given to the first time viewer in identifying the multitude of war-weary faces (often, even after several important appearances, a character's full name is never mentioned).  While this can be frustrating for new viewers, it allows for dialogue unencumbered by forced introductions and creates immense replay value, with new insights appearing with every viewing.The character confusion is alleviated nicely by some of the DVD's reference features.  Accompanying each episode is a picture gallery of the important names and faces in that episode, as well as a glossary of terminology and the general locations within Europe.  A somewhat less useful timeline is included, and a few of the most important characters are given nice dramatic collages (perhaps used when promoting the series).The DVD offers 5.1, DTS, and surround sound, all of which are richly spectacular.  Only Spanish is offered in subtitle, and (unfortunately) no commentary tracks accompany any of the episodes.  A 30 minute ""Making Of"" feature briefly describes techniques used in filming in a promotional sort of way, but it is not as promotional as a feature describing the gala screening at Normandy (very few of the veteran's reactions are shown) nor as obnoxious as a Jeep advertisement that somehow snuck onto the disc.Two further wonderful additions are provided in the DVD: a full and moving documentary, consisting solely of the gripping interviews of Easy Company's survivors, and Ron Livingston's (Office Space) thorough and very likeable video diary of the actor's boot camp."	5.0	A miniseries in the tradition of Saving Private Ryan	2002-11-08	5	4	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A8WD11C6SVWYG	simon chivrall	Many people thought that not many war films could reach the brutally realistic environments created in Saving Private Ryan, how they were so wrong!Even though not a film but virtually a continuing 10 hour one, Band Of Brothers has to be one of the most shouted about DVD collection coming out November 2 2002. The series is based upon an American C Company in world war II. They train at home and then find themselves in volved in one of the biggest human assaults in a single day. The Company have been trained as para-troopers who can parachute behind enemy lines and then function as a soldier.The series carries on from there with some very graphic scenes similar to that of Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. Each episode has a kind of sole meaning throughout each, differing from episode to episode. In my opinion it has to be one of the best series on tv and now coming to DVD wil allow us all to view behind the scenes footage of the silming and actors comments.Forget Friends, this series will simply blow you away.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3BLAAIOJXSA53	S. Jessoe	"""Saving Private Ryan"" is based on the story of paratrooper Fritz Niland of Easy Company, 506th PIR, 101st Airborne. Private James Ryan is Fritz Niland. However, Spielberg/Hanks make no mention of Fritz Niland in ""Band of Brothers"", perhaps to prevent contradiction of their 1998 movie. According to Stephen Ambrose, Niland was fighting in the battle outside of Carentan, Normandy (Episode 3) when he was removed from the front line and sent home. The final bridge defense scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" is fiction. Fritz Niland was saved at Carentan.Viewing ""Band of Brothers"" is a life-changing experience. These troopers truly are the ""Greatest Generation"". I am deeply impressed by Dick Winters and Bill Guarnere. They are heroes in every sense. There has been talk of upgrading Winter's ""Distinguished Service Cross"" to ""Congressional Medal of Honor"" for his actions at BreCourt Manor (Episode 2). Even if this upgrade never happens, Winters has succeeded in winning the highest respect of each and every viewer of ""Band of Brothers"".

While watching Band of Brothers I found myself deeply moved by the plite of the 101st Air Borne and the men of Easy Company. It's moving to see these young men(many of them no older than I am) be willing to give their lives for one another, console each other through times of fear and loss, and bravely face a seemingly unstoppable enemy. Most importantly they all gave their lives to protect the freedoms many of us abuse and take for granted everyday. This show is a beautiful testament to their sacrifice. You will laugh and you will cry along with the boys of Easy Company from the moment they land in France all the way to Hitler's Eagle's Nest.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A19SL35AZ2LMD5	SLenny	Simply put, there is no other series that tells a story with such devotion and care that accurately portrays, not only historical events, but the individuals who unknowingly created them. The extra footage and vid-doc's contained, show how the actors interviewed, met and became close friends to the soldiers they were cast to be. And in the case of Bill Garniere, the resemblance is uncanny. It was after watching the series in its entirety (not for the first time, but the first time owning it) that I delved into the included docs and was truly moved to tears. These men, and the countless others not portrayed in this series, were true hero's, putting themselves on the line for their comrades time and time again. They escaped aid stations while carrying injuries to return to their brothers at the front. Yet it is not only heroic events that were immortalized in this series, but the fear and shell shock of individuals at all military, social and psychological levels, coming to terms with the horror and violence of witnessing war at the front line - all the while putting their lives on the line for leaders who were everything from supreme to downright ignorant.To discover now that so many band of brothers have passed away since the series first aired, brought more sadness to me, for I felt for a very short time, that I knew them. At least, I knew them as well as the director's wanted me to. Such is the quality of this production. There is nothing quite like it and I doubt ever will.	5.0	Remarkable heartfelt re-enaction	2013-05-24	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1KYKDQNQ5YXYT	"S. Lu ""sensiblefootwear"""	"...is the most profound legacy of the actions of veterans of WWII, such as those in Easy Company whose heroic exploits against pro-White Germany are documented in Band of Brothers.  It would be hard to come to such a conclusion from a two-or-three-hour film like Saving Private Ryan which--in conforming to narrow plot conventions--presents an abbreviated, textbook example of both the horrors of war and its competing causes (i.e. freedom vs. tyranny), the only things one can divine from brief exposure to such an enormous subject as WWII in the European theater.  With its meandering serialized form, BOB can more accurately depict the totality of life during warfare:  moods, sensations, joys, lust, comraderie, hunger, fear, hatred, compassion, and, most of all, boredom.  The sheer drudgery of war--the monotonous beat of advancing columns, battle prep, attack and counterattack--is simply beyond the scope of any film.  When one is absorbed by the subtleties of BOB, one begins to see the metaphorical forest which, for me, was the forest, or more specifically the color of the forest, and the snow, and the dirt, and the soldiers and their uniforms.  The muted, almost monochromatic color scheme is striking, as is the fact that virtually everyone is white.  Could any of these soldiers even conceive of the world they were bringing about in this battlefield, this ""crucible of time""?  They fought for our freedoms, yes, but our free society is--at least in theory--ephemeral, as political systems may come and go given the current circumstance.  In the aftermath of some staggering disaster, I doubt that a freewheeling democracy would remain when a more authoritarian regime would be better suited for those in need of mere survival.  I am in no way suggesting that the veterans deliberately wanted to alter the racial composition of Western societies, but, that is the ultimate legacy of the outcome of WWII, whether you like it or not.  I would not be surprised if the prescriptively white nature of Euro-theater-themed works is the main reason for their popularity and  continuing creation.  With its non-triumphal tone and lack of Spielberg-ian contrivance, ""Band of Brothers"" is the most poignant of these time capsules."	5.0	MULTIRACIAL DIVERSITY...	2006-07-12	2	1	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AR1NP84PU84D4	S. Melvin	Band of Brothers is likely known for its near real representation of life for the average &#34;Joe&#34; (U.S. military soldier) during World War II.  The cast did a marvelous job of portraying the life and attitudes of the American soldiers during that time period.  The director and crew only helped the matter by bringing the audience right into the picture in a way that, at times, made you feel like you were in the thick of things with the soldiers being represented.This series follows the lives of the soldiers of &#34;Easy&#34; Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, pulling from interviews with veterans from that outfit and sprinkling in a bit of Hollywood flare and pizazz.  The overall effect is a captivating look into the lives of an American soldier and how they handled the most stressful of situations (combat) and the most mundane periods between.  Ever wonder if soldiers enjoyed a little rest and relaxation while in combat?  How about, the sights and sounds of artillery and machine gun fire, while witnessing a tank advancing on your position?  That and much more are captured in this series in, what many military veterans, both old and young alike, have described as the closest you can get to the real thing while still in the comfort of your home.Overall, this collection is worth viewing and includes some great footage from interviews with actual veterans from the war.  Even the &#34;tin can&#34; that holds the movies in reminiscent of old ration containers used during the war - a nice touch to an already nice product.	5.0	Well made, acted, and written story about WWII	2013-10-01	2	2	0

However, after seeing the few episodes that I did, I knew that I wanted to see all of them eventually. I finally bought this recently.While there is great action and pyrotechnics like you would expect in a WWII movie, there also is a lot of heart to this movie as well. The screenplay really tears at your heart strings as you follow these men through training and all the way to the end of the war. Not only do you see their physical pain from their injuries, but you also vividly see the emotional and psychological damage that the war has on them. You are constantly amazed how the men survived this war and you are there with them when they see the friends die on the battlefield.	5.0	A war series with a heart.	2008-01-02	0	0	0

On one review the person states that this was another typical GI Joe movie with a happy ending. And even though the ending was relatively &quot;happy&quot; this is not just another GI Joe war movie this movie is about a Band Of Brother as stated in the title. I also look at the fact that the movie ended on a peaceful sunny day. That doesn't make it a happy ending, many of their friends or even better, BROTHERS had died and that is not HAPPY AT ALL!

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3IBWZPMGMRDHB	Spartan Warrior	Band of Brothers is a true story told by the survivors of easy company of the 101st airborne during World War 2. It begins in boot camp, and it spans all the way to the end of war, when the men hear about Japan's surrender.This blu-ray version has great picture, it almost has the same quality as planet earth but what this blu-ray version of the series shines in, is the sound. Mind you, I never owned the dvd version but I have never heard such sound quality from any other dvd/blu-ray I own. The explosions sound very real as does the bullet whizzing too. Also, in the 1-2 parts when the troopers are in the c47 planes, it sounds just like you're in the airplane together with them.Overall this series has it all for the action/war film fanatic. Even though it has great picture/sound quality, I wouldn't recommend if you own the dvd version already. However, if you saw it on tv, or you've never seen it but you like action films or war movies, then this is definitely a must have. The price is also a steal since I bet you won't find another blu-ray set (of such quality) of 6 discs for [...].	5.0	Great Picture and Sound	2009-10-05	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3MRAU4A8LTGLY	Spencer	While I appreciate the bad reviews of this mini-series (I always look at those first to gain a real objective view of material befire I purchase it) I cannot help but be a little upset by the reviewers that say that this is yet another &quot;Americans beating the badguys&quot; &quot;Rambo-esque&quot; &quot;War glorifying&quot; etc. picture churned out by the Spielberg-Hanks propaganda machine.  Some of you who have watched this series and commented on it's inaccuracies and Ambrose's failure to make solid his book by using more sources just don't get it.This movie is not about glofiying war, it is not about America beating the bad-guy, it is not about being a WW2 documentary.  It is about a group of men relating their stories.  What they remember about a great hardship in their lives.  I think that Ambrose does these men a little justice and mercy by letting the storytellers tell their experiences and not tearing them down for the sake of accuracy.  Let the men tell it how they remember it.  It gives us in a younger generation some insight to how it was for these men, not neccessarily whether they were on this side of germany or not.  It is not a portal into the past for the sake of preserving history, it is a portal into the past through the eyes of those who lived it for the sake of preserving their memories.I did not really get the idea that this film was about glamorizing the American war machine.  Those who watched this movie and saw G.I.Joe, Rambo, Discrimination against Germans must already have a deep seeded hatred for American and it's foreign policies.  Germans running away or surrenduring to the Americans was common.  Those who have actually read through the history of the Europan Invasion know that the German army was under a great deal of stress.  Allied bombings kept supplies at the rear and most surrenduring Germans were just looking for an end to fatigue, suffering, etc.  Furthermore, the men portrayed in this film state how much respect they had for the German army as a worthy opponent.  What I saw most in this film was the loss, hardship, friendship, and horror that these men survived.  If you watch the interviews and documentary in part 11, you see that these men were forever changed by what they did and experienced.  They lost friends, they lost family, they lost their innocence.  I enjoyed this series not for the action or the violence, but for the stories from those who were there.  What they saw, and what it meant to them is what drives this movie.And to those in Europe who are giving this movie a bad review for propping up the American &quot;Sport&quot; of war, I say unto you: You are welcome.Enjoy your Fuhrer-free freedom brought to you by the American armed forces.	4.0	Some reviewers just don't get it.	2004-03-15	66	55	11

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A36AK2ANKSJQYN	"S. Polzin ""toxxicgeneyus"""	So many reviewers here miss the major point, even though their reviews are appropriate. Even with a goal as important as defeating the Axis powers in WWII, the army knew (knows) full well that, when the shells and bullets start flying, geopolitical goals are not likely to keep a &quot;bunch of men&quot; in battle for long. The only hope of getting people to do what the men of Easy Company (and countless others) did is to get them to care about and rely upon each other as much as (or more than) a &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; do.I think the major point of the movie is, &quot;look, here is what it takes (boot camp, world situation, some particularly awful battles/campaigns, etc.) to get a very disparate group of men to care about each other more than they will care about anybody else the rest of their lives&quot; (which the veterans repeat over and over). And thankfully for us, they did! It's why they still cry when recalling their lost buddies even after 50+ years--many people will not get that emotional when recalling the death of a family member after just a few years. And yes, there were certainly just as dramatic and heroic stories on the German (Italian, confederate, N. Vietnamese, etc., etc.) side, but this is not necessarily a movie about WWII. It's a movie about a &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, and what it took for them to &quot;adopt&quot; each other--it just so happens that there were a number of well-documented, especially compelling events in WWII that demonstrate the concept particularly well. Perhaps it's also a lesson to dictators, men will ultimately fight more courageously  for each other (and by extension, democracy) then they ever will for each other PLUS a fuhrer, or emperor. It's cliche, but the series does show, extremely well, both the absolute best and absolute worst of human nature. Thankfully it concentrates on the best!	5.0	Note the title!	2004-04-16	10	8	2

I am impressed about the high quality of almost everything: the actors are very good, the equipment looks very close to the original (as far as I can say), and the mood of war is transportated to the observer very well (or terribly, from the point of the observer). And even one typical ""US-war-film""-stereotype is missing: the Germans are not ugly and bad... But unfortunatly, others remain: the Germans are stupid in every way of the word and love to run into enemy fire. I came to the question: what was the problem at all about Germany in 1939 to 1945? And what did US-troops learn from the Germans, that they still teach it at military-accademies?? They were just hordes of gun-food...

I watched one hour a night for 10 nights straight with my mother, she's not a big fan of war films, and I was afraid she wouldn't like it...but after every episode, she looked forward to the next one as much as I did...One thing, I thought the casting was fantastic.  I read Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose before buying the DVD set, and the actors all seemed to fill the roles of their respective characters almost exactly as I imagined it...  The special features disc also added more than 2 hours of good viewing time to the series.This is a set that I want to share with all of my friends, but at the same time I cherish it so much I'm terrified to lend it out!  It's the best film/mini-series I've ever seen.	5.0	Simply Amazing...	2003-01-29	0	0	0

I've wanted to buy Band of Brothers for about ten years and I finally got around to doing so.  I am a history buff of World War Two and this series hits the nail on the head.

Good fighting and gore, good collection of different characters. The best scene I think was in replacements episode where Shermans ran into a Tiger and Jagdpanther.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AYBFN8Q51GWGS	S. Taylor	"I would like to give a mental salute to all those brave men AND women who died in figting in War World II. The History Channel just gave a presentation of the ten episodes. They were extremely beautiful. As I have written before, it was not about war or ""blood, guts, and glory."" It was about the relationship of the men (soldiers). Their relationships are what held them together. As repeated throughout the episodes and made famous by a Civil War captain: War is Hell. Easy Company went down the hills and through the valley of the shadow of death.Tom Hanks' episode focusing on Mr. Winters and the one about Bastogne and Easy's Christmas in the forest were my favorites. They made me shed a tear, especially when a character I liked and turned on the show to see was killed or injured. One falls down. And then you realize it's the relationships of the soldiers that keep you watching. When you watch a character you really liked and loved to watch, die or get injured, it hits you in the gut. What if I had lived back then and had to fight. If I had been born at that time period and had to serve, hopefully I would serve with soldiers like these.God Bless Easy Company and all the heroes of World War II."	5.0	Brothers Through War	2004-04-23	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A255R9XKPNMQK2	"Stephen B. West ""SBW"""	What can be said about this series that has not already been said? In my view, this is probably the best thing ever produced for TV and is also one of the greatest films ever made. If you have not seen this, then you need to. It should be required viewing for every American. As well as film can do it, this series gives you some sense of the what the people that fought in the European Theater in WWII went through and the incredible sacrifices they made. No film or book can do that complete justice but this film comes as close as I believe anything can. Since 2001 I have watched this 10 part series in it's entirety on or around Memorial Day or the D-Day Anniversary. This is the first time I have watched it using Amazon streaming. The quality and reliability of the Amazon Streaming was at least as good as DVD and in someways more convenient.I highly recommend this film series about WWII. As I said earlier it should be required viewing for any American over 12. The Amazon streaming quality was excellent and if it is available I will watch it using Amazon streaming the next time I watch Band of Brothers.	5.0	One of the best films ever	2014-06-12	1	1	0

But this series is a great picture at how war was.We are actively fighting the War on Terror on two fronts- Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. cringes at two soldiers dying in a single day... Watch Band of Brothers and you'll see that WWII soldiers died at an exponential rate according to today's standards.We as a society no longer have the stomach, nerves or courage to face a war like World War II.Mind you our service men and women do, but we as a nation can't hack it. We complain when a military campaign isn't instantly successful, but then we tell the Commanding Officers when and how they can engage the enemy.During World War II you see a united America willing to let the military do what they do best on the field of battle. The U.S. backed the troops 100% with support back home and the necessary enabling rules of engagement for the front line soldiers to do what needed to be done to end an evil campaign.It wasn't easy. Soldiers died and so did civilians, but lives were saved too. As you see at the end of the BoB series, the lives saved were ones that common people who lived nearby were ""ignoring"" or thought were ""worthless.""The men and women in the field did what needed to be done to win and be the heroes we as a nation knew they were... and are today."	5.0	Band of Brothers is gritty, thought provoking and dramatic...	2010-12-27	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	ABVULUZ2ILKKO	Stephen Ressel	Lots of Hollywood efforts toward dramatizing WW2 look too glossy, make the death too sanitized or far flung gore.  Human relations are usually lost, and love stories thrown in to grab the girls.  It becomes about the grit, the determination, and the supermen on the line.  But, in this mini-series you get actual relations of people in the military ranks, to leadership, to each other, and shows them dealing with the chaos of war in a very human approach and without piles of blood and intestines strewn through the shots to hammer home the idea that someone died.Made by the 'Private Ryan' heads, I found this film much better.  'Private Ryan' was rather boring.  It did what it had to do - punctuate the hell of D-Day, and then get you into the closer fighting in towns, and the lack of orientation that must happen in heated battles.  But 'Ryan' seemed like a comic book compared to this adaptation of a book by a US soldier in WWII.  'Band Of Brothers' takes you through the entire experience of the war, and makes it work by making a stew of solid entertainment crafted from great acting, great writing and script editing, great directing (most times), great lighting, great effects, great characters, great settings, and wonderful detail.  Is it precisely historic?  Who can really say?  The Euros and war-sissies always get strung out on anything that isn't their view of events from a distant seat.  From what I know of WW2 and how people are under pressure in situations of danger, this sure seems absolutely plausible.  But, what does it matter?  The purpose of this is to create an escapism drama wrapped around real people and events.  And it succeeds 110%.The weakest facet of most all dramatic simplifications of complex histories is that they can easily lose many people that are not intimately aware of the geography, time line, or greater events surrounding the subject portrayed.  'Band of Brothers' would have really been aided by the old standard of a map with arrows animating along to show how the troops were progressing, or where they were at every part of the story (usually beginning of episodes).  It really was getting confusing during the battle of the bulge when the 101st was surrounded, but you never get the idea they were truly surrounded or cut off, and have no idea where this all is taking place; fox holes, town, blue lighting, yellow lighting, two worlds apart, people say things, we can't tell what is going on, somehow it is connected.Despite the nay saying, this really does show a lot of the earthy and practical attitudes of Americans under fire.  Some falter, some crack, some die, some harden themselves, some are afraid, some fool hardy, and true to the history they make it work by applying pressure and standing ground.  You can tell how everyone is changed by the war, and how most will go back home and have trouble sleeping for decades to come after all they were through.  Contrary to the soldier who commented a while back, I remember seeing a documentary that related how Eisenhower came into Berlin, or some part of Germany at the end of the war, saw the unshaven, sloppy, dirty, US soldiers contrasted against the clean, proper lines and energy of the Germans, and said something like, 'We have to do something.  Our soldiers look like sacks of garbage.'  And thus, Ike got the army uniform trimmed.  'Band' shows the men slowly becoming dirtier, more unkempt, and scattered through the heavy battles up to the end of the war when they cleaned up very well after the pressure was off.  I don't envy the men of WW2, but I sure do thank them for a job well done.  And I thank Hanks/Spielberg for dramatizing it so effectively.	5.0	Greatest WW2 Dramamentary ...	2006-12-16	2	1	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2F2CVSK9AE2OF	Stephen Sarkisian	There has never been a finer movie about WWII. It shows the special bonding that only takes place between men who have experienced combat together.  From the haunting theme music to the excruciating combat scenes, this was a compelling presentation of the power and pain of war. No other television program has so well demonstrated the overwhelming confusion and chaos that takes place in war or how a group of men, under stresses that would make most of us crack, could overcome their own fears and the forces arrayed against them.  The world owes its honor and respect to the men of Easy Company and the rest who gave their youth and their lives to overcome the Evil of their time.  To those who find the stresses and struggles of life today unbearable, especially those born after WWII, I suggest you watch this series and discover the difference that  courage, committment, and the dedication of a Band of Brothers can make in this world. May we never forget their sacrifices!	5.0	Best of the Best	2002-11-15	3	3	0

This is, in my opinion, the single best production ever completed dealing with that conflict. Although I will always have great respect for ""Saving Private Ryan"" as the film that reopened the interest in this conflict, the ""Band of Brothers"" series matches and, in my opinion, surpasses that film because it is all true. If you are a WWII buff or even just marginally interested, this is worth owning and watching several times--all the time remembering that these are characterizations of REAL PEOPLE... as the ad says, ""...ordinary men who were asked to do extraordinary things..."" so we could all enjoy the freedom we currently (many of us) take for granted. This is a film series that is at once moving, historically informative, entertaining and a tribute to men who never asked for one, but richly deserve one (at least one).

With obvious reverence for its subject, BAND OF BROTHERS follows Easy Company from boot camp through many of its engagements in the major battles in Europe to the end of the World War II.The special effects are stunning (there's no other word for it) and the battle scenes are the best I've ever seen.Its attention to detail and adherence to the facts make it a difficult viewing experience at times.  Because of casualties and replacements, there are a number of characters to track.  Also, the battle scenes are very confusing sometimes.  These aren't necessarily knocks on BoB - soldiers are wounded and die, the definition of battle is ""violent confusion.""  Sometimes coherence is the first casualty of an adherence to the facts.  These are minor quibbles, and if you're like me you'll rewatch these episodes sooner than later, anyway.Be aware - BAND OF BROTHERS also contains a number of scenes containing graphic carnage.  It doesn't dwell on them, but the camera doesn't turn its head when a character is wounded.This is the most realistic depiction of war I've ever seen apart from documentary films.

What makes Band of Brothers most interesting is that these are real accounts based on actions and stories by real people.  The included documentary, featuring interviews with real Easy Company veterans, provides the supporting sense of realism captured in all ten episodes.  Band of Brothers will make you truly admire and respect the men of Easy Company, and all other soldiers who fought the great wars.This is top-notch stuff, particularly the action scenes that stop at nothing to make you feel like you're living the experience. By the end of the ten episodes, you feel like you've developed a bond with each of the characters.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1TRSU2QLH7VU	Steven Myers	Band of Brothers, in my opinion, is one of the greatest productions depicting some of the events that occurred to the 101st Airborne during World War II.  The following of Easy Company beginning with basic training through the end of the war instill thoughts of anger, exhilaration, and sadness as they go through many different trials.  The series gives a name and face to the many faceless soldiers, and how they overcame their paralyzing fears to become an effective soldier.  It even lends an entire episode to the character building of one such soldier though he is killed in the end.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A30ROBQY2PHTGA	Steve Shalaby	This series had been recommended to me by so many people, but I just could never get into a scripted mini-series, don't know why, but it's just me. Anyway, at the incessant nagging of a fellow collector, I finally watched the first episode on Amazon Prime last week. Wow! What an amazingly well written and researched program! For me, the biggest thing is that a director get the equipment right (unlike the disaster that was History Channel's &#34;World Wars&#34;, but that's another story). These guys were spot on. From the paratrooper shaving the Mohawk early in the first episode, to the mention of the brass knuckles (likely referring to his 1918 trench knife), to the M1 carbines and M1A1's carried by the troopers.Way to go, Tom Hanks and Stephen Spielberg...outstanding production....can't wait to see more of the series!	5.0	Should've watched this a long time ago!!	2014-06-16	0	0	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A8NMQBPVX4LR9	"Steve Sjogren ""Author-Serving Coach - Kindnes..."	I'm a big film and documentary buff - have thousands of DVDs (close to 6,000) in my collection.  Hey, when you live in Ohio and winter hits, watching movies is the only way to avoid getting depressed!  This is an amazing movie that is certainly worth watching not once, but over and over again.  I am careful when I make a DVD purchase - I only buy movies that I am sure that I and my family will enjoy multiple times due to the cost of the film.  When Band of Brothers first came out on DVD, and I had seen most of it on HBO previously, so without hesitation I bought it.  This is first rate storytelling.I am a big fan of WW II movies and follow details regarding accuracy closely.  From all that I have read regarding this most-important event of the 20th century, this film nailed the accuracy issue in all regards.  It was fast moving.  At no point did it cause me to look at my watch (which I often do when watching movies to tell the truth!).  In fact, for 90% of all of the DVDs in the set I was on the edge of my seat - no kidding!Someone on this site has already pointed out, very patiently and helpfully, the content of the story so I won't bother doing that.  But suffice it to say, that as someone who is much more critical than your average viewer of movies and DVDs - I was blown away by this one.Also, I have a movie crisicism group that meets each month at my house (I have a high-end movie theater in my basement).  This film has made it onto the list of what we will be watching in 06 - that's saying a lot.  This group is made up of a dozen similar-minded critical viewers as me.  We certainly don't watch just anything that comes along.  After watching the movie we discuss the film at length, the production elements, the actors' other films, the quality of the camera work, etc.  If a film can make it to the list of this critical group, that's quite a compliment.	5.0	"This is a ""Can't Miss"" film!

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A17639YIJLDS1G	still searching	Based on Stephen Ambrose's account of a group of paratroopers' progress from D-Day through to the end of the war the series is an incredible viewing experience as we witness the great sacrifice and bravery of the men of Easy Company, part of the 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army. Those men went through hell as they were asked to do what no-one should expect other human beings to do on their behalf; yet still it continues.The series is split into 10 episodes beginning with the raw recruits' training camp through to training for D-Day in England, D-Day itself, Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge to the `liberation'of Berchtesgarden where Hitler had his Bavarian country retreat. At the time it was the most expensive TV mini-series ever made and it shows. The production values are superb and the action brilliantly realized. But it is the individual stories that really grip against the backdrop of the momentous events the series describes.This has to be one of the most extraordinary and finest television productions in history and what lends it historical credibility is the inclusion of some of the surviving members of Easy Company who comment at the start of each new episode. An added bonus is the final documentary on the last disc with the real BoBs describing their own individual experiences.Avoiding the touches of schmaltz that sometimes mar Spielberg's films this is, for once, a production that really does live up to and exceed the hype! Spielberg and hanks should be congratulated by successive generations.	5.0	Incredible!	2014-02-14	1	1	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1JMW5C46MEE6E	Stratman	Picked this up from Amazon on Bluray at a great price. I had been wanting to watch this for a long time. Well, I finally did. And this is one extraordinary series. Once I started watching it, I could not stop. The acting is uniformly superb. No big box-office names, but you will recognize many of the actors. Great pacing and continuity on the story. First rate special effects. As we're introduced to the people in this, we begin to know and care about all of them. Donnie Wahlberg really is an excellent actor. Though his brother Mark has had more box office success, I think Donnie is a more well-rounded and nuanced actor. Also retired Capt. Dale Dye is in this. He is always good. While others pretend to be military, all he has to do is be himself. From start to finish, an emotional and entertaining masterpiece. If you like war/military movies or series, this is the one to watch. It won't be the last time I watch it.	5.0	Saving Private Ryan On Steroids	2009-02-20	0	0	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A14DLUP03HSWKX	"Street Doc 911 ""Doc"""	"This is a set of DVD's that I'd been waiting to get my hands on ever since the orginal HBO airings of the mini-series; but once it came out, I didn't have the huevos to put out that kind of money. But it's mine now, so for those few who've never seen it, here's a brief synopsis. Produced by Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Steven Spielberg (Schindler's List), this is one for the history books...literally. It's the true story of Easy Company, an airborne division that air dropped behind enemy lines the night before D-Day. Their history is detailed from the night of the drop through their final action of taking Hitler's Bertchesgarten (the Eagle's Nest, his mountain retreat). What separates this from the multitude of WW II movies is that, before each episode, surviving members of Easy Company at time of filming told their personal stories. As time continues, anyone involved in any theatre of the campaign will be gone; and it's that personal history that needs...MUST be preserved.Great soundtrack, very realistic; to the last detail. Very well researched and documented.Drawbacks: Price (it ain't your bargain bin product yet, but you get a lot of for what you pay!). The battle scenes are graphic, but war isn't pretty; and I'm glad the producers opted for real rather than sterile. I'm not a fan of the ""handicam"" view, as it causes a vertigo feeling when you view it (at least to me; make your own conclusions). It's long, but best viewed in one sitting...hard to do, but worth your time.If you don't get that lump-in-your-throat, misty-eyed feeling during this film, check your heart and make sure you still have one!Make it a tradition to watch this on on Memorial Day, at the minimum. Honor those who have made it possible for you to be here in the first place, let alone to see it in relative freedom. God bless the men of Easy Company, the veterans of every war, and those still fighting today for their country and for the sake of others; and for the ideals of freedom and democracy."	4.0	Band of Brothers	2009-04-27	4	3	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1ETUNYLSMOAU6	"Strephon Kaplan-Williams ""writer"""	Band of Brothers Unfortunately Still Glorifies War - Having seen it through again I love the documentary style, but then I realized I was being deceived. It still glorifies war for those who survive. They want Winters to get an even bigger medal than he already got. Giving medals for killing people has got to be looked at. I don't deny the hell those men went through, and how terrible Hitler and the German army were, but in this picture the Germans are pictured unrealistically. The German officer is allowed to keep his sidearm, his gun? Come on. I have read the real story by a Jewish resistance fighter and they knew for a fact how the German officers bragged about the number of Jews they had killed with their hand guns. You cannot believe the atrocities committed by German officers and men. BofB gives the impression that German soldiers were just doing their duty like American soldiers. There is the surrender speech of a German officer to show his men are just like the American men, a band of brothers. So I don't get that this movie is realistic as to what the Germans were like under Hitler and Nazism. Also, we hear only about the old soldiers who made it in civilian life, but where is Guarnere, the guy who had his leg blown off? Where are the others who survived but are casualties of war in civilian life? Did I miss Guarnere's old age story? I hate to think what the effect of this movie is on young men who might want a war to fight in and survive in. Seems like the film is saying, we can't glorify the Viet Nam War but we can glorify the Second World War. All Quiet On The Western Front is still the best war movie, to my mind, because it shows the realism of the soldiers' minds and not just the action. The big question still is, what in the human psyche makes people go to war and kill each other? What happens to all the young soldiers that simply are not good killers, that are not mentally equipped to kill other human beings? They lost a lot of replacements in Easy Company, but did they ever say it in the film that most of these victims maybe were not cut out to kill other human beings? Did they say that  these easily dead in war might be the best sort of human beings? War is hell, but are there any war films yet that show the hell that is war? I hope teachers and parents and friends will help people see that Band of Brothers has its difficult issues, as well as its tough but good character points. Killing is still killing, no matter how you portray it. To be truly realistic in war you have to show men's minds. The educated men in this film were laughed at. Can you believe it? No talk from them whatsoever! Who wrote this film anyway? Who directed it, produced it, and what was the point?	4.0	Band of Brothers Unfortunately Still Glorifies War	2005-09-01	52	5	47
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2H4CSDWLH2K5F	Stuart	"I've never written a review for Amazon before but I have to reply to the two aberrations already posted on the site.This is the dramatisation of the US Army's 101st Airborne Division wartime exploits in WWII. It neither trivialises nor glorifies any aspect of this conflict.It focuses on 'Easy' Company, beginning with their training in England; their deployment on D-day; their crucial involvement in the Ardennes, on to the ultimate fall of Nazi Germany.It shows the soldiers as real people, not as caricatures as the other reviewers stated. We see their fears, hopes and failures. I thought the series was brilliantly acted by a largely unknown cast, the only actor that was instantly recognisable to me was David Schwimmer (Friends) as the hapless Captain Herbert Sobel.Before each episode we see a prologue where the ACTUAL men involved give an insight into different aspects of their experiences. This impressed me as we not only get see a dramatised (for example) Capt. Winters but also get to see the real man. I think this went a long way to convincing me of the accuracy of the series. I doubt these men would have been involved if it were ""just another american war movie"" described by the other reviewers.I watched it TV & couldn't wait for the DVD release which is excellently presented in its own metal box.I thoroughly recommended this release and before anyone posts any similar reviews to the other two, they should remember that if it wasn't for these men and their 'Band of Brothers' none of us would have the freedom of speech to belittle their sacrifice."	5.0	Totally disagree with the other two reviewers	2003-04-15	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	ANHUAM1QA00I9	Student	"I am 18 years old and have recently watched BoB for the first time, and the affect that it had on me was profound. The story of the Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division was portrayed so incredibly real that I felt like I was there with these men, experiencing their fears and anxieties. And getting to know the characters in the movie made me feel closer and gave me such an appreciation for our service men who are out fighting. The blood that was spilt, the lives that were given, and the comradeship shared evoked so much pathos. BoB shows the physical, emotional, and mental strain that is placed on these soldiers by the effects of war. It is grueling and full of heartache. You see this on their faces. I have never been in war and don't know the ""reality"" of it - but this to me shows the many sides and ""realities"" of war that we hear about from veterans but rarely see in other war movies.I agree with the reviewer who stated that no high school student should graduate with out seeing this. I whole-heartedly agree. It has made me so grateful for our freedom and the men and women who sacrifice their lives to insure us of that.And for those who have said that this movie was ""American Propaganda"" or that it resembles ""teen melodrama"" and over-glorifies American soldiers, I would like to say that I am ashamed that such people live in our country. Although this is not a documentary, one would hope that you would have a shred of gratitude in remembrance of the reason that you live enjoying liberty. If you think that this is something that ""teens do on their spring break"" I recommend you actually knowing what you are talking about before you express it. What a sickening comparison. Why don't we shove a gun in your hand and push you out of a plane and into Iraq and see how long you hold out, if you're so convinced that they wouldn't have lasted 24 hours.For those of you interested in buying or watching BoB I would recommend it more than any other movie I have ever seen.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1FB12UKWEHWM6	Suzanne C. Saenz	Band of Brothers is a must see for all Americans, young and old. With the WWII veterans who actually lived through this war and these battles commenting on the episodes throughout the series, there is no better a teacher for those of us who weren't there to be able to have somewhat of a sense of what the average American citizen had to go through for the benefit of all humanity. I believe it is safe to say that many more people, civilians and soldiers alike, would have died had it not been for these men and what they were willing to do for America and the world, and the world would be a much different (worse) place today had these men (and all other Allied soldiers) not been in that place at that time.  I can only offer my sincere thanks and gratitude to the veterans who fought for the greater good, and  to Steven Ambrose, Tom Hanks and all the veterans who came forward to tell this most important story to the world so those of us who came after can learn the many lessons that WWII has taught, and continues to teach, us.Suzanne SaenzTucson, Arizona	5.0	Band of Brothers - A must see for all Americans	2002-08-28	4	3	1

Watching this is like sitting next to him in the hospital on his last few days listening to him rant about this and that.He later became a city cop for Harrisburg, Pa.He passed on very proud of his work in the army and very proud of the men he was there with.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AHL3ES7DCWZJC	TaRan	Band of Brothers is a wonderfully written and acted series. I really enjoy war movies (I'm not sure why), and this one kept me on the edge of my seat for all ten episodes. I just could not stop watching it.The story takes place during World War II. It follows a group of soldiers from boot camp, through the end of the war. The story is very detailed and intricate. I like how the characters develop and how attached to them I become; which brings heartache when one is killed during the course of the series. And I absolutely love how the actual survivors from Easy Company introduce the episodes and provide commentary.Another thing I loved about the DVDs/blu-rays themselves are maps and ranks. You can view maps of each episode, and track Easy Company's movement throughout the world and what battles happened where. You can also view the various Army ranks and what it takes to get the rank.The blu-ray quality is superb. The picture is clear and crisp, and the audio will blow you away. Especially if you have surround sound, you can hear the bullets whizzing by and the mortars all around.	5.0	Best War Series/Movie Ever	2010-01-21	1	1	0

This is the story of a group of paratroopers who jumped on D-Day and fought their way across Europe.  The stories are great, the action is intense and the acting couldn't be much better.The DVD is full of extras, including interviews with the veterans and the actors who portrayed them in the series.  If you enjoyed Saving Private Ryan, you'll love this one.  I've talked to several people who saw it and haven't talked to anybody yet who didn't love this series.I was hooked by the end of the first episode.  It starts a little slow, showing the training these guys had to endure before going into battle, but I still enjoyed the first episode quite a bit.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A36MD4KAVIPLB2	T. Cramer	This is absolutely the best blu ray title available and you get 6 discs for $50 or less.  The video is amazing and will really show you what your TV can do, especially the black levels.  It may not be that amazing, color-popping nature show but it is supposed to replicate wartime footage with a grainy and 'faded color' appearance, and that it does extremely well.  If you watch this with at least a 5.1 sound system prepare to be in for a treat.  Band of Brothers utilized surround sound technology better than any other movie/show I've ever seen and you will here bullets whizzing by and mortars detonating all around you.I'm not going to go into how great the storyline is because more than likely if you are purchasing this, you've seen it before.  There are also many other reviews that describe just how great this series is.  For around $50 you get almost 10 hours of WW II - you really can't go wrong.  This is my favorite movie/series of all time and I highly recommend it to anyone.	5.0	One of the Best Blu-Rays Available	2008-12-23	1	1	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3SW3WMDMH3IJU	TCSC	"I bought Band of Brothers to share with my Son who was having trouble understanding the mixed feelings our family (and most families) have with the violent 1st person shooter video games he and his adolescent friends price so highly (eg Modern Warfare - Black Ops).  He had recently read Under War Torn Skies by Laura Elliot which is a fairly realistic book (historical fiction) about a young American bomber pilot who was shot down over enemy lines in occupied France near the German and Swiss boarder. He was very impressed by this book (and I was surprised to find that it was recommended reading for middle school students given the semi-mature subject matter) but I new I had a chance to do some real educating to put both the historical setting of that book and the violent nature and costs of war into some greater perspective for him.  He usually resists anything I recommend but here we were able to do some very important sharing about what it means to be a man, to be a soldier, and in some ways to be an American.Suffice it to say, my instincts were correct.  Obviously he enjoyed it, we bonded, and he now has a whole lot to think about with regards to violence, war, military service, heroism, humanity, inhumanity, pain, love, comradery and loss.  I have found yet another way to respect and admire both the real people who fought in the war and the people who saw to it that the series was made as perfectly as it is.  Tom hanks may have a bunch of Oscars and SNL appearances, but getting this made is the greatest thing he has ever done in his career.That being said, I should probably comment on my choice to by the series in Blue Ray rather than DVD.  On our current set (a 60"" 720p rear projection set and a 6.1 audio system with full sized speakers) there isn't a tremendous amount of difference in picture and sound quality between BD and DVD.  However I wasn't willing to risk feeling later that I might have missed something by going with DVD, even though in that format I would be able to loan the disks out to more of my family.  My favorite part of this release has been the pop-up commentary mode where you not only hear, but see the surviving easy company members talking about there experiences related to the part of the story playing in the background.  These pop-up interview segments are timed so that you don't miss any significant action or dialog, but you do learn a lot more of the background and specific circumstances surrounding the action.  I find it also helps in identifying who is who among the survivors in that the pop-up are captioned with their names whereas the prologue interview sections for each episode usually don't identify the individual speakers.  This was a nice addition to the experience I have had watching the series as it is played on HBO.So I can't recommend this highly enough.  It's a classic and this is the best format you can get it in."	5.0	Unbelievably Great!	2011-04-26	4	4	0

There is a 3 part war series on History now but it kind of screws up by giving MacArthur 5 stars at the beginning of the war.  Also, Patton was a very tall man (for a tank) but they have a shorter version of him playing the part.  There is only one season of Band of Brothers.

A few scenes differ just slighty from the Ambrose book. Perhaps to make the series more fluid or add more value. My only gripe is that the set comes in a neat little ammo can like tin(which is fine).

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2LET4JF7QT6A3	The Filmslinger	"So I had bought Band of Brothers last year on dvd and enjoyed it very much, but then Blu-Ray struck. I sold the dvds and bought the blu rays, and what a difference! The sound, picture, and features of the blu ray trump the very good dvd version. The crown jewel of the Blu Ray is the bonus feature ""In the Words of Easy Company"", which allows the viewer to listen to commentary from the real soldiers as we watch their characters in each episode. Actually hearing Dick Winters speak of an event while we watch a recreation of that event is brilliant, and truly completes the experience. All in all, the dvd version of Band of Brothers is very good, but if you've got a few extra bucks and a blu ray player, go for the blu ray edition."	5.0	Blu-Ray Review	2009-01-20	3	3	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1VH6QWC6JZRAC	The Guardian	"This 6-disk-in-tin-box Blu-Ray edition of possibly the greatest TV drama series ever made is the one to go for. Five disks each contain two episodes of the series and the sixth disk of extras includes extended personal interviews with surviving members of Easy Company to give the viewer the opportunity to appreciate how character-defining and life-changing were the experiences these guys went through in WW2, and how superb was Spielberg's and Hanks' casting for the series in managing to get the actors exactly right. Some even look like the real men they portray (Frank John Hughes looks so like the real Bill Guarnere it's actually spooky, and all surviving members of Easy attest to the fact that British actor Damian Lewis's portrayal of Dick Winters captures the understated integrity, intelligence and leadership qualities of their real-life CO to perfection).There's little to say about this epic, landmark drama series that hasn't already been said. It's essentially a true story based on the real-life recollections of surviving members of Easy Company through their paratrooper-training in Georgia through 1942, to their deployment to England in 1943 in preparation for finally jumping into action with the 101st Airborne on the night of 5-6 June 1944 as part of the first wave of the allied invasion of Normandy, through their subsequent actions in France, Holland (Market Garden), holding Bastogne against the Waffen SS during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, to finally confronting the horrors of a Nazi death camp in Germany and occupying Hitler's Eagle's Nest retreat in the Alps in May 1945. The drama is gripping, the action sequences utterly realistic and viscerally real, the character portraits complex, the dialogue rich, clich&eacute;-free and tinged with irony and humor. Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and the entire Dreamworks production company excelled in every way with this series and produced a kind of masterpiece which it is difficult to imagine might ever be equalled. The seriousness of the subject matter is treated with respect, and every aspect of the writing, casting, direction (each episode has a different director but you'd hardly notice, so seamless is the production and the continuity) and editing is flawless.The Blu-Ray edition looks and sounds superb, and brings an even sharper realism to the original TV series. It's very nicely presented with the quality befitting this superlative piece of work. Since Spielberg proved with ""Schindler's List"" in 1993 that he could make grown-up films for a grown-up audience he has evolved into a serious, mature and intelligent film-maker of the highest calibre, and BOB may prove to be his crowning achievement in a lifetime of first-class work (though ""Pacific"" might run a very close second).BOB is not just first-class, genre-defining TV drama: it's also a fitting, respectful testimony to a generation not just of Americans but of all allied citizen-soldiers who fought and eventually won the greatest war in human history against a ruthless and totalitarian enemy who needed to be defeated: the most obvious and probably the only acknowledged ""just"" war of the past century, undiminished from the perspective of our more fortunate but generally less principled times where current issues of good and evil are far more opaque.Respect, Easy Company. Spielberg's epic may cause your names to live forever, as they should.PS 11 January 2011: just heard the news today that the real Dick Winters died on 2 January, aged 91. RIP."	5.0	Best Blu-Ray edition of the best-ever TV drama has everything befitting this greatest of true stories	2010-12-23	2	2	0

If you lived through one, you just got sent to the next battle.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2M597GCCE1N2S	"the one and only ""david"""	Band of Brothers is one of the best movies/series about WW2 that I personally feel is out in stores nowadays. Though the entire collection is some 90 bucks, keep in mind that this is definately worth it for just the battle scenes alone.Now I personally like to see the relationships between the soldiers rather than seeing guys getting shot or wounded in battle. It makes me miss the guys even more if they are shot because I sort of feel like they are someone I know who lives across the street from me or is my best friend.The main story focusses on men of Easy Company, who are paratroopers of the 101st airborne who fight in Germany during World War 2. While most of the disks are taken place during the war, I found myself liking the first and second disks the best, as the men trained for months before the war and then actually got to jump right before D-Day.David Schwimmer also makes an appearance as their drill sergant, who seemed to relish the fact that he could make their lives a living miserable hell if he really wanted to. One scene is that the cafeterias serve spaghetti one day, only to have a heavy duty run up several hills right after. A lot of guys lost their lunches in the following scenes.Anyway, each disk has their own storylines in them. From the first at bootcamp, to the sixth or seventh when they were entrenched in snow and forests outside several german occupied towns.Now some of the camera scenes may be a little hard to follow [the camera angles go up down, back and forth] but I soon got used to it and actually found it to add more to the suspense because the men were probably too distracted by the bombing to focus on the surrounding trees in detail.Now I really liked the acting, I thought the guys from New York were great, lots of talk about respect and earning it was in here, and i really respected what these guys did for each other, and for others. I really got to liking these guys more and more.All in all, this is probably the best story about bonding and wartime. The Men of Easy Company, in real life, even tell their experiences in war right before each episode starts, so it was cool to see them in real life.I would definately reccommend this, and if you don't have the money, well Christmas and Hanukah are in a few weeks, get my point?	5.0	They really hit the jackpot with this series.....	2004-10-23	8	6	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AJ65VI39IESY1	The one, the only, the immortal... JFP	"Band of Brothers follows the men of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne during World War Two. The series has ten episodes about 50 minutes to an hour long, and shows just how courageous people can be when they fight for what they believe in. This 7 disk set comes with a lot of graphic violence but is very accurate in portraying the lifestyles these men had to endure for many months, as well as the friendships they made in dangerous times.Episodes Include:1] Currahee - This takes place a year before D-Day and the men of Easy Company have arrived at boot camp. They must learn how to shoot a rifle, throw a grenade, learn sign language for stealth, and get into amazing physical shape from training as well as by running up a steep hill called Currahee. Led by their drill instructor Lt. Sobel [played by David Schwimmer] Easy Company starts to become the best at everything. The show ends after training as the men are called up to parachute into German occupied territory one day before D-Day to secure the area for the massive invasion.2] Day of Days- It's D-Day and Easy Company has parachuted into Normandy. Lt. Winters drops and finds he's lost his men, doesn't have a rifle, and after meeting with other men from different companies, realizes everyone has missed their dropzones. After meeting up at the area everyone is supposed to go to, Winters is given the mission to take out a German artillery position. A fierce firefight that is still studied today by soldiers in training happens as Winters and his men attack the German position. The first death of a man has Winters wondering if he will make it as well in the war.3] Carentan - The next job for Easy Company is to take control of a German occupied French town named Carentan. Although the mission goes surprisingly well, Winters is unsure it's over just yet. He's right, as a massive German counterattack force arrives to retake Carentan. What happens next is a stalemate between the two sides and another fierce firefight in the morning. However Easy Company prevails again with the help of a couple of tanks. The men take some well deserved R&R; but are then told they are going back to Normandy4] Replacements -  A new group of trainees, fresh out of bootcamp and never fired a rifle at a real person, arrive to replace those lost in the war so far. The next mission for Easy Company is called Operation Market Garden. Easy Company is ordered to take Eindhoven, a town in Holland. However the mission turns into a total failure as a massive German force turns the Allied forces back. Easy suffers many casualties and one man, Sgt. ""Bull"" Randleman, is stuck behind enemy lines.5] Crossroads - Winters is now a Captain after a fantastic victory against a German SS position which leaves two whole companies of SS dead. Winters prepares a report on the attack he led and the battle is shown through his eyes as he writes his report. Near the end of the episode Easy Company is told they need to go to the front line in the forested area near Bastogne.6] Bastogne - The 101st Airborne is surrounded by German forces and are holding the line during the Battle of the Bulge. 2 medics are the only source of relief for injured men and the story follows one of them, Eugene, as he struggles to deal with many men injured and sick. The famous response to a German demand for surrender is shown here, as the Comanding General of the Airborne responds, ""Nuts."" This is one of my favorite epsiodes just for the relationship between the medic, Eugene, and a nurse in the small town that holds the injured soldiers.7] The Breaking Point - In this episode Easy Company must take the town of Foy, in Belgium. However the incompetence of the company's leader, Lt. Dike, has many of the men wondering if the company is going  to suffer a lot of unnecessary casualties following him. Easy Company also suffers a month of constant shelling while sleeping in foxholes in the woods before the attack, and this epsiode shows just how demoralizing war could be. Easy Company takes the town, but not without heavy casualties. An emotional episode.8] The Last Patrol - Easy Company is on the front line in the town of Haguenau. A new mission is sent to Easy Company to cross the river that separates a German observation position from the Allied forces to capture German soldiers. Joining the patrol is Lt. Jones, a replacement fresh out of West Point who is eager to see some real action. This is another episode that shows the toll the war is taking on the men as the platoon the men are chosen from for this mission have already dwindled down in numbers from losses in Bastogne. Although the mission is a success, the death of a soldier has Winters wondering if orders for another patrol to be sent out the next day is a good idea.9] Why We Fight - More than 300,000 German troops have surrendered, and Easy Company finally drops into Germany. Rumors that the Germans are finished have reached the ears of the soldiers and they begin to predict when the war will end. However all that talk is pushed aside as a patrol discovers the Nazis' most disturbing secret, a concentration camp. This is another greatly emotional episode as the men are shocked at what brutality the camps show. Also, word of Hitler's suicide comes to Easy, and they are now sure victory in Europe is coming. The beginning and end for this episode are fantastic.10] Points - Germany has surrendered, and the men are wondering if they are going home. However in order to go home they need to have a certain number of, ""Points"" to show they've served their part in the war. They are also well aware that the war with Japan in the Pacific is still going on, and are wondering if they will be sent there next. This is the final episode of Band of Brothers, and it shows what the men are doing now that they are at peace with the Germans. At the end of the episode they show every single man who served in Easy Company and what they did after the war. A fantastic ending to a fantastic mini-series.Extras on Disk Seven:We Stand Alone, Together - A great documentary that shows the real men of Easy Company and what their lives were like during the war. A really great and emotional set of interviews.Ron Livingston's Video Diaries - Ron Livingston, the man who played Lt. Nixon, shows a set of clips he himself filmed during the, ""Actor Boot Camp,"" as the actors prepared to play the real men of Easy Company.The Making of Band of Brothers - A great look at the making of the mini-series. Showing the costumes, sets, and special effects.This is a great World War 2 experience. If you like watching World War 2 movies, this is one set that you should definately look at. Highly recommended."	5.0	This deserves so many more stars....	2006-07-26	5	4	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2P9KRC6DOFW0N	theSaw	"This series does a great job of telling the story of easy company, but it does have its flaws. The action sequences, reenactments, and special effects are top notch. There's a lot to enjoy here. The acting is very good as well. I would say that the quality is on the same level as Saving Private Ryan. I love the period and the costumes; they did a great job there.My biggest complaint with the series is the language. It seems the directors wanted to make the period palatable for ""modern"" audiences. It's over the top at times. Even the real Captain Winters commented on the language, I believe. Beyond the language is the overall Hollywood feel of the characters. Many of the soldiers just don't act like what I'd expect a 1940's soldier to act.One key point I keep disliking is when Capt. Winters shoots the young German SS soldier on the ""Island Charge."" What you see is a complete fabrication. That didn't happen. Winters in fact threw a grenade at the sentry, and the sentry threw a grenade back. Winter's grenade didn't go off, so he shot the German sentry, alerting the rest of the Germans to his presence.Another point where they missed it is in the ending, when the German officer offers Winters his pistol as a token of his surrender. In the series, Winters allows the officer to keep his sidearm. In reality, Winters accepted his sidearm.Why would the producers go through so much to keep the movie authentic and then totally goof at these points? Some would argue that these events happened at other points in the war. I would counter that while they may have happened in other parts of the war, they didn't happen in Easy Company, and fiction should not be passed off as truth. Just stick with the facts - is that too difficult?All considered, this is an excellent production, and there are some real gems to glean from this series. One thing that struck me is how much was sacrificed for our freedoms (especially in the Bastogne episode). Another nugget is the importance of effective leadership. Without a good leader, the team was unable to do what they needed to do. With a good leader, easy company was able to surmount overwhelming odds.All in all, Good."	4.0	Intense WWII Action and Excellent Stunts, but Hollywood Feel	2011-05-19	5	3	2

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1ZCX7B0LOD3CS	"Thomas A. Feehan ""tomsterusa"""	In my view, this is a miniseries that comes along once in a decade. Created by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, in my view it lives up to their reputations. Incredible cast led by Damian Lewis, its hard not to feel involved with the story. The movie includes interviews with some of the real soldiers depicted in the story which is a factual account (pretty much)of the battles covered. I strongly recommend this series.As an aside, Damian Lewis is in a new TV series called Life. Its about a police detective wrongly convicted of murder and vindicated after 12 years in jail. He receives a huge settlement for his wrongful imprisonment and goes back on the police force. Damian Lewis is terrific. Worth watching	5.0	Everyone should watch this series	2009-05-19	0	0	0

I consider this a glaring omission that does a great disservice to the men and women who actually served during this war. Many of them are 80+ years old, and hard of hearing.

It puts you in the action but gives a view of war, especially the sanitized WWII combat we've been exposed to over the years and shows that there is horror with the heroism, evil with the good and regular men trying to stay sane in an insane environment.  Yes, it's a war film but one unlike any done before or since.

This is definetely (in my opinion) one of the best series on war, it is emotional, disturbing, moving, and simply enthralling to watch, you will want to watch episode after episode.  The acting is superb, the story is beyond belief with such moving scenes and a tad of humor to join it all.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1O2Q3B4AUY558	Tim Ruzzo	Never has a movie shown both the tremendous action with the portrayal of human suffering before Band of Brothers. The action and special effects in Band of Brothers is the most tremendous showing of the emotion behind the battles. While watching some of the more emothional scenes I find myself taken aback at the amazing courage and firendship between the soldiers. When a member of the unit dies, you see the entire untis reaction and sadness. Incredibally none of the emotion takes away from the incredible action scenes. If you though Saving Porivate Ryan was a good WWII movie than Band of Brothers will blow you away. There is no way to explain how good this movie is. If you have any intrest in war, drama, or action, you will absolutly love Band of Brothers.	5.0	Exemplary	2004-06-08	7	4	3

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2LL1WTNPJV4TK	TJW	There is wonderful performances here--but we all need to shout loud until Amazon pays its fair share of corporation tax. I really enjoyed this author's earlier books and if you did, why don't you log in and leave 10 more reviews like this today. It shouldn't just be people who can't afford a team of tax specialists who pay their fair share of tax. Sign that cheque or forever lose my respect and the respect, no doubt, of the people who enjoy this series.Amazon was happy to take your money, but is trying every trick in the book to avoid paying its dues back. This has got to stop.Amazon avoids UK taxes by reporting European sales through a Luxembourg-based unit, which allows it to pay a rate of less than 12% on foreign profits last year--less than half the average corporate income tax rate in its major markets. The company's United Kingdom website reported a turnover of 207m for 2011, but its tax bill was just 1.8m.This is not illegal. It is immoral.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1AUYOLJHUBFY1	"TolkienFan ""Howard"""	I purchased this series as a gift for my adult son. He was enthralled by it when he first saw some of the exploits on HBO. He watched it and raved about it until I was finally allowed to &#34;borrow&#34; it and judge for myself. I will have to admit it is a spell-binding series to sit through. I have developed an affinity for &#34;action&#34; movies and &#34;war&#34; movies and this series does not disappoint. I thought &#34;Schindler's List&#34; was great in its time...and still think so. &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; was another favorite and I still believe it is one of the best war movies of all time. So, where does &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; fit into this heirarchy?? It is hard for me to say exactly. I have developed sort of a love/hate relationship with it. I use that term (love/hate..) to describe the emotional turmoil I feel, not my feelings toward the project!! In the first place, how do you compare a made for TV mini-series with a wide screen cinematic event? It is difficult at best because the portrayal of Easy Company takes place over ten to twelve hours allowing the viewer time to assimilate the story and to develop bonds with the characters that simply cannot take place in a two to three hour cinematic portrayal. For that reason I believe that &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; reaches into areas and touches virgin ground in its portrayal of the intricacies of war. Does that mean that a mini-series is a better venue than a feature film?? Not always, but maybe in this particular situation it is.So, if this project is so good, why only four stars..?? That's a good question and I am not certain that I can answer it. When you watch something this BIG, you expect BIG. You expect big plot lines and big characters. You expect big sets and big cinematography and big sequences. You expect big dialog and big action. And you expect your characters to display big emotion and demand a lot of empathy. And, for the most part, this series delivers all of that. I just wonder if it's really as good as I think it is.The main characters are well developed. I especially appreciate the efforts of Winston, Nixon, and Speirs. These characters lead the procession of Easy Company across France and Germany and along with many others form the nucleus around which the series revolves. There are many other characters who figure prominently in the series and are present in almost every episode. I haven't counted characters and episodes so I don't know for certain, but it seems like there are a lot of the same characters portrayed. This would make sense, both from a producer/director standpoint and from the standpoint of a real life military combat unit. Except in cases of extreme casualty losses, units tend to stay together and new or different faces are not too frequent. I think that the extended casting necessary for a project of this size is part of my reluctance to admit that this effort is in fact the &#34;best&#34; and worthy of that rating. I think it is impossible to fully develop all of those characters...yet I would like to see that happen. I don't know, it's probably just me!!In any event, this series, &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; is too well done and too grand to miss. As a war portrayal it covers events in a way never before seen and goes into detail never before attempted. I think it is important to remember the touchstone phrase &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; because we are dealing with a man-made portrayal of a particular series of events that actually happened. And while not one hundred percent accurate to recorded history, it is very close. And &#34;very close&#34; in this case means an ALMOST perfect portrayal. Don't miss this one!!	4.0	War--the worst subject at its very best....	2013-06-02	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2PAJMETC12UK1	Tomaso	I think the real reason is it reminded me of my father. My father fought in WWII, fought at Anzio and the North Africa campaign under Patton. Seriously wounded. My father didn't talk much about it, but he did say he didn't hate the German soldiers. He said they were just kids like him and his fellow soldiers. He hated Hitler and his crew, but not the German soldiers. And in Episode 9, the interviews with some Easy company vets - they felt the same way. One man said he could see fishing or hunting with them (under different circumstances). These men didn't see themselves as heroes, but they were.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A31EZZ14E0IIME	Tom Harrison	Band of Brothers is an emotional look at the World War 2 experiences of the men from E Company, 2nd Battalion 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. Over 10 episodes, the men grow from young recruits training in Toccoa, Georgia to soldiers on the frontline of some of the Allies' most crucial battles.The stories which unfold do not set out to make every man a hero who saved the world singlehandedly, but rather as human beings who came together as a group and battled against the odds. Each episode is seen through the eyes of a different soldier, everyone from Easy Company's unquestionable leader 'Dick' Winters to a field medic to a paratrooper separated from his battalion. The stories are touching and emotional but not to 'Hollywood' that they lose authenticity.The men upon which the show is based, the real veterans of E Company, provide interviews in the opening of each part of the series, giving insight into how the group really felt. Band of Brothers is not a show written by another big-shot whose closest encounter with war is through the nightly news.One cannot recommend this series enough. To watch it is to pay homage to those young men who created the freedom we have today, to respect and be grateful for what they did.For those who appreciate that war is not all guts and glory, or who respect what the men of the WW2 generation did, Band of Brothers is a brilliantly written and produced series worthy of 5-star status.The DVD boxset is brilliant, with documentaries and interviews to complement a perfect audio-visual transfer. It is complete with both Dolby Digital and DTS soundtracks, is presented in 16x9 widescreen format, and includes subtitles in nearly every language imaginable. As any DVD buff will tell you, Band of Brothers sets the standard for TV on DVD.	5.0	The generation of heroes...	2004-01-09	4	3	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AB6Y0GF6BYK8N	TomJ	The first time I watched this on t.v., I was simply blown away by the production and amount of time put into this mini series. From the acting, to the attention to detail of the tanks and weapons used by both the Axis and Allied armies. By watching this I have much more understanding of what the soldiers went through. From Normandy to Bastogne. When blu ray first came out I looked through everything that would look very good in stunning high definition. Considering that high definition didn't really come out until after the release of this series, I was skeptical as to how they would make this series pop in high definition. I was blown away by how they did it. This product is by far the best blu ray product I have with The Pacific coming in second. These two series are the defining point of cinematography as well as production value. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is willing to take the time. Not only the high definition part, but also the deep and emotional impact that the series provides the viewer.	5.0	Such a well done mini series. Speechless is what it has made me.	2011-12-12	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1NKK7AOQGEXK2	Tony Hsieh	I read a lot of other reviews that claimed that this title looks no different than the DVD.  I will say this; as far as reference quality material goes, this isn't one of them.  This isn't Avatar; it's not meant to look like crisp, clean, pristine CGI animation.  If you want to show off the merits of Blu Ray, then this probably won't wow anyone who is unfamiliar with the format.With that being said, BoB is still one of the best looking Blu Ray releases out there.  What makes it great is it's sharpness and clarity in spite of the grain heavy look of the series, which is intentional.  I'm glad the producers did not go back and go crazy with DNR.  Despite the grain in certain scenes, the clarity is astounding.  Uniform patches and stiching pop with sharpness.  Many of the outdoor scenes are like you are standing there yourself.  The foliage, mud, stones, brick, buildings, etc. are absolutely stunning to watch on a large TV.My only complain is that there are certain scenes in the Bastonge episodes that looked a little, murky.  Edges were muddy on some faces, and the blinding white snow did not pop off the screen like I was expecting.  I was looking forward to these scenes in 1080p more than anything else in the series, but they weren't as stunning as some others.All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is a fan of war movies.  Just don't expect it to be reference quality material in terms of sharpness and clarity, but know that this is as awesome as Band of Brothers will ever look.	5.0	Awesome Blu Ray!!	2010-07-19	2	2	0

The actors are well chosen (with the exception of David Schwimmer) especially Frank who plays Bill Guarnere, his accent and looks are spot on to Wild Bill! and Dale Dye as the battalion commander.The documentary is worth watching alone.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3S6S57EXHVJB1	"truth ""nefarious incognito"""	I see that 551 reviews go before mine and that Band of Brothers is unanimously given 5 stars.  What else do you need to know?Band of Brothers is the story of a company of American paratroopers [Easy Company] from training, through D-Day and allied fighting in Western Europe until the end of the war.  The characters and events are so memorable and compelling that I can see and feel them freshly in my mind although I haven't watched the series in some time now.  One of the things I like about this series is that it takes its time.  I was in the Army myself [noncombat] and feel that Band of Brothers captures each step of the progression towards company unity and the selflessness that I am most proud of possessing as a lingering positive from my time in the military.  I'm sure that real combat veterans would be disturbed by the series play towards romanticism.  While events and characters appear very realistically portrayed, the series does also represent the &quot;nobler&quot; aspects of war, such as sacrifice, camaraderie, and leadership.  We've all heard how real combat veterans generally (and naturally) refrain from talking about the horrors of war.  While I enjoy watching war-based and military documentaries, I'm sure those actual veterans might find such romanticism disturbing and perhaps hateful.  Even with that in mind, this series is simply outstanding cinematically and, most importantly, dramatically.  Perhaps in an attempt to bring the reality of war home closer to us, many episodes of the series open with first-person accounts from the actual men of Easy Company who fought in the war and remain with us today.  This shows a respect for what appears to be the way veterans view war and makes the viewer feel the suffering of the characters more.  It heightens the series' realism greatly and the special disk devoted exclusively to interviews with Easy Company veterans is worth the investment in the series by itself.  Do yourself a favor and own one of the finest things television has ever created.David Schwimmer -- who knew?	5.0	An outstanding series	2003-09-19	2	1	1
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1SUSJCVSRLWUH	"T. Salvitti ""tommytechie"""	"Where do I begin? This series from beginning to end just floored me. Was it because I've always been extremely interested in history (particularly WWII)? Was it because my grandfather (god rest his soul) was real life friends with one of the actual ""main"" men of Easy Company portrayed in this film? Was it the great acting, high production values and attention to detail?Yes.This is one of those war films that draw you completely into it - you feel yourself get involved with Easy Company. When an episode is over, I felt myself thinking about what that must of been like in real life as the credits roll. I'll tell you right now, speaking as someone who has seen many war films including ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Guns of Navarone"", ""Bridge over the River Quai"" (my spelling could be off) and many many more -- the accuracy of this film is easily verified with a little research to your nearest library.Btw, this is probably the first time in about 4 years and 30 or 40 ""movie"" reviews that I actually gave a 5 star rating.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A30LL2KC7SKNVB	T. Stewart	"This is a great series.  The cast selection was superb.  In telling the story of the main characters, the producers spared no expense.  All of the actors were put through a mini-boot camp and were instructed to remain in character for the duration of the filming.  The end result is that they are believable in every way.  They easily become US military personnel of the era.  Each of the actors adopts the persona of their real-life counterpart and become that person.  By remaining in character, they effortlessly respond to their name and convey the feeling that they are actually who they portray.  I read the book and much of the dialogue stems from the book.  One can connect to each of the main characters.  It was interesting to note that many of the actors are British, but pull off an American accent very nicely.All of the battle scenes are meticulously researched and draw the viewer in.  In particular, the scenes set during the siege of Bastogne where the men are holding the line in the Ardennes forest. They are so realistic that I could feel the cold and experience the privations the men were experiencing, although many of the scenes were shot on a sound stage.  My favorite battle scenes however, were of the D-Day landings and the attack on the German Artillery Battery at Brecourt Manor.  I was privileged to travel to Normandy a few years ago and went to Brecourt Manor and the story was retold by the current resident who is the son of the actual family who lived there at the time.  There is a small monument dedicated to the members of Easy Company who attacked the manor and destroyed the guns that were firing on Utah Beach.As I watched the series, I became more acquainted with each of the characters and was saddened each time one was killed in battle or because of some weird accident.  You cannot help but notice that each of the actual members of the 501st ""Easy Company"" were proud to have served and while it was a terrifying experience for many, to a man, they would not have missed it for anything.  They fought for each other and bonded as brothers.  I felt the loss of their comrades as conveyed by each of the actual members in their interviews for the series.  I think this series does a great honor to the men of the 101st Airborne and all of the soldiers who fought during WWII.  I have the series on DVD and much of the background of the making of the series is in the ""special features"" section of each disk."	5.0	A real honor to the 101st Airborne	2014-07-12	0	0	0

The seres takes you through Easy Company(E) Airborne division's boot camp/paratrooper school and wartime missions and exploits. The series is accurate, dramatic, and it uses the actual soldiers to help narrate the events their squad experience through interviews. There is an amazing cast, including Damien Winters who helps lead a well cast &#34;band of actors&#34;. I have watched this series countless times, It is rich in detail and scenery; I feel like I pick a new nuance each time I watch. Psychologically compelling, and at times emotionally devastating or up lifting. This is one of the great WWII epic series available on the subject.	5.0	So good you will watch it more than once	2014-06-18	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2SVBQ11Z9SUGD	tv is my friend	To begin with, I'm not much of a fan of war movies. But my son is interested in WW2 in a big way so I rented BOB to watch over the weekend. And I was stunned. The acting was amazing, the effects, the scenery, but above all, the story of these brave paratroopers blew me away. I can't recommend this highly enough. You don't have to be a fan of historical or war movies. If you're a fan of courage, of bravery, of men who lived through something I can barely comprehend, you should watch this miniseries.  I'll be buying it so I can watch it again and again.	5.0	simply amazing	2009-09-28	0	0	0
B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1TTFG5N0D5N3U	tvviewer	This is another great film about those special men who volunteered to leap into history, and it's not a fictional story. Interviews with living members bring authenticity to an exciting World War 2 series. It was brutal becoming a paratrooper, and challenging to apply their training in combat. They were warriors all the way from leaping into France on D-Day to Germany's final surrender. The group who brought you &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; serve up another outstanding production, capturing what combat really looks like. &#34;Band Of Brothers&#34; is well worth the time invested in watching it.	5.0	Elite Paratroopers Storm Europe	2014-06-16	0	0	0

There was no reason that this couldn't be cut down to a shorter film, except that the producers were trying to dig a bit too deeply.

I have now watched it 5 times and it is great every time.  This shows what it means to fight for something and the hardships and losses that creates as well as the bonds that are forged.  I believe that this should be required viewing in all schools and also should be required for anyone wanting to come here on a Visa or to try to gain Citizenship, I think that this represents what it means to be an American and as such is a good way to show that to others.	5.0	Best Mini series ever	2014-06-03	1	1	0

Educators can take full advantage of the series as a valuable teaching aid, as the series was researched extensively for historical accuracy.

The fact that some people are just not cut out for the army (officers included) is not shied away from.  It is a series about courage, honor, bravery, resilience, and brotherhood.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1QMIDCXHND9A0	vikes fan	My neighbor has this movie set, and let me borrow it for a while to watch.  I have to say, I have seen a number of movies, documentaries, and depictions of World War 2 and Band of Brothers is hands down the best I have ever seen.  The acting in this movie is outstanding, and many of the scenes seem so real that at times you forget you are watching a movie.  We have all seen movies that have a cast which is largely unknown and lacks star power, yet delivers.  This movie exactly fits that type of film.  One of the reasons why this movie is called Band of Brothers is because of the comradory that develops between the men of easy company.  The men who play the soldiers of easy company do a great job of showing how such a strong bond can develop in a time where the only thing to lean on are the men next to you.  One of the most powerful aspects of this movie is how well it portrays the harsh realities of war.  The violence, hardships, and even celebratory times are all included in this movie in a very realistic way.  The Bottom line is, this movie, although not live footage, gives viewers the most unique inside look at war to date.	5.0	Awesome series	2012-09-28	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	I like the way different directors and writers handle each episode - usually from the perspective of a different one of the men of Easy Company. For example, one episode set in Bastogne is done from the perspective of a medic. Another episode, after that, is from the perspective of Webster, who missed Bastogne because he was in the hospital. The other men resented his not having shared in their misery during those cold winter months in the trenches, being blown to bits. But he shows himself worthy on &#34;The Last Patrol.&#34;It's a great series. The only feature film that I think comes close to the grit and realism of Band Of Brothers is Battleground, from 1949. It, too, is shown from the perspective of the average soldier, not the leaders. That's what makes this series so unique - most war films are written from the perspective of the leadership or the historian because they're based on the memoirs of various military leaders. Most people want to know what it was like for the average Joe.Also, the production values are through the roof. This is probably one of the best mini-series ever made. It will definitely live on as a classic.	5.0	Brilliant	2013-06-07	1	1	0

I watched it twice in the past monthFirst of all it is still MUST SEE! It IS engaging and worthwhile, but Spielberg et al fail miserably at bring it to life as it could be.The story of Winters is the center piece but other characters are hard to follow and short changed. Spliced in here and there despite importance. Nixon and Winters have a relationship (no not that kind!) but for the life of me I can't figure out what Nix actually does.Guess who ran Easy Company the longest?The most compelling character to me was Webster. Evidently from a well-to-do family and could have been a commissioned officer but chose to be on the front line, a grunt. He refused every promotion and came out a private. How does Spielberg miss this?! There are so many repeated details; we get it, Spiers is into hoarding loot...Nixon has problems with the bottle. These aspects are repeated often to no good effect. Show bogs down as the war does...we did not need the last 2 hours to be so slow paced.Maps...I need Maps!! How difficult of film craft is it to have graphics. Where the heck is Bastogne? I know where it is but had to consult a map during the show""The President died""....""Hitler died""... Just kinda small events that don't play too much into the whole story...Looks like they run over budget by the time the concentration camp scene comes around. I understand they spent millions on the snow....We don't get a sense of the times. At one point current events mentions Abbot and Costello etc... that's about it. It's as if in a vacuum. Remember the movie M*A*S*H how Altman used the music and Korean songs to set the mood? This one has a dramatic sound track instead.Spielberg has made a career out of being a competent director who can spot a good story and give it an average reading with few surprises. He rarely fumbles nor does he make the big score. He plays it safe.But please do watch it! The story gets 5 stars and you'll enjoy most of it but I just keep thunking of all the missed opportunities.Man, that Easy Company story needs to be told nowadays more than ever!Please keep Spielberg and Hanks away from iconic material from now on."	3.0	A Must See ...But...	2014-02-17	9	1	8

I got it for the rock-bottom price of $35, which I would have paid more. Unfortunately, with the economy the way it is, I had to keep it cheap. I was lucky enough to be able to buy a new computer with a 21"" LCD screen that was Blu-Ray capable, so that is my only limitation to watching this.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A39FUKZAYHJR8I	Weston S. McKane	I'm cheating! I did buy and view the Private Ryan extravaganza, but Band of Brothers is a little too pricey for this Social Security person.However, I did serve with G Company of the 7th Infantry from March of '44 to March of '45, mostly as a weapons platoon leader, so I know of which I speak!!Pyle never got past Battaliobn HQ and Ambrose could have written his stuff without leaving the states (I've read both authors).Hollywood shows lots of grimy, unshaven characters, almost totally unrealistic sound effects, bizarre examples of marksmanship and - of course lots of blood (see the opening of Private Ryan).(Aside - the 3rd Div. participated in some 6 seaborne invasions, none so incompetently managed as the landing at Omaha Beach. It should be further noted that the Airborne probably suffered their highest casualties from the US Navy and bad piloting by the US Air Corps - something currnetly referred to as &quot;friendly fire&quot;!!)Surprising as it may seem, we shaved and washed regularly and had reasonably regular meals (keeping in mind that the 3rd was a regular army division with lots of experience and contacts!!)To borrow a Marine saying from Tony Zinni,  the 3rd Division in WW II was tops in its field in &quot;Killing People and Breaking Things&quot;.  Probably a few English, German and Russian divisions did as well - but certainly no American - they lacked the experience.I lasted from Anzio to just inside Germany (with one remand to a rest camp).  In Germany, I, along with the remainder of the 2d Bn. were captured and spent several weeks ( mostly walking - nothing new! to the environs of Stuttgart.As a last note, despite Ambrose's protestations (after all, he wsn't there!!), the first Americans into Berchtesgaden were elements of the 3rd Bn, 7th Infantry - some ten hours sooner(!!!)than a bunch of bedraggled paratroopersWes McKane,  Wpns Pl, G Co., 7th Inf., 3rd Div.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2EUN25B63U0IP	William Boswell	I saw The Pacific first and didn't think it could be beaten.  I don't know how I missed this one when it first came out.  I'd heard of it, but never saw it.  I have to admit that this is truly one amazing series.  While I still like The Pacific, I finished watching this one in less time because I was so captivated with the story.  I also liked the interviews with the real soldiers at the beginning and on the extras DVD.  I'm glad those interviews and the reunion were recorded while they were still alive.This series and The Pacific really show the truth behind WWII and what those men had to endure.  I was especially enamored with the episode about the medic because I was an army medic years ago.  It was very easy to sympathize with him since I know many medics during war time (then and now) are targeted.My DVD's arrived two days past the estimated arrival date, but I can't complain since it was Christmas week.  All DVDs were in great condition and none missing as I've seen reported.  I was surprised the series was not shot in widescreen, but that didn't deter from the quality of the program.I highly recommend this series as well as The Pacific, but I think I'm leaning more toward Band of Brothers as my new favorite between the two.  I'm glad I have both and hope to see more.  This series could have cost twice what I paid for it and it would still be worth it.	5.0	Amazing Series	2011-12-27	3	2	1

You feel like you are part of the Company, and have a better-than-front-row-seat to the highs and lows the men experience together. After watching just a few episodes you can easily see how men thrown together in a situation like this would develop life-long commitments to each other.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A1VSL94LAC0IM4	William Varney	The soldiers who fought in World War Two are often referred to as &#34;The Greatest Generation&#34; and upon watching this series you can see why. It is an accurate portrayal of a part of the U.S. Army 101st Airborne &#34;Easy&#34; Company and follows them from basic training until the end of the war. The characters are engaging, well-rounded and interesting and the series episodes all begin with little short clips of anecdotes of some of the living survivors. I particularly was fully engaged by the series due to the fact that my father fought in the same war, in many of the same battles, only he was in a different division and was regular infantry, not airborne. He died when I was 13 so I never really got to talk with him about what he went through during the war, although I did know that he had always been proud to serve, and received the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, Unit Citations, and various campaign medals. Band of Brothers is worth watching by anyone, but especially if you had a father or grandfather or relative who had served. The vividly shot cinematography combined with historically correct uniforms, sets and supplies draw the viewer in to the point where you nearly feel like you are a part of &#34;Easy&#34; Company. It does contain some graphic violence due to the fact that it is about war and battle so parents should take note of the age appropriate rating, however if your children are old enough to watch and you want them to actually learn real history while also being entertained while watching TV so they they don't grow up as self-absorbed and clueless, Then I fully recommend &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; with a full Five stars.	5.0	Action, Humanity, History, World War Two	2014-06-21	0	0	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2ZHSORK1HHYTT	Willy D. Reviewer	This is worth owning.Although they took meticulous time getting the dates, characters, and places correct, they did not portray the soldiers realistically.  That is, never -- and I repeat, never -- would a squad of soldiers bunch together and walk across an open field in enemy territory.  One grenade or mortar shell and they are all dead.  Also, when advancing into enemy territory, you shut up -- you do not reveal your position.When walking through a forest, a soldier is trained to walk from tree to tree.  If the enemy open fire you are not caught walking between the trees, you can quickly advance to the tree in front of you for cover.  And you shut up coming through the woods.There are many other irregularities -- especially walking with your weapon pointed at the guy to your left! -- that I won't list them all.But the DVD set is worth watching and owning, even if they didn't have a military technical adviser on the set.	5.0	Excellent Historical Narrative	2014-04-25	1	1	0

I could list scene after scene of masterful directing and acting. But here, I will revel in its themes and people, in its aspirations and history.Here are the men of Easy Company, 506th PIR, World War II. The characters are real persons in history; don't forget that. It what makes the series so special. They are real, this did happen. This is not just another war movie. Indeed, can it be called so generally a ""war movie""? It defies such genre terms. This has such depth, such meaning. There is no music in the action scenes. No; such horrors are not something to from which to elicit orchestrated excitement. This is war, life and death. This is serious.Here is the brotherhood, the trauma, the delight, the pain of a select few of soldiers, a tried and true ""band of brothers."" Nothing is held back. We see death and feel injustice. We are given the bare, unedited facts of cruelty and sorrow in the war. Yet we are also shown strength and honor, camaraderie and leadership, a certain beauty inherent in that same action. We see life's two sides and realize the terror was, yes, somehow worth it in the end.There are many themes; each show explores a different moving motion. There is quality beyond description. I can't even imagine that these are actors. No; these are such real people, down to the dirt on their fingernails and the quiet, fearful honesty that is portrayed on some level by each.I owe a great debt to this series. Its careful adherence to historical accuracy has broadened my knowledge immensely. Its beautiful rendition of character and orchestration has elevated my soul to heights of inspiration and delight. It has introduced me to people I will never forget. It has shown me reality; it has shown me beauty. I have been immersed in an experience worth knowing, in character worth emulating, and I will treasure the time I have spent in its presence."	5.0	Beautiful....	2011-12-23	2	1	1

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A3V5VUIQZUJDDH	YP	"I rarely review things on Amazon, but Band of Brothers was so excellent, I just had to put in my two cents.  So many war epics go for either the ""realism"" route (i.e. violent battles) or what I call the ""philosophical"" route, essentially making it seem as though war is a classroom where soldiers debate the pros and cons of what they are doing.  But Band of Brothers doesn't fall into either of those traps.Essentially, by the end, you will feel like a member of Easy Company.  You'll understand them as people, share in their fears and their hopes for what the end of the war can be, and have the utmost respect for the sacrifices they made.  You'll laugh at the occasional shenanigans they pull to keep themselves sane, while you'll also feel the incredible sorrow when one of their brethren falls.Band of Brothers might be the best piece of work ever committed to film.  I realize that is an incredibly bold statement, but it will be well worth your time to see if you agree.  Every moment of this miniseries is incredibly well done--including the opening credits, which I was happy to sit through before each episode.I highly recommend the Blu-ray version.

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"Right off the bat, I just want to comment that Band of Brothers is the best dramatic interpretation of World War II events that I have ever seen (think ""Saving Private Ryan"", but for ten entire episodes).  The basic premise of the show is following the 101st Airborne Regiment (a section of the 506th Parachute Regiment) from its entrance into the war (""basic"" training) to events such as D-Day, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and eventually capturing Hitler's famed ""Eagle's Nest"" hideout and symbolically ending the European campaign.  There are two main reasons why I believe this cinematic masterpiece is the best of all-time:First, is the realism of the war-action scenes.  Whether it was the visual spectacle of hundreds of paratroopers floating down into France on D-Day, the intense street-to-street fighting that was often needed to capture certain landmarks, or the trees exploding from German shells in the woods nearby Bastogne as American soldiers dived for cover, the sheer scope of the cinematography is remarkable and will leave you feeling as if you have the slightest comprehension of what being there ""in the flesh"" must have been like.  I remember when ""Saving Private Ryan"" was released and many film-goers commented on how realistic the D-Day action was...well, Band of Brothers sustains that realism throughout multiple war events.  A sight to behold, at the very least.However, what really makes Band of Brothers special is its dramatic focus on the men of Easy Company (the 101st).  The show starts right from the beginning, with the men receiving the toughest training the army has to offer.  Grueling runs up and down the infamous ""Curahee"" mountain effectively weeded out the best of the best and essentially shaped Easy Co. into perhaps the finest fighting force in the entire U.S. Service.  The bond that those men achieved during that training carries over into their combat experience (starting with their drop behind enemy lines on D-Day), and makes for a very personal dramatic experience, as each man really did think of the guy next to him as a brother of sorts.  What really impressed me, though, was how each episode seemed to focus on a different dramatic angle to the story.  A few that stand out in my mind are...-How Easy Co. handles the incompetence (leading to lives being needlessly lost in one case) of not one but two different commanders throughout the war.-The internal struggle of Frank Winters, who initially leads Easy Co. but eventually moves up in rank.  Though he is honored by the promotion, he also is a bit uncomfortable in what he perceives as ""leaving"" his men in the heat of war.-The devastation that was wreaked in the forests surrounding Bastogne, where more American soldiers (without proper winter clothing) died because of sickness and ""trenchfoot"" (essentially a completely frozen foot) than due to enemy shelling.  Perhaps the saddest moment of the series comes when one Lt. sees his two best friends get their legs blown off trying to help others find cover.  The Lt. suffers a nervous breakdown and is never quite the same afterwards.-The level of shock in the hearts and minds of Easy Co. when they stumble across their first concentration camp and liberate it.Overall, Band of Brothers will both shock you with the intensity of its war scenes and make you think long and hard about the heavy toll that warfare takes on the human soul.  A special treat comes at the tail end of the series, when actually living veterans of Easy Co. appear on camera and tell their experiences firsthand.For anyone even remotely interested in war drama, this series will blow you away.  Also, if I were an instructor teaching the effects of WWII, I can guarantee that I would use multiple clips from this series."	5.0	A Cinematic and Dramatic Experience You Will Never Forget	2008-12-05	1	1	0

B00006C7G9	Band of Brothers [VHS]	A2N83J84NW8RYG	Zach	There are plenty of reviews on here explaining why this series is amazing. And there is good reason, too.What stands out about &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; is its commitment to detail and its unique perspective on war. You follow E-Company from their first drop on D-Day, to the wars end. The series does a remarkable job of showing the humanity of the soldiers, on both sides. In a way that I personally haven't seen before. You are brought into the fold and witness how these particular men form friendships and trust. To give and earn respect from fellow soldiers and officers. It has a documentary feel that delves into individual lives more than any movie can really accomplish.The negative reviews I see point out historical inaccuracies, and generally have a negative view of military and war itself. Though, to be honest, who enjoys war? Remember that this is only entertainment. Hollywood will always embellish some details and completely change others to make what your watching more interesting. And with little knowledge of the actual history of E-Company, i wont claim to believe they were perfectly, or even kind of accurate in their re-telling of history.But in the end, &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; delivers an intense, dramatic and enthralling perspective of the men fighting on the front lines of war. Baring their humanity, uncertainty, pride, morality and countless other strong adjectives i wont waste your time with. As long as you view it as entertainment with historical embellishments and not a definition of historical events, you will come away happy enough, or at the very least entertained.Happy watching!

The soldiers have arrived in France on D-Day, they capture an enemy soldier, who turns out to be...  from Portland, Oregon (""My family's Austrian, and we answered the call of the Motherland"").  That scene really drove home to me the impossible and crazy situation that those men were put in.  Excellent drama, great special effects, good acting.
