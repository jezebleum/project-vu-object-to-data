(hold down command+option+i when loading the disk!). The options in this DVD make it something more than just  another movie playing from a disk; it's a multimedia experience.

0790745399	The Matrix	A7TFB5T1RUBYS	808guy	I purchased this blu-ray to upgrade from my DVD. The Picture transfer is great,BUT the audio was a poor excuse for a Blu-ray. This is the worst blu-ray i have come across since the first release of Terminator 2 on blu-ray. If you want T2 on blu-ray the skynet edition is an excellent upgrade!! Warner Bros. needs to do the same and upgrade the audio to a 6.1 DTS for one of the best action movies of all time to truely experience the dynamic sound that The Matrix should be watched with. Until then dont waste your money on this Blu-ray if you own the DVD.	2.0	The Matrix(Blu-ray)	2012-07-27	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A3JRAKUG0TB81C	"A. Bagchee ""Tech Snob"""	"I guess my biggest complaint with Matrix is that inspite of a big budget and veteran action producer Joel Silver, the Wachowski brother played it too safe. Maybe they were afraid of isolating the mainstream viewer if the storyline was too radical. I personally feel that they could have been bolder and done decent business.Matrix is a awe inspiring cyber-adventure, full of kinetic excitement, and borrows the gravity-defying choreography reminiscent of John Woo movies, but the ending could be considering anti-climactic by some. It's kind of a letdown when a movie begins by redefining the nature of reality, and ends with a shoot-out. Movie-goers want a leap of the imagination, not one of those obligatory climaxes.It's great-looking, both in its design and in the kinetic energy that powers it. One of the main advantages of getting the DVD is to watch John Gaeta work his magic! He used flawlessly integrated special effects and animation to visualize regions of cyberspace. It creates fearsome creatures, including mechanical octopi. It morphs bodies with the abandon of ""Terminator II."" It uses f/x to allow Neo and Trinity to run horizontally on walls, and hang in the air long enough to deliver karate kicks. It has leaps through space, thrilling sequences involving fights on rooftops, helicopter rescues and battles over mind control. If my memory serves me right, Gaeta is the first one to film special effects sequences with 30+ camera simultaneously shooting at 12000 frames per second!And it has performances that find the right notes. Keanu Reeves goes for the impassive Harrison Ford approach, ""acting"" as little as possible. Laurence Fishburne finds a balance between action hero and Zen master. Carrie-Anne Moss, as Trinity, has a sensational title sequence, before the movie recalls that she's a woman and shuttles her into support mode. Hugo Weaving, as the chief Agent, uses a flat, menacing tone that almost sounded like he is straining to find an American accent :)This is strictly a personal choice but there could have been action sequences balanced with an audacious conclusion, to arrive at revelation, not just victory. I wanted an ending that was transformational, like ""Dark City's,"" and not one that simply throws us a sensational action sequence. There is still hope though with the sequels currently in production (Part 2) and shooting (Part 3) stages."	5.0	Very interesting storyline with stunning effects.	2000-08-18	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A32JKNQ6BABMQ2	"abe ""starman"""	this movie set the standard not only in special effects but set the standard in sci fi films.only a few times in history has a sci fi film come along that was so far ahead it made all others before it obselete.first there was 2001:a space odyssey,then in the late 70s there was the star wars set,and again in the 80s and 90s with the terminater series.now the standard setter is the matrix!its a bit scientific in places but awesome through and through.theres a world made by computers.only a few master hackers are hip to this and aim to break free.in it is the crippled dude from oz.the black dude from the star wars jedi counsel and ted from bill and teds excellent adventure.the kids wil lkke it.it looks really expensive!its the second best of the set id say.the third one was excellent but nearly  as good as the 1st 2.sci fans and action fans will be most drawn to it  but its really likeable by all.theres one chick but shes all dykey loooking.the bad guy is very obnoxious.the important message is dont trust computers.this is way better than bill and ted and speed and just a little bit better than the episode1 and 2 the black dude was in.the special effects are really the story here.in this world,anything is possible,so these guys learned to fight really good.they can watch bullets fly past in slow mo,fly,make impossible jumps and do things that would make a kung fu master scratch his head.the effects are the best ever and have been emulated by movie after movie,video games, commercials and all else.the effects are phenominal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!there were 3 parts.are all released.no more are coming.both of the first 2 matrix movies scored very big at the box office.a must see.	5.0	2nd best sci fi flick ever	2004-10-01	0	0	0

Lawrence Fishbourn was so awesome in this movie. The cast was great the action was great and the  special effects were great! The only thing on the downside is this movie  dragged a little to much but carried a great plot so it wouldn't seem  boring. Hard to understand but you'll get used to it.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2ZBF3W2TWH2M8	A Customer	If you didn't like the 13th Floor, don't assume you won't like the Matrix.  The Matrix is fast-paced, original, and wonderfully crafted (e.g., did you know that the red hues were filtered out of the matrix scenes to give the  viewer a sense of a drab facsimile of reality?).  Although few sci-fi  movies are as thought-driven as 2001, the Matrix is surprisingly  stimulating.  It definitely holds your attention throughout and makes you  want to watch it again when you're done!	5.0	Guns and glory!	1999-12-10	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A3FUM4NITEO72A	A Customer	But the broad with the short dark hair isn't at all ugly, either...I managed to not see this during however many months it was in the theatres, but I finally broke down and bought the DVD during a recent spending spree that would have made even House Democrats cringe.  This is one helluva movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.  Action sequences are cool, fighting is top-notch, and Keanu wasn't asked to perform beyond his abilities, which made him much more believable.  Probably too violent for the kids, but there is no direct sexual content that I recall.

I am in my forties, a woman, and I still loved it.  The story line  helps you overlook the flaws in some of the &quot;logic,&quot; but the  special effects are superb.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1WT8IK8L6GYQJ	Adam A. Zurek  III	Matrix is the best movie I have seen in a long time.  My friends kept telling me to see it over and over again for about a year.  I thought that I wouldn't like it because Keanu Reeves is in it.  I finally saw it about  two months ago and I have seen it four times since then.  This movie made  me think about reality as I know it a lot.  The concept of the plot is  amazing.  It is so original, atleast I never heard of anything like it  before.  The action is ofcourse awesome too.  The special effects are  wonderful.  The soundtrack is awesome too.  I have had that before I owned  the movie.  I love Rammstein and Marilyn Manson and the techno music too.  Massive Attack has a song in the movie that was not on the soundtrack.  I  wish their song would've been on there.  So what I'm saying is see this  movie and own the soundtrack.	5.0	Awesome Movie	2000-06-01	2	1	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A10AAKKOL2WXEV	Adam Clark	"The producer, writer or directors may not be fully aware of what they have done but they have created a ground breaking film of biblical significance. The film has many comparisons to the New Testament with Neo, Morpheus and Cypher playing the parts of Jesus, John the Baptist and Judas respectively.However even more interestingly is that we can now experience the Matrix for ourselves. Recently a new spiritual force has been spreading throughout the world opening up the possibility of experiencing this insight.The biggest difference to the film is that outside our Matrix lies paradise rather than the dark world portrayed in the film. In fact we are all in a perpetual living hell, it is up to each individual to learn how to escape it.So the question is ""Do you want to take the red pill or the blue pill?"".If you want to see something that will really bake your noodle then go to enlightenment.atspace.com.

0790745399	The Matrix	A96GQNMC7BPC3	"A. Doug Floyd ""pilgrim"""	I don't usually watch a film more than once. Most films simply cannot hold my attention for a second, third or fourth viewing. The Matrix is different. I have yet to tire of it. It's a good story, the visuals are impressive, and the special effects are simply amazing. It is a bit violent and those who don't enjoy violent films should avoid it. But I think it will go down as one of those timely films that captured a snapshot of our cultures myths at a certain point in time.	5.0	Worth watching several times.	2001-07-29	1	0	1
0790745399	The Matrix	AMP7TQRWAIE84	"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D"""	It's true. The series steadily goes downhill with each additional release.When The Matrix made its debut, it was all the rage. And rightfully so!It was revolutionary, it was fresh and most importantly, it was cool!The special effects were usually top-notch and the characters were good, displaying decent acting. My favorite character was played by Laurence Fishburne, aka Morpheus (sp?). He was strong, and strongly desired by the opposing forces.The action was good, but the effects, especially the slow-motion, dodging ones, were off the hook.It was good, but the steam simmered as the series went on.4 stars.	4.0	The only one worth watching.	2007-10-22	1	1	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A3ONKRWEZMJJUV	"Adrian Duran Sanchez ""Conductista"""	Deep, the rabbit hole takes you away from the computer-generated dream world to the horrifying real Catharsis where Machines are all dominant and aggressive against the all too organic humans, now secondary in the alimentary chain. You'll wet your pants at first sight with the Power Plant. Alas, this is the real thing, you are a Battery. Now a Myth in movie history, The Matrix is Anime style for real, or at least, close enough to the concept. Released in 1999, this little project (as little as 75 million dollars) came from nowhere to be the new philosophy in this modern science fiction / action adventure film era. Conceptually ground breaking, and visually stunning, the film blends Kun Fu (Mega Kick action), along with the appealing Cyber-Punk way of adventure, to bring something never seen before, not here, neither in Indochina. The new photograph technique Bullet-Time, showed the world how things look as clearly as possible in a 360 degrees-CGI environment, with a highly fashioned hero skipping bullets (not fast enough for Neo), and immediately, every one of us went to say, Woooooowwwww man. Quickly the film became an instant box-office success, carving in the cultural collective conscience of the so called: computer / comic geeks (from here on, its actually cool to be one, no more shame), and the rest of the normal people (the ones who actually get laid). And so, the critics and audiences all around the world applauded its directors, the Wachowski Brothers (Larry and Andy), for their intelligent and keen contribution to the already wasted action flicks. Well, actually not everybody applauded, poor George Lucas did saw how his long wanted Oscar for Best Special Effects (which is what Episode I, is all about), went into the hands of Amateurs (compared to the Industrial Lights and Magic team, that have been around ever since Star Wars). 4 Academy Awards, including Best Editing, crowned the recognition as a Masterpiece, and helped the film sell more for the already trigger-happy Joel Silver (in case you are wondering, money does make you fat, right Joel?), the rest, is all history.The Matrix has tree merits that makes its first viewing a crazy ride; first, the great combination of the smart and original script, along with specially strategic cuts of the first 30 minutes, made the What's real and what's not real topic, both confusing (in the best sense of the word), and captivating, where the spectator doesn't knows what's going on, actually, it puts you in the situation of the main character, so, you are as lost as Neo is. To continue with, the excellent Kun Fu action choreography by the great Yuen Wo Ping, made every action scene to the date felt short and boring (it was shock to know that the main actors actually performed 90% of their stunts). And of course, the amazing and never before seen visual effects that where always in service of the story (the opposite of The Matrix Reloaded, and The Matrix Revolutions, where every visual effect is for free, away from any story necessity), all reunited by a accurate direction, with the help of a First class crew, made The Matrix a cinematic phenomenon. The actors where fit in their roles (Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Ann Moss, Hugo Weaving, among others, are barely O.K. in their easy characters) as the traditional heroes (Neo is basically, a black haired Luke Skywalker), and the not so traditional ones (Morpheus), hunted by the strange looking Agents, that look more like an I.R.S. employee (a nice and fresh change). The script was good enough to sustain its story weakness and character stereotypes, ending in a great rush of action and Kun Fu fights, stunning from beginning to end. The music by Don Davis, is a mediocre work, mostly saved by the good choice of songs blended with his original score.If you watch the movie carefully, you'll notice that there are 3 minor production mistakes. One belongs to the Cut, when Neo and Trinity arrives the Agent Holdings (where Morpheus is kept), the appearing of the already dress and armed police effectives happens to fast from the time the heroes arrives (a time and editing mistake). Take into consideration that after Morpheus is caught, the Agents aren't expecting the Heroes to save him). The other mistake is when the famous Rooftop Bullet-Time scene (where Neo falls back and skips the bullets), before the Agent shots towards Neo, the hero fires at Agent first (lest say some 12 shots), the Agent skips all the bullets (a frontal shot of the Agent is shown), but behind him is a very close building all covered by mirrors, the mistake is that the building is close enough to have been hit by Neo's bullets, the CGI guys miss this one, and the building is shown intact. Also in that same shot, when Neo finishes shooting towards the Agent, he throws his pistols down (just aside his feet), so during the Bullet-Time shot the pistols disappears completely, when the scene cuts away from the Bullet-Time and we see Neo on the ground, the pistols re-appear again. Anyway, this is only if you watch the movie to many times.This DVD was the first one to sell more than a million copies, after it, everything DVD rise up in huge sells. The transferring is great (the digitally grading of the film can be appreciated at its fullest), with a clean 5.1 Dolby digital, magnifying the Bullet-Time moments. The extras are quite good, specially the: Follow the white Rabbit mode, gives a different inside of the movie (the Audio Commentary is terribly boring, John Gaeta's Big Shot attitude, kills Zach Staenberg's effort to give away an entertaining and deep commentary). So, get kick into this un-realistic world of computer intelligence and Kun Fu punches.	4.0	To Blind you from the Truth.	2003-10-30	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A2HF56RKLXJJYX	Adrian P Watts	The movie is aptly named. The Matrix (or rather the Transposition Matrix) allows you to move from one Frame of Reference (as in Einstein's Theory of Relativity) to another, where each Frame of Reference is considered to be a  Vector. The special effects are superb and the story-line was generally  good - there was sufficient unpredictabilty that kept me on the edge of my  seat throughout the movie. The only thing that I could not quite  comprehend, was how a taking red pill would allow a person to transpose  from one Frame of Reference to another, or why one Frame of Reference would  be considered &quot;real&quot; and the other &quot;unreal&quot; and why it  was necessary to annihilate the Matrix. The movie forces the viewer to  accept the assumption that one Frame of Reference is not real and that the  Matrix should be annihilated.  I gave it a four star rating because while  it was thrilling and exciting - I felt a bit more could have been done with  regards to the science-fiction portion of the movie.	4.0	Inter-Dimensional Travel.	2000-01-17	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A32RDQQ47DSMYD	Aeneas	"This is still my favourite movie and one that I have seen more than 10 times. It is a movie that can be seen on many levels. Some will see it just as a great action movie which it is, but there is so much more to this film. It is a fantastic depiction of the journey of the spiritual seeker and the difficulties that he encounters within himself as he starts pushing against the prisons of his own mind and the multitude of programs that operates and which keep us small.It also neatly depicts the way humans are kept as 'food for the moon' in Gurdjieff's words or simply food for ultra terrestrials. In the film this is depicted as humans, being little less than cultivated biological batteries for the machines.The story is part of a trilogy and all three parts are worth watching more than once, as you will undoubtedly see new things each time. Things that start making sense only after some time of reflection and reading. In this regard I can recommend reading the book by Ouspensky called ""In Search of the Miraculous"", and the book by Laura Knight-Jadczyk called ""The Secret History of the World""."	5.0	TOP movie on many levels!	2007-11-18	3	3	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A1T8JBRY1Y7EST	Agent Smith	Let's face it.The 90s have witnessed a whole generation of brainless blockbuster Sci-Fi movies.Do the names ID4,Godzilla,Armageddon or the hideous Star Wars:Episode 1(what a nasty way to spoil a really interesting  trilogy)ring a bell? Then arrived The Matrix to save the film industry from  permanent brain damage,at the very end of the Millenium.This movie  proved-for the first time for all I know-that special effects shouldn't be  an excuse to dehuminaze the plot by delivering eye-candies that taste like  really bad bubblegum(hello Jar-Jar Binks).It's no wonder the Matrix has  already been made into a cult film,even more after it was announced that  this was just the first part of a trilogy. The first time I saw the film,I  was shocked,I didn't even want to turn on my computer for a while.At night  I wondered wether I really should  trust &quot;reality&quot; through my  five senses. The movie wonderfully defines the society of the 90s where  computers have &quot;made your life easier and more comfortable&quot;.For  instance,if you want to buy a pizza,you don't have to go the place,you can  order it via Internet.Or say you want to watch a Marilyn Manson concert,you  dint have to go to the show,it comes to your home.In my opinion,the  samazing scene where Neo wakes up to find himself living in a gross  cocoon,doesnt differ much from the world as it is today.People consume  everytime less energy because technology makes all the job for us.We are  turning into plants without realizing it.Even as I write this review,IT is  happenin. Other remarkable features are the Lewis Carroll references,the  monologue by...say,Agent Smith! concerning the evolution of mankind and of  course the action sequences. Of course the film has some weak spots.For  example,Morpheus' first appearance followed by a lightning,which I found a  bit clich&eacute;. Still,watching Trinity run away from the agents in a leather  outfit  at the very beginning really pays off,among other stuff. And in  case you're wondering how the hell did Agent Smith manage to write tjhis  review from Lima,Peru,think again,dont let yourself be tricked by your own  senses.I am really writing this review? Does Peru really exist? Or do you  think perhaps that's air you're breathing?	4.0	Classic Postmodern Mindbending Science Fiction Film,etc.	2000-01-17	4	2	2

0790745399	The Matrix	AIREFCQVAHKOO	A. Higgins	Look - I no great Reeves fan.  However, the movie actually has a plot that requires you to think (unlike ID4 or Phantom).  It doesn't leave you hanging at all (like &quot;Blair&quot; - a horror flick I know) and it  almost out Woos John Woo himself for action.  The hype may have let some  down.  But if you went to see the movie with an open mind, you come out  impressively suprised and happy (same with Starship Troopers).  It was  worth the $8 bucks a few times over and will be on my self in DVD as soon  as it hits.	5.0	Science Fiction with a soundtrack and setting worth the $8.	1999-08-17	0	0	0

If you are thinking of buying this movie, I highly recommend the DVD version.  The effects are much more effective and  will pull you right out of your chair.  Of course, combine this with a good  sound system as well, and this is about as close as you can get to seeing  it in the theater.  If you don't have a DVD player, I recommend you buy one  just for this movie!	5.0	Get the DVD version, it is the best!	2000-01-24	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A3BTP4OU2NQOXT	"A. I. Baruti KMT-Sisouvong ""Baruti"""	I simply do not know where to begin; however, I will do as best I can.When the movie was released the Wednesday prior to Easter, I knew something was up.  I mean, my exposure to Matrix equations in undergrad led  me to sense &quot;balls to bones,&quot; that this was a must see.  Therefore, I set out to see the movie when I left my office.  Upon my  arrival, the theatre was not as full as I anticipated; yet upon settling  in, it got a little fuller, and I was ready for anything.  Boy did I get  it.  When the movie was over, I sat there in awe.  I peeled myself from my  seat to leave.  Having done so, I, once outside of the theatre, decided to  see it again; that evening.  I have seen it so much, my colleges are  suggesting that I have a &quot;problem.&quot;  I reply, that seeking  knowledge, and its accompanying behavior has, for millennia, been regarded  as &quot;weird.&quot;This movie is crammed with many levels of  information that I, like Morpheus, tell others &quot;The Matrix, no one can  tell you what it is.  You have to see it for yourself.&quot;By far, this  movie is a thinking person's movie.  In that it deals with juxtaposing our  world as we &quot;know&quot; it with the created world of &quot;The  Matrix.&quot;  In other words, we create the reality, collectively and  individually, we experience at any given moment.  Be it our clothes,  careers, institutions, constructs, or places of residence.  We create it  all.  It is the proverbial &quot;dream world.&quot;I am choosing my  words carefully in an effort not to give the movie away.  Yet, I must say  if you are looking for an understanding of the world around you, please  see/buy this movie.  Please remember, everything in this movie has a  meaning; EVERYTHING.  Its philosophical, theological, sociological, and  esoteric messages will cause you to become not unlike myself, a walking  question mark.  Let your journey begin.Travel in peace.	5.0	Fourteen times and counting.  Signs &amp; Symbols for the mind.	1999-08-16	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A1D6DB2G7LXH4	AINTD	It does indeed. It's not an Oscar drama film nor was it ever supposed to be, so play down this argument if you ever happen to hear one. Most likely, however, you'll hear compliments to the creators for a really outstanding job, for creating what has been considered by many as &quot;the ultimate sci/fi movie&quot; before, but that sadly could hardly be ever seen. You know what a good movie should be like, you can feel it, but all movies that intend to be it usually fail and only few get to achieve this state of near perfection. These few are remembered and referenced for a very long time and Matrix is one such movie in its genre. Chances of you liking it? - 99%, leaving that 1% for somewhat twisted people who like that nobody likes and hate what everyone likes.Great production values, great acting, great plot. This movie hardly has any serious flaws worth mentioning. The movie is dynamic and has plenty of tense moments, well crafted indeed.You most certainly know the story by now, so to keep it short: A programmer for a big company (Keanu Reeves) and also a hacker in free time is troubled by a feeling that there is something terribly wrong with the entire world that sorrounds him, a feeling that would soon grow into reality as he discovers with the help of underground rebels (that the entire world is nothing more than a sophisticated setup by high-tech AI. Moment at which struggle against machines for human freedom starts.Watch it and you'll most certainly love it, that is if you mature enough to understand everything what happens on-screen.	5.0	It stands out.	2003-05-12	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A35E953ULICQFN	"""aislynmck"""	If you don't watch this movie at least 3 times, you miss out on half of the goodies. At first the effects attack you with their jarring edginess, and then the idea of a real Matrix, and finally the philosophy becomes the  sharpest edge. My whole family is full of conspiracy theorists, and this is  our new favorite. An oracle that hands out cookies? Yes indeed. Spoon  bending as a parlor trick and mind-numbing metaphor? Uh-huh. I am waiting  breathlessly for 2 and 3. I understand, also, why some may not enjoy it.  There is alot to absorb.

This was more acclaimed for it's special effects than confusing storyline.Still the DVD is full of information and had to be supplimented with The Matrix: Revisited, DVD in 2000.Now that the series is finished for now, a large box set containing all three movies and extra discs wouldn't go amiss.	4.0	What is the Matrix?	2004-04-27	1	0	1

But even though it was a very technical movie it also had a lot of human elements. It had Neo dealing with becoming The One, Trinity dealing with her love for Neo, and the whole human race dealing with slavery (although most didn't know it). Even my friends who do not like science fiction, like this movie.	5.0	Like Nothing Before	2003-09-30	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A3HV85OT7N3PY3	"a kraaiveld ""goodtastefreak"""	I watched this very soon after it hit the cinemas in the Netherlands.I was very impressed.Not only was it a thoughtprovoking movie , it was also an action movie.The Wachowski brothers would later do this again with V for Vendetta.Back then it had its share of controversy particularly the shooting in the main hall and both Neo and Trinity in leather trenchcoats.Some people saw a connection in this with the Columbine shooting but is has nothing to do with that.The picture quality of the Blu-Ray is excellent,i keep discovering new details , sound was also very good although i would have preferred DTS.If you want to buy a very good movie on Blu-Ray this is The One.	5.0	Into the rabbit hole!!	2012-02-13	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A1A4DEENGHK51T	Alan Attebery	The year is 1999........ no wait, the year is 2199..... we think. Unfortunately, machines have ruled the Earth for too long and we don't know everything that has happened. All we know is that most of humanity is in a computer program called the Matrix. Oh yeah........ the machines are using us like batteries.One of the most special effects laden movies of all time, &quot;Matrix&quot; still holds it ground as one of the best many years later. Add to that a solid story line and terrific casting, and you have the makings of a very good movie.Keanu Reeves is Neo, a computer hacker who knows that there is something more to the world than he can see but can't quite figure it out. Morphius believes that Neo is the one that can save humanity from the Matrix and, ultimately, from the machines. The Agents, machines in the Matrix, are also looking for Neo. But they do not realize just who this man really is.Part-one of a three-part trilogy, &quot;Matrix&quot; is a fast-paced action movie that will keep you riveted to your seat from start to finish. This VHS version also comes with 4 behind-the-scenes features at the end of the movie that shows you how parts of the movie were made, including the awesome &quot;bullet&quot; scene on top of the building.Eventually, all three parts of this trilogy will be offered together in some compilation DVD set, with a lot of cool extras. While you wait for that to come out, go ahead and pick up the original and enjoy it now.	5.0	I'll take the red pill anyday.....	2003-07-05	2	2	0

I already new the basic premise so it wasn't a surprise to me.  It wasn't until the SECOND time I saw it that it really hit me.  Very well written, with some philosophical underpinnings hidden throughout, the Matrix is a smart sci-fi action film -- but not TOO smart: that would have to wait until The Matrix Reloaded (which is so dense it's hard to understand what's going on with just one viewing).	5.0	&quot;Why oh why didn't I take the BLUE pill?&quot;	2004-07-12	0	0	0

It has a very creative and interesting plot, great acting, great cinematography, and best of all, the coolest and most unique action scenes ever, which have inspired many  movies after it. They even inspired video games, most notably Max Payne.Just put it this way, this movie is a work of art. This is one of the few action movies that I feel should have gone up for oscars such as best picture and best director. You can't be a serious action fan if you haven't seen this movie at least five or six times already. Take this advice from the master.	5.0	The best action/sci-fi movie EVEEERRRR!!!!	2002-03-25	1	0	1

Simply a masterpiece.  The fighting and special effects are so incredibly revolutionary that it will set the standard for movies to come for the next thousand years.  Already you can see the shockwave that it's sending through Hollywood's movies.  And after you roll up your tongue, you can watch the movie over and over again until you finally understand the movie.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3RCC8R8JZHM48	Albert M. Molina	I need not tell anymore that The Matrix is a great action-packed motion picture.  Almost all of those who have watched it could attest to that (except for the positively brain-dead), not only with its original concept  by the Wachowski Brothers (Larry and Andy rule!), but also with the  fantastic visual effects by John Gaeta, incredible fight scenes by Yuen Wo  Ping, and astounding production design by Owen Paterson.  Put together, the  product of these geniuses made a superb sci-fi action-adventure  masterpiece.In the DVD, you won't get shortchanged with all of the  special features it offers.  From the &quot;Follow the White Rabbit&quot;  behind-the-scene mode alone, you really get great value for your DVD  money.This movie really rocks!	5.0	The Movie of the Year!!!	1999-10-16	1	1	0

0790745399	The Matrix	ASC5CH6RALOHL	"Alden Utter ""nedlum"""	The Matrix, as other reviers will attest to, is a slick cyberpunk thriller set in a dismal world. However, there is one thing that must be noted, above all. No, it is not the coolness of bullet-time, though that is cool. It's not the martial arts, though they are well coreographed. And it's certainly not Reves acting. The best part of the Matrix is described in one word: Lobby.If you haven't seen the Matrix yet, I won't spoil the plot for you. However, I will just breifly describe the scene I'm refering too. In it, Neo (Reeves) enters the lobby for a high security building, of purpose unknown, and steps through a metal detector. It beeps. One of the guards walks up to him and asks him to for his keys, change...Reeves opens his trenchcoat and exposes his hardware (and no, that's not a sexual pun): about twenty assault weapons. He pushes the guard...That is the start for what is the lynchpin, the strongest scene of the film. Take out the Lobby, and you still have a fair movie. But it's missing something. The Lobby scene is easily the best gunfight ever recorded on film. The tiles of the floor shatter beautifully as Neo flips around, unscathed. And at the end, where Trinity (Moss) grabbs the bag and heads towards the elevator before the last gun can hit the scarred floor... That, more then anything else, makes me crave the Reload.	5.0	Best gunplay. Ever.	2002-10-12	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	AQ8DU6XVA3USJ	"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator"""	This is a truly great film. The premise is fascinating, the groundbreaking  effects and the cast superb, the script full of poetic ideas that spark the  imagination...but it all rests on Keanu Reeves. He IS Neo. No other actor  could have done this...the innocence/wisdom, the physical grace. Like a  god/prince in the quest for truth, the part fits him like a velvet glove  and he makes the most of it.It's a film that must be seen several  times...it can't be absorbed in one or two viewings. This is easily the  best sci-fi adventure I've ever seen, and Keanu is magnificent. Who could  ask for anything more !	5.0	Keanu is  THE ONE	2000-09-07	11	6	5

0790745399	The Matrix	A1MFGGZ4IQFL8F	A. Leung	Eye-popping special effects. Amazing Doby audio. A surprisingly deep, disturbng and meaningful plot. High-value extra features for both your  DVD-player and your DVD-Rom drive.The movie lends itself to Kung-Fu,  Science Fiction, Cyberpunk and ala-Hackers movies, and imitates them all  very well.The Matrix is godsend for those of you who love their action  movies thick and fast with that little hint of intelligence. As testament  to this, The Matrix grossed nearly US$500 million in the American  box-office last year.The world as we see it is 'not really as it seems'.  Instead, we are part of an alternate, simulated world; reality is alot  darker than it seems. Keanu Reeves is outstanding as Neo, the person whom  the story revolves around. To reveal anything more concerning the plot  would spoil the movie. Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie Ann-Moss  (trinity) also play their parts very well.The directors and the  production team also deserve high praise for the superb camera work and  sounds (they won several Academy Awards).The first viewing of The Matrix  may be puzzling because of the complications involved in the story-line and  script, but the second viewing really does reveal and uncover anything you  may have overlooked the first time.Buy The Matrix to show your friends  why you bought your DVD-player. Not only will they be impressed by the  effects, the above-average acting and the camera-work, but they will be  left genuinely puzzled by the enigmatic story.The Matrix is a smashing  film on a smashing DVD, and for viewers who are will to allow for some  creative-license and a reprise from more serious films, The Matrix is a  must-buy.Also recommended (although totally unrelated): Aving Private  Ryan, The Truman Show, Bladerunner, The Godfather, Philadelhpia	4.0	AWESOME IN-YOUR-FACE CYBER-PUNK THRILLER	2000-08-18	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A3L2RE7M2MEINB	Alexander	So, having trouble understanding the &quot;Matrix&quot;?  Let me try to assist you in your clouded view.  The Matrix is not a film about computers.  Nor is it a film about guns and violence.  Nor is it even a film about the  future.  First, erase any of these notions from your mind, and we'll start  from there.  The matrix is a film about the human race finding an energy  within themselves that will allow us maximum results from our measley  existence.  An inner 'God' if you will.  To understand the meaning behind a  film with such a vast vision, one must be able to step outside himself (as  when the film's characters went back to the spaceship) and see a world  beyond the tangible one we live in.  The film is rife with psychological  meanderings which culminate in Neo's visit to the oracle.  If you'll  remember the oracle asks Neo (in so many words) if he thinks he is  &quot;the one&quot;.  Neo says &quot;no&quot;.  Had Neo said yes, then he  would've surely been recognized as the one.  It's simple: everyone is  &quot;the one&quot;! and the theatrical fact that there was a race of  machines smarter than ourselves, which created the world we see and feel  while really hiding their true agenda is a fantastic metaphor for finding  that space within ourselves that can allow us to 'bend spoons' mentally.  And to have the world on a string.  The action in the movie serves to keep  you focused on plot.  Now, having read this review, watch the film again  and understand it's true meaning.	3.0	Read This Review!	1999-11-22	54	18	36

0790745399	The Matrix	ACAO2J1XCS4FL	Alexander Suraev	The most pretentious, tasteless and pseudo-meaningful movie I've seen.I can explain it's success only by the lack of something better. If it was to  be released in the summer of 1997 it  would be no match to The Fifth  Element,Men In Black and Face\Off.The plot is a total patchwork of  &quot;Zen Made Simple&quot; and &quot;Aliens Rule The Earth&quot;  brochures. What is The Matrix? - is the most annoying and stupid question  with nothing behind it. The fighting sequences are pathetic. Of course I  know that the Chinese martial artists train from 2-3 year old  and Keanu  Reeves had only 2-3 months to learn the moves but does it mean we have to  appreciate his laughable efforts?Laughable is the key word if you want  to survive this pure gem of bad taste and intellectual inferioriity. My  favourite scene takes place in a car where two ladies forcefully extract  the slimy insect from Keanu's navel. They use the strange gadget probably  obtained from the nearest sex-shop and poor guy looks as if he is afraid of  being castrated right on spot. And for the first few seconds the ladies do  nothing to dispel his fears. It's so delightfully stupid!The costume  design is just horrendous.

0790745399	The Matrix	A9998RE3AEA95	Alex	The matrix has a unique ( for a movie) storyline, but it is very poorly thought out. The concept has gaping loopholes in it ( why did the robotic intelligence bother with the VR if brain-dead bodies produce as much  electricity as normal ones?). Like stated below, the dialogue is simplistic  at best. I understand that most of the viewers are in for the eye-candy and  not the lingo, and I am not opting for the level of lingual sophistication  of the Murder on the Millennium Falcon ( a book, not film), but the  characters could have easily used just a tad bit more plain intelligence...  Another topic: the unecessary violence - just consider this:&quot; We are  going to save the humanity from a virtual prison - and now let's gun down  the twelve hundred guards that stand between us and that door!&quot; I  would have honestly liked the movie a great much better if the plot was  more styled toward th thrill and the mystery rather than the special  effects (all of which have been fully blown in the commercials - technicly,  if you've seen the commercials, you've seen the movie).

0790745399	The Matrix	AF1VHA7BVWLO1	Alexia Komaux	The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.	5.0	appropriately snuck into the American zeitgeist like a computer virus in the brain.	2005-11-04	3	2	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A3TY24OOYVJZQM	Al Lal, al_lal@hotmail.com	The Matrix is a science-fiction and action film that weaves within it the message that is subersive and dangerous.  This is a very enjoyable science-fiction film that explores the nature of reality.Neo is the hero  (his name means NEW or CHANGE) and he is contacted by Morpheus -- the most  dangerous man alive, and a terrorist.  The movie is subversive in a very  clever way, the hereos are terrorists who are willing and able to gun down  security agents and law officers.  They state that if you are not part of  the solution, then you are part of the problem.  The film is very cleverly  anti-government, and anti-law, and promotes voilence against the  governement and the populace.This is a brilliant film that should be  watched by everyone.  You can simply watch it as a science-fiction action  film, or you can understand the philosophical and mystical messages in it,  or finally the revelation: the political and social messages in it.You  need to watch the film at least three times, and listen to the dialogue  carefully to understand it.  This film demands multiple viewings, and is a  film that should be owned.  With the layers of meanings in the film, and  the messages weaved into the story, it makes for a very watchable film.  The special effects are also brilliant, as are the sets.	4.0	Matrix -- A subersive and dangerous film	2000-07-07	1	0	1

But which of those is his &quot;real&quot; job?  Neither one, it turns out, in this widely influential and imitated  sci-fi thriller.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; presupposes that it isn't nineteen  ninety-something any longer but twenty-two something, that all the  &quot;realities&quot; Keanu has known have been false, and that only  through the help of a mentor (played by Laurence Fishburne) will he get to  the alarming &quot;real&quot; reality that confronts mankind, which has  become a slave to doomsday technology.Whether you know it or not, this  movie has already influenced other movies and TV shows, even TV  commercials.  Its technical achievements were recognized at the Academy  Award ceremonies, making it that rarity--a popular cult hit.  Watching this  film is not a passive viewing experience, it's more like a theme-park ride.

The guy who made it (sorry I don't know who) obviously wanted to  create a really fun, really intense and meaningful action movie (with lots  of cool effects I might add) and he definitely did so.

I really enjoyed the added  features of the DVD, including actor profiles and how the effects were  done.  A visual feast for anyone, especially those who enjoy sci-fi or  futuristic drama.  Although like most these days, this movie has enough  people getting blown away by big automatic weapons to last for me for a  millennium, the other details were just so amazing that I was able to look  beyond that for once.  I liked the fact that Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss),  was a strong woman but still had a very compassionate and vulnerable side.  Of course, Keanu Reeves is very easy to look at and was good in the  character of Neo.  This is one of the few movies I want to watch several  times over.

Neo thinks he's living in the &quot;real world&quot; when two people by the name of Morpheus and Trinity finds him and proves that an artificial intelligence called &quot;The Matrix&quot; is controlling the &quot;real world&quot; and that it must be destroyed. The cyber rebels combat against police officers, SWAT teams and professional agents who have the ability to morph that guard and are loyal to The Matrix. By using martial arts and knowledge from computers that process knowledge into their minds and special powers, these cyber rebels fight for real freedom from The Matrix. The visuals such as the kung fu scene between Morpheus and Neo, and the fight bewteen Neo and Agent Smith are incredible. The action such as the scene where Neo and Trinity combat against SWAT teams are also cool but do not see this movie if you are infulenced by violence because some people blame this movie for school shootings.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3RNSUUNSSRBSK	"Amazon Customer ""ktazle99"""	The Matrix could be viewed as a turning point in modern movies. It was the first major production that introduced the idea that the world isn't what it seems. Lots of the special effects were created for the movie. I thought the whole thing was very innovative.Thomas Anderson was a fairly normal guy. He had a day job with a respectable programming company, and he did a little less honest business on the side. The only thing that was wrong was that he was looking for the answer to a question: what is the matrix? Unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is, but they can be shown. Somewhat to his dismay, he was shown. Some problems arise, as you may have suspected, and Anderson, better known as Neo, finds a nice violent solution. Generally I avoid 'R' movies, but this one is an exception. I would say that only reason it was 'R' was because of the disturbing, sci-fi themes; anyone without a firm, established belief about life may end up a little rattled by the end of the movie.	5.0	One word: WOW!	2003-01-04	8	3	5

0790745399	The Matrix	A1VHK9A4VLJTHC	"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly"""	One of my favorite all time movies and certainly a title that can be watched over and over.First off this movie is simply one of the greatest sci fi movies ever made, much better than the Star Wars or Star Trek films simply because the writing of this script was so well done.  The incredible cinematography and special effects that went into making this film would make it worth watching alone even if the plot, story and characters weren't all that great, but thankfully they are that and more.The story is a Christology in part and an allegory that leans so towards the Christian experience  that either the writers are believers or perhaps they just feel Christ and the beliefs that surround Him are such good myths that they'd high jack the premise and make a modern science fiction story about it.  The quickie dictionary definition of an allegory is this: &quot;the expression through symbolism of truths about human experience&quot; and this movie does a good job of using symbolism to show us where we really are (at least from the Christian stand point).This world is not real in the sense that our surroundings are mostly just &quot;sensory perception&quot; our real persona has its existence in another dimension. And to believers this world isn't our true home, we are &quot;Strangers in a Strange Land&quot; (and like in  R.A.H's famous book of the same name, Michael is able to manipulate &quot;physical&quot; reality as is Neo in The Matrix simply because they see it for what it really is.)  &quot;What is Real?&quot; asks Morpheus (named after the Greek god of dreams) of Neo  (new) the one he believes might be the &quot;one&quot;, the messiah figure predicted by the Oracle.Take the blue pill and continue your life as it is (reject true reality in favor of comfort) or take the red pill (symbolic of the blood perhaps?) and you can never go back.  Painful, yet necessary rebirth occurs, one's real self is allowed to be alive.  &quot;My eyes hurt&quot; - &quot;Because you've never used them before&quot;Evil personified is bent on keeping humans blind so that they can be consumed.  In this movie the reason is technical and has to do with physical energy, but the premise is not new, in 'The Screwtape Letters' (C.S. Lewis) the consumption is of  spiritual energy, but the allegory remains constant and I think that the idea (whether one is religious or not) hits close to home in us all.Of course the often shown highlight scene of Neo dodging bullets, the karate fight scene and many other great technical stunts make this movie a great joy to watch, but watch it several times, because many of the messages are caught the second, third or in later viewings.When all seems lost Trinity proclaims that she is no longer afraid.Too much from a techo/sci fi movie?

There is a clear message that doesn't get lost in the amazing special effects.  DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE FIRST 10 MINUTES.  They  are a little slow, but the movie picks up very well, and stays at the  faster pace.  The plot, though a tad predictable in places, isn't  contrived.  There are several unexpected plot twists. The special effects  are unbeliveable, yet fit in perfectly with the premise.  This is not a  &quot;we have a great effect, how can we use it&quot; movie, but a &quot;we  have a great script, how can we film it&quot; one.  This is not a movie to  miss.

Not only is it easy to comprehend, but also has a lot of complex themes concerning philosophy, sociology, and mythology (and perhaps theology, although that is more apparent in the sequels).  Each new viewing reveals something new to think about.*Filming style is excellent, even when the camera is not doing a 360-degree turn.  It's fresh, original, and has many strong motifs.  The use of colors is excellent as well.*Now that I've seen it five times, I can see strong continuity with the sequels.*Awesome music.The Bad Things*A little slow for the first half.  All of the fighting is more in the end.*Those who do not like action movies may find this stupid.I still consider this to be an absolute favorite.  Aside from mind-bending action and effects, the story is swell and has lots of awesome, memorable characters.  Themes and motifs are strong, and with each new viewing, something new can be discovered.  It is even stronger now that the sequels are out, and one can see how all three films work together as a whole.  It is constantly refreshing and exciting to watch this, for it is probably the most intelligent action movie ever made.  If all action movies were made this way, perhaps Hollywood could redeem itself!

0790745399	The Matrix	A1GOI8745FGIDN	"""an_avid_book_reviewer"""	"I liked this movie only for the idea of the matrix itself.  I don't think anything else in it is likely to ever happen.  I mean, if we created machines that could think for themselves and did not serve us, and even if they did take over humanity, don't you think they could find a better energy source than human bodies?  In the movie, the humans are in comas and they have tubes coming out of them which supposedly extract the energy that the AI machines need.  Even if they did do this, why would they need to put the humans in the matrix?  If they're in comas, what difference does it make to them whether the humans have no consciousness at all, or they believe the matrix to be real life?  Also, I think if the machines were this advanced, that they'd be able to totally eliminate any chance of resistance.But like I said, I found the concept of a matrix interesting.  The matrix is already real in the sense of the internet-- it is certainly a ""place"" where things happen, people ""go"" and communicate, etc, yet it does not physically exist anywhere.  It's all theoretical, but theoretically, an infinite amount of matrices could be created.  Each person could be on his own matrix, interacting with people that do not exist.  In the movie, the matrix was a copy of what the world used to be like, whereas meanwhile it has been utterly destroyed by the machines.  In a matrix, anything can happen.  A matrix could be used to punish criminals beyond imagination.  If you liked this movie, read ""1984"" and merge the two.  Scary thought, eh?  With the matrix, a dictator could gain unlimited power.  Since in a matrix, anything can literally happen, that means a dictatorship could do anything they wanted if they controlled a matrix world.  On the other hand, a utopia could just as easily be created.  The only problem is each person has their own idea of utopia but that is no problem either.  A different matrix could be made for each person, or groups of people, etc.  Also, people may get into a medical condition where they can be kept alive by having machines breathe for them and pump their heart, but not fully revive them.  In this situation there are many people who would rather live in a matrix than either die or live indefinitely in a coma.  The concept of a matrix brings philosophical questions.  Is a matrix real?  If you define ""real"" as something you can verify with the five senses, then yes, the matrix is just as real as the ""real world.""  Yet, it just doesn't seem real even though I can't think of a better definition for ""real.""  It also makes striving for a better world seem pointless because this world could be essentially erased like it was in the movie, and moreover, a million matrices could be created.  So think of how insignificant you are in this world, and multiply that by a million.  The only people with any real power at all (and they would have a LOT) would be the ones who design and operate the matrices.  Although not stressed in the movie, it also calls into question free will.  Surely in a matrix our free will could be totally taken away and our every movement and thought controlled by a computer, unknown to us.  That is, if we even have free will.  A scarier thought-- what if we're in a matrix now?  How would we know?  It reminds me of ""The Truman Show,"" where Truman is filmed unknowingly and all his friends and neighbors are all actors in the show.  But in the matrix, control over the subjects can become absolute.  Truman eventually discovered what was going on and broke free from the set and into the real world.After watching ""Artificial Intelligence,"" ""Bicentenial Man"", and ""The Matrix,"" I have one question for Hollywood:  ""When will you make a movie that shows technology HELPING mankind, which is the whole point of it?"""	3.0	Simplistic and unrealistic portrayal of advanced technology.	2002-06-13	4	2	2

While some might view it no more than a cool comic book adaptation, it is much more than that.  The Matrix taps into some of the most difficult questions of existence such as pleasure vs. morality, reality vs. perception.  It is a grandiose twist of the idea of dream skepticism, which aims to entertain wast audience appealing to teens as well as adults.  The Matrix has already became part of our (Western) culture.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2ZAQNY16LCS0S	Andres Baca	Wow... this movie is a fabulous on many different levels I could write pages and pages of praise, but for this review I'm going to take this  perspective even though this is not an Asimov creation but rather a  Wachowski brother brainchild:  &quot;Asimov's 3 laws of  Robotics[and artificial intelligence]:&quot;  1.A robot[or artificial being] may not injure a human being or, through  inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.  2.A robot[or  artificial being] must obey the orders given to it by human beings except  where such orders would conflict with the first law.  3.A  robot[or artificial being] must protect its own existence as long as such  protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.  Whereas the  Asimov classic short story Bicentennial man deals with robots (and AI) not  having enough rights. This movie deals with AI having too much control...  total control in fact they totally violate the three laws!  Interchange  the words &quot;human being&quot; with &quot;robot/ai&quot;, read the three  laws again in this manner and that is the world of the Matrix, the robots  rule! for Without giving any plot points away, at one part of The Matrix  Sentient program:Agent Smith mentions that human beings are &quot;the  cancer of this planet and [the robots]are the cure&quot;. This kind of  implies that the people that created this AI world run amok probably did it  for environmental reasons.  In Asimov's robots stories there is  talk about robots having &quot;solved the ecological crisis&quot; but still  not being accepted into the society. Comparison between these two great  stories shows that being partisan about anything is dangerous. The middle  road (balancing robot/AI rights and not giving robots/AI too much power) is  the desirable route.  In Frank Herbert's Dune (the novel not the  horrible movie of the same name) there is talk of a very Matrix like  &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; a war of humans against thinking machines and  computers. In Dune the robots are wiped out, in Asimov stories the only  legal place to have working AI and robots is in space stations. In The  Matrix... well, you'll have to watch this excellent movie to find out...	5.0	Comparisons to other science fiction Masterpieces	2000-09-03	0	0	0

The  story is one that we have seen variations of before, where a character is a  modern day savior or Jesus Christ if you will. But this is told in a very  entertaining manner and is very well written.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2AE10QQVZIK9W	Andrew Saroch	At a time when Hong Kong has forgotten what made their films great, Hollywood thought they'd try to remind them with The Matrix. Anyone who's seen Iceman Cometh, Dragon From Russia, Saviour of the Soul or countless  other Hong Kong classics will be able to pick out scenes re-created in The  Matrix. One of the kings of Hong Kong, Yuen Woo Ping, does a good job with  the action and the effects are excellent. However, what the film lacks is  the real core that made films like Saviour of the Soul great. The mixture  of humour, action, suspense and romance simply doesn't click in The Matrix.  Everyone is applauding Carrie Ann Moss's character, but Michelle Yeoh  combined fighting ability and femininity far better in Royal Warriors or  Project S.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1J2N91CO3KKWL	Andy Nguyen	the Matrix fell quite short of my expectations, it is painfully cliche,  theres a good guy and a bad guy, the good guy fights some crucial battle  with the bad guy and wins of course, been there, seen that, its way too  predictable. The story has little depth and just comes down to shootouts  full of special fx, only some one with the taste of a 7year old would call  this good movie making, there is no character development, no depth,  nothing but guns and explosions. Keanu Reeves takes the tiring &quot;act as  little as possible&quot; routine to a new level, as do the rest of the  cast. So bottom line: you can go here just for the special fx but it aint  worth seeing again due to a total lack of decent acting and a good story  line	3.0	Little More than Run-and-Gun Special FX	2000-08-09	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A33AJ1MSMEIA3C	Anne	While I can certainly appreciate the Brothers' attempt to bring a masterpiece to live action film, and ultimately, the masses - I don't really care for some of their changes.The actors, especially, could have been better chosen.  Aside from the new addition, Neo, I don't think any of the characters lived up to their animated counter-parts - particularly 'Trinity'.  Although she does look quite a bit like the Major in the original movie, her acting is nothing to write home about and she only came off as trying way too hard.As for the story, considering the sources, it ended up dumbed-down and convoluted.  Something that needed to happen, I suppose, for it's mainstream success; but for those of us with expectations. . . disappointing.If the film were a stand-alone, it may have been better off.  But given the history of what it tried to imitate, it ended up lacking in some areas.But again, I appreciate the attempt.  So, 3 stars for effort (which I am grateful for, no matter how botched), and a star for visual execution.Definitely worth seeing.  But, do yourself a favor and have a look at the original sources on which The Matrix is based.	4.0	Nice Try at a Live-action Ghost In The Shell	2007-03-30	8	1	7

0790745399	The Matrix	AK6UVFSU07NXH	Anthony Hinde	Ever wanted to be important, to live a life that matters? Well take a look at &quot;The Matrix&quot; because it starts with the premise that we are  all living pointless lives, slaves to frighteningly powerful beings that  prevent everyone from knowing their true state. Here enters the myth. There  will come a redeemer, who will see through all deception and become the  perfect warrior in mankind's cause. He will be the &quot;ONE&quot;.I don't know what possessed the Wachowski brothers to turn a borderline  successful comic book idea into a sixty million dollar extravaganza. But  WOW! I'm so glad they did. Talk about entertainment, this film keeps your  butt firmly on the edge of your seat and your jaw on the floor. The action  is intense, the plot is multi-layered and the effects are sumptuous. I  should also point out that for a cast that knows little about martial arts,  (a few months training prior to the filming), they sure can fake it. You  will believe a man can fly.Science fiction has explored the  implications of virtual reality fairly thoroughly over the past two  decades. From Steven Lisberger's &quot;Tron&quot; to Star Trek's &quot;Holo  Deck&quot;, we're well versed on the idea that the virtual will some day  rival the actual. With The Matrix however, it is all brought  together into  a frightening whole. At times you will wonder about your own reality... what  if?But then, we don't need to wonder, because it's laid out clear  and sharp on the big screen. Imagine a world were the entire population  lives in jelly filled pods, jacked into a simulation as real as God's  imagination. Except for a few &quot;naturals&quot;, who have either been  born outside of the Matrix or brought out, the populous goes about their  angst filled lives, little knowing how pointless it all is. Talk about an  existentialist's wet dream. But what of those non-conformists on the  outside?We meet them through Neo, a corporate neophyte and part  time hacker. The powers-that-be have turned their attention to young Neo,  (Keanu Reeves), not for his illegal computer hobbies but because the  mysterious Morpheus,  leader of the underground, has shown an interest in  him. Thus commences Neo's fall into wonderland and as with Alice, there are  strange creatures, confusing situations and rulers who seem keen to take  his head.Dragged kicking and screaming out of the Matrix and into  the real world, Neo learns the truth and finds he now has the  responsibility of saving the world, thrust on his sculpted shoulders. He's  not alone though, Morpheus and the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar (a strange  and futuristic vessel that is their real world home), are just as keen to  reclaim the planet. Morpheous becomes Neo's mentor, teaching him the skills  he needs to do battle with the master machines. Their evil face is  expressed within the Matrix in the form of seemingly invulnerable Agents.  And all Neo has to do, is the impossible... with a little love on the side.  Perfect!	5.0	Open your eyes copper top!	2000-08-22	2	0	2

The acting is excellent, the fight scenes are excellent, the special effects are excellent, the script is excellent, etc....I'll admit, this movie doesn't create &quot;deep thought&quot; or anything--I mean, most of its concepts get hashed out in any philosophy 101 course, and you'd have to be a simpleton to not understand it.  However, the concepts ARE well-executed, usually consistent, and I am honestly looking forward to the sequals/prequals.One question--if Neo was stuck in an intravenous-computer-lifepod thingy, how on earth did he even manage to thrash and keep afloat once he's released and falls into the water?  In my opinion, he should have sunk like a brick or floated lifelessly like a deflated balloon....and I am curious as to the writers' explanation of why the computers (creators of the Matrix itself) actually &quot;programmed in&quot; the Oracle and don't know about her, and is her comment about the vase going to end up as some Leibnizien version of free-will?Time will tell, hopefully.	5.0	Not high philosophy or anything, but a truly good time.	2001-06-01	1	0	1

My children who were too young (much too young) to appreciate &#34;The Matrix&#34; when it was first released find it spell-binding to watch now -- as though on a primal level the movie reveals hints of something that the subconscious mind knows to be real.

I remember the first time I saw it, I had to come back to the boxoffice and pay for another ticket, immediately after I exited. I don't remember ever doing that ever and again. I was that stunned by the visuals and the storyline. Before all the imitations arrived, this movie had it all, mind-blowing special effects and an absorbing premise about the future that is both scary and quite probable. I'm not so taken by the sequels though, but that's understandable, this is quite a tough act to follow.	5.0	the Godfather of sci-fi	2005-08-17	1	1	0
0790745399	The Matrix	AT6YJOEWCBRPQ	Arooj Shaikh	This is one of those movies that apparently inspires either great admiration or disappointment.  I must thank the prior reviewers (especially those rating it relatively low) who have helped me place some of the  techniques and ideas into perspective.  However, I think &quot;The  Matrix&quot; is more than a collection of martial arts effects applied to  cyberspace - there are significant allusions to the concepts of free will,  destiny, and even religious philosophy.As an example, anyone with even  a little religious conviction of any kind has to believe, at some level,  that this world is impermanent and (to a degree) illusory, kind of like the  simulated world of the matrix; yet nihilism is not a way out because what  occurs here has &quot;real&quot; consequences (remember Neo's bloody mouth  after his first attempt in jumping?).  It's not an original idea, but I  think the combination of dialogue, effects, and setting along with the  &quot;deep&quot; ideas within it make the movie compelling.	5.0	An excellent smorgasbord for the mind	1999-08-08	0	0	0

That said, I must also say that &#34;the truth is in the numbers,&#34; and that scene where Neo and Trinity went to rescue Morpheus was TOTALLY HOT!!!

0790745399	The Matrix	A2VMT89TCSF105	"Ashtar Command ""Seeker"""	"""The Matrix"" is literally the BEST movie I've ever seen!! I don't know how many times I've seen it: on cinema, on TV, on VCR. Sorry, I don't have a DVD (must be the last person in the Matrix who doesn't!). So why is the movie just GREAT?I guess its the combination. There's really heavy philosophy, astounding special effects, intruiging music, a lot of kung-fu and yes, a lot of completely unmotivated VIOLENCE!!! And, there's no sex. Thanks. Can't stand that in a cinema, I mean really...Best scene: Morpheus is held in custody by the Secret Police. Neo and Trinity has to save him. Catch: the HQ of the Secret Police is guarded by like 1000 cops. Does the rescue mission succeed? Well... Let's just say ""we need guns, lots of guns"". And that chopper that collides with the skyscraper...Oh MAAAN!As for the philosophy, being the philosophical type (seriously, I don't take kung fu lessons, not even from Mr. Miyagi), I relished in that too. The Warchowski brothers have succeeded in creating a very clever, almost genial, indeed almost too clever, Gnostic or Hindu-Buddhist allegory. It's all there: the ""machines"" who keep humanity in thrall are the Archonts or the Asuras, the Matrix is maya or the world of illusion, Neo is a Gnostic or Tibetan Messiah who acquires superhuman strength when realizing that the world is just an illusion. And yes, the humans who don't want to be saved by Morpheus and his commando group, people like Cipher, well...that's us! ""Ignorance is bliss"".And in case you missed it, the movie also contains a really bad joke. Cipher is called ""Mr.Reagan"" and wants to ""forget everything"" and ""be someone important, like a movie star"". This is a reference to Ronald Reagan, the former movie actor and US president who eventually turned senile. Although I didn't fancy Reagan, this joke is...well, a bit low.But despite that, I nevertheless give this movie 5 stars. Indeed, I would give it 10 stars if possible.

I've now seen this  movie over 15 times, and still enjoy it every time. The extras are great,  but the movie itself holds up for multiple viewings - great storyline,  incredible special effects. Keanu Reeves is not the best actor in the  world, but he was perfect for this role - his &quot;Whoa!&quot; is one of  the best moments of the film, an inflection he carried over from his Bill  and Ted Days. So, if you don't yet have this DVD in your collection, don't  delay in adding it - you won't be disappointed.	5.0	Looking for the perfect first DVD?	2000-09-07	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A2ILOYARQVO4K1	"A. Temple ""fiber_optiq"""	This movie has exactly two things to recommend it:1. Cool special effects.2. Foetus farms.Other than that, this movie is utter trash.  Those of you who don't want your virgin eyes spoiled by knowing what the movie is about (like anyone doesn't know by now) should not read what follows, because it is a long list of everything WRONG with the movie--not counting the fact that the (supposedly mind-blowingly original) concept behind it has been done by countless sci-fi movies and books for decades--and I may accidentally drop a few hints as to the nature of the plot of this, um, flick.1. The Oracle.  It's stupid, it makes no sense, and it has nothing to do with anything.2. The fact that Neo comes back to life when Trinity kisses him.  I mean, come ON, can't we think of anything cleverer than THAT?3. The idea of getting energy from humans, forgetting the fact that you'd have to put more energy into them than you'd get out.4. Beings that control all aspects of your perception using fallible, killable agents that (mostly) obey the laws of physics, when they could just make you think an anvil fell on your head and crushed you.5. The fact that unplugging someone causes them to die, rather than simply to come out of the matrix.  Isn't that what happened to Neo when he took the pill anyway?6. Telephones. This was the most irritating thing in the entire movie.  WHY, may I ask, is it necessary to pick up a telephone to emerge from this virtual universe?7. If deja vu is when there's a glitch and &quot;they&quot; reset something, shouldn't everyone get it at the same time?8. The ripply-helicopter-building-crash thing.  Some people explain this by saying that &quot;they&quot; don't know how to deal with disasters of that magnitude, but what about volcanoes, earthquakes, etc.?9. All the stupid Biblical metaphors and whatnot.  They really don't make that much sense once you analyze them.So there you have it.  On the one hand, you have the red pill--logic, reason, internal consistency, intellectual value.  On the other, you have the blue pill--foetus farms. Which do you choose?	2.0	oh, please...	2001-01-06	22	6	16

0790745399	The Matrix	A3S87ZOPB3UM9N	atmj	Based on the previews, I had no idea what the movie was about exactly.  It was better than I imagined and I am a sci-fi buff.In a nutshell,  without ruining it for those who haven't seen it.A computer programmer  who haunts the net, feels that his reality isn't quite what it seems to be.  Somehow, a strange woman becomes aware of his quest for answers.  She  puts him in contact with a mysterious man, who hints at an alternate  reality and nothing he has every dreamed of.However, his choice at  revealing that alternate reality has no ability to return to the reality he  knows.  He must make a choice.  In the meantime, a group of mysterious  men, accost him at work and question what he knows of the mysterious man  and women. The inquistion gets pretty scary.Needless to say Keanu Reeves  character, opts to find out what this alternative reality is.  Then it  gets really cool.Maybe I missed this in many of the sci-fi movies I've  seen, but this is an angle about reality that I never imagined.  It must've  taken this generation of writers to imagine what virtual reality could do  to come up with that.  It really stretches the imagination.  Puts a new  twist on the energizer bunny.I thought the special effects were great.  Mind you a bit on the violent side, but that does sell with this  generation.  I appreciate the fact that it was not gory, just mostly  destructive.Keanu Reeves was perfect for this role.  He had the look and  style to pull it off.  It is nice when a person that was a young star  matures into his roles and changes with his own seasons.I know some of  the guys were dissappointed that there was a love story plopped in the  middle of it, but I think that's what makes it even more interesting.You  can't beat the big screen for this type of action flick.  However, I bought  the tape just to watch it every now and then for it's fabulous special  effects.  It is easy to see new things in it each time.It it over the  top?  You betcha, but quite frankly, if it wasn't, it wouldn't be science  fiction.  Does it have some holes in it's theories? yup.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2HNAMD95KMIZ4	aux	This film, in my opinion is a fantastic fusion of action and an excellent plot.  This movie uses groundbreaking special effects to compliment one of the deepest plots in any recent film.  The main character Neo(Keanu Reeves) is a hacker who is contacted by Morpheus and informed that he is &quot;The One&quot; who will save the &quot;Real World&quot; and that the world we live in is a computer program designed to use humans as batteries to use for energy for the robots that have taken over the world.  The rest of the movie chronicles Neo's quest to save the human race.  The plot in this movie keeps the viewer thinking, wile the action keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I would recommend this film to all action film lovers as well as someone just looking for a movie that is a technical masterpiece.	5.0	One of the Best Films of th 1990s	2003-10-15	4	2	2
0790745399	The Matrix	AJ57K3QG32CNK	Avant-Captain_Nemo	This movie is one big dull bunny of a tale.  Neo has nothing going in him at all and as the series developed he got worse.  He is as flatsouled and as empty as a house abandoned even by the demons and the ghosts.  His fall for Morpheus demonstrates the gullibility and even narcisitic death urges that lurk in his puerile soul.  Only a death urge and an extreme infatuation with himself, covertly needin g massive doses of ego-stroking could possibly explain how he fell for that equally shallow, utterly pretentious snake-oil salesman Morpheus.  I feel terribly bad for Lawrence Fishburn who is a tremendous actor, capable of roles more complex and interesting that the mono-maniacal con-man strait jacket he allowed himself to get pressed into.  Neo is the Messiah?  I prefer the scruffy, complicated, firey man from Nazareth.  This movie has been praised as innovative by people who are ignorant of the fact that all of its best ideas were stolen and mutilated from more competent science fiction writers.  How about the spirituality of the Matrix?  Millions of other-wize decent people have almost worshipped this film - as if it were a Revelation from the spiritual world.  I find the &quot;spirituality&quot; of this film to be cheap.  It lacks all of the complexity, difficulty, and traumas of real spirituality.  Spirituality is a world of tiny deeds unnoticed, momentary ecstasys, deep sadness, joys that cannot be comphrehended, momentary brawls with the spirits, midnight fist fights with God, beauty, and service.  The spirituality of this film is pure, self-congratulatory violence.  It is yet another Rambo-as-Frankenstein's monster film that seems to gratify American audiences who cannot get enough of killing in the name of God.  Don't buy it.  Don't waste the money.  You'll regret it. Go out and do something good for yourself and the people you love.	1.0	Big dull bunny of a tale.	2004-05-26	36	15	21
0790745399	The Matrix	A1RL40OZ3R5XZV	"""aviendha"""	This is the ultimate in SciFi.  Though, I think they borrowed a great deal from the World of Darkness gaming system.  It's very much like &quot;Mage&quot;.I was a little worried when I first heard that Keanu  Reeves was in this movie.  He's a terrible actor.  He's monotone, and  ruined what could've been an otherwise good film in A Walk in the Clouds.  However, somehow... they managed to make a fantastic movie, with him  involved.  Others have noted, and I also point out, that Keanu really  doesn't speak much in this show.  He does a lot of posing and looking  cool... perfectly appropriate for the film, and has a lot of short lines.  Somehow the Director made it work, and Keanu was very good in the role.  I  recommend this movie highly, on VHS or DVD.	5.0	A Fantastic Movie	2000-04-27	0	0	0

At one point, Morpheus offers Neo two pills: one pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small . . . and Neo chooses the one which Morpheus says will show him how far down the rabbit hole goes.Somebody (maybe everybody) has considerable experience with psychoactive drugs here. Sorting out which is ""reality"" and which is the matrix (that is, an artificial program to keep humans in line) is just a hang-up for the audience. The characters seem to realize that, as Robin Williams pointed out, reality is just a concept.I couldn't help thinking of the movie ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" which I may review next. I've got it here, and it seems fitting.It is extremely difficult to describe this movie. It is clearly done mostly with computers, but then that is the point of the story itself, so it has a looking-glass aspect. And in fact, there is much of Lewis Carroll in this movie, along with some taste of kung fu and anime. The matrix program characters are apparently Japanese and run in columns instead of rows. But mostly what there is is LSD, mescaline and peyote. I've had enough experience to recognize it when I see it.Anyway, hacker Neo gets caught up in a group of rebels from the Matrix. He thought he was in 1999, but that was the Matrix; the ""real world"" is in ""something like"" 2199; they are not sure of the date. Morpheus believes Neo is ""The One,"" the person they have been looking for all their lives who can destroy the power of the Matrix.I think if I watch it another dozen times, I may come to understand it somewhat.

This DVD has more  extras and better extras than any DVD I have watched so far.  BTW-My  Toshiba SD-1200 DVD player handles anything this DVD can give out with no  problems at all, so you don't need the most expensive equipment to reap all  the benefits of this high quality DVD.  Now, why did I give this DVD only 4  stars?  Because of the little disclaimer on the back of the package:  &quot;The enhanced DVD-ROM features will not work on a MacIntosh  computer.&quot;  And they won't.  For leaving out a large segment of this  DVD's audience, the manufacturer's have to lose some points.  And that's a  shame.	4.0	I wanted to give it 5 stars.  I really did!	2000-08-16	1	1	0

It just may be possible that for other reasons Morpheus may be looking for Neo.The movie producers get points for it the first people to do the particular FX.This film even though it has a beginning and an end is really the first is a series that unfolds a further truth.Keanu Reeves plays his part well; however, he is better as Siddhartha in ""Little Buddha"" (1994).

Keanu Reeves  is great in the role of Neo, who carries the responsibility of  disconnecting the human race from the Matrix. Laurence Fishburne is also  great as Morpheus; Neo's mentor. Hugo Weaving also draws one of the best  sci/fi villains as Agent Smith. It ultimately succeds in being an extremely  entertaining and well done action/Sci-Fi movie.

Keanu Reeves, by choosing to do this movie, proved conclusively that you don't have to be the smartest man in the room to be a central and integral part of something amazing.This movie redefined what science fiction, heck, what reality is to me.Endless possibilities.When an ordinary man can be superman. Then an ordinary man can be God. An ordinary woman can be a vixen. An ordinary digital life form can be an extraordinary antagonist. And an ordinary reality can come to life in it's own way and present ideas, clues, and stories to involve and engage the audience in such a way, that you both don't want to be a part of it because of the atrocities depicted, but you feel compelled to because you know there's more to life than the atrocities displayed.This is a thinking man's movie. It's an enabler. And with it's amazing characters who aren't just shallow robots following a script, they all have a life and mind and motivations of their own which to this day make me glad to be a part of it all.	5.0	Redefining and Amazing	2014-06-04	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A24AAZLXP428VG	Big Dog	"It didn't take long for cyberspace to fill up with comparisons between The Matrix and Blade Runner - but where are the comparisons to 2001 and The Terminator.  When Blade Runner was originally released in 1982, it was  considered to be a truly visionary prediction on what the future could  hold.  We knew that technology would have a profound effect on us, but  Rigley Scott's masterpiece envisioned technology embodied in the form of  human beings.  Blade Runner borrowed the concept of machines struggling to  be human from another great science fiction epic of the late 60's,  2001 -  A Space Odyssey.  Although Kubrick and Scott both demonstrated an  incredible sense of foresight, they could not have anticipated  how  technology would truly develop.  James Cameron, who recently sank the  Titanic to cash in $$$, also demonstrated vision in the sci-fi/action  magnum opus, The Terminator.Fast-forward 17 years from Blade Runner  and The Terminator to 1999 and the birth of The Internet.  Andy and Larry  Wachowski  take Kubrick's original vision  plus 30 years of  technological  innovation and blow past Scott and Cameron to create what should be  considered  the best  science fiction /action movie that Hollywood has ever  made.  This is a movie that races beyond almost everyone's imagination and  the majority of people's comprehension.  I have spoken to a number of  non-net savvy people about their thoughts on this movie and most have  indicated that although the action sequences were great, they weren't  really sure what was going on with the plot.For people who understand  the potential impact of the Internet on our society, this movie is  generally considered to be a thought-provoking masterwork.  When HAL was  introduced in 2001, the general public could easily understand the concept  of a computer attempting to invoke human emotion.  The Terminator's concept  of machines displacing/eliminating people was easily understood in the 80's  because people started to lose their jobs to technology.  Decker's moral  conflict on the cold blooded murder of machines challenged the general  public to stretch their imagination towards the potential problems created  by technology.  All three represent relatively easy concepts to  understand.  The Matrix makes these ideas seem like child's play.In  addition to the profound subject matter, the Wachowski brothers demonstrate  an uncanny knack to combine all of the ""hip"" elements of our culture into  one very slick package.  Many of the great visionary director styles are  demonstrated in this super charged flick.  Scenes range from the John Woo's  ""bullets falling from the sky"" and martial arts sequences to David  Fincher's dark and foreboding background shots.  The characters are all  great (Amazingly - Even Keanu Is Good) and the action is relentless.  The  concept of virtual reality plays perfectly to the suspension of disbelief  and this movie soars because of it.  If you want to be challanged by a  thought provoking concept, this is the total package!!"	5.0	Knock Knock HAL, Decker &amp; Neo and The Terminator Are Waiting	1999-10-07	0	0	0

I hadn't read hardly any reviews but had seen the commercials that asked &quot;What is the Matrix.&quot;  So, watching the movie, I was curious.  Then I saw that his wasn't just another average science fiction movie.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2TAPL67U2A5HM	Bjorn Viberg	The Matrix is a 2000 Science fiction film directed by the Wachowski Brothers. At the time the computer graphics were top of the line and now 12 years later they are still quite impressive. The story line is well-developed and like Blade Runner it does bring up questions regarding morals and values. Reeves is surprisingly good in the role of Neo. The music is uneven and sometimes great and sometimes just loud. Still a ground breaking film that was ahead of its time. A very intriguing and thought worthy film that should be seen by science fictions fans and good film fans alike. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.	5.0	The Matrix	2012-02-06	1	1	0

With a little tweaking of the plot it could have been an all time great. I think the problem for me is all the romantic fluff between Neo and Trinity. This compromised the great ideas and transformed the movie into just another box office hit. If the writers/director had some real vision they would have concentrated on the substance of the movie and ditched the cheap romance!

Borrowing ideas from Gnostic and Hellenistic Philosophy, the Wachowski brothers create a tale that will have you pondering your own existence long after the credits have rolled.  This movie is intense.  So intense in fact that it was written ten years before it's release but was put on hold due to the technology needed to produce the film was not created yet.  There are three parts to the Trilogy including Matrix, Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions.  All three were planned before the filming began for the first one and it shows.  Each film is strong in it's own right but together they flow continuously following the adventures of Neo (Keanu Reeves).  What Reeves lacks in emotion and acting quality, Lawrence Fishburne and Carrie-Ann Moss save him, making the film terrific.  Go ahead, take the Red pill.  I would not recommend the anniversary edition as it is somewhat of a letdown unless you're a huge fan of the movie.	4.0	great film but pass up on this edition if you already own the movie	2010-12-27	2	0	2

He will be the one to free the humans from the evil robots.  He didn't just get his special powers; he had to work for it.  You know how you always want main characters to have special powers and be really special?  Well, you get your wish here.  I love the end.  He destroy the bad guys and they were so surprise.  I'm not going to tell you how he did it.  You're just going to have to watch it.  It was sad that a few of the good guys died, but the really important characters did not so don't worry.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3605VVN29N1FM	"Boris Bangemann ""boyse"""	"This is a brilliant film in some ways. It is also a deeply disturbing film in other ways. It is brilliant in the technical execution, the pacing, the atmosphere and tension it creates. It is deeply disturbing in the way it blends religion, violence, reality and fiction.Most of the fascination of this film comes from the American myths it employs to capture the audience. There is the fight for freedom from suppression (what the American Revolution was all about), there is the individual who fights for self-actualization (the self-made man), there is the savior who defeats the empire of evil (the Christian motif), there is romantic love as individual fate (the Hollywood myth). Engrossed as we are, watching these myths unfold in a new story, we do not realize that we enter a matrix of our own making. It is right there in front of us on the screen, or rather, in our heads.""The Matrix"" shows us a world that we are supposed to take for real while we are watching. Without our knowing it, we tend to accept the values and myths promoted by the film. That is no problem as far as quintessentially American myths are concerned. But the film also promotes violence as an attractive and appropriate means for solving problems. And not only that. In my opinion, the film also asks us to believe that a savior has the right to kill in order to liberate other people from their wrong beliefs. The disturbing part about this thought is that radicals of all hues (Muslim radicals, Christian radicals, Hindu radicals, Fascists, Communists, you name them) think the same - ""a savior has the right to kill in order to liberate other people from their wrong beliefs.""Bob Herbert, a columnist in the New York Times, recently wrote an article about violence in America from which I would like to quote a few lines: ""The nation is saturated with violence. Thousands upon thousands of murders are committed each year. There are more than 200 million guns in circulation. Murder is so routine, including the killing of children, it doesn't even warrant serious news coverage in most cases. We don't know what to do about all this violence. We don't know how to process it. We don't even know how to cover it. We sensationalize it, glamorize it, eroticize it. We are fascinated, not by the victims (or by the people with serious ideas about how we might prevent some of this violence) but by the killers.""As much as I admire ""The Matrix"" as a film, I think the message it conveys and the beauty of its slow-motion killing scenes contribute to the problem of violence in America. If anything, this film glamorizes violence. And to top it all, it presents the man who fires bullets so skilfully as a savior in the Christian vein: ""Neo"", the ""new man"", ""The One"", reborn after having been shot dead, rising to the skies to liberate us all."	5.0	Dances with bullets	2002-10-29	0	0	0

Yet, it has one of the smartest plots I have ever seen in a movie, I feel that it is incredibly under rated. It single-handidly brought Keauno Reeves back from the dead, quite an accomplishment ;-). There isn't a single wasted scene, the movie moves at a breakneck pace and still has great character development. The characters react believably, something that isn't seen all that often anymore. The line that Cipher utters:  &quot;I know that this steak isn't real. I know that when i put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my mind that it is delicious and juicy. And after 9 years, you know what i've found out?&quot; he takes a bite, &quot;Ignorance is bliss.&quot;  perfecly illustrates how many people would act, when faced with the choice between one or the other (im trying not to give anything away here), they would choose the Martix.

Everybody has raved about this movie and aside from some of the very good digital  effects, the plot is completely bad and Keanu Reeves is the worst actor  this side of William Shatner. Besides the point the story is a complete rip  off of Grant Morrison's comic book &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, which is  infinitly better than this movie could ever dream to be (this is for you  Grant, buddy). And the ending where he flies off after making the phone  call is so absolutely LAME!  Perhaps Keanu's moves in the movie seems  &quot;Faster than a speeding bullet&quot; thanks to the breakthough of  digital technology, but his acting sure isn't.	1.0	Whoa.....	2000-02-07	11	2	9

0790745399	The Matrix	ABJHCUWVH07GR	Brett	While this is a great movie, the download failed half way through.  We then tried to reorder it but Amazon wouldn't let us order it a second time.  We finally had to download the non-HD version.  While this let us watch the rest of the movie, I ended up with charges for both versions of the movie.  Note: After writing this review I spent forever on the Amazon website trying to figure out how to dispute the charges.  I finally found a way to contact them and, without any problem, they promptly refunded me for the duplicative download.  While I appreciate this, disputing the charge was probably more trouble than it was worth.	1.0	Download Didn't Work	2013-12-29	7	0	7

It's what Blade Runner did for the 80's, Star Wars for the 70's and Space Odessey for the 60's. Another historical step into moviemaking  territory.

0790745399	The Matrix	A13XQ0WP9S3S0I	Brian A. Sanders	When this movie came out it seemed revolutionary in effects and storyline...watching it again at the age of 27 just made me laugh at the bad acting and overall silliness of it all. I can't believe I thought the plot was so complex, but hey I originally saw this when I was 14. So three stars for nostalgia, but if you are not a teenager, you mind bad acting, and don't like cheesy lines you might like it.	3.0	3 for nostalgia	2013-10-29	2	1	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	"`The Matrix' released in '99 is in my opinion one of the most original, entertaining and thought-provoking films in the last 20 years and an undisputed classic in the sci-fi, martial arts, action/adventure genres.I probably should also add the genre of religious films to the list. Initially you'll most likely be overwhelmed by the technological aspects of the film and focus on the computer lingo. However eventually you'll see that it also has a strong spiritual side and realize that is steeped in Eastern mystical philosophy. 'The Matrix' embraces the concept that the world as we experience it is only illusion (Maya) and to be truly free one must strive to break through the bonds that hold us (the Matrix) to the transitory nature of our experience and see things as they really are. What a concept!As is the case with most financially success films, `The Matrix' would spawn two sequels. Though the next two installments of the ""Neo Mythos"" would surpass the original in special effects, neither would come anywhere close to matching the sheer originality, inventiveness, spiritual context and audience interest of the first.The digital shaman has arrived and the revolution is about to begin. The world as we know it is an illusion, take the red pill and WAKE-UP!A must add to your personal DVD library. One of the Essentials."	5.0	"""He Is The One"""	2006-06-26	8	6	2

0790745399	The Matrix	A7U9ZYF780PE9	Brian	After watching this movie in the theaters I was incredibly confused.  I couldn't understand why Keanu came across so believable.  I knew from past films that his acting is bad (borderline atrocious).  Remember Bill &amp;  Ted?  Point Break?  Dangerous Liasons?  Speed?  I can go on.Well.  I  recently came to a revelation.  Keanu played Neo so well because.....  HE  ONLY HAD LIKE 10 LINES IN THE WHOLE MOVIE!But seriously, this  is the best out there in terms  of visual effects, sound, and pure  imagination.  And the DVD has plenty of goodies for all those  &quot;behind-the-scenes-buffs&quot;.  I haven't experienced any glitches in  the DVD.  All smooth and constant picture and sound.  Enjoy.  And for the  next 2 installments, let's pray that Keanu shuts up again!	5.0	I Just Realized Something!	2000-04-29	0	0	0

Although the acting of Reves can sometimes get annoying it has a good story line, I really enjoyed it the first time I saw it. The lobby shooting scene during Morpheus's rescue is what interested me in surround sound. Hearing it now is still good, but doesn't compare to the sound mixing of today's movies. I didn't notice much of a difference in sound between the dvd and bluray.	4.0	Go to the end of your hallway, enter your living room, put this disc in your bluray player.	2014-04-21	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A1HB2YL71ZPJMN	Brian Logue	THe Matrix is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.  Keanu Reeves' acting is horrible, as well as the rest of the cast.  The story has been repeated in over a hundred different movies, the whole &quot;machines have  taken over the world&quot; thing.  Most of the movie is mindless violence  with flahy special affects.  And how am I upposed to feel sympathy for Neo  when the acting is so poor.  I cannot believe the Matrix got such rave  reviews.	1.0	One of the worst movies I have ever seen.	1999-12-15	111	11	100
0790745399	The Matrix	A2IZ05K61BZ8DV	Brian Selzer	This movie is one of the most thought provoking movies I've seen to date. There is an excellent mix of sci-fi and action, and the philosophical concepts woven into the mix only enhance the viewing process. If you have  not already seen this movie, please go out and see it; it's fantastic. The  movie explodes into action in the first scene and continues forward, never  letting up until the end. Even if your favorite stars are not in this film,  it is a must see! The co-directors do a great job of controlling the  special effects so that they do not take over the film. They also sculpt  the scenes in such a way that, by the end of the movie, the viewer can't  help but be immersed in the story. Again, this is a must see film, I highly  reccomend it!	5.0	Superb!	1999-12-10	19	17	2

This movie would be very good even without the great plot because of it's  original action shots.  The slow motion shots of Neo and the Agent during  the fight scene in the subway terminal are the best I've ever seen.  The  plot makes you think about your reality, and whether or not what you think  is real really is.  This is a film that you must see.	5.0	Alter World Masterpiece	2000-04-11	1	1	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A1HG2DOSBZEX4I	Bryan A. Pfleeger	With almost 3000 reviews out there nothing more needs to be said on the plot of this film. Therefore I will limit my review to the contents of the DVD that I viewed.The DVd contains an arsenal of special features some betteer than others. In addition to the film we get two feature length commentaries. The first is by the special effects designer and the editor with additional comments by Carrie Anne Moss. This is standard fare commentary with lots of dead time as the film runs. The two crew members discuss the concept and have a rather lengthy discussion on &quot;bullet time.&quot; The discussion is rather complicated but interesting nevertheless. Ms. Moss chimes in rarely to discuss scenes in which she was a principal.The second commentary is more interesting. This is a music only track with commentary by composer Don Davis. He discusses the score and its creation and integration with other non-source material. It is interesting to watch the film in this fashion as one does not always get a sense of the great deal of music involved in the film.The usual making of special is included and runs around 26 minutes. This is a better than average production special and is well worth a look. Also included are two &quot;hidden&quot; featurettes  called &quot;What is the Concept&quot; containing original conceptual drawings and &quot;What is Bullet Time&quot; containing a deeper discussion of the special effects created using the virtual camera system designed for the film.&quot;Follow the White Rabbit&quot; allows the viewer to see an extended version of the film with nine production featurettes included that deal with the creation of the special effects and fight sequences.All in all this is a very well made DVD which serves to enhance the viewing experience of a film that is rapidly becoming a classic.	3.0	Great Sci-Fi Action Adventure	2003-10-27	1	0	1

Is the idea of illusionary reality a new thing? For fans of the Matrix it may be. Go read some books and find out how watered down this movie really is. I hated it all the more due to its tedious marketing and hub-bub. Tron had Jeff Bridges, the Matrix has dumb-face. Tron had GOOD computer special effects that were unlike anything seen before. Matrix has off the shelf effects that we've seen before in about a thousand video games. Is this a film or a video game intro? A bunch of worhtless garbage.

0790745399	The Matrix	A227E26SPZO7A1	Caesar J. Cabalfin	Simply put: I love this movie.  With &quot;The Matrix&quot;, the Wachowski brothers have crossed stunning visuals with an imaginative and intelligent plot.  Clearly, they are influenced by John Woo, Jackie Chan, George Lucas as well as several graphic novel artists.  Each scene in the movie is framed like a cell from a comic book.  They even managed to make Keanu Reeves seem tough! Without a doubt, this is still my favorite movie from the last three years.  This DVD is excellent.  Warner Bros took full advantage of the 5.1 Dolby Digital format and you can hear the results with every playback.  There are a lot of extras including a &quot;Making of&quot; and interviews with the cast and directors.  I cannot wait to see the rest of the Matrix trilogy.

This is the concept of &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  Don't be fooled by the start, this movie gets very good.  This is one of my favorite sci-fi movies, up there with &quot;Minority Report&quot;.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3L24N0HVNXAJO	Captain Zones	"This was a great movie. Yeah, it has plot holes, but as you can see from the legions of fans, almost nobody noticed them. (In case you're one of those and your head just blew up: we blocked out the sun and the robots never thought of the vast energy resources of nuclear power? Instead, they used humans for power, even though it was obviously inconvenient to them, and even though the heat we give off as waste consumes more energy than it provides... obviously. We're energy CONSUMING creatures). The action is top notch and very innovative. The special effects was one of the most copied in decades. Too bad the W-brothers didn't have anything left. The sequels were pretty embarrassing, each worse than the last. I've seen several people comparing Star Wars unfavorably to the Matrix. Really, though, if you think about the Matrix, it ought to give you MORE respect for Lucas. It's not easy to sustain a storyline. The W-brothers couldn't do it past #1. Lucas has done six plus cartoons. He no longer adheres to the ""immaculate reality"" so stringently as he did in the beginning, but they're still good films (none of the six being worse than M3 Revolutions). It does bother me that so few people credit William Gibson with having been the father of the genre. If you'd ever read his cyberpunk works, you'd understand that Matrix isn't quite as innovative as you think (but then, he wasn't able to translate his edgy writing style into film, so oh well). As anyone who has seen Matrix knows, though, these are minor criticisms. Matrix was a great film. Watch it."	4.0	Great movie. Too bad they couldn't sustain it...	2009-04-18	10	3	7

0790745399	The Matrix	A2GLN2XGQ5JNWQ	Carol Abbott	I view movies primarily to be entertained.  The Matrix is packed with action and visual effects that had me gasping.There are four truly outstanding, memorable performances by the actors:  Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is erie and casts just the right tone of a man who has seen it all.  Carrie-Anne Moss is so right for the part of Trinity.  Hugo Weaving takes evil to a whole new level as the dead-pan Agent Smith.  And Gloria Foster as the Oracle steals the scene with that little twinkle and the cookies.The details of the plot are only as complicated as they need to be to frame the story and allow for the action to take place.  Because, in the end, THAT is what drives the movie forward.  The viewer is invited along for the ride.  And what a Fun House ride it is!!From the opening sequence where Trinity is trapped by local police, then runs (over rooftops), leaps through air for a flight-long tumble down steps and finally dashes into a phone booth about to be smashed by a huge trash truck, this viewer was left breathless and in awe of the power of this scene.  Why is she being chased?  What crime has she committed?  Who are the guys in the dark glasses and black suits?After this, the action never really stops.  Gradually, we are given answers to the Why, What and Who as Keanu Reeves is recruited into an organization dedicated to giving the earth back to it's human batteries.Sure, it's an outlandish plot, but I'm looking for entertainment in this movie, not great literature.  It's a fun movie and one that I have watched more than once.  So it was a good choice to add to our DVD collection.	5.0	This movie is FUN!	2002-08-06	2	2	0

The Film 'The Matrix', however, is the exception to my usual sci-fi blues.  It is intelligently written and, more importantly, the storyline is maintained throughout the entire movie.  The special effects are intensely captivating and are, to say the least, stunningly performed.  Everytime I watch it, I find another aspect of the film to enjoy.  It is, in my opinion, one the most superior sci-fi films to date.	5.0	Finally, A Sci-fi Movie that doesn't drop the ball.	2001-05-08	2	1	1

The biggest upset was seeing a noticeable difference between the basic DVD and the Blu-Ray version. Neither the sound or video made me go ""Wow, what a difference"".

0790745399	The Matrix	A15FZCDCIQTW22	C. 'Chevy' Pickup	Own the movie that changed the world! You ask, why on earth would anyone buy a movie that is over 10 years old? Because it is still relevant? Because it has cutting edge special effects which aren&#8217;t only there to dazzle, but actually adds to the story narrative? Perhaps because it is a story that parallels your own life in some way? Buy it as a tutorial, because it explains complex esoteric truths in so simple a way, that even a child can understand? What if I told you, that the imbedded information of this story works to awaken your consciousness? That the arch types represented, are age old place holders which loosen the wheels and cogs of your mind and cause a quantum overload, breaking through the illusion, to expose the truth? What if I told you, that you are the One? You are Neo, and this is your personal map to awakening.All good esoteric training material is written in story, look how Jesus taught. He told relatable stories to illustrate the truth he was presenting. So did Buddha. Both were speaking to a mostly uneducated population. Just about every spiritual adept, who has walked the face of the earth, taught through story. This still works. The Celestine Prophesy is a modern day kickstart of a spiritual movement, told as an action adventure, but revealing new spiritual ideals along the way. When 'The Matrix' came out at the edge of a new age, the age of Aquarius, people were searching. They were hungry for answers, just as Neo is at the beginning, searching for the illusive Matrix. Lives were empty, so was his. Work did not provide the answer, relationships did not provide the answer. Religion provided a narrow view point that did not make sense to anyone with more than a 3rd grade education. We were leaving behind the Piscean age of dreaming and illusion, the time of the dying God, and embracing the rebellious and humanitarian age of Aquarius. This movie marries the Christ myth and the Buddhist philosophy into one narrative.An important consideration to keep in mind, which is not known by the general population, but important for understanding this movie and it&#8217;s cosmic message , is that Christianity is not a pure religion. Little history lesson. When the Emperor Constantine of Rome had a city which was half pagan, and half the followers of Jesus, who adhered to a belief called &#8216;the way,&#8217; he needed a simple solution so that Rome wouldn&#8217;t be engulfed in civil strife, and he could remain in power. At the Council of Nicaea, Constantine gathered the holy fathers of both religions and forced them to create a hybrid of the two. This is where the concept of original sin comes in, Jesus never speaks of original sin, if it was an important foundational belief, he would have. The pagan staple, the dying God, a hang over from the sun worshipers whose God dies every sunset to rise again the next day, is established as the true reason behind Jesus&#8217; mission. Sacrifice is a huge theme in pagan mythology and it becomes the core of the Christian belief system even though it&#8217;s founder never focuses on it, his focus was actually universal love.Now we have the crux of the story. Each of us must show our &#8216;sacred face,&#8217; our sacrifice for others, as we face off the antithesis of our awakened selves; our shadow side, the &#8216;antichrist&#8217; as portrayed by Agent Smith. To follow the convoluted path of the One, it helps to have more than a child&#8217;s understanding of the teachings of Jesus. Christ is not the name of a person, it is the name for the connection between an individual and the Divine. To be in Christ Consciousness is to be connected directly to the Divine. The antichrist is again not an individual, but the ego, our shadow selves. The ego is that state where you are not Divinely connected, rather you are seeking gratification of self. Neo and Agent Smith are actually one, which is played out in the next two installments of the Matrix trilogy. The Divinely connected human, battles the ego for control. The Ego wants to rule the world but the soul desires connection, a true communion with the Divine. In order to do this, Neo must wrestle with Agent Smith, overcome the ego, the shadow, by becoming one with it, and step into his power of divinely connected human, transcending all illusion.So what has this got to do with you? Everything. True power is not outside of you. Neo illustrates this when he begins to master The Matrix. Stepping back from the illusion, seeing it as a canvas which allows you to create upon it by harnessing your mind, making the mind work for you, rather than allowing the ego to run you with fear dramas. This is the key to enlightenment. At the beginning of the movie we are invited along for the journey of the Christ myth when Neo is told, &#8220;you&#8217;re my savior man, my own personal Jesus Christ.&#8217; We are told at the start to look through the metaphor, it is all laid out for us plainly. Dreams speak in metaphor, the language of the unconscious, and it is from the unconscious that we must awaken to be present to our own Matrix.Even the names used for the characters are code to engage the enlightened seeker. Morpheus, the God of dreams, is one of your greatest teachers. In dream time many puzzles are solved, many illusions are explained. This is a really powerful name for a powerful player in this story, because the entire point of The Matrix is to awaken from it. It is Morpheus who tells Neo, &#8220;you have been living in a dream world Neo.&#8221; We are also told that without Morpheus there is no resistance, everything rests on him. Trinity who represents the Divine Feminine, is there to support you, messages from Heaven appear in threes so you know it was Divinely inspired. Cipher, representing the media, will try to lead you astray with false truths because it is there helping Agent Smith, the ego. Cipher pretends to be on your side to inform you, but is actually planning your demise by engaging you in mental games and enhancing the need to gratify the ego. Epoch reminds us that this is a significant story of historical value being retold. Switch tells us that we are going to get turned on, we are going to see the light. The Oracle is a living person, not an ancient prophesy. She is a part of The Matrix, living in both worlds. She is personable, kind, she bakes cookies, she is someone you can interact with and talk with. She is surrounded by children who are gifted adepts, able to manipulate The Matrix at will. She gives each person a key to the puzzle, which in the end, all fit together. She is approachable and speaks plainly even though she is revered by others. Zion, literally God&#8217;s house, is where the treasure is, all that is left of humanity, the true wealth of this world, and the only safe place left. The Nebuchadnezzar, the ship Morpheus pilots, is named after a King of Babylon, who destroyed Jerusalem and exiled the Jewish people to Babylon. All these names are significant. By invoking ancient mythological names which act as trigger words, the mind is engaged on a spiritual pursuit long after you have seen this movie.So why all the guns? The temper of our times. Guns and bullets, the great equalizing balance between the powerful and the weak, as long as both sides are well armed. People who live with fear need guns, and the ego deals in fear. So Neo, with the help of Trinity (the Divine) (women are usually so much more connected spiritually than men)  flies to the aid of his mentor to free him, thus creating the crisis which allows Neo to step into his power. Neo goes after Morpheus to rescue his mentor but what Neo is actually doing is to go into sleep, into the illusion, to rescue himself.Crisis is often times, the invitation to transform. Running away from one event, we run towards the very thing which holds our redemption. Whatever you run away from, you will run into. This is what Neo does, he runs right into the confrontation with Smith, there he goes beyond time and space to emerge as master of both his ego and The Matrix. It isn&#8217;t until Neo stops fighting Agent Smith that he calmly says, &#8216;no,&#8217; then becomes one with his shadow self, accepting his power. This movie is a map to self transformation, if you know how to recognize and understand the symbolism. This is the underlying goal of the movie, to awaken people who are just going through the motions of their life, to a level of mastery where they are co-creators of their own reality. Watch it more than once with this in mind in order to appreciate the subtle nuances, which support all of us in becoming capable of shifting our reality. This is really a movie of the new age, heralding limitless possibilities, where we are the creators of our own worlds.	5.0	The Christ Myth Meets Buddhism	2013-11-29	6	3	3
0790745399	The Matrix	A35IYKFDG1LUZ3	"CD Harris ""Amuk"""	Hands down, this was the best sf film of 1999. Even the presence of the artless Keanu Reeves works - there are few actors who could more genuinely express Neo's confusion and sense of being out-of-place than Reeves  (perhaps b/c he isn't acting). The superb Agent Smith should have been a  shoe-in for a Supporting Actor nomination - and doubtless would have been  had this not been an sf film. Possessing a truly original plot and splendid  visuals, this film was one of the few must-see films of the year - and one  of only two I gladly paid theater prices to see multiple times on the big  screen.This widescreen release on video more than does justice to the  big screen experience - though it will likely make anyone with a less than  wall-sized TV think seriously of upgrading. Those with DVD players will  doubtless only consider purchasing this movie in that format - and rightly  so - but if you're stuck, as I am, with only a VCR, get this widescreen  version! Being driven as it is by its visuals and luscious special effects,  you don't want the inevitable losses that come with conversion to  pan-and-scan, no matter what size your TV screen is.To sum up, this is a  great film and the conversion to video is terrific.

I got the 10th Anniversary Edition.  The case is basically a Blu-ray sized book with a slot in the back for the blu-ray disk.  It has about 40 pages of text and pictures of/about the movie, the actors, directors, etc.  I never pay extra for special editions, but I really liked this one.  It was a landmark movie, and I enjoy having this memento of it.  There is only one disk, but as it is blu-ray, it has the extras on it.  I do recommend this version of the movie, but don't expect Blu-ray picture quality.	3.0	Blu-ray No Better Than DVD	2010-05-20	3	1	2

The &quot;Bullet Time Photography&quot;  has  never been used before, but I am sure will be used a ton of times in future  movies.

What more could you want? I am so disappointed that the DVD didn't have some more features. I thought DVDs were so cool because everyone always talked about getting deleted scenes and alternate endings, and this had none of that. I love deleted scenes, bloopers and alternate endings.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2FS38D943KX12	chefdevergue	As we fast approach the release of &quot;Matrix: Revolutions&quot; I find myself amazed at the cult-like following this series has attracted, as though this film contains amazing universal truths previously undiscovered by our benighted species.  People rave about these movies as though Neo &amp; the gang have ushered them into the intellectual-spiritual light of day.What a load of hooey.  Not only has the artificial reality concept been done before (and done to death, mind you) in the science fiction genre, but the concept that life is only a dream has been explored by philosophers, to a depth much more thorough than this film could ever hope to go.In and of itself, being imitative &amp; derivative is hardly a offense unique to &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  However, this movie compounds its crime by exuding a self-importance that is truly nauseating at times.  If the Wachowski brothers truly believe that they are imparting some great existential revelations through this movie, it is only because they have spent too much time reading comic books and not enough time reading the numerous philosophers who have covered this ground many times before.  The same can be said, incidentally, for the numerous movie viewers who found themselves blown away by this film's content.The self-importance of this movie reminds me of the comic-book geek subculture that insists that comic books be called &quot;graphic novels.&quot;  Given the Wachowski brothers' background in the comic book industry, this should hardly be surprising.  Sorry folks, but a graphic novel is still just a goddamned comic book with some fancy packaging, and &quot;The Matrix&quot; is just a goddamned kung-fu shoot-em-up movie with a lot of special effects thrown in to distract you from that.And my goodness, does this movie ever revel in its special effects, to the point of almost drowning the audience in them.  One has to suspect a movie that resorts to special effects to such an excessive degree is perhaps trying to obscure a storyline that is a bit too weak &amp; derivative.Once you take away all the bells &amp; whistles, what you are left with is a not particularly original or thought-provoking movie that would like you to believe that it is much more deep &amp; important than it truly is.  Talk about an artificially-induced reality!  This movie self-fulfills its own prophecies more than the Wachowskis ever could have realized.	1.0	Over-Rated, Self-Indulgent, Over-Hyped &amp; Self-Important	2003-11-04	95	37	58

0790745399	The Matrix	A25TDEGIPHZTZS	"chris banez lim ""Crutchead"""	For a fiction to work out well- it would have to be proportionally realistic with its plot's structure. This movie fails to level that way with its story. For a try-hard sci-fi flick that tried hard to carry its plot with a bunch of far fetch scientifical explanations, still it was never able to resist on going its way to incorporate the element of fantasy to its story- in this case dealing with prophetical predicaments within its storyline surprisingly, that it doesn't fit well with its already preposterous script, which borrows heavily from the doctrines of Buddhist teachings - giving a ridiculous effect in the result ; and as if it weren't enough, they also borrowed heavily from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs!Filled with bad acting and bad action choreography sequences- sure this movie may have some great overbloated special fx, but they are even all blown out of proportion at times, unnecessarily with its scenes perhaps except only for the purpose of showing off. Just recently last week i've watched X-MEN 2 on the cinema, and among the most previous films to have come out it's such that is a well made enough film to use impressive and inane type of 90's fx married well with its scenes coherent to the storyline, unlike this cacophony hogwash of a movie. If you're looking for science fiction with solid plot structure, go for them classic 70's sci-fi's like SOYLENT GREEN and The OMEGA MAN (both starring Charlton Heston) + the original PLANET OF THE APES (w/c still stands well with its satirical social commentary, unlike its remake which is completely washed out of any substance from the original siries, and is nothing but a deliberately commercialized attempt to cash in with the dime-a-dozen sci-fi movies of the past few years (quite a mojor disappointment considering that it's a film by Tim Burton)), and the Stanley Kubrick film epic of Arthur C. Clarke's 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY. And for a sci-fi flick that goes well of its mixture with fantasy elements-- no one could go wrong with George Lucas' classic trilogy of the original STAR WARS, for the most familliar so to speak...I'm a major fan of the sci-fi/fantasy genre myself, but for me this pretensious hack goes down to the gutter with the now forgotten fad of the X-FILES...I wouldn't nary give a hoot about its couple of sequels now showing in the cinemas.

It has something for everyone. As for extras, this one is a bit light compared to the Electronic Press Kits that are standard fare these days, but this DVD was released at a time where DVD's weren't that popular and were still outsold by VHS. In fact I think I remember reading somewhere that this is the first DVD to sell over a million units!I think a director's commentary would have been a great tool to help get around the philosophy of the film instead we have the effects guy and Bulletime(TM) creator John Gadea and Joel Silver and Carrie Ann Moss providing some insight but it's intermittent and can really be distracting sometimes	5.0	Ying, Yang and Bang Bang	2003-07-08	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A1O294P80YCP81	"""christianskeptic"""	Very rarely have I watched a movie that was both exciting and intellectually stimulating.  Most flicks put all the action on the surface.  The Matrix layers the action over a plot with deeper philosophical  implications:  What is reality?  Is the physical world, as I know it, all  that there is?  Am I in control of my life, or am I under the control of  something above and beyond me?  Is this greater power good or evil?  The  film borrows heavily from a syncretic mix of world reglions, most notably  Buddhism and Christianity.  But the overarching themes of the film are  definitely Christian.  But beyond this, the film is a technical  masterpiece.  The visual effects are stunning.  In fifty years time, I  think the Matrix will be looked upon as one of those seminal works that  changed the way movies are made.	5.0	Sci-fi with brains (mmmm, brains)	2000-04-04	5	4	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A2F9AGLWLR7PFN	christine	The Matrix defies all barriers in cinematic moviemaking. I'm not saying that the acting is simply superb and is Oscar worthy but the special effects are what all the buzz is about. The directors Larry and Andy Wachowski skillfully use the infamous &quot;bullet time.&quot; That's when a bullet is shot, time seems to be frozen in individual frames, giving the person being shot at a whole lot of time to dodge bullets. Also, when every karate move is shot, they are made into a piece of art.The film is about &quot;the Matrix&quot; a computer generated fantasy that our regular world is living in. I don't know if this has any spiritual meaning. A computer hacker junky (Keanu Reeves) is given the opportunity to look at the thing he's been searching for forever the real world. One day, he finds a message on his computer. It says to follow the white rabbit. He does, following a girl with a tattoo, to a club. There he meets Trinity (brilliantly played by Carrie Anne Moss) a girl who will tell &quot;Mr. Anderson&quot; the secrets of the Matrix. One event leads into another. Now, &quot;Mr. Anderson&quot; is Neo of a group of sort of rebels trying to outwit the agents. The agents are a group of three, part of an alien race who took over the Earth a long time ago. Agent Smith, in particular, seems the most bloodthirsty and has a taste for vengeance. The band of rebels include Morpheous, the wise leader and father figure. Then there's Mouse, Cypher, Tank, Dozer, and two others, whose names I seemed to have forgotten. Their mission is to try and show others the real world. Not the Matrix but the world from real eyes. The Matrix II: Reloaded is the sequel. Be prepared for an eye dazzler.	5.0	Matrix Is An Innovative Cinematic Masterpiece	2001-08-31	2	0	2

The widescreen isnt that small, so you can actually see the movie.  The special features in the movie are ok which include follow the white rabbit.  Follow the White Rabbit comes up at the bottom of the screen, you press enter, and they will show you how they shot that scene.  I like this special feature the best.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2X8KN82L07RSK	C. Johnson	Now that all 3 movies in the Trilogy are out. I will review each one.This Matrix is the first installment in the Matrix trilogy.  It focuses on Thomas Anderson aka NEO.  Neo is a software developer by day, computer hacker by night. He knows that there is something wrong with the world but can't quite figure out what it is.  When he meets Morpheus he decides he wants to know what the Matrix really is.  After Neo finds out he does not believe his eyes. Towards the middle of the movie, NEO finally comes to grips that the Matrix is just a computer program that humans are plugged into while the machines live off of them.  After knowing this NEO slowly discovers that he can do superhuman things while in the Matrix because the Matrix world is not &quot;real&quot;.Many of you already seen the movie so there is no need for me to go into much more detail about the plot.  But I will say that this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time.  After figuring out what the Matrix really was, I was blown away by the original storyline, and I began to think to myself &quot;what if the world I'm living in is like the Matrix?&quot;  I have seen this movie at least 20 times, and I never get tired of it.  The speical effects and fighting scenes are nothing short of spectatcular.  This is a must have title for your collection.  I can't believe anyone would give this movie anything less than 4 stars.  Its not your average movie and it does require some thinking to see what is actually going on.  If one does not really understand the storyline, then they will write this movie off as another action flick when in reality this movie goes so much deeper.  5 stars in my book!	5.0	One of the best/original movies I have seen in a long time!	2004-04-15	4	3	1

If you haven't seen it, there are any number of glowing reviews on this page to interest you, but I'm speaking to those people who already like this movie and are  debating whether to get the dvd.Get it.The visuals are unbelievably  crisp and the sound is very very good. But the extras alone would be worth  buying the dvd for. You finally get to see how they do that incredible  freeze-frame surround effect, and they also show the actors learning  martial arts. Yes, that's really Lawrence Fishburne and Keanu Reeves  fighting... they spent 5 months learning how!As you can see, I really  enjoy this dvd. If you liked the movie, I'm sure you will, too.

0790745399	The Matrix	ATOS750XCC9MQ	Classis Genre Film Fanatic	When I first saw this movie, it took me by surprise - as well as thousands of other people. It came out at a &quot;non-blockbuster&quot; season (March '99), and just dominated all.This movie is the best of the trilogy because it can stand on its own, and makes sense after watching it. The last two, while really cool, take a few more viewings as well as a few searches on the internet to really make sense of the plot. They offer harldy any understandable explanation to what's going on. This first one was made to stand on its own, and it shows. The plot is confusing at first, but later makes total sense.The concept of The Matrix isn't really anything new, but the way it was done was amazing and made you think.

It boasts stars like Samuel L Jackson and Keanu Reeves, who has, I  think revived his flagging movie career with this movie. The Matrix also  sets the scene for those who are fashion conscious. The very slick costumes  and sunglasses add to the very cool, futuristic feel of the film. The dark  feel of the film, which comes through in the characters and their costumes  are continued in the awesome sountrack that accompanies the movie. (fans of  Manson and Rammstein will love the music). All in all, I found The Matrix  to be a very polished, thought provoking movie about our present and future  society and the &quot;Big Brother&quot; complex that we seem to have in  this technological age.	5.0	matriXiting	2000-07-17	0	0	0

This movie had fighting yes and it was used at apporpiate times unlike the second movie the fighting was bit of a overkill. I am not sayin that Matrix reloaded is not a bad movie, but it could've had a more in depth plot. This movie contains a great story line and great actors.This movie is rated R for violence and language. I would have given it a rating of PG-13, but I thought that it's rating was appropiate because of kids that are very violent prone. Overall it is a PG-13 movie but you want to keep your little kids (10 and younger) away from it so that they wont be copying stunts and tricks that will provoke them to violent acts.

Nobody ever said the matrix was a dialogue filled intellectual feast. However, for anyone who is a fan of  great filmaking, this movie is a must see. the matrix contains some of the  greatest camerawork, cinematography, and audacious angles in movie history.  The experience is made even better on DVD with the digital quality picture  and sound, and the huge array of features only on the DVD. Especially cool  is the running commentary from those who made the film in one feature, and  the inclusion of the &quot;making of&quot; documentary.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1MYCAU03U8J38	Collin Anderson	I have only one complaint for this movie. Keanu Reeves, Trinity and Tank have some pretty weak moments. That being said, I shall now give everything else about this movie (these qualities being so super a numerous that there is no question that it is five stars).This movie will blow your mind. The special effects are more revolutionary than Star Wars, the action is suberb, most of the acting rocks, and the plot is spectacular. The plot, which I consider to be one of the most important aspects of a movie, is great because you can see both sides. I despise a movie in which the &quot;bad guy&quot; is completely evil without any cause. This movie shows that some people's personalities can be too weak to accept what is hard to believe, and to drive themselves back into their ignorant naive state, they would do anything. That sums up why this movie is so great. You can see the point of view of all sides, and the whole thing is enhanced by everything else in the movie.Of course, I am not alone with my 5 stars. There are thousands of other reasons to buy this movie, that I won't bore you with. Because no one can be told what the Matrix is... you have to see it for yourself.	5.0	Unfortunately, no one can be TOLD what the Matrix is...	2001-08-02	2	1	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A3DTUMLBZCG47D	Connor J. Hamilton	The Matrix was the most popular R-rated film when it came out in the theaters, and it has reason to be so. Obviously the most stand-out feature of this film is the special effects, which are flaunted from stem to stern. Awesome jumps over highways, lengthy shoot-outs in pillared rooms, and martial arts combat with a sentient program, this film has it all.Keanu Reeves as Thomas A. Anderson AKA Neo is in his element in this film, and he comes off very well with his sunglasses and ankle-length leather jacket concealing a veritable arsenal of rapid-fire weaponry. Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity gives a good screen presence, and pulls off a tough-tender mix in her character--there is a vast difference between her ferocious karate chops at the beginning of the film and her loving words to Neo close to the end. Laurence Fishburne is very good as Morpheus, even though he is in manacles for a good part of the film.Then there is Hugo Weaving. This masterful actor can convulse the audience with his drawn-out speech and delliberate movements, or he can have them pitying and encouraging Neo as he hurls the good guy into walls and pummels him with super fast fists.The Wachowski brothers, the directors and writers of the film, handle it well with good camera angles and a fine screenplay.For those searching for thrills and a heavy slant toward visual effects, this is a good movie to look into.	5.0	A Stunning Visual Spectacle	2003-07-06	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	"WARNING: This review contains spoilers! DO NOT READ THIS UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!Every once in a great while a film comes along that changes everything and revolutionizes the way films are made. It happened with Fritz Lang's Metropolis, Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Steven Spielberg's Jaws, and George Lucas' Star Wars... now we are given Andy and Larry Wachowski's The Matrix. The Matrix not only has a cool, cyberpunk, hyper stylized look and jaw-dropping special effects, it also features an intelligent story that is often overlooked by the mindless action junkies. The story unfolds at a feverish pace while we, the viewers, are given the thrill ride of a lifetime.Thomas Anderson worked a menial desk job at a major software company. In his spare time he leads a double life as Neo, a computer hacker, and it is as Neo that he gained the attention of some very strange people. One night, after falling asleep in front of his computer, Neo wakes up to find a message flashing on the monitor. ""Wake up, Neo... The Matrix has you... Follow the white rabbit. Knock, knock."" Not two seconds after reading this message, the door knocks. It's only one of Neo's friends stopping by to pick up a disc, or is it? Neo notices that his friend's girlfriend has a tattoo of a white rabbit on her shoulder, so naturally when he's invited to go to a rave he agrees out of curiosity. Once there, Neo is overwhelmed by the blaring rock music, the flashing strobe lights, and he's just considering leaving when a beautiful woman dressed in a slinky black outfit approaches him. She introduces herself as Trinity, a name that Neo is already familiar with. She's an expert hacker and an ally to Morpheus, a mysterious man that the authorities are after. Trinity tells Neo that he's in danger, that she understands him and his growing feeling of disenchantment, that she can help him, and that Morpheus can answer the question that's been eating away at his subconscious: What is the matrix?The next morning Neo wakes up and realizes that he's late for work. When he arrives there his boss lectures him saying, ""You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson. You believe that you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you. Obviously, you are mistaken."" After his reprimand his day only gets worse. He receives a FedEx package containing a cellular phone, which immediately begins to ring. When he answers it he hears, for the first time, the voice of Morpheus. ""I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately you and I have run out of time. They're coming for you and I don't know what they're going to do."" Over the phone Morpheus gives Neo instructions to on how to escape the building without being seen, but Neo fails to follow these instructions. He's taken into the custody of several strange agents, who interrogate him and plant him with a ""bug"".Neo wakes up the next day believing that all the events of the previous day had been a dream, until he gets a phone call from Morpheus who cryptically tells Neo that he is ""The One"". They agree to meet at a safe location. When Trinity picks up Neo, she asks him to lift his shirt because she thinks he may be ""bugged"". Trinity reveals a large, awkward, high tech contraption that she uses to locate and remove the ""bug"". She then takes Neo to an old deserted building where he finally meets Morpheus face to face. Morpheus asks Neo if he wants to know the truth about the Matrix. He explains that no one can be told what the Matrix is, that they have to see it for themselves. Morpheus produces two pills and then offers Neo a choice: Take the blue pill and his life will return to normal, but if he takes the red pill Morpheus will reveal to him the mystery of the Matrix. Neo, with a little hesitation, takes the red pill and his world begins to dissolve, literally. The next thing he knows is that he's naked, covered with cords and wires that are plugged into his body, and that the vat of amniotic fluid he's been sleeping in is suddenly drained away, pulling him down through a series of tunnels and depositing him in a lake of waste. A large airship comes to his rescue and removes him from the grimy water. When Neo reawakens, Morpheus tells him that his entire world, his entire existence was fabricated, that he had been subjugated by an illusory reality designed to keep him compliant. The real world turns out to be a nightmare and the nightmare a reality. In the real world, the machines have long ago developed artificial intelligence, and taken over the surface of the planet as they use human beings as their energy source. The Matrix, as it turns out, is nothing more than an elaborate set of programs meant to deceive human beings so that the machines may parasitically feed off their semi-conscious bodies. Neo's life has been an empty dream world... but there is hope.Morpheus has been leading a band of freedom fighters who live in the real world and hack into the Matrix through a pirate signal, to free humanity from the clutches of the machines. Morpheus tells Neo of a techno-mystical prophecy that one day a man will be born who will liberate humankind and end the war between the living and the mechanical. Morpheus trains Neo to become their champion in a virtual reality simulator, where Neo learns martial arts. He is also taught how to adapt his mind so that when he next enters the Matrix, he will be able to fortify himself for protection as well as bypass the laws of physics (mainly gravity). But they also face great obstacles, both in and out of the Matrix. In the real world they must deal with Sentinels, robots that are squid like in appearance and armed with a deadly arsenal. Within the Matrix, there's the threat of the Agents who eliminate any dissenters. Of these Agents, Agent Smith is the most dangerous for his programming was flawed. He is capable of experiencing human emotions such as ambition, pride, and a general contempt for all organic living things. Soon Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity have begun a revolution from which there can be no turning back. They will either end the tyranny of the machines or be crushed in the attempt.The concept that our perceived reality is a mere illusion is by no means revolutionary. Since ancient times, philosophers and scientists have suggested the possibility of alternate realities which are only accessible through the mind. What makes The Matrix so fascinating is that it combined this metaphysical idea with modern technology, contemporary politics, social counterculture, and martial arts action. The film also has an underlying spirituality and frequently makes references to world religions and mythologies. The iconic characters are played to perfection by a talented cast including Keanu Reeves as Neo, Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity, Joe Pantoliano as Cypher, and Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. Though it was released in 1999, The Matrix has often been cited as the film that ushered in the new millennium. It is a high energy, thought provoking modern masterpiece.Also recommended:Philip K.

I am not a particular fan of the film, especially the sequels, so I say these remarks with no bias. I just rented this first ""Matrix"" to see how it looked. Well, it Blu (pun intended) me away!!  At this point, I've seen around 50 Blu-Ray DVDs and this is as good as it gets. I can't imagine how you could make it any better.  It's so sharp, I just sat there mesmerized by it. The sound also is outstanding....another upgrade. I've seen this movie three times now and I swear I heard a lot of background talk and stuff I never heard before.So....if you read that the audio and visuals are 5-star caliber - believe it; it's true."	5.0	Blu-Ray Transfer Is Fantastic!	2009-03-06	159	150	9

0790745399	The Matrix	ASNE6WU6V6P2N	Craig Larson	"_The Matrix_ is a film that measures up favorably to such other classic science fiction films as _Blade Runner_, _12 Monkeys_, _Aliens_, and the Terminator films. In fact, I wouldn't at all be surprised if this becomes the _Blade Runner_ of the 90s (in reference to the incredible influence that film had on the look of films which followed).It's hard to believe that the creators of _Bound_, which was an enjoyable, though forgettable film, could have such an incredible second act waiting. I love this film--not since _Brazil_ have I seen a film worth watching multiple times while it was still in theaters. And the DVD presentation lives up to the film--this is one of those DVD's you want on hand to show your friends what the format is capable of, a ""show-off"" disc.I give the film my highest possible recommendation; it lives up to repeated viewings, has a great soundtrack, and the FX are truly groundbreaking.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1N59LOPQFE6BU	crc@isa.dknet.dk	After having seen Matrix, I felt spiritually relieved, satisfied with life, strong and compelled to do good to all living beings.I started getting religious insights watching this movie, and after having seen it 5  times in movie theatres, I truly feel the deeper meaning of (true)  christianity and humanity, my look at the world and religion has lighted up  and given me reason to hope and live!But why?? This movie seems to be  pure violence and technical disaster on the surface!?I figured that it  might be that the final message of Matrix is that good overcomes evil, love  instills life in the seemingly dead, that helping and fighting for God will  succeed in the end.The comparative message of Star Wars 1 (not 4,5,6)  is that evil tricks you, gambling is nessesary and helpful, innocent  children are doomed to betray their fathers and that even though you fight,  you will lose and the Dark Lord takes over control of the universe.When  I look upon the characters in Matrix as biblical - and pardon me for  eventual blasphemy - the Holy Script was revealed before me! (which I  eventually have never bothered to read before...)Neo, the Man, the  prophesized (!) return of Jesus turned into Christ, come to redeem the  world and overthrow the dark.Trinity, the Holy Spirit, love, the mother,  notice how the movie does not mention sex at all - she can thus be seen as  virgin Mary, dressed according to the likes of the target audience, but  inwardly saintly, her name pointing towards the wholy trinity of God,  Christ and the Holy Spirit. She has always full trust in Neo and gives him  food where none other does.Morpheos, in appearance cloaked as a human,  does not break, only seemingly - as a means to awaken Neo and others, a  gentle and compassionate God, giving humans the offer of using their free  will in the choice of waking up to Him! Notice how the agents cannot break  His mind, but then shifts to make Him use His compassion for even these  dark beings. They try to make Him say the Word that will undo the  world.The traitor, eating red bloody meat, drinking alcohol, and  speaking with the agent named Smith (5 letter S name!) - this Judas is  revenged upon, but is the indirect cause of Neo having to wake up and fight  the evil. Notice how he persuades Neo to run away from and fear the  agents!The other 'diciples' of the ship of liberty (Noahs Ark) are all  nice, tolerant, humble, accepting what God puts before them (Morpheus is  their entrusted leader) and do joke but not complain about the water and  bread (simple white nourishing substance) they have to eat, at that last  supper!!!As others have stated, 5 stars are too few, I must get this dvd  and find a dvd-player for it, allthough it truly belongs to the thx  theatre!This is my best movie experience ever!!!christian  (ironically;)	5.0	Matrix changed my life!!!	1999-09-25	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A2KP0ONGECY1WT	"cs211 ""cs211"""	"Being, apparently, one of the last people on Earth not to have seen ""The Matrix"", I finally caught up with my fellow man the other day and watched it for the first time.  I now understand firsthand what all the fuss was about at the time, and why there were several sequels, and why the movie has remained a favorite sci-fi film of many aficionados of the genre.  I can also see why a few people dislike it.  I think it is worthy of the adjective ""classic"", but it also has a few flaws.The plot's central element comes from a classic question posed in Philosophy 101 class (at least it was posed in mine), the ""brain in a vat"" problem:  if the brain is the center of all consciousness, and gets all its impressions of the outside world from bodily sensors attached to the brain via nerves, how can one prove that the outside world actually exists and that your brain is not actually just sitting in a vat bathed in fluid, with an evil genius stimulating your nerves to give the appearance of the outside world?  To this decades-old philosophical question some modern-day cyberworld twists are added, including the rise of machines with artificial intelligence and the preference that some people (many people?) have these days to spend more time in cyberspace than its physical world counterpart (meatspace).  The result is a compelling plot line for ""The Matrix"", but one that requires more than a little suspension of disbelief.This is one of the flaws of ""The Matrix"": to make a compelling movie, it needs to be possible for characters to re-enter the artificial world and for events in the artificial world to have a correspondence to events in the physical world.  Yet I don't think this would be the case if an  artificial world were to be created.  It also is a bit hard to believe that human bodies are good generators of energy, the explanation given for why the evil geniuses are keeping so many humans alive with their brains trapped in the artificial world.  By contrast ""Blade Runner"", my favorite sci-fi film, has an entirely plausible scenario and plot that needs only technology that hasn't yet been invented in order for the story to ring true.The other flaw of ""The Matrix"" is Keanu Reeves.  Reeves is a polarizing actor that rubs some people the wrong way.  Given his persona, the way he carries himself and his manner of speaking, he would seem best cast as a laid-back California slacker, yet he is often (as is the case in The Matrix) given heroic roles.  I can accept this for this film, but I can see why others can't.The best performance in The Matrix by far is Laurence Fishburne in the role of Morpheus.  Admittedly this is an even more heroic role than Reeves' character of Neo, but Fishburne does an outstanding job with it.  He truly commands the screen with his presence, actions and voice; it is a remarkable performance.  Many of the supporting roles are also well-acted, especially Morpheus' band of renegades (with the exception of the character of Mouse, whom I didn't care for).All in all ""The Matrix"" is definitely worth seeing if you happen to have been living in a cave for the past 13 years and haven't yet seen it."	5.0	I can see what all the fuss was about	2012-12-10	1	1	0

Be that as it may, this film blew everyone away the summer of 1999, myself included. Granted, it took several viewings to get the whole thing figured, but that's alright. A story like this doesn't come along very often, and the mind-blowing visual effects are worth watching again and again and again. Keanu Reeves really doesn't have to do much here, other than fight judo-style, but he really doesn't have to. Laurence Fishbune is fantastic as Morpheus, the leader of the human resistance. Carrie-Anne Moss is a knock-out in her role as Trinity, the love interest for Neo(Reeves), and a real tough chick in her own fights. This film began the Matrix trilogy, and is easily the best of the three. It can stand apart from the other two, as it was originally meant to be a one shot deal. Personally, that's how I think of this film : as a stand-alone achievement. Not many movies this day and age make people go ""huh?"" and think about things the way this one did.

I watched it 7 times in the last 3 days. I discovered something new every time I saw it.  The first time I watched The Matrix I was so stunned by the special effects that I really didn't follow the story. The second time I watched it I learned a little about the story but was still stunned by the special effects. After watching it 7 times I finally learned that the story is just as brilliant!!  I suppose the best way to describe The Matrix is &quot;YOU WILL BE IN AWE!!&quot; And this coming from myself who really doesn't like digital special effects.NO CHEEZY EFFECTS HERE FOLKS!!!!I ordered the DVD version of The Matrix.

0790745399	The Matrix	A72S4SWJWIBCV	Cutre	Green data that moves down over the computer screen making a high-pitched electronic noise. That's the code of the matrix. You ask what is the matrix? It is a hi-tech computer capable of reproducing a physical reality to all of us, humans. Once the humans created artificial intelligence, it quickly turned against us and it started a war of man against machine. Brain against software. And since the machines get their energy form the sun, the military scorched the sky, turning it into pitch black. But the machines were clever. They didn't need the sun to survive, they just needed some sort of energy, and they found that energy on the electrical impulses of our bodies. So all humans were taken as slaves and they were put into this huge prison, where they keep humans sleeping, but dreaming about reality, a reality created by the matrix so the human brains can keep working and producing all the energy the machines need to stay alive.But Thomas Anderson feels that reality is a little weird. It feels strange, he always has the feeling that he is dreaming because... he is! So that's why he's contacted by Morpheous, one of the people who's not in the Matrix. Morpheous believes Anderson is the key player to destroy the matrix and set all humans free. But before they do that, he has to convince Tom Anderson he's special and that he can do a lot more than what he believes.What we have here is one of the most interesting and intelligent science fiction films of all times. Yes, I said that. I've always liked Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne, but they practically seem like they were born for these roles! And this film is quite a treat for both the eyes and the brain. I was very pleased after I watched this movie, because it's not one of those sci-fi films that use special effects just to cover its plot holes or script weakness. The Matrix uses special effects only when it's necessary and the final result is outstanding!It has also one of the greatests soundtracks and scores I've heard and the whole deal about perception is something that will leave you thinking long after the final credits. If you're into sci-fi, and more especially, if you're into intelligent films, this one's for you!

0790745399	The Matrix	A24JKAVH5BEA1T	Dale H. Sarratt	I got into an argument about this movie with a friend's daughter.  I said it was so bad that I was not able to watch the entire movie after several attempts- it was just too boring and trashy. She's only 18 and ignorant, me 42 and wise. She was required to write a paper in college comparing this movie to Blade Runner. She of course trashed Blade Runner and loved Matrix, which is another story. Therefore to win the argument, I had to force myself to watch the thing, and what a terrible experience it was to watch it all the to the end. Some thoughts... 1. Terrible plot if you can understand it which most of us don't know what is going on. 2. Acting is terrible and forced. The characters are not intriguing and definitely not memorable. 3. Fighting scenes are a joke and worse than the typical B karate movie. 4. Gun battle are again, a joke. Why do they always think one guy can out battle an army with M16's? They can't. 5. Love scene? Where did this come from? There was no development for the eventual love scene, straight out of left field.  6. Music score is terrible and not one interesting song. The final two songs are disgusting and an insult to my being. One rap and the other some kind of heavy metal trash.Why this movie is liked by millions of people is a great mystery to me, except they can't or don't know quality. Save your money and buy the Blade Runner Director's cut, which is a true art form. If you are 16 you may like the movie for some of its special effects which are just typical in today's standards.	1.0	Boring and a waste of time and money!	2001-01-22	35	10	25
0790745399	The Matrix	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	One of the most satisfying movie experiences of all time, `The Matrix' will most likely be remembered...forever.  Despite Keanu's dry acting (this guy is horrible) a memorable character was born in Neo and his journey is one we won't soon forget.  The film is so much more than an action movie, giving us a deep and involving plot that challenges the audience to think hard about what's really going on.Neo (Reeves), a software technician with a hacking fetish, finds out first hand what his life really amounts to when he's introduced to Morpheus (Fishburne in a role that, get this, was originally offered to Russell Crowe).  Morpheus gives Neo the opportunity to embrace his reality, showing him that the world he knows is not the world in which he really lives.  The world itself has been destroyed and has been replaced by the Matrix, a faux world created by the robot rulers who are growing humans like batteries to keep themselves sustained.  Neo then agrees to leave the comforts of this Matrix in order to aid Morpheus in the fight for freedom from these robots.The special affects are out of this world, and the concept is one we've never entertained so it's fresh and exciting.  The acting is a bit bland, but the actors are not really the stars here.  I will say though that this was a big break out for two stars, Carrie-Anne Moss who plays Neo's love interest Trinity, and Hugo Weaving who plays the evil Agent Smith, a villain for the ages.`The Matrix' is that movie that started a movement, that movie that is beloved and followed and worshiped and campaigned as of one the greatest achievements in cinema and is surely one of the more respected films of our generation.  The Washowski brothers have created a film that will never be matched (maybe that's why they should have stopped here instead of pressing their luck with a trilogy).	5.0	Who doesn't want to go down this rabbit hole?	2006-12-29	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A3LXZ5GUIO3O4K	Dan d'Auteuil	The mythical rise of the loner-as-hero which constitutes much of  The Matrix  has certainly attracted its share of reclusive techno-geek types, as the many twists in the plot might have rung a bell or two, encouraging strong identification with the main character ; but, ultimately, the movie carries little food for thought, apart from a bunch of cheapo socio-philosophical concepts thrown together to impress and flatter. The staged rebeliousness, the fight against the  system , the whole concept of the movie is a gigantic smokescreen, a Dr FeelGood sort of thing, that has proven able to keep millions of generous souls soundly asleep, as the world keeps running its reckless course, spinning out of control, like a toy in the hands of a bunch of kids, too stupid and selfish to even bother about anything else than their own amusement. True, the movie  is an apt metaphor of our world. But who are the machines ?  them  or us ?  They  are truly human, after all : greedy, arrogant, and utterly senseless. On the other hand, we have become predictable clockwork mechanisms, rushing to get our share of stimuli. So, basically, we are being fed the stuff to keep us quiet. Don't be fooled by it : understand it for what it is. And remember, as Lenin said -and in that case he was quite right-, capitalists will sell us the rope to hang them. The Matrix, which is, for  them , only a money making machine, might well prove to be that rope, if only anyone could see it. Think about those execs summing up sales figures in their cosy offices. Think about that newly released second episode. You've read the raving reviews ; you've seen the crowds, eager to get their share of  action , desperate to know where the story goes ; you've witnessed friends and relatives, hopelessely addicted to sequels. Do you like it like that ? Do you really think you've discovered something ? What is  real  ? So, why not forget about the Wachowskis for a while, and read Chomsky.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2OL2X9S0UL0XY	"Dan ""Echoes of Autumn"""	i thought this movie had a great story. it can b a little confusing if ur not paying attention. the story is a good one all the same. it may not have quite as much action in it as the second or third movie, but it was more captivating then the others. i liked lobby scene were Neo and Trinity completely destroy an office building lobby. i think if u r going to watch the matrix, watch this one first and it will not be as dissapionting as it's sequals........	5.0	a very original movie	2005-03-19	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A3D2RF6KFFSKYW	Dan	The Matrix is the most incredible movie I've ever seen. It has incredible action and character developement. If you've only seen the movie once and didn't like it, don't be discouraged. It took me two times to fully  understand the movie. This movie beautifully puts together a scifi with an  action movie. The special effects are amazing. See this movie, rent this  movie, BUY this movie.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3T203I28ZKIG1	Daniel Alba	I love science fiction movies, and I think the matrix is one of the greatest movies in this genre. However, I was dissapointed when I buyed the DVD version and discovered the horizontal top and bottom black bars  displayed on the screen actually hide parts of the picture that are  viewable in the standard version (you can watch scenes displayed in  standard format on the DVD's special features). I conclude that DVD  technology is great, but not exploited in full.	2.0	widescreen format: a hoax.	2000-01-25	8	2	6
0790745399	The Matrix	A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2	"Daniel B. Waldman ""Film Guru"""	It always seems as though the same concept gets sold to a variety of Hollywood producers at about the same time &amp; a race is on to get out a product.  Last year two big rocks came to hit the Earth in two different  movies, for example.  The current big trend is Cyber-Space or alternate  reality.Three movies have been released at almost the same time about  this theme: The Thirteenth Floor, eXisTenz, and The Matrix.Matrix is,  admittedly, a lot of fun, even if it lacks the maturity of eXisTenz or the  more pure Sci/Fi attitude of Thirteenth Floor.  Matrix plays more towards  an action/adventure crowd and makes frequent use of the same type of  special effects as can be seen in those pants commercials where the kids  are dancing, then seem to freeze in mid-air.  Kind of neat, but we've seen  it before, and soon it will go the way of &quot;Morphing&quot; which T2  brought to a whole new level but isn't used too often anymore because of  the been-there, done-that attitude.Also, Keanu Reeves' final showdown  with the Computer Agent felt contrived.  He had a phone to catch, after  all, and the fight with these bad guys could have waited until the  sequel.Many have commented on the &quot;what-if&quot; our life is just a  computer program.  Kind of like what if our life is just a dream of the  fantasy and science fiction novels of not so long ago.  It isn't new, and  Matrix, rather than try to make the idea new, turns it into the starting  point for a story of a comic book hero.Most disturbing about this movie  is the scene where the heroes walk into the lobby of an office building and  shoot all of the guards.  This was overly reminiscent of the man who walked  into the lobby of the Capitol and opened fire.  I found the scene difficult  to applaud.  This is in contrast with a scene in T2 where Arnold, after  being told not to kill anyone, takes careful aim and shoots out tires and  lights rather than people.  The scene in Matrix might have played better if  the heroes were given more fanciful weapons.  Luke Skywalker had his  lightsaber, Indiana Jones had a whip.  These were pretty cool toys.  Keanu  Reeves, in the computer generated world, should have been able to come up  with something similarly fantastic.	3.0	Could have been better	1999-11-13	8	7	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A1QA9ZAQ3YRJ0B	Daniel Chan	One of the classic sci-fi/cyberpunk storylines is that our perceived reality is actually an illusion. Those who have enjoyed variations on this theme (Total Recall and Brazil come to mind) will be on familiar ground here. What makes The Matrix so enticing is the latest use of  computer-generated and -assisted special effects, particularly bullet-time  photography.Not since the dogfight sequences in the final battle around  the Death Star of Return of the Jedi have I been so bedazzled by the latest  FX technology. With bullet-time, slow-motion has never looked so flawless  and witnessing the 3D pan around the action made my heart race. Like the  dogfights around the Death Star, I was giddy.I will always prefer to  watch movies in big-screen cinemas with the best sound system available.  Otherwise, watching a fun movie like The Matrix at home on a big-screen TV  with an equally excellent sound system makes it just as worthwhile. The  added benefit of commentaries, behind-the-scenes material and other stuff  makes it moreso. I've also played this DVD on my Mac and had just as much  fun, although the picture could be bigger. :-)Speaking of Macs,  I would never know your review had anything to do with the movie. The only people I know who speak  so ill of the Macintosh are Mac-ignorant and PC-arrogant.For the record,  DVDs are cross-platform; there's no such thing as a PC-only DVD (I  certainly haven't seen one). Anyone who is having problems playing this DVD  on their computer either doesn't have a DVD-ROM or you need to apply a  software patch or upgrade.  As for Macs, OS9 will take care of everything. Otherwise, go to  for a  workaround.  on playing The Matrix on any computer. (I swear, I have no alliances with  PCFriendly.)	4.0	the story is familiar; long live bullet time!	1999-11-09	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	"Even though The Matrix was released in 1999, it can easily be considered the first motion picture of the twenty-first century, a movie unlike any that had come before.  This was the DVD that, upon its release, many of us bought in order to see just how good our new DVD players could be.  The special effects, with an exception or two, were unprecedented in terms of their scope, style, and presentation at the time, and the somewhat complex plot managed to capture the imagination of untold numbers of movie goers.  Combining science fiction, action, and adventure in an entirely new way, The Matrix was nothing if not exceedingly cool.  For once, I will not dwell on the plot; it is hard to explain, and those who know nothing about it can easily find summaries of it.  I will say, however, that I'm a little surprised that so many people embraced this movie with open arms because the plot is somewhat ambiguous, and the ending seemed to invite the possibility of a sequel without coming right out and announcing that it would happen.  I find similarities between this movie and Vanilla Sky in this regard, yet many who were totally confused by the latter film seem to embrace this one.  Laurence Fishburne was the real star of this movie, in my opinion, bringing life to Morpheus in such a way that made the convoluted plot seem plausible; a lesser actor in that role could have doomed The Matrix, no matter how incredible the special effects were.  Carrie-Anne Moss also blessed the character of Trinity with a humanity that enriches the film.  Keanu Reeves overcomes a couple of what I like to call David Schwimmer moments early on and grows into the type of hero this movie demands.As for the special effects, I found them exceedingly good but perhaps a tad overrated.  The early ""mouth"" effect, for example, was shockingly unimpressive, and the slow motion wave-like movement of bullets toward the end looks a little hokey to me; everything else was impressive indeed, though, particularly the famous jumps and helicopter sequence.  One of the really nice extras available on the DVD is the feature on the making of The Matrix.  While it takes a tiny little something away from the movie to see how those acrobatic jumps and fight scenes were filmed, one cannot but be deeply impressed by the level of commitment of the actors in terms of their months-long preparation and training.  The movie commentary offers more insight into the movie, and the music-only audio track is also a nice touch.  When I first dove in to the DVD owner pool, The Matrix instantly became the movie by which all of my DVDs were judged.  As time marches on, this has changed a little bit, but age should only enhance the fascination of movie lovers with this very impressive, unique, and extraordinarily cool film that heralded a brand new century in movie-making."	5.0	Moviemaking enters the 21st century	2003-05-02	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A13RM1AWD1C5ZR	Daniel K.	"The Matrix, an amazing and unique sci-fi thriller from the Wachowski brothers stunned the world.  It had a unique concept, in addition to remarkable and fresh visual and special efffects.Now the premise of this film is probably the hardest to explain,for it surely is intricate and complicated.  The film takes place sometime in the distant future, Reeves plays Thomas Anderson, a man who is searching for an answer to a certain question: What is the matrix?  Laurence Fishburne who is perfectly cast, plays Morpheus, a leader of a bunch of rebels searching for ""the one.""  Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity, a part of Morpheus's group and cause.  In this film there are many references to the bible, which you can easily figure from the names of characters.  All in all, confusing as you can tell.The Matrix was a sleeper hit of 1999, and soon became a box-office smash and global phenomenan.  The film intruced a fascination effect called Bullet-time, which was later copied in numerous movies, for example Charlie's Angels.  The action in this movie was innovative and inventive, and certainly appealing, from amazing kung-fu fights to intense shootouts.Though in comparison to the sequels, the origianly remains the best.  Of course in terms of action, the sequels definetly win especially Reloaded which featured the amazing ""burly brawl"" and ""freeway chase sequence.""  Revolutions also featured the amazing battle in Zion, which was groundbreaking in digital animation.  The sequels are a worth addition to the trilogy though and are definetly worth owning too, by the way Revolutions comes out on April 6, 2004.The Matrix is rated R for Sci-fi Violence and Brief Language.  The violence includes a lot of gunplay, including the amazing Lobby shootout sequence.  Some of which is bloody. The Matrix is suitable for kids 14 and up probably, for the violence isn't over the top.  cheoreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, who later did work on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  The language is mild and not particularly strong.  There is also mild sexual innuendo.  The Matrix, infact as I stated earlier the entire trilogy is worth owning espeically on DVD, if you haven't seen any see one of them today, and obviously start with The Matrix, the one which started it all.

I give it 5 stars for THE MATRIX itself and 5 stars for the bonus features.  If you're not into production notes or &quot;Easter eggs,&quot; then buy THE MATRIX strictly for the movie, but the additional features are rather nice, including a short HBO documentary, commentary by Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity) as well as editor Zach Staenberg and visual effects supervisor John Gaeta, and a music-only track.  Explore a little further, and you'll stumble upon a demonstration of Gaeta's &quot;Bullet Time&quot; effect from conception to final realization, not to mention a few other video goodies.As an aside, if you don't have home theater speakers for your DVD yet, THE MATRIX should give you an excuse to buy some.

0790745399	The Matrix	A17R5GAFO46W6T	Dan Miller	A lot of the reviews of this very entertaining film mention the various sources it draws from: other films, comics, &quot;cyberpunk&quot; fiction (particularly that of William Gibson.) All this is true, but mostly on a superficial level. The real source of the foundation concept of &quot;The Matrix&quot; is the brilliant 1968 Sci-Fi novel &quot;The Futurological Congress&quot; by Stanislaw Lem. I'm not talking about some kind of coincidental parallel here.

I'm equally if not more astounded by how many felt compelled to give it 5 stars. To each his own, I guess. I saw this on a rainy Saturday and it was not my first choice. I can't even remember what we originally wanted to see but it was sold-out so we got stuck seeing ""The Matrix"". Anyway, I will give this film the two stars for its ground-breaking special effects. They were cool. That said, I cannot for the life of me understand what so many people find so fascinating about this film. I read some of the 5-star reviews and it never ceases to amaze me. I might possibly need to see this film again to try and get what everybody else did and what apparently went way over my head. I know there was a ton of existentialist, futuristic, mumbo-jumbo philosophizing going on and truth to tell I was bored out of my mind. I honestly couldn't wait for the closing credits.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3BJHQSDEPOPTJ	Dan Reef	&quot;The Matrix&quot; is one of the weirdest movies that I have ever seen, by a country mile. A good bit of it is believable, but not when Neo gets shot twelve times and is alive just because some girl kisses him. This hit asks the question &quot;Gee, are we living a life every day that is a part of our imagination? Gee, are our REAL bodies in a deserted cell, lying motionless like a catatonic patient?&quot; The special effects are especially good, but having the same gun-toting quackers in expensive suits with handguns make this more like a lost effort. Parts of the science of this are interesting like the spoon(it bended, Keanu didn't balance it on his nose), but it shows Keanu and Lawrence in something that appears to be a fight with the mind, himself, it doesn't intrigue me or make much sense to me. Keanu, the only movie that you actually acted in was &quot;The Devils Advocate&quot;. This movie is as overrated as Alexei Kovalev and the end of it...well, there really isn't an end after the phone is hung up.

The special effects were one in a million (ooooh bullet time, one of the best concieved peices of special  effects since Star Wars), as was the acting. Keaunu Reeves was his usual  charismatic self (whoah), Laurence Fishburne was brilliant as the  mysterious Moebious and local actor Hugo Weaving was brilliant as the evil  construct of the Matrix.

The Matrix es controlada por los Agentes, siendo Smith (genialmente interpretado por Hugo Weaving) el mas mort&iacute;fero de todos. &Eacute;stos secuestran a Morpheus, para que les de el c&oacute;digo de acceso a Zion, la &uacute;ltima ciudad de los humanos, que se encuentra cerca del n&uacute;cleo de la Tierra, y as&iacute; poder invadirla y destruirla. Es por eso que Neo y Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss) entran a The Matrix, y salvan a Morpheus. Las creencias de &eacute;ste eran ciertas: Neo es el Elegido. Luego de descubrir esto, Neo elimina al Agent Smith, y ganan los buenos. Como siempre...El gui&oacute;n no tiene pr&aacute;cticamente ning&uacute;n error, salvo por una cuesti&oacute;n un tanto complicada: Seg&uacute;n dicen por ah&iacute;, THE MATRIX ES UN COMPLETO ROBO A &quot;THE INVISIBLES&quot;, de Grant Morrison, comic que fue publicado por Vertigo, imprint de DC Comics, hace unos a&ntilde;os.

Si sos de otro pa&iacute;s, pod&eacute;s escucharlo a trav&eacute;s de [...]A pesar de haber ganado el Oscar a los mejores efectos especiales en el a&ntilde;o 1999, &eacute;stos no son tan espectaculares como se dice. Son muy buenos, s&iacute;. El efecto Bullet-Time es excelente, y millones de pel&iacute;culas lo han copiado. Pero hay cosas que no terminan de cerrar. Como cuando Trinity se tira de un edificio a otro, y da una vuelta en el aire. Esa escena es horrible, y no es para nada cre&iacute;ble. Otra escena muy fea es la de la cuchara. Se nota DEMASIADO que la cuchara es producto del CGI. No es cre&iacute;ble. Realmente no s&eacute; por qu&eacute; esta pel&iacute;cula le gan&oacute; el Oscar a Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.La m&uacute;sica compuesta por Don Davis es realmente magn&iacute;fica.

The story revolves around Neo (Reeves), a computer hacker, who finds out that the world he lives in is an illusion and has been constructed in the actual REAL world, which is controlled by computers.  A great sci-fi story with interesting biblical references (the character named Trinity, Neo being the &quot;One&quot; chosen to save mankind, as examples) draws you in and keeps you wanting more.  Luckily we have two more sequels to look forward to!  The dvd has some special extras, such as the &quot;HBO Making of&quot;, behind the scene featurettes and more.  I've watched this dvd several times and find something new each time.  It also has a really good supporting cast, including Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss.  You don't have to be a sci-fi fan or a Keanu Reeves fan to enjoy this film.  I highly recommend it.	5.0	Keanu Kills in this one!	2002-02-10	3	1	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A1RIZ4H8TBFISK	Daryl	What is the Matrix?!? - A Quite Amazing film. The Story line being quite complex however, so you might have to sit down and watch this one a few times. I have seen this film so many times I have lost count, The effects in the film are so outstanding they will blow you away. One of the stand out effects for me was Bullet time - never been seen before except on Japenese films, Andy and Larry Wachowski (Bound) really push the computer effects to the limit when Neo (Keanu Reeves) decides to dodge bullets fired from an enemy gun.  The Story line basically goes like this. A computer Hacker named Allias Neo (Keanu Reeves) is searching for the question, the question is &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot;, he thinks that when he finds the answer to this it will make sense of his life.  Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) Is the comander of a ship who is searching for the one, now he has found Neo he thinks that his search is over.	5.0	Bullet Time	2000-11-20	3	2	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A39V7N73EZQBI9	Dave B	Once in a great while a movie comes along that grabs ahold of me in some weird way I can't quite explain, and it won't let go. (Perhaps Morpheus can explain it...)  When that happens, I have to see it multiple times to get  'free' of its spell.  The Matrix has done that to me; it continues to  captivate me.Okay, there were a few problems with the story - but there  were so many astonishing points that those problems simply got washed away.  There was hundreds of tiny little details in the production that you'll  miss the first time around;  but they add so much to the overall feel and  effect of the film.  The scipt was incredible in that it managed to put  some complicated concepts into very simple, easy to understand lines -  delivered in a sequence of events that helped to illustrate those  concepts...  The casting was great in that it matched such a diverse and  tallented group (I am a fan of Keanu Reeves even in bad movies...) The  character development was superb - especially that of the 'agents', with  their ultra-precise movements and slightly choppy speach.  And the special  effects!I tend to be a  nit-picker on sci-fi movies.  On this one, I  simply don't want to.  I'm content to let the problems go.  I very highly  recommend it to any sci-fi fan.	5.0	See it!	1999-12-08	3	2	1
0790745399	The Matrix	AS54RFS6PCIQK	"Dave ""debrea@boo.net"""	If you are into special effects, breath-taking action and maximum sound, this is the movie for you.  The special effects (such as the pausing of action as the camera angle changes as well as the slowing and increasing  speeds of action sequences)are truly the first of its kind , and has  already started to be copied by new movies coming out.  The DVD is packed  with many extra features which makes it a must-have for everyone.  The  sound and picture quality are great and will test the limits of any A/V  system.  I never thought I would like a movie with K. Reeves, but he is  actually very good in this movie...I think it is because he didn't have to  act to much.  This is a sci-fi thriller that will keep you on the edge of  your seat, and lift you out of the seat in its action-packed final minutes.	5.0	The Matrix redefines Sci-Fi movie making	2000-01-06	2	2	0

This movie made me think &quot;what if&quot; all this is true, and I am programmed everyday to do things I normally wouldn't do. Its kind of scary if you think of it. I never get tired of watching this movie. No matter how many times I have seen it before.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"Judging from the volume of reviews for ""The Matrix"" at this web-site I surmise that there's not much new that can be really said about it, other than it's a great film and a landmark in sci-fi.  Recently I was watching the recent DVD issue of George Lucas' first feature film, THX-1138.  The basic plots of these films seem to mirror one another: futuristic society where the human populace is controlled by malevolent machines.  The difference between the two films is that ""The Matrix"" has a more fleshed out plot and better production values.  It's not the only comparison I can make between the Wachowskis film and a George Lucas film.  When ""The Matrix"" was released in the spring of 1999 it practically made irrelevant the upcoming release of Lucas' ""Phantom Menace""."	5.0	Short and Sweet	2004-10-07	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	ADJ1SKR6OHKBJ	David Baldwin	Having had a quick look through all the reviews for this film, it seems that there is a general consensus that it's a great film. Well, sorry to be the odd one out, but I found it immensely boring and pretentious. Yes, I  admit that the fight scenes are excellent, breathing new life into screen  combat. But what the hell is the story on about? It really wants to be a  philosophical allegory, including bits on religion and Alice In Wonderland  etc etc. It's not - it comes across some kind of weirdo's fantasy, all  blazing guns and S&amp;M leather (just like Bound, the directors' previous  film). It really has no depth to it at all, but if you want a film to just  enjoy, then  suppose you could do worse than this. You'll just have to wade  through over an hour and a half until you get to anything good...but that's  what DVD can do, so in many ways it's a great film for the format. The  extras are copious and well put together, with the White Rabbit  feature  quite fun along with a great documentary on the filming of the bullet time  technology, all wrapped up in some snazzy menus (but the commentary is  quite tedious). The Matrix thinks it's clever, and spends half the film  trying to tell you this, which is the main reason I didn't like it. That,  and it's boring. Still, it has its moments. Shame they last for a minute  each.	1.0	Pretentious with a capital P	2000-05-15	30	12	18
0790745399	The Matrix	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Although I didn't find this film to be as profound as many of the other reviewers did, it is certainly clever and very smartly written.  I was impressed at how smoothly the Wachowskis managed to fit the conventions of martial arts films into a technological context.  The story is pure comic book--and I mean that in the best sense of the word.  A seemingly average guy meets some mysterious types who introduce him to the reality behind our everyday world and becomes a superhero to battle the evil he finds there.  One of the most interesting facets of the story is the fact that our heroes exist in two worlds simultaneously--in one they are superhuman, while in the other they are nearly helpless.	5.0	Pure entertainment	2001-02-15	2	0	2

0790745399	The Matrix	AI9STF7QHFDGV	"David Coy ""Author of the Dominant Species Series"""	"Over the years since its release, I've racked my brain for SF concomitants or analogs, shared themes that might have formed the basis for this film. I look everywhere, search thousands of SF films watched, all the late night B horror and cheesy SF I watched as a kid, even back into the annals of The Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits. Nothing. I find no exact matches. I find minor archetypes sure, even one or two broad but thin ones, but no real conceptual basis between what came before and this film. I get the broad ""computer-wants-to-destroy humanity"" theme a couple of times, notably the progenitor of the notion in ""The Forbin Project"". The ""Terminator"" series shares the concept as well. But it's that nasty little ""use-the-humans-as-batteries"" idea that throws you. Add to that unprecedented originality the perfect storyline and dialog to bring it to you and you're almost there. Layer on the cinematic beauty of the film itself and the remarkable special effects and you have a one-of-a-kind work of art. Don't forget the characters, rich and fully defined. Even the antagonists, though computer generated entities, have a surprisingly all-to-human side.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3GKOMCQTTWPUI	"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL"""	"If there has to be a quint- essential film for the end of the millennium, this is it. I've never seen a movie that blended so exhilaratingly high-concept science- fiction, nerve pounding action and philosophical allegory, a movie in which content and style are so in synch. Keanu Reeves (surprisingly cool in Jet Li mode) stars as Thomas Anderson, a mild-mannered software programmer who moonlights as an expert hacker under the name of Neo. His existence is about to change drastically when he's contacted by a mysterious group of rebels led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne, impeccable), who believes that Neo is the chosen one and is determined to prepare him to face his destiny : freeing the human race from the Matrix. Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is; you have to see it for yourself. Besides, I don't want to spoil one of the film's pleasures, which is to gradually discover the truth at the same time as Neo. I'll just say it has something to do with the world as we know it being just an illusion created by an empire of intelligent machines where a small Resistance struggle to defeat the deadly Agents.The film was written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, whose sexy, stylish film noir ""Bound"" was an extremely promising debut. I was really looking forward to see what they would do with some real money, and man was I not disappointed. Their sophomore effort is unique, ambitious and thought-provoking. The plot is very interesting: it's an exploration of how much we can or can not trust what our minds sense as reality. The film's nightmarish theory is that what we call reality is actually some kind of computer enhanced virtual reality. Therefore, it is possible to bend or break the rules we take for granted, gravity for instance. That's what Neo, Morpheus and their crew (which include Carrie-Anne Moss as a tough babe and Joe Pantoliano as a shady lad) are set to do, and so are the Wachowski brothers. With plenty of imagination ant the first-rate SFX to support it, they crafted one of the most visually stunning films ever.What's amazing is that all the nifty visual tricks they use never feel forced or show-offy: it always feels natural within the film's universe. I also love the idea that the characters are able to download knowledge unto their brains. The Wachowski had the particularly brilliant brainchild to have their heroes use this technique to turn themselves into experts at jiu-jitsu, kung fu, tae kwan do, kempo and even drunken boxing! This leads to some of the most out-of-this-world fights this side of Hong Kong (the fights were actually choreographed by HK legend Yuen Wo Ping). This is in part what makes ""The Matrix"" so special. Unlike most high-concept sci-fi (like last year's ""Dark City""), it is not only visionary and intelligent but also as action packed as any Aliens or Blade. It's the kind of movie that never stops surprising you. In a way, ""The Matrix"" is about the magic of cinema itself, about how filmmakers like the Wachowski bros simulate reality and have the power to bend its rules to fit their vision."	5.0	Classic...	2005-11-20	3	2	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A2YNIQ6HCJSNGG	David Giddins	Even the way in which the Village Roadshow logo appears at the beginning of the screening is good! Carrie Anne Moss starts the movie with a solid and heavy act, clearing her way through four groups of guys(agents)in suits  to jump from building to building. Seeing the making to the film on the DVD  and to know how the produced special effects of its kind does not at all  destroy the way I look at the movie at all. As much as I love the movie,  Keanu does slightly overact and Carrie Anne Moss goes a bit over the top  aswell. Laurence Fishbourne does an accurate job as 'Morphious' in what to  me is definately the best sci-fi film ever made(and the Star Wars films are  sci-fi)There is a storyline, although I must admit that it does drag on a  bit, but we are rewarded with more than expected special effects which in  its style has never been seen before in Hollywood(the world)The effects are  packed throughout the entire film in a very clever way. My personal  favourite is where Neo(Reeves)dodges bullets fired by an agent on the enemy  side to the Morpious team. The blockbuster has a fair soundtrack to go with  the film which contains extinct matrix tunes, which now you hear on  television commercials, movie trailors and on tv. Face it, we've never seen  anything like it before! The matrix will surely bring a lot of ideas into  the minds of new and future directors and scriptwriters. The sequel is  something to look forward to. The only worry I'm having now is that they  don't ruin the feeling with a bad sequel.	5.0	Is SIX stars too much to ask for?	2000-03-16	4	4	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A2OVUDBRWGX0LL	David	The first and the best of the trio of the Matrix movies.  The Wachowski brothers spin a tale of a man, Neo, played Keanu Reeves, who is awakened from the dream that he has been living his entire life.  He learns that his life has merely been part of a computer-generated matrix, a 'reality' created by machines for all of humanity in their version of a final solution.  The humans dream their lives away while the machines siphon off their biological energy to power their world.As the &quot;Chosen One,&quot; Reeves is trained for the purpose of defeating the machines by destroying their matrix--the computer programs that keep humanity enslaved.The movie borrows elements from Tron and injects philosophical and martial arts aspects.  Many of the special effects are outstanding, as are the physical combat scenes between the heroic humans and the sadistic agents (computer programs that serve as assassins).  While some of story goes unexplained--such as how Morpheus knew Neo was the &quot;Chosen One,&quot; and how they manage to continually tap into the matrix with no opposition--it is still wonderful storytelling.  The end of the movie is, actually, only the beginning of the story.Excellent sci-fi entertainment.  It's a shame the sequels weren't as good.	4.0	Welcome To The Real World	2004-03-11	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A2F2VIZX9WJ22A	David	The films's entire premise rests on the fact that reality is a dream and that the real real world is somehow different to the one that we perceive. This is Philosophy 101 and while providing a couple of hours of animated  discussion over a few beers is hardly the 'deep' or 'thought-provoking'  original experience most reviewers seem to think, unless they need Holywood  to do all their thinking for them.The plot is so full of holes it is  unbelievable, any truely great sci-fi film has to stand up to at least  cursory examination (dont use humans use any less sentient but more  efficient beings thereby obviating the need for the matrix(or a more  efficient chemical or nuclear reaction), why have the agents wear  sunglasses and suits? (in fact the whole agent thing is a mess)) and the  level of violence using guns does seem to make this look like a commercial  for the manufacturers, (why use brains or even a plot when you just have to  shoot everyone in sight in gunfights that just seem to go on forever).Finally I didnt even really care what happened to the characters if that  was humanity's best hope I'm afraid it left me cold.As to the special  effects you only need to compare two previous efforts with groundbreaking  effects, Lawnmover Man and Toy Story, both led the field in effects but the  first was lousy the second great because, in the end, what matters is the  script and the acting (even by cartoons). The effects soon become  irrelevent particularly as as technology improves all films will be able to  look like the Matrix but I hope at least some will provide a better use of  2 hours.	1.0	Thin And Violent	2000-01-21	47	12	35

But, if that's the case, I can make this recommendation: watch this one and forget the other two exist.  As a stand-alone movie, it was great.  The sequels, well, how to put this lightly....sucked.  I understand that such language probably isn't necessary in a respectable review, but I really can't think of any other way to put it.But this isn't a review about :Reloaded or :Revolutions, is it?Simply put, a departure from a lot of other action movies out there.  It was a refreshing change.  Well directed, good story line, and exceptionally successful, even with the surprising and welcome lack of a superfluous and unneccessary nude scene (thank you very much :Reloaded for proving that you somehow feel obligated to throw it in there anyway).

If you want to watch a mindless sci fi shoot 'em up action flick and still think you are smart because it has such a &quot;deep&quot; meaning behind it, then by all means see this movie.  Otherwise don't waste your time.  The fact that Keanu is front and center on the cover ought to say something.  And if you just want to see Carrie Anne Moss (sp?), see Memento instead.

On the surface you say a pretty good movie, however, you are always on the outside looking in.  Unlike  other thrillers of its genre, it fails to suck you in and keep you alert  the entire movie.  Also, occasionally the special effects were overdone  and, truthfully, boring.	4.0	Good, but underdone in some areas and overdone in others	2000-01-04	4	0	4
0790745399	The Matrix	A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ	David M. Lovin	&quot;The Matrix&quot; was a real sleeper hit of 1999.  It is one of the few movies which incorporate a large amount of computer generated special effects and have them play a major role in the plot.  Most movies with lots of computer help just have the special effects in the movie, but they are unnecessary.  This film needs all the effects it has to make the story believeable.The movie tells us of a man named Neo(Keanu Reeves) who works at a software company (when he gets up on time), and does lots of illicit computer hacking work off the clock.  He has been searching for a seemingly mythical figure named Morpheus.  Through a series of strange events, Morpheus(Lawrence Fishburne) contacts Neo and brings him to a meeting with the help of the leather clad Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss).  At this meeting, Morpheus drops a complete bomb on Neo- that his life as he has known it means nothing.The world is actually controlled by machines who use human infants like batteries, absorbing the body heat for power.  The computers invented an imaginary &quot;Matrix&quot; for the humans to live in, which is the world we now inhabit.  Because we are so comfortable here, we don't try to break out and get away from the control of these machines.  Morpheus and his select crew of assistants on his ship are fighting against the machines in the real world, which has no sunlight and has suffered mass destruction from the numerous battles over the years.  Neo has to make a decision whether to join the battle or to go back to the blissful ignorance of the Matrix.The special effects in the movie are great and are well used.  The fighting sequences and the jump sequences when the camera spins 360 degrees around the person are really cool.  There is a scene where someone in the group has to be rescued from the Agents(machines in human form in the Matrix) and the effects of the gunfire and destruction are some of the best you will see.  The film would suffer without the fantastic computer visual effects it has.Interesting, how much this movie references Christianity and the Bible.  The last human city is called Zion, the character Trinity is a reference to the holy trinity, the character Neo is obviously patterned after Jesus Christ, as the one saviour of the world.  How about Morpheus's ship being called the Nebukadnezzar, after the king in the bible?  There is even a Judas type figure who betrays the whole group.In general, the Matrix is a very slick sci-fi thriller with lots of action, a cool storyline, and lots of effects which are real fun.  The sequels (one of which I have seen and one I have not) simply can't match up to this.  I recommend this film for any action fan's shelf.	5.0	Free your mind...	2003-12-10	1	0	1

Reed	"Please note: I am not reviewing the movie (which is a personal favorite of mine, for the amazing story, the stunning visuals, and the profound philosophical elements).  What I am reviewing is the 'upgrade' to Blue-ray. This is why I purchased this (I already have the standard DVD).On the matter of the Blu-ray upgrade, I found this nominally acceptable. I have a 30"" 1080ip led flatscreen that is rated for slightly-above average performance (for its class). I personally think my TV performs exceptionally well. I also have top-quality, internet-enabled Blue-Ray dvd player.  I mention this because your experience of this media will almost certainly vary depending on the type of display and the type of player.On the whole, I do feel I got an upgrade: the images had a sharpness and a depth that improves upon the non Blue-ray version; and the colors also seemed to benefit from the upgrade. Not a lot, mind you.Bonus material was not significantly improved upon.This was a difficult review to write because 1) it is largely subjective, based as it is on my perceptions, and 2) subject to the technology variables that obtain from the player and TV being used.Still, I hope this helps.Peace"	3.0	Worth upgrading to BR?	2012-05-19	1	0	1

It is a visually stunning movie.  To all those who feel the need to complain about  a lack of originality in the plot, read a book.  If you want to be  intellectually stimulated stop going to the movies.  And for all of you  that have cited recent movies, books, and comic books that it resembles,  educate yourselves a little more.  The philosophical debate on what is real  is as old as Plato.  In short if you are looking for originality and deep  thoughts stop going to the movies and pick up a book.	5.0	Excelent Brain Candy	1999-12-31	1	0	1

The Matrix was  brilliantly written, it would have been a smash hit with high school actors  in it, but what set it apart from every other movie in recent memory was  the tight delivery by actors you wouldn't expect it from. personally i  can't wait for the sequels! and i'm going to make a point to see more  Wachowski movies! i definately recomend this movie. &quot;I can only show  you the door, you must walk through it.&quot;	5.0	Is this movie the &quot;One&quot;?

0790745399	The Matrix	A38EQCXYMH63QX	David Slicer	The Matrix is an action packed sci-fi epic that has all the elements of a graphic comic novel jammed with incredible visual effects and the most  spetacular action scenes to hit the screen since Terminator 2:Judgment  Day.This is one of my all time favorites due to the fact that the film is  packed with a cast that we can cheer for.Keanu Reeves plays the role of Neo  who discovers one day the world he is living in is an illusion controled by  machines that have taken over the world to enslave mankind.Neo meets  Morpheous played by Laurence Fishburne who believes Neo has been chosen to  save humanity from The Matrix.Carrie Ann Moss is Trinity.Hugo Weaving makes  a very impressive villain known as Agent Smith.The Matrix really packs a  mean punch for those who really love kung fu films ranging from Bruce Lee  to Jackie Chan.From Jackie Chan to Jet Li.The film is also my favorite  because I think it pays respect to the John Woo films.What makes the film  work so good is Keanu Reeves.Imagine how The Matrix would have turned out  if Arnold Schwarnegger or Steven Seagal played Neo.Would I still have seen  The Matrix?Yes I would,but Schwarnegger is not right for the role of  Neo.Steven Segal...forget it.Keanu Reeves is one of the most talented  actors around today.The Matrix fits Keanu as tight as an iron glove which  is why I think Keanu Reeves is the perfect choice for this movie.I have  seen this film over 35 times.28 in the movie theaters.The idea for The  Matrix made me wonder how much of an imagination I have in the back of my  head.Believe me,it's alot.The Matrix is truly the kind of film that will  make you explode.Definetly worth seeing.	5.0	A spetacular vision that will make your head explode.	2000-08-26	1	1	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A1OIZF48LYZ6U2	David Stripling	I thought the movie I saw on the screen reflected accurately the movie I saw in my head as I read the screenplay.  After seeing the movie start to finish at the theater and on video, I watched it scene by scene reading the  screenplay for each scene beforehand.  I was surprised at how close each  scene on the screen was to each scene in the screenplay.  It was also  interesting to see how the mood of each scene, for both place and  characters, was translated so accurately by the directors from the written  word to the image on the screen.  The dialogue on the screen was also very  close to the dialogue in the screenplay.This movie seemed to have a  strong plot that took an unnerving premise and developed it through good  storytelling using bigger-than-life characters that the audience could  still relate to in some way. The action scenes, while dramatic and  forceful, did not seem to get in the way of the development of either the  plot or the characters.The only thing I would liked to have seen is an  acknowledgement by the protagonist (Neo), or one of his comrades (in  reflective exposition by Morpheus perhaps), that Cypher had a valid point.  Cypher's point that life in the Matrix for him could be a better choice  than &quot;real&quot; life outside it.  The price of that choice is, in  effect, slavery but it is a price that after nine years of  &quot;reality&quot; with Morpheus he was anxious to pay.  Extending that  thinking, it's clear that many other humans would share his view and create  something of a problem for the resistance is &quot;freeing&quot; humans,  some of whom would not want to be freed from the Matrix.This idea was  alluded to briefly by Morpheus when he told Neo that many people would have  difficulty being freed from the Matrix and some would never give it up.  I  just thought that some acknowledgement by these freedom fighters that  freedom was a relative thing for Cypher and, by extension much of humanity,  would be a point worth developing.  We often hold onto belief systems that  have little support in the real world simply because we find comfort in  them.The fiction wraps around an idea that forces us to look at and  question not only our beliefs but our reasons for holding those beliefs.  This is uncomfortable for many of us.  Especially if the belief system  questioned is a spiritual one.  It is an idea that should be thought about,  not dismissed for minor plot points.The plot point about batteries, I  think that was merely an anology used within the context of the plot to  explain the role humans had come to play in the new order - they were  serving machines, rather than the reverse - and were doing so through the  bio-technology, if you will, of their bodies that is more efficient than  any mechanical device made by man or machine at that time in the context of  the story.  I believe that the exposition explaining this came from  Morpheus to Neo early in Neo's awakening as a voiceover to the &quot;human  harvesters&quot; scene doing their gathering of human infants from the  fields.It was a well-written, well-directed, and stunning movie at both  the visual and auditory levels with a compelling idea - that our reality is  what our brains tell us it is - and that reality, and our beliefs that are  built on it, can be shaped for us by someone else for their own ends.Whomever greenlighted this, I'm glad they did.	5.0	Cypher had a point....	2000-01-17	0	0	0

Their sci-fi movie is worthy to be placed in the same league as Dune, which prior to this movie was the best I've seen on the screen or anywhere! Although it's another  version of Disney's Tron, it goes much further into the possibilities of  what truth is actually about and who may be controlling your idea of it in  the not too distant future!  Fact is, our reality today is just about the  way it is in the movie except for the software mirage the movie poses - or  does it? It has me wondering!  I'm watching it at least 2 more times.

I did notice the difference in the video.  The details in the faces of the characters is crisp.  The action sequences were stunning.  This movie is visually appealing.  Although the audio is uncompressed 5.1, I was hoping there was a 7.1 audio track.  Even in Dolby TrueHD, I was hoping for more surround effects.  Still, it's worth the purchase.  This movie was a breakthrough when it came out, and if you're a fan, it's definitely worth the purchase.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2XILEETU7VV7L	Dawn	Personally I think that this movie is not much what it was hyped up to be.  Much like that other overrated movie in 1999 called  Star Wars Episode  1.This movie supposedly brags a very &quot;unique&quot; story. I  personally dont think so. To me it is nothing more than a normal plot that  could have been used in an episode of &quot;the Twilight Zone&quot; with  alot of special effects.The special effects are very good. And that  is what keeps this movie from being a complete mess. I saw how they made  the revolutionary effects and that was very cool. The sound effects are  very good too. This is one of those DVD's like &quot;Saving Private  Ryan&quot; that has sound soooo good it makes you proud to have a DVD  player. The sound, picture quallity, and the extras are what made me get  the DVD.The acting in this movie is horrible. Lt me repeat that,  horrible! I hate Reeves's acting. To me I think that the acting is one of  the most vital roles to a movie. The rest of the cast's acting is not  Academy Award winning either.The direting is fairly good,  escpecially for a sci-fi juggernaut of a film, but I do not advise turning  the movie into a a trilogy like the Star Wars movies. That would be a utter  mess. The directors of this movie had a box office hit and now they think  they can keep the franchise going. Soon we will be seing everything from  action figures to lunchboxes that have been spawned from this redicules  movie. Not only are they turning it inot a trilogy, they are filming the  movies back to back. The Star Wars movies took years to write and plan.  They turned out marvelous except the latest installment. The Matrix is  being made within a few years. That is what you call rushing the movies to  cash in on the original and ruining the whole series.Remember the  &quot;Rocky&quot; series. One big hit that was really good untill the  endless terrible sequels it spawned ruined that reputation and respect for  the original.I hope this review has been helpful to you, and thank  you for your time.	3.0	Ok, lets not get carried away..........	2000-08-13	5	2	3

The special features on the DVD are pretty cool to.  After you've seen the movie a few times (trust me, it's so fast paced, you'll notice something new each time), I recommend watching it in ""Follow the White Rabbit"" mode.

0790745399	The Matrix	A28ENDWOL9CAJJ	"D. Bailey ""fontosaurus@gmail.com"""	The Matrix is an excellent movie that combines science fiction, shoot-em-up action, and philosophical questions about the nature of Reality.  If you are plugged in to a computer, and that computer presents you with a reality that is completely indistinguishable from your own, is it any less real?This movie has exceptional special effects, beautiful cinematography, an excellent soundtrack, well-crafted dialogue, and respectable acting.  Keanu Reeves may be a lousy actor, but I think that the Matrix is probably his best performance to date.The Platinum Limited Edition isn't really worth the extra money unless you're an absolute, die-hard, take the red pill, freak.  I wish I had known that before ordering this product.  It comes in a box about as thick as an encyclopedia, and is fairly large, so it won't fit on the shelf with the rest of your DVDs.  Opening it up, I was rather disappointed -- most of the volume is filled with a cheap plastic tray that contains a celluloid clip of the film with a blown-up photo (decent, but nothing fantastic), a few postcard-sized stills from the movie, and a copy of the normal DVD in a normal case.  Nothing fantastic.  For this money, I was expecting a DVD with DTS sound, alternate angles, deleted scenes, etc., but just got the same old Matrix disc.  A major drag.Do yourself a favor.

The Picture Quality is nice, better than than DVD, but not HD quality of course. The sound dissapointed me and perhaps using DTS-HD would have been better.

Anyone who has  really loved something before instantly realizes that this is one of the  coolest movies ever.  If you have ever dreamed of being a super hero  before, this is your chance to see it happen.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2GLFKM6IBYRP7	Dean Sullivan	The Matrix is by far the best film Keanu Reeves has been involved with. This is also the best sci-fi film available on DVD. The film is kind of a mixture of the Terminator and Dark City, but still seems to be very  original. The action scenes are some of the best since John Woo's Face off,  and plays in well with the fast beating soundtrack. Why should you buy this  film? The special effects are incredible, and look fantastic on DVD; the  story is well written and has some enjoyable twists; the film is well acted  and the direction exceptional; the DVD as loads of extra features, with  truly to many to list; its an outstanding movie. I love this film, and  think it's a great film to add to any action/sci-fi fans collection.

Cyberpunk doesn't really exist in today's culture, but it was so apparent in the 80's, perhaps because it was so long ago, now we feel in shock when we look at the calendar and see the number 2008! I can't imagine what things will even be like in 2010! This movie single handedly slays any of those awesome 80's cyberpunk movies and takes it's place at the right hand of the cyber gods. You're not a real fan if you don't agree, this movie is the best of it's kind, and majorly entertaining, more-so to those that imagine possibilities like that actually being possible in the future. You need to have an imagination to love this movie, and be in awe of all the far out sci-fi ideas, that's what all the great sci-fi movies are supposed to do, awe you with their vision of how things could be in the future. And they say that sci-fi movies quite literally fortell reality! I get tired of medieval movies, and action, but I love cyber stuff so much. It's like the movie Transformers, a typical person will dismiss it as a regular movie, but a real fan will love it so much, and love the music, and love the hot chick, and love the action scenes, and the special effects, and even the story. A real fan watches a movie and gets ideas for his own story from it to turn into a movie.

Breathtaking scenes and unbelievable special effects give this movie gloss and the coolest look of any movie in recent memory.  There's a huge reason why everyone buys this movie when they buy their first DVD player: it screams to be viewed in surround sound and crisp images.And if the special effects reviews don't sway you, the acting will.  These actors LIVE techno cool, in their full-length leather coats and sunglasses, even the shocking way they appear after they &quot;go down the rabbit hole.&quot;  They inhabit their characters in ways few action movie actors bother to do.You MUST see this - and you'll want to see it more than once, a good reason to make this a purchase and not rent it.

Since I am not a modern-day movie fan (an old movie buff) I had not followed the  hype regarding this movie.  My teenaged son begged me to watch it with him,  so I did.  The very first couple of scenes were very confusing and I kept  threatening to stop watching, but then I started to get interested.  I  thought the special effects were great.  I did find it just a little bit  difficult to follow the first time, but the second time around, I  thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's one of those movies that you shouldn't take  100% seriously, but sit and enjoy the fast action and the special effects  and maybe, just maybe, wonder about this so-called world we live in.  Nah,  really, it is a great movie for entertainment.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2DBWD5OPCJYDS	Deborah Lovelace	The Matrix is a fairy tale of the &quot;coming of age&quot; of the neo-savior hero set within the science fiction genre. It addresses issues such as: Truth is not always reality, and reality is not always truth;  humans as the &quot;alien-other'; and the archetype of death and  resurrection through the spiritual love of femininity as compassion. An  excellent study of archetypes through cross-genre structure.

0790745399	The Matrix	AFEOC3D8WKN1D	Deirdre	"After the death of good science fiction movies in 1994, the genre made a strong comeback with the release of the highly publicized ""The Matrix"". Since then, the film has become a common cultural reference, and copied in the stylization and use of slow motion.It was only recently, on a boring friday, alone in my room with my Xbox, that I finally decided to view ""The Matrix"". I rented it off of Xbox Live, and immediately became sucked in by action sequences I recognized from more recent films, films which no doubt had used the Matrix as a large source of inspiration.The films main strength lies in it's visual appeal. consistently switching between the gritty harshness of the real, machine-ruled world, and the slick, sterilized feel inside the Matrix and other computer programs. The film impliments visual styles never before seen in any film, and created a world, streching the limits of the human imagination.The films second strength, is in it's mind-bending philosophies. What is the true state of existance? Is what you know reality, or simply a veil to a bigger picture. Questions such as these that go wild within the human mind but are never able to be truly communicated with others. The film draws heavily on Christian and Bhuddist philosophies and concepts.Very few times has such a mix of both action and philosophy been but together in film form. Thus creating such an automatic appeal to the viewers.But as with most films, ""The Matrix"" does come with its own flaws. As with many science fiction and action films. These biggest flaws lie in the ending. As with films such as ""Terminator 2"" or ""Iron Man"" the film succumbs to typical ""Spiderman-ish"" cornyness toward its ending, that does not seem fitting with the mature vision the rest of the film contained.Although sequels offer logical reasoning for the over-played sequences toward the end, it still feels as if to little explaination is left to be fully satisfying.One thing that has to be fully understood with the Matrix, is that it is almost completely dependant on its sequels to be complete. Not all is resolved in the end (in fact, not even the main conflict is resolved). It is truly a three-part saga, and is what it should really be viewed as.Science fiction lovers will (and have) found this film to put a fresh perspective on the genre and will love this movie for years to come. Non-geek people will probably enjoy most of it, particularly the concepts which are introduced in the movie.8/10 stars"	4.0	Open your eyes	2009-04-05	3	1	2

Keanu Reeves is great, Carrie Anne Moss is great, Laurence Fishburne is excellent!  The fighting scenes are superb, crazy ""running on the walls"" usually seen in  karate action movies.

Always fun to watch and I have seen this original version several times and enjoy it just as much time after time.Sure makes ya wonder how much money Mr Reeves made off this movie and its sequels......and strange to see Larry Fishburne change his name to Lawrence.....or is it the other way around.

0790745399	The Matrix	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	"What can I possibly say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  There are over three thousand comments at IMDb and another twenty-nine hundred at Amazon.  There even seems to be some block ""reviewing"" from young Christian groups enthusiastically pointing out all the parallels to Christ's life: Neo, ""The One,"" ""Trinity,"" saving humankind, and being lifted up to heaven, etc.  I would add that directors Andy and Larry Wachowski touched some other religious bases as well.  Note that Gloria Foster is ""Oracle"" (Greek mythology), that Lawrence Fishburne is Morpheus (of the Underworld) and that Joe Pantoliano is ""Mr. Reagan"" (a little secular allusion here).  The band of heroes are also referred to as ""freedom fighters"" to recall our ex-prez's words.  (But never mind.)The main thing to understand is that this is one very popular and very arresting movie, the sort of thing Hollywood producers love; in fact all of Hollywood loves The Matrix because it gave work to so many.  Scrolling the credits takes longer than your mother's phone good-bye.  The Matrix is an industry in itself, something like Star Wars and Rambo.But is the movie any good?Well, it's not much on video.  The DVD is undoubtedly an improvement, and on the silver screen it might lean you back in your seat.  The cinematography, sound and special effects are first rate.But I mean philosophically speaking?I think we can get a hint from a review that began (and I quote) ""Why can't all movies be this good? -A 12-year-old viewer.""  Indeed, this is the question all those marketing minds in Hollywood are asking.  The true blockbuster action/adventure/sci-fi movie aims at a male viewer of about 18.  Ideally the range would include 12-year-olds to thirtysomethings.  Any philosophy beyond that mental age is burdensome.So you don't think it is a philosophically interesting movie?Actually I do.  I just don't think it's original.  I mean Plato's cave allegory is over two thousand years old.  And let's not forget The Wizard of Oz (1939) or even The Truman Show (1998).  Any science fiction buff can point to half a dozen precursors.Isn't that stretching it a bit?Okay, how about this short story from half a century or so ago called something like ""The Perm-Machine.""  Everybody in the future society is working their nine-to-five tails off for a TEMP--that is, for a few hours in the box hooked up to the feelie machine complete with 3D screen, surround sound and electrodes attached to your every neuron so that the complete, thrilling, all senses experience of the greatest adventures in life are theirs, including sex, drugs, heart-pounding action and other sensual pleasures.  But what everybody really wanted was a PERM, which would place them in the box permanently hooked up to the electrodes and intravenous drips, etc. for the rest of their lives, a kind of virtual reality heaven on earth.What about the acting?Forget the acting.  It was okay.  Consider this instead: we are going to become software.  There isn't going to be any ""warfare"" between man and machine with the human spirit triumphant.  Instead, we are going to become more and more attached to our machines, our computers, our chips, until at some point (see Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence or Pierre Baldi's The Shattered Self: The End of Natural Evolution) the line between us and machine will be completely blurred.  And then, molecule by molecule, we will DISAPPEAR, and at no time will we even realize it happened!The Matrix is a vision of the future, but it is a hopelessly anthropomorphic vision, a kind of action/adventure director's scan, extrapolated from the present.  Where artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the prospect of quantum computers is taking us cannot be envisioned at all.  Some people call this the ""singularity"" factor.  The future (and by the way, most of the audience of The Matrix will live to see this) is like the horizon of a black hole that we accelerate toward, never able to see beyond that horizon until we are IN."	3.0	An action/adventure future?	2004-09-21	2	1	1
0790745399	The Matrix	ASL92D8708QWL	Dennis R Jackson (djackson@pbs.org)	Absolutely thrilling special effects, great story and awesome music score.  Favorite parts for maximum sound effects are the rescue sequences including the shootout in the lobby of the captive building and the  helicopter crash.  Anyone watching this movie and listening to it through  regular TV speakers are missing more than half of the movie.  Although the  visuals are excellent, the sound heard through a good sound system  including subwoofer cannot be beat.  I live in an apartment and luckily I  don't have complaining neighbors, so I can crank the sound sometimes and I  do it often.  I have watched this movie more than five times already, and  still can't wait to see it again.	5.0	In my opinion, better than Terminator 2 and all other Sci Fi	1999-10-14	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	AZ1H3VLCDR298	Derrick Thomas	I went to see this film knowing nothing about it, thinking it was just a high-tech keanu reeves flick. o, my, god! I was totally blown away from the opening scene. this film is unlike anything I have ever seen before. the effects totally blasted star wars into well-deserved oblivion at the oscars, and Larwrence Fishbourne gave a terrific acting performance. the only downside on the dvd is that in some spots the picture is not that great of quality, especially when they are in the sewers hiding from the robots. other than that, the sound is the best you will hope to find on dolby digital, very good. if you can find the DTS version, pick up that one instead, it's slighty better.

The weak spots are few--even Keanu is good.In the years since it's been out, there's been a lot of discussion about whether this movie is as good as some people think it is, whether it's original, whether it's entertaining.I can't answer that for you--you need to see it for yourself.  For me, this movie brought together a lot of personal questions and actually led me to a place where it was possible to ""free my mind.""It's slick, moody, and arguably original in presentation and content. The acting is great for an action flick. It's worth watching, and like any movie where the cast and crew gave their best effort, it might teach you something.

You must definately see the first Matrix before even attempting to see the sequel.  The matrix creates a different reality that is quite hard to follow if not viewed in order.The Matrix is a sci fi and action adventure movie that breaks the mold- it is beautifully shot, choreographed and filmed.  AT the time of its release, its camera shots were one of a kind and are frequently copied.The matrix stars Keanu Reeves-( i was never a fan of his until this movie.)  He does a brillant job of portraying a computer analyst who is a hacker at night and stumbles onto ""the Matrix"".  His guide into this new world is Morpheus- who is brillantly protrayed by lawrence fishburne.Unlike most films, the Matrix gets better after each viewing as the action is fast paced and there is a lot of intricacy and nuances that you pick up each time you view it.

0790745399	The Matrix	A39OFZXG66L7G3	Devilfish	"Great concept, but as usual Hollywood falls short.  Despite its obvious popularity, I can only say that this is a mediocre movie at best, but a fresh groundbreaking in the western film market nonetheless.  It's the visual effects influenced by Japanese anime that save it.  Everything else is rehashed regurgitated refuse.The first problem is Keanu.  My suspended disbelief came crashing to the tatami mat, as I watched this uncoordinated lanky white guy pretending to know kung-fu.  It was farcical and embarrassing to see Keanu run up the side of a wall and flip in some sort of clumsy slow motion Karate Kid-like kick over Laurence Fishburne.  I give props to Keanu for doing the hard work practicing the moves, but I blame the directors for not hiding his lack of finesse, speed, and agility. (Laurence looked great however.)Also, after Morpheus (Fishburne) did the incredible leap to the distant building, Keanu did his signature ""Whu-oh.""  Did no one else expect him to turn and see Bill or Ted-whichever one he wasn't-from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and say ""Awesome!"" ?That's the only gripe about casting, everyone else were great choices.Besides that and a few other instances of poor direction plus stupid plot devices (could we not have cut out the whole slow paced oracle scene?), there was the drawn out third act. I'm talking about the climax of the whole movie, where the bad androids are tearing into the ship as Trinity tells the incredibly dead Neo how much she loves him. The Wachowski brothers watched Disney's Beauty and the Beast a little too much I think.  When someone is dead, I don't care if you tell them you love them or what, they're not going to come back just to give you a kiss and make everything better and change into Superman.  I'm willing to accept it in a Disney cartoon, not a sci-fi/action flick.  The brothers should have let someone else write the intimate scenes because it comes off as trite and idiotic.  It reminds me of Terminator 2 where Arnold the killing machine asks the boy ""Why do you cry?"".I cry, Arnold, because folks think that poor scenes like this give the movie ""heart"".Regardless, I still think this is a good movie worth the price of admission, I'm just not in love with it enough to fawn over Keanu, ignore the superficial plot, and to type in ALL CAPS."	2.0	Whu-oh!	2001-05-29	45	11	34

0790745399	The Matrix	A20IEO5P43DCRX	"""dgrooves"""	The year is approximately 2199.  The world human beings perceivethrough their senses is an illusion.  Artificially intelligentmachines control all of humanity by altering their perception ofreality through the use of a computer-generated world, called thematrix.  All humans believe they are living in 1999, &quot;the peak ofour civilization&quot;.  The sad fact, however, is that the AI's haveturned humans into a kind of battery, using the energy produced bypeople as fuel.There exist a select few people who have beenremoved from the Matrix and thus exposed to the bleak reality of thereal world.  It is these rebels alone who are fighting to free allhumanity from enslavement.  Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) is theleader of a group of these freedom fighters.  He is also engrossed ina search for the One, a person who has the ability to alter the matrixin any way he sees fit and who will liberate humanity from itsbondage.  Morpheus' search leads him to Thomas Anderson (KeanuReeves), but is Mr. Anderson the One?The Matrix is a feast for theeyes.  The fighting scenes are fast paced and expertly implemented.Each actor spent months learning Hong Kong Kung Fu (&quot;movie KungFu&quot;) and appeared in all of his/her fight sequences, adding ataste of authenticity to the action.  The film also makes use of agroundbreaking filming technique called bullet-time, whereby scenescan be slowed down or sped up and shown from dynamic angles.  Thecombination of fight scenes, camera work, and special effects is thebest to come out of Hollywood for some time and alone warrants aviewing of the Matrix.However, the true beauty of the Matrix cannotbe uncovered in a single viewing.  The Matrix is much, much more thana high-tech, sci-fi action film.  Unfortunately, no one can be toldwhat the Matrix is...This film makes use of a myriad of allusions,&quot;more than you'll ever know&quot; according to the Wachowskibrothers, the writers/directors.  They have drawn upon Christianity,Judaism, Buddhism, Taoism, Western Philosophy (Descartes, Berkeley,...), Eastern Philosophy, Plato, cyberpunk literature (WilliamGibson's work, ...), &quot;traditional&quot; literature (Alice inWonderland, ...), Greek Mythology, and Japanese anime, just to name afew.  The film utilizes all these (and others) sources to explorehumanity's perception of reality, the concept of salvation, andnumerous other philosophical themes.  These themes are too diverse andimportant to discuss in a forum such as this.  Nonetheless, the Matrixwas written with many levels of meaning, exemplified in thecharacter's names, their actions, and their dialogue, to name a fewexamples.All in all, the Matrix was one of the mostthought-provoking and entertaining movies I have ever seen.  It waswell worth the money I spent on it because of one simple word:rewatchability.  This film cannot be appreciated until it is watched anumber of times and each viewing proves to be as rewarding as theprevious one, if not more so.	5.0	&quot;More than you'll ever know&#65533;&quot;	2001-01-25	3	1	2

Sounds corny doesn't it, but his movie actually takes itself very seriously.  'The Matrix' goes around preaching Eastern philosophy like it was its own original idea.  This was one of the worst lines; 'Maybe its not the spoon that is bending but your mind!!'  Whoa, such profound dialogue.  Too bad it was thought up 3000 years ago!!  Later on in the film a woman falls in love with Keanu because it was said she would fall in love with the CHOSEN ONE.  There are plenty of action sequences that go on forever; the worst is when the robots, who are supposed to be flawless, can't shoot the weak human beings.

0790745399	The Matrix	AXYGT3CBHC1WA	DH	It's difficult to review this film without being guilty of quoting a plethora of superlatives.  So were does one start?  Firstly, and I think most significantly, there is more to this movie than meets the eye.  This movie teases the viewer with possible new insights into various philosophical questions facing the human race.  &quot;Oh sure, you don't actually believe this stuff, do you?&quot;  That's not the point really.  What The Matrix does, in addition to giving us an entertainment masterpiece, is nudge our subconscious, and consciously or not, make us pause and think about what this game of life is all about.  How many of us have watched this movie more than once, and just don't get sick of it.  It's engrossing all right, and I'm suggesting it's not just as a result of the entertainment factor.  Well done to the Wachowski brothers.  5 out of 5 on that score. So your not sold on this analysis?  No problem, lets get back to something easier on the mind, superlatives.  Special effects, first rate with some groundbreaking stuff in their.  Stuntwork, simply wicked.  Acting, all round excellence from the cast.  Music score, very appropriate. Script, way out. Action, non stop really and as a bonus the slower scenes are still absorbing. DVD extras, very good. Replayability, unlimited.

(Quote: &quot;Silly and Dense!&quot; Jay Carr, Boston Globe)I thought it was immersive, well thought out and original. Mr Carr here obviously didnt catch on with the storyline. Ok, the first time it took me a little thinking to work out what was oing on too, but once you find out what's going on, you'll love it!!!The critics and I both agree the cast and visual effects are stunning and superb. (Quote: &quot;It's astonishing that so much money, talent, technical expertise...&quot; Bob Graham, San Franciso Chronicle)So, maybe you might find the storyline a bit difficult to follow, but there is no question about the other two major aspects of the film -- the Cast and the Special Effects. Also note that the Matrix received the best special effects award at the oscars (or at someplace else I forgot).If your're still in doubt of whether to buy this or not, read the synopsis carefully, because the plot alone is going to make most people love it or hate it.The extra stuff on the DVD is just icing on the cake, for me.	5.0	Quick, pull up your socks, or The Matrix will knock it off!!	2001-07-08	2	1	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A39PME88IIGPX0	"""djordman"""	For movies, the cyberpunk/virtual reality genre clearly didn't work. Keanu Reeves had already tried it with &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; and - admit it - failed miserably.In 1999, seemingly from out of nowhere, comes &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Neo (Reeves) discovers that humanity's everyday world is in fact a computerised virtual reality, known only as &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The search for answers takes Neo to Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who leads a group of guerilla fighters into a furious battle for freedom! Dazzling special effects, an intriguing story and spectacular action sequences make for a unique experience. You have never - and I mean NEVER - seen anything like this before!I feel I must especially mention Hugo Weaving for his excellent portrayal of the sinister Agent Smith. I don't think I've seen many villains in films that have impressed me more.The Matrix is no longer just a movie. It has become a phenomenon.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2YO1HR9VJJGVN	"""dkf@prodigy.net"""	The special effects in &quot;The Matrix&quot; were spellbinding.  Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne weren't exactly suburb actors in the film, but they weren't exactly bad either.  But I feel this movie lacks one principle that makes a great movie: great writing.  Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus walks Neo (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) through a lot of discussion of what the matrix is, in the middle of the film.  This fits into the category of 'exposition', a definite problem with script writing.  It would have been better if the character Neo would have been involved with more drama while actually figuring out what the matrix is.  In a movie like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the characters are placed in a setting unlike our world...&quot;In a galaxy far, far away.&quot;  The action in &quot;Star Wars&quot; moves from one scene to another without the characters stopping whatever they're doing, then sitting around and explaining how the Millennium Falcon jumps to light speed or how the Death Star destroys planets...the viewer actually sees the stars race across the screen as the Millennium Falcon gets away from the Empire fighters, and see how Princess Lea painfully watches her own planet get destroyed.  In &quot;The Matrix&quot;, besides the long scene that gets bogged down by exposition, there isn't much to character development.  If you take away all the amazing special effects, there wasn't that much in the script to hold the characters together.  I am bothered how this movie is considered a &quot;thinking man's sci-fi thriller&quot;.  After all I just said, I really didn't feel this movie lived up to that promise.	2.0	Great concept - movie fell short on the execution	2001-12-16	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	Winner of two Academy Awards, The Matrix is a perfect ensemble of cast, effects (visual and sound), and story.Keanu Reeves plays Neo, an ordinary human living an ordinary life until he finds out that the life he is living is nowhere near what he or anyone else believes it to be. Through powerful conversations with Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, and Trinity, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, Neo learns that the life of people on Earth is actually a complex system of computer data known as The Matrix, which controls every sense and action known to &quot;man.&quot; Neo does not know what to think about this discovery, nor does he know how to grasp the new and electrifying powers given to him by Morpheus and his small yet stealth crew. Working together, they hope to achieve the one thing that they have been dreaming about: freedom. Freedom does not come easy, for many humans on Earth possess powers superior to that of Morpheus; these people are known as The Agents.When the movie came out in theaters, it received rave reviews, and after seeing the film, it deserved all of them and more. When watching, one must pay close attention to the film, for each minute contains some form of information that is vital to the unfinished plot. The actors in the film are excellent, both with their intellectual dialogue and their playing out of the action sequences. The choreography of the film is stupendous, and fight scenes with and without gunplay looks real and unflawed. Special effects are all the craze for this film, and while most movies have the patented computer-animated look, this is the closest to reality that one can get, tying Independence Day for the best special effects ever in a motion picture. Under superb direction and stellar performances, The Matrix is a thrill-ride into the surrealism of fact vs. reality.The DVD edition of the film boasts superior color fidelity and image sharpness, pleasing the eye with detail for a film that deserves it. Sound design utilizes the .1 LFE channel at almost every turn, engaging especially in gunfight scenes and powerful explosions. The scene in which Neo moves faster than bullets is a remarkable piece of sound effects editing, utilizing the .1 LFE as well as the surround channels. A terrific example of how DVD video should be produced.	5.0	Surreal atmosphere leads the way.	2000-09-21	4	1	3

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	"Well, because this movie hasn't received enough reviews I thought I would add yet another. . .THE MATRIX has so much going for it:  Dynamic, inventive story; an athletic (yet always goofy-looking) Keanu Reeves; tremendous--I would say revolutionary--special effects; a quirky, albeit irreverent, villain in Hugo Weaving; and one of my all-time favorite character actors in Joe Pantoliano.  Plus the film just flows well, and looks so very, very good.So why the three stars?  What the heck is wrong with me?  (Actually, that's a loaded question.)  I've seen THE MATRIX several times, and I still keep bumping my head against problems the film presents.  If our beloved Neo is 'The One' (and by the end of the movie there's no doubt about it) then why all the bothersome inconsistencies leading up to this techno-revelation?  ""No, he can't be The One.""  ""Yes, he must be The One.""  ""No, I'm not The One.""  Gimme a break.  It drips too much of melodrama.  But the sap really runs once (spoiler alert!) Neo is shot by smug Agent Smith, and back on the Mother Ship Neo actually flatlines. . .until Trinity (wow, did Carrie-Anne Moss ever get into shape) whispers in Neo's ear that he can't die, because she's in love with The One--and Neo comes back to life to kick some serious cyber arse.  I just find the whole sequence so mushy I want to go out to the driveway and gargle some gravel.As for the two MATRIX sequels--I've yet to sit through either of them in entirety.  Just too much.  Guess once you've seen Keanu jump off a building--or stop a rushing bullet--there's no point in looking at more of the same.  Maybe I should have taken the blue pill.--D.

Terminator 2 did it in 1990, and the Matrix took it to the next level in 1999.  Other films, such as Romeo Must Die, have tried to duplicate these wonderful effects, but have come up short.  Not only is the Matrix a first in superb visuals and animation, but it is a dang good movie too.If you haven't heard of the Matrix yet, this first installment explains everything.  It might take a few viewings to understand every nook, but once it all fits into place it is a great theme, ""is this world we live in real, or not, and what exactly defines ""real"".  The Matrix will explain it all, in the eyes of Neo (aka Mr. Anderson as Agen Smith likes to call him), from his simple days as another man in the Matrix to becoming unplugged and becoming ""The One"".The story is great.  The characters are top notch and the visuals are to die for.  Many even place this movie into martial arts category, as each fight scene displays true martial arts choreogrpahy intertwined with visual effects of animation.  Truly though, the Matrix is a sc-fi action blast.  Although there is the R rating, I have seen PG-13 films with more questionable content that this film.  Most teenagers and above should be suitable for this.Arguably the best in the trilogy, The Matrix is in my opinion that compared to the other two.  Be sure to watch Reloaded and Revolutions, though not as good in story, the visuals are simplying mind-blowing, only expanding on what the first installment created."	5.0	"""i'm going to enjoy watching you die, mr. anderson."""	2007-06-15	0	0	0

Along comes Trinity played by the fit Carrie-Anne  Moss to recruit Neo to the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar, a hover craft crewed  by a resistance force of humans trying to defeat the control of the  machines. Is Neo the One?, the prophesised hero who will take back control  from the machines, or is he just another guy ? The first half of the film  is all about setting up the sceanario for the second half, Neo taking on  the machines. Full of funky views on what is reality and a fairly grim view  of the future, the Matrix is a movie about the love that grows between Neo  and Trinity while in their struggle with the machines.	5.0	techno lovestory set in a grotty digitally controlled future	2000-08-03	0	0	0

What would you say if your life was a computer simulation? Yes, that's  right.""The Matrix"" is a long, intense roller coaster ride into the  future. What our world is today is a dream world, and The Matrix is the  real world. Keanu Reeves is Neo, who is chosen by the head of a group,  Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). What Morpheus tells Neo is confusing at  first, but at a part where Neo meets someone called The Oracle tells him  something. I won't tell you what; you have to see it for yourself.The  movie doesn't really tell you what The Matrix is directly, but gives you an  implication of what might control the human race in the future.  Technologists think that something called Artificial Intelligence (or AI  for short) will control the way of life, and that is what this movie is all  about. As computers grow stronger, and, what I like to think, more  intelligent, the human race dies down and gets ""sucked"" into them. The very  Internet that you read this on would be nothing compared what it might be  in 1000 years. A Pentium Processor MCMXCVIII, that makes the picture on  your computer pop out into reality? Create an artificial world? What you  believe about the future is the key of life.THE REVIEW:""The Matrix""  is not one of those ordinary action films...terrorist threatens, guy saves  whatever or whoever is in danger, or those ""Save the [Insert Subject Here]""  type things (Well, maybe it is a little like saving the world). But is very  different. That's why it got 4 1/2 out of five. An ordinary guy, Thomas  ""Neo"" Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is picked out by Morpheus (Laurence  Fishburne), the head of a team that tries to overthrow an evil Matrix to  save the new one. The special effects are great. (I don't know if ""Flo-Mo""  is trademarked by the Wachowski brothers or not) What I mean by ""Flo-Mo"" is  the so-called ""Bullet Time"" sequence, where Neo dodges bullets. Also, I  can't imagine the vigorous training that went into performing the Kung Fu  and other karate moves. This is the first movie of its kind that the REAL  actors do their own moves. This movie should be a big hit across the  Pacific. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity) were a great pair-up  for this movie. It is hard to explain the movie in a review, because there  isn't anything to review other than the theme of the story, but it was  good. It is probably the best science fiction movie I've seen. The movie is  based on playing a game on the computer, about virtual reality. So, what is  The Matrix?

This movie has been out for only two years, and yet the influence is all over the place, not just in the movies, but on TV as well.  For example, one of the major tv networks employs a &quot;Matrix-style&quot; screen of scrolling numbers as its segway between live football action and replay analysis or other features of a football broadcast.  It's not uncommon to see the &quot;bullet-time&quot; effect that was created for &quot;The Matrix&quot; in other movies that have been released since.  &quot;The Matrix&quot;, as Orpheus so aptly says, is all around is.But enough about it's influence - this movie absolutely rocks!!  The soundtrack keeps your heart racing a mile a minute.  The special effects will blow you away.  And as if that isn't enough, the story is so fresh and such a great idea, you are left wondering how they thought of it, and maybe even thinking to yourself, 'Is the Matrix real?'  This movie is the real deal.  Even if you're not a Keanu Reeves fan, you'll still love this flick.  He fits the role well, and although his acting has never really been that great, he does a more than adequate job in this instant classic.If you want action through and through, this is the movie for you.  If you don't have a home theater system, this movie is a reason to get one.

0790745399	The Matrix	AKHURFB0ZAJZF	"""drrg99"""	"The matrix is definitely one the of the best movies I have ever seen.  The action was amazing, the plot magnificent, and the characters were well suited to their parts and their acting was stupendous.  However there is a lot more to this movie than meets the eye.Several days ago when I was watching the movie I was surprised how the story-line of the movie parallels that of the bible.  First of all is Neo who would resemble Jesus.  Neo is born in the fake world,  is ""re-born"" by 'morpheus', and through his death and resurrection is able to overcome the matrix and defeat the AGENTS(the devil) finalize what he is.  Morpheus is like John the Baptist who is in a sense ""preparing the way for the ONE"".  Another similarity I found was the old matrix and EDEN.  The old matrix was a perfect place but humans rejected it and were then forced to work and toil for the rest of their lives in misery and pain.  I think it is also ironic how Neo kills the main AGENT in the end of the movie.  The agent dies with his arms spread out in mockery of Jesus on the cross.I've heard of many other parallels within Christianity and many other religions as well.  It just makes you wonder if it was all a giant fluke or if the producer and storywriters of the matrix had something deeper in mind. Just keep that in mind the next time you watch it.  Maybe you'll find some other parallels as well."	5.0	An amazing DVD.... but the plot goes deeper!!	2002-09-30	3	1	2

I think I could watch this movie pretty close to a thousand times in a row without being board.  This is not just an action, thriller.  This is deep and brilliant.I don't think, the plot ever really had what I would call a twist it was just so unpredictable the obvious seemed invisible; this script is genius.The action was powerful.  I can't think of any other word that really says what I want.  It was so stunning, so gripping, so real, so powerful...I haven't seen all the actions out there now, but without even really seeing half of them I feel like I could easily say: This is the best action yet in world history.And the special effects are stunning, and the entire creation of the scenery is again amazing.  Things like colors that were used to portray sadness and happiness.  I can't tell you all of the stuff you really should just watch it for yourself.And for you message people.  The message behind this movie is simply so incredible.  I think I should say messages.  I won't even go into it now.  I just want to say again.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2TXR85WQLE32N	D. S. Thurlow	"1999's ""The Matrix"" wed ground-breaking special effects to a highly original sci-fi concept, propelling a capable cast through a unique journey to another reality.""The Matrix"" opens with Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, software technician by day, computer hacker by night, in search of a sign that will lead to meaning in his life.  A sign does come, over his computer, leading him to a momentous meeting with Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne), who challenges his understanding of reality.  Before he even has a chance to digest Morpheus' revelation, Neo is arrested by agents of a shadowy government agency.  His rescue by Morpheus and his companions, including Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss), leads Neo to two stunning realizations: that the reality in which he has been living is a computer-generated fraud called the Matrix, and that he has a destiny beyond his existance in that computer-generated world.Neo's journey toward understanding of his destiny will take him through a series of exciting adventures in and out of cyber-space, toward a violent confrontation with Agent Smith, the snarling leader of those who protect the illusion of the Matrix.  Along the way, the viewer will be treated to some spectacular kung fu sequences as Neo learns to use his new powers, and the famous and visually stunning shootout in multiple dimensions in the lobby of a building where Neo and Trinity go to rescue Morpheus.This movie is highly recommended as a quantum leap forward in the special effects of the day, and as an exciting science fiction story."	5.0	Journey to Reality...Through the Mirror	2007-07-18	1	1	0

I mean, it was a real good movie with a good concept that makes you think, but I thought it was too detailed for someone to take in all in one shot and I found it to be overwhelmingly confusing at times.  It also moved too fast and explained things a little too fast.  If you haven't seen it yet, buy it, but it's one of those movies where you have to pay attention.	4.0	4.5 stars.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1ZSOK69XSXF73	"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic"""	"You may be wondering what exactly I mean by that title.  What I mean is that it's widely-believed that the Matrix is one of the best sci-fi action films ever made.  Oh what a grand lie that is.  By the time you're done reading this review, you'll know that the Matrix is NOT original, intelligent, thought-provoking, or even that entertaining.PLOTThe plot is that in a not-too-distant future, a software technician by day and computer hacker by night named Tom Anderson (day identity)/Neo (night identity) (Keanu Reeves) is tracked down by two mysterious people named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) and soon finds himself learning that the world he's known is all a lie and he's the one ""destined to free the human race.""CHARACTERSThe characters in this movie are pretty dull.  Aside from all the people still ""plugged"" into the Matrix, even the people that are ""freed"" don't seem to have much emotion or personality.  Because of this, it's pretty hard to care what happens to them.LACK OF ORIGINALITYAgain, I don't mind a lack of originality as long as the final product is well-done and has enough unique nuances to have it stand up on its own.  Much like how the horrendous Dark City is an extremely uninspired cocktail of elements taken from Akira, Total Recall, Metropolis, and The Addams Family, The Matrix is an extremely uninspired cocktail of elements taken from Ghost in the Shell, Total Recall, and various Hong Kong action films.  In other words, it's like the Wachowski brothers just ripped off a bunch of other peoples' works so they didn't have to create anything on their own.Examples of this intense derivative nature is that with Ghost in the Shell, it's like the style of opening credits animations were lifted right out of GITS, and even towards the end of the film, there's a shoot-out between Neo and one of the Agents by an bunch of Asian-styled street-side markets that's very reminiscent to the one in GITS.When Tom/Neo goes through all the trouble to evade the Matrix Agents in his workplace, it feels way too much like Doug Quaid's escape from Cohaagan's henchmen near the beginning of Total Recall (Dark City would be another movie to rip off this TR element).I can keep going on here, but I think you get the picture.HOKEY ACTINGThe only actors I though were putting any effort in his roles or were at least entertaining were Lawrence Fishburne and Joe Pantoliano.  It seems like everyone else either acted stiffly or was over-acting.  Reeves is the most guilty of this, because so much of the time he's on the screen without any charisma or worse, when he's trying to be more dramatic, he comes off like William Shatner.  Joe Pantoliano as Cypher at least had some eagerness on screen and cracked the only somewhat amusing line in the whole movie, which was ""Better strap in, Dorothy, because Kansas, is going bye-bye!!""  Carrie-Anne Moss felt really flat when she was on screen, and most of the others are guilty of this.LACK OF INTELLIGENT CONTENTDespite all the movie's attempts at coming off as an intelligent movie that will leave you thinking long after the movie is over, they're more like window dressings to cover up the fact that there isn't much beneath the surface of overstaged fights and tacky ""bullet time"" gun fights.  First, there's the rather silly choice to give the protagonists names like Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, Cypher, and the naming of Morpheus's ship the Nebuchadnezzar.  To me, they come off as loose references to ancient Greek mythology and Biblical locations that add up to nothing else other than for the sake of having them in order to make the movie look ""culturally-developed.""  Second, the references to Alice in Wonderland and Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation don't add up to anything that will make you think when the movie is over.  It seems like the movie uses exposition about everything that happens and with any ""spiritual"" mumbo jumbo so that you don't have to mentally work for the film.  Overall, given how hokey-feeling and convoluted the movie feels, it's nearly impossible to take seriously.SOUNDTRACKDon Davis's score for the Matrix is okay, nothing terrible, but nothing special.  However, I must deeply scorn the Wachowski brothers's choice to add in such banal 90's music from the likes of Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, the Deftones, Rob Zombie, and Rage Against the Machine.  They should have been much more adventurous and tried to get to use music from underground bands like Godflesh and Front Line Assembly (these bands create far more daunting music that's far more appropriate for cyberpunk media).BORING ACTION SCENESNow you're probably asking ""Can you at least acknowledge that the action scenes are cool?""  Well, I'd like to be merciful in this area, but not even the action scenes make this movie entertaining.  The ""bullet time"" effects have been heavily-lauded and imitated since the Matrix's release, but despite the fact that I know why this effect exists in the Matrix, it just looks too silly and just feels more like a way for the special effects teams to show off their skills than to create any riveting visuals.  Also, despite the fact that some protagonists face some grave, believable danger in the film, I honestly didn't feel much tension during these scenes because of how bland the characters are.FINAL WORDThe Matrix is merely a jejune, bloodless sci-fi/action film that fails at both being thought-provoking or entertaining.  If you want sci-fi and sci-fi/action films that are either thought-provoking or entertaining (both with some), check out these much superior films.AlienAliensBlade RunnerAkiraGhost in the ShellThe TerminatorRobocopTotal RecallPaprikaPredatorSolaris (1972 Tarkovski film, not the 2002 remake with George Clooney)Stalker2001:  A Space OdysseyTHX-1138Leave this derivative, poisonous pap on the store shelves."	1.0	One of the greatest lies of cinema history.  19%	2012-05-16	35	9	26

0790745399	The Matrix	A1DU8DCU3JT78Q	"Dustin Martinez ""Saint Gasoline"""	"The Matrix is one of those movies that is only as good as you make it. Analyzing just the bare bones story, we have nothing more than a pseudo-religious allegory, in which Christ (Neo) becomes resurrected in order to save mankind from an illusory reality, perhaps ushering mankind into some Platonic realm of true essences and Forms and souls--whatever you'd prefer to call it. But even when horrid stories attempt to become allegories, the fun of interpretation renders the movie watchable. For all intents and purposes, however, The Matrix is not a *bad* movie. It is not a great movie, either. But those viewers willing to put something into the movie are going to walk away with a much more satisfying movie-watching experience.There is so much symbolism, so many implications, so much intended meaning to dispute here! What is reality? Morpheus can't even answer this, offering the tentative definition that it *can* be defined as electrical impulses in our brain. But that, of course, can't be correct--for then the Matrix is just as ""real"" as Neo's ultimate arrival in ""wonderland"". Indeed, it is funny that Morpheus would refer to his idea of reality as wonderland.Who are the enemies? The machines seem more than simple robots. They are sentient beings, using humans in much the same way humans had intended to use them. While the viewers, being human, are tempted to see the inversion of this reality as the ""right"" one, it would still be, logically, just as immoral. If we are justified in enslaving sentient machines, then why are not sentient machines justified in enslaving sentient biological organisms? And then there are so many more questions! How do we determine whether a thing is a machine? The flying, superhuman Neo the viewer is looking up to and cheering for, after all, is nothing more than a digital representation, no more a ""real person"" than the agents he is fighting! And if the ""reality"" is to preferred to the simulation, why does the movie center on the simulation? We glorify the heroics of some digital representation, when the real Neo is strapped into a chair, or cowering on some crusty ship eating white sludge. The values we are expected to hold are actually inverted by the movie-watching experience, with its explicit endorsement of escapism in its fantasy realm, with its emphasis of the glory attained in the fantasy world rather than the harsh existence of Neo's reality.And why accept the man/machine distinction, anyway? The agents are capable of emotion, as one snarls that humans are nothing more than a virus destroying the world. And the humans are little more than machines as well. They have SOCKETS in their arms and heads. Programs can be DOWNLOADED into their brains. After an intense session of downloading programs into Neo, the operator exclaims, ""He's a machine."" Ah, but if he is a machine, he is the enemy!I could go on and on like this. I could tell you why Cypher is the real hero, and why Neo is an antichrist. I could explore the religious allegory with more detail. I could explore the philosophical implications, the metaphysical questions roused by the movie. But that would take up pages upon pages.It should be obvious, then, that this decent movie is indeed worthy of four stars when one invests some effort in analyzing its themes and symbols. With an unbiased, ""objective"" viewing, it is a three star movie at best--but that's not the way I viewed it. The extra star is thus masturbatory, a reward not for the movie, but for the pseudo-intellectual fluff it allows me to spout after an analysis."	4.0	Reality's Wonderland	2006-01-30	1	0	1

How many movies since The Matrix have you seen similar effects shots being used, a  lot. I did like Episode 1 to, but the Matrix did all its effects with live  actors which makes it that more impressive.The story is just great. It  really makes you wonder about reality, but its more entertaining than  anything. Its hard to get bored of this movie, I have seen it many times  now and i still could go see it again and enjoy it. Definetly worth adding  to your dvd collection.There are also some neat special addons to this  dvd, showing how they did a lot of the special effects in the movie, it is  really interesting.	5.0	My favorite movie of 1999	2000-05-22	0	0	0

I don't get it.  Anyway, this is a great film and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It's exiting as it get's.  This movie will remain a gem in your collection.  Good disk all in all.  The commentary is my opinian wasn't that good.  It would have been better if Keanu Reeves was in the commentary.  And don't worry if your going to let your kids watch it, cause it isn't bad what so ever.  So grab your kids even if they're 5 years old and watch it with them.  They'll love it like my 5 year old, 8 year old and 11 year old did.  It is a very confusing movie thou.  The other ones in the series aren't as confusing because you learn everything from this one.  This one is my second favorite in the series.  Here's the order I like the Matrix movies 3,1 and then 2.  Yes, you may think I'm weird for liking the third one the best it's just that the first didn't have enough action, the second was a bit too phoney, but third was just action to the max.  I can't wait untill they realese a Matrix Trilogy box set.  I'll be one of the first to buy that.	5.0	Great Film	2004-03-14	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A18CA0GRHDVP8X	Earl Hazell	The comparisons of THE MATRIX to  STAR WARS, as paradoxically odd and fitting as that maybe, are now I'm sure as legendary as the movie itself.  Yet it cannot be said enough for a powerful reason.There is a new paradigm of thought in town, bringing us in to the 21st century with both precedented and unprecedented power, grace and style.  In psychology in the earlier part of the 20th century, Jung the spiritualist/linguist so upset the applecart of Freud the biologist that it ushered in a whole new way to see humanity--respecting and including the ones that came before it in its new perspective.  But Stanislov Grof, with his scientific mysticism, jumped so far beyond Jung that he makes him look like early Freud in comparison, and as such prepares us for the 21st century.  Equally and similiarly, before the seventies, one can see the plethora of movies influenced by the Freudian perspective on human life and Western Culture (think Hitchcock), and their often amazing quality and insight.  George Lucas, however, building on that Jazz mystic Stanley Kubrick, decided to come along and do an Ali (&quot;I'll shake up the World!!!!!!&quot;) and give us a Jungian anthropological/mythological masterpiece underneath innovative special effects, changing movie making forever.  There was really almost nowhere new to go in science fiction or action movies in their entirety after STAR WARS...until the Wachowski Brothers, like Grof to Jung, showed us directly what Lucas hinted at cryptically: INNER Space is the only space.STAR WARS, after the several years we needed to catch on, allegorically introduced the geater world to the symphonic poetry of the Post-Jungian Mythographer and genius Joseph Campbell. THE MATRIX reintroduces us to the myth and mysticism that still forms the foundation of our culture and consciousness, as Campbell said, but in the context of *Michael Talbott* (see the book, THE HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE): the quantum leap above and beyond Jung and Campbell for our post-Einstein time.  And it does so in a way that will be the standard for all myth-making and story-telling in Hollywood for quite some time, I'm sure.  Yet like all great movies, knowing why it is so great doesn't stop you from enjoying it.  Neither does seeing it a bunch of times!  There is something new to mine from this movie every time you see it, because of the divine truths it thematically and metaphorically underscores.Naturally, you can't ignore the obvious: the special effects and cinematography are from another planet.  The fight choreography is the closest thing to ballet before CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON (and by the same fight choreographer). Laurence Fishburne is, well, Laurence Fishburne (any OTHELLO fans out there, with Kenneth Branaugh as Iago?). And, saints be praised, this is also one of the few movies that Keanu not only didn't stink in (and that's coming from someone who liked SPEED and POINT BREAK and THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE and so on), but used his limited acting technique to transcend its own limitations and egolessly tell the story better than anyone could have.  But the trick is that all of the above could have sucked with a script as powerful as this one--because of it being so masterfully written--and the movie would have still been wonderful.  The script brings out all of the above mentioned spritual themes, in a way that an eleven year old (like my son) could click on to, but not even a brain surgeon (like Pribram?) or an astrophysicist (like Bohm?) could ignore.  This is the real reason why you can watch this movie 16 times and still see it again as if it was the first.Own this.  This and *PI*--another wonderful independent film that heralds the discovery of the secret worlds of INNER space--are the New Testament of Science Fiction for me; maybe for all movie making for this new century.	5.0	Classic; A New Paradigm for Science Mythology over Sci-Fi	2001-11-09	5	2	3

One, the steak being eaten by Cipher just looks extraordinary.  Juicy, well presented, and when Cipher puts it in his mouth, Sticky's mouth was well.. sticky.But the great thing about it was Cipher's subversive comment about the steak.  He notes that even though he realises he's not eating a steak he still loves it ie. &quot;Ignorance is bliss&quot;And Sticky agrees that's a wonderful metaphor for Sticky Rice, well cooked steak in movies, clever packaging for DVDs and Ben Affleck's sick laugh.	4.0	Steak - Yum!	2002-03-04	6	1	5

The Matrix also asks the questions, &quot;what if you woke up one day, and your life as you knew it was never truly a real life?&quot; I really don't like to give too much away when telling people about the Matrix because I've found out that when you tell them about the story, they always come back with, &quot;that's O.k. I've seen Dark City before&quot;.Don't get me twisted, Dark City is very good, but the Matrix is really different from it. This one won't disappoint you at all.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1FG3A3V5IAEG9	"E. Frampton ""Parandot"""	The Matrix is a very entertaining movie.  It has great martial arts sequences and John Woo inspired gun sequences.  The story of this movie is solid and very intriguing.  The dialogue is where this movie stumbles horribly.  The philosophical lines are just horrendous.  Example:  &quot;I can only show you the door, you're the one that has to walk through it.&quot;  This trite nonsense just takes away from the action.  These one-liners are sprinkled through out the movie.  You may say I have to lighten up, but great dialogue could have made this movie perfect.  The story is there, the acting is there, and the action sequences are there.  The influence of this movie can already be seen.  The wire work is extensively used in other movies, such as Charlies Angels.  I saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and I have to say The Matrix just doesn't cut it.  Well-worth seeing more than once, but just don't listen to what the characters are saying.	4.0	Philosophical Action	2000-11-08	1	1	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A38HB61OL61QIT	Eirinn G. Cunningham	"The Matrix is a pivotal film in the history of film.  While that may seem overstated, The Matrix deserves every ounce of acclaim it has garnished over the years. Before this film, we didn't truly know action could be so good!Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a mundane computer geek who lives an equally mundane existence. Until he takes an unexpected trip down the rabbit hole.  Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the legendary man who is only whispered about by the kind of people Neo knows, contacts him and offers him a choice: Learn what the Matrix is, or stay in your regular old life and remain unfulfilled.He asks, ""Did you ever have a dream you were so sure was real?""  The philosophical influences in the Matrix are obvious to anyone familiar with works of  Descartes.  Neo chooses to learn what the Matrix really is, and that's when the fun really begins. Trinity (Carrie- Ann Moss) kicks some serious butt.  Neo finds out the truth is scarier than fiction, and that reality is never what it seems to be.  Love soon develops between Neo and Trinity, but not before Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) steps in to try to stop any hope from triumphing in a world dominated by killer machines.

0790745399	The Matrix	AEI234MC2NC17	E. Kelly Fairless (ekelly@oneimage.com)	The Matrix (VHS), while jam packed with state-of-the-art F/X, relies upon a gripping story, characters who actually grow, and the classic unfolding of the Hero's Journey for its impact.  I had to watch it twice to see it  once.  Some of the cinematic elements remind me at once of Ridley Scott's  Blade Runner and Disney's Tron.  The plot itself is a hipper, more  thoughtful and logical extension of questions raised in those films about  the nature of reality and how manipulation of reality forms human society.  The awesome special effects and kung-fu coreography provide eye-candy to  accompany a meaty, soul-food fable about the search for Truth and the  journey towards self-knowledge. As Neo awakens to the nature of the reality  he thought he knew, the viewer awakens with him.  The message here is that  we can accept everything at face value and be comfortable, or we can take  the more hazardous course and question it all.  The price of comfort is  nothing less than our humanity.  The price of maintaining our humanity is  to sacrifice comfort and safety for something greater than ourselves.  Matrix owes as much to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness as it does to  &quot;cyber-punk&quot; fiction.  It is thoughful and thought-provoking,  thrilling to watch and enthralling to contemplate.  In case you couldn't  tell, I really liked this flick.  I don't know if it likes me.	5.0	Coming of Age tale that shatters the boundaries of genre.	1999-10-07	0	0	0

How utterly original, how truly amazed I am every single time I watch  it. It is a movie that can sit in the background of a party, on multiple tv's and everyone is in tune with it. Visually brilliant and the sound is bar none. If you couldn't follow this one, or could not keep up with  the fast paced and intricate plot, well then do not say you are too 'American' for a film such as this like the reviewer below. How shallow is that; instead go rent Fantastic Four, that should be trite, unmoving and American enough for you.Matrix is one of the greatest, and always will be.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1OCOT9XQ1FBSW	El Jimmy	"For those of you like myself who can care less about Reloaded and Revolutions, this is the movie for you. I always thought The Matrix was a great stand alone movie by itself. The other two lacked in originality and story, and I bypass the two all the time.  The Matrix was so unique, revolutionizing film forever, doing things never been done or tried before. The movie looks excellent in HD, made for the HD format. One of my favorites!And anyone interested in the ""other"" Matrix movie, pick up the new director's cut of Dark City on BluRay, which came out a year before The Matrix, which storyline is almost identical, and they even share some of the same sets for both movies.  Rumor is both Dark City, directed by Alex Proyas (who directed The Crow) and The Matrix had Brandon Lee set to star as Murdock/Neo but obviously that was not possible due to his sudden death.  The Murdock and Neo characters are identical that they are anomalies, The Strangers and Agents similar, and Smith is identical to Mr. Hand, Kiefer Sutherland's character similar to Morpheus, so on and so forth. Some would even go as far as saying that the Wachowski brothers ripped-off the idea from Dark City for the original Matrix, and that Reloaded and Revolutions were truly their work and thats why it wasn't as good.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1MGNCVS67UNPG	"""ender160"""	An intense plot, incredible music, extraordinary acting and stunning visuals are combined to create one of the most impressive science fiction movies out there. While the visuals are, for lack of a better word, simply awesome, the reason this movie was so popular was because of the philosophical plot. You only really start to understand the great number of metaphors the second time through (unless, of course, someone spoiled the main plot prior to your first viewing). As juvenile as it seems, the action scenes themselves are so impressive that even if a decent story was lacking from the movie (which is most certainly not true) it would still be worth a viewing. The amazing soundtracks add so much to the intense, suspense filled movie. And all of this has not even come close to scratching the surface.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1ZYZ5853ZADZA	Eric Johnson	In a summer that was supposed to be dominated by the new Star Wars movie, The Matrix took everyone by surprise.  The trailers that I saw for it promised some cool looking effects and possibly a pop  philosophy/existentialist subtext.Never before have I gone into a movie  with expectations that were at a level so far below the level of the movie  as I did for this one.  This is one of the best movies to come out in a  long time.I'll begin with the effects.  Bluntly put, this movie  represents the biggest jump in effects since a blue screen was first used.  The creation of 'bullet time' allowed the 360 degree filming of stilled  subjects.  This is the greatest effect that I have seen in a long time.  It's possibilities are endless.  The movie's use of it in fight sequences  made the fights better than most any I've ever seen.  The only ones that  are better are for sentimental reasons or pure skill, but the sequences in  the Matrix look better than anything.This movie is also very full of  style.  Everyone is got up in black and wears sunglasses.  You might think  that this would seem gimmicky, but it works.  Black trenchcoats have never  looked better.As for the movie itself, the plot and subtext is  phenomenal.  You could teach a Philosophy 101 course based on the themes  brought up in this movie.  It has everything ranging from Utilitarianism  and Hedonism to Nietzsche and the basic questions of metaphysical  exploration.  Even if you ignore all of this, on the surface it's a great  Sci-fi/Action movie.  The gunfights are great and Keanu is actually a good  cast.  Laurence Fishburne was a perfect cast for Morpheus and Carri-Ann  Moss was great.If you get this, go for the Widescreen version.  Otherwise, you miss so much.  Definitely get this movie.	5.0	5 stars is nowhere near enough!	2000-07-19	3	2	1

I refer to the fact that humans do not produce any kind of energy; we, like all organisms, consume energy in endothermic processes.  So, if one were connect a whole bunch of us together in a giant farm, one would get a net energy consumption and a whole bunch of fertilizer.I am only person I personally know who hated this movie, but the other people I personally know who saw it are children.

The sound effects in this movie absolutely raise  the bar for any action or sci-fi movie from here on out.  My personal  favorite is the shell casings, in EVERY scene they are absolutely crystal  clear and really bring home the impact of the different gun  battles.2)The effects!  Similar to the sound, there will be a new genre  of special effects spawning from what they came up with for this movie  (there's already evidence of this out there, anyone see the preview for the  new IMAX Michael Jordan movie?).On the whole the story is great, with  some minor flaws in the logic behind the matrix that I  won't bother with  because this movie absolutely ROCKS.Go out and buy a worthy surround  sound setup, *get this DVD* and turn it up loud enough to bother the  neighbors...

0790745399	The Matrix	A2SRZQU1SZG4RR	"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower"""	This is one of the all time best &amp; most creative future fantasy events on film!!! Human beings are trapped within a computer program called &quot;The Matrix&quot;. In essence, that which was created, &quot;the computer program&quot;, artificial intelligence and machines, becomes the ruler and human beings are imprisoned within it. The concept and meaning of &quot;freedom&quot; takes on a whole new dimension. Neo, a young man in his late twenties, takes a ride in a car in 1999 and is held captive, at gun-point. He goes to a run-down building where he is introduced to &quot;Morpheus&quot;. Morpeus gives him a choice: select a blue or red capsule ... choose the &quot;the blue one&quot;, continue to live within the dream ... choose &quot;the red one&quot; and experience &quot;REALITY&quot;. Neo chooses the red one and the trip to the future begins ... complete with allusions to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. There is a scene where Neo is  sliding down a futurisitic tunnel, strangely resembling a laundry shoot.The three main themes in the film are1) humans have created computers, machines which become the rulers,i.e. control human beings. It seems like a forewarning ...2) find your own path, get in touch with your belief system,remain true to your values,3) freedom means taking a chance, not knowing the outcome. It is sets human beings apart from the rest of creation. Taking risks, not knowing the future, THIS IS LIFEThere are phenomenal scenes involving kung fu and ju jitsu ... the realm of getting in touch with one's inner self is explored. There is an &quot;esoteric&quot; side throughout the film. When Neo is to meet with &quot;the Oracle&quot; a prophetess, Morpheus says words to this effect to Neo: &quot;I can show you the door. Feel your mind.  I can only show you how - you are the one who has to walk through it.&quot; Another memorable statment is &quot;To deny our own impulse is to deny the very thing that makes us human&quot;. In another scene there is a young boy, who looks like he is within a Zen temple, bending spoons through with his mind or thoughts. The youngster says to Neo: &quot;Do not try to bend the spoon. Only realize there is no spoon. You will realize, it is you that is bending  ... not the spoon.&quot; When a human being dies within the computer program ... their physical body dies, too. The reason given  &quot;without the mind, the body is dead.&quot; One of the Agents named Smith, says to Neo: &quot;Every mammal on the planet develops balance, except human beings, you consume and mulitply ... there is only one other organism that does that ... a virus. Human beings are a disease&quot;. Essentially it is a warning, do not get so out of balance,out of touch with reality, that you destroy yourself, and the planet ...This thoroughly enjoyable film has artistic, entertainment and philosophical/humanistic value. It explores many facets of human behavior and the meaning &amp; purpose of life. Highly recommended. Erika Borsos (erikab93)	5.0	Surrealistic Future: Reality &amp; Fantasy Mix	2003-08-01	1	1	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A1EY864NYPSD9D	ErikJ@aol.com	Although many found the concepts hackneyed, the acting stilted and the action sequences borrowed, I say, let them think that, they're letting analysis and higher thinking get in the way of what is one of the most  enjoyable movie watching experiences I can call to mind.  The plot,  although it has its holes, is engaging and complex, and even  semi-spiritually based.  The action sequences are, IMHO, thrilling and  exquisite.  The effects are unmatched.  And the acting, again IMHO, is  GREAT.  I am NOT a Keanu fan, far from it, but I enjoyed his performance  thoroughly, and Fishburne was great as well.  The bottom line is, if you're  going to watch this with the intent of tearing apart, you'll have plenty of  handholds.  But, if you watch this ready to suspend disbelief and have a  EXCEPTIONALLY good time, then that is most certainly what you'll  experience.  This is in my top 5 favorites now, and I consider myself  fairly discriminating, although definitely a &quot;common man&quot; in my  tastes (Raising Arizona, Vertigo, The Princess Bride, The Crow and Pulp  Fiction are other favorites of mine, as a point of reference.)Add to  that the fact that the DVD will have commentaries, behind-the-scenes clips,  documentaries, still galleries, and a DVD-ROM internet event in November,  and what you have here is one INCREDIBLE deal for a mere $15.  Best money  you could spend, this is a SHOWCASE DVD title.	5.0	Absolutely stunning	1999-08-06	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A36LQAUTMBBTRK	Erik Olson	If you choose this movie hoping to see non-stop action, you might be a little disappointed. While The Matrix boasts a number of shoot-'em-up, kick-'em'-in-the-head battle scenes further illuminated by the next wave in  special effect technology, this movie also a number of thought-provoking  questions as to the nature and existence of reality itself.The action  gives the film its blockbuster appeal, but the meat of the story lies in  the philosophy behind it. I read in the newspaper that a college somewhere  in the eastern U.S. taught a class about The Matrix's philosophy on  reality. If you're not looking for something that will challenge your own  world view, this movie's not for you.But if you want something that both  makes your heart race and the wheels of your mind turn, accept no  substitute.

0790745399	The Matrix	AEE6FCMV9U4FO	Evan B Tow	Yes,You're thinking i'm some moron who doesn't know what i'm talking about... But guess what? I do.  Its amazing - most people think this is the  best film ever... its really sad.  This is my opinion - however, if you  look a little closer after what I just said - you'll realize, that The  Matrix isn't all that, and used fx to cover the &quot;been done  before&quot; script, and a few plot holes...Anyway, here we go.  *Spoilers*We already know that most of the movie ripped off &quot;Dark  City&quot;, &quot;Lawnmower Man&quot;, and of course  &quot;Metropolis.&quot;  The movie seems a little &quot;too&quot;  identical to them...  Take Dark City for example - In that movie, we see  bad guys talking about how they really hate their kind... Matrix also does  that.  D. City was written before Matrix... The Professional also known as  Leon' had their ending stolen, which was surprising - because some of it  looked like it was &quot;from shot to shot.&quot; There are more movies  then just Dark City that have been ripped off, people - ignore the fx - and  almost watchable performances, and chances are you're gonna see a story -  that has been done a number of times.This is also my favorite - I was  impressed with the new camera angles, and special fx... However, with two  years of training for the kung fu fights  - you would think they could have  done a better job... Keanu can't fight, obviously can't act - and I did  &quot;not&quot; pay $7.50 to see him say &quot;whoa.&quot;  And if you  think the bullettime (dodging) scenes were new... guess again - They are  also done (with arrows) in John Woo's Hard Target.  The staircase sequence  (in the opening) has been done before and a lot better in John Woo's A  Better Tomorrow II... hmm... you know - all the action styles have been  stolen from Mr. Woo... Its really sad.  The Whackowski Brothers should know  better then to take from Mr. Woo, because he is always one step ahead -  creating something bigger, better, and utterly breathtaking.The only  &quot;good&quot; acting in this movie was from Lawrence Fishburne...  everyone else was really laughable! The soundtrack was very nice, and Don  Davis's score was actually decent.  But, sadly thats about it - and for  other plot holes, that I didn't mention - check out imdb.com , they  actually show one that is very noticable (if you ignore the fx)... see - FX  can't make a movie. I'm sure, what you're thinkin is - i've heard many  people say this crap and don't know what they are talking about... but -  guess what, why don't you rent some of the other Sci-Fi films, and John Woo  films that I mentioned - chances are you'll notice that the only saving  grace of The Matrix was just fx and hype.	2.0	Over-rated, Unoriginal, Poor Acting, Poor Action - Nice FX..	2000-09-19	11	5	6
0790745399	The Matrix	A2RIRJJPGPMM8N	Everyone's_a_critic	"I know it's been a million years and thousands of reviews later, but something has always mystified me about this movie. It's something that Trinity says to Neo in the subway station. She says she wants to tell him something, but she is afraid of what will happen if she does. The movie never made it clear what she was talking about! I went to every matrix forum I could find and the question is raised many times... but never fully addressed. Here is my attempt to answer the question once and for all. :>-------------In the first Matrix film, after Neo saved Trinity from the helicopter crash, the pair were in the subway station waiting for the phone to ring in order for Trinity could jack-out. Just before Agent Smith appears Trinity says to Neo: ""Neo, I want to tell you something, but I'm afraid of what it will mean if I do. Everything the Oracle told me has come true...everything but this."" She hesitates, and then Smith shows up to kill them and interrupts her.What did Trinity mean? What had the Oracle told her? Why was she scared to tell Neo? The film never made this clear.A common explanation is that Trinity was afraid to tell Neo she was in love with him. This does not wash however. In her phrasing, Trinity distinguished what had already come true (""has come true"") from what had not yet to come true. Clearly at this point in the film she was in love with Neo. He had just bravely risked his own life to save hers, and in fact she is hinted at being in love with him, as well as knowing he was The One before they even awoke him. So there is something else, something that has not yet happened, that makes her allude to ""everything but this"", with ""this"" being a reference to something she was about to tell Neo that had not yet come to pass.A twist on the above premise is that Trinity was scared to admit she was in love with Neo because she had been told he was not The One. But this explanation comes from people who are not recalling the timeline properly. The reveal regarding Neo having been told by the Oracle he was not The One came much later when he and Trinity were about to re-enter the Matrix to save Morpheus (also recall that Trinity was unaware the Oracle had told Neo that either he or Morpheus was going to die. This will be important later in this discussion). Furthermore we know at this point in the film that Morpheus and Trinity recognize Neo as The One. We have Morpheus just a few minutes before the subway scene announcing ""He is The One"" (from a rooftop no less) right after Neo saves Trinity from the crash. So neither explanation fits.Now we get to the explanation people have floated that makes the most sense. Only thing is, this line of reasoning has a giant rip in it, and this is what bakes everyone's noodle. First the explanation:Trinity thought Neo was going to die! That was what she was afraid to speak of. Neo's death was one of the things the Oracle had apparently told her, and that's why Trinity was holding back. It's why she had said ""I want to tell you something, but I'm afraid of what it will mean if I do"". A reasonable fear. How would the recently awakened Neo react to such news? Trinity also has to rectify the idea of Neo dying juxtaposed to the claim that he was The One. On this last point we have Cypher's later interjection when he is awake in the Nebuchadnezzar and about to unplug Neo: ""I mean how can he be the One if he's dead?"". Trinity is in love with the man she believes to be The One, so how can it be that he is due to die? (We later learn how this could be, but Trinity does not understand at this point).So Trinity is in dilemmaville throughout the story... until near the end when she is standing over a ""dead"" Neo. It is at this moment she gets it. In an act of faith --and a nice twist on the `Princess kisses the frog' fable-- she kisses Neo and he awakens. She verbalizes her faith just before kissing him with the line: ""Neo, I'm not afraid anymore. The Oracle told me that I would fall in love with a dead man. And that man, the man that I loved would be the One. So you see, you can't be dead. You can't be, because I love you. You hear me? I love you.""So there we go. We now know what the Oracle told Trinity, and we now understand what ""everything but this"" means. We can now desist in having our noodles baked.Except for one thing. The above words are not what Trinity spoke to Neo. And herein lies our giant hole. It appears that Trinity's actual lines were: ""Neo, I'm not afraid anymore. The Oracle told me that I would fall in love with a man. And that man, the man that I loved would be the One. So you see, you can't be dead. You can't be, because I love you. You hear me? I love you.""There's nothing in that dialog about her being told she would fall for a dead man! This has been heavily debated in the online forums, with people going back to watch the movie, turning on the sub-titles, looking over published copies of the script, and even lip reading Trinity's lines! When tallied up, the consensus is that Trinity says nothing of the Oracle telling her that Neo would die.So, this explanation too is rendered invalid, yes? No. Not on your life. Neo dying is precisely what Trinity had been afraid of. OK, then why does the dialog not support this assertion? Answer, I think they made a mistake in the film. The film makers at one point have Trinity seemingly knowing from the Oracle that Neo would die (we've eliminated the other theories), yet at another point she fails to verify this notion at the crucial moment where she reveals what the Oracle said. It's basically poor exposition, and I think this assertion can be proved.Keep in mind that there are several such ""mistakes"" in the film. One example is when Morpheus's team is trying to escape from the safe house after it is compromised by agents. Cypher trips, falls, then we don't see him for a while, until suddenly he shows up in the street making a call to jack-out, a fresh accident scene in the background. WTF? How did Cypher get there? How did he break away from the team trapped in the basement of the house? How did the accident occur? What was he doing in the vehicle? I used to puzzle over that each time I viewed the film. One could certainly extrapolate that a plan was in place to safely extract Cypher from the others so that he could live on and receive his reward while everyone else died. The traffic accident could have been staged by the agents to allow Cypher to escape from police custody. But there is no exposition making this connection. I learned years later that the scene I just described as missing was in fact filmed, but had been cut from the release version. There are a number of other incongruities throughout the film (we of course forgive the brothers because The Matrix is effectively a perfect movie).Likewise we are forced to extrapolate with this Trinity thing. She must have been told Neo would die. By process of elimination it's the only explanation that fits. And it fits oh so well. Bear in mind how integral to the film Neo's death was. One of the fundamental spiritual metaphors the Wachowski Brothers employed was the resurrection of Jesus. Think about the exchange between Neo and Choi early in the film:Choi: It's Choi.Neo: Yeah. Yeah. You're two hours late.Choi: I know, it's her fault.Neo: You got the money?Choi: Two grand.Neo: Hold on.Choi: Hallelujah. You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ.Neo is the savior. He is the liberator of the lost souls of the Matrix. But to fulfill his destiny he must die. He must die in the matrix, and then transcend the matrix to be born again into a higher plane of existence. Neo's death and rebirth is the essence of the film. And the Oracle had to inform Trinity of this to prepare her for how to react when she faces a dead Neo. Don't forget that the Oracle was known for telling people what they needed to hear. Imagine Trinity's reaction after Smith shoots Neo if she had not been clued in that he would die. She may well have lost faith at that moment (just as Morpheus lost faith at the end of the second movie).So the fact that the film makers did not close the loop in Trinity's dialog is trivial. The movie is screaming what she knows. At the finale she states she is ""not afraid anymore"". She gazes upon the dead man she loves who is The One, and there is only one thing to do... she takes that leap of faith. She kisses the frog --the `dead' man who does not appear to be The One, but in fact is. Trinity knows this. She's been forewarned.And so Neo rises from the dead and the prophecy is fulfilled."	5.0	The unanswerable Matrix question	2014-06-26	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A3NJ6BKPP7IUQ9	"E. Woods ""Movie Freak"""	The Wachowski Brothers are surely brilliant. 'The Matrix' practically created the Bullet-Time genre, in which was spoofed by over 20 movies, yet this movie does it the best. The gut-pounding action is great, and the special effects are superb. The visuals are absolutely stunning. Though this is only their second directing ('Bound' being their first,) 'The Matrix' breaks so many boundaries, and is hands-down one of the greatest, no, IS the greatest Sci-Fi film of all time. I really do not see how this plot can be so 'confusing'. Begin Summary: A man, named Thomas A. Anderson leads another life as a hacker named Neo. He realizes that he has been living in an artificially created world known as 'The Matrix'. He meets the one and only Morpheus, who sends him to the real world. There, he finds out that when A.I. was invented, the machines needed solar energy to live because they were fighting with the humans, so this is how 'The Matrix' was created. Neo and other freed members must fight and destroy 'The Matrix' so the human race can be free. End Summary. Simple as that. Now if people just followed the story line and PAID ATTENTION, they would get the plot. I pretty much love this film from start to finish, and the soundtrack is great. If you're a Sci-Fi fan, make sure to pick this up on DVD with awesome features. And there's only two weeks left until 'Reloaded'...	5.0	'The Matrix'- A TRUE Classic	2003-05-01	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	AWHW07LV634F4	Eyal Teler	With hundreds and thousands of reviews here (which I haven't read), there's not much I can add. But here goes:This movie is a great action adventure, with great action sequences, and some very imaginative images  (and mediocre acting, but hey, who cares). It might not make complete sense  (wouldn't it have been less troublesome for the machines to harness nuclear  power?), but then, what other movie does? It's just very cool.The DVD  complements this beautiful movie with great production values. You get the  best scenes running at the beginning of the movie, and in the background  behind the menu. The transitions are very nice, without taking too much  time. The behind-the-scenes feature is pretty fascinating. The commentary  track is nice, and does give some more insight into the movie, but is not  that exciting. The music track is great. It's amazing to hear the music  without the actor voices or effects. It's just so cool, and I wish that  more movies would do this. There's also an exciting feature called  &quot;follow the white rabbit&quot;, where a rabbit supposedly appears on  the screen and you can then select it and see special things. I didn't see  it at work due to the software player I use (and I had a bit of trouble  with the other features, too).You also get some PC stuff, including a  storyboard and some articles. The features didn't seem to fit that well  with my screen resolution of 1280x1024, and are not terribly exciting, but  the storyboard is nice.All in all, this is a great movie and a very nice  DVD, a recommended addition to any home DVD library.	5.0	Just buy it	2000-01-28	4	4	0

Being a tech-junkie, I was enveloped by the teachings of the technical creators.The play-along commentaries by the actor who played Trinity, special effects wizard, and producer are entertaining.

0790745399	The Matrix	A204JBQ3CUB06Q	Fantastik	I'm sick and tired of people being so hung-up on firsts. Check out ANY music artist, and people will ALWAYS tell you that their first album was their best. It's the same thing with movies, and, quite frankly, with &quot;The Matrix&quot;, they're totally wrong.I loved this movie when it first came out. It was undeniably creative, had great special effects, and really revolutionized the way action films would be looked at from then on. Then, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; hit the screens. After watching all the brand new, ultra-cool stunts, taking time to think over the philosophies, and trying to take in all the aspects of its massive scale, I can safely tell you that it makes this film look rather lame.Sure, the lobby shootout and the battle in the subway station are excellent, but when compared to &quot;Reloaded&quot;'s burly brawl, freeway chase, and chateau death match, I just can't put the original on a pedestal. &quot;Revolutions&quot; with its truly epic battle for Zion (which set a benchmark in digital animation), and final showdown even further this film's mediocrity.&quot;The Matrix&quot; has never been a series people came to for its writing or acting, and this one is no exception. Keanu Reeves is dry in his delivery, but makes up for it with all the coolness of his trench coat and sunglasses. The philosophical points and views expressed in the sequels are almost totally absent in the original, with the concept of a matrix of control constantly taking center stage during the dialogue scenes. Since Neo doesn't fully become 'The One' until the last minutes of the film, you won't be seeing very much of his lightning quick Kung-Fu either, and, to me, that removes a lot of this film's excitement.It's safe to say that &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a good movie, but if you want something that will blow you away both mentally and visually, check out either of the two sequels instead.	2.0	The Sequels Put It To Shame	2004-01-21	8	2	6

0790745399	The Matrix	A3E81WX8AFEYSX	Fernando Castillo	Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the real name of Mr. Anderson. On the one hand, he is a clerk who works for an enterprise, living the life of a current man. On the other hand, he results to be a hacker called like that. He meets an odd woman (Carrie-Ann Moss) who carries him away in order to meet Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). They are a hidden group of people also called by unusual names, and Morpheus is the one who tells Neo the truth: the world where he lives isn't the real world, but one called Matrix which is made by machines for humans that don't know they are prisoners. However, they do know this, so their duty is to save human beings from there looking for someone special, chosen to be the one who will finish this war and let people be free. Morpheus believes Neo is that person, who's not sure of himself, but he must try to open his mind and see he's capable of everything now, even jumping over buildings. He will have to expose his life to danger to save Morpheus' and fight with the dreadful agents that will bring them in many problems.So brilliant. Yes, this is the best action movie I've ever seen with no doubt because a lot of things. First, it doesn't deal about gunshots and explosions most of the time, but about martial attacks, one-to-one fights, assaults in the air and people being able to do more of what a normal human would do. The special effects are excellent, and the script as well, I mean, the idea of that the world where we live is not the real world, and the conflict established between human beings and machines. Another important thing here is the look of the characters, all in black, wearing sunglasses and carrying mobile phones of the new generation. I also liked their conversations.You should watch it. There's no praise enough for this work, and I'm waiting anxiously for its sequel.	5.0	A point of reference for action movies	2002-07-30	0	0	0

I went into the theater thinking it would be a moderately entertaining way to kill a couple of hours. Man was I wrong! This movie blew me away!  Much has been said about the cult following the movie has generated and I'm  proud to be counted among them. Basically, this is  Star Wars retold for  the millenium. The symbols and the archetypes are all there. You know what?  It still works! The unexpected spin really, and I mean REALLY caught me off  guard! Once you find out what the Matrix is, and trust me you don't know  what it is unless yopu've seen it, you'll just about jump out of your seat!  In one flash, the world that you know and feel comfortable in reverses in  such a dramatic way that you will hang on every scene thereafter. Rumors  are that this is the first part of a trilogy which has already been  conceptualized and is currently in preproduction. This film ends like  &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; in that there is a lot left to go for the  story. I can't wait! Stunning visuals, great characters, awesome production  design and a script so exasperating you won't have the energy to get up  once the credits roll! This is anything but the mindless sci-fi schlock  that Hollywood churns out by the dozen. This is a truly original film,  albeit inspired by &quot;Star Wars&quot; as well as another major sci-fi  film I won't mention to save the secret.

0790745399	The Matrix	A26NLSTT75FMJM	"finulanu ""&#34;the mysterious&#34;"""	"What's this? A fast-paced, intense sci-fi action movie with a brain, amazing special effects, well-developed characters, a cool soundtrack, and so many unforgettable quotes I don't even know where to begin? Yeah, that's what you're lookin' at. Oh, and there are a lot of big explosions. Don't worry about that.I assume you've heard of this movie's special effects - the time control thing Neo (the hero) and the Agents (the villians) do is awesome. Without giving too much away, I will say that the movie's worth seeing for the subway fight between Neo and Agent Smith (or ONE of the Agent Smiths, at least) alone. Actually, the action scenes in general are worth watching the movie for alone - the airport fight, the opening scene with Trinity (a woman in a resistence force against the Matrix - I'll get to that), the rooftop fight between Neo, Trinity and the Agent Smiths (AKA the ""Dodge this"" scene), the simulated battle between Morpheus and Neo, and of course the last fight in the movie are great. Whoa...But it's not all just action: the movie presents a number of fairly deep-thinking situations(though I'll admit none of them are original): would you rather be safe or free; you are who you make yourself; the only limits are the ones you set (there is no spoon!), etc. I don't really have that many movies (music being my wife and life), but I don't think many high-speed thrillers with lots of guns and lots of karate even try to appeal to the brain. This one does.Now, a bit of background - don't worry, I won't give away the ending if you're one of the two people who hasn't seen this movie. Thomas Anderson (AKA Neo) is a hacker who thinks there's something in this life he's not picking up. What he discovers from Morpheus (who has got to be my favorite character in this movie) is that around the turn of the 21st century, machines overcame humans as a result of a war that ravaged the landscape. The humans were all put in sort of pods, I guess you'd say, sleeping, believing they were going about their daily lives as usual. But this was just a computer program, called ""The Matrix"". Morpheus leads a small band of people who have been ""awoken"" (this band includes Trinity and, eventually, Neo), and have taken it upon themselves to inform as many people as possbile about the truth behind the Matrix. Neo joins the resistance, and is trained in karate and such. Here he learns that the Matrix, like all computer programs has rules. And according to Morpheus, ""Some can be bent, some can be broken"" - this explains the movie's famous time-freeze slow-mo double flying side kick thing - after all, they are opposed by Agent Smith, a sentient program that can manifest itself as any member of the Matrix and is represented by a clean-shaven, short-haired man in a sports coat, tie and sunglasses who always wields a gun. It all goes wrong after a visit to an oracle (I won't say why they visited, because it gives too much away - but she has to be the coolest oracle of all time), and Neo and Trinity set out to set what has gone wrong right.I'm seriously having trouble seeing fault in this one - it more than justifies the two-hour plus length because the long dialouge scenes that normally bog such movies down are augmented by memorable, often dry-humored dialouge (my favorite part in that regard being the dinnertime scene aboard Morpheus' ship, the Nebuchadnezzar). And the fight scenes are awesome, too. Whoa... I think I'll take the red pill."	5.0	"""There Is No Spoon"""	2007-07-08	1	1	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A3IKBHODOTYYHM	"fra7299 ""fra7299"""	"Keanu Reeves plays Thomas Anderson the software techie by day, and Neo the computer hacker by night. In the Matrix, Neo waits for an answer of the question of existence as he stares at his computer screen. The answer comes in the form of a message on his screen, and this leads to his meeting a mysterious woman, Trinity, who introduces him to a dimension where reality and illusion are fused. Morpheus is the leader of this group of futuristic warriors, and tries to explain the existence of the matrix,  a type of artificial intelligence system. Morpheus opens Neo's mind to some startling news: that people are being imprisoned in a form of reality, and that Neo is ""the one"" who will break this code and free, both physically and spiritually, those who are trapped. Neo certainly has his doubts, but as he examines the world around him, he realizes that this is the chance he's been waiting for, and it seems that destiny has called.One of the refreshing aspects about the Matrix is there is some ""meat"" to a special effects genre that by now has become mostly visual eye candy for the masses, as special effects extravaganzas in the past decade that overdose on CGI could take a lesson from this film. After all, The Matrix is not ALL about special effects, and incorporates a well-crafted conflict within the film's first twenty minutes. There is a certain amount of good versus evil within the film, and nothing is as cut and dry as it appears. Neo's existence is pivotal to the world that Morpheus introduces him to, and there is a certain amount of build up between not only what Neo believes is real and what is illusion, but also what his ultimate fate will be. Neo's uncertainty about the world is the centerpiece for his choice to join Morpheus, and, he has a slight reluctance because he knows once he's in, there's no turning back.The aggravation with a film like this is the poetic license, the proverbial ""easy"" button given once the theme of appearance vs. reality is introduced. After all, many inconsistencies can be explained away by the use of the ""oh, but it was just part of a dream"" or ""it was only in his mind."" Because of this, you have to have some ""logic blinders"" at certain points, but I guess that is to be expected.I thought the first two-thirds of the film were the strongest in script, tension, and visual display, but that the last thirty minutes seemed to ""cave in"" to the sol-mo ""shoot `em up"" style typical of action films. This conclusion is victimized by seemingly never-ending shooting sequences and kung-fu martial arts with blaring techno music in the background. It becomes a bit too repetitive and drawn out.  Still, with its flaws, The Matrix has an adequate mix of edge, fantasy, innovation and philosophy without crossing the bounds of outright insanity, and is vastly superior to the spawn of effects clones spewed out in the past decade."	4.0	Visually impressive...and it has a plot too.	2009-07-24	0	0	0

I can't find anything not to like and even watching this again 10 years after its release it is still an excellent film.  The whole storyline and premise is so intriquing, acting so good and overall cinematography so excellent that this would be a hit even if it was released today.  This dvd is also very good as far as standard formats go with an excellent sound quality coming in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and the picture quality is very good indeed.  The special features has a very good making of documentary and I appreciated the whole white rabbit feature as well.  I am at a loss to think of anything bad to say about this standard dvd format version of this great film.  It'll be interesting to see just how much better the Blu-ray version is as this standard version is already so good.Very highly recommended!Updated 16 Sep 2011:Amazon won't let me do this separately so I'll have to append this here.  The Digibook Blu-ray release of this great film is real treat for fans.  This picture quality is excellent in 1080p and the sound quality is also very good although I personally would have preferred DTS HD MA but this Dolby TrueHD is still pretty good.  I've always had a soft spot for digibooks and so this already makes for me a worthy double-dip and upgrade from the standard dvd I reviewed above.  The special feature making-of documentaries are extensive and the very long audio soundtrack of a selection of tunes from the movie is also a nice treat.  The Prodigy and Rage Against The Machine tracks are not here but we do get a video of Marilyn Manson's ""Rock Is Dead"".Very, very highly recommended!"	5.0	Ten Years After and Still A Great Movie!

0790745399	The Matrix	A3JDO81XMBVIIZ	Fred Klein	Sometimes you just don't know what words to use when you're writing something.  Sometimes you trip over your tongue (or fingers) and just lock up.  I'm not really sure how to begin this review; all that I can say right now is that everybody I know agrees that THE MATRIX is one of the best movies on the planet.At first look, the plot is familiar enough; petty thief turned superhero, has to save the world while fighting giant robots and hacking into computer programs blah blah blah blah blah.  So, if that's the case, why isn't THE MATRIX sitting on the shelves with a ninety percent price reduction like so many other movies?A few words can answer that question.  First, there's uniqueness.  If anybody here can show me one movie like this one, I'll give 'em fifty bucks.  (If they're lucky.)  Don't even think about saying TERMINATOR.  Yes, although both movies feature the same setup, they are NOT at all alike.The second word that comes to mind is action.  With most movies of this genre, yeah, you can probably expect three or maybe even four guys hunkering down with their peashooters and their water pistols and leaning around the corner of that bale of hay which provides them protection from even 12-gages to squeeze off twenty shots at a time without hitting anything.  Not so here, my friends.  In THE MATRIX, yeah, you get plenty of shots of heros and heroines packing a big wallop with twin Uzis.  But you also get shoot-outs with men dodging bullets (for any gamers reading this, think MAX PAYNE), people jumping a hundred yards from on rooftop to another, and hand-to-hand combat like you've never seen before (John Woo did an incredible job).  There's a reason that this movie won awards for the best fight scene of the year.This superb display of action in other movies might leave little other room for the third and final word which sets THE MATRIX apart: plot.  Yes, it's there all right.Okay, so maybe you've heard this sort of thing before; guy meets old wise guy, old wise guy trains guy to blow the crap out of things with style, young guy with hair problems betrays them, etc.  However, it's the style of writing that sets THE MATRIX apart most of all.  Every character has a personality from Neo, the absolutely amazing hero, Trinity, the big-breasted, Uzi packing heroine, Morpheus (the aforementioned &quot;old wise guy who trains guy to blow the crap out of things&quot;), and Cypher (shudder....).So.  Does THE MATRIX live up to its praise?  Yes.  Does it break new ground in its genre?  Oh yes.  Should you buy it?  Hmmm, let's think about this for a moment.Heck yes.	5.0	One of the Best Movies in the Real World	2001-08-13	3	1	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A9K6X9ZG5C8WR	Fredrik Lindgren	I'll give this movie an extra star for its elegant effects, the rest is overrated. The endless semi intellectual dialogs throughout the movie is trying hard to be wise, but ending up just being overexplicit and dull.  Although inspiration is a serious source of motivation, Matrix is stealing  in a very unpleasant and obvious way from Total Recall (the reality pills  and the different planes of consiousness), Bladerunner (darkness, search  for inner truth) and other futuristic filmpieces. Matrix could have been  given a decent script without the patronizing and silly texts, better lead  character (Keanu Reeves is really no good)and less reliance on the stylish  and flashy (but empty) effects. Maybe then it would deserve the hype it now  still recieves, I guess only because of the lack of good Hollywood cinema,  where audience is fooled to believe that once a movie rises out of the rest  of the crap, it immediatly becomes a masterpiece./Fredrik Lindgren  University of Film and ArtSkovde, Sweden	2.0	Where's the script and what's all the fuss about?	1999-08-27	2	1	1

"I am sticking my neck out here by going against the grain and giving this movie a bad review, but some things need to be said.The first is that anyone who thinks this concept was original hasn't been around very long.  The Star Trek episode ""Specter of the Gun"" found Kirk, Checkov, Spock and McCoy in a matrix-type world, with the same solution - realizing that the bullets weren't real. Star Trek TNG beat the same concept nearly to death with its multiple ""holodeck goes crazy"" episodes.To find the real source of this idea all one has to do is read a little ancient Greek philosophy, where the question ""can you trust your senses?"" pops up time and again, just as it does in the writings of Hume, Kant, etc., etc.And you call that acting?  Keanu Reeves is wooden and flat.  Fishburne is over the top, and the Oracle is just annoying.Plus the underlying premise - aliens keep people in virtual reality chambers their entire lives so they can suck out their body energy.  Come on guys - ever hear of nuclear power?  A lot cheaper and much less maintenance.The whole film looked like a video game, which is probably why it has proven popular with certain types of people.  You know who you are.  As for me, rehashed themes, bad acting and special effects don't make a good movie."	2.0	"I'm ready for the ""no"" votes"	2005-07-05	24	11	13
0790745399	The Matrix	A2HM2E8CHPYFQ8	Fritz Wilhelm	Matrix asks the important question &quot;What is reality&quot;. &quot;What if we are actually asleep and dreaming our reality?&quot; Buddha, Heraclitus, Socrates, and Gurdjeff all knew that most people are asleep, and that the true problem for mankind and womankind is how to wake up.Also, in excellent mystic or Zen fashion, the oracle, an unassuming black housewife, tells our hero, what he needs to know, not what he wants to know, or doesn't want to know. By not taken either of two alternatives, Neo transcends the artificially created reality of computer &quot;intelligence&quot;.

0790745399	The Matrix	AIIL64Q6KIVBV	Gary Ragaglia	My low expectations for this film were not disappointed. It takes what could have been a truly compelling idea and predictably suffocates it in mediocre acting, ludicrous shootouts, and special effects overkill. As in  so many other movies of its kind, thoughtful intelligence takes a back seat  to theatrics and mass audience mentality-this is just so many empty visual  calories. &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, after all these years, still rules.	1.0	This is a glorified video game.	1999-12-03	150	22	128
0790745399	The Matrix	A212UN6M93BLRZ	Gary R. Bradski	Well worth a watch...but one peeve: I'll be obscure so as not to give it away for newbies...but, if machines needed batteries, why not use pigs?...much safer.  Instead, I'd update the plot in Matrix 2 so that the machines really also need some computational resource (intuition? spirituality? whatever) from human brains...(wish list) then the humans battle back to somewhat of the upper hand by end of Matrix 2 but due to long dependence or degraded Earth, end up also needing the machines and so can't destroy them.  Matrix 3 would be the mutual battle to dominate the other without entirelly killing off the other and ending up in some sort of mutual symbiosis. End of story.  Well, that's how it would go if I were script writer.	5.0	Could use one tweek to the plot...	2000-12-26	4	0	4
0790745399	The Matrix	A392YS0W837HFU	Gary Robin	&quot;The Matrix&quot; has to be rated with &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; as one of the best Sci Fi movies of all time! This movie has it all: a wonderful storyline, excellent acting, the best special effects of all time, nonstop action, romance, wonderful fight sequences and best of all two sequels to follow! This is one of the few perfect movies I have seen.  This movie must be viewed on a large screen, letterboxed edition and with surround sound. It must be seen several times to fully appreciate all of the subtleties of the story line.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; must be viewed in the DVD letterbox edition as VHS does not do it justice.

0790745399	The Matrix	A11RDBEEXNUXFQ	Gaylin Walli	With thousands of reviews written on THE MATRIX, it seems rather silly to regurgitate what others have already written. Still, I'm compelled to comment on a movie that is slightly left of center. People will claim that this is a good special effects movie, a good action movie, and an excellent commentary on the nature of reality itself. Indeed, Lawrence Fishburne's character Morpheus asks us, &quot;What is real? How do you define real?&quot; And this question is the one that pervades the movie in every sense, starting from a very coherent whole and spinning deeper and deeper until it emerges into a very fresh approach to the &quot;apocalypse&quot; movie theme that was previously dominated by the Terminator movies.I am not personally fond of Keanu Reeves's acting in this movie. He seems detached and emotionless in comparison to his efforts in movies like Point Break and, I'm amazed to say, Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure. Carrie Ann Moss seems slightly better in her role as the painfully slim but otherwise fashionably attired Trinity. Her performance at least had more depth than that of Reeves. I personally think that Laurence Fishburne was the best of all the leads, taking his character Morpheus to places emotionally that Reeves hardly touches and Moss approaches, but teeters on the edge of.The movie as a whole intrigued me, then proceeded to fascinate me. The concept, a post-apocalyptic twist with vague associations to the machine wars of &quot;Terminator&quot; and &quot;Terminator II&quot;, was intriguing enough to me that I seriously considered the &quot;what if&quot; idea of a pseudo-reality imposed by computers. It's enough to make your mind boggle if you take it *too* seriously, but I think those are the most enjoyable movies. Just close enough to reality to make you really wonder, and just far enough out of touch with reality to make the movie enjoyable, fresh, and watchable again and again.Now about the action...the fight scenes are great. Watching the &quot;Follow the White Rabbit&quot; cuts interspersed on the DVD and watching the &quot;making of&quot; information available really rounds out the value of this movie purchase for me. It's  stunning to watch the training and the technology of movie making meld together to make a final scene that pushes the bounds of physical reality just enought that you think &quot;Damn! I wish I could do that myself!&quot; In my house, when a group of friends come over and discuss martial arts, THE MATRIX inevitably ends up in the DVD player as a visual aid to the discussion.Would I rescue the DVD from a fire? Probably so. Would I buy a copy for a friend who didn't have one? Absolutely. Would I see it again if they re-released it in the theatres? Without a doubt.	5.0	an enjoyable punch just left of center	2000-09-21	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A31O7B59DW7OHR	Gene Bromberg	I watched &quot;The Matrix&quot; and afterwards I said to myself, &quot;Now, that was really cool&quot;. It's not a movie to change your life or teach you some great lesson. It's a movie you watch and then you sit  back with a big grin on your face and you say, &quot;Yeah, that was really,  really cool&quot;.The movie has it all-- or, if it doesn't have it all,  it has enough of what it takes to qualify as a total blast of a movie. It's  one of the most visually striking movies I've seen in a long time, the  helicopter scene, the jump scene, all those washed out olives and browns  when they are trapped in the building. And then you have the great special  effects, the lunatic gunplay, the insane kung fu, and a frightening  futuristic plot all come together to produce a flick that is flat-out fun.It also has Laurence Fishburne, here strengthening his case as the  Coolest Man On The Planet. It also has Keanu Reeves, and while Reeves  hasn't displayed much evidence in the past that he can actually ACT, here  he is perfectly case as an insomniac-criminal-hacker slash  messianic-chopsocky-superhero.Filming for the Matrix 2 AND 3 is about to  start, so worry ye not about the wide-open ending. It's nice to watch a  movie that is obviously set up for a sequal and find that you actually WANT  to see the sequal when it appears.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1FS9R0JXHLHEG	George Annessa	With groundbreaking special effects technology, a philisophical / scientific story and easily watchable - The Matrix has it all. Keanu Reeves is Neo, the hacker believed by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to be the ass kicking Christ-like figure who must save the enslaved world from the Matrix. To do so, he must battle the agents, dodge bullets, have beautifully chereographed fight scenes and one hell of a shootout. Carrie-Anne Moss is the woman Neo loves and is loved by, Trinity.A mesmerizing, eye popping visual extravaganza that redefined science fiction and revitalized interest in the theme of man VS machine - mixed in with religion, philosophy and some great lines from Laurence Fishburne, you have a cyberpunk classic which can be seen again and again - a phenomenon.	5.0	A Phenomenon - You Have To See It For Yourself...	2004-05-03	7	6	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A1X47U1QYK50OE	George Mallone	"Discussions of The Matrix manage to send sparks flying whenever a fan and a hater should happen to bring up the topic. So (assuming you've been living under a rock since '98) what exactly is this film that managed to spawn a devoted following and equally devoted detractors? (A phenomenon you can witness simply by viewing other customer's reviewes.)It's the tale of Neo (Keanu Reeves), a young man leading, as the nefarious Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) says, ""two lives."" By day he works for a respectable software company, by night he's a hacker, searching at his computer screen for answers to his question, and for the man he thinks can answer them. The man he seeks is Morpheus, a ""terrorist"" sometimes called the Most Dangerous Man Alive, and the question, the question that acts like a splinter in his mind, driving him mad, is: ""What is the Matrix?""He's soon contacted by a member of outlaw Morpheus's group of merry men, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who leads Neo to Morpheus, and thus to Neo's encounter with the truth about reality (undoubtedly one of the finest ... moments in Cinema). And so begins our entry into the wild, graphically intense, kung-fu filled alterverse envisioned by the Wachowski brothers.The Matrix has ""cool!"" factor to spare. So many things, such as the learning of entire martial arts disciplines in seconds, the dodging of bullets, intense slow-mo battle scenes, flying across rooftops, and Federal Agents from Hell (led by the aforementioned Hugo Weaving, who proves to be the most indestructible sci-fi menace since Terminator 2's T1000) leave you on the edge of your seat, waiting for and wondering what the NEXT thing they'll throw at you will be.The most interesting thing about the Matrix though, is the vast variation in people's interpretations of its meaning. I've heard The Matrix described as everything from a metaphor about the Welfare State to a rebellious rejection of social conformity, and beyond; references to everything from Greek Mythology to the Bible abound (Trinity, anyone?), and at its core the story is a rather obvious live-action anime-style retelling of the story of Christ. Don't let that turn you off though; even as an avowed atheist I greatly enjoyed it :)Now to the weaknesses. The characters are rather underdeveloped, the acting not so spectacular, though Carrie-Anne Moss turns in an underrated performance as the strong-yet-vulnerable love interest. And Weaving is delightful as Agent Smith (can't mention him enough!)There were some rather edit-room floor worthy sequences (personally I found the Oracle bit a little silly), and the whole bit towards the end regarding our hero's ""Second Coming"", was, well, contrived indeed. Luke Skywalker probably couldn't do that, and he had the Force with him! Also, after the first few viewings...well, this is more the type of movie you watch *scenes* of then actually watching the whole movie. Which belies its fundamental weakness; it DOES put style-before-substance, but with style to spare, and just enough substance, The Matrix manages to carve out a niche in the Pantheon of Good Sci-Fi, despite its weaknesses.So, are the fans right about it being ""THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER!""? No. Are the critics right about it being an ""Stylized MTV-generation piece of tripe""? No again. I could say that its a good, solid Sci-Fi/action flick, but that wouldn't do you any good. For as the Great Morpheus himself says: ""You cannot be told what The Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."""	4.0	Visually stunning, overrated by fans, underrated by critics.	2001-07-03	3	0	3

0790745399	The Matrix	AV7ATN4TN8AQT	"GeoX ""GeoX"""	Okay, this film's kinda fun if you don't think about it too hard, but when people characterize it as &quot;thought-provoking&quot; or similar, I have to assume that they, ahem, don't read much.  I mean, really: The Matrix  doesn't have an original thought in its head.  The &quot;robots controlling  humans&quot; business plays *exactly* like something from an old issue of  Heavy Metal (now THERE'S a shining bastion of literary quality), and the  &quot;what is reality?&quot; affair has been done with *much* more aplomb  by such authors as Philip K. Dick, Samuel Delany, and Robert Anton Wilson.  And as for the characters...crikey.  What can you say?  Here's a fun game:  read Neuromancer, then watch The Matrix and shout out each character's name  as he/she appears.  You shouldn't have much trouble.All in all, a truly  preposterous film, yet strangely enjoyable.  Just phase out the bits where  it tries and fails to be profound, enjoy the goofily mindless action  sequences, and laugh at the numerous unintentionally funny segments, and  you should spend an enjoyable couple hours.	3.0	Ooh!

0790745399	The Matrix	A2TUONQ9UPTJCP	geraint thatcher	The reviwe that say's this film is for Nerds got it dead on. When I finished watching it I was left with the impression that I got. The film has some major problems as well. 1)The plot is unoriginal with some major  holes  E.G Why did not the agents takeover the gaurds in the Lobby scene  and in the beginging scene or simply take over Keanu while he was in the  matrix.2)The acting except for Fishburnes performance and Agent Smith's  is completely wooden. I expexct no less from Keanu Reeves but not the  other's.3)Keanu Reeves the guy cannot act (in anything)and I am still  wondering why he was chosen for the film and why he won an acting award?  They should have had somone else.4)The fact that the so called hero's  spend more time gunning down the people they are supposed to save does not  give me the slightst sympathy for them. In fact they are more like  terroists than freedom fighter's.5)The fight scenes are good then you  see a Jet Li movie and you see real figh scenes. I am glad he is in the  Sequel. Only thing about that is that watching him get beaten up by Keanu  REEVES WILL BE HARD TO SWALLOW.The film is severly overrated and I hope  the sequel is better.	2.0	An overrated film with serious flaws	2000-06-08	18	6	12
0790745399	The Matrix	A1WOFFWF8UYPJ2	Gerald Booth	I had a chance to see Andy and Larry Wachowski's ground breaking thrill ride a minute movie, The Matrix, last night. I have to say that as writers the two brothers are very good Directors.&gt; The story is fairly straightforward. It seems that our reality is not really our reality but a computer generated one and the year is somewhere close to 2200. The computers harvest babies and use them as giant batteries to keep the computer generated world running as they see fit. Afew special people are able to break out of this dream life and begin their battle against the computers. One group, led by Morpheus, is searching for the mythical &quot;One&quot;. A man who will be able to fight the computers with their own strengths and lead humanity back to the pinnacle of life where we once existed. Morpheus believes he has found this person when he finds Neo. The rest of the story details the training of Neo, the discovery of a traitor in their ranks, and the eventual battle between Neo and the Agents of the computer.&gt; The special effects and the action sequences keep this movie going. Unfortunately nothing truly spectacular occurs in any of these sequences. I am not saying they were bad there have just been better sequences in many other movies.For the most part the actors do their best with the roles they have been  given. Laurence Fishburn tackles the role of Morpheus and gives the performance we have come to expect from him. He is able to draw attention to himself at any time without saying a word and when he speaks his voice wraps itself around you and transports you away with its power. Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity. She is, in a word, BAD...and that's good. It has been a  long time since we have seen quite as tough a woman in film. Ripley would be proud of her.&gt; Now we come to Neo. Keanu Reeves has done a good job as an action hero before. This time he is passable but that is all. Some scenes, like when he walks through the metal detector and unleashes an arsenal are great. Other scenes don't work as well. His acting ability has frequently been in question and this is one of those times. The first half of the movie his dazed expression is completely befitting of a character who is bombarded with the information he is receiving. Unfortunately that expression stays on him the rest of the movie. Remember my comments concerning the power of Fishburn's voice? Keanu is not blessed with the same gift. In fact at all times he sounds as if he is stoned beyond belief.Though the story is silly and meanders off on different tangents I am not saying I disliked this movie. I will say that it wasn't the be all and end all of Sci-Fi/Action movies. However it was relatively entertaining and I am not sorry I went.	3.0	good but not great	2002-03-28	3	1	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A1T2E1SY35D6ML	Gerard T. McGuire	This movie was created for a DVD player. The story..... Keanu Reeves is  NEO, a premier computer hacker looking for the ultimate hacker, Morpheus.  He knows that Morpheus holds the key to the computer myth of the Matrix.  Little does he know that realizing just what the Matrix is will destroy his  perception of reality as he knows it.The movie....outstanding. Killer  special effects with a clarity that jump off of your T.V..  Sound that  jumps from your surround speakers. A high tempo soundtrack that gets your  pulse kicked into overdrive.  The fight scenes are surreal. The computer  effects are so fluid, you catch yourself gasping at how real it all  seems.The cast is put together nicely.  Keanu doesnt exactly flex his  acting muscles and Lawrence Fishburn is a little too serious,(He at times  seems like he is narrating a documentary). But this isnt Shakespeare so  their performances do not detract from the overall  enjoyablility of the  movie.The DVD comes with the extras that make it worth a couple of extra  bucks....but they kept the price low anyway!!!.

0790745399	The Matrix	A26PRXU85FLDTB	Giovanni Salamon	This movie has similarities to Terminator, and Terminator 2, where in the future machines have become self-sufficient, and then when their creaters try to pull the plug, the machines stay alive and enslave the human race.  The Terminator differs in that the machine (Sky-net), created a nuclear  was between Russia and America when their creators tried to pull the plug.  This war killed off humans, allowing the machines to stay on, and using  surviving humans in the nuclear winter as slaves.  A resistance was in  effect to free the human slaves from the machine, where the leader, this  time, was in the past. The Matrix, on the other hand, having a similar  theme to this movie, the humans, I would assume, create a nuclear explosion  to create a nuclear winter to block out the sunlight of the machines, as  they adapted to solar power.  In this respect, Matrix and Terminator are  similar, except in Matrix, the human inventors create an explosion to block  sun-light, the energy source of the machines, while in Terminator, the  machine creates an explosion.I think Lawrence Fishborne's acting was  cool, as in the Event Horizon.  The character-plot was cool.There is  another movie similar to this that was made a decade ago, that involved  people's minds being placed into a machine for different realities, this  time in the context of a psychristic hospital for treatment, I forgot the  name of that movie.I do not like the Eastern Religious content in the  movie, the scene from the Oracle, I thought was too indoctrinating and  should of been shorter, too much time in the movie was on that.  Secondly,  I do not like the use of God's name in the movie.  Two stars deducted on  that.Three stars, for originality, action, acting, and I had a really  great time watching the movie and felt refreshed afterwards, like I  travelled somewhere.  No movie I watched gave such an effect, except for  mabye Star Wars, to that extent.  A reality vacation.	3.0	Nice movie.  - A short reality excursion -	2000-01-19	12	3	9

This visually stunning film introduces us to the  world of the future where machines rule, and most of humankind has been reduced to a power source.But there are rebels.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3IXOTBQ767WJ7	Glen Eric Reed	Say what you will about Keanu Reeves, but he's certainly getting better at picking vehicles for his &quot;acting&quot; talents. Also to his credit is the fact that only once was I reminded of his character from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Trust me, that's an improvement. This is Reeves at his best - standing there and looking pretty while the action happens around him.There are a few themes that films can use that (in my mind, at least) almost always work well. The Matrix manages to touch on two of them: the fight for freedom and overcoming fear. Wrap that around a slick sci-fi core with some eye-popping effects and you've got something that can keep me in my seat and smiling for a couple of hours. Simply put, the movie just oozes cool. And that's a good thing. Hey, it worked great for The Fifth Element.Overall, The Matrix is at its best delivering the stereotyped Hong Kong style action, but its the surrounding script and Reeves's supporting cast that make this a memorable flick. Laurence Fishburne gives a great, no-nonsense performance as Morpheus, the leader/father of a group of futuristic freedom fighters. My vote for the best performance in this one, though,  has to go to the small role of the Oracle, brought to life by Gloria Foster. It's a small but pivotal role that could have easily turned into the loose thread that pulled this movie apart. Foster's performance makes sure this one stays tied together. Hers is the hingepin scene in this  movie, and the writing held everything together (remember, &quot;there is no spoon&quot;).	4.0	Like this needs another review...	2000-10-24	5	4	1

0790745399	The Matrix	AMFGLBG3YUR7H	G. Monstre	Enter the Matrix where the real is unreal. This film tries to provide an explanation to those who feel the observable day to day does quiet seem real. This film almost feels like a movie about how it feels like one is watching a movie every moment of their lives. There are a few who know the truth and want to help wake up those who don't realize it. Hence, the ultimate wake up call comes in the form of Neo, a disenchanted computer hacker who seeks to find out what is reality and how to enter it. The tension of the film comes when one of the inner circle decides to betray the others. Turns out reality isn't as beautiful or delicious as the matrix. The villain wants back into the system. Call it bureaucracy is better than starving. Keep in mind these guys are eating gruel, wearing what looks like prison garb and constantly on the run when they are finally awaken. It might get to some people. The Matrix is the search for the Messiah of the times. The times simply happens to be in a the future where robots harvest humans for energy.	4.0	A Phony Is a Simulation of Self	2013-01-04	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A1CIW2OEVAJRM2	Godly Gadfly	"Few films have intrigued me as much as The Matrix, especially on intellectual, philosophical and religious levels.  The setting is a futuristic world, although viewers are not privy to this fact at the onset.  Only later does it become evident that what we have first thought was reality, is in fact purely a collective consciousness and an artificial world perceived only in the mind, and the product of a central computer system called the Matrix into which everyone is plugged in.  Like the characters themselves, there is a critical turning point where we are startled to discover that the world we thought was real is only an illusion (a similar plot device was used to great effect in 2001's A Beautiful Mind).An instant hit when it was first released in 1999, it has to be admitted that the film works on the level of story alone. The main character is Thomas Anderson, a computer hacker with the handle Neo.  Under the guidance of the mysterious Morpheus, Neo comes to discover what the Matrix is, and escapes its grip by swallowing a red pill, which enables him to reject the false reality of the Matrix in exchange for the real world. Neo becomes ""the One"", but with the help of Trinity and Morpheus, can he liberate humanity from the power of the machines, the Matrix, and the multiple incarnations of Agent Smith?  Computer animation and a multitude of special effects open the way for stunning action sequences (justifying the R rating) and a fast-paced plot that few could forget.But it is the concept of an artificial world in the mind created by the Matrix that occupies the most interest for me.  It immediately raises a host of philosophical questions about what constitutes reality and what is true knowledge.  This is evident from the dialogue itself, when Morpheus asks: ""Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?""  Questions like these are precisely the ones that are at the heart of the philosophical discipline of epistemology.  In the words of Morpheus:  ""What is ""real""? How do you define ""real""?  If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply, electrical signals interpreted by your brain.""  Neo himself reflects: ""You ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?"" At times, these philosophical questions become the subject of amusement and humor, such as when Cypher chooses the pleasures of the artificial world rather than the real one, simply because of the material pleasures of a good meal it offers: ""You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss.""To a Christian, such epistemological questions have an important contemporary application, in view of Bible passages such as 2 Corinthians 5:7 ""We walk by faith, not by sight"", Hebrews 11:1 ""Faith is the substance of things hope for, the evidence of things not seen"" and John 8:32 ""And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.""  The fact is that reality isn't just the world we see, and through faith we know that there is more to life than appearances.  It takes faith to perceive the true reality of an ongoing spiritual warfare that involves angels and demons, and the rule of Jesus Christ.  In that sense the story of the Matrix can be used as a parable of coming to faith, and how through the Word our eyes are opened and we learn to ""see"" the ""real"" world for the first time.  The imagery of being plugged into the false world of the Matrix also bears rich parallels with the appeal of slavery to sin, as Morpheus notes: ""That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.""  Elsewhere he states that ""these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it."" Little wonder that Cypher makes his choice to remain a slave to the Matrix: ""All I do is what he tells me to do. If I had to choose between that and the Matrix, I'd choose the Matrix.""  How true this is of bondage to sin for all of us!But although these might serve as useful spiritual illustrations, it is doubtful that this is the point of the movie, even despite the fact that Neo is clearly portrayed as a Messianic Christ-like figure who redeems mankind from slavery.  Neo even dies and is raised again, bringing about the victory of ""Zion"".  Another instance of this Messianic imagery is when Choi says to him: ""Hallelujah. You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ.""  But that doesn't make the Matrix a Christian allegory.  I agree with those who insist that it does not succeed as such.  In general, any tale that tries to retell the gospel in a different form is going to fail miserably (e.g. the sense of growing Messianic consciousness has no Biblical justification), and the Matrix is no exception.  But I'm not convinced that a spiritual allegory is what The Matrix is undertaking to be in the first place.Despite appearances, the abundance of Biblical symbolism throughout the film doesn't mean that The Matrix is offering a Christian message, because in actual fact it draws not just on Christianity, but a multitude of other themes.  It is widely agreed that there are allusions not just to Christianity, but also Eastern mysticism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Gnosticism, Socratic, Cartesian and Platonic idealism, modern culture, and even light hearted references to the absurdity of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"", eg ""Follow the white rabbit ... You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.""  Despite the copious amounts of religious symbolism, it is entirely doubtful that The Matrix is intended to be an allegory of the gospel, since it merely draws on Christian imagery and symbolism in the same way as it draws on philosophy and a plethora of thinking from other religions as well.  Both those who want to criticize The Matrix as blasphemy and those who want to applaud it as a new gospel are mistaken, because both interpretations seem incorrect.But if The Matrix is not trying to be an allegory, does that mean that the Christian symbolism is legitimate or is it blasphemous?  Great literature throughout the ages has drawn on Christian symbolism to make stories more powerful, and that seems to be what is also happening in this movie.  Granted, it's doubtful that the author of the script intend to glorify God in borrowing Christian symbolism - does this make it blasphemous?  I'm not sure.  Those symbols have power in themselves, because they are true, and as a Christian watching the movie I am affirmed in my own belief system and can find it powerful that way.  Could it perhaps be argued that the movie is in itself not inherently blasphemous in that respect, but it depends on the intention of the author of the script, and the intention of the viewer?  In that respect it could be blasphemous for those who reject the underlying truths behind this imagery, because if script-writers who employ these powerful Christian images deny their truth, they do so to their own peril for these images themselves are inherently true.  It is dangerous to play with serious and powerful truths, not realizing just how serious and how powerful they really are.  Much more can be said on this issue, and these are just tentative reflections.Complete books have been written about the theological and philosophical questions raised by The Matrix.  It's questions like these, along with the special effects and fast-paced action, that have combined to make the Matrix the wild success it was.  In the end, I'm of the conviction that this film comes across being more serious than what it really is.  The spiritual depth is in fact somewhat of an illusion - The Matrix primarily aims to tell a good story, but just throws on a philosophical and theological coat to make the story more impressive.  As others before me have contended: it's pseudo-intellectual.  This isn't a criticism of the film, but a criticism of a wrong understanding of the film.  To me, the philosophical window-dressing remains one of the film's attractions, and makes The Matrix much more interesting than the average cinema experience.  But I don't think it is primarily intended as a philosophical work, but as entertainment, and needs to be analyzed in that light.  As such it succeeds.  It might not answer all the deep philosophical and theological questions it raises, but it has value in raising them, and gives us a good story besides. - GODLY GADFLY"	4.0	Spiritually and philosophically intriguing!	2007-02-15	6	4	2

Laurence Fish &quot;Morpheus&quot;,acting is out of this &quot;fake  world&quot;, well you know what I mean, we live in a &quot;dream  world&quot;(To bad my creditors dont see it that way.)

Since were living in a  &quot;false or dream world&quot;,I wonder do prisoners who have 25 to life  behind bars also believe their prison term is a dream?  People who have  watch and loved Kung fu movies (5 Deadly Venoms and other SHAW Bros. films)  will not be surprise at the fight seens in this movie. For those of you who  can't get enough of the fight seens in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, buy  &quot;Iron Monkey&quot; (1993 version).  I do think that for the sequel,  William Shatner should play &quot;Morpheus&quot; and Keanu Reeves  &quot;Neo&quot; should be played by an Actor.

Nothing in this strange, superficial world is what it seems- especially  when it come to keeping the peace. You have two choices: either learn to  use the Matrix for your own side- or die.Everything about the movie was  fairly good, though the real treat is the visual effects, as you've  probably heard by now. The computer graphics are seamless and perfect- they  really add flavor to the movie. Then you can get into the plot itself- a  refreshing look into the paranoid. It's one of those things that really  makes you look at life, even though it's probably in a weirded out,  paranoid way. The acting is good, too, and Keanu Reeves does a great job  with his role. The features included with the DVD are great, too, and I  could just sit, watching the opening screen for a half an hour, at least.  (It's really cool!)This movie is philosophical and deep at times, and  then a few moments later it's full of good guys duking it out with creepy  agent guys.

Because the matrix is No.1!When it comes down or what should I say UP to the acting performance's keanu reeves and the rest of the cast perform wonderfully and I MUST pull over to mention that &quot;Hugo Weaving&quot; who plays the top agent (Agent Smith) controlling the matrix which is everything, gives a wonderful villian acting performance that I love, No doubt my favourite character is Agent Smith. You cant go through the movie without thinking &quot;How cool are the agents&quot;! Later in the movie keanu reeves's character get some more character and shows us that wonderful black outfit!Best movie fight ever is to be expected between Agent Smith and Neo.I love the way Agent Smith calls Neo &quot;Mr. Anderson&quot; it sounds so cool coming from him and it pisses off Neo!Oh well yep,THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!	5.0	The Matrix	2003-09-18	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A91LOU9XGER2N	Harold Corbin	I'm a fan of all types of movies, and coming up with a top 10 list is a challenge for anyone... but #1 is a no-brainer: The Matrix. This movie is full of eye candy, drama, action, great acting, comedy, and thrills. It's a non-stop rollercoaster that you'll want to watch over and over. The DVD has some great features that you can watch directly from the special features menu, or indivudually as they appear during the movie. The featurette on how they filmed the sweeping 360 degree slow motion scenes is fascinating.I don't buy many movies, as I don't typically like to watch the same film more than once or twice. This film in a rare exception, and it is the type of movie that you can pop in the DVD player and lose yourself in the story while running for 30 minutes on the treadmill. The only problem is pulling yourself away from the action to get back to your normal life.If you are a fan of Star Wars, Stargate, Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, or any modern sci fi action movie, you need to add The Matrix to your permanent collection. You'll love it.	5.0	A Sci-Fi Thriller of the highest caliber	2003-03-04	4	2	2
0790745399	The Matrix	AZ8H7JCN1ZHZA	Harpingonforever	I just saw this last week. I have to say, it was very good. The whole slow-motion thing got annoying after a while, and I expected the characters to be a little more fleshed out. But overall, I really kinda loved it. The costumes were so cool--black leather isn't that interesting, but they pulled it off. The Lobby scene has to be my favorite scene, not because I'm a lover of violence (I'm not), but because it must've been so fun to film, and how the guard reacts when Neo goes through the scanner. The script could've been better, and the Agents were a little boring, but it was visually entertaining, and there was something about it that I really felt drawn to.Now, humans probably wouldn't be stupid enough to put out the sun(that's really STUPID!!), and in the sequels, I feel like things are too easy for him because he manipulates the Matrix too easily. But the first movie was really good, and the costumes are cool, and it's just a great movie. I can see Hollywood trying to pull this off again, and in no way does it ever work because this was pretty original, and original stuff can't be copied.So.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3UV9R7OG21BO1	Hector Juan Colon	The Reality Is All Virtual, And Densely Complicated.Action heroes speak volumes about the couch-potato audiences that they thrill. So it's understandable that ''The Matrix,'' a furious special-effects tornado directed by the imaginative brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski (''Bound''), couldn't care less about the spies, cowboys and Rambos of times gone by. Aiming their film squarely at a generation bred on comics and computers, the Wachowskis stylishly envision the ultimate in cyberescapism, creating a movie that captures the duality of life a la laptop. Though the wildest exploits befall this film's sleek hero, most of its reality is so virtual that characters spend long spells of time lying stock still with their eyes closed.In a film that's as likely to transfix fans of computer gamesmanship as to baffle anyone with quaintly humanistic notions of life on earth, the Wachowskis have synthesized a savvy visual vocabulary (thanks especially to Bill Pope's inspired techno-cinematography), a wild hodgepodge of classical references (from the biblical to Lewis Carroll) and a situation that calls for a lot of explaining.The most salient things any prospective viewer need know is that Keanu Reeves makes a strikingly chic Prada model of an action hero, that the martial arts dynamics are phenomenal (thanks to Peter Pan-type wires for flying and inventive slow-motion tricks), and that anyone bored with the notably pretentious plotting can keep busy toting up this film's debts to other futuristic science fiction. Neat tricks here echo ''Terminator'' and ''Alien'' films, ''The X-Files,'' ''Men in Black'' and ''Strange Days,'' with a strong whiff of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' in the battle royale being waged between man and computer. Nonetheless whatever recycling the brothers do here is canny enough to give ''The Matrix'' a strong identity of its own.Mr. Reeves plays a late-20th-century computer hacker whose terminal begins telling him one fateful day that he may have some sort of messianic function in deciding the fate of the world. And what that function may be is so complicated that it takes the film the better part of an hour to explain. Dubbed Neo (in a film whose similarly portentous character names include Morpheus and Trinity, with a time-traveling vehicle called Nebuchadnezzar), the hacker is gradually made to understand that everything he imagines to be real is actually the handiwork of 21st-century computers. These computers have subverted human beings into batterylike energy sources confined to pods, and they can be stopped only by a savior modestly known as the One.We know even before Neo does that his role in saving the human race will be a biggie. (But on the evidence of Mr. Reeves's beautiful, equally androgynous co-star, Carrie-Anne Moss in Helmut Newton cat-woman mode, propagating in the future looks to be all business.) The film happily leads him through varying states of awareness, much of it explained by Laurence Fishburne in the film's philosophical-mentor role. Mr. Fishburne's Morpheus does what he can to explain how the villain of a film can be ''a neural interactive simulation'' and that the Matrix is everywhere, enforced by sinister morphing figures in suits and sunglasses. ''The Matrix'' is the kind of film in which sunglasses are an integral part of sleekly staged fight scenes.With enough visual bravado to sustain a steady element of surprise (even when the film's most important Oracle turns out to be a grandmotherly type who bakes cookies and has magnets on her refrigerator), ''The Matrix'' makes particular virtues out of eerily inhuman lighting effects, lightning-fast virtual scene changes (as when Neo wishes for guns and thousands of them suddenly appear) and the martial arts stunts that are its single strongest selling point. As supervised by Yuen Wo Ping, these airborne sequences bring Hong Kong action style home to audiences in a mainstream American adventure with big prospects as a cult classic and with the future very much in mind.	5.0	The Best Sci-Fi Movie in quite sometime.	2014-04-02	0	0	0

The Director, and the rest of the support group did an excellent job with putting the film together.  If they would have hired any other man  to play Morphus it would have been a tragedy.  Mr Fishburne did and  excellent job in his portrayal.  The rest of the cast also did an excellent  job. Just watching this movie once is not enough!  The best part of the  whole movie to me was in the end when Neo looked down the hall in the  apartment building and the only thing he saw was numbers, and letters, aka  the Matrix.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1IMATCDDU5JJF	"""henna"""	I saw this movie first on the big screen I was pretty keen, soI guess I had very high expectations, Imagine how disappointed I wasto discover that this film was far from being the great movie I had desperately hoped it would be, the only other films to get my hopes so disappointingly high was BLAIR WITCH and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS, although the Matrix is nowhere near as bad/rotten/stupid/or as pathetic as those movies are, (theyre in a class of their own).Their were a few good points that drew me to the movie, like the Special FX and the action scenes, the opening with Carrie Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving was simply brilliant, even though it looked very similar to certain scenes in BLADE actually quite alot of the action scenes seemed to be inspired by BLADE and THE CROW (I wonder why that is? If youve seen BLADE then you will know what I mean! ) Laurence Fishburne is always watchable though his scifi choices havent always been good, do you remember EVENT HORIZON?  I think his talent was wasted or perhaps he could have had a better co-star, not Keanu!Anyway because I liked some of it I decided to give the Matrix another chance, I got it out again on DVD, which is chock full of Extras that are pretty cool, I watched how the actors prepared for their more grueling scenes and began to appreciate the movie on a different level, getting more insight into how hard everyone worked to get this movie up on the big screen I guess it made me more sympathetic, even though I still cringe at Keanus performance, and roll my eyes at some corny scenes with Carrie saying lovey dovey words of encouragement to Neo, I have to say I disliked it less than when I watched it the first time, which is something I guess.I wont discourage anyone from watching it, go see it and find out for yourself make up your own mind, as for me Id rather buy BLADE much more entertaining. By the way did you know that the DVD version has some hidden extras (or 'Easter Eggs as theyre more commonly known, although technically this isnt a real 'Easter Egg') theyre not obviously advertised on the package see if you can find them!	2.0	1 STAR FOR DVD EXTRAS AND 1 STAR FOR EVERYONE BUT KEANU! ! !	2000-06-30	7	2	5

But what convinced me was a single shot: the falling, in slow motion, of scintillating spent shell casings from the helicopter, during the rescue of Morpheus.  It was then that it hit me: the Wachowski brothers were not giving us that shot in order to pump up the violence/action.  They were doing it because they intuitively understood the sheer, unadorned beauty of violence.2007 UPDATE TO REVIEW TO MY 2000 REVIEW: People can be properly disappointed with the second and third installments of The Matrix saga.  They didn't live up to the hype and expectation generated from the original.  Fair enough, but don't blame the original for the fact that the follow-through was so weak.

It is all around us ...It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind from the truth . And the truth is the answer behind Neo' s intriguing question  is : that you are a slave. Like everyone else you were born in bondage , born into a prison that you can not smell or taste or touch . A prison for your mind . Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is . You have to see  it for yourself.And the Agent Smith says to Morpheus: ... Billions of people just living their lives ...oblivious. But I believe the human beings define reality through suffering and the misery. The perfect world was a ream that your primitiove cerebrum keep trying to wake up from. Why is why the Matrix was re-designed to this: the peak of your civilization.Ignorance is bliss says the Cypher accompanied of a smooth melody played by a harp .The film has multiple readings but to my mind you have to go to Dostoievski and the Great Inquirer - the free will- and William Blake can give us important references to understand the real state of the things in which we are immersed. This clever puzzle of images and illusions where you can be living the otherness of yourself and not your real bliss and unless you do not realize,  you can wake up easily of this dream at seventy when nothing can be done .

0790745399	The Matrix	A68JOU4GHD820	Howard S. Shubs	This movie is, simply speaking, the best cyberpunk-like production performed so far. It's exquisitely executed. I've watched it and as much of the DVD as I can so far and it stands up to viewing after viewing. New aspects keep popping up. Detail keeps unfolding further. The bare story is pretty darn good too.The premise is believable, the acting is superb, we get to watch Carrie-Anne Moss in tight latex (or whatever), and the effects are just unreal. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do so as soon as you can. It's just a really wild story.	5.0	Operator...	2000-06-06	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A24HN75R518Y5M	"H. Suchman ""has422"""	I KNEW all those years of hard-core video game playing would be worth it in the end. It turns out that the world as we know it is actually a super-realistic online computer game and I HAVE THE BEST CHARACTER!!! Not only that, but my video-game playing prowess impresses the ladies so much so that super-models fall hopelessly in love with me after only just meeting me!Life is good.As you may have already guessed I don't find the premise of this movie particulary original or thought-provoking. Sorry, but using your computer-hacking skills to kill twenty or thirty innocent security guards doesn't make you a hero in my book, no matter how cool you look doing it. The acting stinks, and its obvious that the plot's only purpose in this movie is to loosely connect the really cool fight scenes, which are easily the most original part of the movie. Still, while the superhuman leaping and springing were a fresh look two years ago, the technique has become SO overdone in action movies lately that it no longer impresses but rather annoys. I'd MUCH rather see a real martial arts expert show off his (or her) stuff than some CGI-enhanced pretty-boy attached to wires, but maybe that's just me.Anyway, it's a decent action flick and worth watching, but ceratinly not the be-all and end-all of the genre.	3.0	At last!

0790745399	The Matrix	A2ICW5OUWX2A2V	Ian	Ah yes, the classic Matrix.  You can truly call this movie one of the most influencial movies of the past ten years, dazzling all with it's amazing special effects, its amazing plot and top notch action sequences.  Now that all three movies are finished and released on DVD, I thought I'd take an in-depth look at all three movies and how they work together.My experience with the Matrix did not really begin until the third movie was released on DVD.  I decided to see what everyone was talking about and find out what this whole Matrix thingy was.  When I first saw the Matrix on DVD, I was stunned.  The movie presented a plot that was very Sci-Fi, yet at the same time there was a horrible possibility that it was entirly possible.  If a movie makes you question your own reality, then its bound to be a pretty influencial movie.The things that stuck with me the most after watching the movie for the first time was the action and the enormously cool agents.  But after watching the movie multiple times I've come to appreciate little things.  How the crew of the Neb is a small collective group of people from different backgrounds come together for a common cause.  How we can identify with Cypher, because lets face it, the Matrix is a lot nicer then the cold hard real world.  I also liked how Neo eventually accepted who he was and what he could do (interesting fact:  Neo does not say anything over five lines long until the end of the movie).  The action sequences are of course top notch and hold up quite well five years later, except that the sentinels look a bit plain and cheap.The Matrix will probably be remembered as the start of one of the hottest debated trilogies in movie history (Along with the Star wars prequels).  On its own, its an incredibly good movie that's well worth seeing.	5.0	Everything that has an end has a beginning	2004-10-12	1	1	0

The visual appeal, the blue-greenish toning, the sound, the atmosphere, the darkness: The Matrix looks beautiful.But there's more : the sexy voice  of Lawrence Fishburn, the cool and emancipated Carrie-Ann Moss (The line  &quot;Dodge This&quot; is the coolest line a chick has said in a film for a  long time!), and of course my personal favourite : AGENT SMITH. He plays  without a doubt the best part in the film, particularly when he gives  Morpheus the lecture about the human race being a disease.

Visually, this movie cannot be beat.Also, I think Marcus Chong deserved more notable billing for his portrayal as Tank.  He made the movie, in my opinion.The directing is great.  The angle shown of the agent dodging bullets differed from the hero doing the same thing, and this added to the suspense and the concern for the hero.The story is a bit on the dark side, without one conclusively knowing who survived except for Neo (Keanu Reeves).  This movie had spiritual overtones that I want to comment on.In an internet group I'm on, someone compared this movie with the Chronicles of Narnia, and said this movie was more Christian than Lewis' classic series.  Having seen the movie, I really disagree.This movie fits into a relativistic mindset.  There are no absolutes.  The oracle told Neo ""what he needed to hear"", but that turned out to be a lie.  Neo definitely fits into a substitute Messiah, having skills the others do not have.  The ideal, though, is to be antinomian, that is, without rules.  This is contrary to Biblical Christianity.Just my thoughts."	5.0	Technically, this movie can't be beaten.  But what is it's message?	2008-04-20	3	1	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A2L74HKRTUQOE5	"""indianaperson"""	This is a great movie, especially for sci-fi lovers. What if the world we live in isn't real, but it's just a computer simulation created by violent machines in order to keep us calm while they secretly enslave us? No, I'm not crazy. This is the set-up for &quot;The Matrix,&quot; which cleverly twists reality. Mind-bending special effects add to the already clever, original plotline. Keanu Reeves, often a very underrated actor, stars a Neo, the possible savior of humankind from machine-enslavement. Laurence Fishburne, who sounds a lot like James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, is Morpheus, the leader of a group fighting the machines. Carrie-Anne Moss, in her first big Hollywood hit, scored big as Trinity, the female fighter aboard the ship/Neo's eventual love interest. All actors, who did most of their own stuntwork, pull of their characters better than most actors could manage in a film that highlights its flashy special effects. Have I mentioned that Keanu Reeves is great in this? Have I mentioned that he looks hot being great in this? Directed by the Wachowski brothers, &quot;The Matrix,&quot; along with all it's special features on DVD, will show you something you've never seen before, and make you think about something you've never thought about before.

0790745399	The Matrix	A319SKSB556033	"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews"""	I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with important parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk genre starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.It does deliver a lot of potential (that the sequels failed to honor) and has been influential on post-modern action but no matter how much I know The Matrix is loved I just can't get over the fact that I've seen most of it in other movies. It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie. A contradiction in terms yes, but still the most appropriate way of describing it.I only bought this DVD because it was super-cheap and came in a new purple keep-case instead of the flimsy old snappers.

0790745399	The Matrix	AOIPPEZ66R2UP	"Into ""voidness"""	My god--over 2,000 reviews for this movie!?...and most of them raves? Maybe we really do live in a society run by artificial intelligence, as this grossly overrated movie's convoluted plot suggests.There were some promising ideas in this movie, such as the notion that artificial intelligence evolved from humankind's own creation, into nature's way of eliminating the blight that humankind has become on mother earth. Fascinating concept, but with its glut of overblown special effects ultimately lapsing into SciFi cheese, and plot turns folding in on themselves until they collapse under their own weight, this movie was just another glaring example of Hollywood 2000: self indulgent FX, convolluted plots, mostly crummy music, and a movie at least a half hour too long for its storyline, finally culminating in a lousy ending. When Hollywood finally learns that &quot;less is more&quot; it may very well be one of the final signs of the apocalypse. Sometimes I long for the days when they could make a good 90-minute movie (and I'm really not that old).This movie actually got my interest back, and lost it again, at least twice over the course of the circuitous storyline, but too often fell back on old SciFi cliches, lengthy explanatory soliloquys to TELL what the convoluted plot couldn't possibly SHOW, and flashy special FX, all of which made me long for one of those good old half hour Twilight Zone, &quot;is reality just a dream&quot; episodes.  I am not nearly as much of a movie buff as my wife (she thought it sucked, too, though), and my idea of good SciFi is old TZ, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Planet of the Apes, but I think this is may be the worst SciFi movie I've seen in at least 20 years.At one point, at just before the two hour mark in the movie, I said to my wife, who was almost dozing by that time, &quot;Okay, this has almost become a decent movie, but if it goes on for another half hour, it sucks.&quot; She said, &quot;You know it will, they're not going to end it here.&quot; Sure enough, a half hour later I'm looking at another stupid, non sequitur Hollywood ending--all-too-appropriately accompanied by some &quot;Nu Metal&quot; crap for end title music. What I find much more societally unsettling than this movie's scenario, is that so many people thought this movie was great. I wonder how many of those people were able to follow the storyline at all; and how many just liked it because of the glut of FX, the idea of artificial intelligence taking over reality, and yet another in a long line of Nu Metal and Industrial-dominated soundtracks. The REAL Matrix is an entertainment industry that keeps feeding stuff like this to an audience that just keeps mindlessly saying, &quot;Thank you, sir, might I have another?&quot;	1.0	This movie had possibilities, but ultimately...it sucked!	2001-05-15	45	21	24

When it was in theatres my sister and I went to see it, not once, not twice but Four Times! When it was released on video and DVD we knew we had to get it, and believe it or not, we got it on both formats. (We have DVD on our home computer but since the screen is small we also wanted a version we could watch on our large screen T.V. Oh well!) We are definitely hooked on the Matrix. It is action packed and it has a story that leaves you scratching your head and wondering ""What if?"" long after you see the film. Keanu Reeves was made for the Matrix or perhaps the Matrix was made for Keanu, whatever, the point is that he is perfect in his role as the reluctant hero Neo. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is the perfect female role model, she's beautiful, she's feminine, she knows how to take command of a situation and she kicks major you-know-what. The more times I see this movie, the more I grow to love it and the more questions I have. The Wachowski brothers have outdone themselves with this gem of a film and I can hardly wait for parts 2 and 3 to come out in theaters.If you don't own a DVD then you must run out and get one. Although it is OK to see it on video, the DVD version has so much more to offer and the special effects were meant to be seen on a digital format.

What makes this science-fiction flick diffrent from the rest of the movies out there  is that it's got vision. Larry and Andy Waichowski (ever seen bound? If not, go and get it!) have come up with something entirely new in essence, even though they have borrowed and/or been inspired by countless different sources, ranging from philosophers to cyber-punk authors and even mathematics, to some extent. Fair enough, as they never really made a secret out of it. Don't get me wrong, there's some serious thinking going on there.The visual effect is stunning the (in-) famous bullit time being just one of the oscar-winning special effects specially developed for this movie. The soundtrack, the casting and the equipment (who can't remember the black glasses, long coats and thight, shiny suits?) make what would have been a good movie exeptional.Keanu Reeves, who's not exactly known for his acting skills, just seems to be made for his role of Neo, a confused ex-computer-nerd-turned-superhero who doesn't talk to much, and truly kicks but. Laurence Fishburn does a great performance as Morpheus, his voice nearly hipnotizes you into believing what he's telling you about ""the world not really being what it seems"". Scary. One of the best performances is delievered by Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity, she really gets the right mix of vunerability, beaty, and toughness, and delivers some of the best lines in the movie.Whatever you say about the ""good guys"", the ""bad guys"" really bring it to life. Hugo Weaving is very convincing as Agent Smith, a machine slowly developing weard human feelings, what doesn't make him more likeable, thank god.And look out for Joe Pantoliano as Cyprus (I love his acting) and, oh yeah, the Oracle!"	5.0	The best!	2003-08-05	2	2	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A34A095NNHFMB5	Jack Felson	"Of course the movie is good, with much suspense and movement, the special effects are great as usual, Keanu Reeves is very, very charming... But we can't keep saying that kind of thing. So I'm gonna put some middle critics about it. And there's quite much to say.The Wachowski brothers are fond of John Woo, kung-fu movies and mangas, and we can see that. We can see that so well that in fact nobody saw nothing at all. Actually the movie's been made under the entire influence of Hong Kong cinema. Open your eyes and you'll see that the story itself is taken from the famous Japanese manga and film ""Ghost in the Shell"" (a hacker pursuited by an overpowerful cyber-agent - doesn't this remind you something?). Open your eyes and you'll see that the action, shooting sequences have been taken from John Woo movies, especially ""A better Tomorrow"" and ""The Killer"" (Keanu Reeves throwing his empty guns away and replacing them, imitating Chow Yun-Fat). Open your eyes and you'll see that the fighting sequences have been taken from Hong Kong kung-fu movies, especially Tsui Hark ones (""Once upon a Time in China 1 & 2"", with Jet Li); besides they've been made by a famous Hong Kong choreographer... the same one who worked on the Hark movies, and on ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""!As we know, Hollywood has become a master place in the art of imitation and recovery. With ""The Matrix"", the big shots can say they made a totally innovative movie (some others said 'the best sci-fi movie ever made') which's gonna be inspiring many unimaginative directors in the future (see ""The One""). But they forgot (and not only them) that the movie itself owes Asian cinema very much, if not everything. For me ""The Matrix"" is not a new and innovative film, but a smart pack of sequences already seen before in other movies made a very long distance away from Hollywood. But people don't care, so we can say that the Wachowski brothers did it great. In any case the movie doesn't worth ""Blade Runner"" and other great futuristic movies ""The Matrix"" unsuccessfully tried to bury.About the actors, I noticed Hugo Weaving's amazing performance as the brutal, ferocious, pitiless agent Smith. He manages to keep away from caricature and makes his bad character one of the most believable and scary ones, in action movie history. But when I see him fighting and flying all over around in a perfect, high-class suit, I have some doubts. All I can say is that in the end, Neo can't do anything else but crush him when he at last gets aware of his great powers. Lawrence Fishburne, as the charismatic Morpheus, is excellent too.So I'll say that after their very personal and imaginative first film, ""Bound"", the Wachowski brothers, as many others like Bryan Singer, blew up their style and sold their souls to Hollywood. ""The Matrix"" is quite a good movie with a good plot borrowed from mangas but with a too obvious influence of the kung-fu, John Woo and manga styles, and with a bouddhist background (Morpheus' speeches). There's nothing much to be deadly admirative about. The special effects are perfect but too present and heavy and bring bad headache, along with the deafening music.

0790745399	The Matrix	A24UV965H6SP8	Jack Frosch	Synopsis: A premiere sci-fi film with a lot of action and a thought-provoking premiseOverall Entertainment Value: ExcellentViolence: Abundant, but not goryPlot: Thought provoking, but  not high brow or preachySpecial Effects: Well Done and Visually  CompellingSuitable For Age: Mature 16Few movies compel me to watch  them more than once. Fewer still can completely hold my interest a second  time. This is one of the rare movies that I can enjoy every few  months.Like Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and even Star Trek/Star  Trek NG, The Matrix invites you to examine your notions of what being  &quot;alive&quot; means.Ironically, the special effects that draw you  into accepting the reality of The Matrix ultimately support a plot that  forces you to challenge any notion you may have about objective reality.  How do you *know* your reality is *the* reality?No, it's not some high  brow intellectual art film; and yes, its violence, while not gory, is  abundant.  This is not a movie for early teens!Nonetheless, if you come  away from it without wondering about the relationship between perception  and reality (or whether objective reality can be proven at all!), then  you'll have missed the point. If so, just go back to watching reruns of  Seinfeld - and other shows that are proudly about nothing at all.For the  rest of you, buy this on DVD because I suspect a VHS tape will wear out  before your interest in this movie.	5.0	Entertaining, Thought-Provoking, Compelling	1999-11-25	39	32	7
0790745399	The Matrix	AZ8ZPDUHIVNUX	"""jackiechanfan24"""	I didnt want to see this movie at first.  It looked dark and dull.  Then I saw a preview with some Kung fu action and then I made it a weekend thing.  I saw it 3 out of the 4 opening weekend days it was playing!  I love this movie.  The plot you can follow and the cast is great in roles which could seem somewhat silly at times.The most pivotal thing for me in this film is REAL actors doing REALLY good kung-fu action/fight scenes!  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburn, Hugo Weaving, and Carrie Ann Moss all spent 4 months training with one of the best martial arts directors in cinema history.  It shows!  The fight scenes are amazing if they do suffer from a bit too much wire work for my tastes.There is also the stunning visual effects utilizing a brand new method of film making.  They have to be seen being put together in the documentary on this disc.  Also a key on this dvd is the white rabbit feature which allows you to see how certain scenes were filmed and put together.There is a not-so subtle use of green through out the film, aside from this is one of the best films of 1999.  A must see for just about any movie fan!	5.0	Stunning Mindblowing	2001-07-18	1	0	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A3SQ5LI1Y8SK6J	Jackie Tortorella	What can I say after so many reviews have been posted, except this was one of the very finest movies I have ever seen!  It ranks right with the original Star Wars Trilogy.  The special effects are breathtaking...the action kept my nerves taut throughout...the characters were magnificent--especially the terrific acting job of Laurence Fishburne.  I'm much more of a reader than a movie watcher, and boy do I ever wish this had first been a novel.  I can't believe it has taken me so long to see this movie--the instant it ended I rushed to the computer to order the 2nd and 3rd in the trilogy.  For a most memorable time, you can't go wrong with this movie.  Don't just watch it--experience it!	5.0	Bring back the 10-star rating!	2004-04-02	2	0	2

0790745399	The Matrix	A1GBMGSDDG7BFL	James Crouch	I first saw The Matrix the day it premiered in theaters, after I saw a preview that peaked my interest in the movie. I have since seen the movie well over a hundred times (no kidding, really)and I never get tired of seeing it. The Wachowski Brothers have succeeded in making one of the most fresh and innovative Sci-fi/action movies ever made, with a gripping storyline, nonstop action, and stellar acting performances across the board.  I've often heard people talk about Keanu Reeves' lack of acting ability, but he plays the part of Thomas Anderson/Neo to perfection in what I consider by far the finest performance of his career. Reeves portrays an early sense of doubt and disbelief very convincingly, and makes a smooth transition throughout the film as he comes to terms with the &quot;real world&quot; and his struggle to save it. Laurence Fishburne,(Morpheus, the leader of the human resistence) who has long been one of my favorite actors, delivers another riveting performance as his charisma and strong presence shine through in this movie. His interplay with Reeves is especially good, as he helps propel the film's suspenseful moments. Carrie-Anne Moss delivers a breakthrough role as Trinity, a member of Morpheus' crew as well as Neo's eventual love interest. The rest of the cast also deliver excellent performances,  as they play their supporting roles to perfection.  The strong acting alone would make this a solid movie, but the script really propels this movie into the stratosphere, making The Matrix one of the most innovative stories ever created. The backdrop of Man against Machine is not brand new concept, but the idea of the enslavment of the human race in a computer-generated prison for the mind is quite new indeed. The Wachowski brothers grab the audience's attention at the very beginning of the movie by dropping the viewer directly into the action, without knowing who the &quot;bad guys&quot; and &quot;good guys&quot; really are. The movie continues forward at backbreaking pace, offering riveting plot twists, suspense-filled action sequences, and some of the best special effects ever to grace the big screen(The combination still and motion picture technology, which is used throughout the film and detalied in an included behind the scenes documentary, is absolutely amazing).  I believe that the entire DVD format was created to showcase this type of movie.(The Matrix is the top selling DVD title to date, so many people obviously agree with me) The visuals are crisp and clear, with extremely vivid images, This movie also features some of the best sound possible, as bone-jarring explosions and ferocious fight scenes are heard like never before in full Dolby 5.1 surround. The behind the scenes documentaries are fascinating, and the disc is also packed with loads of other extras that will satisfy any Matrix fan.  The bottom line is this: The Matrix is one of the most innovative movies ever made, backed by excellent acting performances, an incredible script, as well as special effects that set a new standard in the motion picture industry. This movie will be remembered for years to come. I am one of the multitudes of fans who eagerly await the sequel(and for once I have greater expectations for the sequel than I did for the original). The Matrix is an instant classic, a movie truly fashioned for the computer age.	5.0	Imagination, Suspense, Action...The Matrix has it all!	2000-10-27	16	12	4

0790745399	The Matrix	AQM361LV5OWBZ	James J. Allman jr.	A very slick, clever movie though not as profound as many would have you believe. The story is a familiar one - a man is the chosen one but must discover and believe in himself first - but the backdrop for it is vastly  more interesting than most similar movies and the special effects are both  excellent and well-used. There's a lot that is hastily explained and a  pretty pointless, romantic subplot but, depending on what you expect from  an action/adventure/scifi movie,  there's nothing that detracts from it too  much. For those that enjoy the genre, I certainly recommend it.	3.0	A good, entertaining movie	1999-12-20	6	6	0

I love martial arts and ground-breaking special effects,  and this movie combined the two with a suspenseful story and characters  that I cared about. The acting was, I thought, very believable and  definitely above average for an action movie. The LD has, I believe, the  same documentaries that are on the DVD and I enjoyed watching those as  well.

Then when the dvd came out, I decided to buy it saying what the heck, I liked the movie. There is so much  more to it. You really have to see the movie more than once to capture it  all in. The sound is made for home theatre and the picture quality is  brillant. Also it's full of extras which enhance the viewing expierence.  The behind the scenes feature is great and just basically the story is so  original which sets it apart from the cookie cutter crap which is in movies  today. I put it like a good mystery book. You just want to see more and  more. It's a great, great movie, and if someone has just bought a dvd  player or home theatre system, buy this dvd and you will never forget it.

0790745399	The Matrix	AQ01Q3070LT29	James McDonald	"Warner Brothers Pictures and Video Roadshow Pictures presents ""THE MATRIX"".What is The Matrix?CGI effects were still brand new to filmmaking.  How could the computer-effects used in Twister (1996) and The Haunting (1999) ever be topped? A visual effect of two people fighting one man in a karate position suddenly (froze) stood still, the camera pans 360 degrees around the man as he is bend over backwards with moving bullets.  This scene was the ""catch"" of the film.Since The Matrix release March 31, 1999, countless films have tried to copy these visual effects, Charlie's Angels (2000), Scary Movie (2000) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000).  The Matirx was the original first.As Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) sits patiently in an apartment, the police bust in. She fights them off with karate moves that not even Bruce Lee could do. The chase is on as she runs from the police a la VERTIGO (1958) and THE CROW (1994) like Brandon Lee.  She's not Batgirl, but obviously she has the superhuman strength.  Now she has Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) on her tail.  She must run to the payphone to answer it.A new subject is needed. Neo (Keanu Reeves) wakes up. His computer displays for him to wake up and has written, ""The Matrix has you..."" ""Follow the white rabbit""  ""Knock, Knock"".  There are two knocks on the door.Later, Neo meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who needs him to enter The Matrix.  Like KUNG FU (1972, 1972-75), Neo is trained by Morpheus inside the Matrix to be on the look out for Agent Smith.  He is a killer.  Neo's mission is to save the world, but first he must meet the one that can predict...the all-knowing ""Oracle"" (Gloria Foster) who will guide him.Also in the cast: Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, Julian Arahanga.Running Time: 2 hrs. 16 min.Easter Egg #1: Click, ""Special Features"", click ""Cast & Crew"", Click on ""Written & Directed by the Waachowski Brothers"".

0790745399	The Matrix	A12VALUJPC0E	James W. Taylor	The Matrix is a movie that is good, but could have been so much better.  Essentially they needed a plot that could carry the main point of the movie: show awesome special effects that are not possible in the real  world.  Main point achieved.  This movie has some truly remarkable scenes  that left me stunned.However, good dialogue and plot could have really  carried this movie to a whole new level.  Without giving away the central  idea, the secret of &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot; is silly.  There are  many reasonable alternatives that could have made the movie more believable  and even thought-provoking (I bet you can think of at least three).  As it  is, whenever people talk, sense they do not make.See this movie, because  it is fun.  That said, it was painful for me to watch this movie a second  time knowing what it could have been.	3.0	Enjoyable but could be better	2000-07-08	6	1	5

Basically the film is a sci-fi action movie, I would recomend watching the trailer as it doesn't spoil the movie as some do. The  plot Basically is as Lawrence fishburn says &quot;What is the differnce  between the real world and a dream world, and how to we know when we wake  from that dream ?&quot; The film is based upon that our life is all a  computer program and we are connected to the program living a &quot;dream  life&quot;. Some people compare this film to &quot;dark city&quot; but  really it has everything that Dark City doesn't if you have seen dark city  and you liked it or didn't like it then you will love this movie its awsome  !

0790745399	The Matrix	AMN010NPLJW4X	Jamison	"I recommend The Matrix on Blu-ray, as does blu-ray(dot)com.  4.5 out of 5 stars.A/V. The 1080p video quality is excellent.  I don't know if it was remastered for BD because the DVD quality is great too.  The audio in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 is also excellent; the best feature of this disk. The Matrix won Academy Awards for best sound and best sound effects editing in 1999.DELIVERY. Good menu interactivity.  The booklet has grainy pictures and typical bios of the stars, trivia, and an egotistical essay.  Sub-par graphic design.SUPPLEMENTS. The are several entertaining SD supplements which have been described elsewhere, they are mostly the same as on DVD.  There is one unusual supplement, ""The Music Revisited,"" that is a massive collection of songs, almost entirely electronica or ambient music.  The ""In-movie Experience"" shows PIP selections from the special features as the film plays, which is great, except for the permanent logo in the upper-left corner of the screen, which could cause burn-in on some displays.  Another trait the Wachowski brothers share with the Coen brothers is that they don't like to talk about their movies, so there is no commentary from them here.  An interesting replacement are commentary tracks by philosophers, another by critics, another by a small group of cast/crew, and one by the composer."	4.0	The Matrix 10th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray	2009-06-20	4	3	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A1DRMP5IVGIGPR	"Jane E. Nicholson ""Jane"""	The Matrix is one of those movies that is either loved or despised.  The story is a pretty ordinary tale of a person who is unaware that he is destined to save humanity.  (Keanu Reeves is excellent as a man who is  never quite sure what is going on.)The setting is imaginative and well  portrayed, although not groundbreaking.  The special effects, however, most  certainly are.  The DVD contains a behind-the-scenes look at how those  freeze 'em then spin 'em in the air scenes were created.I'm still not  completely sure why, but the combination of special effects and original  setting goes to make this movie compulsive viewing.	5.0	A favourite of mine	2000-05-24	1	1	0

Never mind Jean Paul Sartre. As Neo (Keanu Reeves) is introduced to existentialism and begins to grasp its power, the viewer is brought along for the ride. His and our reactions are one in the same. The directors use Neo as a surrogate for the viewer, our reaction and his are identical and summed up in his powerful use of ""...whoa"" at multiple points.Carrie Anne Moss brings great depth to her character and her acting is positively superb. The range of emotion which she displays is absolutely phenomena. I'm really not sure why she didn't win any awards for her portrayal of Trinity. She definitely deserved it. The Oscars are just one big popularity contest and are in thrall to the politics of the Hollywood establishment. They just couldn't handle the questioning of authority which forms the basis of this film. The real issue is that they didn't dig deeper, it wasn't a film saying ""screw the system"" it was a film that challenges the viewer to question the reality (unreality) of the world around them.Overall an amazing movie. A must for people just getting into existentialism and a treat for people who are already having existential crises. And if you aren't having an existential crisis, this film will bring you to the point of unbridled terror that everything you have ever known is a lie."	5.0	Great Portrayal of Existentialism	2012-11-04	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A2ORZYOH2IRT9W	Jason Dodge	"Shortly following the DVD release of the first ""Matrix"" film, Warner Bros. used a smaller studio called Creative Design Art to make a specially designed package to help promote their incredibly successful movie. Their first result was this, the ""Platinum Limited Edition DVD Collector's Set,"" which originally retailed for $79 (or close to that). In my opinion, even if you're a hardcore fan of the Matrix films, this packagejust isn't worth the money, It comes in a box about two-inches thick, which makes you think you're really getting your money's worth, but as soon as you open it up -- you become disappointed. Most of this packaging is taken up by a flimsy plastic tray that contains a 35mm celluloid film frame of  with a nice blown-up photo. Then there are 8 ""limited edition"" lobby cards prints (which are really just postcard-sized stills from the movie), a full-sized poster, and the the same copy of the family you probably already own -- in the standard DVD keep-case (the cheapist kind of DVD packaging). All of the other extras mentioned in this package (full-length audio commentary, ""Take The Red Pill"" featurette) are the same features found in original DVD release. Although it's Out-Of-Print now, I've noticed you can get one used for around $20, which isn't too bad, but it's probably not even worth the effort if you already own the first movie on DVD.Warner Bros. wasn't entirely pleased with the sales generated from the Platinum Limited Edition, so they asked Creative Design Art to create a more definitive version for consumers to buy. Their second project was ""The Matrix / The Matrix Revisited (The Gold Edition)"" which retailed for $100 (and can also be found on Amazon.com). The one advantage of this new package was that it also contained the just-released 163-minute behind-the-scenes DVD ""The Matrix Revisited"" along with the original movie, but it also has a few ""carryovers"" from Creative Design's last project (namely, the senitype image from the movie, and a 35mm film frame). The cheap plastic insert from before has now been replaced with a luxury fitted slipcase, and a 16-page commemorative book. But still, all of the features found on the same previously-released DVDs are found here. Aside from the packaging, there's no additional footage whatsoever, whether it's in the form of deleted scenes or bonus videos. The film frame doesn't even have ""Dolby Digital"" printed on it like it's supposed to, which means that it's not even a real frame of film (because that would cost the publisher money) -- it's just a cheap no-sound fabrication.Eventually, Warner Bros. would release a definitive collection of their own instead of using a third-party, entitled ""The Ultimate Matrix Collection"" which is the 10-disc DVD box-set of all the movies and their corresponding ""Revisited"" features, plus more. Even better, you can get the ultimate collection for around $30 used on Amazon.com. Actual film frames are somewhat interesting, but if you don't really care about that kind of thing, then just get  the ""Ultimate Matrix Collection."" You really do get a lot more for your money."	1.0	"Get the ""Ultimate Matrix Collection"" instead, It's cheaper and has more features."	2006-03-07	17	6	11

0790745399	The Matrix	A3MS9714Z1YY6E	"Jasonist ""JSK"""	"""No one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it yourself,"" exclaims Morpheus. Indeed, you have to see it. Suggest that the DVD itself is the red-pill; by purchasing this, you are gulping down that red pill with an icy cup of water and you are tumbling down into the computerized rabbit hole, the Matrix. Ultimately, you get to join the unbelievable quest of Neo once again, dodging bullets, doing Kung fu kicks and finally, wearing a good-looking outfit and a cool pair of sunglasses.The movie The Matrix, created by the Wachowski brothers Andy and Larry, is one of the best science fiction movies out there. While other sci-fi movies are filled with cute beeping sounds of robots and zaps of laser guns which have been repeated so much that it is almost disgusting, this movie decides to portrays a closer, a more plausible reality, a reality where humans are defeated by A.I (artificial intelligence) and are trapped unknowingly in a virtual reality named Matrix. It is a feast to the eyes with its impressive graphics including the ever so popular `Bullet-time"", while it also manages to grasp the audience with a very philosophic and religious tale about a Messiah of computer programs.The story begins with the introduction of Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), who lives a striking double-life; at morning he stays as the typical Mr. Anderson and works for MetaCortex, a major software company. At night, he prefers being Neo, a hacker selling illegal programs. However, he is taken custody by Agent Smith, a guardian program of the Matrix who sees Neo as a potential threat to the system. Fortunately, Neo is saved from his clasps by a band of rebels including Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who frequently wreck havoc in the Matrix system by hacking into it. From them, he realizes that the world around him actually is a computer program made by A.I robots to keep humans imprisoned in a dreamland, while their bodies are used as a means of energy sources. Neo also learns that it is he who will presumably be the One, an almighty figure powerful enough to destroy the Matrix itself. Thus begins Neo's path to brighten reality, but things get wobbly right from the beginning; there is a traitor in the midst.The Matrix is compact of greatly improved actors. Keanu Reeves, the rookie star of the action-movie ""Speed"", is done with stopping bus explosions set up by a madman. Instead, he now faces a much bigger, heavier burden; he has to rescue the whole humanity! As I watched the movie, I could not hide my amazement; Reeves seemed to have matured considerably, confronting such a humongous task of being the One. His acting of utter shock and awe as he first learns of the Matrix is thoroughly realistic; I just wondered how I would have reacted, seeing Reeves muttering ""No!"" and then falling to the ground, spinning around in shock. Carrie-Anne Moss also does a great job; she depicted Trinity's character successfully. It's interesting to see a bit of a contrast between Trinity of the real and the virtual; a soft, sincere and caring woman turns into a fiery combat machine! My heart thrilled when she said, ""Dodge this,"" shooting Agent Smith right on the head. Laurence Fishburne, as the leader of the rebels Morpheus, creates a sense of authority and acts a spiritual supporter of Neo. His gentle conversations of Neo are filled with confidence, and his voice creates a tranquilizing effect when there is great danger ahead; that is what he has his name for. Lastly, oh, I can never forget him, Hugo Weaving! He does an unbelievable job being Agent Smith, whose goal is ever so simple; to eradicate the One. ""I hate their smell!"" He cries out to Morpheus, showing his terrible dislike for humans. He is the perfect rival against Neo, also armed with a snappy suit and the strangely cruel smile of his.Also, one cannot easily go over the cinematography of the movie. The Wachowski brothers certainly make us open our mouths at the right beginning. When Trinity faces a mean-looking policeman (who is luckily not an agent), she evades his gunshots by walking sides along the wall and then leaps right infront of him. Just at this moment, time stops, and the scene is rotated 360 degrees in slow motion. And as the rotation stops, Trinity delivers a fatal kick at the policeman's head. The whole progress of this single action scene is so slow, so simple yet so beautiful. Such beauty is shown again at the scene where Neo manages to `dodge' the bullets shot from Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving)'s gun. Again, time freezes and the bullet slowly moves towards Neo, who bends his body backwards to evade the bullets. The cinematography used in this scene is so famous that it even has it's own distinctive name; ""Bullet-Time"". Ever since this movie, this method has been used by way too many other movies. Finally, I would pick the lobby battle scene as the epitome of the Wachowski brother's skills. Neo and Trinity slowly kill the policemen, doing somersaults and cartwheels, and wasting plenty of bullets, It almost glorifies violence; I didn't feel sorry for all those men being killed. I actually hummed along with the exciting music, hypnotized by such artistic fight sequences.The DVD, apart from such a masterpiece, also features a satisfactory introduction on how the movie was made. It also explains some of the cinematography involved in the movie, especially how `Bullet-time' was created. I was amazed at how the Wachowski brothers arranged at least 60 cameras around Keanu Reeves to create the effect.Despite such greatness, movies after all, are made by humans, not by robots nor the One. The Matrix does have some tiny flaws. While I watched the movie, I just had to admit that the movie was mainly created for the mass population, who are easily lured and fascinated by some tricky graphics or cool action scenes. I had hoped that the movie might focus more on the tone and seriousness of the whole situation (that robots rule the world), rather than concentrate on the video game-like fight scenes. I had hoped that the movie would really pull us into the rabbit hole and emit a strongly philosophical topic, which would permanently stay fixed on one's mind, but when the movie ended, we were forcefully popped out from the hole, and the philosophy evaporated. Though it was a good attempt, The Matrix wasn't able to satisfy people who were really puzzled about the world, whether it is real or not. Watching it is like having a soup that is neither hot nor cold; it is just `it'.Overall, The Matrix is quite an awesome movie. It presented to us a whole knew theory; that the world one is living in might not be the world that another knows, with the help of great actors. In addition, some spectacular action scenes spiced up the movie, thanks to the innovative minds of the Wachowski brother. As the first tale of the Matrix trilogy, this movie has great significance. One would be buying the DVD with the pleasure that he is going to `see' the matrix itself, ensured that he is going to enjoy it.

A balanced article on this subject--including many analogies you may have missed during the first viewing--can be found at About dot com: search for ""The Matrix and Christianity""Admittedly I am not the biggest Keanu Reeves fan but in this role he plays the clueless Neo well, and Hugo Weaving is one of modern cinema's classic villains as Mr. Smith.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2HZCDP31E5T23	Jason Pedersen	The problem with most movies lately, particularly those that fall into the action genre, is that no matter how much good story telling there is, they just don't make you think.  The Matrix contains post apocalyptic  philosiphies and theories that do just that.  The complete shock of this  movie is that it could happen, it could be true; and there are certain  paradoxes to point to this, the famous Zeno's Paradox is one of them.  Also  something that we rarly see in action films of todays generation is strong  acting, something that The Matrix is full of.  Reeves drops the  &quot;California surfer dude&quot; act and is just plain great.  Fishburn  is at his best as Neo's teacher, providing insight into his life, and ours.  The thing I must applaud the Wachowski Brothers with the most however, is  that the special effects (which are out of this world) do not drown out the  plot or actors, as is the case with every other special FX flick of the  last few years.This movie comes with the highest recommendation  possible.  It gets five stars because I couldn't give it six.	5.0	Nothing can top this movie	1999-09-07	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	AXERV7J4PIYS	Jason R. Gonzalez	"Did ""The Matrix"" change Hollywood. Maybe?I remember seeing this for the 1st time in theaters. Honestly, I only saw a couple of tv spots before seeing it, so I did not expect much. ""Just another mindless action movie"" I thought. This movie totally blew me away and then some. I was right there with Neo every step of the way. I realized at the same time Neo realized what IT was. The film had a very bladerunner/film noir type atmosphere and the music made that even better, so the movie has a good setting. The action was also pretty impressive for the time because that type of action was rarely (if ever) seen in a Hollywood movie. It was the type of thing you'd see only in Hong Kong action films or Japanese animation. And that's where the problem begins.The Matrix has been copied so many times in the past 12 years and these Matrix-like cash-ins sometimes make me forget how awesome the movie really is. If only screenwriters were inspired by the smarter-than-average script and started writing their own smart scripts. What we got instead (for more than a decade) was very mediocre movies with horrible ""matrix style"" action. The Matrix is a great movie, but I think it might be the reason why we got a crap load of silly movies.The blu-ray is wonderful. Picture quality is amazing and very sharp. I'm not happy about their decision to color correct the film so that it can match the two sequels, but it still looks very good. Sound is great as well. Most of the special features are things I have on DvD already, but there are a couple of new things like the critics' commentary and philosophers' commentary. They also made the 41 audio tracks from ""The Matrix Revisited"" easy to access; they were hidden items on ""The Matrix Revisited"" DvD.Overall, it's worth buying if you like the film and haven't gotten it on blu ray yet. 5 stars!!"	5.0	The film that changed Hollywood?	2011-10-06	1	1	0
0790745399	The Matrix	ARAJKQGTVFDHP	Jason Tweed	The Matrix got a 10 in visual appeal, originality, and special effects.  If you love movies based on incredible special effects, you'll love The Matrix.  The action sequences in this movie combine traditional stunt work  with state-of-the-art computer effects.  I was turned off by movies such as  the Phantom Menace and the Star Wars re-makes because much of the computer  animation looks like computer animation.  In The Matrix, even though they  relied heavily on animated effects that are simply impossible in our  physical world, they managed to make it believable.  It helps that the  entire plot is so unbelievable that you buy into the computer-generated  scenes.  My only regret visually, is that I missed this movie on the big  screen.The 10 in originality comes from the mere fact that I've never  seen a movie with this plot.  The hero spends the first half of the movie  trying to figure out which a reality is real.  Unlike most movies with  altered realities, they let the audience learn the truth early.  This  reality is completely different from anything most of the audience will  have seen, but completely believable.The low point of the movie was the  acting.  Once again (being kind) Mr. Reeves will not win an academy award.  Laurence Fishburne stars as the mentor of the rebel group, and is actually  quite convincing.  The highlight in my opinion was Carrie-Anne Moss.  She  is sexy and strong.  Hopefully we will see her again.	4.0	Special effects are amazing	1999-12-08	3	2	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A2LYYTITHODX6M	Jason Waitkins	Yes yes this movie was execellent, the first time.  Then I watched it again, after getting it on dvd and almost returned it.  Maybe its just me but Keanu Reeves can't act for nothing.  And what is it with people and bullet time?  Everyone says its so new and has never been done before.  Well, I hate to break it to you all, but it has.Pick ANY movie directed by John Woo, and while you won't get as much bullet time, you will get some.  To give a more obvious example, the movie IRON MONKEY that was chorieagraphed by the same people, and had as much bullet time as the matrix, well that movie was made and released in China 5 years before this movie was made.The story is also kinda hard to follow the first time.  You will need to see it at least twice.(that is not a bad thing) One thing I will say that I like about this movie are the general special effects.  And all 3 actors who play the agents do a great job.  There is also this extreamly pathetic love story, that probably would have made the movie much better had it not been there.The special features of the DVD are, well....not so special.  Its besically the Wachowski brothers talking about how they think they no it all.  The musical score on the other hand is really cool.Don't be fooled by how everyone says this movie changed the way movies are made.  If it changed anything, it changed the fact that we don't need big time famous actors to make a decent movie, just a lot of stuff blowing up and lots and lots of special effects.  I mean, I don't even think Trinity looks that pritty.If you want this movie, go ahead and get it.  But rent it once or twice first and you probably wont be watching it again.	2.0	Only an idiot would say this was revolutionary	2003-09-18	5	1	4

This is a must have if your transferring your collection to blu ray disks for the picture and sound. Im sure like all movies it will made into a new futuristic format like 3d or hologram TV who knows but you gotta know when to say when or else Hollywood just keeps feeding us the same thing over and over and we just end up that much closer to being broke than they are.	5.0	Great movie but you already knew that i was going to say that	2013-07-09	1	0	1

Not only is the plot full of mind-warping twists, the special effects will make you say &quot;How'd they do that?&quot;  If you buy the DVD version, they even included the answer to that question for curious people like us. The DVD version is chock-full of special stuff, so do yourself a favor and buy it!!If you're NOT a sci-fi junkie, then it's still worth seeing, but don't buy it until you've tried it.  The special effects alone are worth sitting through this movie.  In fact, &quot;Bullet Time,&quot; the method of filming used in a few scenes in this movie, is now being used in many other places, including a TGI Friday's commercial, &quot;Scary Movie,&quot; and I've heard even in the new &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; movie.This movie truly sets a new standard for the movie industry!	5.0	&quot;Matrix&quot; Sets New Standard For DVDs and Movies Alike!	2000-11-21	0	0	0

It`s a film in which you will be glued to from beginning to end and wanting you to press  rewind on your remote and watch it over and over again !

0790745399	The Matrix	A2RVQYZ5TN7K63	Jayson Farrell (easterzoo@aol.com)	Most aspects of this movie were not original.  The idea of everything being an illusion is old and Matrix adds little to the concept.  The character development was the worst part of the movie, and only Morpheus  was anything more than utterly shallow.  The soundtrack seemed adequate.  But...come on, people!  This movie was fun!  Like Star Wars 20 years  before, Matrix draws on many cultural elements and ideas and weaves them  together in a wholy original, well-executed manner.  The result is at the  very least refreshing, often creative, and always engaging.  The parallels  to Star Wars go further.  There is a rich, compelling universe; a hero  gifted with supernatural powers; top-notch special effects; and finally a  background with a cheesy, but still meaningful and well-delivered message.  It is the synthesis, not the parts, that make Matrix original (and more  than a simple action movie).To me, a good movie is one that compells  additional viewings and strives for originality.  The Matrix acheives this  at a level rarely matched in this decade.	5.0	Art on the level of Star Wars.	1999-08-27	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	ACMZJ32N0R5KV	Jay Waters	"The Matrix fandom is heavily divided between those who loved the entire trilogy and those who regard the first one as a true classic with two sub-par follow-ups. Whatever side you support, there's no denying that the first Matrix is indeed a classic that revolutionized the industry and raised the bar on many layers (from special effects and sound to editing). It's a well paced, action packed, philosophical science fiction master piece.If you already own the collection on DVD, this is the one ""must"" to upgrade to Hi-Definition. It looks and sounds superb on Blu-Ray and it has all the special features (related only to the first movie) that come in the collector's set plus a color booklet.The digibook package hasn't been received with unconditional love by everyone, but it does give a ""special edition feel"" and provides decent protection to the disc.Some people will prefer ""The Ultimate Matrix Collection"", but for those of us who loved the original the most and are unwilling to pay upgrades for everything, this is the edition to get."	5.0	The Original Matrix in Full HD Glory	2009-10-27	11	11	0

It is a profound metaphor for what humanity *is* and what we can be. The action in it has of course changed movie making for years to come, but really the action is there in my opinion to get the message out to the masses. If you think this view is a little off just think of it this way. The Matrix, Agents and the machines are all analogies of societies/religions/cultures programming on the human mind and how they keep us under control. If one frees himself of this programming from both the outward matrix and the controls within (Agents) then one becomes ""free"" to change the world as they see fit.As for the sequels, they were not needed.

0790745399	The Matrix	A6DH4F9ACJ62F	J. Berry	Let's be serious. With 1300-odd customer reviews, I'm not exactly going to tell you anything new about the Matrix, except that most of what you've heard is true. It's impossible to have the entire concept of the movie  explained to you coherently, there's a fair amount of violence and the  effects are just stunning. The basic story is that Keanu Reeves - who, by  the way, comes alive for the first time in his acting career in this movie  - discovers that the world he lives in is an illusion, and that with the  help of Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss has to free humankind from  slavery. It's been done before, granted, but not with as much polish and  the philosophy of the film is very forward. I just have one last thing to  add . . . own up, everyone who's seen it: how many of you tried the trick  with the spoon afterwards?	5.0	Great philosophy, and Keanu Reeves actually acts	1999-12-30	1	1	0

I don't want to give anything away  but take my word for it &quot;The Matrix&quot; really gives you a chill  with the situation it proposes for humanity.I highly recommend  viewing this film if you haven't already, and if you have well you know  what I am talking about and should probably watch it again.	5.0	What a film!	2000-01-03	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A1PP6TSNECELE4	J. Center	Fans of writers Phil Dick and William Burroughs will love the paranoia deep at the heart of this stylish movie.  With a palette whose major color  is a weird shade of black-green, the Wachowski brothers have made an  intelligent, thought-provoking action flick -- a genuine rarity.  Oh,  there's one too many action cliches, and Keanu Reeves' acting is as close  to dead as you'll see onscreen, but there's a lot to like here too.  I'm  especially fond of the way the script slowly unfolds our understanding,  rather than trying to lay it all out for us, and the look of the movie is  as close to genuine cyberpunk as anyone's yet come.  The DVD has lots of  extras, but a lot of them are empty fluff (&quot;Are You the One?&quot; --  now really!) and about half are accessible only on a computer with DVD  capability, not on your standard DVD player.  Still, you can't go wrong  with The Matrix if you like intelligent sf, moody action, or witty  paranoia.	4.0	A Chilling Vision	2000-08-15	2	1	1

Although there are aspects of this movies that I can certainly grasp as being quite as appealing to a teenaged kid as to me, I  am an adult and to prove it, here is a fact: I watched  &quot;Bladerunner&quot; the FIRST time it came out. &quot;The Matrix&quot;  has the same kind of sensibility.  What I am trying to say is that in both  cases the viewer must accept a complete vision of a world that has been  captured extremely stylishly by the directors. This has been sucessfully  done in both cases, in my opinion, and if you are a sci fi freak, or even  just a regular movie lover, make room for this unusally smoothly directed  and acted video in your library.  If you are female, Keanu Reeves will get  you through the few slow parts(even when he has the really  short hair),  and if you are male, you'd have to be nuts not to find Carrie-Anne Moss  appealing in her vinyl full body suit.  As a team, they are great when they  set off to rescue Laurence Fishburne.  No holds barred, a terrific scene.  Great pacing, high level of excitement.So buy it.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T	Jed Shlackman	This is an exceptional film, full of action, suspense, mystical philosophy and symbolism.  The story is set in a sci-fi future where AI machines have taken over the world and plugged biological humans into the Matrix, where they experience an illusory reality while their body serves as a battery/energy source for the machines.  &quot;Neo&quot; Anderson (&quot;One&quot; &quot;Son of Man&quot;), played smoothly by K. Reeves is contacted via hacking of the Matrix by a group of renegade humans who have been able to hide from the machines and escape enslavement while they prepare for the &quot;One&quot; expected to lead humanity to freedom.  Adventure ensues when Neo is unplugged and joins the freedom fighters.  This story is a wonderful allegory for human existence and civilization, and the film has excellent effects, solid acting, and an impressive script for a movie of this genre.  The DVD has cool bonus features and is a must for those seeking subtle symbolism and other nuances of the film.	5.0	Enjoy The Matrix... Until You Unplug...	2003-07-23	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A3CEK2IOEH0ORW	Jeff	"The Matrix works because it repackages themes from older movies, and, indeed, older literature and mythology, in a cutting edge, sci-fi cinematic wrapping. It's more than just a wrapping actually. In reworking the old ideas it adds nuances that may or may not have existed (or at least explicitly expressed) earlier.Cinematically, there's a strong thread going back to Kubrick's 2001. HAL 9000 (each letter of HAL is one away from IBM) turns on his human companions to murder them.A decade later, Darth Vader appeared on the screen, a lethal, murderous monster, ""more machine than man."" Again, the creation (machine) turns on creator. (At the same time, there are nice, even heroic machines: C3PO and R2-D2).In the next decade we were introduced to The Terminator. Governor Arnold (when he was just a mega-star, millionnaire plebian like the rest of us) comes from the future, where Machines have almost wiped out the human race, to kill the mother of the future leader. Once more, inhuman machine turned murderous against its creator.The Matrix takes this to a whole new level. The Machines have already won. There's just a few stragglers who have not succumbed. The new, ingenious twist is that they are controlled not so much by physical force but by mind: the Matrix software that feeds directly into the brain and leads humans to believe they live normal lives when ""in reality"" they sit in life support pods providing electrical power for the machines. It truly is the grand illusion.This theme goes back, cinematically, to classic silent film, Metropolis, as well (in a different way) to Frankenstein.Before the advent of movies -- indeed, before technology and the Industrial Revolution -- this idea was found in ancient lore and mythology. The Golem of Jewish lore or Beowulf, for instance.The bottom line of all these themes, though, is the internal struggle that goes on for each human being. The part of us that is human, feeling and has a heart vs. the part of us that is inhuman, unfeeling and cold-blooded. (Jurassic Park also explores the reemergence of cold-blooded human nature; not so much the dinosaurs and T-Rex, which nowadays is assumed was probably warm-blooded, but corporate greed that puts making money above human life.)In the end, these movies, and other expressions, persist in human culture, because the hero discovers his humanity, and, with it, an appreciation of his humanity.HAL 9000 is dismantled; David Bowman, a Messiah-figure (""David"") survives and is reborn.Darth Vader, starting with Episode V and climaxing in Episode VI, teaches us that even someone so far gone that he's ""more machine than man,"" can regain his humanity.Arnold returns in T-2 to be the good guy, the father figure, humanity's savior. He's really all of us who have struggled with our dark side, our unfeeling side, our addicted side (the addict turns monster in pursuit of his fix) -- our tendency toward inhumanity.The Matrix works for many reasons, and has many facets, but its main one, in my opinion, is this age-old theme. We are not machines. We are not strapped into our fate. We can change. We can escape. We can overcome addiction -- be it to alcohol, some illegal substance, nicotine, porn, greed, food, TV, etc. We can rediscover our humanity, even in a very insane, often inhumane world, whose technological influence is all-pervasive and -- almost -- All-Powerful."	5.0	HAL-Darth Vader-Terminator connection	2005-02-01	5	4	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A2KAVOGWK3BRB7	"Jeffrey A. Veyera ""Jeff Veyera"""	&quot;The Matrix,&quot; along with &quot;Blade,&quot; &quot;The Crow,&quot; and &quot;Batman,&quot; have proven that movies based on comic books need not be death at the box office.  The formula for success seems  to rely on the use of visual effects to create memorable (if unrealistic)  images much as explode off every page of a comic book.  To avoid  cheesiness, the comic book movie should move action along at a frightening  pace, not giving audiences time to poke holes in the plot.&quot;The  Matrix&quot; follows the formula to the letter and succeeds.  A  &quot;Terminator&quot; style plot concerning machines' subjugation of  humans and the quest for freedom on a virtual reality battleground aside,  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a pulse-pounding action movie with jaw-dropping  special effects.Laurence Fishburne is at his understated best as the  leader of the rebellion, while Keanu manages to look appropriately stylish  and not botch his lines (which means he's in top form here).  The rest of  the cast is essentially scenery and unworthy of comment here.In movies  of this sort, wherein an unrealistic world is created, it is important for  the plot to be subject to some hard and fast rules.  Whenever these do not  exist (as in the &quot;Phantom Menace,&quot; for example), one is left  unable to suspend disbelief and ride along with the film.  &quot;The  Matrix&quot; succeeds admirably as it switches between our world and the  virtual one known as the Matrix.While it certainly won't earn you any  points with the Starbucks-swilling set, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is great  fun.

The special effects although highly original and groundbreaking when the movie first came out now at times seem a little tired, perhaps part of the cause is Keneau Reeves and others in the cast are not really into martial arts in real life, so the close up fight scenes could never look really great.

0790745399	The Matrix	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	The Matrix is one of the most spectacular Sci Fi Movies of the 20th Century.  Not totally originally, but it combines elements of so many previous Sci Fi flicks that it's more like a tribute to those previous stories.  It may not be totally original, but the combination of aspects have never been more originally executed.  The use of the wires during fight scenes and the rotating angles (bullet speed as they call it) give the movie a visual sense of a created world, something that is not real and can be manipulated.  The movie takes place somewhere in the future, opening with a glimpse of the life of Neo (Reeves in a role he was most likely born to play), a computer programmer working for a large corporation who does hacker work in his off time.  After being discovered for his illegal extracurricular activity, Neo is intercepted by a mysterious woman, Trinity (the striking Carrie-Anne Moss) who claims to know what or actually who, he is looking for;  Morpheous, a charismatic mystery man played by Fishbourne, who gives a strong leader performance.  Morpheous believes Neo is the coming messiah who will save mankind, but from what?  That is where the question, `What is the Matrix?' comes in.  Explaining it takes a few different scenes and although it's a fairly simple concept, the motivations behind it all take a little more length in detail.  As the questions unfold, Neo starts to realize his destiny and the action escalates as the movie moves on.  The inclusion of high energy martial arts fighting scenes are so ingeniously integrated into the movie as well as other aspects of action, that you have to applaud the writers and directors.  With this concept, you could put almost anything into this story line.  To state anymore may ruin the plot but simply put, Matrix makes you wonder about your own world.  The disturbing questions it brings to the surface make you question the validity of your own existence, and that is where the most frightening aspects of The Matrix lie.  Part Science Fiction, part twilight zone, part action movie and part big-brother paranoia propaganda, The Matrix suggests that we should question everything around us and supplement our minds with things that are outside the realm of what we accept as everyday thinking.  Packed with extra features for the DVD player as well as the DVD ROM for your PC, this is definitely worth the money.

The script is great, the directing, cinematography, you name it. The only thing  I found a little off was the costume design. For a Matrix reality set in  the late 1990s, why were people wearing so much black vinyl/leather? That  was really my only complaint.  The &quot;follow the white rabbit&quot;  feature on the DVD is excellent, showing how all the special effects were  created. And even though I remain not-a-Keanu-Reeves-fan, I have to admit  that he did a very good job in this role, and this movie is a definite  winner.	5.0	I loved it, and I don't even like sci-fi.	2000-02-02	4	3	1

If you have seen the previews of this movie, you have already seen the over rated graphics. The  most impressive effects are done better in the Gap ads.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3UM5SBEU5LRCT	Jennifer Walker	This movie must be seen twice in order to be fully appreciated.  The first viewing should be spent enjoying it for its eye-popping special effects, for its outrageous action, for its killer industrial soundtrack, and for  the pleasure of watching Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss run around  looking fabulous.The second viewing should be spent contemplating the  questions The Matrix raises about our perception of reality.  It's hard to  believe that such a slick, glossy production starring Keanu Reeves conveys  such deep, mind-boggling concepts, but it does.The directing Wachowski  brothers (the guys responsible for the wonderfully outrageous Bound), have  been influenced heavily by other filmmakers, authors and artists, and they  don't try to hide it in the least.  However, rather than a blatant rip-off,  this plays more like a reverent homage.Laurence Fishburne projects a  powerful presence as the wise Morpheus, although it often seems that he  employed William Shatner as his dialogue coach.  Keanu Reeves is in his  element.  The Matrix maximizes his strengths (his ability to look  completely dumbfounded and his unique physicality) and minimizes his  weaknesses (just about everything else).  The role of Neo is tailor-made  for him.  The real standout in the cast, however, is Carrie-Anne Moss as  Trinity.  She is a real find, and while she is stunning in a shiny black  cat suit, her purpose in this film is not simply ornamental.  She is  responsible for at least half of this movie's excitement, and she gives it  its emotional heart.The Matrix is two movies in one.  One is a truly  awesome action movie, and the other is a deep meditation on the nature of  reality.  It can be enjoyed equally on both levels, but maybe not on first  viewing.  See it at least twice.Stay tuned after the credits for 4  behind-the-scenes vignettes, one of which shows Reeves, in full wicked-bad  regalia, perform a hilarious, unintentional pratfall.	5.0	See It Twice	2000-03-10	114	91	23

0790745399	The Matrix	A3ECAJWID28QQD	Jerry Tai	There are something I hate about this film. 1. The visual effects:  If anyone thinks that a good film is based on how stunning its visual and sound effects are? It's absolutely a wrong thing.  Federico Fellini,  Francis Coppola, and Peter Weir can show viewers great movies by catching  the expression that actors provide. 2. Keanu Reeves: Honestly, he did a way  better job in &quot;Speed&quot;. He looked like a freak more than a hero. I  don't blame him for the bad acting, but this film was definately not fit in  to him.  3. &quot;He is the one&quot;: Holy Cow!  Can any Hollywood  director stop doing this, if heroes do exist, we are out of misery. 4. The  Martial Art in this film couldn't excite me, because that was too ugly to  watch, they should all be trained for at least 8 months.And here is one  thing I like about this film: The Ideas.  The idea of that we are living in  the computer-controlled &quot;Matrix&quot; is a real cool idea and the  script writer made the dialogues clear about the technical terms the actors  were speeking.  Anyway I really can't give a higher admires more than that.	2.0	The Ideas Were Cool, But......	2000-01-18	2	0	2

True, there are some excellent special effects - realistic ones, but many are too false eg gunfight in hall with pillars when gunfire too easily splinters junks of concrete and  it falls like polystyrene - as it is.  The storyline is somewhat boring,  and I fell asleep during twice trying to view the whole film;  the third  occasion I managed to stay the course but only by fast-forwarding the  chunks of dialogue which apart from being boring were also too far-fetched  to be believable.  In all the film was much like the Curates egg - a mixed  bag - some good some bad.  I am in my 60s and have viewed many hundreds of  films and, generally, I agree the average viewing star-rating.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2U0ID3CNY8VSZ	J. Howard	With a title like &quot;The Matrix&quot;, and with an actor named Keanu Reeves, I was hoping that this movie was going to be a great vision of William Gibson's stories of Cyberspace, as the movie Johnny Mnemonic was.  I had to make myself go back to see this movie twice, just to make myself accept the fact that this movie was a letdown that didn't do justice to William Gibson's idea of &quot;the matrix&quot;.  The idea that alien cyberspace beings have to breed human beings in order to survive from their body heat, and keep them in a world of illusion called &quot;the matrix&quot;, is so far fetched that it makes it impossible to identify with the movie.  It is also a completely different conception of the matrix than the one Gibson envisions in his books such as &quot;Neuromancer&quot; - a matrix consisting of the world of the Internet and the battles of corporations fought in the world of cyberspace.  If anyone was hoping to see the vision of Gibson's &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, they still have to wait for a better movie.

The Matrix is one outstanding movie!You will be glued to your seat watching the movie unfold not wanting to miss anything.Its dynamic visual impact along with the intriguing possibility that the Matrix is a real part of our world  is a powerful combination.Keanu Reeves as Neo, Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus and Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity are all superb in their respective parts. Fascinating to watch. You will be drawn in as Neo is ushered into the world of the Matrix.What's real?

0790745399	The Matrix	A24O10WYHDT6AR	Joan Anne	This movie is nothing short of an allegory.  As I walked out of the theater I thought increduously, &quot;I wonder how many people realize how true this movie is?&quot;Not only does this movie deliver in terms of action, suspense, plot and soundtrack, it's here to teach us something.  Waking up is no fun, but choosing to sleep is worse.  Which will it be for you: the red pill or the blue pill?	5.0	It's more than a great movie	2002-12-19	3	1	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A1IU7S4HCK1XK0	Joanna Daneman	This has to be one of my top 10 favorite films. The plot is unique; a world where virtual reality is more real and more dangerous than actual reality and where the borders between them are tenuous at best. The shock scenes that reveal the truth are so well done, I can't begin to describe them. You just have to experience it.The special effects in this film changed forever how such effects are done in film. The actors move in ways you can't imagine. The Kung-fu scenes are so good, I watch them again and again. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Ann Moss give phenomenal performances in the Matrix. The entire film is done with such incredible quality of effects, direction and acting, that it's no wonder this was an immediate cult classic. The score is great, too.It's worth having the widescreen edition to appreciate the cinematography, and DVD for the surround sound, as the score is so good.	5.0	BREATHTAKING!

0790745399	The Matrix	A1X2T16VEGVUNA	"Joecooler2u ""Joe"""	"If you haven't seen The Matrix yet, what world are you living in? This movie is awesome! The computer usage is dated (as are the cell phones) which is a common thing in films relying on technology, but the story, action and special effects hold up very well. Blu Ray is just an amazing format. If you don't have it, what are you waiting for? You can get a good player for a little over $100 (I paid $140 for mine which is a Sony S560, hope I got that right) but the quality is amazing.With The Matrix you get a great version, almost an ultimate version with this 10th Anniversary. You won't need to buy another version unless if you are a hard-core fan. The extras are spectacular, though a little hard to access. I had problems getting to the main menu, it kept wanting to go to the movie, so there is my only complaint. As for the extras, there are so many features, 4 Commentaries, a feature-length documentary )The Matrix Revisited), Behind The Matrix Documentary Gallery (7 Featurettes!), Take The Red Pill Documentary Gallery (2 Featurettes), Follow The White Rabbit Documentary Gallery (9 Featurettes)The Music Revisited - 41 track audio selection with nearly 3 hours of music, Marilyn Manson Music Video, Theatrical Trailer & TV Spots.All this and I haven't mentioned the Digi-book and the movie itself (quality-wise). There is some controversy about the Digi-book among geeks. Their complaint is that the book makes the Blu Ray package bigger than the standard Blu Ray size. It's a valid complaint. For those of you who don't know, standard Blu Ray boxes are about an inch smaller than standard DVD boxes, so the Digi-book edition here is about the size of a standard DVD. It sticks out in your Blu Ray storage (Book Shelf or whatever you use to store your Blu Rays). Now that being said, I think it's a bit making a mountain out of a molehill. Yes, it's a minor inconvienence but not worth all the complaint I have read about it.As for the movie itself, The Matrix has never looked better than this. Never sounded better either. Some scenes to watch for is when they ""rescue"" Neo the vibrant colors really stand out. I have noticed that Lightning/electricity comes off really good on Blu Ray. In the original Terminator, the electric crackles in your speakers and seems to pop off your screen. In T2 & T3 the lightning effect is more realistic and thinner. It just looks and sounds so real and great, it's hard to describe. The same happens when Neo is disconnected before being flushed, when he looks around for the first time and sees the ""real world"" it is visually breath-taking.So how do I feel about The Matrix 10th Anniversary Edition Blu Ray? It gets top notch recommendation. If you like Sci-fi, action, special effects, mystery or movies that make you think and gasp in awe of what you see, then this is a must-buy for you!"	5.0	Matrix + Blu Ray + Bullet Time = Awesome!	2010-04-20	2	1	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A2AKTLHH3MWDNJ	joe	Unlike other action/sci fi movies that have begun to tear apart the same plots and visuals over and over again, The Matrix's plot makes you think harder than any movie of the past twenty years, no disrespect to Spielberg,  Lucas or Cameron. It strikes a one-of-a-kind thought chord in your head.  And as for solid action and visuals, well, in my opinion, the last two  movies to push digital technology to the edge were 1991's Terminator 2:  Judgement Day and of course, 1999's The Phantom Menace.  The Matrix just  shot itself up past both of them and the only movie that I think will outdo  it will The Matrix 2	5.0	The Matrix: Whoa!	1999-12-18	0	0	0

""are we in the matrix?""  ""no.""  ""now we're in the matrix"" ""oh, i though we were not in the matrix"" ""no, we are, and we all wear crumby clothes.""

(though, i mean, it was cool to have him come out a thousand times, but we could get a few different options for enemies, couldn't we?  did he get an acadamy award for portraying the same character  a lot in one movie?  because i think it would get old if i were him)  what cracks me up is that everyone i talked to thought it needed more story!  no!  thats what ruined the first one!  oh!  and it totatlly ruined the third one!  (here's how bad.  i was on a plane for like, another 12 hours.  i just stopped watching it and stared at the wall.  its so boring!  well, the kung fu fight was rad.)the matrix had some pretty amazing and original ideas, and it was groundbreaking, but its just so over rated i couldn't help myself but to write this!  and of course, i already checked, about 2,304 plus peope disagree, but that's my point.ok, ok, you disagree completely, you can have your opinion, i can have mine, but here, can we agree on this?  whichever movie where they all had that freaky chemimcal brothers rave in a cave and bumped and ground and made out and were trying to look all sexy with these metal dots all over them and were all rubbing the dots and going all crazy, that was pretty weird.  you've got to at least admit that."	3.0	i'll give 3 stars for creatively killing the same guy a lot	2004-10-17	8	2	6

The software is intense too. The production release I own, makes my early model  DVD fail (freeze or lock up) in three different scenes. This material is  notorious as an MPEG buster. If your DVD player can't play this movie end  to end without stoping, then it might be time for a software (or hardware)  upgade for that clunky old DVD player. The fight scenes aren't the only  thing that can deliver a death blow. My wife always wanted to see what  Keanu Reeves would look like clean shaven and dipped in goo.

0790745399	The Matrix	AVLJGDXO0ZZKI	joe smo	"The Matrix, a film which stunned the world when it was released back in late March of 1999 is still a great film whichis certainly one of my favorite films of all time.  I remember how dazzled I was after viewing this film at the cinema, mainly due to the superb visual effects and well I didn't exactly get the plot that well, but I also was only like 10 years old.I purchased it on DVD in March of 2001 and it has since been a treasure to behold and I'm very proud that it is a part of my DVD collection.The tale begins with a man named Neo (Keanu Reeves) who is contacted by an individual named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and is told that he is ""the One.""  He is supposedly the savior of mankind, because the Agents (one of which is played excellently by Hugo Weaving) are trying to elimiate of the city Zion, which is the last human city.  The story is much more intricate than that, and may need a few viewings to fully grasp.  Overall, this is a visually stunning film and really revolutionized the way action would be done in the future, but I still don't think I would call it the best action movie ever made.  The majority of the action is infact in the last 30 minutes of the movie, and this is a 136 minute film.  But the action is definetly amazing to see, the ""bullet-time"" effect is very unique and original and is surely been one of the most copied off visual effects in recent memory, (ie, Charlie's Angels), though that was still an entertaining movie.The Wachowski Brothers stunned the world with ""The Matrix,"" and soon made two sequels which were delayed due to the unfortunate losses of Aaliyah and Gloria Foster.  ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" were released in 2003 and made quite a bit of money at the box-office.  I actually appreciated the sequels and enjoyed them, and I feel they are just as much worth owning as the first film itself.  Many peopleplaced too much hype on the sequels and so that's why they've received a mixed critical reaction.  I loved them and thought that visually they were even more spectacular.Overall, ""The Matrix"" is a one of a kind picture, with a thought-provoking storyline and script, nice performances (even from Reeves, who isn't as bad an actor as many think he is).  Carrie-Anne Moss proved to be a great female action star.The Matrix is rated R for Sci-fi Violence and Brief Language andI felt that this film could've easily earned a ""PG-13"" rating.  The film features a lot of gunplay (some of which is bloodless),martial arts fights (which are still pretty cool, though there have been films with better fight sequences than the ""TheMatrix"", ie: the sequels) and some mild profanity, none of which is particularly strong.If you've been living under a rock for the last 6 years and haven't seen this film, definetly see it because it's well worth checking out."	4.0	The Matrix- A Dazzling Cinematic Experience	2005-03-27	0	0	0

The movie makes you wonder about what's real with your own life. It is kind of easy to be critical of Keanu Reeves' acting ability, he does alright in this. If you have seen this and not seen The Matrix Reloaded or Revolutions, then just stop now.

The ship is his body, Morpheus is his common sense, Trinity is his love and he got one corrupted guy in him who is called Cypher and he wants to give up and stop struggling. The one who's looking into the matrix is his conscious and he has a hard time to see what's going on in this world because it's so much information in this world who hypnotizes the human mind. Most of the people is not unplugged, with other words hypnotized, and he is struggling very hard(against Agent Smith, his speech is slow - and has an hypnotic effect - to not fall into hypnotic stage, suggestions, manipulation, projections etc.)And then we got the Oracle (subconscious) who knows everything about him of course, she shows him the way where he has all the old agreements in his life to understand a certain (western) reality.He just wants to free his mind, where he is a prisoner and has boundaries into time, agreements, opinions and properties.	5.0	The best film ever	2003-09-14	0	0	0

Perhaps the best effect in the movie is how they managed to mask all of Reeves' poor acting...he  actually is bearable in this film!  The story line is straightforward, and  is blisfully absent of the 42 plot twists that most movies these days seem  to feel are necessary.  The only complaint I have about the movie is the  over-the-top violence.  I am not squeamish by any means, but a couple of  sceenes in the movie left me wondering, 'WHY?'  The DVD has the added  'follow the white rabbit' feature which allows you to see how a certain  effect was done while in the movie.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3A48XEYWLWH7T	John IV	When I first saw the Matrix in the theatres I was immediately taken with the central proposition which looked oddly like one of the options in Descartes' Discourse on Method.  What if, and how would we know, we are indeed in a sleep/dream world, manipulated by an external controlling force?  How would we know if we were awake or still asleep?  Neo sleeps and his brain hints at this possibility.  Slowly he is tracked by those from the true world, while agents of the external controlling force also monitor him in an effort to capture the others.  Neo is eventually awakened into the `real world' and the Matrix takes off on it's epic ride of slow motion Kung Fu mayhem and beautifully choreographed gunfights.  This combination of cerebral back story and excessive destruction made this movie a hit across all strata of viewing demographics.  Everytime I watch it now on DVD there is some new bit to marvel at, either in subtle movements of foreshadowing, the amazing fight scenes, or even the pace and placement of music.  I enjoyed it then, and now, it's highly recommended.  I also enjoyed the sequel but will get to that when it's released on DVD in a few weeks, and like many others I look forward to the completion of the trilogy in a month.	5.0	Marvelous: Descartes&#65533; Action Thriller	2003-10-12	1	0	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW	John K. Reed	than anything else.  The underlying premise being that we can ultimately be in control of our own lives and destiny if we will just get past all of the b.s. that society and particularly the government put upon us.  If you'll notice there are multiple refernces to the inherent evil of the tax system (IRS) and the accepted standards of career development and obeying you 'superiors' rather than following your own inner voice.  But what I particularly enjoyed is when Morpheus states that most people are not ready (and I would add that they're ill equipped) to think for themselves and not be a slave to the system or the false nature of the society in which we live.  And as such, the vast majority of society is the enemy of those who really know the truth.  Our entire educational system (the perfect example) is set up to prepare people not to be individuals but rather automatons answering the bell and following the herd while making wealthy, fulfilled, and happy people out of the few who can see beyound the smoke screen.There's also a very spiritual undercurrent to the film.  To me the film makes the case that within us all there is a power that is far greater than we could ever imagine.  We just have to learn to tap into it (believe) and become our true actualized selves.  As Morpheus states there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.  But very few of us will ever even know the path let alone even endeavor to walk the path.  But it is there within all of us to know and walk.  As Neo says the choice is up to you.The most powerful and important idea expressed though is that whatever your mind believes is ultimately reality.  Also the concept that the data your mind is fed in either a conscious or unconscious state will be accepted and believed holds tremendous promise for more enlightened and truly powerful individuals.  That is if you're willing to let go of all the crap you've been spoon fed all of your life and willing to begin to feed yourself that which truly nourishes your mind.The story is awesome, the special effects are beyond belief, the action is fantastic and the premise is not as sci-fi or far fetched as may be commonly believed.	5.0	The philosophy is what makes this a classic film more ....	2001-03-02	7	5	2

When a group of rebels such as Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie Ann-Ross), Cyprus (Joe Pantoliano), Tank (Marcus Chong), Mouse (Matt Doran), Switch (Belinda McClory) and more come to Neo's rescue they open his eyes to reality that what his own perception is reality isn't what it really is. It's a world controlled by A.I. as long ago machines took over nearly the planet and the only place for humanity is underground in a large city called Zion where Neo is foretold in a prophecy by the Oracle (Gloria Foster) that he is a future messiah to destroy those that have control of the system called The Matrix.One of the greatest Sci-fi and action movies of all time! The Wachowskis after doing ""Bound"" and ""Assassins"" wrote/produced/directed a genuine new classic of the genres. While the film maybe not very original as it borrows from Frank Herbert's Dune novels, anime (Ghost in The Shell for example), comic books, William Gibson's cyberpunk novels, Blade Runner, John Woo's movies, martial arts cinema and more in one unique and smart ride of a movie. In March of 1999, audiences made this one of the highest grossing movies of the sci-fi genre as both critics/audiences embraced this movie including me. As a fan of animation/anime/Sci-fi/action/cyberpunk at the age of 17 watching this in theaters 7 times it got better with each viewing, the performances are terrific including Keanu Reeves at times even if he's a bit on the wooden side. Some of the dialog is a bit silly but there's good philosophy with outstanding unforgettable sequences that echo anime and John Woo's Hong Kong motion pictures. It was followed by 2 sequels which are enjoyable but nothing beats the first one, it's still popular to this day and now imitated but never equaled.I own this in the Matrix Trilogy boxset but this Blu-Rays shows flawless picture despite a few grains in a couple of scenes, outstanding sound that rockets the sound system to high rolling. The extras are terrific as In-Movie Experience which as you watch the movie you see a small full film length experience of recollections of the cast and crew, written introduction, 4 audio commentaries, Full length documentary: ""The Matrix Revisited"", featurettes of many, The Music revisited where 41-track audio music selection where you hear the score with some of the songs for 3 hours, music video with Marylin Manson and finally TV Spots with Trailers/Teasers."	5.0	A 90's Sci-fi classic that looks terrific on Blu-Ray!	2003-04-15	0	0	0

What I might be able to add is that it is not an easy film to understand,  I suggest that before viewing it you read a number of reviews and undertake some analysis of the ideas it presents.

It's artificial. We are really in some tube somewhere, being used by machines as energy sources. You see that computer screen in front of you? It's not real.While this movie is rated R, I don't think it should be. PG-13, yes, but R?! For action violence? Really.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1M566ZCEEA877	Johnny Lee	"I found this film to be an incredibly well integrated look at the philosophy of modern man. A great deal of the foundational plot twists follow the concept of _Atlas_Shrugged_, and the story's action is first-rate without being gratuitous.The story follows Thomas Anderson (a.k.a., Neo) as he pursues an answer to the nagging suspicion that something is fundamentally wrong with the world. Like Galt's men of ability, Neo is chosen for his talents and unwillingness to flinch in the face of adversity.He is enslaved by the very talents that make him who he is, and his motive power is being used to sustain a world that is, at base, a fantasy. Just as with _Atlas_Shrugged_, a single man identifies the truth, assembles a team of those capable of identifying the truth, and they continue to recruit and fight until they can stop the motor of a corrupt world.The parallels are comfortably ensconced throughout the movie, and one gains the impression that the writing here was designed for numerous levels of comprehension and enjoyment. In its own right, ""The Matrix"" is a top-notch action film, but it is also a paean to individualism and philosophical freedom: ""...as long as the Matrix exisits, man cannot ever truly be free.""A key and aptly named player, Morpheus, tells Neo that everyone in the world is so ""hopelessly inured"" in the matrix that they are not ready to be freed; consequently, they will fight to protect their system--meaning that, until their liberation, they remain enemies to the cause of liberation.Even those characters that seem a little contrived can be considered as rational players in the overall plot. For instance, there is an Oracle that each of the rebels goes to visit for insight. The Oracle is less of a visionary that a resource than a source of inspiration, for she tells her callers only what they need to here in order to be successful. In all, this was a first-rate film with a trememdously solid cast and truly enjoyable writing."	5.0	Objective reality discovered and the fight to maintain it!	2002-02-03	9	5	4

But to hell with that, it's still a very, very fun ride, and I'll watch it  many times. As to technical problems; it appears that the problems are with  the players.  This disc is one of the few to exercise this many features in  the DVD standard, and some players (particularly older ones) can't handle  it.  My advise?  Buy this disc and see if your player can handle it, and if  it can't, get the maker to fix it; this would be a &quot;quality of  workmanship&quot; error, since the disc DOES MEET THE DVD SPEC.

You know, the one with Neo, Trinity, the Agents and a decimated earth of the future controlled by robots. Are they both the same movies? They are? Wow, what a let down. Don't get me wrong, I really like the idea behind this movie and the CGI was nothing sort of amazing. Even the acting was sort of good. That's not what I had a problem with. The problem is in the details.The first problem I had was that all the con-fu hand to hand fighting was really, REALLY, fake. It's down right laughable at the end when Neo is fighting agent Smith in the hallway. It was just one of the dumbest things I had ever seen.Another problem I had was that the movie was just too short. I mean one minute Neo is freaking out about being pulled out of the Matrix, the next he's dodging bullets and killing whole swat teams. The movie would have been much better if it had just been a little lounger.My last complaint is a miner one but one I feel almost ruined the movie for me. I thought that the real world was going to have nothing to do with earth or what is in the Matrix, so I was very disappointed to find out the ""real world"" was really earth in the future. It would have been much better if, instead of taking shortcuts, the directors of this film would have actually created a completely different would with different laws of nature and everything.I will not deny that this is a good movie, but it is not in any way a masterpiece or worth spending $20 on. Take my advice and rent this movie before even thinking about buying it."	3.0	overated	2006-03-22	9	2	7

The fight  scenes rival those of even John Woo films such as The Killer and Hard  Boiled.  The actors were all excellent, even Keanu Reeves, who gives a  minimalist, yet realistic performance.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1KCQ1ZCSCP1KN	Jonathan Coish	The Matrix... you all have at least heard of the movie, and you all know that it is known for the special effects... and the special effects are AWESOME!!!! But this movie has depth... I originally watched this film in theatres, and I was blown away by the special effects, but that was about it... the story was cool, but nothing spectacular... anyways, I watched it again tonight (well half of it anyways), and my God, this movie is totally awesome... it's more then awesome special effects, it's an awesome movie all around, one of the best sci-fi movies ever, no question... The story is very ingenious, and philosophical... I wonder how many people have actually wondered if this world was nothing more then a computer program fed to our brains, I know I have... and before the movie came out I might add... I won't get into the details of the story, cause you'll just have to see it... but the way the effects, music, and everything about the movie comes together is awesome... it all fits together perfectly... the action scenes are obviously designed to appeal to those you might not totally grasp the concept and message of the story line, but if you can appreciate the plot with the effects and action scenes, and everything else that is here, it'll just blow your mind... I turned off the tv (the movie was shown on television) and was totally blown away tonight... this is an inteligent movie, and is more then a bunch of innovative effects... if you liked the movie for the effects, and didn't really go too deep in the plot, well watch it again, and take in everything... it's an awesome movie, and one of the best ever in my opinion... oh, and another thing, I've never really been a fan of Keanu Reeves acting, but even he turns in a good performance (the others are stellar as well)... definately check this out... deserves more then 5 stars...oh, and another thing, it's totally based around computers and that stuff, so you definately need to have some knowledge or interest in that stuff to really enjoy this movie... but still, you need to see this movie!!!! well, I've said too much... later...	5.0	My God, what a ... great movie!!!	2001-10-19	2	0	2

0790745399	The Matrix	AWHLCGP5WW5AU	Jordyn	Matrix is a wonderfully built movie that makes the audience think and expand their thoughts on normal everyday life. It delivers a fine performance with Keanu Reeves as the star Neo, who may be humanity's last hope. The film has suspense, action, special effects beyond anything you've ever seen before, and even humor. The plot twists and turns, but the viewer is able to catch up if they get lost.Such a creative film is a very impressive piece of cinematography. Never has the audience seen such an array of mind blowing special effects and such an intriguing plot.The Matrix movie is about the world as we think we know it...but in fact we are all, all of us humans, being used as slaves for the machines that have taken over our world. Neo is trying to figure this out, and then he is told the truth. The world we think we are living in, is actually a wreck. We are living in a sort of dreamworld.The movie is complex. It has bizarre ideas on things we wonder about everyday: even deja vu.The Matrix is a compelling, wonderful movie that you will enjoy as well as think about for days after. It is rated R for a lot of violence, but teens should be allowed to see it. Enjoy!	5.0	Impressive and intriguing	2003-09-21	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A1B8HI3VREI1H3	Jorge A. Zarco	"The Matrix(1999) was a big critical and commercial hit at the time. It was ""revolutionary""! Keanu Reeves played Mr. Anderson/Neo. He's a white collar office worker who finds out that reality is a computer program created by robots who have taken over the world. A group of rebels help him fight back. The Matrix is a ""cyberpunk"" classic. It mixes Total Recall, Hong Kong movies, anime, Alice in Wonderland, Darkman and philosophy in a blender. The Matrix was one of the first films to use ""bullet time"" photography. The film mixes hard rock with Don Davis' music score. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving took martial arts lessons before filming began. Yuen Woo Ping(Drunken Master) staged the kung fu fights for the film. There's also loud, energetic action scenes and gunplay. The Matrix has been spoofed in over 20 movies.Times have changed. The directors went on to make The Matrix sequels, Speed Racer(2008), and Cloud Atlas(2013). The Matrix deserves a place in your home video collection."	5.0	The Matrix(1999)	2013-02-09	2	2	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A1X3GV86BJDA6F	Jorune2112	We all know how good the Matrix is. What we need to center on here is what The Matrix DVD is. If anyone wonders why they should get a DVD player, this is the one to show them. Besides a crisp picture and great sounds, The  Matrix DVD comes with one of the most comprehensive DVD extra's I have ever  seen. Besides the commentaries, we have a few behind the scene  documentaries. We have mini-games to play (I love the addictiveness of the  little shoot-ep-up. It's like a level from an old arcade game).But the best  is the Follow the White Rabbit feature. You play the movie through this  option and whenever you see the white rabbit pop on screen, you press your  menu button where you are whisked away to a behind the scenes featurette  where they show you how they did the scene. When it ends you are plopped  right back into the movie from where you left off. Great for a soecial  effects mobie like this where you scratch your head and say &quot;How'd  they do that?&quot; There is no magician's secrets here, they are all too  happy to show you.

0790745399	The Matrix	A75MSQQ3LN86Z	Josef Bush	"It's 1999.  The worls is about to experience an event that will in many ways, determine the parameters of popular art within the realm of the most popular and influential of the popular arts, the world of Commercial Film.  With THE MATRIX the Wachowski brothers create and present a perfect example of what the Sci-Fi Adventure film of the hypothetical future would be in the actual future.  THE MATRIX, though perfectly self-contained, and received with enthusiasm by the public, would demand a sequel.  The Wachowskis would quickly provide two of them, and these subsequent films would amaze audiences by not only fulfilling the plot and motivatIon factors of the original story, but by becoming in unforseen ways, movies deeper, more profound and intellectually demanding; in other words, superior to the template from which they sprang.It all begins with the pulsing of a cursor light on an unattended computer monitor screen.Question:  What if you woke one day to find and to follow a sequence of remarkale evnts that led to the realizaion that the world around you, including all your most intimate associations, those given to you by your senses, was merely an illusion, a construct desined to control you, subliminally, for the beneift of un-alive, half-beings fundamenally unlike yourelf?  What would you do?  What could you do?  What if all this were ""a world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.""  What then?(1)  Would you quit your Programmer job?(2)  Would you Join a band of cyber-space rebels?  What if you were invited into it by someone irresistably attractive?(3)  What if the doping, pleasure-driven Web rebels knew you only  by your Net pseudonym, and accepted  you totally for what you only partly believed yourself to be?  Could you accept them?(4)  What if the leader of the Web rebels believed in you and your destiny, devoutly, and showed you that he'd been for most of his life dedicated to your appearance, and what if he were able to show you both your orignis and your destiny?  Would you believe and follow him?(5)  And what if this man, this dangerous outlaw,  believed you were the savior of ""the world"" or, of Humanity?(6)  And what if he were able to show you in a convincing way, what reality was, and how you were trapped in the lie of it?(7) And what if he were to introduce you to a clairvoyant who, though socially inappropriate, read the future?  Would you accept her message?(8)  Would you, as one of the fugitive band of time-travellers beyond the Matrix, join in a battle with the mechanized forces of the Matrix itself?  Would you confront it's terrifying and powerful agents?  At he risk of your life?(9)  Braving discomfort, bad food, and sensual deprivation, would you risk your identity and your ideal self to battle against the authoritarian agents of the Matrix?(10)  And would you risk everything for someone who believed in you absoluely, and loved you beyond anything you'd peviously imagined?(11)  And betrayal?  It is inevitable.  Will you be able to face it and survive?Phrophecy is funny:  People only talk about it, when they talk about it, to show they don't believe in it.  Mark of a decadent age.  A lack of moral imagination is the hallmark of decay.  Weep, my friends.  But, a voice speaks through the modem.  It says, ""I know you are out there.  I can feel you now.  I know that  you're afraid.  You're afrid of us; afraid of change.  I don't know the future.  I didn't come here to tell you how this will end.  I came here to tell you how this is going to begin.

0790745399	The Matrix	AHQYCRL2FMG3D	Joseph Valentine Dworak	The Matrix, a film masterpiece for the 21st century.  There are many reasons to own, watch, or rent the Matrix, and I will give you a few of the most important.1)  The special effects &amp; sound are like no other movie to date.  This movie blew me away.  I had the privelege of viewing this movie on a very large screen with digital sound in Washington, D.C.  The small screen does not really do this movie justice, but it can suffice if need be.  The sound is so crisp, and when the scenes go in slow-motion, it is like nothing you have ever seen before.2)  Keanu is actually tolerable.  Reeves does a good job of being the main character, Neo, and it seems like the role was written for him.  He shines with the interplay between him and Larry Fishburn, and with the Special Agents who are trying to destroy him.3)  The themes!  Is this our future?  Will computers rule the world?  Have we lost our soul?  What is real?  Will you swallow a blue or a red pill?  All issues you will be drawn into and have to digest as your view the Matrix.Those are just a few, but all important reasons to see this generations new anthem of malaise and questioning.  The matrix is a movie, you just have to see.	5.0	Re:Gen X	2002-08-06	1	1	0

This film grabs you.. and drags you unapologetically through a futuristic world of an alternate reality, leaving you winded, bruised and thinking in the process.  It is a fast-paced, slick barrage of visuals that seemingly jumped from the pages of Heavy Metal and were put to a great soundtrack.  Stunning special effects that were developed for the film immediately started showing up in other films and television shows, including Superbowl coverage.  The Wachowski Brothers struck a perfect balance between thought- provoking ""What If's"" and heart-pounding action sequences.  Matrix has a tight script that requires 2 or 3 viewings to catch all the nuances.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1L9VZG6VKBTJ9	Josh Martin	I have never been so intrigued by a video, the Matrix is where it's at for today in the movie industry.  I have never been able to watch a video more than twice due to excrutiating boredom,  but i have sat through the matrix 10+ times and find something new everytime.  Not only does the movie have killer fighting scenes, but it's ability to make you look deeper and actually have to think helps make this the movie of the century.  The movie line was believeable, and though it may appear corny at first, after watching several times paying close attention to the action, you'll notice it is superbly done(take for axample Neo in the helicopter rescuing his mentor).  It's almost as if the brothers who wrote this made the video, watched it over and over again finding each little detail that may have appeared unbelievale or corny and fixed it, and then watched it again just to make sure.  In this rather serious and deep movie they add just enough comic relief,  while still maintening(and not detracting from) the theme and story line.  The foreshadowing was excellently done,  partly due to it's subtlety.  It's metehpors and symoblism to the bible was also a nice touch.  I enjoyed the casting, because due to the fact that the cast wasn't very well known so it wasn't easy to confuse the actors roles in this movie with those of past works.  Over all this is the best movie, bar none, that I have ever seen. I cannot wait for the sequals which are in the works as you are reading this.	5.0	finally	2001-02-20	1	0	1

At the same time, it is something that is fun to watch (especially the lobby scene- WHOA!)  After watching it, one of  my friends and I came up with an appropriate slogan for its theme, a  take-off of the original &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;: Cogito  cogito, ergo cogito sum.

0790745399	The Matrix	A125U7I9B2XF4O	Josiah Jenkins	"The Matrix = The BibleExtraordinary special effects make the this 1999 film well known.  As the modern Lamborghini is to the Model T, so The Matrix is to movies of the past.  The Matrix is also well known for its complex plot.  In order to understand this movie, the average person must watch it twice.  Because of its complexly intriguing plot and outstanding special effects, the allusions or parallels can go unnoticed by the common person.  The Bible and the 1999 film The Matrix have incredible parallels.  The most recognizable parallels linking the Bible and the film together are the names. There are names given to people, a place, and a ship that make Biblical names.  The name of the ship the humans live on is called the Nebuchadnezzar.  This is no coincidence that Nebuchadnezzar was the name of the ship (it is not like it is a frequently used name these days).  This is the name of a king written about in the Bible.  The awkwardness of the name of this ship is the fact that king Nebuchadnezzar was an evil king in the Bible, when in the film Nebuchadnezzar is the name of the humans' ship and they are the ""good guys.""  The name of the last human city in the film is called Zion, while Zion is also a Biblical city.  In this parallel, the author uses a holy city from the Bible to allude to the ""good guys'"" city in the film, as the Bible refers to the final city as well being Zion.  The most frequently alluded to names are the names of a few of the key characters in the film.  The most obvious parallel is the one of the key  ""good guy"" characters is named Trinity.  Those who consider themselves Christians would/should know that the Bible refers to The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as one called the Trinity.  In the film, two characters seem to constantly parallel two characters in the Bible.  The more noticeable character that parallels someone in the Bible is Neo.  Neo clearly parallels Jesus.  Neo is constantly called ""the chosen one,"" and is called, at least once, ""The Savior"" (not counting the party guy who came to him before he came out of the Matrix).  Throughout the entire film, Neo seems like the Jesus in his world.  He is the only one who can save the world, just like Jesus was the only one who could save the world in the Bible.  Towards the end of the film, Neo does things that no other human could ever do, in other words, miracles.  The word ""miracle"" sounds awfully familiar when one is on the subject of the Bible.  Jesus performed many miracles in the Bible, just as Neo does in the film.  Another very interesting incident in the film was when Neo, ""the Savior,"" comes back to life.  This is no coincidence!  Jesus did the exact same thing in the Bible.  Both Jesus and Neo died and came back to life to save the world from the enemy.  John the Baptist was the primary forerunner to Jesus in the Bible.  Many of Morphias's actions seem to allude to John the Baptist's role in the Bible.  In the film, Morphias says to Neo that he had spent his life looking for the ""chosen one.""  In the same way, in the Bible, John the Baptist spent his entire life looking to find the chosen one, who was Jesus.  Morphias also stated that Neo was ""unplugged"" (taken out of the Matrix) to save the world.  Morphias even stated this before Neo was unplugged, just like a prophet would in the Bible.  While John the Baptist did not do anything to set Jesus free, he still preached (like Morphias did) that Jesus was the Savior that came to save the world.  A more hidden parallel in The Matrix is the incident in which the Centium Programmers (the bad guys) catch Neo.  The Centium Programmers offered to let Neo go if he agreed to work for them, and not for the good side.  This particular scene parallels an incident in the Bible when Jesus was tempted by the devil and told that if He would bow down to the devil, He could have everything in the world.  The devil wanted Jesus to work for him, just as did the Centium Programmers want Neo to work for them."	5.0	Bible (part one)	2000-12-14	11	4	7
0790745399	The Matrix	A3C80EHUU77WGH	jpiercy@linex.com	I watched this film twice and loved it! It was thought-provoking, tantalizing, invigorating and exciting. The Matrix requires the viewer to actually THINK and its story is deliciously deep and twisting, its concept  both frightening and infuriating.I don't like films that depend on  special effects. I also don't like films that advertise them and execute  them poorly. The Matrix used special effects about as well as I have ever  seen in any film. Not overdone, and when used, executed to absolute  perfection. The use of slow-motion combined with comic-book style action  was the beyond anything I have ever seen--simply mind-blowing!As for  nuts and bolts, this film used clever angles and interesting perspectives,  focusing in on otherwise mundane situations (falling bullets for instance)  to suddenly make them thrilling. The sound effects and music were perfect,  not blowing out your eardrums, enhancing--not taking away from--the pace of  the story, and adding to the overall enjoyment of the film.The cast was  excellent. Nobody was overblown, nobody &quot;stole&quot; the show to take  attention away from the others; the film took time to let us get to know  the characters, both the good and bad.As you can see, I loved this film.  I would not give it a four star rating because it did have some flaws that  I felt hurt the story, although I happily forgave the few problems that I  immediately noticed. However, I cannot be overly critical of a film that  did such an otherwise astounding job from start to finish--but naturally, I  wish it had been perfect!	4.0	AWESOME!

0790745399	The Matrix	A3PIZ7ME5FJBE2	J. Racasa	This was probably the best movie of 1999.  It's whole look and feel was so amazing.  By combining Hong Kong style martial arts action and a Hollywood budget, the Wachowski brothers delivered an awesome movie.  I've always  thought that Hong Kong movies needed that Hollywood touch and that a lot of  Hollywood action movies needed that Hong Kong style, well, it's happened  with the Matrix.  I'm not bothered by Keanu like a lot of people, I thought  he was great as Neo and seeing him and Fishburne actually do martial arts  was just awesome.  I thought they were going to substitute other people for  those scenes but it was actually those actors.  I feel sorry for the people  who didn't like this film, for those of us who did, man, we were treated to  an awesome movie that made us go &quot;Daaaaaam, did you see that! &quot;.  And with Jet Li set to join up for the sequels, things are looking up.  So  all you who didn't like matrix, just get lost and don't bother us  fans.	5.0	Best is yet to come	2000-07-12	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A2NBOL825B93OM	J R Zullo	"I bought ""The Matrix"" in DVD format yesterday. I bought it because this movie is one of the most recent and truest milestones in the story of cinema. And it's funny, because when the movie was released, back in 1999, it was not an instant success. I remember thinking (at the time): ""The world-dominated-by-machines plot, and starring Keanu Reeves - I will not waste my money and my time"". Now I regret not having watched it in the theatre.The plot is not original. It has been used in many science fiction movies, books, comics and so on. The machines have revolted against the humans, and we are nothing but slaves to them. ""The Terminator"" series comes to mind. But this time the treatment given to the story is different. ""The Matrix"" is an organic, mind blowing science fiction. There are lots of fluids, limbs, lack of hair, the design of the machines is also very organic, and the viewers can relate to that in a positive way. Also, the mistery provided by the first scenes - ""What is the Matrix?"" - tingles in our minds.This movie concentrates heavily on its characters. Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, Cypher, Switch, Apoc, Tank, Dozer, Mouse and, last but not least, Agent Smith, all of them have their own personalities, singularities, and maneirisms, presented along the duration of the movie - two hours that go by very fast. And each character (except for Neo) is played by a relatively unknown actor, or an actor that were at a low point in their careers at the time. Today, it's impossible to not know who Carrie-Ann Moss, Lawrence Fishburn or Hugo Weaving are.But ""The Matrix"" is an excellent movie because of all its elements. Acting is good. Action scenes are fantastic. The soundscore is unforgettable. The soundtrack is quite appropriate (energic, full of fury - there could be no better choice than RATM). The script is ballanced - fast-paced scenes mixed in with slow, explanation dialogues and even one or two love scenes in the middle. And, finally, the direction.I don't know if the ""freezing time"" technology was invented by the Wachowski brothers, and I couldn't care less about it. What I do know is that they mastered it in ""The Matrix"". The first time I watched this movie I was extremely impressed with those ""frozen"" scenes. Action sequences can be now dated as ""before Matrix"" and ""after Matrix"". And the two directors provide a lesson about how to use slow-motion with good taste.Some people say that ""The Matrix"" is a re-telling of the New Testament. So what? ""The Lord of the rings"" is another one, too. What I want to say is that, no matter how you see it, ""The Matrix"" has a very interesting plot, and scenes that always leave the viewers with their jaws hanging. And it has become one of the greatest references in movie-making.Grade 9.3/10"	5.0	The turning point	2004-10-15	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A2UU42Q09CWT24	J. S. Gilbert	The only people who don't like the Matrix, are those who are either unwilling or unable to understand it on a psychological level. I've seen this movie eight times and every single character, every line, every scene  is part of an intensely complicated metaphor that incorporates elements  from Christianity, Zen, Buddhism, the hacker subculture, the drug  subculture, various martial arts, etc.Those who dislike the Matrix, are  probably also uninterested in those subjects. Such individuals are probably  subconsciously unnerved by the message of the film, which is that unless  you find a way out, you are merely a &quot;copper top,&quot; I.E. battery  that fuels the machines that enslave you.The thing you have to realize,  is that this is not meant to be taken in a literal way but is instead  intended to be a psychological metaphor for the way we are enslaved by  mechanical thought processes that ultimately serve corporate interests and  not our own. The bad guys all wear business attire, the good guys wear  gothic-styled clothing.One must only venture onto  the Matrix bulletin board, to witness the vast outpouring of analysis of  this incredible motion picture. Even the acting (considering who they had)  is quite good.So, if you like to watch movies in order to furthur  hypnotize yourself away from the reality of your situation, then I  recommend against watching the Matrix, reading any books by Gurdjieff,  trying to understand the Beastie Boys, or meditation.	5.0	NOT just an action movie- Matrix has great spiritual depth	1999-08-05	0	0	0

The technology is green screens and floppy discs, telephones have dials and cell phones are the size of WalkeeTalkees.  But the construct of it is brilliant:  &#34;What is reality, how do you define real&#34;.  Neo (Mr. Anderson) believes he's a software designer for a large corporation by day, a computer hacker by night.  The truth is, he believes what he believes about his life because he's lost in the Matrix; he and all humans are no more than a power source for the real world that was taken over by machines almost a century before.  The life he knows doesn't exist at all.The acting is not very good, with Keanu Reeves delivering his usual disconnected performance.  But it's still one of the best little mind f---s out there and so worth watching every three months or so.  A real addiction.	4.0	Never mind the floppy discs! it's a classic.	2014-03-21	0	0	0

As ubiquitous as today's World Wide Web is, this film goes in a direction that takes electronic machines and their artificial intelligence to the extreme in which they take captive 99% of humanity.As dependent on machines, the internet and technology as we are - could all of that become greater than us and in turn rely on us for its survival?

0790745399	The Matrix	A200FYUVU6GG4P	"J. T. Nite ""mightybjorn"""	I went to see this movie with very high expectations, and found it failed to live up to most of the hype.  The fan hysteria over this flick is  completely incomprehensible to me -- I don't understand why this  outperformed the comparable Pitch Black or the superior Dark  City.Although there were some pretty computer effects and some exciting  fight sequences, the movie wore out its welcome quickly.  How many  explosions/actors fighting in flight harnesses/slow-mo gunplay does one  movie need?The plot and the visuals are recycled from better movies --  Blade Runner, Akira, Alien, even old Star Trek.  This movie doesn't have an  original thought in it -- it's just a blended puree of Anime, Kung Fu  movies, and old sci-fi.  I always giggle when I read about the &quot;deep  allegory&quot; of the film.  It's just a little Christ-figure with a little  Eastern Philosophy, and it serves as no more than window-dressing to an  essentially mindless movie.The weakest link by far is Keanu Reeves in  the lead role.  He has all the charisma and acting talent of a piece of  celery.  He's also got the wrong build for a hero -- when he starts  martial-arts posing he looks like a 98-pound weakling flexing in front of a  mirror.  I found myself laughing through most of his &quot;serious&quot;  scenes.Maybe the rabid fandom for this mediocre movie pushes me from  indifference to dislike, but the more people gush about this flick, the  less I like it.  It plays like some corporation's idea of cool, a  calculated attempt to make teens go &quot;Wow.&quot;  For that reason, it  occupies the same entertainment strata as N'Sync and Britney Spears.	2.0	Maybe if it hadn't been so hyped --	2000-08-27	10	5	5

When I first time was watching Matrix, I didn't understand a lot because I was so amazed about special effects. Second time I prepared to think and understanding result was much better. Third time I find more interesting details and realised that Matrix is one of the best action movies ever. Basic story goes like this. We are living in illusion world that which has made by someone. There is also another world where machines live. They have taken people for their slaves and are controlling us. We have to find a real saviour who can save for machines and forcoming human race destruction. The main character is Neo who will come to be a very important mission. First, He have to go to Matrix world where he can find Trinity and Morpheus who can help him for battle against to machines. You can find religious and philopsophius questions and thoughts in this film. Concentrate carefully and use your brain because this is not brainless action movie. This was the first movie that used a new rolling camera effect which came very popular for exemple Charlie's Angels has copied this camera effect. There is also a bad enemy called Mr. Smith which is very powerful, clever and nasty character!

The Matrix picked my world up and turned it inside out, and just when I'd  adjusted to that, it turned it upside down, too. You will truly be drawn in  by the cinematography. The special effects are seamless. I think that no  other movie at this time is more suited to DVD format than this one.  Inovation has always been a key factor in making a movie a classic film  (especially in the sci-fi genre) and The Matrix will surely be one of them.  It draws you in and when it's all over, it leaves you buzzing. Are you  ready for the next one?	5.0	There is no spoon	2000-05-14	2	2	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A1Q4Z2DTBTB6U	"JulieS ""julies_27"""	I saw this movie right when it came out, in a theater with a huge screen and dolby sound and all that, and I LOVED it.  It was dark, edgy, pushed a lot of boundaries and I was thinking about it for days afterwards.  Well, I  rented it again last week (and was thinking of buying it) but I found that  at the second viewing, the movie had really lost its edge for me.  When you  already know the intricasies of the plot and have already figured out where  the labyrinth goes, most of what is left is a bunch of special effects and  fight scenes.  Admittedly the special effects and fight scenes are  excellent examples of editing and high tech computer graphics, but the  movie did not draw me in on the second viewing and I'm glad I didn't buy a  copy of it.	3.0	Think before you buy	2000-04-28	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A18BV4O63DOWNH	"""juno2"""	Nice to know that my two cents will not be buried. . . .*The Matrix*, directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, is a purposefully non-user-friendly movie.  The directors make no effort to reach out to a general audience:  if you're not familiar with the terminology of  &quot;graphic&quot;  novels, geeky cyber-fi, and if you're under the age of, say, 40, then to hell with you.  Besides, as the film studios well know, the biggest audience for movies are boys between 14 and 21, which begs the question:  why BOTHER reaching out?  If you don't fit the demographic, who cares?  You're irrelevant.The movie is about a guy named Neo  (get it?  as in  &quot;One&quot; -- this is typical of the depth of thought that went into this story)  who is slowly awakened to the fact that the life he's been leading has all along been a fictional computer construct.  For the benefit of those in the audience who'd been forced -- kicking and screaming -- to read  &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;  in college, Neo is shown the  &quot;true&quot;  reality by swallowing a red pill, provided by a small group of reality-renegades led by Laurence Fishburne.  There are other allusive candies for the smart set:  Neo, for reasons unclear to him, gets dragged away and interrogated by interchangeable bureaucrats  (think Kafka); even the very ending hints at Wagnerian opera.  But rest assured:  there's nothing very intellectual going on here -- only proof that the Wachowskis received a liberal education.Needless to say, many of the plot elements fail to hold up under scrutiny.  Just for starters, you would be a chronic cripple if you lay in a coma for 20 or so years, but that's just one minor item the story breezes over.  The directors ask you to suspend your disbelief over a grand canyon of impossibilities, illogical plot mechanisms, on and on.  To top it all off, we're given howlingly irrealistic special effects -- these characters commence flying all over the place; they get shot, fall down, dust it off, and continue kickboxing; they hang suspended in mid-air . . . evidently they're made to resemble the video-game characters whom the targeted audience spends so much time with.  The Wachowski brothers aren't merely directing a movie; they're putting on The Greatest SHOW On Earth.  Well, as P.T.  Barnum once said, &quot;There's a sucker born every minute.&quot;	2.0	Wow! 2122 reviews!	2000-12-28	11	2	9

0790745399	The Matrix	A1QHYYND7Q7ZOE	Justin Lowry	&quot;No one can be told what the Matrix is.&quot;  That is the claim of the film - and the teaser hook for the movie.  Yet, ironically, the Matrix is an old plot device used many times before in other science fiction, from  &quot;Star Trek&quot; to the &quot;Outer Limits&quot;.  But while &quot;The  Matrix&quot; lacks in uniqueness, it does have style and some very clever,  very well done action sequences.  If nothing else, the movie excels in its  special effects and cinematography.  Even the story is entertaining, if not  very deep.But there is one flaw that cannot be brushed off as simply bad  filmmaking.  The heroes of the film show a disturbing level of enjoyment in  destroying the villains, and even in killing the rather innocent  &quot;unenlightened&quot; citizens of the Matrix.  Unlike some other  &quot;softer&quot; action movies, the characters of &quot;The Matrix&quot;  hold a cold attitude that is downright creepy.  In an escapist movie like  &quot;The Matrix&quot;, this kind of thing is bad.  If it does not disturb  us and turn us off, then it de-sensitizes us.At its best, &quot;The  Matrix&quot; is only a clever, action movie and at its worst it is a  cold-hearted, shallow film.	3.0	Expert effects, but overrated and at times disturbing...	2000-06-28	6	1	5

Unfortunately, I only had half of the fun because the sound level of the disc I received has only about half of what normal videos should be. I had to crank the amplifier, but the quality is not a theater like. I contacted Amazon customer service and was promptly offered to return it. She explained Amazon gets those discs from vendors like any of the stores. I'd like to think this is a one-off experience. With Amazon's policy, I'm not worried and certainly will buy more Blu ray discs. But be aware.Actually this is the first time I watch a Blu ray not counting the occasional glance at Best Buy floor. It's an &#34;old&#34; movie. I bought it because this movie is a milestone for Hollywood production. As such, I have very high expectation on the time spent on viewing it again.

0790745399	The Matrix	A37I2C8WJUTTVJ	Karen Y	You don't need me to tell you how incredibly amazing this movie is, how stunning the graphics, or how complex the plot. It is quite obvious already, seeing as The Matrix has been out on DVD for more than a few  months and it is STILL at the top of the charts.The Matrix is about a  man named Neo who leads a double life. He contributes to society just as  everybody else does, but somehow he knows that there is something missing  in his life: The Matrix. He doesn't know what it is, and he doesn't know  who &quot;Morpheus&quot; is, but he's been looking for both his whole  life...and both have been searching for him.This is a movie about  realization and fate. Both play a big part in Neo's character development.  Aside from all this, The Matrix is a sci-fi action thriller. It has been  compared to the great &quot;Star Wars&quot; and rightly so because the  screenplay for this movie was written as only the second chapter of a  trilogy. Sound familiar? In a year or two, the sequel to The Matrix will  come out, followed by a prequel (so for those of you who pooh-poohed the  seemingly brief romantic development of Trinity and Neo, it's only the  beginning).If you want to buy a movie worth watching twice, or 50+  times, I assure you that this is the one and only choice. Think of every  genre there is; it's right in this film. Moreover, this movie has  revolutionalized movie making. It's special effects alone are worth buying  the dvd for. But the most compelling reason: If you want to fuss over and  obsess about something truly wonderful that represents how advanced our  culture is, WATCH THIS.	5.0	History in the making	2000-03-15	6	5	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A2B2NJW5R7M8K9	"""kasper3"""	&quot;The Matrix&quot;, for all its unique plot variations, is a simple tale of man wanting more &quot;than just this&quot;. We look at the stars at night and go through the motions each day on a small dot within the  incomprehensible vastness of space and tell ourselves that there must be  something else besides just going through the motions. &quot;The  Matrix&quot; offers a theory that reality is an illusion. We gravitate to  the message, but ignore the foundation from which the theory is derived.  We'd much prefer to believe our lives are pre=programmed and are a grand  illusion than to accept biological finiteness and responsibility for our  actions. Blame it on the machines we ourselves create - gotta love  it!A great movie with wonderous techno-effects, but one wonders why so  many gravitate to a movie which has at its premise that reality is a  facade.I give it five stars not because of its message, but because it  is entertainment at its best. Yet, at the same time, its popularity  disturbs me because so many wish it wasn't entertainment, but truth.Have we come so far that we desire to negate ourselves so quickly?  Wiping a child's tear away or hugging a loved one does more to compensate  for the alienation of the modern world than wishing &quot;The Matrix&quot;  to be true.	5.0	The &quot;reality&quot; of life seeks something more, always!	2000-04-11	1	1	0

An excellent storyline written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, brilliant acting from Laurence Fishburne, Keanu Reaves and supporting cast, and enough action to keep you  on the edge of your seats until the sequel comes out.  Very basically the  film is about the matrix. It is an elaborate deception, only to us real as  life gets. We humans are reduced to a battery to keep the artificial  intelligence we originally created alive, and in turn this keeps us out of  interfering with their ultimate scheme of things. Not all of us accept  this.  This film is done extremely well in every manner. The way the film  is shot gives you that almost dreamlike feeling when necessary, the action  scenes are better than I have seen in any film before, the lobby scene  especially. The script very well put together, has an excellent soundtrack  and has the humour all in the right places.  The worst thing about this  film is that they almost convince us they're right, and we the audience are  in the matrix too.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1TI1JMH87OP1A	Kedar Joshi	This film is great. It is great not because it is action-packed, but because it is very philosophical. If it leads to fundamental questions like `Is reality an illusion?', then it points to the NSTP (Non - Spatial Thinking Process) theory, the idea that space is a virtual reality, a form of non-spatial mind. So according to the theory not space and spatial entities but non-spatial feelings or states of consciousness are the real physical or material substance in the universe. And there is probably a central non-spatial program that controls or modulates these (human or any non-superhuman) feelings. This idea, a major part of the superultramodern science, is supposed to be a possible solution to most of the most challenging problems in modern science/philosophy, including the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics. Though we live in a spatial matrix, in reality the universe has no geometry. See the film. And read the theory. It might change the way you look at the world and yourself.	5.0	The NSTP (Non - Spatial Thinking Process) Theory	2006-02-19	1	1	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A255DD5NKP1210	Kehoe	"This movie has my unqualified recommendation. It has some of the best action, stunts, and visuals I have ever seen. The story is good also. It has good acting by Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne's parts. What is The Matrix? Well, the people who live, in their day in and day-out world, believe it is real. But it isn't real, it is just a mere software program, to shield our eyes from the truth. That software program that we believe is real, is called The Matrix. What is the truth? Well, sometime in the early 21st century, mankind celebrated over their marvel, their creation. AI: Artificial Intelligence. A singular consciousness that spawned a whole new race, of machines. They don't know who struck first, people or the machines. But it was us who blackened the sky, because we believed that without an energy source as abundent as the sun, they would die. The human body generates more bioelectricity than a 120 volt battery, combined with a source of fusion, the machines had found all the energy source they would ever need. So, the machines created fields of endless fields, where humans are no longer ""born"", we are grown. The machines created a ""program"" to control the people inside The Matrix. They can do things that seems impossible, like dodge bullets and other things. These ""programs"" are called Agents. Anyone who has fought an Agent, has died. When The Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside it, who had the ability change whatever he wanted, to remake The Matrix as he so fit. He was the one who set the first humans free to the real world. That man died, but an oracle said that he would return, to free humans from The Matrix, because as long as it exists, humans will never be free. So, Morpheus found Neo, who Morphues believes is ""The One"". But is he? An action movie at its best, that has stuning action scenes that no one can out do, except for maybe The Matrix Reloaded, the sequel.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1VZLLDNLURGJB	Keith Mirenberg	The Matrix (1999) was a great five star sci-fi film experience with a great plot, good acting, great first time special effects and lots of action. The film treated an old sci-fi idea concerning the nature of reality that I first encountered in a 50's book by Arthur C. Clarke.  However, it added a great deal to this idea and provided great appeal with the computer generation by having its hero be a young programmer and computer hacker named Neo.  Neo learns we are all the captives of an Artifical Intelligence (AI) and that our entire world is nothing but an elaborate program. We the people are only permitted to live because the computers depend on us for thermoelectric energy. Way out there but lots of fun.	5.0	The Matrix (1999)-One of the best sci-fi flicks ever made!	2009-08-23	1	1	0
0790745399	The Matrix	AVUZRNQBB3S6G	Keith Nichols	This flick is all computerized special effects and characters who are as bloodless as the computers.  That is, the effects are fun but the people are of little concern, since they have no reality -- being involved instead with leaping great distances through the air, walking on walls, and dodging bullets. The plot seems to involve the premise that everyboy has been created or controlled by a computer somewhere.  The principals, who may be human beings, lie about hooked up to a computer aboard some sort of vehicle.  What we see on the screen appears to be what's going on in their brains.  Then there are other human-like creatures trying to hunt them down.  Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburn sort all this out.	2.0	Looks good but no people	2003-05-10	9	3	6

Not only is it entertaining in itself, but it is an outstanding example of the director's craft.  It's full of little touches, such as the spoon rack behind Neo's head just  before the spoon-bending sequence, or the repeated visual effect of the  matrix code (such as in the rain on the car windows and the soap on the  office window).  I've seen the film at least half a dozen times, and I pick  up something new each time.. it's a gem on multiple levels.  It's a bit  dark, though nowhere near as dark as BladeRunner or 12 Monkeys.

0790745399	The Matrix	A26YXBNERXOJCS	Kent T. Keller	Contary to what has been written about this film, I don't see anything ground breaking, but only cliche'.  The reluctant messiah story is as old as Buddha, Jesus, and Burt Reynolds in the Longest Yard.  Even worst, it takes forever to more this tired story along.  I felt insulted as a viewer with average smarts by the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; reference.For all the CGI hype, it is just that.  Slow motion bullets with trails have been done years before in &quot;Sniper.&quot;  I am surprised that the few scenes of over the top gun play where the good guys never get hit still plays with the young who seem to love this movie.  There is nothing visionary about taking bad Bruce Lee knock-off fight scenes and put them to slow motion.Production value and cinematography is a disappointment too.  Under exposure, and bluing doesn't create a mood, but does creates good night light of two plus hours of sleep.	2.0	Slow motion masking a bad film	2002-07-31	10	2	8

Never have I EVER been so energized about life after watching this  movie. Think of Neo as FDR. Think of Neo as Patton or Rommel. Think of Neo  as Jesus Christ. Every time a different story behind it. But the moral  remains clear: Always go through life with a second glance at things.  Always think about things at least two different ways before you appreciate  them. Remember Patch Adams? There's eight fingers, not four.To sum up  the movie, let me just use a quote: &quot;There is no spoon.&quot;	5.0	Many ways to view it, millions of ways to interpret it!	1999-09-07	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A3E2FVB2RFPBKA	Kerri	Since I'm not what can be called a fan of sci-fi or Keanu Reeves, I wasn't sure this movie would be for me.  Was I ever wrong!  'The Matrix' is the  complete package: stunning, mind-bending special effects, perfect casting,  brilliant directing, and a story that stands on its own.The visual  effects are truly a marvel to view, and deservedly won an Oscar in this  category.  Fortunately, there's 26 'bonus' minutes of footage at the end of  the film explaining how much of it was done.Keanu Reeves is perfectly  cast as Neo in this film- he excels at looking confused and has  (thankfully) minimal dialogue.  He does have a great physique which makes  for a fantastic 'action-hero'.  Laurence Fishburne turns in a fine  performance as the cryptic Morpheus; his voice alone keeps one's attention  in a way reminiscent of James Earl Jones'.  The real 'star' of the film,  though, is Carrie-Ann Moss, who lights up the screen as Trinity. Beautiful,  smart and independent, she gives this film a soul and prevents it from  crossing into a stereotypical sci-fi 'annihilate the bad guys' film filled  with techno-babble.This is a film which *must* be seen more than once in  order to fully appreciate all the hints and clues given early on in the  film.  Not only is a second viewing necessary, but it's enjoyable- again,  the special effects are magnificent and have to be seen to be believed.  It's definitely a film you shouldn't miss!	5.0	Not Your Typical Sci-Fi	2000-08-03	4	3	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A26G35WR7QCFR2	Kevbo	"Movies weren't made like The Matrix before it came out.  The movie is revolutionary in so many ways; so much so that we now take it for granted as it seems most movie-makers try to emulate the style(s).Just having the 120-or-so cameras positioned in the circular pattern to show the jump kicks or the famous dodging of the bullets scene had never before been considered.  If you are the type who doesn't care about storylines and just wants to watch fast-moving Kung Fu, you can get that from The Matrix easy.But let's say you appreciate well-developed, finely engrained storylines with awesome depth...  Well, The Matrix boasts one of the finest stories ever created.  It mirrors the anxiety of the classic conspiracy theory movies, yet provides excellent tie-ins with common life.  The Matrix offers analogies regarding regular, daily life, then magically connects them to that vast conspiracy that no one is aware of.The biggest kick I get out of the movie is that is plays on nearly every personality type.  For example, you know those people who swear ""everybody else"" is ignorant and living in the dark?  ""They don't know how to raise their children!""  ""They aren't smart enough to understand what I am talking about!""  ""If they only knew what I know!""  Etcetera.  Well, imagine being an insider on The Matrix!Or how about the other personality of the conspiracy theorists?  ""The government is behind everything!""  ""The Illuminati are only a few people who control the whole world!""  Etcetera.  Ho, boy.Or the rock-'em-up, sock-'em'up types that just giggle and chuckle when a bad guy gets his hiney handed to him in a swift, bad-butt kind of way...The Matrix is philosophically DEEP, and the action is the best around, even nowadays.  This movie is a classic, folks, and it was instantly so.  It set the standard for action movies to come, and it will always be a great watch.  If you are one of the few folks who hasn't purchased the DVD yet, I encourage you to find the Trilogy set and buy it.  I often make ""Matrix weekends"" for myself.Oh, and if you are female or are considering watching The Matrix series with one - but you know she is not really into this sort of movie - tell her it is a love story.  You won't be lying - most of Neo's (the main character) major decisions originate from his love for a woman.And even though I am not a huge fan of Keanu Reeves, you will not be able to see anything poorly done until the second episode.

How could a film hosting Keanu's brilliant acting abilitys steal some of  'The Phantom Menace's' thunder.  I'll tell you why!  Breath-taking action  and fight sequences, amazingly cheesy dialogue.  Yes, you got it in one!  Even cheesier than the dialogue found in 'The Phantom Menace.'One  major problem, maybe the action scenes are too few and the explanation of  the matrix too many.

When I first went to go see this movie I didn't  know what to expect. Everything was a surprise. They didn't give away  anything in the previews.Which is good. this is where most movies fail. I  found myself still talking about this movie a month after I saw it. I  couldn't get it out of my mind. I've never seen a movie like it in my life.  I'm still unclear of what the matrix is because I think It's more complex  than a simple definition.The only bad thing about the movie is that the  violence should of been replaced by martial arts. then it would of been  hype. However, the people in Hollywood can't stop the urge to just shoot  things up. They glamourized guns in this movie. And I saw kids in the movie  theatre!

0790745399	The Matrix	A37JKM7EFD0DIQ	K.H.	"The Wachowski brothers have delivered an exciting movie, though not completely new - but knowntheless, good plot and ""what is the real?"" - and ""Good vs Evil"" theme.  It is amazing, with so much going on, that they are able to deliver, partly because of innovative filming, a concise and interesting movie.Though some reviewers have critically ""slamed"" Keanu Reeves' acting ability, he is no doubt a perfect fit as he brillintly pulls off a confused, searching young man, trying to find his destiny.  His calling, like many people in real life, is mulled and contemplated.  In one instance, he is a messaih figure, more like ""King David"" than Christ, and in other instances, he is a superhero with extreme power.Fishburne is perfect as Morpheous, the mentor and ""minor prophet.""  Carrie Ann Moss, is compelling as Trinity, a high-flying...kickn' women who falls in love with Neo (Reeves).I am not normally a ""special effects"" person, but I must admit, I found effects in this movie to be pure genius.  There was enough to WOW one, yet, not too much to take away from the movie.  One Amazon reviewer didn't like the martial arts scenes, but these mostly Kung Fu scenes are a perfect fit for this type of film.  Sure it isn't Bruce Lee, but for a bunch of actors, it is very well done.  Stunt doubles for fight sequences are kept to a minmium so the contnuity in the characters shows - a major plus.The villians, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano are extremely good in their respective parts.

The movie makes you think, which is something I cannot say for most of the movies being produced today. The sound and technology involved in this movie are beyond  words, and the acting is the best I have seen in years. I may only be 16,  but I have seen a lot of movies in my days and there aren't any cornball  lines in The Matrix that makes the movie lose it's seriousness. I definite  must see, then see again.	5.0	AWESOME	2000-05-03	1	1	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A2W6SI073FIRMA	KlownArt	The MatrixThis movie should be in everyone's collection. The Matrix one of those movies that just has something special about it. I personally don't think it's perfect, but I agree that you need this in your collection. This is probably one of my favorite series of movies.You follow a character named Neo. Neo has lived a fairly normal life as a hacker. He has been tracking down a man named Morpheous, and the strange aura that attracts Neo to Morpheous. Neo eventually meets Morpheous and a group of people. Morpheous asks Neo is he wants to know what The Matrix is. The story is kind of weird because Neo seems to know everything without being told about it. He knows about the Matrix already, but has no idea what it is. I don't know if that makes sense, but I'm just trying to say he's heard of everything already. Anyway, Neo says yes. He is than asks to take a pill if he wants to know the truth. Neo takes the pill and appears in world he's never seen before.He turns out to be in the Real World, and the world he used to be in was the computer program called The Matrix. Neo learns that machines rule humans. The machines now grow humans to produce electricity for themselves. The survivors are now struggling to fight off these machines. Morpheous believes that Neo is what a prophecy called The One. The One was supposed to end the war bring peace to everyone.The movie has a real Alice in Wonderland feel to it. He is sucked out of his world and put in a mysterious new world. The story takes awhile to get going, but once it gets going it is great. You will see heart-pounding action, great story telling, and insane camera work.Extras include your basic behind the scenes and commentary along with a few other things. These are all good to watch. I don't think they are enough to up this movie to a 5 star though.Like I said at the beginning of the review, you need this in your collection. If your collection consists of only a few movies, this should be one of them.	4.0	Classic	2008-07-17	3	2	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A29MWKUZ0FU1W	Kokeshi088 (A Random *Sensible*  Constructive...	Now, as I can last recall, this movie.... I can't remember anyhting since 1999.It's almost like a DragonballZ episode, all action, then about 3 years later, you forgot EVERYTHING. I mean, just about everywhere, people remember exactly WHO said, &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot;.I say that the plot was bland at some point; where there are two sides, there are two stories, and being the picky eprson I am, I would have personally liked to see more emphasis on the &quot;other&quot; side, the Machines. Worse enough, I can also say that while the idea is interesting...I still say it doesn't make sense. If a machine was to become that intelligent, then some things would be obselete, another, the technological terms are a bit too... today? I mean, way back when, who ever heard of a &quot;lightsaber&quot;? Yeah, NOBODY! Creativity, huh? Huh? I mean, yeah, I can see hacker in the future, but the word &quot;program&quot;? Oh, COME ON!Otherwise, I'd like to see much stronger emphasis on the other side(s) as well as something to totally screw up the plot and make it harder for &quot;Neo&quot; (Keanu Reeves). After seeing &quot;Reloaded&quot;, I was primarily disappointed with the slownesss of the story, still, unlike the confusing &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; here. I'm a geek. Shoot me.Also, here's a little common sense: Isn't it a bit.... wrong if former slaves enslave their masters?Other than that, for me, I'm not too happy with how the characterization was done, could have had more personality here, no? Also, here's a problem HUMANITY! Isn't this (hu)man vs. machine? And isn't the perspective MOST people are viewing the humans? Darn, we really screwed up our race then, if this is the meaning of being human.No, really, in a lot of movies like this it seems that we humans have forgotten what it means to be human! Hence our punishment. Other than that, get ready to hear my Reloaded rants someday! Because I'll have a LOT.Like a FEW other people out there, yes, I was rooting for the machines. But for other reasons than the fact that the movie &quot;sucked&quot;.And yes, we really have forgotten what it means to be human, not to mention the human characters hardly seemed *ahem* human, sentient, and/or understanding.I think the only thing people think of when we say &quot;human&quot; is the human race. That's it. I'm sorry, but, if that's the new meaning to the word &quot;human&quot;, then shoot me. I don't wanna be human anymore. (I'd much rather be a half-eaten ham and cheese sandwich, right now...)I mean, isn't there supposed to be a plot? *ahem* PLOT??? And emphasis.A movie with this much philosophy needs a stronger plot and more than just one perspective. This movie, it's all just really one-sided.And the reason WHY this movie is no longer on my perosnal &quot;top movies list&quot; and why I gave it such a beating. Which really isn't that much, but this is constructive criticism, mind you.~Kokeshi088~P.S. I think out of the box.

Laurence Fishburne does a marvelous job as Morpheus, and the Wachowski brothers spin a tale so engrossing and believable that you may look at your whole world a little differently afterwards- it leaves the viewer to do a lot of philosophical insight.	5.0	When you see this, you'll be dying for the sequel!	2002-01-06	2	0	2

Since then I rewatched it perhaps a dozen times or so. I know the dialogue, I know what happens next all the way to the end, but I still watch it.This is escapism of the cleverest sort. Incredibly stylized, designed, almost perfect pacing, witty and yet simple symbolic dialogue...After the first viewing I'd give it a perfect score. After subsequent viewings you feel that the action sequences really hold back some of the intellectual potential of this film.However, the original ideas presented and the way in which they are presented is very very nice.My one gripe with the plot... Why do machines need human bodies for energy? Their technical intelligence is much greater than humans' so why not just build fusion reactors?It would be much more believable if the reason were that machines were conducting an experiment, investigation of human behavior, studying their creators in order to answer questions about their own existence. That purpose was also suggested in the sequels.Despite the flaws I'm gonna stand by the first viewing. 5 stars[as strange as it may sound I actually thought at the beginning that Morpheus and the rest are the bad guys and agents are good, with the whole  ""...he is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive..."" line suggesting he's a terrorist or something of that kind. guess I'm really easy to brain wash LOL.

0790745399	The Matrix	AV143DN59ELGO	Kristofer Pierson	The Matrix turned out to meet most of my expectations after hearing so much from friends about this film.  Special effects were fantastic.  Acting was pretty good as well, even for some &quot;unheard of&quot; actors in the  suppoting roles.  Reeves and Fishbourne were on par, although I wanted to  see more action out of Fishbourne.On the whole, the movie will not sit  well with folks who cannot let their minds wander into the complex realm of  sci-fi.  If you do not want to slip into this format of entertainment for  even a few minutes, let alone the whole two hours, don't even hit the play  button.For those of us who appreciate the genre, The Matrix has a  creative premise supported by well known sci-fi elements and gimmicks (i.e.  AI vs. humans, high-tech hackers taking on the world, icky buglike robots,  etc.)  Packing the film with action (guns and kung-fu) was merely icing on  the cake.

0790745399	The Matrix	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	"The Matrix will go down in film history books as ""The film that changed cinema forever"". True, films have done that before: (Jaws, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction et al) but the Matrix is different in that not only did it change audience's expectations of action cinema but also impacted on countless movies to date.The film itself is the epitome of cool that stands out from the slew of unimaginative science fiction that Hollywood reels out, and with Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss making an unlikely duo in a post-apocalyptic world ruled by artificially intelligent machines, the film finds itself worlds away from admittedly second-rate sci fi cinema.You could argue, as some critics did, that the film's plot is simply an excuse to hang cool effects on, but the premise slowly shapes into such an intricate plot, where machines have taken over the world (a popular idea for sci fi films, with this having similarities to Terminator 2) and then the small amount of snotty critics are silenced. What the Wachowski brothers have done is so imaginative that no film has ever come close to its intricacies and futuristic ideas. Add hints and nudges from Vertigo, classic Western films and Kung-fu karate films into the story and the amazing journey is made even more fascinating and involving.The visuals incorporated throughout the story are absolutely amazing; with the ""flow-mo"" being the coolest visual effect those effects boffins have done since that water tentacle flowed through air in The Abyss. Imitated to death, the scene where Keanu's character Neo dodges bullets is nonetheless the pinnacle of uber-coolness. With thought provoking, mind-bending lines like: ""It's the smell, if there is such a thing""; the film's script is peppered with fascinating lines concerning the very nature of ""what is real?""  Hence the clever advertising campaign for the movie's release: ""Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself"".The Matrix has indeed changed cinema. Regardless, it's a great film, loaded to the retinas with out- of- this-world effects, great villians (Agent Smith!), great action set-pieces and awesome stunts from martial arts expert Wu Ping. And with the DVD (awesome stuff, everyone has to own this disc) and upcoming sequel in progress- The Matrix Reloaded, the Matrix is a film that not only has affected filmgoers everywhere, but has also leaked into the fan boy culture of the movie world.

Wyatt ""ssintrepid"""	"The Matrix is simply one of the most visually stunning and intellectually enthralling Science Fiction/Action Adventure films to be produced in recent history.  It is the quintessential film of the nineties and now the new millennium.  Amazingly enough; at the time of its release I was working extremely long hours and didn't even see a trailer for it so I missed it at the theater.  After hearing so many good things about it, I purchased it and was absolutely floored by its originality; mind blowing action and compelling plot.  The Wachowski Brothers deserve nothing but the highest praise that they continue to receive for putting this story to paper and the silver screen.I've never been much of a Keanu Reeves fan but that opinion definitely changed with this movie and I'm sure will continue with its follow on movies ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions.""  He is absolutely perfect in the role.  Laurence Fishburne in the role of Morpheus is outstanding as usual, making it seem as if the role was made for him.  In the role of Trinity is the ever so beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss whose hard work and stunning gorgeousness shines brilliantly on the silver screen and the home theater screen.  Hugo Weaving performing as Agent Smith is nothing less than perfect in the role of the nemesis.  Joe Pantoliano delivers another great performance in the role of good guy turned bad.Combining a brilliant story and superb directing by the Wachowski brothers with superb performances by the aforementioned actors brings forth what is most likely one of the best Science Fiction/Action &amp; Adventure flicks of the nineties and the catalyst for this years release of the sequels which are both expected to reach astronomical levels at the box office.The premise:Thomas Anderson a.k.a. Neo is living two lives, by day he's a computer programmer who is seemingly living by all the rules as Thomas Anderson, by night he's Neo, a computer hacker who is breaking every computer derived law in the book.  For quite some time he's also had the strangest feeling that everything is not as it seems.  He begins to hear rumors of someone named Morpheus and something called ""The Matrix.""  Suddenly, while he's searching for Morpheus, Morpheus seeks him out and then Mr. Anderson's world is turned inside out...  What follows from there is as stated above, one of the most compellingly well written Science Fiction/Action &amp; Adventure flicks to grace the silver screen and the home theater in quite some time.  This is a movie that can be watched repeatedly and it's just as exciting as the first time you watched it!I ""highly"" recommend this film to all who are interested in a ""great"" movie that is unbelievable in its scope and detail and perfect even in its minor trivialities.  {ssintrepid}"	5.0	The Matrix - The Ultimate Sci-Fi/Action &amp; Adventure Flick!	2003-05-23	5	2	3

0790745399	The Matrix	A37H0710YMCLYF	Kyriakos Xagoraris	After watching countless movies in my life, I've really come to a point that I believe we all know what to expect in each movie even before it's shot. The same storylines, same structure over and over again. So, in the  quest to find that novelty, the original movie, the original story,  something that hasn't been done over and over and over, I was kind of  honoured to be offered this movie to watch. It is surely a 5-star winner.  Get it, or miss the opportunity to relive the definition of entertainment.	5.0	The Matrix DOES have you...	2000-02-25	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A1YUXCJIALBEQB	Lady Bug	"I've watched this movie probably 250 times by the time I'm now writing this, and every time I see it again I still find it to be one of the very best science fiction movies I've ever seen.  It's the kind of movie you never get bored with.In the beginning, I had a hard time figuring out who was the good guy, in the middle I was saying ""what the ...?"" and by the end I was wanting to see it again and actually liking Keanu Reeves as an actor.One thing I definitely noticed were the whole Second Coming overtones:- Morpheus as John the Baptist- Cipher as Judas- A character named ""Trinity""- Neo dying once and being resurrected- Morpheus' ship named the Nebuchadnezzar- etc. etc. etc.At any rate, I thought that this was a pretty cool spin on an old prophecy, not to mention the Taoist themes as well.The Matrix is definitely a package deal - you get plot, effects, action, drama, even martial arts all in one movie.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1CDZNPO7U4E6N	LadyLestat	I thought the special effects of this movie was outstanding. The story was well-written, mindblowing, and very original. It got me to thinking that if we were really in a &quot;Matrix&quot; for real, &quot;Would I want to be unplugged&quot;?. I think this movie is definitely one of Keanu's best movies, and it will probably go down as one of the best movies of all time. I really loved the fight scenes because Trinity and Neo both rock the screen. I have never saw anything like &quot;The Matrix&quot;, and I doubt if I ever will again.	4.0	Innovative, Original, Action-packed!! Keanu at his best!!!!!	2001-08-05	3	1	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A2NUHWMHA9XNKV	Lady Raven RAVE!	The Matrix The Matrix is a science fiction and action movie starring some of the biggest actors like Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano . It was directed and written by Larry and Andy Wachowski. The Matrix is about an computer hacker who goes by the name Neo (Keanu) . He's been searching for the answer to the eternal question: What Is The Matrix ? Later in his quest , he finds a hacker named Morpheus(Laurence) who tells him what the matrix really is, its just a computer program. Morpheus then shows Neo the real world out of the matrix , but the reason why Morpheus needs Neo is because he believes that Neo is the one who will stop the machines and give them their freedom. My Favorite scene was when Neo went threw training. I think this is a really good movie and you should see it.Also Recommended: I also enjoyed the Matrix Reloaded and the Matrix Revolutions	5.0	(:D)	2006-05-24	0	0	0

I couldn't wait 3 months!  I wanted it now!  So what to  do?  Buy a DVD player of course, and man I can't look back now!  This movie  proved to me how great genre flicks like this can be on DVD.  The sound is  amazing, and the video is great.  There is no way I could watch this movie  in full-frame after seeing all those Kung-Fu sequences in widescreen!  How  could I have ever been stupid enough to think full-frame was better?  And  then I found all the cool extra stuff you could do with this DVD.  Best  money I ever spent!

0790745399	The Matrix	A1004AX2J2HXGL	Lao Che	"What's all the ballyhoo about?  Genre defining?  Maybe if the genre was SUCK.  How could 50,000 [MATRIX] fans be wrong?  For every reason in the book.  I guess you have to be hooked up to a hoover vacuum cleaner to really enjoy this useless, dead-fly-on-the-sill, dust-ball-in-the-corner, two-year-old-christmas-tinsel of a movie.  I can just hear one of the ten-thousand copies of THE MATRIX video talking to me as I pass it by in the local rental store, ""Why do you hate me?  Why don't you just simmer down...""First of all, Keanu Reeves is about as wooden an actor as you can get.  Even Mark Hamill had some depth playing an everyman, blank slate of an action hero who takes a similar archetypal journey.  I'm just surprised Keanu had brains enough to take the correct pill so this shinola-load of a plot could continue.  But I digress?  Larry ""Laurence"" Fishburne plays his part like he's recording a books-on-tape version of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.  I'm surprised, because he worked out so well in SCHOOL DAZE and APOCALYPSE NOW.  But I can't fault the actors really, they were handed this shlock of a script to a movie which has every yo-yo thinking they are better off somehow for having experienced this?  I guess this flick is about as challenging, mentally, as that other over-rated junkpile GLADIATOR.  Does all this cheap philosophy really get the brain tumors worked up?  Its like dropping a shiney object in a pond and watching all the fish clamor after it.  This movie was actually pretty bland and full of holes if you remove the special effects.  I found the references to ALICE IN WONDERLAND heavy-handed and cheesey.  I love ALICE IN WONDERLAND and recommend sitting down to read that book as an alternative to viewing this snooze of a movie.  I was surprised they didn't use the Jefferson Airplane song WHITE RABBIT - or at least have a techno-monstrosity version of it?  Maybe they did and I was too zoned out of boredom to notice.""Wow, we are really in an faux-reality controlled by the very machines we created?  Sheesh - you don't say?  Better roll out some special effects to put a hurtin' to these roving mongoloid footballs...""  THE ORACLE should have tried cooking up some fried eggs, because the cast was certainly wearing it on their faces.  I guess the only redeeming ounce of quality in this thing was the certifiably cool robo-villain, AGENT SMITH.  I was amazed by him - he was like a DEVO record actualized.  Stomping, in his own special Agent Smith way, on the skulls of our thinly drawn heroes.  I imagined Agent Smith wearing a huge DELETE button around his neck, erasing this movie as he went along.  Then, there were so many of him in the sequel MATRIX RELOADED - THE SEARCH FOR MORE MONEY, I felt certain at least one of the Agent Smiths would have a DELETE button stowed away in his breast pocket?  That would have been worth the eight bucks.  But now I'm obviously getting into SPACEBALLS territory.  I couldn't get this far without offering some alternative selections to cure a paying audience of this infection, now could I?  For starters: in addition to SPACEBALLS, 2001: A SPACE ODYESSEY, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, BLADERUNNER, ALIEN(S), TOTAL RECALL, STARSHIP TROOPERS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, MARS ATTACKS, 12 MONKEYS, THE THING, THEY LIVE!, TIME BANDITS, THX-1138, ENEMY MINE, PREDATOR and ROBOCOP - I offer the darkly brilliant DARK CITY.  Yes, this movie will be observed as slow and boring by the five star gushers here; but in terms of originality, vibrance, and just plain storytelling know-how -  well it leaves THE MATRIX slithering in the dust.  DARK CITY was like Alfred Hitchcock had returned from his deep carbon freeze, slipped on a pair of nice fitting SCI-FI shoes and went to bat for us one more time.So, to answer the video copy of THE MATRIX sitting on the local store shelf, ""why do you hate me so?""  Well, I don't hate you.  I just think you are a mindless twerp of a movie that champions every idiotic impulse imaginable in the American psyche.  This thing is about as sophisticated as a Broadway musical.  NEO is a vapid, mindless puke of a character if I ever saw one - and the casting of TED LOGAN in that role was probably the only right move the directors made?  CAPTAIN EO - sorry, I meant NEO - wants to rock and roll so badly, that it hurts.  Better call Deputy Van Halen in to save the day!  This movie deserves half a star - but I gave it two stars only because they represent the two hours of my life I will never get back.  This is the only consolation I could find... for now.Good luck boys, I'm sure the series will be a hit."	2.0	Morpheus and Neo's Excellent Adventure	2003-10-13	8	5	3
0790745399	The Matrix	A1J1HDG9NOSU7Q	Larry Bagby	"First of all this is my all time favorite movie. Prior to ordering this bluray version I've watched the dvd I have probably 15 times. But, the bluray is so stunning that I look at it as an entirely new movie. It is so clear that you can see the pores on the faces of all the actors. This sounds like a ""yuk"" thing, but, believe me, if the pores are so outstanding everything else is even more amazing.Now the bad news: it may just be this disk, but the ""In Movie Experience"" i.e. the commentaries reset to play automatically each time I stop or eject the movie. When reviewing the location in Special Features to turn it ""Off"", it already says ""Off"" but plays anyway. The only way I found to stop it is to turn it ""On"" then go back and turn it ""Off"". This only works for this one time I'm playing, but, as before it comes back by itself even though it still says ""Off"". I'm trying to get the disk exchanged, but it's only been two days since I submitted my request.

0790745399	The Matrix	A399KZHAAWEBF5	Larry W Ausbrooks	With rare exception (&quot;Parenthood,&quot; &quot;Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot;), Keanu Reeves is a detriment to every film he appears in.  We've all seen him destroy great films like &quot;Devil's  Advocate&quot; and &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula.&quot;  This time, Keanu,  don't feel bad, it wasn't you.  The script in this film stinks!  In a  strange attempt to tell the story of Jesus Christ through a futuristic  sci-fi film (doesn't sound like a bad idea, right?) this picture only  manages to showcase the latest in CGI effects. I must mention, however, the  one reason I gave this picture 2 stars instead of one:  Hugo Weaver is  brilliant as Agent Smith!  He is also fortunate to have the only good lines  in the film when Smith is telling Neo what he thinks of the human race and  our world.

0790745399	The Matrix	A34WF9OU9Y5QFR	Leif-Atle Heen	There's no denying the huge significance of this George Orwell-inspired movie. It is probably the best movie of 1999 (perhaps exceeded only by Star Wars). Of course, it will be one of the ultimate classics of the 90's.  However, claiming that The Matrix is the best movie ever is a little  farfetched. It is probably better than Rocky, A Clockwork Orange and Dances  With Wolves. But is it better than Singin' In the Rain, It's A Wonderful  Life and Gone With the Wind? That question is for you to answer. However, I  personally believe that it is not. Nevertheless, I love the picture and  plan to see it at least ten times within three years. Looking forward to  part II and III...	5.0	Not the best movie ever, but close.	1999-10-18	0	0	0

If that wasn't enough, he soon realizes that his whole life has been a dream and a lie.The Matrix is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with significant elements of science fiction.Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Lawrence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.Simply put, this movie has made History!  It has revolutionized cinema.  The concept, the setting, the SPECIAL EFFECTS, the music, and the battle scenes are all EXCELLENT!  The Matrix is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.

This movie is to the 1990's what Blade Runner was to the 1980's, 2001 to the 60's, Forbidden Planet to the 50's, etc.I doubt that I'll write anything that hasn't been written, but I did notice something last night that I hadn't noticed before, and that was the ""no rules"" mentioned in the narrative at the end.It struck me as ironic that the way Neo was able to survive and eventually triumph over The Matrix was by learning rules, lots of them.  Didn't he spend an entire day absorbing ""rules"" through all those programs that were downloaded into his brain?  He had to do this even though he was already predestined to be ""the one"".  He also had to practice and perfect the programming that was downloaded into him.Having a destiny didn't preclude him from having to learn a lot of rules, but Neo got to learn them painlessly while we in the ""real world"" have to learn things the hard way, buy studying or practicing something for years.But once we have mastered our subject or discipline, we have ""freedom"" that others do not: the freedom to make music, create art, build amazing computer applications, etc.So, whatever The Matrix represents to you, you'll likely not overcome it simply through ""free your mind"" and ""no rules"", but rather by learning the ""rules"" that ""The Matrix"" has made for you and then learning and practicing the rules you need in order to defeat it, but that will likely take more than a day of sitting in a chair."	5.0	No rules, once you know the rules.	2007-03-28	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A1KMSB43RZ6RJ4	Lindsey	The Matrix was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It makes you open up your mind and think about reality and what lies beyond.  It makes you wonder if the world is really what you see it as, or maybe like the movie  suggests this world is a cover-up for something else.  The special effects  of the movie were beyond amazing.  The way they would freeze the picture,  then turn the view was incredible.  It made it seem like it really was in  some other time and some other world ans it helped support the fact that  they had no rules in their reality.  The way the characters moved, the  technology they used, everything in the movie made it more believable.  I  recommend seeing this movie if you have an open mind.

So, when everyone praised this movie and all of its special effects, I was skeptical. I have to  admit, though, the special effects blew me away from beginning to end, and  the plot was surprisingly good too. I first saw this movie on VHS and  immediately wanted it on DVD...the DVD definitely adds a lot of dimensions  that you can't get the full effect of on VHS.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2T7TZBOTP68C7	"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart"""	The Star Wars Prequels sure were not the movies to bring the wonderment of sci-fi to a new generation.  But one mysteriously unrecognized (by the Academy) film is.  Keanu Reeves is Neo, who leads a cast of characters with equally cool names on a quest to set people free from the Matrix, a virtual reality that is: our reality.  This Matrix is set up by machines to keep humans happy while we are used as fuel cells for the vast world of the Machines.This is a movie to watch over and over, as there is such an original and thought-provoking (if not mind-boggling) script.  What makes this movie so unusual is that is is both highly intellectual and action-packed.  With the Matrix, movie-making, as well as culture, have moved up a notch.  Nothing will ever be the same after these movies.	5.0	Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi for a New Generation	2004-06-26	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A36BTMM0XZC4WY	Lonnie Clark	Story is hard to follow...nihilistic viewpoint. I know I'm supposed to think its great, for me, its just more posturing and grooming to accept the destruction of our ecology by an elite few.  This movie really got on my last nerve.  I watched it all because my friend thought it was great.  For me, it is a pathetic attempt to make us accept a future of destruction and not that interesting.	2.0	Much Ado About Nothing (or not feeling it).	2014-02-24	3	0	3

The plot no longer seems relevant, there are a ton of plot holes, and this movie stars Keanu Reeves. All the other actors are pretty good, and the agents are a highlight.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2F9PJ8S0GSC7N	Lorenzo Hernandez	You'd think THE MATRIX was a very special movie indeed based on all the extremely positive comments preceding this one. I must admit that it is quite entertaining and has no boring moments. It features some great special effects and is visually exciting. But these adjectives could also be used to describe an MTV music video. In fact, it seems music videos, along with Japanese animation and the slow motion action scenes from John Woo movies, were the main inspiration for this film. Throw in a science fiction plot containing lots of pseudo scientific jargon and you have a movie that is not only action packed but seems quite intellectual as well. But it is this intellectual aspect of THE MATRIX that I feel has been overrated. The film's central question, -- `Just what is reality?' is drowned out by all the action and not examined in any great detail. A motion picture that tackles this very same question in a much more fascinating manner is 1998's highly underrated DARK CITY. Both films explore similar territory, but because DARK CITY was not geared towards the mainstream by incorporating a modern music score and a shoot-em-up sensibility, it was not as popular. Like little children fascinated by bright colors and loud noises, modern audiences tend to be transfixed by films like THE MATRIX. But this movie's lasting power (like last months number one pop hit) won't be long term. Entertaining - yes, great or meaningful - No.	3.0	It's visual appeal far outweighs it's intellectual appeal.	2002-11-22	25	11	14

0790745399	The Matrix	AEYLFJDEWHHR8	Louis Underwood	To be brief, &quot;the Matrix&quot; is, at best, an &quot;OK&quot; action film with intellectual pretentions that come off sort of goofy-cyber-juvenile.  Still, it is alot of fun to look at (until you  realize the whole thing looks like a Playstation version of a Gap  commercial).  Keanu Reeves is at his &quot;pretending not to be a complete  stoner moron&quot; best and Mr. Fishburne looks very pleased to be making  so much money for such little acting effort.  The real star (human wise) is  the character of Trinity who is absolutely stunning to look at and has some  of the best martial arts moves.  But even the tough as nails Trinity  couldn't save me from feeling this film was basically a B-grade flick on a  A-grade budget.  Worse of all, it takes itself so deadpan serious that I  couldn't help but laugh through most of it. Still, if your looking for some  mindless techno-dystopic fun, see the film.  If you want something in the  same vein with a little more substance, try &quot;Blade Runner&quot; or  &quot;Cube&quot; or the animated films &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; or  &quot;Akira&quot;.	3.0	An fun action movie, but highly overated	2000-03-28	15	6	9

0790745399	The Matrix	A22RY8N8CNDF3A	"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist"""	"""The Matrix"" is a science fiction tale made in 1999.  It is a very popular movie among young as they encounter the riddles, myths, and quest of finding truth and the meaning of life.Thomas Anderson (also known as Neo) is a young, handsome bachelor, living an ordinary life  He is T Anderson by day, a software techie in a bland office cubicle.  By night he is a computer hacker, always alone, feeling he is missing something.  He waits by his home computer at night, waiting for a message, a sign of some sort.  He does not know what he yearns to know.  One night he is told to ""follow the rabbit"" - like Alice in Wonderland.  He does not know what it means until some friends come to his door.  He sees a rabbit tattoo on a girl's arm and follows them to a party.  A mysterious woman named Trinity seeks him out at the party and introduces him to a deep voiced, handsome, dark man named Morpheus.  Morpheus sees Neo as special, the one he has been seeking, and shows him the truth about the world.Many dark secrets are exposed as the adventure begins.  Like ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" welcome to "" The Matrix"", a fictional universe, full of eclectic settings, electrical pulses and charges,  references to Eastern philosophy, religion, and characters that know the Matrix is not real, it is artificial reality they can manipulate with their minds.Imagination and special effects define the movie.  Laurence Fishburne aptly plays Morpheus, and Carrie-Anne Moss is a thrilling Trinity.  ""The Matrix"" morphs into surreal science fiction and then hits ""earth"" again with surprises big and small.Overall, ""The Matrix""  reminds me somewhat of the dream movie ""Inception"" made in 2010.  It is a fantastic mind controlled escape movie, and the special effects  define it."	2.0	Special Effects Define It, Plot Cloudy at Best	2010-09-22	7	2	5

0790745399	The Matrix	A2XVRCU5DQBULH	"L. Varnau ""nerff20"""	"Up until this movie's release, there wasn't much to say for cyberpunk movies. Films like ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" ""The Lawnmower Man,"" ""Hackers,"" and ""Menno's Mind"" had all ventured into this subgenre of science-fiction, but none had really delved far enough into the realm and most left a disappointing after-effect. Enter the Wachowski Brothers, two talented filmmakers with a love for cyberpunk and kung-fu movies as well as philosophy and romantic themes. They got cyberpunk veteran Keanu Reeves as their main character and found a terrific supporting cast in Joe Pantoliano, Lawrence Fishburne, Cary-Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving. Their story was a simple good-vs.-evil plot with the character Neo discovering that he is the one to bring balance to the force... er, I mean he is the one to save humanity. The plot had been seen before, but never like this. The Wachowskis combined stylized visuals with wild kung-fu and gunfights and molded a modern-day classic that has since spawned a new era in filmmaking where computers are as important as the camera. But ""The Matrix"" was more than just a revolutionary and visionary film, it was also a heckuva movie experience! Moviegoers flocked to this movie and were dumbfounded by the awesome action and quickly-moving storyline. Not only was the film a new step for moviemaking, it was also an incredibly good movie! The film recieved awards for its special-effects, but little was said about its plot or characters, something that is at the heart of this film. ""The Matrix"" is an excellent film and rates as one of the best in the past five years."	5.0	Supercool...	2002-10-02	1	1	0

0790745399	The Matrix	AZRJH4JFB59VC	Lynwood E. Hines	Back when The Matrix was released on DVD, it was THE DVD to own.  It is still very impressive, and simply a &quot;must have&quot; in any serious DVD collection.  The movie itself is a wonderful meshing of popular culture and religious themes, the acting is superb, and the action is thrilling.  As a computer professional, I am particularly drawn into this film, and can't help but love the way that this movie elevates a talented computer hacker to super-hero status.The special effects are ground breaking, to say the least.  But more importantly, these effects are used solely for the purpose of telling the story; they are not gratuitous in any way.  No effects are included that don't make sense within the context of the film.The matrix is one of a small class of films that successfully tells a story on many levels simultaniously.  Fight Club is another movie that pulls this off brilliantly.  For the first part of the film, you are not quite sure what is going on, or who to believe, or who to trust.  The characters are enigmatic and larger-than-life.  Once the secret is revealed (what &quot;the matrix&quot; is and it's implications), the previously enigmatic characters are developed more fully, and the main character (Neo) begins to grow and change.  His life and purpose from then on closely parallels that of Christ, including the fact that, in order to reach his full potential, he must die and be resurrected.If you have been living in a cave for the last two years and have not seen this film, I strongly recommend that you at least rent it and decide for yourself if it speaks to you.  But watch it several times before making up your mind, so you can fully appreciate all of the layers and aspects of the story.Movie: Story -&gt; A, Action -&gt; A+, Effects -&gt; A+DVD:  Transfer quality -&gt; A+, Extras -&gt; A, Feature utilization: A+	5.0	The Matrix set the standard	2001-02-01	1	0	1

It has an interesting plot, great special effects, and some incredible action sequences.  But despite all these, it isn't  &quot;perfect&quot; as many people have claimed and also isn't better than  the latest Star Wars film(in fact it has many similiar problems).The  actors are a mixed bag.  Laurence Fishburne does an excellent job as  Morpheus and helps set the tone for the entire film.  Keuno Reeves does a  decent job as do villians of the film.  The real problem is Trinity who is  a very one-dimensional character.  She is ment to be a strong female lead  but ends up just being boring.Another problem is that the fight  sequences are way over done.  I LOVE martial arts films but the fights look  so cheesy that they are funny at times.  I know they wanted to make them  look realistic but sometimes more is less(Jackie Chan looks subtle in  coparison).The story is very interesting but it has a one small problem  to it.  Without ruin anything for you despite everything the characters do  in the film it seems like they are doomed from the start.Even with these  problems however the Matrix turns out to be one of the best Sci Fi films  available and should not be missed.	4.0	Good but could be better	2000-03-30	10	1	9

0790745399	The Matrix	A199LEXKOL8PJ7	Marcus Gardner	The Matrix is too good for a rating. If I had to give The Matrix a rating it would be the best possible.I watched The Matrix a few days ago and the story line was so fascinating it has been on my mind ever sence.In  the movie Neo (Keanu Reeves) asks Morphius (Laurence Fishburne) &quot;What  is The Matrix?&quot;. And Morphius said that The Matrix is not something  you can put into words. And that he would have to see it for himself to  know what it is.That is how the movie is too.There is something I  can't explain about the movie The Matrix that is mind boggling.There is  not and never will be a better movie.	5.0	There will never be a better movie.	2000-03-23	14	7	7
0790745399	The Matrix	A1RDNTFV0B7K2S	Marcus	When I first saw The Matrix I didn't understand much of it. OK I thought, good action, breathtaking effects and nicely coreographed fighting-scenes, I assumed that was the whole point; the looks. Then I watched it again and realized that there was a deeper message beneath the surface, a message that can't be fully understood without experiencing it yourself. I've seen it more times than I can count and everytime I watch it something new appears. The Wachowski brothers have obviously put a lot of work into this one. The Matrix is that kind of movie that can make everyone satisfied as it has so much to offer; Action, Sci/Fi, martial arts, filosophy among other things, the combination is brilliant! When seeing other movies I've almost always had something to complain about, too much talking, too much fighting, no message and so on, but when it comes to The Matrix I can't complain. Simply put, this is the best film I've ever seen and it will probably stay in that position for years. You might be confused watching it the first time but I can assure you that you will watch it over and over again. Don't miss the opportunity to see a real masterpiece!	5.0	Buy it, see it, enjoy it, think about it.	2000-12-06	1	0	1

"I just purchased the newly-in-a- keepcase (not a snapper)edition which has  2008 on the back cover fine print (Amazon says 2007)I had held out because I had heard rave reviews of the remaster for the box set back in 2003-which you could only buy in the set at the time . I already had the 1999 disc-so I could waitSo, 5 years later a new package, with new package design work, current year copyright,-and WHV sitting on a nice RM for  a few years I thought ""Aha! Now  is the time to get it it!""=thinking that after all the years they would ditch the 1999 transfer.I watched the movie and thought, hmmmmmmmm nothing here that outstanding-almost looks like the old disc.So I put my disc into my iMac, opened it on the desktop-nothing!I use this trick to determine when a discs is remastered.They can press the disc for 5 years but the transfer date is the constant on file creation.WTF? I open to a blank page! no TS_AUDIO, no TS_VIDEO  no .VOB files nothing-these would show dates of creation on them, so one can tell the last time a disc was remastered.My long used trick didnt work.Then I get the idea to do a 'right click' to 'get info' from the menuLets party like it was 1999!  August 2-to be exact. Seems like they were hiding something?an 8 year old transfer  in a 2008 box......""File creation date-Aug 2, 1999"" hmmmmmm is it just me?I also notice on the inner ring, a different catalog number-and MADE IN CANADA printed on the plastic)Curiously, nowhere on the label is a visible  date or place of manufacture-which I thought to be law.And the box has the 2008 date onlyMisspackaging? They should destroy back stock, or stop printinng them-not reship it at this late date as if 'new'I dont think the marketseller will refund me-""Whaaaa! I got the 1999 pressing I want my money back""-he couldnt knowThis has me pi**ed because they have been sitting on a remaster for several years-and it should have been made available as a single disc by now- I didnt want the whole box-back then, or nowAfter all, it would not be two far out of reason to expect it with  new box/design change, that they would use the new transfer,no?With an economic meltdown happening right before our eyes-$175 Trillion in bailouts (total so far), consumer spending dropping like a stone,- and the deficits-we sit in a trance and allow thisI would not offend the still very large S-DVD market which is still 90% of your revenue-BR can never quite keep a continual average of 10% in monthly sales (source: videoscan/endgadget-industry gerbils- for past 6 months ZD Net-a popular widely read IT i-zine' -say 5% 0f the market)-and now you can bet that will drop with the economy.a 10% sales drop in DVD sales could be absorbed-a 10% in BR would finish it offSales of players are slow now and will be dead in Jan-you can see the writing on the wall-""BUY ANY 1 BR title AND GET 3 FREE!!

0790745399	The Matrix	A2J1UWQ6D6DHA5	Mark Edelstein	This 1999 movie, the Matrix, would be in the top two of my favorite movies.  The special effects were great for example a time when Neo, the main character is shot by 5 bullets.  He sticks out a hand and the bullets  drop.  The actors and actresses were also great.  Its hard to imagine The  Matrix II will be better than the Matrix I. As a matter of fact its hard to  imagine any movie being better than this.  The main plot is about people in  a dream world of the truth while the people like us do not believe our  dreams are nothing but our thoughts.  You really start to believe in your  dreams like they our real.  This movie is given the &quot;R&quot; rating.  When you watch this movie you will think in should have been rated PG-13.  I truely believe it was right to have the R rating.  This is because the  movie is extremely hard to understand.  My 7 year old brother saw half of  this movie.  He loved the effects but did not understand the plot at all.  The ages for this movie I would say is mature 8 year olds and up.

0790745399	The Matrix	A11A8GWG0IXBZH	"Mark Hills ""Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!"""	"The Matrix...ahh, the Matrix is to cyberpunk what Mortal Kombat was to the martial arts genre-pablum. Yes, it did have completely awesome special effects, but as we have seen time and again, special effects do not a good movie make. Unfortunately, this appears to be all that is good about this  film that makes William Gibson's `Neuromancer' look the finest of  Shakespear's sonnets. It entertains, sure, but then again, so do a lot of  N-64 games, as long as you don't think about it too hard. Keanu Reeves does  not deserve to appear in the same scenes with the likes of Lawrence  Fishburne-who single handedly steals every one they share together.Okay, Mark, you've complained a whole lot so far, but haven't said what the  Matrix is actually about. Okay, the Matrix is about this guy named Neo  (Reeves) who has a McJob that he hates, but when he goes home at the end of  the day, he becomes a cyber-guy and logs into America On-Line or something  where he can abandon his life of quiet desperation. He also notices that  the world sometimes isn't what it looks like, (and what it looks like is  Quake, because everything is olive green and grey). He meets Trinity  (Carrie-Anne Moss), who basically looks like she's undead in leather, and  she wants to show him a whole new world, but first must get Neo past the  sinister Agents, the leader of which played Tick in `Priscilla-Queen of the  Desert'.After `escaping' Neo wakes up in a black pod covered in  strawberry jam with dozens of tubes feeding into his body out of something  that resembles H.R. Geigar Lite. He also finds that there are millions upon  millions of McPods just like his. Now we meet Morpheus (Fishburne), who  out-cools Reeves at every turn, and we learn that there is a band of rebels  who have escaped the Matrix-a massive immersive virtual reality system that  all of humanity has been trapped in by evil robots that we created, (Geez,  you'd think we would have learned not to do things like that after the  Terminator thing). Now it gets dumb (er, dumber).The Robots and the  artificial intelligence that runs the planet are harvesting humans for heat  so that they may continue...doing what, we're never told, but keeping  humanity under wraps seems to be all they do. Now, Morpheus is convinced that Neo  is the Chosen One, a cyber-messiah who has come to save all of the  oblivious humans trapped in the Matrix. Forgetting of course that, if they  win, they have to clothe, house and feed billions of humans who might be  better off inside their pods. Morpheus trains Neo how to fight, thanks to a  healthy dose of plug-in skill chips that instantly teach martial arts and  weapons skills to anyone. The worst part about the  film is the betrayal. In much the same way as the Secret Service agent who  sold out the President in `Airforce One' made no sense, the betrayal in the  Matrix leaves the viewer going `Huh!  Where did that come from! "" Because  in order to enter the Matrix, one must be supervised and plugged in-things  that can't be done on one's own. He will sell out Morpheus so that he may be  plugged back into the Matrix-all because he's tired of living on the crummy  submarine and eating reonstituted slop.The Matrix is slick, and it  does have its moments, but the story leaves a great deal to be desired. I  would like to say the action is fast paced, but it isn't because every  action scene is shot in slow motion-from NRA gun nut romp through the lobby  of an office tower where the Agents are hold Morpheus to the end sequences  within the subway, the break neck action scenes seem to last forever, and  it gets tedious. It is cookie-cutter entertainment in much the same way  that `Independence Day' was-it's great as long as you don't think about it  too hard. Of the three blockbuster movies of 1999-The Phantom Menace, The  Matrix, and The Mummy, The Mummy is the best pick of the bunch. If you want  to discover good cyberpunk, read Neuromancer or Islands in the Net."	3.0	Cyberpunk-Lite (Less Thrilling and Half the Plot)	2000-05-01	5	2	3

0790745399	The Matrix	A3J510E9W1CJ1K	mashby	The movie that started it all. The Matrix came completely out of the blue. No one had ever heard of the directors, the Wachowski brothers. Their only other movie directorial effort was Bound, which no one ever saw. (Turns out, Bound was simply an audition to prove to the studios that they knew how to direct and could handle the project that was The Matrix). The actors were a mixed bag of good actors (Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano), bad actors (Keanu Reeves) and then unknown actors (Carrie-Ann Moss and Hugo Weaving). The previews gave nothing away. You were simply left with the question &#65533;What Is The Matrix?&#65533; and a few images of some very cool action. The only thing I knew at the time was that I HAD to go see the movie the night it was released.Before I go any further, I need to make a confession. I am the target demographic for this movie. As such, my opinion of this movie is biased from the word go. I love video games, I like kung fu, I like science fiction, I like comic books, and I like technology. The one overwhelming mantra of The Matrix is that the Wachowski brothers use everything, pop culture, religion, video games, you name it and blend it all together to make something new. Since they used all the things that I like already, the movie was a wicked cocktail that hooked me from the instant I tasted it. I loved the story, the action, the cinematography, even the acting.Fishburne and Joey Pants are great character actors and I tend to love their work regardless of the film their in. Keanu Reeves is a different story. Other than the Bill & Ted movies, Keanu&#65533;s acting hasn&#65533;t been all that good. Johnny Mnemonic was a bomb in no small part thanks to Keanu&#65533;s lack of skill as an actor. He&#65533;s stiff, doesn&#65533;t convey a lot of emotion and his delivery is stilted. His main redeeming quality is that he looks good. All his negatives became positives in the Wachowski&#65533;s hands. The character of Neo is one where you need someone stiff and emotionless, but looks good as he&#65533;s kicking ....... Keanu more than fits the bill. This was the role he was meant to play.The story was good, but the storytelling was the hallmark for me. For many people the cinematography was all new to them. Some people had never seen camera angles like they found in the Matrix, but I had in comic books and in Japanese Animation aka anime. In comic books, the method of storytelling is done through still images. Although that may sound somewhat stilted, it can actually give some freedom because each frame and show you more detail, slow things down, or speed things up. If anything it gives you a wide latitude with perspective. Anime takes a similar approach because much of anime is done on such a small budget. For example, one trick that anime uses is to take a still image and have the &#65533;camera&#65533; move from left to right. This gives the impression of movement, but it&#65533;s really just a single still image. These tricks created an entire style that anime still uses today even though the budget may be bigger.The Wachowski&#65533;s came from a comic book background, and one of the things that they were trying to do was bring some of the storytelling style from comic books and anime to the silver screen. Trinity&#65533;s jump, bullet time, and the fight between Neo and Agent Smith in the subway are all examples of 2d comic book and Japanese anime style that was realized in film. Motion pictures, comic books and animation are all simply mediums to tell a story. The Wachowski brothers blended the styles and blurred the lines between the mediums.The techniques that the director&#65533;s used in the Matrix changed film as we know it. Hardly any action movie today doesn&#65533;t use kung fu wire work. Charlie&#65533;s Angels, The Rundown, and even Le Pacte des Loups all used the fighting style made popular in The Matrix. Star Wars may have been a landmark movie because it changed how science fiction was done, but The Matrix did that and more. The ripple effect of this movie has left it&#65533;s mark on so many filmakers that it&#65533;s hard to watch any action or science fiction film and not see touches of The Matrix in them.In 1999 the Wachowski brothers released a landmark film that changed film, and to some extent our culture, forever. It came out of the blue and blew us all away. It would be four years before their story could continue, but it was all worth the wait.	5.0	The movie that started it all.	2004-02-27	2	1	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A2I21HA7UHTWPL	"""matrix_com1"""	The Matrix is one of the few movies that I enjoy watching over and over. Each time I view it, I discover something new in the story or scenes. It has a rare and interesting plot, and it appeals to the imagination, emotions and intellect. In this age of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, &quot;e&quot;-everything and cyber-everything, the theme of the movie is a relevant piece of work. A friend of mine said that he does not like the movie because it is &quot;unrealistic&quot; and far-fetched. Well, to those who feel this way, I would like to say that it is, after all, a science-fiction movie, not a science documentary. As a sci-fi movie, it has to go beyond what we normally regard as &quot;realistic&quot; , and The Matrix certainly stretches way beyond those boundaries.This is also one movie which is even the more interesting and mind-blowing when followed with other on-line resources or web information, such as the numerous uncanny Biblical parallels and symbolisms (such as Neo readily sacrificing himself to save humankind from the deception and bondage of a malevolent force, then coming back alive to defeat his foes), as well as analysis of some of the characters and their names.I first watched the movie simply for &quot;eyes-lolly&quot; Keanu as Thomas Anderson, but as I watched the video again, I find the other characters growing on me too, such as Trinity, Morpheus, Tank, and yes! even the 3 agents Smith, Jones and Brown, esp. Agent Smith. All in all, it is a great movie with a good cast, cool, stylish stunts and special effects.	5.0	More than cyber-thrills and spills	2001-06-20	3	2	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	The Matrix is a stunning sci-fi thriller from the remarkable Wachowski brothers, who CO-wrote and CO-directed it. With just a couple of small independent films under their belts, the Wachowskis were somehow able to propel themselves into the front line of big budget film making. So skittish was the management team at Warner Brothers over the project that it opted to take on an Australian finical partner. Making The Matrix in Australia further lowered Warner's risk. Now that the film is a worldwide smash hit, the company must split the profits and the credit. Welcome to the New Hollywood, a place run by business types who make decisions based not on gut instinct, but on a wealth of computer data. Ironically, The Matrix is about the fate of a world that carries its reliance on computers too far.The movie opens in the year 1999. Or is it 1999 at all? We find Tom Anderson living two lives. By day he is an employee at a powerful software company. By night he is a computer hacker known as Neo. Without giving the plot away, I can say that all his life, Anderson has felt that the world is somehow vaguely askew. In his secret life on the Internet, he has become obsessed with a man know only as Morpheus, who is wanted by the authorities for computer sabotage. One night he is lead to a disco where he meets a strange and beautiful girl called Trinity. She is also a hacker and can arrange for him to meet Morpheus. The plot then gets very thick indeed.In another irony, I have never seen a film that integrates computer graphics and effects into the story as well as The Matrix does. The subject matter demands a heavy reliance on special effects. In fact, prior to the introduction of digital technology, such a movie would have been extremely difficult to make. Its theme and tone are much like another sci-fi classic, Blade Runner, but that earlier movie did not have to bend the rules of space and time in the ways The Matrix does.Despite all it technical wizardry, The Matrix's driving force is its riveting thriller of a story. Glorious special effects, for once, enhance the memorable characters. The theme may owe its origins to the best of the comic books, but this does not detract from it, any more than it did from the first Superman and Batman movies.Keanu Reeves is excellent as Neo. It's not the kind of performance that wins an Oscar. It's the kind one remembers long after one forgets who won the Oscar. Like the late Cary Grant, Reeves is more star and personality than actor. Grant played Grant better than anyone else, and only Reeves can play Reeves. Laurence Fishburne gives his usual strong yet thoughtful performance in the role of Morpheus. Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity with both relish and style.The Matrix is a big, splashy show, and it is less spectacular on video than it was on the big screen. Still, most of the big events play reasonable well when shrunk down, and the story itself is perhaps a bit enhanced on video.Both a thrill ride and a thought provoking look at mankind's tenuous relationship with reality, The Matrix is unlike any movie you are likely to see this year. In fact, I haven't admired a high profile sci-fi thriller this much since Alien, Aliens and Blade Runner in the early 1980s.	5.0	On my Top Ten List for 1998	2002-03-22	2	0	2

Because of its subject matter and technical prowess, it is a DVD that is made for the new digital age of video players.First off, it's a great flick: a live-action comic book (which you'll comprehend once you view the behind the scenes extras -- the storyboards for this film were done by talented comic artists. The frames of the movie replicate these strips. Brilliant!)The DVD looks great.  I recently watched it on one of those excellent plasma screens and realized for the first time that all of the scenes that take place in the ""matrix"" have a green tint to them - to suggest the unrealness of the matrix.The story continues to enthrall me every time I watch it.  The Wachowski brothers are great story tellers and THE MATRIX is a great story.  They interpolate references to Jesus and Alice in Wonderland.And Hugo Weaving's performance as Agent Smith is hilarious and nuanced at the same time.The DVD has some great bonus stuff. The feature on ""Bullet Time"" is fascinating. You'll understand how they achieved the famous shot of Keanu on the roof in his black jacket dodging bullets!THE MATRIX is 3 years old as of this writing.  In 2003, the first sequel will be out.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3BD9K3Z8QLZP9	Matt Hudnall	"As you watch films like The Matrix you can begin to see many thematic elements hatched from previous stories.  Like many movies The Matrix was put together using other pieces of literature.  Three noticeable story comparisons are present in The Matrix.  Alice in Wonderland is referred to directly in the movie as ""Neo"", the character played by Keanu Reeves is led into a new, world that is unknown to him.  The story in The Matrix is actually tied closer to an ancient piece of philosophical literature.  The Allegory of the Cave by Plato is a perfect match with the design for the ""Matrix.""  The basis of The Allegory of the Cave is that man inside the cave believes all that he sees inside the cave is real.  It is only until man discovers that he has been confined that he realizes the truth one step at a time.  The things that he sees are shadows or variations of reality.  Man sees what is making these illusions and then recognizes what the real world is.  In the ""Matrix"" the people live out their normal lives thinking everything is real that they see.  In reality the people are barely alive and are lead into a false life by A.I.  Their minds' are programmed to believe that they live a normal life while in actuality they are trapped in a world controlled by machines.  The Matrix seems basically to be a modernized version of this classic piece of philosophical genius.In comparison, the fantasy world created by the computers represents the cave.  The cave is more detailed and modernized in this wonderful piece of Sci-Fi art.  When watching the movie the transitions between the ""Matrix"" and the real world are so drastic that we, the audience are left in utter and complete amazement of the outcome.  The Wakowski Brothers have ingeniously taken this wonderful philosophical story and rejuvenated it.  Even though The Allegory of the Cave only gives The Matrix a setting and outline with room for growth it still plays a major role in the movie.The audience begins to see evidence of the ""Matrix's"" unreality, as the movie uses visual and audible clues that give the knowledge that the world ""Neo"" lives in is in fact falsely generated.  As ""Neo"" answers his call from ""Morpheus"", played by Laurence Fishburne, you can hear a sort of computer static in the ring of the phone.  Then as the wind blows the phone from his grasp on the side of skyscraper, the phone visually slows down and resumes its descent at a regular pace.This eye candy is used throughout the entire movie.  Things are depicted in slow motion to the viewer to symbolize that they are moving with incredible quickness.  This quickness is only shown by people who are aware of the ""Matrix"" and the rules of the ""Matrix"".  The ""Matrix"" being a computer generated world has its rules, but like most computer programs these rules can be bent or even broken.  All that is needed is the open mind and knowledge that the impossible is possible.The Matrix uses much philosophy in its structure as a movie.  Many of the ideas in the movies were taken directly from the thoughts of philosophers.  For example, ""Morpheus"" explains that when you die in the ""Matrix"" you die in the real world.  This is because the ""Matrix"" stimulates your mind to make you believe everything is real.  If you die in the ""Matrix"" your mind dies, and your body cannot exist without your mind.  This argument was made by the famous philosopher Descartes, who believes that a person is made up of two separate parts; one part body and one part mind.I highly recommend watching The Matrix as it not only dazzles the mind with its special effects, but it expands ones mind with new enlightened thoughts.  I cannot imagine a better way of showing the work of Plato to the modern world. The acting is amazingly surprising as Keanu Reeves gives his best performance in this milestone of philosophical theater art."	5.0	&#65533;The Matrix: A Movie Spawned by Philosophical Excellence&#65533;	2001-11-02	3	1	2

0790745399	The Matrix	A1LJLRAXX5ICQ5	Max	I bought this movie a while ago after hearing raves about it. But only last weekend did I get a chance to sit down and watch it in our well  equipped Home Theater. In an era where Jessie Ventura gets to run and win  an election, it is not surprising that movies of this type succeed. In  fact, I predict as the younger generation, with substantial exposure to  video game and TV depiction of gory and extreme violence, grows up - we  will find more and more such movies being favorably reviewed and possibly  even win Oscars ! The movie has great surround and special effects. But the  shocking amount of violence with no regard for life, while nothing unusual  for the teenage crowd, shocks me. I am a 37 year father of a four year old.  Dont get me wrong, I do enjoy special effect and surround sound, but the  violence has to make sense. Ok maybe thats asking too much in this day and  age.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2FQW5UF3ZABYR	"M. Baugh ""pulpreader"""	The Matrix is a movie of dazzling special effects and equally high concepts.  Unlike many recent action movies it delves deep into themes of truth and illusion, meaning and power, good and evil and much more rather than skimming across their surface.  The premise is that a young everyman called Neo discovers that the world he knows is nothing more than an illusion designed to keep humans ignorant of the dark powers that enslave them.  Neo must open his eyes to the unpleasant realities of life, confront the dark forces and find a way to awaken everyone else to reality as well.Strip away the high tech background and you find that this is a very old story, complete with miraculous deeds and healings, sacrificial love, and even resurrection.  Perhaps the greatest departure from Matrix's possible inspiration is that Jesus never said &quot;We need guns, lots of guns!&quot;Still, in the end, the outcome doesn't depend on guns, or kung fu, of any of the other forms of violence that abound here.  The creators of matrix use cinematic action to draw the audience in and to build excitement, but they are too wise to suggest that &quot;more guns&quot; is the way evil can ever be defeated.It works well as escapist action fare, but Matrix is actually much more.  Every scene is filled with hidden meanings, and the conclusion is a triumph.  It is well worth watching and think about!	4.0	Ancient themes in a futuristic light	2001-04-10	5	2	3
0790745399	The Matrix	A3ENN25NFADE1X	MBrian	"Morpheus Quotes: ""What is real, how do define real."" When you see the sequel, you'll realize what he means. Every action scene gets you thinking more about what Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) said to Neo (Keanu Reeves) than you thinking about the action. But who is Neo, How was he born, who was his so-called parents, in fact sense ""Matrix Reloaded"" explained that their all programs, what was the purpose of creating this powerful program called Neo.THE TRILOGYWhat was the point of making the sequels in the first place if you'r just going to have mindless action, bad acting, and terrible dialogue. Well lets think, if it wasn't for that scene with the architect, the saga would be truly ruined. The architect explains that their entire excistense is to be rewind in time. Every time Neo saves Zion, the machines recreate the entire story. The birth of Neo, the fight between Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), and the love between Trinity Carrie Ann-Moss and Neo. But what they didn't count on was the rogue program, called agent Smith. ""Reloaded"" is good cause we get new ideas that ""The Matrix"" didn't give us, and that is why I would of given this film 3 out of 4 stars. But when I saw the third installment, I said to myself, ""WHAT HAPPENED."" It was like the Wachowski's (Bound) just gave up on the whole franchise. They may have gotten sick of the whole saga itself.

People either get this movie, or dont get it.  I get it so much that sometimes I think the world really IS the matrix.Anyway, the way the story goes is that there's a hacker named Neo who starts to get messages on his computer telling him wierd stuff, which causes him to go to a club and He sees a lady hacker (known as Trinity) who tells him some stuff and about another hacker named Morpheus.  Anyway, Neo asks Morpheus his life long question, &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot;  He then learns about the Matrix being a fake world where everone is a slave.  The bad guys in the Matrix are AI's disguised as, get this, Feds!

0790745399	The Matrix	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	This movie is five years old now. It has spawned two sequels, and the Animatrix, and by the middle of 2002, the famous &quot;Bullet Time&quot; sequence had been spoofed in over 20 different movies. So to say the whole design of the movie is getting a little tedious now is an understatement now. The movie was revolutionary when it first started out, but now so many people have 'copied' the Wachowski brothers ideas, it's just not so great a film anymore. Well, the film is great, if very much about the talk rather than the action.Matrix Revolutions has just come out on DVD. After the Matrix, Reloaded and Revolutions had a lot to live up to, and got absolutely slated in the press. I've been reading reviews for the DVD of Revolutions, and some of them have been very misleading - particularly one, which said it had no DVD extras. A sure sign of a reviewer not being able to be bothered to check out their facts first, when in fact, it's a 2-disc set, with a lot of extras.Anyway, I just wanted to have a small rant about that :) before continuing. I have to rant to someone.There's a lot of hard work put into the filming of the Matrix, as you can see just by watching it. Before filming, the main actors spent time with martial arts experts learning the fight movies, from October 1997-March 1998. Funnily enough, the actors thought originally this would only take a few weeks! Carrie Anne Moss was so afraid that she would get recast when she twisted her ankle, that she kept it quiet, which must have been extemely difficult!There are many references that the Wachowski brothers have included in this, from comic books, to movies, to people! There are quite a few references to Alice In Wonderland; the traitor is called Reagan, and wants to become someone important and remember nothing when he leaves the Matrix, which could refer to former US President Ronald Reagan; when Neo is in the elevator to go and see the Oracle, he can see KYM carved into the wall, which refers to Kym Barrett, a costumer designer; and Neo's room number is 101 and Room 101 was the place in George Orwell's book &quot;1984&quot; where people were sent to be tortured and would end up believing something that wasn't true. (!)Apparently, principal photography wrapped at 1:01am with the scene where the characters are inside the wall, climbing down. Principal photography took 25 weeks/118 days.Before the Matrix, Keanu Reeves hadn't really had a major box office hit since maybe Speed in 1994. And there were a couple of good films inbetween that didn't get the recognition they deserved! :) But the Matrix trilogy has really propelled him to stardom, but no doubt, he'll leave it all behind now, and do some more 'bad' films.I suppose everyone will always say this is the best of the trilogy. But once you have the first, you have to get the rest just to complete the trilogy. It's ridiculous to have 2 out of 3, or 1 of 3. The bit I hate about the whole movie, is the use of guns. They're overly used, and overall, guns are way overused in movies these days. But that's just my opinion.	4.0	The 'magic' doesn't last.	2004-04-03	3	2	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A3OIY3NVWSF6PM	Mel P	One of the most compelling things about The Matrix is its biblical theme on Messianism, the belief that a particular hopeful saviour, who is usually derived from the outside world, comes and saves the world.The protagonist of this film is obviously Neo. Here, his name literally means `new,' as in a new concept or idea being formed. He resembles Jesus in being `the absolute One' that is able to perform miracles and in conflict with Thomas Anderson, the Satan in this movie.The Matrix demonstrates that the story of Jesus is still relevant in today's world. Although the real Satan may lack the black rimed sunglasses and sophisticated suit, this film is capable of showing us His miracles, teachings, and inevitable love for humanity.	4.0	Jesus in the Matrix	2006-05-21	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A39ARV0OY7ZDGG	Melting_Pot	This is one of my favorite sci-fi movies ever. Whel the Matrix Revolutions may be better than this, that does not mean that the original one is no good. In fact, I really go nuts over it. I like the story, too: a young software technician named Neo gets a visit from mysterious woman named Trinity who he embarks and an action journey with. Should have won fifteen Oscars.	5.0	Great Sci-Fi Adventure	2004-06-12	5	4	1
0790745399	The Matrix	AX1HJH3WE9V9I	melvin	"What is the Matrix? That's the question everyone's looking to answer in this sci-fi spectacular from Wachowski brothers. One thing it was -- groundbreaking both in the spectacular special effects that we've since taken for granted.Computer hacker extraordinaire Neo (Reeves) has this gut feeling that life isn't all that it seems to be. Turns out he's right in a big way. A group of revolutionaries led by the thought to be mythical Morpheus (Fisburne) open his eyes to the Matrix.The Matrix, it turns out, is nothing more than an elaborate computer generated reality intended to mollify humanity who are in reality nothing more than sheep or in this case a renewable energy source, to feed the machines that have inherited the Earth.Morpheus believes Neo is ""The One"", a prophesized savior who can bend the Matrix to his own will who will eventually lead humanity out of slavery."	4.0	matrix a movie a science	2002-12-20	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A2A0GWHE3T28MP	mepro1	"I am a big fan of this movie...unfortunately as the sequels came out it progressively went downhill, yet still enjoyable.  I was always amazed at what an original idea this was until I watched the Japanese anime film ""Ghost in the Shell"" from 1995 (the manga [jap. comic] came out in 1989?).  There are so many similarities taken from ""Ghost..."" even down to the fast trickling green code writing and the head connectors to ""plug in"" to the net.  Still a great movie though but not an original masterpiece that I thought.  Everyone should see ""Ghost in the Shell"".  Ghost # 2 is coming on DVD in December and I'm looking forward to it."	5.0	Great but not as original as I presumed	2004-11-14	3	0	3
0790745399	The Matrix	A16RUNHNMVXI76	Meridith Thomson	What's the deal with Keanu Reeves? I don't get it! I particually thought that the role of Neo should go to someone more inclined to act. But Keanu's less than stellar preformance is saved by the amazing concept and theme  (not to mention special effects) in and of this movie. It's great for  people who take movies in a literal sense and it's even better for people  who will try to analyize it in a metaphoric sense! If you think about it,  the movie DOES have some holes that can be punched, but it's one movie you  have to see over and over again to understand....with something new in it  every time!  You will be thinking about this movie, the meaning, the  concepts, and everything else included for days!  It's action packed and  meaningful all rolled up into one!

0790745399	The Matrix	AMG2LF8MLUDN1	M. Fields	"I must first admit that when I saw The Matrix for the first time I was unimpressed.  It didn't move me at all.  It wasn't until way after The Matrix Revolutions was released that I took a second look at it.  Maybe that's the hook.  If you didn't like it the first time, watch it again.  I got hooked.  The concept was so original that it blew me away.  I'm still not crazy about the casting of The Matrix execpt for the Neo, Morpheus, Smith and Trinity characters.  Casting for Reloaded and Revolutions is much improved.  The other thing that I'm not impressed with is the soundtrack.  In some places I find it annoying and lackluster.  Usually if I like a movie score enough I'll buy it but there is no danger of that here I'm sorry to say.  Still, you shouldn't let that deter you.Imagine that the world you thought you knew and the life you thought you had, were all lies and make believe.  Imagine artificial intelligence running amok and dominating the world. Imagine being ""jacked in"" and living your life amoungst the programs in a giant computer matrix.  Awesome concept.All of the sudden, almost everthing I thought I liked in sci-fi has been challenged.  Star Wars and Star Trek seem silly to me now.  As if I had been watching kiddie sci-fi all this time and now I've been shown sci-fi from an adult point of view.  No disrepect intended and don't get me wrong.  I still like those movies and they too were ground breaking in their day.This movie can be quite complex to follow as there are so many sub-plots and hidden messages throughout.  Some people become so confused between the real world and the matrix world that they give up on the movie and cast it aside.  Hence, many of the negative reviews.  The trick is to keep viewing it until it reveals itself to you bit by bit if necessary.  What is even more surprising is that The Matrix is basically and very loosely the story of Jesus from a sci-fi point of view.  This becomes more apparent as you view The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions.  If that shocks you, consider the following:  Neo is ""the one"" that has been prophesied to come and save what's left of the human race.  Note Neo's power to resurrect the dead when Trinity dies in ""Reloaded.""  The program called the creator represents God only if very loosely.  Morpheus represents John the Baptist as he is the one that continues to tell people the good news.  A savior is coming.  The Merovingian represents satan and even runs a club called hell in ""Revolutions.""  In the bible Zion is used sometimes to denote the Church of God (Hebrews 12:22), and sometimes the heavenly city (Revelation 14:1). Nebuchadnezzar (the name of Morpheus' ship) was the greatest and most powerful of all the Babylonian kings.  Trinity (as if I have to explain that) refers to the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost although that is not Carrie Moss' role in this film.  Cypher represents Judas for obvious reasons.  The list goes on and on.  Perhaps these reasons  are part of why everyone appears to be so deeply effected by this movie trilogy.Ground breaking special effects are also part of the equation.  Many of these scenes have never been seen or even thought of before.  There are so many new things to see here.  My review would go on for days if I tried to explain them here.  Don't feel left out while others discuss the theologies and philosophies of The Matrix.  Instead, watch it for what you can get out of it.  You may note something that everyone else missed.  There are many levels and we don't get all of them at the same time.While many find flaws and faults with The Matrix (what movie isn't flawed?) still others will walk away unimpressed as I did.  Mind you I haven't seen any of the Matrix films in the theater.  I do urge you to see it more than once.  Once the inital shock is over, the many levels contained therein will start to seep into your brain.  Pretty soon instead of saying Huh? what? you say Ahah!! I get it.  So that's what that means.The Matrix Trilogy has ushered in a new era of sci-fi just as Star Wars did back in the day.  It seems like a million years ago.  We will never be the same!!  We may never be satisfied with the same old thing again.  The sci-fi world is forever changed now.I must add my kudos to the main cast.  They all did some amazing stunt work and really pushed themselves physically and mentally to learn all of the martial arts moves and other dazzling feats.  You can see how hard they trained when you watch the special features on each dvd.  Yes there are a lot of CGI scenes but the actors are underneath most of it providing the movement for the camera to capture.  Great work.Parental advisory:  There is violence in this movie.  There is a small amount of nudity (non-frontal) but there is foul language and unfortunately the Lord's name is taken in vain.  I would advise a viewing age of at least 16 because the plots are so demanding that a younger mind may not grasp the details.THIS TRILOGY ROCKS!"	5.0	What a concept!	2005-01-07	4	3	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A3GPT1UQ3PB6I3	M. Gray	I fought seeing this movie when it came out(even though everyone I knew said it was great)because I thought that Reeves could not act well enough to hold the lead in a movie. Well, I was wrong.Keanu finally tries a  little acting, and although not oscar caliber,he's still good. Aside from  Keanu not destroying the film, come the obvious praise. The special effects  are spectacular. They could make this movie worth seeing just for them.  The action scenes that house these special effects are fantastic as well.  The supporting cast of L.Fishburne(who is always great!)and the rest of the  crew adds another jewel to this crown.It is, however, the story that  really draws you in and makes you wonder. It is well thought out and  developed, which is rare for an action movie, and it is that story which  makes The Matrix a highly recommended film.	4.0	An Unexpectedly Excellent Movie	2000-05-29	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	A stunning blend of action and science fiction, &quot;The Matrix&quot; tells the tale of a computer programmer who stumbles into an alternate world that forever changes his perception of reality. There's a reason why &quot;The Matrix&quot; won a pile of awards (and made a pile of money at the box office). A masterpiece of technical wizardry and storytelling skill, this is one of those memorable films that succeeds on every one of its many ambitious levels.Fans and critics have raved about the film's mind-blowing special effects and fight scenes, but they are only part of the film's excellence. The superb performances of the actors are equally important. Particularly noteworthy is Laurence Fishburne's as Morpheus--his is a performance of controlled but passionate intensity. And Carrie-Anne Moss' performance as Trinity brings to the film a tenderness and humanity which greatly complement the high-tech milieu.&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a wonderfully literate film whose dialogue includes references from Greek mythology, the Bible, Christian theology, and English literature. And one of the central themes of the film--the defiant resistance to an enslaving force--is one that can be found in many of the world's great works of literature. Watch &quot;The Matrix,&quot; and then read the 1845 classic &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave&quot;--you'll appreciate the film even more.	5.0	A dynamic and intelligent triumph	2000-11-04	19	15	4

Everything about it was so novel that it changed the way action moviemakers thought about making their movies.THE MATRIX is just the perfect movie. It has a great stroyline, great philosophy behind the story, and great action scenes. It is, therefore, expected to satisfy a wide range of people with different tastes.I watched this movie many years ago and I consider it to be a great catalyst of my intellectual development. It is a movie that makes you think about the nature of the world, reality, metaphysics and much more. It is a movie that makes you question almost everything in life. It does that without getting you bogged down in the details, but instead, it does it while providing a kind of kung fu that you've never seen before!	5.0	One of the best movies ever made!	2006-01-26	1	1	0

Oh, wait a minute, there IS no spoon.  Maybe if this film gave itself an injection of self-mockery, it would have  been worth the time, but alas... For those who hated this film, see  &quot;Fight Club,&quot; and I promise, you will not be disappointed. It is  sort of the thinking man's &quot;Matrix,&quot; at least as far as style is  concerned.

It is truly a visionary film that mixes real human drama about self and the meaning of life into a slick science fiction piece that is truly approachable by sci-fi and non sci-fi fans alike. The DVD package, however, could have stood some more extra features, besides the few behind the scenes shorts that came with it. A piece about some of the philosophy behind some of the things that happen in the movies, or the names used, would have been nice. The picture is clear on the DVD, the sound is good, and the transfer is top notch. All that stops me from giving it a 5-star rating is the lack of extras.	4.0	Could use more extras	2003-06-27	2	1	1

There are plenty of other movies out there that have great effects without the horrible cast (excluding whats her name). Secondly, people often brag about the excellence of plot. WRONG! The plot is full of riduculous holes that make me wonder what people are smoking. I know that as a whole, people are dumb and individually they are smart. DON'T LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE ON THIS ONE! Make up your own mind!!!! I do think that this movie is ok, but the fact that constant delays have held up any sequel (lack of any feasible plot namely)will show it to be less of a profound or incredible movie than people think. LASTLY, THIS MOVIE IS NOT PROFOUND IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD!!!!!!!! The message that we live in some sort of &quot;Matrix&quot; has been done in different but similar forms (i.e. 1984 &quot;Big brother is watching you&quot;) anyway, the point of my argument is to MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND!

Keanu Reeves is one of the main characters and does a great job in this movie. He leads a double life of being a computer programmer and master hacker, but finally finds his true lot in life when he finds out he is in control of not only his future, but the &quot;matrix&quot;, which controls humanity. This movie relates to a higher power and that everything has to be controlled by someone to make the world a livable place to be in.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; at times may seem to be a very serious movie, but there are times when it is funny too. I would recommend this movie to adults, because for younger childeren they might not get the plot and follow the movie as easily as older people do.

0790745399	The Matrix	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	Let's imagine that you are an average Joe just trying to make your way through the world, doing whatever you can just to make a living. But just like that, your entire world is turned upside-down. That is what happens to a man in the sci-fi action thriller, The Matrix.  When The Matrix was released into theaters over the Easter weekend in 1999, it looked to another innocent film that might make some decent money since it had a relatively low budget. Who would have figured that this film would become a cultural phenomenon? It became one of the biggest DVDs of all time in 1999 and spawned two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, both set for release in 2003. Animated prequels, titled The Animatrix, have also been created based on the success of the original film. Obviously many are surprised at the success of the series but is the original as great as many claim it is or is all the praise just a lie?The story goes that Thomas Anderson is another run of the mill guy. He works in an office building during the day but outside his usual job, he sells computer programs and such in his spare time. His world is soon turned upside-down when he meets up with a woman named Trinity. He is seeking the answer to the same question she has: What is the Matrix? Mr. Anderson meets up with a strange man named Morpheus, who believes he can help him find the answer. Morpheus reveals to the now named Neo that world he had been living in is a lie. The year is not 1999 but rather closer to the year 2199. No one really knows for sure. Artificially Intelligent Machines have taken over the planet and have hooked every human being into The Matrix, a computer program created to keep everyone in check, so that the dead may be used for fuel. Neo is recruited to join the resistance movement and save the human species. The story for The Matrix is probably the best ever created for a film of this genre. The Matrix blends not only good storytelling and amazing special effects but also blends references and elements from classic literature and mythology which is extremely rare for sci-fi action films so like The Matrix.The acting is pretty dry in The Matrix but that is the way it is intended to be. No one is suppose to stand out but all are intended to blend together to create a better movie-going experience. Keanu Reeves, who is probably best known before The Matrix for his role in Speed, plays the character of Thomas Anderson, aka Neo. Reeves' acting is much better then most of his other films and shows that he is really maturing in his choices of roles. Some of the dialogue sounds weird coming from him and some of his actions seem awkward but that is his acting style that seems right in place for this kind of film that throws all kinds of weird things at you. Laurence Fishburne is absolutely perfect in the role of Morpheus, the man who trains Neo to free his mind from the machine controlled world. Fishburne presents a strange yet intriguing feeling with the character of Morpheus that always keeps you guessing at what he character is going to do next, which makes him a favorite among many fans of the film. Carrie-Annie Moss is pretty good as Trinity. Her character obviously kicks some serious butt but she is less focused on then Neo or Morpheus, who are more of the focus of the film. Hugo Weaving is extremely creepy as the cunning Agent Smith, a program of the Matrix sent to destroy the rebel movement. His character is a great highlight of the film.Overall, The Matrix is truly an amazing experience that must be seen to believe. The special effects are only part of this film and aren't the main focus, which the Wachowski brothers pull off with great storytelling and direction. That doesn't mean they aren't amazing by themselves. The special effect sequences in The Matrix are probably the best choreographed scenes you will ever see in sci-fi film or any film for that matter. It shows that a lot more went into each scene other then just the CGI, which is so rare in most films released today. The plot for The Matrix is the main focus and it is very well done. One has to watch the film more then once to actually get everything since most is thrown at you so quickly that it can be processed all at one time. And a lot of things that have to be taken from The Matrix are hidden in the film but that's what makes watching this film so much fun. The Matrix is probably one of the best things to come along in quite awhile. This singular film will hopefully change the way we watch movies for many years to come. It shows that there is more to a film then spectacular effects. It is the little things like chromatography, plot developments and such that make a truly engaging movie experience. This one film alone should be everybody's list to see.	5.0	The Moose Hole - Enter 'The Matrix'	2003-12-30	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A2KD86QAYDZV4R	Miguel Gonzalez	Come on, how can anyone say this is a good, deep, reflexive movie? Have you ever seen Dark city, Total recall, The thirteenth floor (highly underated movie), and many others? It has SOME good FXs (and all were show  on the trailer), but the action is in a boring video game style.  If it WAS  an original idea, maybe i'd say this is a good movie. But since it's just a  remix of many great stories, i'd say THE MATRIX is just a mirage of a good  movie.	1.0	Just many pieces of good movies put together	1999-09-19	12	3	9
0790745399	The Matrix	A34QHT5LIJND52	"Mike F. ""MDF3530"""	Q. &quot;The Matrix&quot; is:A. Intense.B. Dazzling.C. Entertaining.D. Thrilling.E. Awesome.F. All of the above.A. The answer is a most emphatic F. An everyday joe (Keanu Reeves) leads a double life. By day, he is a &quot;program writer for a respectable software company&quot;; by night, he lives in a squalid-looking apartment and is a hacker who goes by the alias &quot;Neo&quot;. He has a feeling that something is wrong with the world, and is obsessed with a man who is only known as Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). One of his assistants, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) arranges for Neo to meet Morpheus. At the meeting, Morpheus tells Neo the facts about the world.This movie is definitely a movie for guys. Bombs, martial arts, guns, and even an Old West-style shootout in a subway station. One minor quirk about it: while the movie itself was shot in Sydney, Australia, the intersections that the various characters are told to go (Wells &amp; Lake, Franklin &amp; Erie, e.g.) are in Chicago.	5.0	Buy This Movie!!!!	2001-11-17	3	0	3
0790745399	The Matrix	AURZ4YQ270W3T	Mike Freed	Unlike most sci-fi action films of recent years, where the emphasis seems to be on how well things get &quot;blowed up&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; has a brain and knows how to use it. It succeeds on almost every  level.Most prominently, &quot;The Matrix&quot; succeeds in showing us  violence and action in new and previously unimagined ways.Case in point:  the hyperkinetic action sequences seek not only to thrill, but also to bend  the mind, to introduce new possibilities. We all know that Keanu Reeves'  character, Neo, dodges bullets. But in a standard action film, he'd have  run away from them, or jumped off the roof.Not in &quot;The  Matrix&quot;.Instead, we get a visionary, mind-bending scene in which  we SEE Neo dodging the bullets in sweeping, amazing slow motion.Ditto  for the &quot;lobby&quot; scene, which is nothing less than a ballet of  violence, using Neo's and Trinity's ability to &quot;warp&quot; the Matrix  as a backdrop.Amazing stuff.&quot;The Matrix&quot; looks and feels  like nothing else ever made. Even the green-tinted scenes in the the  corporate &quot;matrix&quot; fantasy world that Neo's doppleganger Thomas  Anderson inhabits are so stifling and antiseptic that they're almost  menacing.And let's not forget that the premise that &quot;The  Matrix&quot; is based on - a world in which humans are unwittingly enslaved  to serve their machine masters - IS the most imaginative sci-fi premise in  years. It builds on current technologies - virtual reality, artificial  intelligence, solar power and a host of others - and seems entirely  plausible.&quot;The Matrix&quot; also has an enviable human element,  with Carrie-Anne Moss finding a great mix of toughness and vulnerability as  Trinity. Laurence Fishburne does excellent work as the enigmatic Morpheus,  though I found myself wishing we could spend less time on Morpheus'  Zen-teacher musings and more on his character. And Hugo Weaving is  beautifully understated as Agent Smith. Keanu Reeves' Neo/Thomas Anderson  is wooden, as you'd expect from him, but he does display moments of depth  along with the invariable &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; flashbacks.If  &quot;The Matrix&quot; has a flaw, it's an ending that's a little too pat  and seems more focus-group driven (not to mention sequel groundwork-driven)  than a real extension of the story. Otherwise, it's a masterpiece of action  and science fiction.And it really DOES show you just how deep the rabbit  hole goes.	4.0	Best Science Fiction film of recent years...	2000-06-14	2	0	2

0790745399	The Matrix	A2RCXHM9298L75	Mike Wells	The Matrix surprised everyone in 1999 by being so utterly brilliant. A truly original film, it had a similar sort of impact to when Star Wars came out in 1977. (Incidentally, the Phantom Menace came out at the same time, but the Matrix more than held its own.) Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, the Matrix is seemingly set in the present day, where Thomas Anderson, played by Keanu Reeves, lives an ordinary life by day, and is a computer hacker by the name of Neo at night. His night-time activities bring him into contact with a mysterious person named Morpheus (Laurence Fishbourne). Anderson discovers that reality as he knows it at the end of the twentieth century is an elaborate sham, a hoax. His world is simply the Matrix; in the real world, he, and the rest of humanity, are in bondage, enslaved by a malevolent artificial intelligence. The film follows Anderson's dramatic discovery of the real world, and ultimately, a dramatic discovery concerning himself. The film is set up for at least one sequal, but works well as a single independent film. The screen effects are unprecendented in their brilliance, and are enough on their own to keep you on the edge of your seat. Besides that however, the story is fascinating, and the script very appropriate. Keanu Reeves is not the greatest of actors, but he plays to his strengths here, highlighting the vulnerability of Neo. Fishbourne is very cool as Morpheus, and newcomer Carrie Anne-Moss supports them excellently as Trinity. The film is complicated enough to be difficult to condense into a review, and exciting enough for me not to want to spoil it by going into great detail; it simply demands to be watched.	5.0	Stunningly original.	2000-09-23	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"Watching ""The Matrix"" more than a decade after it was made, my first thought was to how well the film stands the test of time. Granted, it has only been 11 years. But ideas about cyberspace have become more sophisticated, just as they have become a part of the daily lives of more people. The internet has become indispensable and mobile, whereas it was more esoteric in 1999, when ""The Matrix"" hit movie theaters. The cell phones were bigger then. People still had hard lines. And ""hacker"" had not yet become synonymous with Eastern European cybercriminals. The word still conjured up images of a sort of amateur insurgency in cyberspace that sought out information about hidden worlds. That is what the hackers of ""The Matrix"" do.It begins with two voices speaking over the green glow of a computer monitor. ""Are you sure this line's clean?"" one says, hinting at deception. Then to Earth's dystopian future, where a beautiful hacker clad in black vinyl, possessed of seemingly superhuman abilities, fights with police and flees federal agents to a phone booth, where she disappears. After that jolting introduction to stunning, dark production design and gravity-defying martial arts, we are transported to more familiar territory. A sleepy hacker has dozed off, when his computer appears to send him a message. ""Wake up, Neo,"" it says. And ""Follow the white rabbit,"", which he does. He follows a punked out young woman with a white rabbit tattoo to a loud party where he will meet his destiny.It was quite an opening. Larry and Andy Wachowski, who wrote and directed ""The Matrix"", relied on imagery and ideas that the viewer would recognize to bring us into the world of the Matrix, while they created a truly beautiful cyberpunk aesthetic that audiences would not soon forget. ""What is the Matrix?"" is the nagging question that will drive Neo (Keanu Reeves) to discover that his world is not what it seems. He is a prisoner of illusion, a slave of an enormous system of inhuman machines. Kind of abstract for an action movie. But ""The Matrix"" cyberpunk tone, its stunning visuals, combined with themes that have variously been interpreted as socialist and capitalist, Christian and pantheist, postmodern and crassly commercial, give it staying power.A decade later, perhaps it has more meaning when a federal agent calls Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), fugitive hacker and hero of the rebellion, a ""terrorist"". And now that the Info Wars are upon us, the idea that hackers will save the world by revealing its hidden recesses, is either all the more nave or all the more likely, depending on who you think will win. Politics and post-modernist themes aside, any viewer who was unhappy with his or her job could, then and now, relate to the drudgery of the Matrix. It's one of those rare, good, character-driven actions movies that has wide audience appeal. And it would be a mistake to underestimate the power of the film's beauty, courtesy of cinematographer Bill Pope and production designer Owen Paterson. That's what keeps bringing me back."	5.0	Stunning Visuals and Enduring Themes Stand the Test of Time.	2011-04-11	2	2	0

The special effects are out of this world, the story unfolds extremely well, the plot is the most innovative one ever, the  script is just plain amazing, and the cinematography is superb. In short,  The Matrix blows away every other movie this decade. I would give it 10  stars if I could.I shouldn't have to discuss the plot, because by now  just about everyone knows it. I will say that this plot is so amazing and  so innovative, and it really makes you sit down and think. I think it's a  fact, not an opinion, that the plot is the most innovative one ever  written. I can't stress enough how good it is. The acting is well done as  well, and the script, unfolding of the story, and special effects are all  top of the crop too. I can't list all the good things I have to say about  The Matrix here. I have seen this movie over and over again without growing  tired of it. It has set the standard for every movie that follows it. All I  can do now is give my whole hearted recommendation. If you don't own it  yet, buy it now.

Borrowing ideas from Gnostic and Hellenistic Philosophy, the Wachowski brothers create a tale that will have you pondering your own existence long after the credits have rolled.  This movie is intense.  So intense in fact that it was written ten years before it's release but was put on hold due to the technology needed to produce the film was not created yet.  There are three parts to the Trilogy including Matrix, Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions.  All three were planned before the filming began for the first one and it shows.  Each film is strong in it's own right but together they flow continuously following the adventures of Neo (Keanu Reeves).  What Reeves lacks in emotion and acting quality, Lawrence Fishburne and Carrie-Ann Moss save him, making the film terrific.  Go ahead, take the Red pill.

Cifer has dinner with the agents and plots how he will betray the others and then have himself jacked back into the Matrix.How?In order to get in, you need to have a rod pushed into the back of your head.  In order to get out, someone has to unplug you.  Sooooo... how does this happen?  He can't get in and out by himself, but that is presumably what happens.  One minute he is having a drink with Neo, the next scene he is in the Matrix eating steak with an agent.Sorry - can't happen.  The only way it could happen would be if there was a conspiracy with another member of the crew.  There is not as far as we know.  So - can't happen.

The whole computer world never really appealed to me but it's a ton of fun trying to figure things out.  The shootouts are great and all of the acting is top notch.

Action, cool clothes, over-the-top good guys and villians and a great sountrack. If there was a slow part, I guess the first 15-20 minutes, which is the character establishment phase which is a necessity on a film like this.

0790745399	The Matrix	A284P8XSG9HREA	M. Ram	The Matrix is basically the Star Wars of this generation, a science fiction movie so profound and visually appealing that even a decade later nothing else has come close (Avatar looked great, but even its fans agree that it had a fairly unoriginal story). It's telling of our society that it took 20 years for the Star Wars trilogy to be tarnished by its sequels, yet The Matrix sequels came only 4 years later (along with plenty of games and tie-ins). In any case, it was a real treat to see the movie again; even though I'd watched it a couple dozen times before, the last time was a while back and via the original DVD release (which came out in 1999 and still holds up pretty well).I have to admit that the negative reviews regarding the Blu-Ray's picture worried me, but there has to be something else in play there, as I thought the transfer was FANTASTIC. The layers in the foreground and background looked fine to me (and almost 3-dimensional at times). There isn't one second of the movie that isn't razor sharp and crystal clear, and every little detail can be made out, right down to the pores on the actors' faces!Having said that, two scenes did lack perfection to my eye:1 - You've probably heard that the movie was recolored to match the sequels (ie, the scenes in the Matrix have been tinted green). For the most part, this has been integrated well, but in the scene where Mr. Anderson is being chewed out by his boss, I found the sickly green tint on Keanu's face to be overdone and distracting. Thankfully, the rest of the movie didn't suffer from this effect.2 - When Trinity first talks to Neo in the club, her face, shoulders and upper chest (she wears a strapless dress) show some strange image noise, possibly because of the way the scene was lit. This goes away as she approaches Neo to whisper in his ear.This package comes with tons of great extras. My favorite is still the music-only audio track (something I wish more dvds had), as you only really get to hear the subtleties in Davis' score when the dialogue and gunfire is removed. I doubt most people will go through all the commentaries and documentaries, but it's nice to have them there. Collectors will get a lot out of this release.	5.0	"""You have to see it for yourself..."""	2010-03-20	2	2	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	'The Matrix' was the big unexpected smash of a few summers ago.  It elevated Keanu Reeves to A-List material again, dazzled us with special effects and presented an interesting view of the not-so-far-away future.  Unfortunately, just like the world it talks about, it is a showy illusion.  The central idea is so clever that, with stupendous special effects hammered at you constantly, you almost don't notice how superficial this movie really is.In it we find Neo (Keanu Reeves) as a humble computer hacker who discovers that the world he lives in is The Matrix, an illusion and he is 'The One' chosen to free the world.  Along for the ride are Morpheus (Fishburne) and cute love interest Trinity (Moss).  The big problem though, are the agents, led by Hugo Weaving, who are constantly on the tail of these renegade humans.  Whilst the idea that the human race are merely being fed an image of reality by robots that have taken over the Earth after an inter-planetary war is absolutely brilliant.  It tapped into the public subconscious already exploited by public paranois films before it and 'The Matrix' became a smash hit.But besides from its central idea is there really anything that good about it?  The answer is a resounding no.  For once it's not Keanu's fault.  He may not be able to act but he looks enough of a hero to carry off this movie.  Fortunately he's also ably supported by a good cast and special effects that are truly out of this world, no pun intended.  The integration of slo-mo effects of a bullet moving slowly towards a person coupled with fantastic martial arts stunts definitely make it a movie to watch for its special effects.  However, the same choreographer for 'The Matrix' later worked on the superior 'Crouching Tiger' with much more grace.At the end of watching this you'll have doubtless been taken in by the showiness of it all.  However, all it really resembles is a flashy computer game, brim-packed with special effects but lacking a script.  The romantic subplot is unnecessary, it doesn't lead us on to the sequel and it falls over itself once it starts to think that it's clever.  Still, it will doubtless become a cult classic of it time, especially with its teen demographic, even if it doesn't say one thing about society at the time - just the gullible theatre-goers.	2.0	Great idea swiftly plumits downhill	2002-01-28	12	3	9
0790745399	The Matrix	A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	Mr B T Thacker	To deal with the flaws in 'The Matrix' might take a while. It isn't a high-brow or particularly profound film. What is it? An exhilarating, exhausting, immersive ride through some imaginative filming and  unimaginative writing.Complaints about Mr. Reeves can, in my opinion, be  more than cancelled out by applause for Mr. Fishburne, who is nothing short  of magnificent for the first half of the film. Hugo Weaving is also a great  surprise as the inhuman Agent Smith, and should be raking in cash for his  next few roles, if there's any justice in this world.Give thanks,  please, for the moody and perfectly-placed soundtrack, the clever SFX, and  the enthralling fight sequences. Niggles 'The Matrix' may have, but, while  you're watching, you won't have the breath to criticise. And that's all you  can ask from an action/sci-fi movie.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW	Mr. Cairene	In the Matrix, which is the virtual world we all(think that we) live in, the laws of physics don't apply. If the hero of this film Thomas Anderson aka Neo(Keanu Reeves) had gotten hold of that concept there would be no  film. I was tempted to give this film 4 stars rather then five, but that  would've been hipocritical since I went back to see it twice since its  release. I will explain.The most riveting scene in the film for me  was a very simple one, the group of rebels led by Morpheus (Lawrence  Fishburne) lead Neo back inside The Matrix for the first time since he  learned of its existance. He watches the hussle in the streets he used to  walk, he points out a resteruant he used to visit &quot;I used to eat  there, great noodles.&quot;  I wish there was more of that in the film,  more observing of those hopeless (or are they?) humans that unwittingly  walk through a manufactured existance. I wish there was more of a human  element to the film, wouldn't it have been incredibly fascinating, to  actually observe a couple of characters who live within The Matrix through  the eyes of one of our heroes. What happened to Neo's friends (virtual they  maybe). The Wachowski's only provide hints of this, instead they throw at  us incredible action sequences that are unsurpassed in movie history. There  are no words to describe how exhilerating the action is, and its reason  enough for the five star rating. But by going for an action overkill they  lose the poignancy that a film like DARK CITY created. The Matrix  frequently breaks its own laws, for example if Neo and his gang of cyber  rebels can jump from rooftop to rooftop because they recognise that in a  virtual world there is no gravity, why don't they employ this technique  when being chased by the agents? Ofcourse this kind of nitpicking would  have deprived this very thrilling film of its thrills. The action geek  within me is saying &quot;This movie rocks&quot;, but on an intellectual  level, it is a near masterpiece that doesn't quite follow through on its  compelling premise.Consider this. This review you are reading right  now doesn't actually exist, but it is infact a collection of tiny electrons  projected on to your screen. If amazon doesn't transmit it, it would cease  to exist.Take a little of The Matrix, throw in a portion of Dark  City and add the entirity of Orwell's 1984 and you have a documentary made  in 2048.

The film itself was filmed in Sydney, Australia, which somehow gave a different feel to the movie and the inclusion of some Australian cast members, such as the wonderfully nasty, 'Agent', only helped this along.A movie which makes you think, but not in a forced way, A technological thriller whose few predecessors (Lawnmover Man for one) were awful, strikes a chord in today's net-obsessed world.The movies few downpoints are the random and weak love scenes between the two lead characters, and the sudden and fairly confusing ending.

0790745399	The Matrix	AOMTYFH121ZVC	Mr. P. Crowe	I avoided seeing any trailers for the film as trailers these days seem to give too much away, so when I saw the video it was with an open mind. The Matrix was filmed in a expertly slick style very reminiscent of Blade.  There was a surprisingly good performance by the often lacklustre Keanu  Reeves who plays Neo a young man unhappy with his life. Laurence Fishburne  gives a stunningly cool performance as the `prophet' figure Morpheus who is  searching for `the One' his `messiah'. The supporting cast were also first  rate.By degrees Neo is made to realise that there is more going on in  the world than dreamed of in his philosophy. What he finds out is that  literally nothing is true, and his whole life has been a cunningly  fashioned lie.The main protagonists in the film are the inhuman and  creepy agents. These beings seem much closer to the true definition of `men  in black' than any other cinema portrayal to date.The Action sequences  throughout are extremely well done and powerful. There are superb balletic  fight scenes as Neo and Trinity take the action to the Agents lair.When  used, the computer generated special effects are of jaw dropping quality,  the hideous octopid creatures were particularly impressive.A major  weakness in the plot was the premise that the machine intelligence was  using humans as batteries. Machines as smart at these would be using  nuclear fusion for power at the very least. A better motive would have been  the use of humanity as an organic extension to the machines own  intelligence, feeding off humanity's imagination to expand it's own  knowledge and therefor power.Those looking for emotional depth in a film  should rent The Piano, those looking for excitement and action have come to  the right place.	5.0	A triumph of style and content, what a rush!	2000-01-19	3	3	0

From the  absurd notion that human bodies are power sources (just ask a physicist to  estimate the thermodynamic efficiency of human metabolic processes) to the  Deus Ex Machina resolution (Keanu as Messiah - &quot;He's the one!&quot;),  the noise and banality overwhelms what is original in this film.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1MKFYZZ2X46RA	"""mythologue"""	Reflecting back on the enormous popular and critical success of 'The Matrix', it is refreshing to note that people were overwhelmingly drawn to a film that conformed itself neither to the cynical and pessimistic bent that informs many recent movies nor to an easy and clich&eacute;d sort of optimism. The quest for truth is not mocked but strongly valorized here. This film is especially interesting for the numerous clues it gives about how spirituality is envisioned in the modern, technological world: organized groups and systems of all kinds (social, religious, political...) are discarded in favour of a more individualistic, master-disciple type of spiritual experience; at the same time, the notion of an official church is replaced by secret fraternities. This disregard for dogmas entails an eclectic approach that welcomes elements of Eastern thought (especially Buddhism and Taoism), of Hellenism and of Christianity; the path towards enlightenment is the Way, or Tao, which can't be put into words but must be lived. Neo's ongoing initiation features recurrent death-resurrection motifs - it does get caught up in a few noisy and overdone action scenes, but it remains fascinating from beginning to end. And the movie works well as an introduction to philosophy...	4.0	Spirituality in the modern, technological world	2004-07-10	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A1GGGK0DOV010Q	Natalie Rae Smallwood	I cannot say enough about this movie.  It is one of the finest combination of excellent story and amazing cinematography that I have ever seen.  I own both the VHS and the DVD, and I highly recommend the DVD over the VHS.  Why?For starters, DVDs are way easier to navigate.  There are plenty of scenes that you can jump straight to.  For example, I get a kick out of the lobby shooting spree scene, so I can go straight to that scene if I want on DVD, while with VHS I have to wait for it to fast forward.Another plus on the DVD side is that it has TONS more info.  And there are lots of different ways to watch the movie.  You can watch it regularly, or follow the white rabbit and catch behind the scenes clips of the amazing effects, or, and what I consider the nicest attraction, you can watch the entire film WITHOUT dialogue, only with the soundtrack music.  They bring the music to the forefront and turn off the voices, so you pick up on the different intricacies of the movie.As for the HBO Behind the Scenes clips and stuff on bullet-time and basic 'how they did that', that's on the VHS at the end.Of course, you don't have to be a die hard sci-fi fan to love this story.  I think anyone who is into technology will love it.  And anyone who's ever asked themselves, what if this life is just a joke and there's something beyond this?, will certainly enjoy this film.SO!  Check it out, buy it, rent it, borrow it, whatever.  Do it on DVD if you have the means to.  You won't regret it.  This DVD was our player's &quot;maiden film&quot;--and an awesome choice.	5.0	Awesome, mind-blowing story...get the DVD if you can	2000-12-24	2	1	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A3VY5UA24EZT72	Nathan Dickey	The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi thrillers I've ever seen. It is a movie that does not sacrifice plot for special effects, as is the case with films loke Lost in Space.The storyline concerns a man named Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) who finds himself hunted down by the Agents, minions of the ruling Agent (Hugo Weaving). He is advised by a mysterious man whom Thomas has never met before to attempt escape as quickly as possible. After being captured in the attempt, Thomas is briefly interrogated, then released. He finally meets Morpheus (Lawrence Kasdan) who is the man who had been advising Thomas. He grants access to the Matrix, a world that possesses total control over Earth. Morpheus is captain of a space ship inside the Matrix. He believes that Thomas is the Chosen One, the One who would defeat the Matrix and liberate Planet Earth from the controlling grasp of the Matrix dimension . . .The Matrix is a visual feast for the eyes, a special effects extravaganza, which is most noticable in the heavy combat scenes. But there is also a good storyline. The film also seems to be trying to make a point. The body cannot live without the mind. The film gets that message across clearly. It also seeks to answer the big question, what is reality? It gives the viewer a lot to think about. All this in an awesome sci-fi setting. An awesome movie. Why the missing star? Because some actors are not as convincing in their roles as others are. 4 stars.	4.0	A Sci-Fi Thriller	2002-11-16	2	0	2

0790745399	The Matrix	AEB45TKHZI37F	Nathan	The Matrix, the first time I viewed it, was amazing.  The special effects were mind-blowing.  At my friends house, watching on a DVD player, it was almost a surreal experience.  And then I bought the video version.  It was  still great, but the non-action scenes started to get boring.  Now, after  the third time, I can't stand it any more.  The action sequences, the  special- and visual-effects, are simply stunning, the premise entertaining,  the actors appealing and their acting not bad.  But for some reason this  movie just doesn't have much rewatchability value.Keanu Reeves was good,  Carrie-Ann Moss was gorgeous, Laurence Fishburne was fun if a little too  self-absorbed, and the agents were fun, interesting characters.  This is an  excellent movie to rent, or to watch once in a while, but despite its  amazing sequences, it lacks a certain...charm that the similar and superior  Dark City had.	4.0	Excellent Eye Candy...	2000-05-08	1	1	0

0790745399	The Matrix	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Most computer hackers use they're computers to escape the confines of reality.  In 1999, Andy and Larry Wachowski took this idea, and completely flipped it on it's ear with this surprise box office blockbuster that some of us love, and others love to hate.  Keanu Reeves plays Thomas Anderson, an employee for one of the largest software companies in the world by day; but by night he is Neo, a computer hacker who sits in front of his computer all night long, waiting.  What he is waiting for he does not know, until one day he receives a message from a man called Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and from that moment on, everything Neo knows to be real is turned upside down, as we find out that our day in, day out world is all a computer generated hoax to keep all of humanity enslaved.  Hell of a concept eh?  We all know what happens from there on, so I'll get to my thoughts on The Matrix.  The first time I layed eyes on this film I loved it, I loved everything about it, the idea (even though it mirror's 1998's Dark City, a superior film and another one of my all time favorites), the special effects, the costume design (tell me that Neo, Morpheus, and crew don't look just plain cool), and how the Wachowski Brothers inject kung-fu style fight scenes almost flawlessly.  Love it or hate it, no one can deny that The Matrix is not a landmark film in action and science fiction, and at the time it came out was the much needed sci-fi epic that fans have waited years for.  If you've never seen The Matrix, stop reading this and follow the white rabbit to the Add to Cart button.	5.0	&quot;Welcome to the real world...&quot;	2002-09-05	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A2FLLPHUFMKB97	Neal Winkler	Excuse me, but I must start this review off with a question, if you do not mind. Why are you reading this review? You should of already seen this movie, hence the reading of any review is not needed!If you have not seen this movie already, you are indeed a sorry little man(or woman). This film is without a doubt a a ground-breaker for a whole new level of special effects and action sequences. It has to be seen to be believed. The story, although based on a old philisophical premise, is a god-send for Hollywood. I don't want to say to much, because it might ruin the whole thing. Trust me though, it good... real good.And when you thought it couldn't get any better, The Matrix comes packed with solid extras. Behind-the-scenes-documentaries; cast/crew commentary; music only track; &quot;follow the white rabbit&quot; and &quot;take the red pills&quot; mode that will unlock ever more secrets of the The Matrix; and last filmorgraphies.	5.0	Get this movie already	2000-10-17	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A181DMMT0VUI69	"""needstobuyabike"""	This film is clearly revolutionary to the action and sci-fi genres.  In the fairly short time since it has come out, almost all action films have been painted against it.  The groundbreaking special effects have brought the expectations of the viewing public up to new levels.  With the genre-forming load that it carries, how it is that such a film fails to garner a perfect review?  The answer can be found following.Gore Vidal is undoubtedly a very intelligent man, a gifted writer, and man of excellent reason.  So why is it that many people can't stand him?  Three words: pretentiousness and condescension.  He can come across in his efforts as arbitrarily elitist and superior.  However, his talents are not in question, merely his presentation.  The problem with The Matrix is somewhat similar with an important difference.  The philosophy behind the film is never defined to any extent.  What little clarity that comes through is just plain silly.  However, the Wachowski's have managed to keep the pretentiousness that many find to be a flaw in Vidal's works.  So what you're left with is a condescending idea filled with mystical mumbo-jumbo without the solid theme to back it up.  There is nothing of value behind the excellent special effects.  The story and character developments are fun but not original.  The &quot;science&quot; in the film is pure drivel.  Human being as batteries?  Physical slavery would make a bit more sense but the scientific basis for using humans as a source of heat or electrical energy reaches the very peaks of absurdity.  &quot;Near the earth's core where it's still warm&quot;?!?!?!?!?  Not only is it still warm there but all known metals would liquefy before making it through the mantle!  Ok so it's future metal.  But the humans must have a way of withstanding heat that would melt steel.  There is no scientific basis for any aspects of the film.If one wants to learn about the existentialist-ish ideas underneath what little amount of coherency in the plot there is, read Sartre.  The fact that this adapts in some many ways Christian prophecy (The one.  The return of the one.) further undermines the existential underpinnings of the film.  Goofy musings on the nature of reality are the work of junior high philosophy buffs, and not particularly bright ones.The dialogue in the film is normally nothing short of stupid.  The only exception being the outstanding performance of Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith whose dry, sneering delivery steals all the best scenes of the film.  Laurence Fishburne, an undeniably talented actor, is saddled with most of the nonsensical soliloquies.  Filling out the cast are a somehow-bordering-on-competent Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano.  All put in solid enough performance but none redeem the plot.So then remain the special effects.  They are beyond reproach.  They set the standards for all ensuing films that aspire to have effects of any kind.  The film has spawned numerous knock-offs, both serious and parodying.  The better of those keep to just the effects with the lesser trying to pick off bits of the plot.  All in all, it's an entertaining action film that aspires for being something more and fails miserably.  After all, it's kind of hard to love the ideas behind the film when the machines are so much more amusing than the humans.	3.0	The finest case made yet for euthanisia, with awesome FX!	2003-11-12	9	6	3

0790745399	The Matrix	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	"If one could rate a movie's greatness by how many other copy it, then the Matrix has to be one of the greatest movies of all time.  This movie was the first US film to use ""bullet time"" whereby entire action scenes are filmed in slow motion slow enough to see bullets move across the air.  This is also the first movie to copy martial arts fighting scenes from Chinese films, and incorporate them into an American film in totality, including freeze frame shots, 360 pans, and really high jump kicks.  Combined with the great storyline, dialogue and casting, this movie became a trendsetter.  Other movies like LOTR, Shrek, and even Animal Channel specials have copied this style of action films.The storyline itself is incredible, probably the best plot of any movie released in 1999.  But it is not wholly original.  Earlier in the decade the sci-fi movie Dark City was released, and back-to-back viewings of both movies reveal many similarities in the story, setting and even cinematography.The casting was great.  This is by far the best movie for Keanu Reeves.  This movie was also groundbreaking in having a black actor and black actress in key protagonist roles; these being Morpheus and the Oracle.  The casting of Carrie-Ann Moss was also great.  A younger woman would not have lent the emotional weight as Ms. Moss.  The use of a sexier woman might have reminded fans more of the Pamela Anderson bomb, Barbed Wire.  Carrie-Ann Moss was the perfect actress to play Trinity; athletic but not buff, attractive but not bombshell, mature but not old.  Interestingly, the movie's basis on science and computers has kicked of a fashion trend in US cities with large populations of young East Asian women in the high tech fields such as Seattle or San Francisco.  Walking through these downtowns one can notice the large number of hot Asian chics dressed in black in the style of Trinity.This DVD is fairly simple; the same movie as in theaters, some special features but no extended scenes.  The movie is a great watch, but since it shows so often on TV, I would not recommend buying this DVD."	4.0	Beginning of a revolution	2007-06-07	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A3LYLRNW15DPU6	"NewWorldSmurf ""new_world_smurf"""	As a visual effects extravaganza, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is one of the  best films ever made.  The Wachowski brothers, together with a host of  now-Oscar-winning technicians, have created a bleak yet stunning view of  the world as run by computers, with effects that will have you hitting  rewind just so you can marvel anew at what can be done with technology  these days (the fight scenes in particular are mind-boggling).  As for the  story, well, it's nothing that hasn't been done before--ordinary guy  recruited into shadowy underground to save freedom.  The basic  premise--that life as we know it is essentially a giant computer  game--seems to be a soapbox for the filmmakers to have the characters go on  at length about society's dependence on machines and the old &quot;what is  reality&quot; spiel.  Lawrence Fishburne, who plays the hacker turned  father figure Morpheus, and Hugo Weaving, as the sinister &quot;agent&quot;  seeking out the last free humans, don't seem to be acting so much as  lecturing--in fact, everyone in the movie speaks very slowly and  deliberately, enough so that it gets to be funny after a while.  Keanu  Reeves is his usual expressionless self, but this is definitely a breakout  film for Carrie-Anne Moss, who doesn't show much in the way of acting  talent but does possess a splendidly toned form which is frequently  displayed in skintight black vinyl (and performs some amazing moves to  boot).  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a fun movie to watch, no question, but  it's not the great manifesto some diehards claim it to be.

Fay ""just a shopper"""	When asked at the first session of a recent movie making class I was taking, &quot;what is your favorite movie of all time?&quot; -- this was it!Of course there are breathtaking action sequences, moody camera direction et al. But what made this my FAVORITE was the ideas behind the ideas behind the ideas.I bought The Matrix on DVD without seeing it in the theater. A host of friends recommended it and I had just purchased a new PC with DVD capability. My first viewing was exciting. Special effects which now seem commonplace were new, the widescreen format exciting even on my 19 inch monitor.The more times I watched, the more I saw. The first few minutes of green tinged footage started to make sense. Understanding that it was SUPPOSED to be green, limited the time I spent trying unsuccessfully to get those flesh colors correct on my monitor. As I became familiar with the story line and knew what is coming next, the freedom to explore not only the ideas inherent in the storyline, but the actions taking place in the background revealed even more layers of meaning.If you have a DVD - ROM drive, you can watch the movie WITH the art director, the female lead and another director [embarrassed blush here as I don't remember director of what :)]. This voiceover version is like sitting on the couch with the principals and listening to their memories of &quot;when we were making&quot;.Yesterday I installed  a REAL DVD player for my large screen digital TV and can't WAIT to see it slightly larger.My favorite line?

0790745399	The Matrix	A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ	Nicholas Stix	"Four-and-a-half starsFor me, there are two Matrices: The one I lose myself in while watching, and the one that I dissect afterwards. First, The Matrix in action.The Matrix is the most visually dense, dazzling picture I've ever seen. From the title design of endlessly flowing green numbers, to the fight scene, to the exquisitely choreographed chase, to the bang-up conclusion, the opening sequence is breathtaking. The kinetic action is perfectly accompanied by Don Davis' score, which at that point evokes the dark feel of a classic, Hollywood thriller. And the writer-directors, the Wachowski brothers (Bound), make every shot tell.The story is about a future in which humans created machines so intelligent, that the machines won a war which left the world a desert, and humans their slaves. Most of the humans now live in pods, until they are harvested by the machines for energy. The rest live in ""the matrix,"" a virtual world created by the machines to delude the humans that they live in a gleaming, prosperous city -- actually, gleaming, prosperous Sydney, Australia. (The movie is muddled as to whether or how some humans aren't living in pods. I've seen it twice, and still am not clear on this.)The idea of ""the matrix"" as technological dream world, evokes Marxist guru Herbert Marcuse's 1960s book, One Dimensional Man. Marcuse couldn't explain how he was able to see through the technofog that deluded everyone else. The Wachowskis do a somewhat better job of explaining that part. They also take a page or two from Alice in Wonderland, The Planet of the Apes, 1984, and even Japanese comic books.It is the ""agents"" who give the machines a ""human"" face. The agents look like feds (maybe I need to rethink that bit about the ""'human' face"") - replete with ear pieces, sunglasses and interchangeable, nondescript suits - but they are machines; hence their superhuman power and speed. (The Wachowskis also throw in some ""shape-shifting,"" a trope from New Age/American Indian mythology, which was introduced in the movies in Thunderheart.) As ""Agent Smith,"" Aussie actor Hugo Weaving is a memorable heavy.A hardy band of human freedom fighters traveling around in a rusty old ""Mark III"" ship and a circa-1965 Lincoln Continental (the Wachowskis evidently have a soft spot for old Lincolns), in addition to those whom we don't see, back in the city of Zion at the earth's core, are humanity's last, best hope.The picture alternates between didacticism and action. Most of the lessons are taught by ""Morpheus"" (Laurence Fishburne) who initially seems to be the savior, but who is actually he who will groom the Saviour, ""The One.""Enter ""Neo"" (Keanu Reeves), the hacker whose name is clearly an anagram of One, as in The. The movie hinges on whether Neo is The One.The other main character, ""Trinity"" (Carrie-Ann Moss), is a passionate, butt-kicking female member of the rebel troupe.Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of The Matrix, is that within a set-up that could easily have deteriorated into New Age verbal diarrhea and emotionally empty technical effects, the movie makes you -- or at least, me -- care deeply about these people.The cast does praiseworthy work, especially Fishburne, Moss, and in a brief but moving scene, Gloria Foster (""the Oracle""), a woman of a certain age who still looks great. The stars clearly do a lot of the fighting themselves. Note, too, the forty stunt men who risked their very real butts for your virtual pleasure.Now, let's consider the elements that get lost in the sights and sounds of viewing.* The movie suggests a Christ-like savior, but This One has little in common with Christianity's Messiah.* I'm not crazy about Keanu Reeves; he's no Gene Hackman. And as for fictional saviors, I much prefer Lance Henriksen's tortured, all-too-human ""Frank Black"" from the classic Chris Carter TV series, Millennium.* The science is terrible, but then, it seems that ""s/f"" almost always gets the ""s"" wrong. Computers will never be able to initiate thought and action.* A parallel problem is the depiction of human beings learning physical skills without any physical practice, through merely having software downloaded into their brains.* Why is The Oracle fallible, and why does she quote the phrase ""Know thyself"" in Latin, instead of the original Greek?* As movie critic Steve Sailor pointed out, the movie perfectly matches Hollywood's notions of multiculturalism: The heavies are all pasty-faced white guys, whereas the good guys are a mix of blacks and whites.All of the above issues must be compartmentalized while watching the movie, in order to enjoy it. (I know - I'm too literal-minded.)Note that while kids usually love The Matrix, it's also not necessarily a good idea to watch it with very young ones. At its conclusion, my three-year-old started whacking away at me, in his best imitation of kung fu. And so, you might not want to show this to any of your children, prior to their thirtieth birthday.The DVD is chock full of goodies. One feature allows you to watch the movie with subtitles, in order to see how Don Davis' music subtly carries it. Davis breaks in at times, with his own commentary. His score is a serendipitous m&eacute;lange of styles - from classic thriller-style to punk rock - fashioned to match the unique mood of each scene.Another feature gives you the option of stopping the movie, to view footage of the special effects that went into the scene being shown. The purist in me complains, ""That's like a magician explaining how he does his tricks,"" but the guy who at 18 wanted to become a movie director, says, ""More! More! More! The more knowledge, the better!""Yet another feature, on the making of The Matrix, focuses on the Hong Kong-style kung fu training the cast endured for some six months, and the ""bullet-time"" special effects invented for the movie.With this DVD you get your money's worth, and then some."	4.0	&#65533;It Just Kicks ..., and Never Stops&#65533;	2003-06-19	1	1	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A13E8GDZXUN6MT	nick	Am I the only person who thinks that this movie got all the positive reaction Star Wars episode I deserved, and Star Wars Episode I got all the criticism The Matrix deserved.Okay, it certainly isn't a bad movie, good  action sequences, interesting story, nice Gigeresque sets, but Keanu Reeves  makes Jake Lloyd look like an acting god, why did they choose him to play  the part of Neo. I really cannot think of anyone who could be less the  'Chosen One'.While the special effects are good, the reliance on a  'dark' look to the film, almost renders the technology of colour TV  functionless.  The costumes are boring, the bad guys look like my bank  manager at a rock concert, the soundtrack is cheesy, the slo-mo fight  scenes are comedic and as for the relationship between Neo and Trinity,  well there isn't one until towards the end of the film Trinity realises  that their complete lack of chemistry together actually means she is in  love with him.And as for the rotating cameras thingy, what's the point  it doesn't fit into the story at all, they just shove it in because they  can. The only brilliant scene is the big robot walking through a field of  human embryos.worst of all, however is the 'philosophical' question the  film poses. I'm getting a bit sick of films like this, Dark City was good  as was the Truman show, but Fight Club was silly and The Sixth Sense was  boring until the 'oh-so amazing twist'. Is it me or were these ideas  staples of dodgy late night 'chillers' such as tales From The Crypt and The  Twilight Zone.This question of whether we inhabit 'reality' or a  'simulation' of reality was dismissed by the Greek philosophers as  ontologically and epistemologically worthless, as anyone who actually  thinks about the film realises, it doesn't really matter, does it. It's  about as thought provoking as the question &quot;what would you do  if...(you won the lottery, had three wishes etc).I would have given this  film three stars if it was'nt for everyone going on about how 'mad' or  'deep' it was.The Wachowski Brothers should stick to action films and  leave philosophy to philosophers. Now if you want to see real philosophy  check out the use of a phenomenological approach in Star Wars Episode I.	2.0	How original, another film about binary realities.	2000-06-01	11	6	5

0790745399	The Matrix	A11K4REFZUZ3PC	"""nickrostov"""	Naked Lunch, a novel by William Burroughs, described the events leading to the murder of a federal narcotics agent. Written in varying stages of substance abuse, especially alcohol and heroin, Naked Lunch attempts to  present the bizarre alternate reality of the drug world, along with its  rationalization of the crime. The agent had grown bad: simultaneously  overzealous and corrupt. His addiction was the junkies of Washington Square  Park, and he fed on them the way the centium programs in the Matrix fed on  the sleeping humans of the 22nd century. The victim there was not an  indestructible cyborg, but the killer in the Burroughs' novel was tacitly  aware that the crime could potentially bring the formidable power of the  Vietnam era federal government into the heart of their relatively secure  underground world. Neo, the drug-awakened killer in The Matrix, conversely  realizes that the murder of the guardian will almost immediately bring  about the collapse of the machine government.According to the plot,  at some point in the 21st century a war erupted between the people and the  machines. The machines won, but their domination was incomplete: a single  city, Zion, located so deeply underground that their energy source is  radiation from the Earth's core, kept alive the resistance movement that  Neo - ostensibly a computer programmer/hacker of the late 20th century - is  fated to lead to violent victory. In the course of his drug-aided  virtual-reality apotheosis, Neo ignores the attention of the female lead, a  very sexy, kick-boxing, gun-toting ex-hacker. The film could use a little  more romance and a little less violence, but that is beside its main  point.The Matrix suggests that there is something very wrong with our  humdrum lives, while making it abundantly clear that it questions American  culture without providing any satisfactory alternative. As it film, it  relies heavily on groovy special effects in its crazy-quilt re-presentation  of liberal borrowings. I am inclined toward the harshest possible criticism  of this film, however, many people (far more hip than I) think it is the  cat's meow. Thus, it is likely that it is I who have become the automoton  that needs to lighten up and enjoy an essentially old-fashioned low-budget  American movie.	2.0	Burroughs Re-Visited	2000-07-04	6	2	4
0790745399	The Matrix	A3NQI2JLNPFOF8	"nico_laos ""nico"""	"There have been many reviewers (even on this page) that like to point out the biblical references in this movie...about how Neo represents Jesus, and so on.  Actually, Chistianity is at the bottom of the list of religious influences.  Most people in this country see similarities between the movie and their own faith and draw conclusions that are mostly untrue.  The Wachowskis, being well versed in religion and philosophy went to great detail in their symbolism imbeded throughout this trilogy.The movie's primary influences are based in Buddhism and Hinduism.  In Hinduism, the adage, ""the world is Maya (the world is an illusion)"" plays an important part in the story.  The idea that the world is our own creation and by simply changing our preception and awareness, we in turn change our surroundings.  In Buddhism, the idea that the universe is merely a perception and through intense meditation, one can 'override' the current perception with his own perception and effectively change the surroundings.  Sounds like the matrix, right?If you'd like to read what was most likely the biggest influence on the Wachowskis regarding this film, check out 'The Stellar Man' by John Baines.  Baines, a Hermetic philospher, wrote this book in 1985 and metaphorically identified the 'collective unconscious' as a central computer that locks the minds of the human race into an animalistic state.  The stellar man would be one who has successfully been 'unplugged' from the collective unconscious and attained true freedom from the illusion.  In the film, of course, Neo is the stellar man; a being completely 'awake' and able to alter the reality around him."	5.0	What is the Matrix?	2004-10-15	1	0	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A1RUM9NZAR9F3X	Nicolas Lavigne	The Matrix is a very good movie. Some people said it was confusing and hard to understand, but I didn't find it confusing at all. It is the story of Thomas Anderson also known as Neo. I can't explain the story because you have to see it for yourself, but it is not as complicated as you think. The visual effects are ground-breaking and are gonna be imitate by every action movie in the future. The Matrix is better than his sequel The Matrix Reloaded, who has less story, but more action.

Immerse yourself in  the world of the Matrix.  You deserve it.  You'll never regret it!

0790745399	The Matrix	AIPB84OQTIRRI	N N	The Matrix is more real than we think.  We are in short symbiotic creatures created by a higher being programmed to do one thing: to live and better ourselves to become divine-like beings. That is the purpose that we are exist in this earthly world. Just think about it for one second...Without purpose, we are just some mindless people that are roaming the earth to comsume up natural resources and enjoy our lives out meaninglessly.  This very meaning, if think through thoroughly, can help us understand our existence.  The Matrix is truly a masterpiece putting together to teach us one thing.  The world is not shallow and one dimension.  That our existence has a purpose that allows us to elevate to another higher dimension if we understand what life is all about. It is our decision to choose how to live it because we have free will.  But when you realize what you can capable of become, you can be on higher level than everyone else and that makes you become the &quot;One&quot; -an anomaly.  This then will help you see what many others can't see.  They can only perceive through you but not what's in you. Take knowledge for example.  People say, I quote, &quot;Knowledge is power!&quot; Power of self. Power of devine. Power of greatness.	5.0	The Matrix  Is Close To Our So-Called Reality	2003-06-07	0	0	0

The whole concept was so fresh and imaginative...and deep.  I think the greatest crime was for the powers that be to turn the film into a trilogy.  I saw the second movie and never saw the third.  That's how much they ruined it for me.  Keanu, an extremely lucky and untalented actor, turned up gold with this script.

But as has been  mentioned in previous reviews, this film seems to be a dash of Philip K.  Dick, William Burroughs with some Gibson Tehno-Gnosis thrown into a blender  and voila, The Matrix. Still, as entertaining as the special effects are in  this fun movie, I'll still trade watching Donald O'Connor walk up walls in  &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; anyday over the wall-walking in The Matrix.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2I4D1QI7WV633	"""normamos"""	when i first watched the matrix, i immediately thought, &quot;this is my favorite movie!&quot; much to my victimization. the special effects seemed other-worldly, the acting profound, and the story smart. naturally, it was predictable, especially the fact that the oracle told trinity that she'd fall in love with the one - it didn't seem that obvious, but you just knew it. forgivable, right? after my second time of viewing it, i just couldn't sit through it - it was great but after seeing the making-of, i could practically see the wires carrying neo. by the fourth, it was great again, forgiving the knowledge of how it all worked. however, before it even got stale, i started seeing its flaws: the guy trinity kicked to the wall hit the guy behind him, but the strings were still flinging him about; a truck flies through a brick wall, but the bricks react like cardboard; that annoying guy, tank (michael jackson reincarnate - only cornier). then, i saw everything that was wrong: cheesy script, pornographic acting, underwhelming effects, yawn-enducing story. and the questions raised were endless and unforgivable: how does everyone know what's going on inside the matrix? if there are cameras, how come they didn't know the agents' every move? why didn't the agents detect neo's cell phone when he first used it under morpheus' direction? then, i realized how shameful and unoriginal the story really was (&quot;the one&quot;? come on). the attemps at memorable cliches were miserably broken down by the overuse of coincidental and drammatic lightening. the attemps at an analogous epic bears a metaphor enlightening only to a moron, if any metaphor at all. no merit or ingenuity found whatsoever. and the ending was gross. this gets a one because you really can't rate something that you can't sit through as any better. go buy gattaca or something. the matrix only puts the &quot;dick&quot; in &quot;predictable.&quot;	1.0	puts the &quot;dick&quot; in &quot;predictable&quot;	2001-05-05	27	11	16

This is a movie with a message, & it says...Ours is the world of the smoke & mirror where few are truly as they appear...& we are shuffling through life with zombie feet looking for someone alive to eat....yes, it IS a dog eat dog world, a monkey see monkey do zoo where you hate me because i hate you...you see.....we are as ants in a bottle of belief...captives of consciousness...asOur captors have surreptitiously corrupted our collective conscious code...so now everyone is primed to either emotionally implode or explode.In case you have not realized, i suggest everyone is hypnotized.....& share a collective psychosis imparted via media mass hypnosis.....make no mistake, you are anything but truly free or fully awake. We are drifting in the stream of a collective nightmare dream....oblivious to the obvious as we sink into oblivion. We are kept in a trance to work dance & sing like puppets on a string as our captors enjoy the show & dont do a thing. Realize it or not, you have been compromised in thought & collectively suffer from PTSS - post traumatic slave syndrome....& compulsively try find your own private dictator to rule your mind. You see, you have been set up psychologically to accept the unacceptable....outright open slavery. Yes, there is a plan to openly enslave every man. So they  tricked us into enslaving ourselves 1st.....by re-programing you to think & act your worst. Everyone...is compulsively participating in every manner of self destructive pattern of behavior conceivable. & they, in vain ego denial, choose to believe they willingly smoke drink gamble drug eat & sex themselves to death, & that they can quit anytime they want ...but their corrupted code will not let them want to quit killing themselves .....so everyone is compulsively committing slow suicide one way or another.But no need to panic & go manic as there is an escape from the mental rape. All it takes is an intercessor of advanced awareness to provide the turning of a key inside....right now....I send a gentle electromagnetic shock into your forehead between the brow....this surge will unlock your mental block....& so your minds eye will now begin glowing with otherworldly knowing...& the circumference of your understanding will begin exponentially expanding. Soon, you will see with xray vision eyes & without ego effort express thoughts deep & wise. So...Wakey wakey....snap snap....time  to wake up from your lifelong nap.......and step out of your unconscious cage of rage, open your eyes & consciously realize the rest of your lives."	5.0	Reveiw # 3,013	2011-03-10	2	2	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A1SG9L1PZGUHOQ	Nyx (Nyx1313@aol.com)	The Matrix - possibly the best movie made following the postEra of sci-fi/action movies of it's kind (e.g. Terminator, Total Recall and T2). Combining mythology, religion, literature and kung-fu to produce a  high-octane mano e mano smash. We start our journey in this 2hr 15min flick  with, Neo (Keanu Reeves). A man who lives a double life, a sofware  programmer by day and hacker extraordinare by night. He is contacted by a  group of rebels, lead by know-it-all Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus  believes that Neo is the chosen one, the one who will defeat the computers  who have enslaved all humans and blanketed their minds from truth &amp;  reality. The movie then follows on to see Neo's triumphant rise to leading  the rebels, and most importantly, finding himself. Carrie Ann-Moss plays  the ever so beautiful yet deadly Trinity, who helps Neo in winning the war.  Hugo Weaving plays an encore performance as the vicious Agent Smith. The  Matrix smartly uses it's sleek design and cunning special effects (SFX)  provided by big man John Gaeta to knock viewers off their feet. The kung-fu  scenes are explosive and imaginative (e.g. Walking on walls, blurred  punches), picture a Bruce Lee fight scene raised to the 10th power.  The  Matrix is definitely worth seeing more than once, I left the theatre with a  feeling of ehhhhhh ehhhhhhhh &quot;I don't know&quot;.	5.0	The Matrix - A world that parallels Reality and your Mind.	1999-08-13	4	2	2

Modern technology and special effects  are used to enhance the plot, not to replace it (like in laughable,  childish Phantome Menace, Ep. 1). Even Mr. Reeves, whose career soared  after some time spent in oblivion, deserves highest merit (of course, apart  from the scenes when his head is shaved...)	5.0	Great...	2000-05-10	0	0	0

If you wantto learn what &quot;The Matrix&quot; represents, read this book.  It's not easy reading, and is translated from French (post-modern thought).(exerpt) &quot;Such is simulation, insofar as it is opposed to representation.  Representation stems from the principle of the equivalence of the sign and of the real (even if this equivalence is utopian, it is a fundamental axiom).  Simulation, on the contrary, stems from the utopia of the principle of equivalence, from the radical negation of the sign as value, from the sign as the reversion and death sentence of every reference.  Whereas representation attempts to absorb simulation by interpreting it as a false representation, simulation envelops the whole edifice of representation itself as a simulacrum. &quot; (p.6, Simulacra and Simulation, Baudrillard)	5.0	&lt;&lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt;&gt;  What was the name of the hollow book?	2000-01-25	4	2	2

0790745399	The Matrix	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	"I re-watched the Matrix the other night, having just watched its outstanding sequel, Reloaded. The greater emphasis on philosophical themes in Reloaded casts new light on their more tangential (and thus confusing) treatment in the original film. For a kung-fu movie, the Matrix tackles some big issues, and while I'm not altogether sure it's completely coherent about them, I think writing it all off as having been plundered from lecture notes in Philosophy 101 isn't justified either (the same people who tend to do that also tend not to have actually taken Philosophy 101).The Problem of Free Will gets a good outing: are we free to do was we please, or does the chemical nature of the brain, and the fundamental laws of cause and effect, mean that we are not? And in the matrix itself all is not quite what you might expect: Both Neo's in-Matrix boss and Agent Smith offer Neo specific (if perhaps Hobson's) choices: turn up at work on time, or find another job; help track down Morpheus, or suffer the consequences; in any event on your own head be it. Contrast that with Morpheus' first instruction to Neo: ""Do exactly as I tell you"": Not what you'd expect from the arch-libertarian. The notion of choice, and the value of choice, thereafter reverberates through the film.This of course implies the question of Mind: do chemical and electrical reactions in the brain fully explain consciousness? Is human consciousness simply the product of a glorified organic computer? And if that's the case, what is the difference between the digital consciousness presented by the Matrix, and the ""actual"" consciousness our own brain gives us? Is there a difference? Segue to Descartes' ""Cogito Ergo Sum"", an analysis explicitly referred to in Reloaded.All this isn't to say that the Wachowski brothers are necessarily coherent in their philosophy or that they're doing anything other than name-checking famous dead people, (as yet, I'm not sure what point they're making with all this learning) but it does catapult the Matrix beyond the realms of your common sci-fi/action movie, and leaves you pondering all the iterations into the night. Some folk don't want that sort of thing in a kung fu movie, but for me it justifies the price of admission. And then to see Carrie-Ann Moss kicking butt in skin tight patent leather on top of that ... well, it don't get any better than that."	5.0	On your own head be it?	2003-06-16	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A2TOZDMQM1XM8I	Owain Wilson	To me, The Matrix is a film made by nerds, for nerds (I can see the 'unhelpful votes' tally rising as I type).  The Wachowski brothers, like the audience this film is aimed at, clearly see themselves as Neo,  transporting themselves into a CGI otherworld to save mankind, with  mysterious, beautiful women like Trinity falling at their feet.  It's as if  they are trying to reassure themselves that they aren't really nerds and  that sitting in front of a computer is actually exciting, or better  yet...dangerous.  And herein lies the problem.  The Matrix has an  unfriendly, exclusive feel to it; unwelcoming to the computer illiterate.  It is also very slow, and the device of freezing characters mid-fight  destroys any sense of building tension or momentum during the many action  sequences.  However, there is much going for it.  It is simply one of the  most beautifully made films I have ever seen.  Bill Pope's green-hued  cinematography is a standout; and the teams behind the effects, sound and  editing certainly earned the Oscars bestowed upon them.  The most  interesting character is the one everyone else I know seems to hate - Hugo  Weaving's agent.  His dry, precise delivery and mannered poise is really  quite entertaining to watch.  Anyway, thanks largely to Keanu Reeves'  attractive screen presence, The Matrix makes for a diverting enough two  hours or so of your time	3.0	An excellent idea poorly executed	2000-06-07	7	2	5

However I never understood why did they call that secuences like &quot;A  new Special FX style&quot; maybe because that sort of of secuences have  never seen before on a movie (only in TV commertials) Anyway if you are a  sci-fi fan (and even if you're not)you should better give an eye on this  movie; the DVD version is more enjoyable than ever and is the best way for  watching it.	4.0	&quot;A new style in in visual FX&quot; (?)	2000-01-06	7	3	4

It has so many layers that you'll discover something new each time you watch it.  Often ignored is it's strong connection to the gnostic worldview:  Perhaps we live in a world that's only a dream and need a savior to show us what is real.  That's what Neo discovers in his search for the meaning of the Matrix.  He discovers that he and the rest of humanity have been plugged into the Matrix and have been dreaming rather than truly living.  The question is, &quot;Is Neo &quot;the one&quot; that can lead them from their computer-generated dream world to the real world?&quot;  The movie is entertaining without an understanding of Gnosticism, but is absolutely intriguing with insight into story within the story.	5.0	A New Layer Revealed in Each Viewing	2002-07-17	0	0	0

The Wachowski brothers have managed to infuse a great, up-to-date sci-fi storyline with touches of Zen Buddhism, Taoism, and influences of modern philosophy starting with and returning to Soren Kierkegaard. The art direction is sublime, weaving future noir with comic book and producing a wonderfully believable cloth. The writing is solid. Even Keanue Reeves is believable as the in-the-dark protagonist through which we discover this world.The DVD is gorgeous. The features are solid. The behind-the-scenes is an amazing look into the massive effort involved in bringing something like this to the screen.The fact that the Wachowski bros were able to introduce such important and beautiful modes of thought - by infusing the very nature of the story with them - while wrapping the whole package in a action-packed veneer is breath-taking. A move of genius. An entire generation of kids will now grow up thinking, howerver subtly, about these motifs. This aspect of the film, historically speaking, makes it hugely important.

His life is turned upside down when he meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), two people who reveal a secret so stunning that Neo is unable to believe.  From there on it's a complete and awesome thrill ride.The special effects, camerawork, and editing are all top notch.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; plays with your mind at every turn, and hopefully everyone will like it.	5.0	What is real?	2002-10-06	0	0	0

I think it's a metaphor for the grip that society has on us- we feel we can't go back to nature or escape society's very tight grip, and that's because it's by design, by &#34;government&#34;, those who want to control the means of extracting our energy to work for them.

0790745399	The Matrix	A329U9CDUPKXAC	Patrick	The Matrix was a good movie but it was far from great. The hype over Matrix 2 is way over blown. I just don't like it when a movie's strongest point is it's special effects. The Matrix storyline takes a backseat to the &quot;wow&quot; factor. It's filled with bad acting and poor matrial arts scenes. The specal effects are neat for the first 20min but get old. How many times does somebody jumping in slow motion look cool?

0790745399	The Matrix	AUDSM2CTLLW1Q	Patrick L. Randall	"""You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.""  These revealing words spoken by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) touch just the very tip of the enormous iceberg that is ""The Matrix"".  Released in early 1999 without much fanfare, but with surprisingly high number of positive critical reviews, ""The Matrix"" became a science fiction and cinematic juggernaut not seen since the days of the original ""Star Wars"".  It produced a mind-bending story dealing with a fascinating take on reality.  It also revolutionized the movie industry through its use of mind-numbing, computer-generated, special effects including the now-famous stop-motion technique known as 'bullet time'.  In the same manner by which George Lucas redefined the special effects industry with ""Star Wars"" in 1977, which created an influence which has been seen in countless movies in the quarter-century since, the Wachowski brothers did the same following ""The Matrix"".  The 'bullet time' technique has been borrowed, ripped-off, and parodied in so many forms in the past four years, one forgets that it was only four years ago that this was introduced to the masses.The premise of ""The Matrix"", for anyone who has been living under a rock since 1999, can be derived from the very quote at beginning of this review.  It posits the notion that the world we see and live in is not the true reality.  Instead, it is a computer-generated 'virtual reality' designed to make the human mind believe it is living a normal life when, in truth, they are simply crops to be harvested for energy by a vicious race of machines who took control of Earth some 200 years earlier.  The very method by which the machines keep humans in bondage is also the means by which many of the humans strike back to reclaim humanity's domain over the world.  It is called The Matrix.  A cranial connection into this elaborate computer system is what enables the machines to control the human mind.  It is also how the few bands of rogue humans who have managed to escape the system will free other humans and seek to bring about the machines' destruction.  Operating on the theory of 'nature always finds a way', a few anomalies among humans realized that the Matrix wasn't real, broke free, and began the struggle to free all humans connected to the system.  The leader of one of these rogue groups, Morpheus, believes he is destined to find 'The One', the individual who will be able fight the machines and defeat them.  He believes this 'One' is Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), better known as Neo.  He believes that Neo will be the one who can defeat the machines and their 'Agent' programs in the Matrix where so many before him failed.There is a definite mentor-student relationship that takes place between Morpheus and Neo, as well as all the obligatory training and education scenes as Neo comes to understand what reality is.  Where this might seem perfunctory in other movies, in ""The Matrix"" it is amazing as each new path inspires a sense of awe in the viewer.  Some believe this movie has no plot or a convoluted one.  In truth, it is a plot with such depth that this movie has developed an almost religious following among its fans and in-depth analysis among academics and philosophers.  There is not one frame of wasted film throughout the entire movie.  Each character has a defined purpose and each one fits perfectly into the overall story arc.  In addition to Morpheus and Neo, there is the tough, yet vulnerable Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and the Judas-like Cypher (a slimy Joe Pantoliano).  ""The Matrix"" also introduces the audience to one of the best cinematic villains to come along since Arnold Schwarzenneger's Terminator and ""Star Wars"" Darth Vader.  It is one of the 'Agent' programs designed to eliminate the threat posed by these humans.  He is called Agent Smith and he is played with such frightening menace by actor Hugo Weaving.  Seemingly indestructable and definitely unpredictable, Agent Smith provokes the greatest fear among the brave band who do battle inside the Matrix.The beauty of ""The Matrix"" is that it is still as strong four years later as it was when it was first released.  The phenomenal success of this film led the Wachowskis to create trilogy out of this story.  It has the power and potential to be as strong a remembered as fondly as the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy.  To be able to be there at the beginning of such an amazing story now lets me understand how audiences felt in 1977 when they saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time."	5.0	One of the truly amazing science-fiction accomplishments	2003-05-29	5	4	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A203WCDVZFXRB8	Patrick Pun	I had the DVD version which I lent to a friend and it was never returned. Seeing as this is one of my favorite movies and having a bluray player now, I bought the Bluray version expecting that the Bluray video transfer would result in a new viewing experience. I was disappointed on 2 fronts. 1. Video quality: I could not tell that this had any improvement in definition over the standard 480 DVD resolution. There appeared to be quite a bit of noise in the dark portions of the screen which is usually what I see when viewing a 480 resolution DVD. 2. Audio options. Besides language options, there are no other audio options (ie dolby 5.1 vs DTS etc.). So it seems to be a pretty stripped down render overall.Not sure if other bluray versions of the movie are better, but the one I bought was disappointing. Not the enhanced high definition experience that some of the other reviewers have commented on.Doesn't change the fact that this movie is one of the best sci fi movies ever made, though!	2.0	Great Movie-- Disappointed with BluRay quality	2013-01-22	0	0	0

This film contains a struggle that is hard to find in Literature, or anywhere.  It is a war between two Trinities.  One member of one trinity is actually named Trinity.I also admire the interlocking faith each member of the Neo trinity had in each other.  Each one believed in and rescued the other.  Very subtle and powerful writing.  The only problem is, which Trinity has a future?Paul J Coleman - Author of BOSS CORE - Max MotivationBOSS CORE	5.0	Like A Religious Text	2010-07-04	2	1	1
0790745399	The Matrix	AM3HCTK2FV0M3	Paul Curran	The everyday world is experienced by you every day.  It's so easy not to think about it but what if it's not real.A man is told the matrix has you...  He wants to know what the matrix is.  He discovers the truth about what has been happening his whole life.  He has been in the matrix all along!  It's all around you.  He enters the real world and finds out the time is closer to 2199 than 1999.  There are huge fields where humans are no longer simply born, they are grown.Morphis believes this man is the one than will save mankind.  Long ago a prediction was made that the man that freed the first of us would later be born again and destroy the matrix.It became clear that the fake world was stopping us from being free.  It's a prison built to control us.  As long as it exists we are trapped.  Some people spent their whole lives looking for the one. Now Morphis believes the search is over... He must fight the agents and everyone who previously did has died.  But the one would not have to fight based on rules like gravity and logic! When he's ready he won't have to dodge bullets or be afraid.  In the end we even see our hero come back from death to end the final battle against the agents.  The special effects are amazing when he jump into an agents body and bursts out!  A woman is told &quot;the man you love will be the one&quot;.  He is left alone to fight while the others have gone through the exit.We learn that the future CANNOT be foretold.  Even the one doesn't know how things are going to end...  But he decides (in the last scene) to show everyone a world without rules, where anything is possible.In the sequels I would love to see time-travel because you could just rewind as it's NOT real anyway!	5.0	The fake world...	2000-10-03	3	1	2

I've seen my  fair share of action movies and science fiction movies, and this one could  be split into two- one action, one sci-fi- and each would still be great.  It's got an excellent soundtrack and simply some of the best special  effects to date. I encourage any &quot;movie-buffs&quot; (if you would call  them that)who haven't seen it to rent if not buy this one. Even if you've  heard nothing about it, it's well worth it.

Although the Special Effects and action sequences are great, they are very little compared to the films great script and acting. The best performance in it comes from the comic relief provied my Mouse(matt doran. Mouse never shuts-up, but in the procces of talking, poses some interesting questions. The Matrix is one of the few Sci-Fi films I have seen that is enjoyed by non-sci-fi fans. So what if all Keanu reeves does is look confused? that's the point. So what if the end is predictable, that just sets it along with Star Wars as a modern day myth. --This text refers to  the DVD edition.	5.0	Matrix on DVD, magical	2000-09-22	1	0	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A2ZTB8EDDR8RGW	Penguin Egg	"Sometime in the future, human beings create artificial intelligence that ends up going to war with its creators - and wins. Human beings, instead of being destroyed, are kept alive in pods, their bodies being used as batteries to generate power for the artificial intelligence. The world we see around us is an illusion, created by the artificial intelligence for a reason I cannot for the life of me fathom. If all artificial intelligence needs is human bodies for batteries, why bother going to all the trouble of creating an incredibly sophisticated illusion? What is the point? Why not just keep the human race unconscious? This is a real weakness in the plot and kept nagging at me throughout the film. Since I couldn't buy into the central premise, I found it impossible to believe what was going on. However, I did enjoy the spectacular set pieces. The trick photography - which is what these computer generated special effects really are - is breathtaking, and I kept wondering to myself, ""How did they do that."" The fight scenes are quite something. Keanu Reeves acquits himself convincingly but Laurence Fishburne excels. An enjoyable lot of nonsense but the end left me with a severely scratched head."	4.0	Sci-Fi Kung-Fu tosh, but trick photography is good	2003-11-01	0	0	0

Then when you dig into multiple viewings, trying to find errors and  inconsistencies, you realize that the Wachowski brothers have put the care  and thought into a movie that YOU, the true sci-fi fan, would put into it.

The lighting,  camera angles, and special effects combination is like the perfect spice  that you just can't put words to, but just want to eat again and again.

If you're not, I'm not quite sure, but I believe any cinema fan would at the least find it entertaining.  The most attractive part of the movie is that it's a  flick that makes you think.  You'll have to see the movie to know what I'm  talking about but it has a theme that anyone who loved philosophy in  college will enjoy.  If you're one of those types that likes to point out  scientific/technical facts that couldn't happen, you'll most likely find  too many for your taste, but if you drop some of the everyday seriousness  in life and sit back to enjoy a fictional movie, you won't be disappointed.  If you're worried about another Keanu Reeve's &quot;Whoah!&quot; acting  job, don't give that too much thought because it's a role that fits his  personality.  The only drawback of the movie is that it appeals to younger  viewers more than the older audience.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1EX6NR08YH874	Peter Soule	The Matrix. When anybody hears that word they would usually think of Keanu Reeves in a trench coat bending over backwards as  bullets graze inches over him in slow motion, or Carrie-Ann Moss suspened in a kick in mid air while the camera spins 180 degrees around her. These two things are some of what made the greatest movie of the millenium, the Matrix. The funny thing about this movie is how I didn't have any desire to see it when it came out, it just never caught my eye. I regret every bit of that. I never saw this movie in the theater. The first time I saw was on the little six inch screen in my friends van. Although the soung was coming out of two little speakers and the screen was about 300 times smaller than that of the one in my local movie theater, I was still more immerssed, more blown away, and more impressed than I had ever been by a movie before in my whole life. Everything about it was perfect, the story was amazing, Keanu Reeves easily put on his best performance to date, and the action/kung-fu scenes just blew me away.The story is not something I should tell, although nearly everyone has seen the movie, I bet there is still one reader out there who hasn't yet experianced the total awesomness of this movie.  The story is exactly what sci-fi story should be.  Science fiction is the one genre where the rules of reality cannot hold the writer back, allowing them to just let their imaginations run wild.  That is exactly what the Wachowski Brothers did, they applied every element needed to make not just a great science fiction story, but an all around amazing movie.The Matrix will be looked one of the greatest movie achievements ever.  It went beyond the limits of any movie, went where no movie had gone before, the Wachowski Bros. dared to mess with our minds, and the result was amazing.

Not as bad as his monotonous destruction of Speed, he  nevertheless serves to prevent a great idea from becoming a truly great  film.  Watch &quot;12 Monkees&quot; and the performances of Bruce Willis  and Brad Pitt, then compare to Reeves' pitiful work --- it's sad.  Even  Fishburn, who's capable of great depth and charisma, appears  one-dimensional and miscast.  Must be the result of lackluster direction.  The movie is worth seeing however, as the concept and the effects are  unique and highly watchable.	3.0	What a Waste of a Great Story.	1999-10-12	3	1	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A1U0G0F4LTIYEP	Phil Humphrey	"It's hard to fully summarise this masterpiece of a movie. This ground breaking movie is the second from the Wachowski brothers, manga inspired, it covers a subject touched on before in such films as the Terminator, and  many Japanese manga titles, a bleak and post apocalyptic future, where  humanity in enslaved by machines. This movie puts a new twist on this  genre, in that it suggests that the world around us may not be real,  &quot;What is real?&quot;  Maybe we all live in the matrix, but have not  woken up! Have you ever questioned reality? &quot;What is the real  world&quot; Why are things as they are, and who decided these things. This  is one of my favourite movies of all times, the special effects introducing  ""Bullet Time"" are cutting edge, the sound track and effects are the best  I've experienced in a DVD, the whole film exudes quality. All movie fans  can enjoy this title, my brother (non sci-fi fan) and all my friends love  this movie and watch it time and time again.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3BPY6F6C92ZKR	Phizog	The true test of any movie is how it fairs after you have watched it several times - and on this count &quot;The Matrix&quot; just doesnt have  the necessary staying power to make it an enduring Sci-fi classic. This is  a shame, as Larry Fishburne's performance as Techno-sage Morpheus is truly  mesmeric, a kind of Kung Fu Obi Wan Kenobi sans light-sabre. Its Reeves'  lifeless (yet accurate?) potrayal of a Hacker which does the most damage to  the film, but the blatant disregard for the laws of physics at the start of  the film before the viewer is made aware that this isn't the 'real' world  but is a computer-generated one could also put some people off. But hey,  its not all bad news as the action scenes are eminently watchable, and any  film that can succeed in making hacking/hackers look interesting must have  something going for it.	4.0	Coppertopped, but not quite Duracel	2000-08-15	0	0	0

The notion of manufactured reality was its strong point.  A weak point, however, was the film's anarcho-messianic theme.  In between these poles, there was a rather ho-hum formulaic plot, akin to that of, say, ""Top Gun.""  I must note that there are strong resemblances to a film which I'll bet few Matrix enthusiasts have ever watched.  That is Alexandro Jodorowsky's ""The Holy Mountain"" (1973).  Just about everything in ""The Matrix"" that is disgusting to watch seemed borrowed from the Jodorowsky film, as well as Neo's transformation into some sort of messiah at the hands of a magus figure. (""The Holy Mountain"" may be available on some web auction sites - check it out.)  The music at the end was good, but that's not to say I want to hear it booming out of some teenager's car every time he drives by my house.

0790745399	The Matrix	A21J8LD9WQSHO3	"""phyed-rautha"""	This film was created for me to love. It's a combination of science-fiction and martial-arts, the two most important things I do in my  life.Looking at the film science-fictionaly I have to say the script  must have been written with outmost care and heavy thought, and by someone  who has read good hard sci-fi before. There are no holes in the theory  presented, and that takes thought. Often, when I see a sci-fi film, I find  it's flaws in a sec, like the immposiblity of the time-loop in &quot;12  monkies&quot; or even &quot;Back to the future&quot; (Yeah, yeah, I don't  take it seriously too). Any way, the sci-fi level of &quot;The Matrix&quot;  is very high, and it's nice to watch a film you can feel was made to meet  the highest standarts.On the martial-arts side, what can you say? They  brought YUEN WOO PING to train the whole cast for 6 months AND do the  choreography. Yuen, if you don't know, is one of Hong-Kong's leading  directors and choreographers. He is the one that made Jackie Chan a star  (in his film &quot;Snake in the eagle's shadow&quot; and later in  &quot;Drunken Master&quot;), besides, it's about time that Holywood notice  the Hong-Kong action\Martial-arts cinema, and this film is a beautyfull  token of aprreciation.Another point to raise is the philosophic one. The  questions posed in the film, concerning the nature of reality and how much  of what we believe to be reality is objectively real, wo'nt be new to a  veteran sci-fi reader (more so if he likes Philip K.Dick), but they are  posed very gently and elegantly and they keep attacking the viewer  throughout the film, a thing that will make a viewer that is dealing with  those questions for the first time to be amazed at this new avenue of  thought revealed to him.The acting is excellent, the special effects are  amazing, the pace is fast, the overall experience is MINDBLOWING.See  this film.	5.0	Highly polished and the most exciting film of the 90'.	2000-08-29	2	1	1

In fact, artificial intelligence control us and show us a virtual world. The artificial intelligence use us like batteries and, when we're through, throw us away. There is also a legend: one day a special man will come and he will destroy the Matrix. According to a ""free"" man, Morpheus, Neo(the hacker)is that man. Neo has to fight against the Matrix to crack it.POSITIVE ELEMENTSI like the film because the idea is very novel, there are lots of fantastic special effects, there is a good plot and the actors perform very well.NEGATIVE ELEMENTSThe soundtrack is nothing special. If you want to undestand everything, you also have to see the sequel. There are some incredible scenes, but they're impossible in ""our world"".WHO WOULD LIKE THE FILM?In the film there are some technical words and so it's for people who like tecnology and computers.

I admit I did not understand it much but made a mental note to see it again.When I bought my home theatre, The Matrix was one of the first DVDs to buy. I have watched it 10+ times and will watch it again and again.The story is fascinating and makes you think.. Some  of the technology shown or implied in the film is already there or under research. The rest remind one of Leonardo Da Vinci's drawings of flying machines.. The danger of humans being controlled by technology of any kind is not that imaginary..The Matrix is an artificial ""real world"" created to entrap humans and let them live their ""lives"" in a virtual reality while ""real reality"" is in a dark parallel world where time and space are mostly irrelevant as there is technology to allow crossing the borders.The visual and sound effects are simply stunning. If you jump to section 29 of the DVD you will see and hear a battle taking place all around you - while bullets hit walls in front of you, empty shells fall on the floor behind you, guns fire from every corner of your room and you wonder what may jump out from behind your armchair or coffee table.. Just fascinating...Choose the Follow The White Rabbit version of the film to see how the special effects were created and how ""bullet time"" was invented and put to the best use I have ever seen.I don't think I will get tired of watching The Matrix.  I hope a sequel will come out soon and I will buy it immediately.The Matrix is the closest thing to Virtual Reality you can watch on your TV screen.

It is a fitting tribute to have the film that solidified ""Bullet Time"" into the film vernacular is treated to this single, solo book  edition.  The package is fitting for the Matrix universe, the built in book is a nice addition, it is fairly easy to read without having to damage the packaging, it has some good stills from the film, filmographys of key players and some handy bits of trivia. The inclusion of a digital copy is certainly a bonus for those who care about that sort of thing, especially as it is not advertised as a ""2-Disc"" special edition.The meat of the package is of course the actual blu-ray disc which is nothing short of spectacular.  The film in HD is wonderful. Crisp clean image that really highlights the films cinematography.

Keanu Reeves is Thomas Anderson, the normal every-day computer progammer who 'helps his landlady take out the garbage'. But by night he is an Internet and computer hacker going by the alias Neo. Neo is searching for something, someone to help confirm his belief, that there is something wrong with the world, something undefinable. Like his is stuck in... a dream world. One day he is sought out by the mysterious and beautiful Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). She tells him that there is an answer to his question that someone can help him, that someone is Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). But later Neo finds out that it is not Neo who needs Morpheus, it is the future, that is in need of him. From then on Neo is dragged into a world which is not what it seems, a world which cannot be real, or can it?A true masterpiece, this movie will just blow you away! Eye popping special effects, mind boggling kung fu, and &quot;take your breath away&quot; action. The last hour of &quot;Matrix&quot; has intense non-stop action that will just keep your mouth hanging open, your eyes glued to the screen. This is the ultimate action/science fiction movie I've ever seen. And not to mention that the acting is fantastic with Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss. You can almost believe that they have been doing ju jitsu all their lives (contrary to that they had only 4 months training with martial arts experts before filming). It's also not only that it's a good movie to watch, it's a good movie in which you watch while thinking. Most movies have great action and effects but, where's the plot? &quot;Matrix&quot; has a plot with twists and turns, surprises, and action.After reading all this I'm hoping you feel that you really want to see it.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ	Private Quentin Tarantino Fan	"Way back in 1999, The Matrix was a surprise hit, and while this movie is ten years old, The Matrix still surprised me.  I wonder if that's what people thought when they first saw this science fiction movie, the science fiction movie that was supposed to be passed under the much hyped Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. My mind, until recently, was probably the same figure.  The Matrix never really seemed like much of a movie that would be of interest to me, even though it's in a movie genre I have interest in.  Lest to say, it's 1999 again.Legimate criticism are there, of course, but those criticisms are easily transcends by good pace,  great action, and an intriguing premise that can easily become more pretentious if your not careful.  Keanu Reeves is an extremely wooden actor in this movie (somewhat in Bill and Ted, though some of his fierceness is pretty undeniable. It also helps to ignore whoever says The Matrix is deemed to be significant in the department of social commentary, high philosphy, and other pipe dream of that nature.  Maybe it's the moviegoers fault more than the movie itself.  Whatever it is, it's still science fiction to me, with a very cool premise that of course, in real life, would probalby never happen.  I think it's pretty safe to say our world is the ideal world to use us.  I do, however, think it's funny that the movie's premise of how something (the Matrix itself in this movie) is what you make it, is an exact representation of how the viewer will probably intepret it, whether it being a farce, pretentious, or a ""powerful source of philosphy"".  Whoa.Yeah, despite the fact that it's still an action science fiction film at heart, it's premise is more than just the mindless action akin of it's inspiration, including John Woo's Hardboiled.  If you don't let the Matrix become too pretentious in your eyes, you'll have a blast, and will enjoy this movie greatly.  It's parallel world itself is interesting, a ""what if"" kind of question (well, okay, some unpretentious, interesting philosphy is on display in this movie) It's true that the Matrix can be pretentious if you try to tout it as some kind of deep meaning akin to religion, but I think I've made my point across that.  I hear from many people that the Matrix really can't be explained until you've seen the movie, so let's just go with that.However, what I can vouch for is the Matrix's action.  Probably the best thing about the Matrix is the action and art direction.  The Matrix's dystopian future is portrayed with a cyber techno thriller, and the Matrix is fully visioned.  However, the action, and it's patened ""bullet time"", is of course, one of the biggest stars here.  The use of slow motion to emphasize bullets, explosions (that building explosion in the last half of the movie is amazing), and certain punches are emp.  And it doesn't induldge into any way so it feels like an empty -G@$m.  Energetic as well, something some of those Asian movies (which is one thing that makes Kill Bill better than it's predecessors.  F*** Lady Snowblood) kind of dull to watch.  The Matrix's ""techno-slamming visuals"" also thrive in this world, it's use of green, cyber text ( The Matrix Digital Rain) at the beggining is an example of the many cyber, still cool special effects.  The sound itself is equally crafted well, with those irrerestible sound effects for every action.  Also, cool use of Mindfields by Prodigy in the club, nice little touch that only a music geek would care about.Indeed, this movie was still a surprise, and I definitely am glad I own it.  As a result, I definitely will see it more than once, and will make sure to continue the story by watching the sequals.B"	4.0	The Matrix is What You Make of It	2009-08-07	4	3	1

Sure it all became a bit too much, and the lower standards of the sequels devalued the original in our hearts. But if you look at it impartially, on its own it was one helluva movie.It was one of those rare films that was too fantastic for its own good. It created so much hype, and so much expectation, that no sequel would have been good enough. The fact that the sequels took so long to arrive enough didn't help either. Since the first film was so revolutionary, a hundred parodies popped up left and right, and the whole concept was given too much time to be mocked.By the time the second movie arrived, the internet was littered with countless parodies. The second movie didn't help the cause by asking intriguing questions the final installment couldn't or wouldn't answer.The final movie, Revolutions, was extremely entertaining however. Frankly it was just as entertaining as Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. But in a contrast of fortunes, the new Pirates of the Caribbean flick has been embraced by the movie going public.It is curious that both are summer action films, with a formula consisting solely of endless special effects, yet have been received very differently by the public. At least the critics were consistent; they disliked both.The fact is that it is all about expectations. We were expecting the third Matrix movie to give us answers as well as thrill us. Unfortunately Revolutions wasn't quite the bible we were looking for. We went to the theater looking for brain food, and instead got presented with a filling yet not very nourishing double whopper.As for the first one, I watched it again after a period of years. It still holds its own. The special effects still wow me, and Neo's journey of self discovery is still exciting.	5.0	A true classic.	2006-08-03	1	1	0

On DVD the  special effects are thrilling. Sometimes there's a bit too much  shooting,but the very clever story more than makes up for this slight short  comming! Besides,some of the bullet special effects are ultra cool! This  movie will make your stereo or surround system jump and it sounds even  better if you have EX in your system.I recently added EX to audition Star  Wars Episode 1 , Japanese Laserdisc which claims to be coded for EX. The  Matrix sounds even better using EX,as do most 5.1 soundtracks I've played  thru it! This show has the WOW factor! Wow is it a fine movie and the  presentation is X-tra WOW!	5.0	The WOW factor	2000-05-10	0	0	0

The Wachowshi Brothers sure did some experimenting throughout the film and it paid off big time. Carrie-Anne Moss was gorgeous as Reeves' romantic love interest whilst  Fishburne's Morpheous was just excellent, even haunting at times, when he  floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee with his outrageous one  liners.Reeves, however, I feel, has redeemed himself.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3B43PU2IMB4V5	"""rasstag"""	Science Fiction is a story which can be accomplished without the assist of 'magic'..  although there are some that would say that the Matrix could never happen.. I would challenge that assumption... neuro-interfaces today  that could very well be the forerunner of things to come in this  area.The film has a lil bit for everyone and is handled quite well.. you  have the techie stuff, the conflict, suspense, action.. the only thing  lacking as the family pet in peril.  The special effect, a necessary  component in any movie it seems now-a-days are well done and add to the  overall impact of the movie.The interesting premise of this movie, is  that the 'reality' that we take for granted each day... is in fact a hoax..  the sensations we experience... the sight, the touch, the smell, the taste,  what we hear... are all simulated ... fabricated by a massive computer system  running the this 'Matrix' program.  Watching the movie provides the  diversion we are looking for.. but soon after, at least for a moment,  causes us to question our own reality.. &quot;.. what if... what if this was  happening to 'me'... how would I know.. ? ..&quot;  Most will not allow much  energy to be devoted to considering such an alternative.. but the fact that  they consider it at all.. is to the credit of how the movie was  presented.Excellent film.. could never happen for real... right?...

0790745399	The Matrix	A24JOL1ZRO0BNZ	Ravenlore	Maybe I've seen just one too many movies recently with the &quot;you just *think* it's reality&quot; premise (Dark City seems to be a common  reference point for reviews of this film) or maybe it's that the  &quot;intelligent machines represent the next rung on the evolutionary  ladder&quot; concept has sooo been done in SF literature.  Maybe it was  the too-often pointless use of the way cool effects, maybe it was the  extra-cliched ending - I'm not sure. But I think The Matrix is extremly  over-rated and simply bloated with self-importance.The story centers  around Thomas Anderson, a.k.a. super-hacker Neo, who's rapidly sucked out  of his workaday life at Very Big Software Corporation right through the  looking glass into the waiting arms of Morpheus and the rest of the crew of  his strangely retro cyber submarine.  Seems ol' Morph is convinced Neo is  The One, as in the one who will save humanity. From.....OK, well.  Seems  that the world Neo thinks is 1999 (they can't fool me, it has 1998 written  all over it) is really just a construct of super powerful AIs who are  interested in humanity only for the bioenergy it creates - The *real* real  world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland where only a ragtag band of human  survivors is left to carry on the fight against this unspeakable evil.  Quick, stop me before I clich&eacute; again!  Oh, and their capital city  is...&quot;Zion&quot;, one of many annoyingly heavy-handed pseudo-symbolic  references in the film.Suffice it to say that,  like  the Japanese manga and Hong Kong movies that form its closest counterparts,  it's told  pretty much through pictures and poses (for  instance, the Wachowskis hired  &quot;wire-fighting&quot; expert Woo-ping Yuen to teach their cast those  insanely high kicking kung  fu moves). It also tries to  create an atmosphere of  extreme paranoia based on the  Buddhist fear that the world around us is nothing more than  &quot;illusion&quot;, distracting us from scary truths. The fact is,  the Matrix is the kind of film which either appeals to you or does not, and  you'll know within five minutes whether to leave the theatre. For those  love movies with paper-thin characterisation and an excess of undisciplined  imagination it will be seen as a &quot;great film&quot;. The impact this  film has speaks volumes about the times we live in - Man, it almost makes  me dread the sequel.	1.0	Bloated with self-importance	2000-08-14	50	22	28
0790745399	The Matrix	A352T23KQAGEOC	Ravenlore	The Wachowski brothers take on reality. Obviously it's a subject that should have been treated by someone with more intelligence as the film dissolves into the kind of anti-technological paranoia found in 'The  Terminator'. It's true that the digital FX are awesome, but without a doubt  do not touch the power of The Phantom Menace. The story revolves around a  group of guerilla type freedom fighters who know that daily life is an  elaborate constuct controlled by artificial intelligence also known as The  Matrix. Indeed, in more typical sci-fi fair, the masses are not aware that  they are, well, 'enslaved'. This of course is not unlike the awesome 'Dark  City'.The rebels are lead by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a paranoid  Obi-Wan Kenobi type who is searching for 'the One' who will save us all.  This 'One' is Keanu Reeves who acts as artifical as The Matrix. Though I  guess we are not supposed to care he can't act because we feel sorry for  his burden as humanities 'savior' (HA!). With such cool internet names as  Neo, Cypher and Trinity they are distinguished by their just as cool black  leather threads. Along with the obnoxious Techno/Electro rock tracks - it's  MTV perfect.Though the pseudo Zen spiritual hokum and philosophy  (&quot;Human Beings are the cancer of the planet - We are the cure&quot;)  may enrapture 16 year olds across the world, the film is too caught up in  formula to have any real insight - Thousands of bullets fly, good guys  don't get hit, *yawn*. Like some comic book, the fate of the world comes  down to a big fist fight. Indeed, the real star of this film may be fight  choreographer 'Yuen Wo Ping' who did great work with 'Fist of Legend'.  Which really sums up The Matrix - An overdirected piece of Hong Kong flash.	2.0	Style over substance	2000-07-21	24	8	16

0790745399	The Matrix	A2VXLLBBT7CL89	"R. Bayerl ""Specialist in having fun"""	I first went to see &quot;The Matrix&quot; at the theater in 1999, and at the point where Neo (Reeves) is taking his martial arts training with Morpheus (Fishburne), I decided that my mind was not in a condition that day to be blown, so I postponed watching the rest until a further date.  My attention span must have improved since then, for now I see a fantastic movie, all the way through.  The description of just what the Matrix is, while a bit lacking in solid technical details (what is &quot;Bio-Energy&quot;?  what does &quot;120 volts&quot; have to do with power?), answers the question in a way that is disturbingly hard to deny.  &quot;Why not?,&quot; the open-minded may argue.  Perhaps what we see is a literal presentation of the kind of backgrounding that is in fact already done on citizens and subjects of the world, through computer systems.  The day that sentience finally arises in the non-living will certainly be enough to chill the souls of the humans who are responsible.  It has all grown so complicated, that no one could really prevent such domination, if it had enough of its own will.  The idea that the human is ultimately the better...entity...is shown by motifs like the use of martial arts (&quot;I'm going to learn...Jiu Jitsu?&quot;).If nothing else, we have one powerful metaphor for the way things &quot;really work&quot;, which is at a variety of levels and a variety of motivations.  Though reviews of the &quot;Reloaded&quot; sequel have been mixed, the original &quot;Matrix&quot; was one hard precedent to follow.  It will be on my list of films I can watch, over and over.	5.0	Top-notch, standing all by itself	2003-06-03	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A63WW5UC6KU18	R. Burney	I know my review is a bit late in coming, but for those that have either not seen the movie or have yet to purchase the DVD, let me tell you why you should do both.First of all, the movie is an exceptional feat of special effects, and boasts the most incredible and mesmerizing action sequence I have ever seen in any movie (starting with the infamous lobby scene, which is cool, if not vital to the plot). For the special effects alone you should see this movie. If you are a science fiction fan, the subtle nuances will appeal to you. The film has been passed off as a mere action packed, shoot-'em-up flick, but if you look closely, there are actually a lot of references to religion, nihilism, and the Bible. Another thing that sets this movie apart from others in the science-fiction genre is its unusual premise that we are all living in a dream world controlled by sentient machines. This provides for some thought-provoking conversations between Morpheus and Neo.Now I must warn those who haven't seen the movie that the action you expect doesn't come until almost half of the film has passed, but when it does, it is well worth the wait. The first 45 minutes of the movie familiarizes the audience with the Matrix and introduces the main characters, and there are a couple of strange scenes that will weird out some people (or both).The only reason I did not award this movie 5 stars is because the characters were not developed nearly as much as they could have been. You don't find yourself caring for them as much as you find yourself watching their motions on the screen. After all, it's only a movie, right? But it could have been better if the characters had pulled you further into the dense plot.As for the DVD, I highly recommend it to any DVD collector. The transitions between menus are fantastic and look good, and there are so many special features that it took me no less than an hour to look at them all.	4.0	The Modern Sci-Fi Classic	2001-05-29	6	3	3

0790745399	The Matrix	A281NPSIMI1C2R	"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review"""	"Normally I shy away from Sci Fi due to the usual goop and robot insect creatures, so I waited forever to see this movie. Keanu Reeves really got me hooked on the story. He is perfect as the software techie/hacker who moves from virtual reality to reality (they say).The fear of machines taking over the world is exploited to the max. Humans are not only used as a power source, they are bred for the job. Each living in their own virtual reality, while being hooked up to serve the planet. Anyway, that is a small part of the movie, although disturbing.Neo (Keanu Reeves) is drawn into his own destiny through a phone call and phones become an intrical part of the story as the way the characters move back into a state of reality, where their bodies are hooked up ready for their minds to be programmed with the newest information at a minutes notice.Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is trying to save the planet from the machine takeover and is convinced Neo is the ""one."" Near the end of the movie, Keanu gets into some real power positions that are highly attractive.He knows how the world should be, how it deserves to be, and everywhere he turns, he is faced with the fact that there is something wrong with his world. In fact, he is not in the real world, but in a virtual type reality that controls his life.In order to conquer this world, he has to start to believe he can. During this fight for what he believes is right, the special effects really capture your attention.I was pretty fascinated with all the concepts involved.

The special effects were great but the story was somewhat confusing and muddled.  The  performances from the principles was adequate, although I had difficulty at  times understanding both Fishburne and Reeves because of their  &quot;muffled&quot; deliveries. Both - yes, BOTH - have done better work in  the past.  I suppose a big pay check was the reason for their decision to  get involved in such fluff!This is one of the films that will not  &quot;age&quot; well.  Its use of contemporary terminology and fears about  present and future technology will be meaningless in a few years.  Thus,  the film, no matter its current popularity, will not make anyone's great  films' list.For all its Academy Award-winning SFX the flick was no more  satisfying than a video game.

0790745399	The Matrix	AXYDL9CGB7LZR	"Retarded Squirrelguy ""-Johnneh"""	"Okay. This book is not a biblical anything. Not New Testament anything! Nothing religious. The Wachowski Brothers themselves said it themselves, it is their own version of an allusion to one of the first, possibly most important book written in western culture. I don't remember the name. It was a big philosophical book, an allegory to human life. It was the story about how the entire world lived underground and were staring at the shadows of flames on a huge wall. They all thought that this was the only way of life. One person, though, has an idea. Their idea is that there might be something BEHIND them... and so he turns around and finds a huge flame, and behind it he sees stairs leading to the outside world. He goes up the steps and is astounded as he finds the outside world, and has tries to tell everyone else. So he goes up to people and says something like 'we've been living wrongly, i have found the stairs to the outside world' and the person, of course doesn't believe him. so he says 'come see for yourself' Then they come out and blah blah. This is where the phrase ""I've seen the light"" comes from. The Wachowski brothers themself have admitted that The Matrix was a metaphor to that story. Thus, as you see it odd that Morpheus says ""I cannot explain it, I can only show you it"" and stuff... it's not. You can't be told that a way of life is completely wrong, you can only be shown it. It's also referring to the way that advertising and all this other typical american crap is falsifying the human way of life. That people are blinded by advertizing, to where they have become 'robots' that can't think for themselves, they are controlled by this, thus the fight between the humans and the robots its just a metaphor for people struggling to show a blinded society the light. All this coming from a 14 year old kid, you should be ashamed of yourselves. :PI think that the plot of this story is extremely well thought-out and although it began to get somewhat boring towards the end, it was still extremely important to the storyline, that only humans can free themselves from ignorance"	5.0	Idiots!

Hero and villain are excellently portrayed.  Even the very textures and  colors of the visual aspect captured on film are gorgeous.  The only  problem I had was in the 'construct' when Morpheus is explaining things to  Neo.  They didn't need a reference to cold fusion, and should have further  elaborated on the scorching of the sky and the machines' inability to leave  the planet.  Other than that, it's very well done.	5.0	Great Science Fiction	2000-06-16	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A36969XLX0TQYR	Reubli	Art house movie this is not, but if looking for futuristic cool -- a good choice.I recently rented this on-demand for my tween to see with a friend. The film is rated R, but would be more appropriately rated as PG13: there is no nudity, a little swearing, and not really any gore (though lots of shooting and a little blood). The boys had never seen the film and I wasn't sure how it would hold up since so many movies have used similar story lines and action scenes since the original success of the Matrix. It was definitely must-see, as the boys were silent and open-mouthed the entire film and have talked about it nonstop since.I think this movie works best on you the first time you see it and is great when just taken as a fun movie experience. I've seen movies that stayed with me longer, had much more compelling story lines and had more substance...but when seeing it the first time, the Matrix is just cool.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"(What is the Matrix).  In 1977, George Lucas changed the landscape of cinematic Science Fiction forever with ""Star Wars,"" taking the genre light years ahead of all that preceded it.  Such a momentous advancement would not be seen again for over twenty years, when, in 1999, the Wachowski Brothers raised the bar again, taking the genre at warp speed  to an unprecedented level with their astoundingly innovative film, ""The Matrix.""  Co-directed, written and produced by Larry and Andy Wachowski, it is an allegory of salvation and redemption filled with symbolism and metaphor (the Biblical references alone should keep theology students debating this one for years to come); a thinking man's action film, accentuated with moments that are no less than profound.  In a world of the future, things are literally not what they seem, where it's Man versus Machine, Reality versus Fantasy, and few who know the truth; among those who do, is Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who has long awaited the arrival of ""The One,"" who it has been prophesied will be the salvation of the world.  Enter Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer with an innate sense of discrepancy as to the state of things around him; he has questions, most of which are still in the process of being formulated in his own mind.  (What is the Matrix).  Morpheus has answers.  And when they meet, it's Alice down the rabbit hole, and Neo's life is changed forever.  Reeves is perfectly cast as Neo, the enigmatic young man who may or may not be ""The One,"" and it's one of the best roles of his career.  He conveys a sense of removed, distracted urgency that defines his character, infusing him with both a strength and vulnerability that coalesces as the story progresses into determination and confidence.  The underplayed, subtle character development (largely unacknowledged and under appreciated) is a nice piece of work by Reeves.  As Morpheus, Fishburne is dynamic; he endows him with a quiet intensity that fairly roils beneath the surface, effectively restrained while leaving no doubt as to the character's power and purpose.  You understand his resolution completely by his countenance alone; by the way he speaks and carries himself.  It's a memorable performance by one of the truly gifted actors of our times.  (What is the Matrix).  Other notable performances include those by Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith), who brings a formidable, white-collar sinisterness to his character that is chilling; Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), a strong, vital presence throughout the film; and Joe Pantoliano (Cypher), who is entirely convincing in his role of a Cyber-age Judas.  Rounding out the terrific supporting cast are Gloria Foster (Oracle), Marcus Chong (Tank), Julian Arahanga (Apoc), Matt Doran (Mouse), Belinda McClory (Switch) and Ray Anthony Parker (Dozer).  A visually stunning, thought provoking, captivating film, ""The matrix"" is a triumph of movie-making that assures the Wachowski's a permanent place in cinematic history.  The special effects are cutting-edge, state-of-the-art; the choreography of the action sequences is top rate and delivered with a style and effectiveness worthy of comparison to John Woo's best; and, most importantly, the story itself is complex, intelligent, and deftly takes you into regions beyond the known.  This is Science Fiction at it's best, but beyond that, it's a great movie that transcends genre or category; a landmark film that must be experienced more than once, for new meaning is gleaned with every viewing.  Enhanced by a driving soundtrack that completes the package, highlighted by incredible action,outstanding performances and memorable scenes to numerous to mention, this is a movie that absolutely must not be missed.

Human beings viewing earth as a place of reality when, in actuality, it's a place of  deception. Surely you recognized the scene where Neo takes the pill &amp;  eventually bursts forth, hairless &amp; naked, as a new birth! The cosmic  battle &amp; the ability for evil to change its idenity at will is part of  real life as well.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3AZPJNCE1L3RR	Rev. Thomas Scarborough	"The Matrix was an enormously popular film.  While it would seem to be a rather monochromatic, brooding, recycled work of science fiction, its popularity will lie in its extraordinary visual effects, and a theme which resonated strongly with a generation.The title is taken from ""The Matrix"", which represents the world in which we presently live.  However, its inhabitants do not really exist in this world.  Rather, in the words of Morpheus, this world represents ""a neural-interactive simulation that we call The Matrix"".  While this world's inhabitants experience the simulation as though it were real, their real essences -- with the exception of a few -- are being tapped to power the simulation.  By implication, as a person's essence is drained from them, so is the simulation kept alive.Several issues recur in the film, and it is on these I shall focus here, rather than the more superficial progression of the plot.  The perspectives are characteristically postmodern:The film would suggest that the true nature of reality is such that it lies beyond decipherment.  Cypher states:  ""There's way too much information to decode the Matrix.""  At first, when humans sought to impose an incomplete system on their world, they ""marvelled at our own magnificence"".  Yet these human constructions led to the loss of dignity and freedom, ""a race of machines"".  The artificiality of ""the construct"" led, in turn, to a sense of alienation among humans.  Trinity says to Neo:  ""I know why you hardly sleep, and why night after night you sit at your computer.""  The film raises several other issues:  the arbitrary nature of identity -- ""from clothing to equipment, weapons, training simulation, anything we need"";  the question of ""misery and suffering"" -- conjecturing that this might enable human beings to ""define their reality"";  the concern that human beings are ""a cancer of this planet"";  and an apparent fixation with determinism, or fate.  In the words of Neo:  ""I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.""The film makes a few attempts to answer the conundrums of the human condition:It would suggest that we are capable of recognising our enslavement to the Matrix.  There is a reality beyond this world, ""a world without rules and controls.""  The door is there -- you only ""have to walk through it"".  However, it is a one-way door.  ""I can't go back, can I,"" says Neo.  That is, the post- phenomenon is not just a fad.  Not only this, but we would appear to have a mission to destroy the Matrix -- hence, apparently, much of the violence of the film (it has an R rating in the USA).  Morpheus explains:  ""The Matrix . . . is our enemy.""  The ultimate answer to life is tentatively suggested as lying beyond system and reason.  There is a difference between ""knowing"" and ""walking"" the path, explains Trinity -- and in the closing scenes, she says to Neo:  ""If you're killed in the Matrix, your body cannot live without the mind.""  Neo, however, continues to live despite this, apparently through the power of love:  ""Because I LOVE you!""At the end of the film, Neo Anderson (tr. new man) is returned to his original environment, after having discovered the true nature of the Matrix -- yet now he looks around him apparently renewed.  Finally he looks up, and takes to the skies like Superman.  Is Neo truly a renewed man?  Does he truly possess new possibilities?  Where do we go from here?  After all, only Superman can fly.  Among his closing words are these:  ""I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.  I came here to tell you how it's going to begin."""	4.0	A Film That Resonated With A Generation	2006-01-27	1	0	1

The first time I just watched the movie for its special effects and its amazing action sequences. The second(and each subsequent viewing) I watched it to  abosorb the story and the philosophical aspects of the movie. Not only did  this movie provide eye popping special effects, it provided a very  digestable plot set in the not so far future. Keeanu Reeves was perfectly  cast in this movie because his character never seems to know what is going  on(just like Keeanu Reeves).

0790745399	The Matrix	A3V7X6H19H60U4	rexinia@aol.com	An interesting idea for a movie, with dazzling special effects, degenerates as quickly as possible to a tedious barrage of noise and action movie cliches for those with short attention spans. It's as if the script  writers have fallen asleep while this work was in process. But not the  special effects people and artists. The visuals do a good job of  distracting you from how lame, one-sided, inconsistant, and un-inspired the  story really is.  Finally, in the last five minutes, the movie completely  falls appart, making no attempt at logic whatsoever, leaving you with  countless unanswered questions. The very last scene is incongruous to the  rest of the movie. If a sequel is made, let's hope it's more consistant and  thoughtful than this one. You could do a lot worse than the Matrix, but it  failed to live up to it's hype.	3.0	Great special effects battle a confused and muddled script	1999-10-21	1	0	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A386NVAVQV5WUO	"Richard D. Cappetto ""RickDC"""	This first Matrix film is just fantastic. Its a great a action packed science fiction, but it is also a reflection of our (and really about every nations) society in which we accept things that are true that might not be (for example particle physics says the universe is an electric simulation, eel its a stretch but I digress). How About this example we have republicans and democrats are pretend they are diametrically opposed to each othere when in fact there are both working fie the same super elite (at least the tops of both parties who have effective control). They are  using the Hegelian Dialectic against us to keep as asleep and divided. You ever wonder why you vote for changes and you get more of the same. Socialism for the masses, a middle buffer class and the elite's who lives like kings at the top? We are headed for a one world system based on what I just described but the masses slumber. On another front, do you know your TV puts your brain into a state much like sleep (alpha state) in which your sub-conscience mind is very suggestive and primed for learning? You not watching television programming, you are being programmed by your TV (Dems and Reps are opposed, Aliens are your God, Man and Machine will Merge, etc.,). While we slumber the elites are working on super solider tech (manipulation Human DNA adding Animal to it) and even working on merging humans and machine, called the singularity. I kid you not look up transhumanism. If only Parts 2 and 3 lived up to part 1, they were on the right tacks but went off the railed in part 3.	5.0	Brilliant!!!	2014-05-13	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A2EW96AE53PZMK	Richard De Angelis	"While I had problems with parts of this film's message, my ranking is based on its effectiveness as an action-packed marvel of surreal computer generated special effects. This dark science fiction story deals with the illusory nature of reality, the enslavement of the human mind (by institutions of religion, education, the media and the government) and the question of whether it is better to sleep through life in blissful ignorance of the forces that control it or deliberately expose yourself to some pretty awful truths in order to fight against those forces (or as someone else once put it, whether it is better to die on your feet or live on your knees). It was refreshing to see some of these issues raised in a major motion picture (even if they were dressed up in some fantastic trappings) and on a superficial level, the film had a great sense of style.My problems with it were mostly threefold:First, like all action-oriented films (and almost all films, for that matter), the hero was a man. In the first five minutes of the movie, the main female character, Trinity (played by Carrie-Anne Moss), masterfully demonstrates that she can handle herself every bit as effectively as Keanu Reeves' character, Neo, the official ""chosen one"" she later recruits to her cause. I don't see any reason (at least not a good one) why she could not have been the star (this alone would have set the movie apart from the rest of the pack and made it a much more interesting film).Second, the ""reality"" presented in this movie is so dismal and horrific that I see no real reason to choose the path of enlightened rebellion taken by its heroes. While there are plenty of opportunities for people in our world to fight ""the system"" and bring about meaningful change, the situation in this movie seems literally hopeless. I couldn't blame anyone for choosing to remain ""asleep"" under these conditions (although one unsavory character sinks to reprehensible depths in order to forget the terrible truths he has learned).Lastly, according to this movie, the best way to subvert the dominant paradigm is through superior firepower and fisticuffs. I can certainly enjoy watching movie characters display their skill with guns (Chow Yung Fat inThe Replacement Killers) or martial arts (Jackie Chan inanything), but the excessive amount of blood spilled by the heroes reminded me of African-American poet Audre Lourde's observation, ""The Master's tools will never dismantle the Master's house."" When it comes to the sort of totalitarian oppression depicted in this movie, fighting fire with fire only leads to more innocent people getting burned. Of course, the movie tries to address this by claiming that no one is innocent (i.e.: ""if you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem""). While I can agree with that to a point, it didn't make me feel any less sorry for the dozens of cops and security guards who get slaughtered just for ""doing their job"" (which, as far as they are concerned, is to stop a bunch of gun-wielding maniacs). The premise behind the movie would provide Keanu's character and his cohorts with a variety of more creative and less violent ways to deal with the forces they encounter, but the writers stick to the cliched method of conflict resolution so often employed in movies (and real life): ""shoot them all and let God sort them out.""If the movie intrigues you, you might enjoy a much more sophisticated story about a band of radical freedom fighters battling the powers of conformity and control. Many of the elements of The Matrix bare a striking similarity to The Invisibles, a comic book series written by Grant Morrison and published by the Vertigo line of DC Comics (although The Invisibles has frequent scenes of graphic violence even more intense and disturbing than The Matrix, it also does something that no action film ever does; examines the emotional consequences--for both the killers and the friends and family of their victims--of the ""good guys"" indiscriminately butchering the ""bad guys""). Morrison's entire Invisibles saga has been colected in seven trade paperbacks:Say You Want a Revolution (Book 1),Apocalipstick (Book 2),Entropy in the UK (Book 3),Bloody Hell in America (Book 4),Counting to None (Book 5),Kissing Mister Quimper (Book 6), andThe Invisible Kingdom (Book 7). Also, if you want to explore some of the real world control systems alluded to in the movie, along with some practical suggestions on how to challenge them (at least more practical than shooting a bunch of people), you should check outThe Paradigm Conspiracy: Why Our Social Systems Violate Human Potential -- And How We Can Change Themby Denise Breton and Christopher Largent."	4.0	Question Authority (especially Hollywood's)	2000-06-08	0	0	0

And that some of us  would choose to return to it after knowing the truth.

We go to  the movies to be entertained, and sometimes to be helped to think a bit. If  you want serious thought provoking stuff, read a book or a manual or go  watch a documentary.

I was really disappointed with the sequels.I believe the only reason that ""The Ultimate Matrix Collection"" is out first is that is the only way they would sell the second and third movie.I just want the original..."	5.0	I love the Matrix movie!	2009-01-14	12	6	6

0790745399	The Matrix	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"The Matrix (The Wachowski Brothers, 1999)So it had been five years since I saw The Matrix. When I originally saw it, I was unimpressed by it; I didn't notice the special effects. (Some people think I'm exaggerating when I say that. I honestly had no idea what people were talking about when they mentioned the bullet-time effects in the movie until almost two years later.) I obviously didn't notice much else, either. I gave it the most lukewarm of positive reviews. But because it has entered into the popular culture as such an influential reference, it's stayed on my mind. The ideas behind the film are intriguing, and I did finally figure out what bullet-time was after watching The Art of War, which was mediocre, but (when I first saw it) superior to The Matrix. Because of all this, when it popped up on a movie channel a couple of nights ago, I decided to give it another go-round, figuring I'd change my opinion of the movie.I have. It's even worse than I originally thought it was.The ideas certainly remain intriguing, but the Wachowski brothers take Morpheus (Apocalypse Now's Larry Fishburne, no matter what he's calling himself these days), who's supposed to be a kind of zen master, and has him spell everything out so that his disciple, Neo (Keanu Reeves, looking about as full of emotion here as he was in Dracula). The love-interest subplot between Neo and Trinity (Memento maven Moss... Carrie-Anne Moss) has so little meat on its bones that the brothers have to resort to a tear-filled ""I love you"" scene so the audience gets any clue there's a romantic subplot at all. The human special effects are unbearably cheesy (wire-fu looks even stupider when in slow motion), and the bullet-time has been done so much better in so many other movies I wonder that anyone noticed it. The only special effect that impressed me is the only one that impressed me five years ago, the rushing racks of guns.That it has inspired five years of discussion about its meaning is not in any way a testament to its value as a film; Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is still being discussed after a quarter-century. A better film could have easily inspired the same amount of discussion. More, in fact, and it would have had even more levels. This one just happened to get lucky. **"	2.0	Revised review.	2004-09-30	7	3	4
0790745399	The Matrix	A2244A5K1DCZNM	Robert B. Ostergaard, BA, BSci, MA	The MATRIX synthesizes works classical, biblical, and contemporary into a whole that is much more than the sum of its parts. It is derivative of many works, both cinematic and literary, including a theme from  &quot;Terminator&quot; and &quot;Colossus, the Forbin Project,&quot; with a  twist on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; holodeck, thrown together with Blade  Runner, the Bible, several works of Shakespeare, William Gibson's cyberpunk  style, Nietzsche, Buddha, Star Wars, Men In Black, and, visually and and  with a hint of humor, &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent  Adventure.&quot;Excellent gunfights, high tech slamming, and kick  boxing. Why isn't there a car chase?All of these elements lead to  enjoyment for the viewer, albeit in a philosophically confused state. Most  importantly, however, the movie calls into question the nature of reality  for those who normally never question the meaning of their  existence.There is one fundamental flaw in the movie, however, which  anyone familiar with thermodynamics will readily perceive. I leave it as an  exercise to the student.	5.0	The Matrix: WHOLE&gt;PARTS+PARTS	2000-01-23	1	1	0
0790745399	The Matrix	AVV7UXTHR0NWS	Robert Duncanson	Buying DVD's runs against my admiration of Thoreau.  But if he had a DVD player at Walden, I know Henry probably would have bought this disc.Most of us can get a hold of  any movie we want to see again, that's what the county library and Netflix are for.  I think Siskel or Ebert first phrased this maxim to live by.But the Matrix justifies the bucks.It is the most dazzling nearly black and white film ever made.It packs more layers of meaning than the gym rules at gnostic weight room.It piles on more subtext than anything to be found in Pinter or Williams et. al.It underlines the rule that sequels generally run face first into a tree stump if they push their franchise to a Part Three.  Think Godfather and Scream--the latter actually broke that rule by hitting it out of the park with Part IV.It justifies the bucks.	5.0	Neo, Thoreau.  Thoreau, Neo	2014-06-05	0	0	0

SciFi has been lacking somewhat here lately but the concept and originality of this movie  make it a welcome addition. Fishburn is outstanding, the rest of the cast  are good but the special affects make the difference. If your a SciFi fan  but are tired of the same old stories (time travel, alien invasions, Star  Trek or any other concept that has been thouroghly run into the ground)  then this is a must see movie.	4.0	A Must See	1999-10-28	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A38G64S5VMRI1P	Robert Graves	When I saw this film some while back, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect nearly what I got. I thought Keanu would be doing the &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; thing, and I expected the plot to be nothing more than two hours of music video montage. I was wrong.Keanu was good. He didn't play a typical role for him. Usually he's either the clear-cut razor-sharp hero or the mushy romantic. In this film he is the reluctant hero, which he played very well. He lost some weight for the role and is quite skinny. Overall I was very pleased with Keanu's performance and I look forward to him coming out with some other good films. Otherwise, the acting was superb from Fishbourne and others.The story is wonderful. It's well thought out, intriguing, timely, original, and is not the least bit porous. It has left me waiting impatiently for the next in the series.This movie broke all paradigms with special effects. They actually invented new technology to meet the needs of filming. You will see things that you have never seen before.The DVD itself is remarkable. There are numerous bonus features contained on the disk, making it a very worthwhile purchase.Lastly, I called this film the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of our generation. I believe this for several reasons. Like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; wowed us with new technology and a complex storyline that makes you believe that these characters and their world are real. The trilogy aspect is also recognizant of SW, and of course the religious undertones of both films are there if you look. Finally, SW was released when America was excited about space travel and exploration - it was timely. Similarly, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is released during a time of interest in the computer age, specifically artificial intelligence.This is a DVD that you must buy. It will be a classic twenty years from now.	5.0	&quot;Star Wars&quot; of our generation	2000-11-17	6	5	1

0790745399	The Matrix	AW3FTPCBPVQNB	Robert J. Schneider	This is one of only two movies that I have ever seen THREE times in the theater...and, since I bought it on DVD a year ago, I have probably seen it a total of at least 10 times by now.  It is a movie that draws you in, not just with its mind-boggling special effects, but also with its underlying story.  The story is so neatly woven into it all, and the whole film is so fast-paced, that on first (or even third) viewing, it's difficult to be able to follow it all.  Sorry, all you &quot;dissenters&quot; out there, but if you didn't like this film, then you obviously just didn't get it.I'm a relatively smart moviegoer, but I did not totally get all the details in the entire movie myself, the first few times around.  I loved it the very first time I saw it, and I knew that it was a great, groundbreaking film.  But honestly, I got maybe about 40% of what was going on.  I began to lose track of what was happening after Neo takes the red pill.  Fortunately, this movie works on so many levels, that it can even be enjoyed on the level of a high-tech, high-kickin', sci-fi-action thriller.  But something about this film intrigued me so much, the way &quot;The X-Files&quot; on TV used to intrigue me.The second time I saw THE MATRIX, I was up to about 60% in my understanding of it.  At this point, I got most of the major details, (like what happens after Neo takes the red pill) but I still didn't fully understand exactly what the agents, or the sentinels, were.  On my thrid viewing, I finally got this point, but I wouldn't say that I got 100% of it--I got maybe up to 90%.  But everytime I have seen it since, it adds something new to my understanding of the incredible world of THE MATRIX.  This is the mark of a GREAT FILM:  One that makes you want to come back for more, even when you don't understand everything in it, and gives you something new every single time you see it.THE MATRIX was great to see in the theater, but it is an even greater experience on DVD.  It was cool on the big screen, but on DVD the film is much sharper (it almost makes you think that your TV set is HDTV), and it has all the great extras that you would expect from a DVD--plus many great ones that you WOULDN'T expect.  Besides the great behind-the-scenes documentary &quot;HBO First Look: Making the Matrix,&quot; you get the incredible feature &quot;Take the red pills to view two hidden special effects documentaries: &quot;What is Bullet Time?&quot; and &quot;What is the Concept?&quot;&quot; which delves much more into what the special effects are and how they are accomplished.  Plus, there is the feature that allows you to see the film and, at certain points, a &quot;white rabbit&quot; pops up on the lower right-hand corner of the screen.  If you click &quot;ENTER&quot; on your remote while the white rabbit is up on the screen, you get taken to a mini-behind-the-scenes-featurette on exactly how they made that particular scene (this is NOT taken out of the HBO behind-the-scenes feature.  It's pretty incredible!  Of course, the Commentary by Carrie-Anne Moss, editor Zach Staenberg and visual effects supervisor John Gaeta is also very cool. Overall, it's like nothing I've ever seen before.  I can't wait for THE MATRIX 2, or whatever its title will be, to come out!!Bottom line to all this: If you loved the movie, you'll go ga-ga over the DVD!!!!	5.0	Incredible Film, Even More Incredible DVD :)	2001-05-15	6	5	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A1Z2DI0NOYGXBY	Rollo Tomasi	To those who saw Johnny Mnemonic, and thought, there is a lot of potential here but they didn't quite pull it off, The Matrix is the answer. Here we have a scifi movie that doesn't come short on any end. When we look at  films which use a great deal of special effects, they form two catagories:  Films which have built their plot around the effects and Films which build  the effects around the plot. An example of the first would be Star ship  troopers...enough said. The Matrix fall under the latter category. Where  amazing special effects are used to portray amazing ideas. The Matrix not  only uses these effects near to perfection, but takes the genre to a whole  other level. The combination of ground breaking special effects, with an  intelligent plot, a pinch of Japanese Animation spirit, and martial  artestry second to none, makes this I dare say the best Scifi/action movie  since Aliens.

Or we can stay awake and risk our destruction. Even before Plato's &quot;Alegory of the Cave&quot; some men and women have been aware of this great struggle.

0790745399	The Matrix	A19DAH3XY8U4J3	Ron Blum	I won't deny it: I enjoyed the Matrix.  It's a fun film.  It's got great special effects, quick pacing, and a compelling story-line.  In the end, though, it's nothing more than a fast-paced action flick with high  production values but no substance or meaning, wooden acting, and a lack of  original ideas.  The story is stylish but cliched: A dystopian future run  by machines, the search for a prophecided messiah, a ragged band of rebels  fighting against the system, reality as a work of fiction, the choice  between an idyllic life in slavery or a tortuous life in freedom--we've  seen all of these before, just never with so many guns and black  coats.The special effects are great, the action is quick-paced, and the  story is fun to follow, but that's about as deep as this movie gets.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2E7E9EWADK4S6	"Rosemary Thornton ""Niece of Murder Victim, Ad..."	It's an interesting flick with a thoughtful premise - artificial intelligence gone wild and the physicality of real life is not at all what it appears to be.It is a movie that makes you think and I did enjoy much  of it.However, perhaps I didn't get the deeper message of &quot;The  Matrix.&quot;Haven't we all had that feeling that life is more of a  mental experience than a physical one? That physical life is downright  puzzling at times? What proof do we have of our own existence, outside of  our five senses? If this movie is the medium that gets everyone to thinking  these deep thoughts, then I suppose it's a good thing.Einstein said  many years ago &quot;To those of us who are committed physicists, the past,  present and future (ie: mortal limitations?) are only illusion, however  persistent.&quot;And one of those good old philosophers (maybe Kant?)  said, in substance, &quot;if I fall asleep and dream that I'm warming  myself in front of a fire, the whole experience seems to be completely  real. How am I to know what is real and what is the dream?&quot; (my  paraphrase)Perhaps this movie is simply the vehicle that gets the young  folks asking the deep questions the philosophers have pondered for  centuries.I found this movie kind of so-so, myself. A strong 3, but not  much more. Fisburne's acting was exemplary, but he's one of my faves,  anyway.The violence and graphic depictions (such as the de-bugging)  pretty well grossed me out.	3.0	I'm not sure why this movie blows everyone away...	2000-04-28	8	6	2

PAYNE ""taikutsuna"""	"quick question. what do you call a group of people who believe there way is better and then go around killing people indiscriminently to prove it...........if you said terrorist you would be correct.That was one of the many flaws in this movie that kept me from really getting into it. after all morpheus admits ""we don't know what happened we can only assume humans blocked out the sun to kill the computers"" (yet what if the sun was fading so in order to survive humans put themselves into this reality?)it beats eating slop from a tube and having no sun. without a real antagonist for this story NEO and his crew are just terrorist. But no big it is only a movie.as far as the subject matter it was presented in a flashier way but the story is not entirely unique if you have seen ""THEY LIVE,TOTAL RECALL,ABRE LOS OJOS or several episodes of the ""outer limits"" and so on you have seen this idea before.Don't get me wrong i enjoyed this movie somewhat...ironically it was all the various flaws in the logic of this movie that caused me to analyze it... thus enjoy it.it is mainly the lack of attention to detail that i can't give this five stars i kept saying to my self ""this would be really good if only...""so in closing i give this movie a generous 3 stars because i did enjoy it even though i thought it only deserved two stars"	3.0	would have been spectacular with some attention to detail.	2002-09-25	1	0	1
0790745399	The Matrix	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	Finally Keanu Reeves has found the perfect role: his Neo is a human blank slate who goes through a harrowing transformation while discovering the horrific secrets of The Matrix.  An eye-popping, non-stop thirll ride, the  Wachowski's super-cool movie astounds you at every turn, and its dizzying  pop-psychology and wildly fantastic premise is actually thought-provoking.  Like all good rides, it moves like lightning, so you better pay attention;  this movie is crammed with lots of subtle touches, and the Oscar-winning  special effects require at least a second viewing.  Four stars instead of  five for one reason: for all its slickness and entertaining thrills, the  characters in this movie do not illicit the kind of pathos they might have  with just a bit more personal history and interaction; it is more a series  of posturing without real heart.  With the hyper-cool Carrie Moss as Neo's  potential babe, just a bit more stylized romance a la The Terminator would  have made given this movie more emotional resonance, though as it stands it  is a science fiction classic for the ages.	4.0	COOL COOL COOL	2000-04-21	8	6	2

It's pretty cool but don't leave your chair or you might be totally confused.  The effects are great but the acting could have been better.  I am not impressed with Keanu Reeves....can't get passed the Bill and Ted thing. There are better movies out there, but this one is worth watching once to form your own opinion.  My favorite part of this film was the camera work.  It is far from traditional. The story itself was thought provoking but could have been told better. Overall, I've always liked this idea for a movie.  For those of you who gave it 1 star, I can't believe you haven't seen worse, but then again, just as I am, everyone is entitled to their own opinions.

If the film was nothing less than some shoot-em'-up action flick, I doubt it would be as successful as it is now.  Visually, this film gives you little chance to rest before something even more stunning appears, which is a credit to all those involved.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1RC7W0ZHJIJZW	R. Sundquist	"I first saw this movie in the theater back in 1999. It had its moments, but not many. To start, the acting is terrible. Keanu Reeves has the emotive ability of a toaster, and Carrie Ann Moss is about as sympathetic as the ubiquitous sexy sidekick babe in a generic video game. Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard. I imagine the characters in this film spend about six hours out of every day designing the leather bondage costumes they'll wear next time they're in the Matrix.For the first half of the movie, it seems to be interested in questioning reality, which, as the title to my review suggests, was already done more topically in previous films. ""The Matrix"" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen.""The Matrix"" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clich&eacute;d movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that ""neo"" is an anagram of ""one."" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day.The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly. If the villains of the movie really were programs in the Matrix, shouldn't they be able to manipulate it without having to resort to kung fu?Anyway, I didn't like this movie. ""Dark City"" is a better, more original version of the same premise, without the Chosen One nonsense or the martial arts."	2.0	"The Unofficial Sequel to ""The Truman Show""?"	2008-07-26	6	3	3
0790745399	The Matrix	AMJPFNUKED92B	"R. T. Meisenholder ""Romanticist Philosopher"""	&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a movie about the well worn science fiction concept of virtual reality. Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) plays a leader of a rebellion in search of someone he calls &quot;The One&quot;.(This person  possesses the knowledge necessary to understand how to crack the  programming code for The Matrix) Reality as we know it is depicted as a  machine controlled artificial world where all that is experienced is  controlled and programmed by living machines that have human beings in pods  that are all connected to the central mainframe by a series of  interconnected materials.(What ever might be capable of sending  information) Life is an illusion that is presented by the Matrix. Morpheus  and a group of rebels that have escaped the Matrix, in a ship of some kind,  have pinpointed the location of Neo(Keanu Reeves) whom they believe is  &quot;The One&quot; with the knowledge. They eject him from The Matrix and  bring him aboard their ship. Morpheus begins to train Neo as to how to  fight The Matrix. While the concept for &quot;The Matrix&quot; is  interesting to an extent there are logical flaws that hurt the thought  provoking aspect of the film. One aspect has me completely stumped. In  order for virtual reality to really work wouldn't a subject(a person) need  to be unaware that they were in a &quot;virtual&quot; world. In &quot;The  Matrix&quot; there are members of the group of rebels killed while they are  in The Matrix when they voluntarily return to The Matrix. The problem is  that they are aware that they are in The Matrix. How can computer  controlled bullets and such harm you if you are aware that everything  around you is all just artificially created? As purely entertainment  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is pretty excellent but to provoke any kind of  thought process it doesn't make much sense. For entertainment value there  is a pretty great antagonistic cat and mouse battle between Neo and Agent  Smith, a virus in The Matrix out to kill Neo and steal the mainframe access  code from Morpheus for the last human city outside of the clutches of The  Matrix. Agent Smith says his life is empty and that secret information  would let him cease to exist.(Its worth the price of admission to watch  them battle it out) All in all &quot;The Matrix&quot; needs its harddrive  to be defragmented. The various pieces don't fit that well together and  should have at least been coherent enough to fit together. The ending is  very disappointing. Watch out for the &quot;I love you&quot; so you can now  wake from the dead Neo and Trinity moment.(Trinity, an important part of  the rebel squad, a take charge woman, falls in love with Neo for no  particular reason than it was destined by the Oracle, and pulls off a  reverse &quot;Snow White&quot;) What the heck was that?(I thought when I  saw it)Ask yourself, what is &quot;The Matrix&quot;? Love it, like it as I  did, or hate it, but realize it doesn't make much sense.	3.0	The Matrix's Harddrive Needs To Be Defragmented	2000-07-19	4	0	4

We don't need to wait and see if it lasts another 20 or 30 years.  Let's hope it isn't pulled out that long anyway, look what happened to Star Wars.  The great thing about it is that it is not just eye-candy.  It is what we have all been waiting for- sci-fi that makes you think.  The only downside is that I am tired of people being confused by it.  Sure, maybe it is a complicated movie, but please pay attention.

0790745399	The Matrix	A19NY9T9EXAGNV	Ryan Baltazar	"One fine day, I decided to have a break from my usual routine. I was thinking then, ""where will I go?"". Out of nowhere, i found myself buying my plane ticket off to Amazon City, described by others as ""The city that never sleeps"". Hearing good things about the city, curiosity immensely grew from my head. And I told myself, I've got to see that place as soon as possible. Now here I am, lining in queue along with the others, passing security checks, hoping to see it as we get off the ground aboard an airbus.As we reached the tarmac of the airport, a shuttle bus is waiting on the side of the runway. As we walk down the stairs of the plane, I felt the excitement with the air passing through my skin. Gasping some breath, ""this is it!"" I told myself. And the shuttle bus made its way to Veniz Hotel, my temporary home away from home. I took a room at the 10th floor, hoping to have a bird's eyeview of the whole city. As I unpack my things from my luggage, I felt hungry from a two (2) hour plane ride. I left my room and decided to have a walk, to look for some place to eat in. As I was standing at the hotel's lobby, a bellboy asked me if I wanted a taxi ride. And I said ""no, thank you. I'll just walk to have the feel of being in a strange city"" and I left.From the hotel, I walked to my right as I read the street sign that says, TO TARGET MALL===>. After ten (10) mins. of walking, at last, I got a glimpse of the mall. And there, I had my late lunch in an italian diner. The food was great, ambience is good and the best thing, all in a reasonable price. After an hour, I went out to have my cigar break, and I saw this park across Target Mall. I was astounded to see these stalls selling different items. I wasn't able to refuse the urge of buying somethings for myself. With all those plastic bags of goods I bought, I took a taxi ride back to the hotel. As I was having coffee at the hotel's cafe, I asked the waiter if he knows a bar that I could visit after dinner. And he said, ""I know a place sir, it's the Suth bar, located at Appetite St. cor. Wellness St. just after you pass the Amazon Hospital. Wellness St. is at the northside of the hospital (hospital's main entrance is at EDR St.)"".As soon as I finished my dinner, I took a cab and told him to bring me to Suth bar. On our way to the bar, I saw this building full of lights on its facade, and I realized it was the City Hall of Amazon. Great lights, I told myself. We turn left on Amazon Ave. where I saw this huge fountain located at the heart of the city. We pass along the Public Library, and adjacent to the city hall is the famous St. Peter's Cathedral. It was beautifully structured, with those life-size statues guarding the whole cathedral, not to mention those lights that were giving its panoramic view to its best. From Amazon Ave., on the east side of the church, we turn right on Appetite St. and it took us five (5) mins. to get to Suth bar. And I enjoyed my night in that resto bar, what a night!At around 9 a.m., my cell phone rang and it was my boss! He was asking me to report that day because of some important matters. I told him I was on leave, and I'm far from home. He begged and promised to give me a vacation with pay after I settle his concerns. Not bad, I thought. I packed my things and hopped to a cab. I told the cab driver to take me to St. Peter's Cathedral to pay visit before we go to the airport. And that's the only vacation I had last year. Hoping to come back this year without my cell phone."	5.0	katangahan	2007-10-30	2	2	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A3AKPY4LXIC24O	Ryan Costantino	I first saw The Matrix when everybody else did and I must say I wasn't nearly affected by it the way most people I know were.  Here's why.  The idea of the world not being what it really seems is not new.  The idea of Kanoe Reeves (&lt;-purposely misspelled) being a savior of any sorts is down right infuriating, it's like entrusting your salvation to a piece of driftwood riddled with knotholes.  The friggin' acting is well, pretty darn bad.  However, the movie has grown on me, and I did like some things about it.The special fx of course were crazy intense, as were the fight scenes.  The set design was sweet and the overall look of the movie definitely portrayed the Wachowski Bros. stark vision of a post-apocalyptic world run by machines.Here we get into another problem, anybody seen The Terminator?  Star Wars?  Then you'll notice things that you've seen in other movies trying to be passed off as fresh and original here.  Now this is a movie, and formulaic recognition gets things greenlighted by studios.  That's fine, I accept that, just don't lie by saying we've never seen this before.  It's an old story told in a new way.  Period.  So, the bottom line is this.  The Matrix is entertaining, granted.  Amazing technically, absolutely.  Life changing, hardly.  Maybe for those who wish their computers were sentient beings so they could abandon the harsh reality of the world this is the mecca of sci-fi.  For those of us non-computer geeks it's merely a popcorn film, with really slow bullets.P.S.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1SIEFJ2952YGX	Ryan McShane	Here are my top ten reasons why this movie is so unbelievably perfect:1. The movie makes you believe that the human race today could  actually exist as a matrix.2. The fight scenes are magnificently  impressive that they make you quiver.3. The actors all fit their parts  perfectly.4. Superior cast: Keanu Reeves whom is also in  The Devil's  Advocate and Speed as(Neo,Mr. Anderson), Lawrence Fishburne whom was in  Event Horizon and Boys N the Hood as(Morpheus).5. The storyline is  perfect.  Neo, a man who lives in a dreamworld, is pulled out of his  original setting to see the truth.  Morpheus, the leader of the rebels,  guides Neo.  He has an ultimate belief that Neo  is the one that can save  the rest of the human race.6. The picture's directing is extremely well  done.7. The quality of the picture, the special effects, and the good  acting brings realness to the viewer.8. Believeable as if it were  non-fiction.9. Stunts never seen before in american movies.10. Humans  prevail upon their own creations.It's sooooooooo inspiring that two  sequels are spawning from it, and each one still has Keanu Reeves(great  actor)!	5.0	You can see this movie ten times and never get tired of it!	2000-07-12	24	12	12

But the Matrix is still very entertaining, fun to watch, and it did make me think.The opening scene is great. Action, action, and some more action, plus that awesome little spinning-camera thing with Trinity's kick. I love that part.We move on to Neo, played by Keanu Reeves. Stop picking on Keanu! Sure, maybe he's a dolt, but he did a decent job in the Matrix (and he's hot!). Yet another fun spinning camera shot, this one just spiraling over Neo instead of circling around him while the action freezes like the first one. Long sentence.Agent Smith is hysterically deranged. One of my favorite scenes is -- well, I won't spoil it, but it involves water. Snigger. Morpheus kicks derriere (literally); the fighting scene between him and Neo is great.The film gets violenter as it goes, going from a more thoughtful sci-fi film to a nice and violent action movie. But that's not a bad thing.The alleged religiousity of the Matrix is up to you: ignore it or embrace it. I ignored it -- didn't even really notice it until other people pointed it out. Some people complained about the greenish tint, but that was done intentionally to make it seem like there was something wrong with the world; the sky is never blue for the same reason because blue is ""too happy"". I don't know. I don't really mind the green-ness.Neo's cute, Morpheus is cool, Trinity rocks, Agent Smith is my favorite character aside from spoon-boy... , and Cypher...well, I can understand his point.

Then he meets Morpheus who tells him that the world that he knows is actually a dream world made by evil machines who years ago took over the world and enslaved human beings.

He is just a normal guy, that works, but the agents want him for some reason.  When he decides to join Morpheus and his gang, he realizes how hard, strange, difficult, and unbeliveble the truth can be.Morpheus:He has been serching all his life for Neo, whom he belives is the one.  He is the leader of a crew that goes up agenst the odds in the real world and the vurtual world.  Altho he's doinf quite good, his crew keeps on dying to agents, in the computer world.  But the crutial question is this: is Neo really the one?It took a real long time for me to get into the movie.  This movie really didn't have a plot, and it took so long to finally see some action, which was why I gave the movie 4 stars for starting slow, but ending with a bang.  If you love sci-fi, then by all means, check this out, but if you love action, just expect to sit through the first hour, whaching nothing but talking.	4.0	Very good sci-fi, needed more action, and more of a plot	2003-05-21	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	ARYU7OQRFP6T5	SAM BARRACLOUGH	An exeptional Science Fiction movie needs to provide many key aspects, many of which the Matrix has forfilled.  One of the key qualities the movie owns is a storyline which is not only unique and original but  captures the imagination of the audience.The action scenes of course  provide the basis of the movie,and although this is a common fault of the  modern film industry, fantastic technology and correography back this up.  To sum up this  still does not compare to the all time greatest sci -fi  film of 2001 but is worth a watch	4.0	Generally good with an exeptional storyline	2000-02-08	2	1	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A13910TC3NZ6LE	Sam Bethune	I'm not a big sci-fi fan, and I always thought that other sci-fi cult classics like &quot;Stargate&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; were highly overrated.  But having seen this motion picture, I have to say I'm very  impressed.If you're into technical and special effects, they just don't  get any better than they do in &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  No question as to  why this motion picture won as many technical Oscars as it did...eat your  heart out, Lucas and Spielberg!The reason I refer to this movie as a  &quot;thinking person's sci-fi movie&quot; is that some will have a tough  time following the plot.  This is a picture to which you MUST pay attention  to understand.I would have given this movie five stars instead of  four, but I thought that Keanu Reeves' acting performance was a little more  wooden than usual.  Laurence Fishburn, on the other hand, has never been  better.  I also thought Joe Pantoliano was a questionable casting decision  as the turncoat, but it didn't distract all that much from my enjoyment of  this motion picture.&quot;The Matrix&quot; is one of those pictures that  sort of raises the bar for others of its genre.  I understand a sequel is  in the works, and I believe I won't wait for it to come out on home video  this time.	4.0	A Thinking Person's Sc-Fi Movie	2000-04-10	2	1	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A12G7DZ8WZ6IR	Sam S.	The Matrix is one of those films that will have you intrigued from start to finish. Along with action packed mind blowing sequences it offers a mysterious and intersting storyline that is very gripping. The only problem with the Matrix is that the story line can be hard to understand at first, but give it another watch it's well worth understanding.	5.0	One of the best SCI FI action films ever made	2004-09-04	2	1	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A3I3J7WAJ31BEU	Samuel Deacon	"""The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.""""What truth?""That ""The Matrix"" is a brilliant film. You put in the DVD, and immediately you are confronted with a fast moving montage of the best bits of the movie. You could sit and watch the menu for two hours, or you could watch the film. What I thought before watching the movie was that it was just another sci-fi movie with nothing I hadn't seen before. I was wrong. Very, very wrong.The beginning is a bit slow moving, but you need to hang in there to fully appreciate the rest of the film.The film follows the story of Thomas A. Anderson or his hacker alias Neo. He is just like you or me until he is contacted by Morpheus. He explains to Neo how where he lives is actually a computer generated dream world sent into our brains by machines who need our energy to survive. The Matrix is that dream world. Neo is apparently able to remake the Matrix as he sees fit, and the movie is about how he discovers his abilities.Neo is played by Keanu Reeves, who spent four months learning kung fu for the movie. It really does make for great viewing.But what stands out the most are the amazing special effects. I'm talking about bullet time. The camera spins around Neo as he dodges bullets in super slow motion. The explosions, the camera effects as the camera zooms through computer screens, allowing us to see inside the screen, it's all amazing.Another dimension to the film is the score, by Don Davis. It is great by itself but adds mood and mysteriousness to the movie. Also, the soundtrack is great, from Rage Against The Machine (The end of the film where Neo hangs up the phone) to the Propellerheads (The shoot-out scene in the lobby of the Government building).So the film is breathtaking, but it doesn't stop there. Back in 1999, the release of the DVD transformed how DVDs were to be made. It had tons of special features, hidden special effects documentaries, and a great DVD-ROM feature that allowed you to access interviews, games, exclusive websites and more. Even today it rises above many other DVDs in terms of special features. And if that isn't enough, a double disc DVD is available with even more features.The film is rated 15, but there isn't really anything there that's too bad for older children. If anything, it appeals more to younger people.So if you're thinking of buying this DVD, there's no point in thinking about it. Go ahead and buy it. It is a film that gets better every time you watch it, and you will need to watch it again to notice everything in the film. It is essential to anyone's DVD collection.""Why do my eyes hurt?""""You've never used them before..."""	5.0	The Matrix - Definitive DVD Review	2003-05-23	1	1	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A3FGJDBSMCSG7G	Sam Vaknin	In the visually tantalizing movie, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, a breed of AI computers takes over the world. It harvests human embryos in laboratories called &quot;fields&quot;. It then feeds them through grim looking tubes and keeps them immersed in gelatinous liquid in cocoons. This new &quot;machine species&quot; derives its energy needs from the electricity produced by the billions of human bodies thus preserved. A sophisticated, all-pervasive, computer program called &quot;The Matrix&quot; generates a &quot;world&quot; inhabited by the consciousness of the unfortunate human batteries. Ensconced in their shells, they see themselves walking, talking, working and making love. This is a tangible and olfactory phantasm masterfully created by the Matrix. Its computing power is mind boggling. It generates the minutest details and reams of data in a spectacularly successful effort to maintain the illusion.A group of human miscreants succeeds to learn the secret of the Matrix. They form an underground and live aboard a ship, loosely communicating with a halcyon city called &quot;Zion&quot;, the last bastion of resistance. In one of the scenes, Cypher, one of the rebels defects. Over a glass of (illusory) rubicund wine and (spectral) juicy steak, he poses the main dilemma of the movie. Is it better to live happily in a perfectly detailed delusion - or to survive unhappily but free of its hold?The Matrix controls the minds of all the humans in the world. It is a bridge between them, they inter-connected through it. It makes them share the same sights, smells and textures. They remember. They compete. They make decisions. The Matrix is sufficiently complex to allow for this apparent lack of determinism and ubiquity of free will. The root question is: is there any difference between making decisions and feeling certain of making them (not having made them)? If one is unaware of the existence of the Matrix, the answer is no. From the inside, as a part of the Matrix, making decisions and appearing to be making them are identical states. Only an outside observer - one who in possession of full information regarding both the Matrix and the humans - can tell the difference.Moreover, if the Matrix were a computer program of infinite complexity, no observer (finite or infinite) would have been able to say with any certainty whose a decision was - the Matrix's or the human's. And because the Matrix, for all intents and purposes, is infinite compared to the mind of any single, tube-nourished, individual - it is safe to say that the states of &quot;making a decision&quot; and &quot;appearing to be making a decision&quot; are subjectively indistinguishable. No individual within the Matrix would be able to tell the difference. His or her life would seem to him or her as real as ours are to us. The Matrix may be deterministic - but this determinism is inaccessible to individual minds because of the complexity involved. When faced with a trillion deterministic paths, one would be justified to feel that he exercised free, unconstrained will in choosing one of them. Free will and determinism are indistinguishable at a certain level of complexity.Yet, we KNOW that the Matrix is different to our world. It is NOT the same. This is an intuitive kind of knowledge, for sure, but this does not detract from its firmness. If there is no subjective difference between the Matrix and our Universe, there must be an objective one. Another key sentence is uttered by Morpheus, the leader of the rebels. He says to &quot;The Chosen One&quot; (the Messiah) that it is really the year 2199, though the Matrix gives the impression that it is 1999.This is where the Matrix and reality diverge. Though a human who would experience both would find them indistinguishable - objectively they are different. In one of them (the Matrix), people have no objective TIME (though the Matrix might have it). The other (reality) is governed by it.Sam Vaknin, author of &quot;Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited&quot;.	5.0	The Matrix of Reality	2001-03-16	6	2	4

0790745399	The Matrix	A3Q9QLCTD7W37X	S. A. Poarch	This is one of the best sci fi movies you will ever see.. It can be viewed and appreciated on a dozen different levels. The story, editing, and cinematography are all stellar, and the special effects are second to none.The storyline and plot are way out there... but the film is carried off well enough that the viewer has no problem suspending disbelief. But on a completely different level you can go back and watch the film just to check out the incredible camera work and editing. The sets and wardrobe combine to create a sort-of postmodern, neo-apocalyptic cool. The soundtrack is very well matched to the action/feel of the film. The fight scenes are nothing short of jaw-dropping, especially considering the fact that most include Lawrence Fishburn and/or Keanu Reaves neither of whom are world-class kung fu masters (There ARE a dozen or so real life Kung Fu masters in the credits so I'm sure there was some stand-in action going on... but it is very smoothly done). Fishburn is awesome as &quot;Morpheus&quot; and really carries a lot of the plot development... Reaves is a little &quot;cardboard-ish&quot; in places but has really come a long way from &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot;. If you are looking for some escapist brainless action, see this. If you are looking to have your mind blown by an incredible story with fatastic effects, see this. If you are looking for a masterpiece of the cinematographer's art... see this... but above all SEE THIS MOVIE!Oh, by the way...  Is somebody on your list getting a dvd player from Santa?

After it had ended, I had known that it was pretty good, but I still felt like I had  missed something.  After just seeing it a second time on DVD, I can say  that I understand it a lot better.  I'm more of a fan of the first half  than the second half of the movie though because the first half was more  involving and thought-provoking in my opinion.  The acting by all is good  and the special effects are excellent.  The Matrix is not a classic, but it  no doubt is still quite cool.  Worth a watch.	3.0	Cerebral and fast-paced.	1999-11-30	13	9	4

Normally I am not a fan of science fiction or action but this film caught my attention with its underlying existential plot. It goes far beyond gunfights and the latest Hollywood special affects. There is really something to grasp and hold on to in THE MATRIX far after the movie has ended. In preparation for the release of the sequel today I purchased this DVD to refresh my memory.

As my son said, when Neo wakes up in  the jello-bath, &quot;This just hit about a 9.5 on my Weird-O-Meter!&quot;  The plot definitely offers one some food for thought, the dialog between  man and machine when the agent unplugs his earpiece and has a little  tete-a-tete with Morpheus was quite interesting.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2I7ZAB04Q0DML	Scott Kolecki	"Neo has been looking for something.  He doesn't know what, but he knows there is something not right with the world he lives in.  By day, he is a computer programmer, working for a faceless corporation, by night he sells illegal ""narcotic"" software, living in a concealed world while searching for something more.It all changes when he meets Morphius and discovers that his world, that everything he has always questioned, is nothing more than an elaborate matrix developed by a computer technology that long ago took control of the world.  The balance of the story becomes Neo's quest for understanding, as he learns to go beyond the boundaries set by the matrix and struggles for the freedom of mankind.This is one of the most stylized films I have ever seen.  It is at once dark, sleek, paranoid, lavish, lush and abysmal.  The world that is created in this film is so completely convincing, that moviegoers will be mesmerized by its epic style of storytelling and subtle blending of reality with the computer generated fantasy that Neo, Morphius and Trinity move through, while fighting to gain supremacy over the machines.The story itself is a common theme.  Technology gains the upper hand on humanity and takes control.  However, unlike so many of these stories, the Matrix goes beyond the simple narrative and instead pushes our limits to accept what we see as real, only to remove the veil and leave us pondering our own perceptions of reality.Filmed with state-of-the-art cameras, the special film effects are incredible.  At one point, early in the film, Trinity is confronted by an entourage of police officers.  As she fights for her freedom, she raises into the air, and as though frozen in time, the camera moves impossibly around her.For those who have seen this film, the forementioned scene, and others like it are explained in the ""making of"" portion of the DVD.  Packed with many extras, the DVD will take you into the world of the Matrix and introduce you to the first installment of a film franchise which has been elevated by moviegoers around the world to something akin to a religious experience.So, enter the Matrix if you dare.  You won't be disappointed."	5.0	The Matrix Is One Hell Of A Ride	2003-11-05	11	9	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A2YZUFRTBTMSHR	Scott Tam	Sorry pardon my use of profanity. Okay first of Matrix is NOT all that great. It is not original, the fighting scenes are overrated, and the characters sucked.My points:Originality: Like I said Not Original, the writers ripped it off of some Japanese anime like Ghost in the Shell. Some of the parts are cliched like the part where Trinity tells Neo that its &quot;Impossible&quot; then pulls it off, and the part where Neo meets the Oracle and it is expected that Neo meets someone very mystical and stuff but he meets a seemingly normal person but isn't that type of irony somewhat cliched?Fighting Scenes: I hate it when I hear my friends say how innovative the fight scenes were. First of all: Fights like that has been done LONG before the Matrix got on the drawing board and they were done better. Martial Arts movies like &quot;The Iron Monkey&quot;, &quot;Fong Sai Yok&quot;, and the Wong Fei Houng Movies done it YEARS before Matrix.Characters: First of all, its Keauna Reeves. Second no depth (but I guess that will have to be excused because this is an Action/Sci-Fi flick if I wanted depth I would have picked &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;:)) Neo could have been a cooler character like Ash from the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; movies but instead he spends most of his time being stupid (now that was a bias statement on my part sorry).Graphics: Hmmm.......Great Graphics nothing to complain about here.Movie Overall: I guess I WOULD have liked it better if everybody didn't make such a big deal out of it.*sigh* oh well thats just my opinion on this movie everyone's tastes are different.	2.0	Oh My Friggin' God...........	2001-01-15	16	4	12

It is not until he is ""unplugged"" that he discovers he has been living in a dream world. He uncovers the gruesome truth that the Matrix was plugged into his brain and was sending images to make him believe that life existed as it was.

0790745399	The Matrix	A17OLBSLMHFBEP	"S. Dickler ""dpd89"""	The Matrix is no doubt one of the best movies of it's time, with in your face action and awsome special effects you could and will want to watch it over and over again.Unless you have been living under a rock you would know the general premise  of it so there isnt any need for me to say it. Exept for the fact that it blows you away every time you watch it with new hidden meanings and forshadowing, which I would watch it just for.Anyway lets talk about the acting.  Keanu Reeves { Neo} acually did a great job.  Now before you just skip over this reveiw because you think im being overly enthusiastic just read for one more second..... People critize him for being &quot; wooden&quot; and not showing much emotion, and that he doesn't seem like anything special { which I TOTALLY disagree with, but thats besides the point} well thats why why he is soooo PERFECT for this role, he is suposed to look confussed and guarded during the film, which is why i give the casting so much credit, as well as Keanu  because lets face it, could you see brad pitt or will smith now as Neo?  So I really believe he deserves more credit then what fans and critics have given him.Anyway where was I, Lawrence Fishbourrne, he was great in the part of Morph. He was very confident,  in a good way, but he was also able to put lots of emotion into the easily dense part of &quot;the captain&quot;.Finally we come to the runaway hit of the matrix....... Carrie Anne Moss.  She was beautiful, strong, kick ass, emotional, simply wonderful.  Every time I watch it I'm blown away by the presence she has, it's not a big over blown one, just you always want her on the screen { and not just because she is beautiful}.  By the way, if you liked her in this you should definatly check her out in Memento, which is my second favorite movie behind  this.So basically what im saying is Screw lord of the rings, buy the MATRIX and of couse it's sequels but thats for another  review.	5.0	You don't gotta be the one to see this movie	2003-12-24	0	0	0

Is there fate or is there freewill?This is a really complex question that is not easy to answer. The Matrix trilogy really attacks this question head-on and it never really leaves you with a definite answer. It makes you really think about everything that you have ever seen or done in your life and it leaves you with so many moral and philosophical questions. The people that hate the Matrix movies hate it because they can only see what is on the surface. They see people in funny black costumes flying around doing kung-fu. They don't ever see how deep and philosophical the films (or the characters) truly are.I appreciate the Matrix and the Matrix sequels because they truly are the ""thinking-man's"" action films. The people that like The Matrix and dislike the sequels aren't really the true fans. They fail to see ""how deep the rabbit hole truly goes.""I think The Matrix series is THE BEST Sci-Fi/Fantasy series ever. I think it's deeper than the Star Wars or Lord of the Rings films will ever be.This film is the film that started it all. Buy it and it will truly open your mind.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3TD5IV1HUG7M	Sean Patterson	The Matrix is pure fluff with some style. Granted, the special effects were great, but the plot loopholes are just too much to take. For instance, why do supposed &quot; freedom fighters &quot; kill innocent human SWAT  members? How can Keannu destroy an entire office floor and hit everything  except a sitting-still Fishburne? Why would a computer create &quot; agents  &quot; and give them less than perfect aim?  The plot is nothing new and  occasionally lapses into gibberish. It's a shame that people are calling  this the future of sci-fi. If you ask me, I would much rather watch good  sci-fi like 2001 and Alien. Do yourselves a favor and watch a show like The  Outer Limits for better sci-fi on a way smaller budget.	2.0	There's better sci-fi out there	1999-12-17	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A184CI1GIWVE6H	Servina Pub	The Matrix - The Warchowski BrothersStupendous special effects and placing Keanu Reeves in the right place at the right time  save this film from its insubstantial biblical plot.The plot centres around creeping late twentieth century paranoia about technology, apocalypse and the idea that the human race will eventually destroy itself through too much evolution.  You could even say that this is the film to watch for late twentieth century ideas about the future.The world has been taken over by Artificial Intelligence.  A situation brought on by the arrogance and irresponsibility of the human race and it is up to Neo (Reeves' character) to save it with the help of the inmates of the Nebuchadnezzer.  I say inmates because Nebuchadnezzer was sent insane by God for his arrogance (see where I'm going with the biblical plot).So, in this gigantic floating lunatic asylum, or ship of fools if you like, live Neos' love interest Trinity, his guide/mentor Morpheus and an arch enemy called Cifer. They set about saving the human race from marauding PC's with true Hollywood win/win heroism.The action is skillfully maneuvered and shot with groundbreaking use of film technology.  The fight scenes are not to be missed with choreography from Yuen Wo Ping. keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss perform fantastically in exhilarating interpretations of martial arts and the sentient matrix is horrific on an extraterrestrial scale.As an action film The Matrix is scintillating to say the least, it's definitely one of the most surprising and visual masterpieces made to date.  The Warchowski Brothers have shown the world what they're made of.	3.0	Glossy thriller capturing late twentieth century fear	2001-09-26	3	1	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A1ENLVC8JFEWEX	Seth Chavez	What can I say that hasn't been already been said about The Matrix? It truly is a one of a kind film for the sci-fi and cyberpunk genre. That's why for this I am sticking to strictly the Blu-Ray and it's product quality. This disc is full of special features including intriguing features including, behind the scenes making, visual effects, Directors' commentary and many more. The film has been remaster from the original 35mm prints and has been upgraded to 1080p and 5.1 surround for the best film experience. The picture is just as clear as ever with this remaster and the sound is so crisp, I was able to hear every gunshot in crisp detail during the famous lobby shootout. All these scenes pop and it feels so good to see a classic given the proper BR treatment and for the right price.

I liked it the first time when it was called Star Wars, or Alice and Wonderland, or even THE BIBLE.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Laurence Fishburne, he was a bad mother; shut your mouth.  The special effects don't really do it for me either.  The idea of several cameras set up to capture a fluid action isn't a new one. This was the whole idea behind the advent of the motion picture camera, so just get over it people please.  There are so many other quality pictures out there so just pick those up instead.

The premise is extremely thought-provoking ... that we live in a world that isn't really what we believe it to be. There are plenty of spiritual connotations here about rebirth, seeing things for what they really are, etc. While I'm not a big fan of Keanu Reeves (really don't think he's all that great of an actor), his deer-in-the-headlights performance worked well for his character.

0790745399	The Matrix	A20DE0ATVAET2B	"Shawn ""djsaint"""	"...is the exceptional sound design. Understandibly, everyone is captivated by the visual effects and the conceptual genius of this movie, but The Matrix has one of the finest sound designs I have ever experienced in a film. I'm not just talking about the high quality of the sound, I'm talking more about the sheer artistry of the design itself. Instead of constantly overwhealming the viewer/listener with sheer quantity of sounds and loudness, the designers have created a highly refined, artistic soundscape that becomes a character in the film. They pick and choose the important sonic elements we need to hear in order to completely involve us moment-by-moment. The sonic perspective changes constantly. We jump back and forth into the viewpoint of different characters--whichever perspective best emotionally supports the story. We go from an in-your face flurry of bullets and crashes and whooshes and explosions to, within the same scene, a sudden shift to hearing just the sound of one gun's casings dropping on the floor from the point of view of one character. The effect is brilliant.  The film is mixed very well--with a wonderfully dimensional soundstage, great dynamics, clean and clear dialogue and fantastic panning effects. I love the moments when we ""break through"" various video display devices to enter a scene--the sonic detail and 3D effects are wonderful. I also enjoy the imaginative solutions that answer the question of what something not yet invented might sound like. It is obvious a lot of care, thought and artistry went into the sound design, and that a rare synergy of all creative elements was achieved. Sound effects work hand in hand with visuals, dialogue and music to create a totally emmersive experience--a sign that the directors considered sound an important part of the process from the very beginning."	5.0	Often lost in the praise for this movie...	2004-02-13	1	1	0

If you are interested in buying the DVD, you have probably already seen the movie, and been captivated by either the special  effects, or the paradox of virtual reality.This DVD package - which  includes several &quot;making of&quot; documentaries as well as commentary  on the music and special effects - is what a DVD should be.  They allow a  causal viewer to see the movie in the way it was intended, and allow the  fan(atic) to watch what went on behind the scenes.  If you are a music buff  like me, the commentaries on the score are especially cool.  Best of is the  ""white rabbit"" setting, which allows you to view some behind the scene  footage in the context of the movie.  All of the extras are outstanding -  certainly worth the price of the DVD alone.If you loved the Matrix,  get the DVD - even if you don't have a DVD player.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2B7BUH8834Y6M	"Shelley Gammon ""Geek"""	I saw this in the theater with a friend of mine... we had both agreed that the trailers looked pretty cool, but we weren't expecting anything but a few special effects.WOW!Were we ever in for a surprise. This film  totally surpassed my wildest expectations and hopes for an incredible  visual, intellectual and thrilling experience.This movie has the most  incredible special effects you've ever seen... but special effects are  absolutely worthless without a story to back them up and actors that are  convincing enough to make the effects believable. The story is unlike any  you've heard before, but I can't tell much w/o revealing important parts of  the plot... but suffice to say, you will have this film and story on your  mind for several weeks after watching it as it will be hard to get some of  these concepts out of your mind.I have this on DVD and I have watched  the movie at least 20 times at home. It is easily watchable over and over  again. This DVD is feature packed! The cast/crew commentary is enlightening  and the behind-the-scenes featurette shows you how the cast trained and  prepared for 9 months before they even started shooting. Built-in  interactivity allows you to set up the DVD via your remote so that a white  rabbit (&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; reference) blinks on the screen...  you click when you see it and you get to see how the special effects were  created in the exact scene you're watching.  For DVD-ROM players on a  Windows computer, you can view storyboards, the screenplay, games and more,  but sadly, these special DVD-ROM features are not available on the  Macintosh platform. Nonetheless, the movie is watchable on a Mac and the  DVD is still feature-packed when viewed on a standard DVD player.This  movie is not &quot;Speed&quot; or &quot;Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent  Adventure&quot; in space or anything... it is a great concept and story...  and non-stop action. Some movies seem cool at first blush, but when you  start thinking about them after the fact, you start realizing all the holes  in the plot and all the improbabilities. This does not happen with  &quot;The Matrix. &quot; It is an extremely well-thought-out story that  will keep you thinking long after you've seen it.The question the  trailer asks you is, &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot; The movie answers this  question.Believe the hype... this movie will blow you away!	5.0	far more than eye candy, but it is sweet eye candy!	2000-07-12	27	22	5

0790745399	The Matrix	A3GK9LT41X73NC	S. Henkels	"..Buffs who parade ideas of a ""Slave Society"" controlled by ominous, malefactors pulling strings..In this respect, this film is outright harmful in that this propaganda may be taken too seriously by some. The story line is detailed in the Amazon blurb,though those reviews seem a little too starry eyed. The best scene is the very first where the Moss character plays a cyberpunk version of Supergirl, dodging and flying all over the big city to evade her bad guy pursuers. Notice how the city scape is populated by suit and tie robots, and the triplet bad-guys are all dressed in their oliver green suit/tie combos,never smiling, with the always obligatory sunglasses. Whereas the wonderful cyber-heroes in their black leather outfits, earrings, and bald heads are the masters of the universe. How about a little less stereotyping for gosh sake?! The special effects are good, as are the kung fu tournaments, but the generally vapid and unpleasant characters are in need of some energy,with the sole exception of Moss' character, the only one with personality, not to mention acceptable looks. There are some vertigo inspiring skyscraper shots of the city,which seems to be Chicago, though the landscape here changes a bit perhaps to represent other cityscapes where the ""robots"" roam antlike thruout. There's a little mythology thrown in to give it some ""intellectual"" clout, though this is mainly embarrassing,except for the very young. And there is more than enough gratuitous violence,the worst being the casual shootem-up in the lobby where Reeves and Moss characters are having a real fun time blowing away the innocent,lazy security guards. What a ball!!! Not to mention the helicopter crash near the top of a skyscraper, not pretty after 9/11...For about 20 minutes of special effects, it may be worth seeing...To think this received over 2370 reviews on [Amazon.com]. And was the top [dollar] grosser of 1999. Anyway, several cuts above ""American Beauty"", the Academy Award winner of that dismal year in motion pictures. PS- Sure there are many similar sci-fi films over the years. I suggest the much better and way-underrated ""Tron"" from the early 1980's, a similar story without the ""punk"" look, more interesting effects,and no cheap gratuitous violence."	3.0	Of  Little Note other than special effects, for conspiracy..	2002-01-22	8	1	7

I hate using descriptions like &quot;a must have DVD&quot; or the &quot;one of the best DVDs ever made&quot;, but in the case of the Matrix, these comments may well be appropriate.The Matrix is a story that takes place in a post apocalyptic future where machines rule the earth and keep the majority of humanity complacently asleep in a virtual reality 20th century world.  A small band of rebels, lead by the enigmatic Morpheous, cross back and forth between the real world and virtual reality in search of &quot;the one&quot; who will help them understand the secret of the Matrix and finally free humanity.The Matrix takes a very original premise and executes it brilliantly.  It manages to maintain a fairly complex plot while interleaving great action sequences and some fantastic special effects.  There are strong performances by Laurence Fishburn (Morpheous) and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith), who contribute heavily to the film.  Even Keanu Reeves provides a respectable showing as a major character, Neo.  The films played heavily to his strengths ... basically he dresses up in cool trendy clothes and looks good.While some of the techniques used in the film are not new to either Hollywood (see Blade) or any of the Hong Kong actions films, a great many new types of effects were created for the film.  The visual effects and overall &quot;look&quot; of the film are incredibly well designed.  Most importantly, the special effects are used to complement the plot and keep the pace of the movie going, they do not replace the plot like so many other big budget FX movies.  This is the best part of owning the DVD.  When using the &quot;white rabbit&quot; option, you can jump in and out of the movie to see how particular sequences were filmed.  I do not own another DVD that integrates the special materials this effectively.The special edition DVD did not really offer much new material, I am not sure why you would want the special edition over the original DVD, other than a celluloid film strip.Hip, stylish and trend defining, this movies has strong performances, interesting storyline, great acting and fantastic DVD extras.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2AN988COWP49T	Shiragami Hiromi	In the Matrix world, people live lives of virtual reality of materialism. In  greal h reality, you are one of the generator fs cell dreaming everything but having nothing material.People are grown and when their bodies come to generate nothing e.g. die, are simply disposed of. It can be said that the management is perfectly rational and, may be some people would say;  gWhy not? h, like Cypher did. After all, many people do not even know they live and die in the matrix world as something (not a human being) that the Matrix can use at its disposal. So, why should they not keep dozing in the virtual-material world?Now, what I believe is that we are born to this irrational, unequal and can-be-very-violent world in order to make our souls better, lighter and shinier ones.So, one question here is: can you discipline your soul in the Matrix fs virtual reality?I believe the answer is  gNo h.That is why the  gawakened h should help people get themselves out of the Matrix and fight back against its invincible power, even though  gawakening h from the dream world of the Matrix means to re-born into the shabby and hopeless, thus, can-be-so-depressing real world.The good news is that: if you realize that there is actually no material world around you, you can release yourself from the physical rules of the Matrix world and can change  gvirtually h everything with your free-will and, therefore, can live in freedom in spiritual sense. In the film  gthe Matrix h it is only  gthe One h who can do that, but, I think, everyone may have the potential to be Neo.Release yourself from the Matrix of your bodily limitations. Be Neo. Be free. Then all sufferings and agony will be gone ferever.	5.0	Illussory Material World: the Matrix	2004-04-15	1	1	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A1915LOZNSLTIU	Shiva (SHIVA769@aol.com	The Matrix is a must see movie for many reasons. Keanu Reeves outdoes himself in this one, as does Laurence Fishburne. But the one we really need to pay attention to in the future is Carrie Anne Moss. Her portrayal of  Trinity was both strong and vulnerable at the same time. The brothers have  done it again. The FX were superior and didn't overtake the movie. Watching  some parts of the movie I found myself holding my breath or gripping the  arm rests! I'm actually going to see the movie for the 10th time this  evening and I'm looking forward to it as much as I did the 1st time. I  can't wait! If you have a chance to buy this movie, please do so.

Morpheus plays a sort of ""father"" figure to Neo, and the third member of the ""godhead"" is Trinity, who becomes Neo's love interest.  .... Great movie, great action.

I've seen lots of Sci-fi/action movies, this one  is just not up to its reputation. The exitements and mistyrius built up  from the beginning and peak up to climax within the first 30 minutes of the  film, then it started to decline, then some boring scences came in. Also  2-3 times, there were dialoques that made me expected that the good stuffs  might come up. Then the movies ended. The movie is not too short but I  think they organized the story poorly. Don't know who to blame, but this  movie could be better, really.Oh, one more thing, Keanu Reeve never  looks better (since he had relatively less lines to speak).	3.0	Could be better	2000-04-12	1	0	1

This film has a story line that I had a hard time believing in, and I can't even say that the acting of Keanu Reeves made the film any better. I have never really been impressed with Reeves abilities, but I am less impressed now that ever.I loved the special effects though. They were spectacullar. I found myself rewinding the action packed scenes for a second go-round. The effets themselves probably could have made up for an actors short-comings, unless of course the acting was of an extrodinarly low caliber, such as was the case with Reeves.As I said I forced myself to give a 4 star rating. That is because the special effects were wonderful and the other actors and actresses have a fair amount of talent. The story line, although I wasn't convinced it could happen because there were to many open ends, was very orginal.

"For many, ""The Matrix"" is great special effects and great science fiction, which it undoubtedly is, and undoubtedly one of the best of the genre, but it is much more than that.The Matrix is a spot-on science fiction analogy and metaphor for the manufactured and bogus reality (or ""Matrix"") that Americans are trapped in.  The Matrix is a created artificial reality that is so well-done that actual reality is completely concealed.  In the movie's Matrix and in the real (?) world , sometimes there is a ""glitch"" in the perception of ""reality"" that alerts a member of the Matrix that something is wrong with reality as they know it.  Neo (Keanu Reeves) pierces the computer-created reality and fights the ""agents"" that are the enforcers of the artificial intelligence that is exploiting humans (using them as organic batteries) and using the created reality of the Matrix to conceal their reality of exploitation.  This, of course, is easily analogized to using a media created reality enforced by various corporate agents to conceal their victims' similar exploitation as organic profit generators.The Matrix is a milestone in moviemaking, special effects, fantastic action sequences, and use of an intelligent and imaginative science fiction plot to convey a message...a classic must-see movie."	5.0	Is it real or is it Matrix?	2009-10-10	3	1	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A26A64X86VL1R4	Snowbrocade	The Matrix is a ground-breaking movie created by the talented Wachowski brothers. These two brothers share, along with their creative collaboration, a love of sci-fi, comic books and kung fu movies.  The plot of the movie is existential; the heroes live in a world where people believe they are living real lives but in fact are living within a computer program.  Their physical bodies are harvested in order to feed the machines who have taken over the world.  Resistance fighters who are aware of this domination by the machines fight back by entering the simulated world and deconstructing it.  In essence, mental fortitude is the key to defeating the Matrix.  The world is constructed by thought.Lawrence Fishburne brings a mysterious and sexy paternalism to his portrayal of Morpheus, the leader of the resistance.  Keanu Reaves does an outstanding job as Neo the computer geek turned freedom fighter.  There is an excellent supporting cast.The Wachowski brothers brought in the master Wu Ping, who had created martial artist action sequences for many Hong King martial arts films.  Wu Ping had the actors attend a sort of martial arts boot camp for three months prior to the making of the movie, so that the actors could be used for most of the special effects sequences.  The actors also had extensive weapons training to lend verisimilitude to their handling of guns in the fight sequences.  This kind of perfectionist artistic vision is what has created the masterpiece that is the Matrix, which I believe is one of the best movies of the 1990's.	5.0	A groundbreaking film--one of the best of the 1990's.	2006-08-02	3	3	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A1M85899V6KV3K	"""snowytrails"""	This is a movie packed with action, suspense, special effects, and a great storyline that basically hasn't been told before.  Plus it has a spiritual undertone which makes it a movie I can recommend to my Chrisitian friends.  For an R: rated movie, is has a welcome lack of distracting sex and foul language.The movie basically parallels the reality that we are spiritual beings &quot;plugged&quot; into a physical world.  What we see happening around is temporal and might as well not exist.  All the passions are worldy pursuits and distractions from what is really going on in the spiritual dimension.  What is really happening in the spiritual realm is scary...we often don't even what to know.  We would rather live inside the Matrix and take the bittersweet fantasy than deal with the sobering reality that we are eternal beings and that our eternal destiny hangs on what happens in our mortal, physical lives.  Even if you were killed in the fantasy world of the Matrix, you're real person died too, much like how if you die in your physical life without knowing your Saviour, you die in the spiritual world.The development of Neo's (the lead character who basically plays the &quot;Savior&quot;) abilities and skills mimic the development of faith in our lives and our ability to see the spiritual and not the physical.  By building his faith, he was eventually able to takes his eyes off what he was seeing and see behind it.  He then began to defy the rules becuase he was no longer bound by it.  Jesus said that if we had the faith the size of a mustard seed we could say to the mountain, &quot;throw yourself in the sea&quot; and it would happen.  This is essentially what Neo is learning.Challenge yourself to see something deeper than just a great technical presentation of special effects in a suspenseful thrilling science fiction film and you will enjoy another dimension that will keep you coming back to watch this film again and again.  Maybe you will even be able to challenge yourself and be able to take the RED pill and become a spiritually aware person, realizing your need for the truth that comes from only one place...the Creator of the Universe.	5.0	A Movie Based More on Reality Than Not	2001-08-23	4	3	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A1WMC3WGIXTGD8	someone with taste	After all the good things I heard about this movie, I was disappointed. Although it borrows ideas and scenes liberally from most major sci-fi films (Blade-Runner,Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien, Terminator, V, etc.) and quite a  few anime (Megazone 23, Ghost in the Shell, Akira), it doesn't skillfully  blend them. It does manage to put forth some good ideas, unusual for  Hollywood, but many of these ideas have already been explored in the  aforementioned sci-fi films and anime. But whenever the plot runs a little  thin we are treated to lengthy fight or gunfight sequences that go  overboard with slow-motion. The special effects, a strength of the movie I  had heard, unfortunately try too hard to impress. Gratuitous panning shots  while a character remains motionless in the air were old when Gap used them  in commercials. The effects too often fall flat because they are shown at  the expense of the cinematography: a woman jumps from one building to  another and we are shown this from above rather than an angle that would  show us how truly impressive such a long leap would be. The one lesson  filmmakers should learn from George Lucas is that special effects should  push the story forward rather than be the story. This and simplicity are  the key to using great special effects in a film. The acting seems to have  not been a consideration, and the dialogue was quite weak: There were a  couple of moments when a good character rose to the occasion of finishing  off an evil character, but not without first saying a cheesy line (why not  just shoot them without talking?)  The Matrix has a good concept going but  ultimately drops it in favor of gunfights, explosions and action, which is  fine if you're 12 and that's what you're looking for.	2.0	Worth a viewing but overhyped	2000-01-09	6	3	3

The effects were spectacular and needless to say, lots of things get shot full of holes. The plot was downright creepy and the scene  with all the humans in pink egg things was one of the coolest I have ever  scene.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1BXDS5S2CCHBS	"""splatterbuff"""	The Matrix was AWESOME!  This movie is spellbinding!  The Matrix asks the question:  &quot;what is real?&quot;  Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves...DUH!) is an average guy, who is also a computer hacker who goes by  the alias NEO.  Neo wants to know what the Matrix is.  Well, he soon finds  out, and also finds out that he is prophecized to save the world!  After  the frightening truth is revealed, Neo trains for his mission:  Destroy the  Matrix.  This action and violence packed movie will keep you guessing until  the end!  The whole SHABANG is great:  the actors, the plot, the action,  but mostly the special effects!  The plot is delivered to you in such a  conceiveable manner, that you will find yourself feeling the back of your  head!  (watch the movie and you will understand)  This is a MUST SEE!

To control our lives, these A.I. have created ""The Matrix"", an ultimate system which has created a computer generated world where we can live in.  But while living in the seemingly real world of the Matrix, human beings are blindingling living a life that does not really exist, living a life without physical or mental freedom.But are human beings to be under the control of the Matrix?  Only the so-called ""One"" can free humanity from the evil Matrix, but who is this ""One""?  In ""The Matrix"", Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishburne star as heroes trying to free mankind from the Matrix.

With the help of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) Morpheus is able to free Neo from the Matrix.  But is Neo the ""One"" who will free all humanity from the Matrix?""The Matrix"" is a combination of karate, action, and sci-fi.  It includes state-of-the-art special effects that will blow you away.  This movie's depiction of the futuristic ""real world"" (our world) was both stunning and disturbing.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3FEQXNCFC68KC	"SRFireside ""ZOOM!"""	"I gotta admit. This movie is a trend setter. Well .... it's more like the movie that popularized a special style or extreme action and eye candy styled special effects. I believe there are a number of good Chinese action films that actually started that trend many years ago. The Matrix took that formula and solidified it in the American market. It was a raging success doing so and brought about a few special effects copycat movies as well as parodies. Aside from this formula The Matrix is a good movie and creative story overall.The big selling point on this movie is the concept that what you think is reality is not reality. Unfortunately this mind twisting aspect of The Matrix only lasts about 30 minutes into the movie. After that the air of mystery surrounding what The Matrix is about is pretty much solved. Soon after that the plot ends up leading you by the hand instead of unfolding gradually. I don't mind that the movie does that. It's well written enough to where they are not insulting your intelligence by spoon feeding you too much of what's going on. The one thing that annoyed me is how Neo (Keanu Reeves) finally got his mojo working and became the ultimate butt-kicker. Throughout the entire movie you are waiting for it to happen, and it's kind of a let down waiting for him figure it out. Of course once you get past the ""how"" Neo kicks major booty for the very short period left in the movie the action aspect is well worth it.They picked a really good cast for this. I particularly liked Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) and Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus). Both of them put a lot of style and attitude in their characters. Oh yeah ... this movie has style. It screams attitude and does it well. The best thing about The Matrix is the action scenes. Man! It's action sequences are on high-octane steroids! The way they meld great choreography and special effects is a wonder to behold. Once or twice it gets a little over the top, but that's okay. Though special effects and digital editing used in the fighting sequences are superb the computer generated animation they used were really nothing to write home about. Better CG animation had been done before that movie.Now for the Blu-Ray specs. First off the high def transfer is done on the VC-1 codec, which is practically identical to the HD-DVD release. That's a good thing, mind you. If you thought the movie was beautiful before wait until you see it now. Main audio is Dolby TrueHD 5.1 so this movie is still going to be the reference movie for sound systems. On top of that you get Dolby Digital 5.1 in French, Italian and Portuguese along with Dolby Digital two channel Spanish. That's a lot of languages!As far as special features are concerned I want to just pass up talking about any special features that were on the previous Matrix DVD as there is plenty already written about that. This disk has the exact same features and commentaries with the exception of the Red Pill function. What you do get above all that is the following:In Movie Experience - I think this replaces the red pill and gives you picture in picture documentary content.Behind the Matrix - A series of featurettes that seem to focus mostly on particular scenes in the movie including The Dance of the Master: Yuen Wo Ping's Blocking Tapes, The Bathroom Fight and Wet Wall, The Code of the Red Dress, The Old Exit: Wabash and Lake, Agent Down, But Wait- There's MoreFollow the White Rabbit - More scene featurettes and they include Trinity Escapes, Pod, Kung Fu, The Wall, Bathroom Fight, Government Lobby, Government Roof, Helicopter and Subway.The Matrix Revisited - Yup... the entire documentary that they sold separately is now included with this one movie; no need to buy the full set to enjoy it.The Music Revisited - 41 audio tracks from the film (this is in addition to the isolated music score w/commentary).Tons of trailers - Two theatrical and eight TV trailers.Marilon Manson Music Video ""Rock is Dead""A written intro by the Wachowski Brothers47 page booklet with photos and insider informationIf you're an action junkie The Matrix is right up your alley. If you are looking for a ""what's real is not real"" mind twister it's not bad, but don't expect a mind-bender. Dark City did a much better job in that area. The Blu-Ray release is definitely the best offering to date, which is nice considering a lot of movies had a sad initial release with no special features. This one tops previous releases in spades in that aspect. The Matrix is definitely a fun movie to watch."	5.0	Blu-Ray release definitely a winner.	2009-02-20	11	8	3

0790745399	The Matrix	AATKF0HDBQL86	"S. Smith ""ltcolkiranerys"""	I love The Matrix.  It's a great movie that reaches deep within the human psyche and deals with what could easily be considered one of today's biggest fears--the fear of technology and what kind of negative impact it could have on today's society.  It tells the story of Neo (Keanu Reeves), who works for a large, faceless corporation by day and who is a system hacker by night.  One night, however, he meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who takes him to see her superior, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and that's when the REAL fun begins.I gave this DVD a high rating simply because everything about the movie was excellent.  I was very impressed by Keanu Reeves in the role of Neo--he has come a long way from his Bill and Ted days, and can play any part with flair and panache.  Carrie-Anne Moss was good as Trinity, and Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus was dazzling.  I also loved Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith, the psycho nutjob who does everything he can to destroy Morpheus and Company.The best part about this movie is that it blends the action and storytelling so well, unlike most action films these days, which tend to be all action and no plot.  The Matrix has a good, well thought-out plot that fits in quite nicely around the action scenes and makes the movie very enjoyable.All in all, a wonderful film.  I'm looking forward to the sequels.	5.0	Another great fear-of-technology flick!	2003-01-25	11	8	3

0790745399	The Matrix	AGJ8PSWYNV0XX	Steel	The Matrix was hailed as the best action thriller of the year, and I have to say I have never seen fight scenes like them, the only film that comes anywhere close is the excellent Blade. A brilliant script, fantastic  performances from the cast, and a good directing job have combined to make  this film highly watchable to anybody. However the categorisation of sci-fi  action thriller is often met with cries of 'Oh no I won't like that' or  'It's really not what I like to watch', but trust in me even if this is not  the kind of film you would normally watch it is well worth a look in, and  that much it certainly deserves. Keanu Reeves is on top form as Neo, the  main character, expelling rumours of his sawdust like brain, wooden acting  talent, and general stupidity.  This is him at his best and he is as good  as any big name I've seen recently. Laurence Fishburne plays the arcane and  sinister Morpheus to a tee, his riddles will drive you insane after a  while, but that is part of the film, and watching how the riddles solve  themselves is highly enthralling. Carrie-Ann Moss is good in her supporting  role as Trinity, but in my opinion it's Hugo Weaver as Smith, the  patronising agent who steals the show, he is the character you love to  hate, but you can't help but like his character, he's so devious. The  Matrix is a brilliant film, it's plot however is highly complicated, and it  helps to have someone to explain it to you, or at least watch it twice. You  may be tempted to give up due to the complexity of it all but be patient  and trust me this film is more than worth perservering with, and even if  you don't like it, just give it a try.

0790745399	The Matrix	A23LRPE5CNV9PN	Stephen Sadlowski	Yeah, yeah, it &quot;rocked&quot;, but there were a few plot holes, and the end was pretty weak. Rather than making it a &quot;love story&quot; type ending, the Trinity character and her affection could have brought  resolution to the story, with more emphasis on helping &quot;the One&quot;  free his mind and over come the parameters of the Matrix instead of.. well,  you know, typical hollywood garbage.If you suspend  disbelief and don't  actively search for fault, a pretty entertaining piece of work that  deserves the box office response it got.Visually stunning, with what I  thought were pretty much seamless special affects, it did have it's moments  of thought provocation.To some of the previous posters, the colors or  hues of the film were purposefully done, to differentiate between the  &quot;real&quot; world and the matrix.But I loved the DVD. A great  example to &quot;show off&quot; the &quot;not haves&quot; or  &quot;tapeheads' the way of the future. A better than decent transfer,  loads of extra material, and great behind the scenes footage, intellegently  done, with the white rabbit and red pill options.A great buy for an  example (not the absolute best, but pretty darn good) for the technical  aspects of DVD, a must buy for sci-fi, and techno freaks, a definite rent  for a Saturday night action fix.	4.0	A mixed bag, great story, lousy ending.	1999-12-19	5	5	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	One thing I have learned about both writing and reading reviews is that, ultimately you must make your own choices and use reviews only as guidelines.  Some like to read summaries and characterizations, while others like to provide their insights into the acting and cast.  Me&#8230;I only care about the actual quality of the transfer from Standard Def to Blu Ray as I don't buy films that I haven't already seen and decided whether I liked them or not.  Back in 1999 when this became available the quality was considered excellent but any review on the quality of a disc depends upon the home theater audio and video system the reviewer is watching it on.  This review utilized a new Panasonic ZT 65&#34; screen with a fairly esoteric home 7.1 surround system.Video&#8230;.What was superb 12 years ago is not quite as superb today.  Very good contrast with a slightly desaturated color grading for backgrounds while skin tones are saturated up a touch.  I saw no artifacting or aliasing in any part of the film.  Deep and true blacks appeared to be somewhat grayish and failed to reach the low end of the black IRE or Pluge.  The Mbps rate seemed to average in the high teens to low twenties.  While the imaging is good, I do not think it is great nor do I  believe this film was remastered for blu ray.  There really was not much of a difference between the imaging of the blu ray as opposed to my Standard Def DVD of the Matrix.  That said, there is nothing horribly wrong with the disc and I am sure that many may disagree with my observations.  Just remember that much depends upon the quality of the TV monitor being watched.AUDIO&#8230;The first half of the film kept the audio, for the most part, in the front sound stage with some minimal pans across the front surrounds.  The lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 audio provided clean and transparent dialogue tho the audio level sounded a bit low to me. A quick adjustment to my remote's volume control and all was and stayed well.  It is in the second half of the film that your surrounds and LFE channel really come into play with panning audio and foley fx omnipresent.  During the gun battle in the attempt to rescue Morpheus, it sounded to me that more discreet directionality could have been directed to the rear surrounds as opposed to mostly being in the front stage.Extras&#8230;Not much..a commentary, trailers and previews.While the Blu Ray is good and would be an improvement over the Standard Def version, do not expect any night and day differences as this film was, to my mind, simply re-encoded to Blu Ray rather than being remastered properly.  There is nothing at all wrong with the Blu Ray but its additional benefits over SD are limited.I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.  All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the Blu Ray itself.Thanks for reading.	4.0	The Matrix on Blu Ray&#8230;Just the Transfer	2013-12-20	4	4	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A12A8LU93A132U	Steve	This movie has been reviewed to death, but I wanted to comment on the commentary included with the DVD edition. First let me say that this in one of my all time favorite sci-fi flicks right up there with Alien, Dune,  Blade Runner. The commentary is however, the absolute worst I have ever  heard. The director runs out of interesting stuff to say. Carrie-Anne Moss  had the most interesting things to say, but you hear from her only briefly  in the beginning of the film and then at the end. She said nothing during  the whole middle of the film. Possibly she was intimidated by the special  effect supervisor which had the most to say, but fell into such deep  special effects lingo that, as a layman, I could only understand about 1 in  3 words. Plus his black humor was out of place and put me off. A ground  breaking film in terms of special effects I think should have a 5 star  commentary as well. A redeeming feature of this DVD edition is the  mini-featurettes that are included.	5.0	A comment on the commentary of a 5 star film.	2000-03-17	4	3	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A1JJOV69MAU2J2	Steven Dennis	The Matrix takes us beyond the standard sci-fi adventure by weaving myth-making (&quot;You're the One, Neo&quot;) and classic story-telling (take the Red Pill, go to the &quot;Real World,&quot; take the Blue Pill, stay in &quot;Neverland&quot;) with truly revolutionary special effects, sound and overall production quality. This is the movie that made DVD players more than just a luxury item, it made DVD a necessity. Watching this on VHS would be like watching a Picasso behind layers of gauze. No movie is sharper or better suited to the digital world than a movie where the premise is that the world we see every day is nothing but ones and zeroes hardwired into our head.In the realm of action and sci-fi, there will be movies that are B.M. (Before the Matrix) and movies that are A.M. (You guessed it). This is now the standard.As far as the other qualities of the film -- you know, acting and the like -- they are good, but not oscar-caliber, with the exception of Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheus. Keanu Reeves plays the only character he knows how (himself), which is fine, and the other actors/actresses all perform their roles efficiently. But, frankly, it's hard for the acting to matter too much when buildings are exploding, people are flying through the air and reality is warping around you.This is quite simply a movie that redefines the too-often used adjecting &quot;mind-blowing.&quot;BTW, the intensity of this movie means that young children and squeamish adults should stay away. I know several people who were unable to handle several of the sequences in the movie. I had no trouble, but I'd put the squeamish content as on a par with Aliens or Terminator 2.

The fact  is, The Matrix is already here - and kiddies, there's no way out.But  that's reality, to the movie - Rich, dark, and complex, The Matrix weaves  Biblical references, Homeric allusions (compare Odysseus and Telemakhos'  shootout vs. the suiters and Neo &amp; Trinity's finale assault),  post-Structruralist ontology, and a visual poetry unlike anything seen  before.  It's like Beethoven's passionate symphonies, Hegel's conquering  Spirit, the final scenes of Faust.  It is a phoenix borne of the massive  weight of it's own message.  I can't express how wonderful the film is -  metaphor fails.Perhaps the best part of The Matrix is that it gives  voice to the underlying tensions of this era.  As we approach &quot;The  Millennium&quot; (or to those familiar with Baudrillard [Author of  Simulacra and Simulation - where Neo keeps his cash] we could say the  &quot;sign&quot; of The Millennium), many have become aware of an edgy  nexus where something about us or in us may by revealed...Ergo all this Y2K  paranoia, flim-flam (note to consumers: someone's making money on your  paranoia).The Matrix gives voice to this suspicion and resonates with  the braveness we must hold in stepping out into the following years.In  short, the movie is the animus for the cynicism, the doubt, the danger, the  disillusionment of our time.  It is not truly a film, but an embodiment of  the spirit of the time (zeitgeist; or, if I may abuse Hegel's terminology:  &quot;A world-historical film&quot;).That the movie is phenomenal and  should be bought goes without saying, that it is a powerful representation  of our society must be acknowledged.	5.0	Worth 500 Stars, our generation's Blade Runner	1999-08-19	5	2	3
0790745399	The Matrix	A3QOLFJ9ZCZGXO	Steven Logan	The matrix is one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. The special  efects are cool. I Liked the martial arts alot. The fight between Neo and  Morpheous was the best fighting seen. You have to watch this movie at least  twice to understand it fully. This film is defently Keano Reeves best movie  next to Speed. I like the way they explain everything in the first half of  the movie and then the action picks up. I really wish I could have seen it  in the theater.

0790745399	The Matrix	A344DZS4EBECHQ	Steven Quan	I enjoyed this movie thoroughly from the get-go. The storyline was interesting and the great acting performances from Fishburne and Keanu  Reeves really helped to bolster this film. The biggest problem I have with  this movie that people seem to completely oblivious to is that there's no  ending. The story of this movie is about Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne,  Trinity and the rest of their Team who are trying to fight their way back  to Zion (a place where people are not controlled by &quot;The  Matrix&quot;). Not only do Keanu and crew not make it back to Zion, we  never even get to see it. That's the whole goal of the movie! I was left  with a hollow feeling inside me, like something was left unfulfilled. Not  to mention the fact that in the end, there were 3 deadly agents left. Keanu  Reeves kills one of them with some deft moves, the other two agents scatter  in different directions. That means that not only do we not get to see  Zion, we don't get to see the destruction of the Matrix, and there are  still two agents running around (who don't pose much of a threat to Neo,  but...) who still have the potential to kill off the rest of Neo's team.  I'm not going to argue with the rest of the reviews on the Amazon Dot Com  site. They are valid. This movie does have great special effects, very good  acting, and a storyline that pulls you in. But there's no sense of finality  in this movie. To compare this with Star Wars, yes, Darth Vader was still  alive, but at least the biggest impending force (the Death Star) was  destroyed, and the Rebel Alliance could breath easy for a little bit. In  the Matrix, at the end of the film, nobody can rest easy, not even Neo even  if he did manage to kill off the last 2 agents. There's no telling what  other kind of havoc the Matrix can dish out, because the Matrix still  controls everything!!! That's what really bothers me about this flick.	4.0	A review from a viewer who is actually awake	1999-12-27	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A2Q56KZT6WHIY7	Striker	"There's no sophomore jinx for the Wachowski Brothers. Andy and Larry, a pair of obviously talented film makers, have returned to theaters with The Matrix, a science fiction thriller that is every bit the match of their debut effort, Bound, for tension, excitement, and intelligence. In an era when movie scripts (especially those pigeonholed into the science fiction genre) are becoming increasingly more stupid and special effects reliant, the Wachowskis prove that style and substance do not have to be mutually exclusive.I loved The Matrix. The movie is kinetic, atmospheric, visually stunning, and mind-bending. It toys with the boundaries between reality and fantasy in unique and interesting ways. In its approach and content, it reminded me of last year's vastly underrated Dark City. There's also a synergy with two movies due to be released within the next month: David Cronenberg's eXistenZ and Alejandro Amenabar's Open Your Eyes. The Matrix is undeniably science fiction, but, unlike most pictures claiming that association, it never falls into the boring, expected patterns of space battles and laser gun shoot-outs. Instead, it ventures into territory that, while not virgin, is sufficiently interesting to provide an involving, invigorating backdrop.Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is leading a double life. To most people, he's a hard-working computer programmer who holds down a nine-to-five job for a major software corporation. But, in the privacy of his home, he's a hacker named Neo who is ""guilty of virtually every computer crime [there's] a law for."" Neo is dissatisfied with his existence, and, while he's groping for a meaning to it, he is contacted by a mysterious computer presence known as Morpheus. ""Wake up Neo,"" a printout on his monitor screen reads. ""The Matrix has you. Follow the white rabbit."" And so begins an amazing odyssey for both Neo and the audience.It turns out that Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is the captain of a small space ship, and he believes that Neo is a messianic figure. When the two finally meet, Morpheus explains to Neo that all is not as it seems. The reality he is used to is a fabrication, the product of a sinister race of intelligent machines that use human beings as power supplies, to be discarded at will. Neo is dubious, and Morpheus sets out to show him the truth. Soon, he is learning how to manipulate the Matrix: a computer-generated dreamworld built by the machines to control human minds. But danger lurks ahead for Morpheus and his small band of followers. The goal of the machines is to eliminate all free humans, and their most powerful weapons, the Sentient Agents (who look like Men in Black), are closing in. Led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), their goal is to capture Morpheus and pry the secrets from his brain.There's much more to The Matrix than this, but to explain further would be to reveal plot twists better discovered through viewing. Although the film frequently toys with the blurred line between grim reality and computer-generated fantasy, it rarely leaves the viewer completely confused (except, perhaps, at the very beginning). The Wachowskis have carefully structured the story in such a way that the audience is capable of following the action and understanding what's going on even when all of the secrets have not been revealed. Nevertheless, because The Matrix is intelligent, it will defeat those unwilling to invest some intellectual participation. The payoff is worth the effort.Stylistically, The Matrix is much like Bound. Both films are visually stunning, with images painstakingly constructed and action sequences choreographed to excite the eye and quicken the pulse. The Wachowskis use a varied pallette that includes shadows, slow motion, quick cuts, and offbeat humor to paint a unique portrait. Like in Dark City, theirs is a grim world, where darkness and gloom seemingly always hold sway. Everything from the set design to the costumes (lots of black, lots of sunglasses) is intended to contribute to an overall look. When it comes to shoot-outs, the Wachowskis show that John Woo isn't the only director capable of doing interesting things with familiar devices. The shots of Keanu Reeves streaking down a hall with guns blazing all around him and the air thick with shattered bits of concrete is only one of many snapshots that lingers in the mind's eye long after they have vanished from the screen. The special effects, which are not as numerous as those in many science fiction pieces, are flawless.Keanu Reeves is not generally regarded as a strong actor, but, given the right part - one that doesn't demand much subtlety or emoting - he can be effective. His role as Neo fits the criteria. The Matrix needs a leading man who can look good, act cool, and not stumble over his dialogue, and Reeves is three for three. It's easily his best work since Speed, where the same kinds of demands were made of him. For more nuanced performances, the Wachowskis rely on the rest of the cast: the always excellent Laurence Fishburne, brilliant character actor Joe Pantoliano (who appeared in Bound), and Carrie-Anne Moss, who looks great in black leather. Aussie Hugo Weaving (Proof) brings the perfect mix of dry wit and menace to his role as the head Man in Black.The Matrix offers a little something for everyone. The die-hard science fiction fan will discover a plot that mixes and matches both new and old conventions of the genre in a compelling fashion. Action aficionados will find that there's no shortage of electric excitement, whether it's in the form of hand-to-hand kung fu-type fights or shoot-outs with seemingly limitless ammunition. There's also betrayal, a little romance, some humor, and a moral dilemma or two, all wrapped into a well-produced package. As I stated earlier, the way in which the Wachowskis choose to resolve everything seems slightly contrived, but, in the overall scheme of things, that's a small price to pay for one of the most enjoyable science fiction thrillers to reach the screen in months."	5.0	You have to see the Matrix to believe it!!!	2005-07-11	3	1	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A2XYJWJQ1EMUXF	Strobe Lights And Blown Speakers	The Matrix - a Warner Brothers release, written and directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski_The Matrix_ breaks new ground in the sci-fi/action film genre.  Not only does it feature revolutionary special effects, but it has a complex storyline to boot.  In _The Matrix_, Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a hacker recruited by a team of rebels, led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishbourne), whom law enforement agents regard as the &quot;most dangerous man on the planet.&quot;  Neo joins Morpheus and his crew, where he is showed the world as it truly is - the haunting reality that humans have been overtaken by a race of machines, and, worse still, are being used simply as an energy source for these machines.  The purpose of Morpheus and his crew is to disrupt our imaginary &quot;dream world&quot; that the machines have created to keep us happy (the Matrix), and free our minds.The special effects in _The Matrix_ are absolutely stunning.  The Wachowski Brothers and their crew have developed what they like to call &quot;bullet time.&quot; This &quot;bullet time&quot; is composed of hundreds of still shots of a target, that when put together render ultra-realistic super-slow motion.There are many similarities between Neo's transformation over the course of the film, and the life of Christ.  Some of these things seem, at first glance, trite or inconsequential, but upon further investigation, unravel deeper meaning.  An example of this is Neo's real name, Thomas Anderson.  Anderson, when translated, means &quot;son of man.&quot; Neo also means &quot;new&quot; - Neo Anderson, &quot;the new son of man.&quot;  Is Neo like a new Messiah?In one portion of the film, Morphues takes Neo to see the Oracle, an old woman who happens to know everything.  She predicts a Second Coming of sorts, and tells Neo to &quot;find his path.&quot;  Morpheus is absolutely convinced that Neo is &quot;the One,&quot; the saviour for mankind (much like Christ).  In another portion of the film, Neo is, for a moment, dead.  He is then brough back to like (resurrected), where he shortly thereafter, and very symbolically, ascends to the heavens._The Matrix_ will stand as a benchmark in special effects and storytelling for years to come.	5.0	Mindblowing SFX and a great storyline	2003-05-15	17	11	6
0790745399	The Matrix	A1NXMCO8IOW8A6	"Stuart Preece ""Digitalcavalier"""	Well....what a wonderful surprise the matrix turned out to be. Kind of sneaking in through the back door while everyone was waiting in 5 mile queues for the Phantom Menace and delivering arguably the finest sci-fi /  cyberpunk movie experience for quite some time.This movie is genuinely  innovative on loads of different levels it is frankly difficult not to be  swept up with all that's taking place on onscreen. From the polished  direction courtesy of the Wachowski brothers (messrs Andy and Larry) to a  not completely useless performance from Keanu Reeves. The supporting cast  work extremely well, especially Lawrence Fishburne who looks cooler than  cool with his pair of little clip on shades and not forgetting relative  newcomer Carrie Ann Moss, who plays the hard as nails trinity.But the  real stars of the show have to be the effects. From slo-mo kung fu fights  that run the gamut of every Jackie Chan trick you've probably ever seen, to  scenes of pure arenaline pumping bullet carnage that would frankly make  master of hardware John Woo sit down and scribble a few notes.Yep, this  is a movie that lives upto it's own hype, an excellent and inventive story,  some brilliant eye candy and no Jar Jar binks to get on your nerves.Just remember to buy some band aids for your chin...for it will be  hitting the ground quite a lot when you watch this film.	5.0	a very slick and entertaining slice of sci fi cool	1999-08-05	3	2	1

The reason this movie has taken DVD by storm is because other movies just aren't original any more. On top of that, this movie is perhaps the most essential DVD for demoing a home theater. The computer-aided action and filming is incredible. While the movie is rated R (which kept me from seeing it for so long) I couldn't find anything in it to justify that. There are some tough fight scenes (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had fight scenes too) but the language and fighting combined justify a PG-13 at the most.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2WAOADKUR0CPU	Tanner	Is the world that we know today really what it seems? Does it seem like we live an orchestrated life defined by what society deems as important? And does it seem that our lives are overly governed by the many rules of both man and nature? These questions are the main currents of Andy and Lana Wachowski&#8217;s movie The Matrix which challenges what we see as reality today.Thomas A. Anderson, an orchestrated computer programmer during the day, lives a dual life where he is known as Neo online through his late night computer hacking. Beyond his day job Neo, played by Keanu Reaves, has always sensed and imagined that there was something hidden elsewhere beyond what he considered reality at the time.After receiving messages and a phone call from an unknown source later identified as Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishbourne, Neo joins a rebellion and becomes aware of the struggle to battle a war against machines in a post human driven world known as the matrix. The matrix is a software system imposed on humans by machines that limits their understanding and capabilities of reality. Neo becomes &#8220;the one&#8221; as referred to by Morpheus. He is pressed with the problem of breaking the bounds of the matrix and freeing mankind from the control of the machines before the last known unrestricted humans are eliminated.Neo along with his arch rival Agent Smith, who is a machine within human form, counter each other&#8217;s personalities in a way that makes the distinction between man and machine that much greater. Agent smith, played by Hugo Weaving, illustrates the emotionless task oriented function of machines. His name in particular suggests the generalization and uniformity of machines. Neo&#8217;s name contrasts this generalization expressing the individuality of humans as a representative symbol. Hugo Weaving&#8217;s deep monotonic tone compared to Neo&#8217;s softer relaxed tone contrasts each other&#8217;s characters further against one other leading to an even greater distinction between man and machines.Adding to the distinction of the men controlled by the machines and the men aware of the society ran by the matrix, is the acting of Laurence Fishbourne. Fishbourne as Morpheus is part of the rebellion against the matrix and separates himself from the matrix by his aurora as an all knowing character. His elevated presence and his subtle cues of knowing what is to come next lead to the greater disparity between himself and the people around him. These details portrayed by the main actors lead to the best illustration of a thematic idea unprecedented in a movie up until today.That unprecedented idea is a movie based on what seems to be reality versus what reality actually is. Likewise artificial intelligence used by mankind in turn fights itself against man in a way that ironically makes humans look less human in the machine made artificial reality. A complex and highly in depth idea for any person to think of let alone direct and visualize clearly. Irony plays it&#8217;s part also in the scene that describes how machines took over the world during the turn of the 20th century. Instead of humans using machines to help in their energy consumption, Andy and Lana Wachowski have turned the tables in this film. Machines instead farm humans in order to get their energy to run and operate the matrix. The dominator and dominated have essentially flipped roles. The originality of the futuristic film The Matrix questions the viewers perception of what is and isn&#8217;t real while the actors used within the film support the direction that the film takes which ultimately leaves the viewers questioning and wanting to see more!	5.0	Originality and Direction	2014-02-17	2	2	0

But seriously, whenever you mention the title, &#8216;The Matrix,&#8217; to someone even remotely familiar with popular cinema, what are the first things that come to mind? The nature of pop culture&#8217;s influence, the passage of time, and people&#8217;s notoriously short memory shows us that art, even well-made and well known art, inevitably gets reduced to a few key phrases, sequences, or descriptions. For the Brothers Wachowski&#8217;s &#8216;The Matrix,&#8217; what their work is most famous for are intense, nail-biting action that pays homage to the influential work of John Woo and other Hong Kong action cinema, and its groundbreaking, trendsetting special effects. And it does have all that &#8212; but, oh, does it have so much more.&#8216;The Matrix&#8217; is sometimes dismissed by film snobs (aka some of my peers) as merely delivering overrated action and FX encouraging waves of big-budget, poorly written action flicks to follow. While I agree that it certainly inspired a lot of lower quality action movies that came later, &#8216;The Matrix&#8217; is anything but low quality. For one thing, &#8216;The Matrix&#8217; deals as heavily in philosophy and allusions to pop culture as it does in slick, sci-fi action. The whole premise of the film is an examination of Rene Descartes&#8217; evil genius theory, the brain-in-vat thought experiment, the themes behind &#8216;Alice in Wonderland,&#8217; and many, many other complex ideas. While it does not pick any one particular idea dissect it as thoroughly as, say, the &#8220;fall from grace&#8221; theme in &#8216;Citizen Kane,&#8217; &#8216;The Matrix&#8217;s breadth and universe is far more expansive. There are literally dozens of themes and ideas it discusses during the course of its story, and instead of being bogged down by all these bells and whistles, the story and setting of the movie become all the more rich.As for the action, which is the thing most casual film fans are familiar with in regard to the &#8216;The Matrix,&#8217; it is, quite frankly, outstanding. The movie deals heavily in religious and philosophical themes, and I give ample credit to this as it is as important to the film as its other strengths, yet at the same time, &#8216;The Matrix&#8217; is an action film in its purest form. The film takes its time getting to the action, letting the script build steam while it fleshes out the characters and the conflicts &#8212; a perfect example of veteran pacing and good writing. But when we finally do get to the action, boy oh boy does it arrive with a storm. Few movies indeed have come close to replicating the action of &#8216;The Matrix&#8217; (&#8216;Equilibrium&#8217; is one of the few that comes to mind). The shootouts and fistfights have such a fresh and original flavor, and are so well staged, that it becomes hard to watch a lot of other action films after seeing this. It mixes the action and excitement of science fiction, Hong Kong flicks, spaghetti westerns, anime, and post-apocalyptic worlds extremely well.&#8216;The Matrix&#8217; is so influential and frequently referenced in popular culture and (more importantly) is so well made that it HAS to be required viewing for fans of cinema &#8212; not just the hardcore ones. Not only does it pay homage to classic genres of the past, it set the tone for action movies of the future.&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-SCORE: 10/10+ The script not only paces the action very effectively, but it smartly focuses on the human element of its plot and utilizes a huge variety of philosophical and moral concepts to its advantage.+ Keanu Reeves may be a wooden, goofy actor in most roles, but he&#8217;s golden here as the initially awkward computer hacker who transforms into humanity&#8217;s savior. And a badass.+ A modern day Hollywood homage to Hong Kong action cinema, this is as good as it gets. The final thirty minutes are the stuff of legend.? This film introduced me to Rage Against the Machine. Best end credits song selection ever, that&#8217;s for sure.	5.0	'The Matrix' (1999): Review	2013-03-08	1	1	0

It's a visionary tale about mankind, that has superb tecnical values. My only complaint it's it's thin screenplay. It has great ideas but if it were  a little more consistent and complex, the Wachowsky Brothers could have  made a revolution on SF genre. But, as it's stands, it's an excelent movie.  With outstanding special effects and great camera work all around. The  actors manage to give good performences, specially Laurence Fishburn.  It's pace keeps the spectator amazed every minute of it. Visionary,  outstanding look but thin in plot (although the plot it's very interesting,  it is very short and little complex...) this is a must have for any science  fiction fan.

No I don't live in the booneys or anything.  I just never got around to seeing it, and usually I at least rent a film  before I buy it.  So I watched it on my DVD player with Dolby Digital, and  I was blown away!  This is the defenition of DVD, what it is made for.  Even the standard version has plenty of extras.  I havd a DVD-ROM and  there is included features for that.  So on the DVD side it is defenately  worth it, especially for reference (and to show off your system).  However,  the movie itself has some weakness, especially with any person being turned  into an agent.  This is not explained too well.  Also Keanu Reeves cannot  die and come back to life, the love scene is unreal! He died in the  &quot;real&quot; world, not a computer simulation.  This is just one of the  small things, other than that this is awesome.  By the way, if you have  this DVD don't bother buying the soundtrack, it is already on the disk!  However, you need a DVD player for it (duh).  I hope other movies can  follow this technology!	4.0	Excellent DVD, Questionable in other aspects.....	2000-01-18	2	1	1

With the incredible 'bullet-time' cinematic sequences, you'll find yourself repeating scenes over and over and over.  The plot is so thick, so  well-thought-through (if that makes sense) it is probably the best science  fiction story ever written.  The DVD picture is so clear, so much better  then on VHS and the sound makes you feel like you are there.

This movie is hear and it cannot be ignored.  It  is the matrix.  Keanu Reeves is the savior of the human race against the  evils of artificial intelligence.  Lawrence Fishburne is the man behind  bringing Reeves to the realization that he is the &quot;one&quot;.  The  outstanding performances of all those cast in the film is another plus.

This is one of the few movies that hasn't made me  start to look at my watch towards the end hoping it would finish.  While  watching this film nothing else enters your mind but the story - not  ex-girlfriends - not troublesome friends - not the annoying sod next to you  telling you that he has the same computer as Neo - absolutely NOTHING!!

0790745399	The Matrix	A3TFFSO47Z3BX8	"The Bluto ""adncjs3"""	&quot;The Matrix&quot; is the most exciting and original science fiction action adventure in years. Ranking up there with classics like the two &quot;Terminators&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, and the &quot;Star Wars Trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is an ambitious blend of sci-fi themes and thrilling action.  Like &quot;Terminator&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars&quot; years before, &quot;The Matrix&quot; has raised the standard for this kind of entertainment for the next decade.The story is bizarre.  It begins with a lone computer hacker played by Keanu Reeves who calls himself &quot;Neo&quot; and has uncovered a secret that affects the entire human race.  From there his adventure begins as a mysterious figure played by Laurence Fishburne in top form, shows Neo what the world really is.  Neo faces challenges from sinister agents who are determined to stop him and his new friends.  This is where much of the great action comes from.  Not only abundant but inventive and stylish as well, the action sequences are a major signature in this film and will be copied for years to come, and already have in such big films as &quot;Mission:Impossilbe II&quot;.There are themes in &quot;The Matrix&quot; which are deeper than your usual sci-fi fare and even some similarities with the themes in &quot;Terminator&quot; and &quot;StarWars&quot;.  There is a hero who is conflicted with his two destinies and a post apocalyptic world ran by machines, sound familiar?  This kind of subject matter can't adequately be resolved in a two-hour film, at least not well.  So &quot;The Matrix&quot; is really a promise of great things to come and seeing that two sequels are being planned we don't have too long to wait.	5.0	What is &quot;The Matrix&quot;?

0790745399	The Matrix	A2T6G6JMZOZ3O7	The General	In the film the Matrix, there is an amazing amount of parallels between this film and the story of Jesus in the Bible.  The most obvious is that Neo represents Jesus.  There are many things that happen to Neo that are similar to events that happend to Jesus.  The first is that when Neo is rescued from the Matrix and he is in a membrane filled with water, similar to the womb that a baby spends the first 9 months of its life in.  The action of Neo breaking out and sliding down a tube into the 'real world' is similar to a baby being born, which represents the spiritual rebirth of a person when the accept Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour.  Another event that parallels Jesus' training in the desert, being tempted by Satan is Neo's training against Morpheus in the kung-fu program, preparing the One to do His job.  Two other events that parallel occurances in Jesus' life happen near the end of the film, where Neo is shot and killed but then resurrected by the love of Trinity, just as the Trinity's love brings Jesus back from the dead.  The final one is right at the end of the movie, when Neo flies up into the air.  This is similar to JEsus' ascension into Heaven, and the beginning of the new way of life for Christians.  Other characters that parallel Bible characters are: Morpheus, who represents John the Baptist in that He is preparing the way for the One; Cypher, who, like Judas the betrayer, betrays the Saviour to the enemy; and the Oracle, who can represent any of the prophets from the Old Testament who foretold Jesus' coming.  I think that anyone who enjoys this film, Christian or not, should read the gospels in the Bible just so they can see the amazing amount of similarities between the two very different stories.	5.0	Amazing Parallels	2002-09-30	8	3	5

The awful  dialogue contains such lines as this -- &quot;Do you believe in fate?&quot;  -- &quot;No...Because I don't like the thought of being controlled.&quot;  The immense popularity of this mindless and overlong bore is mystifying,  but then again, what can one say considering that the majority is always  wrong?

0790745399	The Matrix	A2MYUI8IT6UBUU	"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com"""	"What is The Matrix? Oozing cool, this sci-fi action thriller draws parallels from biblical stories, countless religions and ancient Japanese lore. To say that it must be seen for yourself is no understatement. Revolutionary special effects, spawning dozens of notorious parodies, most notably during a 1999 Super Bowl commercial, ultra hip wardrobes and Gatling gun action firepower, The Matrix single-handedly saved Warner Bros. from a lengthy cinema slump, and put the ""awesome"" back in R-rated films and black leather apparel.Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who is plagued by thoughts of the indecipherability of the real world and the dream world. When he is mysteriously contacted by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), an infamous and regaled underworld leader, he follows clues and the shapely messenger Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) to unlock the secrets of the Matrix. To know more would spoil the ingenious and surrealism of this masterful film; needless to say, Neo wanders down the rabbit hole to see how far it goes.Redefining cool, the action and stunts in The Matrix are nothing short of unbelievable. Focusing heavily on carefully choreographed martial arts battles and highflying helicopter stunts, this film will enliven your faith in the action genre.Utilizing slow motion in a dance of magical cinematography, scenes which would otherwise be exceptional are transformed into pure genius. A helicopter shootout on a rooftop with gushing water, blazing bullets, slow motion diving through mid-air, and a plethora of machine-gun bullets kicking out of a mounted Gatling gun so hard and fast that they fall like metal rain, is only one example of stylized action that is truly beyond unique. In perhaps the most famous scene of the franchise, Neo and Trinity march through a heavily guarded security terminal packing dozens of automatic weapons - all in beautiful slow motion. To see the look of shock on the security officers faces as they set off the alarm and open fire on the unsuspecting guards is sheer bliss. What ensues is the gunfight of the 20th century as they defy gravity and blast their way through a hallway loaded with shotgun-toting SWAT troopers.Magnificently blending science-fiction action and a good old-fashioned love story, to delve too deeply into the intricacy of The Matrix is to do it injustice. Complex and well-organized, the multiple colliding themes of betrayal, destiny, fate and hope, help to serve up a scrumptious cinematic dish. The detail-oriented acting and character development is outstanding, and drives the film with sincerity and determination. The sinister Agent Smith, played by Hugo Weaving, is immortalized as one of the greatest screen villains and manages to be cool and collected in a disconcerting manner, and startlingly malevolent in his final confrontation with Neo. Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is stern, resolute and commanding. Trinity is the anti-femme fatale, lithe and sexy in her shiny black leather and skillfully deadly. These admirable and awe-inspiring characters are intertwined into an intricate world magnificently crafted by the Wachowski Brothers. Their previous feature, Bound, proved they had a knack for eye-pleasing storytelling and characters. The Matrix is inspired by many themes and ideas suggested in Japanese Manga comics, but the way the characters and storyline is depicted is a vision for which they deserve undivided credit.The special effects are particularly noteworthy as brand new technology and CG methods were invented for several of the shocking fight sequences. During the rooftop melee, bullets pierce the air around Neo and he reels backward in an attempt to dodge them. While ripples of waves circulate around the slowed down bullets, the camera circles around him in over 360. Special features on the DVD supplement The Matrix Revisited delve into the complex camera set up and green screen approach used for this often mimicked shot.Few science-fiction films have been so heavily praised, let alone a film from less than ten years ago. The Matrix spawned two sequels, as well as The Animatrix, a collection of animated films, as well as video games, comics, action figure lines and more.

Neo plays catch-up with the audience the entire first half of  the film, which grew on my nerves because I really wanted this film to get  moving.The fight scenes are spectacular and original.  However, they are  also fluff and extraenous to the plot.  One of the first rules of a  screenwriter is that if a scene does not propel the plot forward, it  shouldn't be in the film.  But considering how none of the scenes in this  film propel the plot forward, I can see how it is easy to miss this fact  when it comes to the fight scenes (such as Morpheus kung-fu training  Neo).Yes, I am aware that this is planned to be a trilogy now.  HOWEVER,  there is no way the Wachowski Bros. knew this film would hit it big like it  did.  they could have hoped and dreamed with all their hearts, but they did  NOT leave their script the mess that it is so that they could add on to it  with two more movies.  Anyone that says the flaws in the film I point out  are okay because it's a trilogy is mistaken.  If it was true, that is a  horrible excuse for this sloppy script.I would be glad to discuss this  with all of you &quot;The Matrix&quot; lovers out there, if you'd like.  I  really wanted to enjoy this film, but there were just too many flaws for  me. :(	2.0	Bad character development, no plot It could have been great!	2000-04-06	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A24ZMAH8JTIL6E	"""thelightmemyselfandi"""	This movie has EVERYTHING!  Not only is it the best movie to own at home THIS YEAR, it's one of the best purchases you'll ever make.  If you've never seen it before, you will love it.  The re-watch value is incredible.  Consider the fact that I saw the movie 19 times in theaters before buying  it, and the fact that I still watch it a good 3 times a week.  I especially  enjoy the performances by the great Laurence Fishbourn as Morpheus and the  gentlemen who plays Agent Smith (I said I wathc the movie alot, not the  credits:).  I don't need to say anymore about the movie, because you  probably heard it before.  I am disappointed by the behind-the-scenes  extra, however.  It answers the question of how they created the wonderful  scenes, but it's really cheap looking, and there's no interviews with the  stars.  Still, BUY IT!  You will not regret it at all.	5.0	GOD, I LuV THIS MOVIE!	1999-12-20	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A1EOKZNOVM0EXV	T	The Wachowski Brothers did a terrific job in making a film about such a topic not usually discussed: the realness of reality. The special effects are mind boggling, including a new technique known as  &quot;Bullet-Time&quot;. Invented for the Matrix specifically by a genius  of a man by the name of Mr. Gaeta. A movie that will have you thinking all  week about the realness of your spouse, your job, your car, the food you  eat, and your friends.

0790745399	The Matrix	AGLQGJ1PZGLK3	T.	This film blew my mind. My first impression was an overly-hyped special-effects ridden, money-driven movie. What I got was an awesome tour-de-force of special effects action and one of the most engaging fighting sequences of all time. The writing is not the greatest, I agree,  but it seems fitting at times for the film. I also thought that Lawrence  Fishburne as Morpheus was a perfect cast (and they were going to cast Val  Kilmer.) Carrie Ann Moss was awesome in her role along with whoever the  actor was who played the head Agent. Overly-violent at times it still has  some scenes that will stick with you for a long-time. The Matrix is one of  those movies that'll have you questioning your reality at film's end. The  Matrix is a gripping thriller with awe-inspiring special effects that is  sure to become a cult classic and will be enjoyed for years to come.	4.0	A rather intriguing film with mind-bending special effects	2000-04-23	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A17INQNCZ1HMHL	TheSnowman	I am not reviewing the movie. By now you either love it or hate it, and if you are looking here, odds are you love it. I am reviewing the Blu-ray adaptation.For a movie that revolutionized special effects, similar to T2 almost a decade earlier, I would have expected more. The Blu-ray transfer was not as good as I had hoped, but was better than DVD.The colors were amazing, as they are in most Blu-rays. However, some of the graphical details were a little grainy, as if the special effects were somewhere between DVD and Blu-ray. This is visible in the bullet-time and other slo-mo sequences, such as the firefight in the office building lobby.The sound was really good, but it was also good on the DVD. I honestly do not often notice the improved sound on Blu-rays, typically I can tell the difference in certain action scenes that make heavy use of the rear speakers (where Dolby 5.1 compresses the rears more than Blu-ray). The sound was easily at least as good as the DVD if not better.Overall this was better than the DVD, and the graphics are certainly a step above. My only gripe, and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars, is that the slo-mo sequences that were computer generated to begin with could have had more detail.	4.0	Good Blu-ray adaptation	2013-09-01	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A8M4WE1MT4R4O	thomas angelo zunich	Sheesh, where do i begin?  The Matrix is a statement on a very paranoid soceity we live in today.  With all the poisoned minds out there clutching and clinging onto worn threads of a forgotton reality, The matrix is their  salvation.  I have heard fanatics of this film calling it their  &quot;religion&quot;, I guess referring to the concepts and symols used in  the film.  Sci-fi is one thing in a realm all it's own, another time and  place.  The Matrix is not sci-fi to me.  It is paraniod delusion bordering  on insanity.  I feel sorry for people who are obsessed with this film. I  think they need a great BIG HUG.  I'm sorry, but the matrix is a fictional  account of one man's vision of how he perceives reality.  We are living in  a black and white world where no supernatural events have ever taken place  and never will.  What you see is all you get.  The only thing going on in  life is life itself and that's it!!  There is no big brother watching,  there is no alternate universe.  The Matrix is not real.  It's okay,  everything will be all right.The Matrix is a great visual spectacle  but that's about it.  The plot is far too complicated to follow and be  entertained by. The acting? Acting shmacting.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2HFQ405AKX4IW	Timothy	I have seen The Matrix several times. I think that it is one of the greatest movies ever made. It is definitely the movies which could best explain our times. If you still believe that the system you are in is real, you are completely out of your mind. Nothing about this system has lived up to its advertising and I am glad that more people are waking up. The Matrix explains the sleep that you have been in as well as any movie that I have seen and I have seen a lot of movies. The Matrix also lets you know why those in power keep you in a sleep state. Waking up can be scary for many of you, but The Matrix makes you feel good about waking up. If you were to watch The Matrix and exercise some courage, you may not reach for anti-depressants to get through each of your days. Even if you do not want to wake up the earth is awake and will not let you sleep any longer. Watch The Matrix and come out here with the rest of us who are awake already.	5.0	A Film For Our Time	2013-09-04	2	1	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A1LZVU5SRRM3VX	Timothy Michael Resh	What more can be said about this groundbreaking film?  It absolutely redefined the entire action genre, and did so with unrivaled flair and panache.  The film does for Generation Y what the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; did for the younger half of GenX.Not only are the film's special effects groundbreaking and visually stunning, but the action is superb as well.  From dazzling mid-air martial arts to bullet dodging to the shoot-em-up &quot;lobby&quot; scene, it is little wonder that this was the first DVD in my collection.  My only regret is that I never experienced this film in a theater--I saw it for the first time on fullscreen VHS, which simply does not do it justice.The movie succeeds on all levels, but perhaps the thing that most clearly indicates the greatness of this movie is that I never tire of watching it again.  The special features on bullet time and the commentary tracks are insightful and interesting, making Matrix a must-have for any DVD collection.	5.0	Defining the start of the New Millenium	2004-01-21	1	1	0

I will however tell you that I think the Matrix is the BEST sci-fi movie of all time (YES, better than Star Wars). When it hit the big screen in the late 90's to little fanfare, I went to see it. It blew me away. It was, fresh, original, had a staggering concept, good dialogue, great action, even great acting from the normally meatheaded Reeves. It was the total package for a sci-fi movie. When it was announced there would be two more, I waited anxiously...and waited...and waited...after what seemed like an eternity, the next movies hit the big screen... what the $%#?!?!The next two movies are TERRIBLE, and TOTALLY wreck the magic the first one created. The second movie doesn't even move the story forward, you can jump right to the third one and understand what's going on. The hugely awesome ending to the first one becomes the biggest anti-climax in movie history at the start of #2 too. On top of all of this, #3 is completely unsatisfying, and leaves you wondering why you wasted those extra hours of your life. I wrote this review to warn everyone who hasn't seen these movies to watch the first one but DON'T WATCH THE OTHER TWO!!!....ok, ok, I know you will anyway, but just remember: you have been warned. On a side note, the first movie stands alone perfectly as a complete story. The other two aren't necessary at all, but watch them if you wish. I only watch the first one now and am much happier to pretend the other two don't exist.The Matrix is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	5.0	The BEST Sci-Fi movie ever, BUT...	2005-11-29	8	7	1

0790745399	The Matrix	ABLBRUT8DALNN	Todd Smith	It's been over 10 years since I've seen the Matrix, and to be completely honest with you, back then, I didn't really get it the way I did this time. When the film was made it was a huge risk for the production company, as it was extremely expensive, and featured a first a time Director, using a new kind of computerized effects. 15 years later and the film is considered to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made. For those unfamiliar with the story, it takes place 200 years in the future, a time where machines have taken control of the planet and 99% of humans live in blissful ignorance, as pawns in stasis, living out there lives in a dreamworld called the Matrix. The other 1% know the truth and will do whatever it takes to defeat the machines. The crew of the Nebuchadnezzar leads the charge, following an ancient prophecy, that says they will one day discover a human with extraordinary abilities, that will lead to the destruction of the Matrix. That man is named Neo and is played by Keanu Reeves, in what many consider to be his crowning achievement. Reeves is often put down for being too dark and emotionless in his roles, but that is exactly what the role of Neo calls for, making Reeves the perfect choice to play him. Reeves is paired with veteran actor Laurence Fishburne, who as Morpheus, is like the pope of this new world. He is the one who discovered the prophecy and who risks everything for Neo. The story of the Matrix is one of the most original to come alone in decades, featuring a perfectly cast group of actors, who are aided by special effects, the likes of which had never been seen before. These effects are common place in 2014, but were unheard of in 1999, and really helped cement the reputation of this classic. The Matrix may not be the perfect movie and in fact, a lot of people won't understand it, but it's a film that people will be watching 200 years from now, when the events of the film supposedly take place.	4.0	The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078	2014-06-15	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	"THE MATRIX is the most popular film to come out in recent years and definitely the best since 1995's CASINO. It is the creation of The Wachowski Brothers who were, until this film, basically unheard of. That's changed a lot with this sci-fi/action/thriller masterpiece.THE MATRIX stars Keanu Reeves as Thomas Anderson, known to the computer world as Neo, a young computer hijacker who continues to receive messages on his computer from an unknown person involving a thing called 'The Matrix'. From there Neo is swept away from what we call reality - which turns out to be a computer-generated world created to keep us happy. What we think of as 1999 is actually closer to 2199 - and out of the ""perfect world"", it shows. The skies are black, the ground a desert, our cities crumbling (hmmm...sound familiar, i.e. THE TERMINATOR?) - and the world run by machines who create humans in fields.Woah.From the flawless special effects, the great cast, the action-packed screenplay, the commendable directing and the perfect choreography by martial arts master director Yuen Wo Ping, THE MATRIX is a non-stop thrill ride that is almost flawless. I should definitely recommend THE MATRIX to anyone looking for a good time.OVERALL: 4.5 [Masterpiece] out of 5 [Perfect]"	4.0	4.5	2003-06-07	4	2	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A9UXXVN7EDSE5	Tom B.	For four years, people had been telling me how great this movie was, but for some reason I never got around to seeing it.  Sick of people talking about it and people messing with me because I hadn't seen it, I rented the DVD, and I must say it is one of the best action flicks I have ever seen!  Unlike most films that get bragged about in today's society, this one actually lives up to expectations, if not surpasses them.  After now seeing the movies that followed this masterpiece, I must say that this has by far the strongest plot of the trilogy, since the other two focus on action more.  The characters in this movie are unforgettable, despite me not being a big fan of Reeves.  I especially think that Fisburne takes the cake with his character of Morpheous, and I think that Moss does an outstanding job as the leading lady in Trinity.  So overall, this is one movie that everyone should see and lives up to expectations!	5.0	The Matrix	2003-11-08	1	1	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A233QN6P2EEKPS	Tom Collier	"Back in 1999, before the much hyped and anticipated Star Wars Episode 1 was to be released, a little talked about and hyped science fiction movie slipped in under the radar a few months later and dazzled audiences with it's incredible fight scenes and special effects.The Matrix is about a hacker (Keanu Reeves) that discovers he is really part of a huge virtual reality where his body energy powers evil machines that have enslaved mankind. He is rescued by human rebels and told that he is ""the one""; the man that will lead humanity out of slavery. Or something. Did I mention people free of the machines had incredible powers and were constantly pursued by some very nasty machines, inside and outside of the matrix?The movie sports a plot that is much more nonsense than brain teaser, but neo-norish settings that make the computer generated backgrounds of The Phantom Menace look kiddy like in comparison. The action is wide and varied, from kung fu fights with machines to shootouts in helicopters to a particularly stunning shootout in a massive, pillar filled lobby. To get to the action, however, can somewhat test your patience, especially if you're not a fan of Keanu's deadpan style of acting. Watch the whole film once, and buy the DVD so you can skip to the action scenes."	3.0	The Matrix scores with special effects	2003-04-14	4	1	3

The fast non-stop action seems to come at you from all different angles.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a breakthrough on how action  films will be made.  Incorporating new camera techniques and experimenting  with visuals and editing.  Most people that wouldn't enjoy the fast-paced  story are stuck in Hollywood's past.  After snatching four Academy Awards  (editing, sound, visual effects and visual effects editing) you'd only hope  that types of pictures like this continue to push the envelope.	4.0	&quot;The Matrix&quot; scores with great action.	2000-06-01	1	0	1
0790745399	The Matrix	AOW9ZL781YJUN	Tom McIntosh	Classic sci-fi. Others have already well explicated it. Well written with great visuals, directing and acting, including ground-breaking visual effects. In the same league with 2001:A Space Oddysey, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan, et al.Strong Judeo-Christian themes of redemption, betrayal and the perceived world is not the ultimate reality. As Jesus said, &#34;My Kingdom is not of this world.&#34;That said, The Matrix is NOT a Christian movie. Neo does a lot of killing of people. He is not a sinless Messiah, like Jesus. More of a Moses figure; a reluctant leader appointed by God to lead His people out of bondage.This movie is NOT biblical like Ben Hur or other similar classics. Rather, it puts a technological twist on Old Testament themes that address fundamental issues of humanity, running like a river through human history. That's what makes it a classic.Some have said it can be viewed as drawing on Buddhist traditions as well. These would include the idea this earthly life does not represent the ultimate Truth or reality. The Wachowsky brothers, however, included obvious Old Testament references like naming Morpheus's ship the &#34;Nebuchadnezzar&#34; and the city of human refuge, &#34;Zion,&#34; another name for Jerusalem.Any way you slice it, it is a compelling, intriguing and well done story. Not the usual mindless Hollywood stuff.	5.0	Classic Sci-Fi	2014-04-17	0	0	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A2HB1IGHAGZNPA	Tom Mestancik	This movie left me with a lot of GOOD comments to say but I will only use a few of them since I can only use 1000 words.  First of all and I think you can all agree with me that the special effects are incredible.  I have  never seen anything like it before.  Next the storyline leaves you  speechless because even though you have seen it 100 times you still can't  quite explain what the movie means to everyone but yet it is quite simple  if you really sit down and think about it. So here it is &quot;The matrix  is a world of everything and anything combined.  We right now are not  seeing the whole truth but yet we are seeing only what the computers want  us to see.  We are really sitting inside a tube filled with goo.  When we  are born we have a choice to take a blue pill (means we can stay where we  are) or we can take a red pill (Go into the matrix).  So right now as you  are all reading this you are all sitting down and wondering what matrix  really is.  Well why wouldn't you know since you have been living in it for  your whole entire life&quot; Pretty freaky isn't it. SWEET DREAMS	4.0	This was a very good movie	1999-12-12	2	0	2
0790745399	The Matrix	ALN0TTRTLHA4E	"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick"""	The matrix is an effective and interesting film. The reason for this is that it is succesful at two levels. The first level is that it creates an artificial world which it gradually explains. This world is based on an original view of the future and is a plausable basis for an action film. The second level is that this is an effective action adventure film set in that world. The dialogue is effective for an action film and not embarrasing. The plot is taunt and gets you in.The roles are all played well and both Keanu Reeves and the female lead are great. The action scenes are tremendous and you can watch them again and again.This film will no doubt have a number of follow ups and make the cast and director a lot of money.

Or they probably dont see that many movies.  Its not an original plot(hello, dark city),and it has a very lame and  predictable script. It also has a very high cheese factor. It is a good  action flick regardless, and has mind blowing effects.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2L2VG7PRBN4Y2	Tom Scholfield	This movie was fantastic, I saw it first day first show and almost no one was in the theatre, this shows you that almost no one was waiting in line because of MTV.  I don't even watch MTV, the special effects are absolutley  amazing it would take the academy award if it was not for star wars.  The  sound is amazing to, since sound is 50 percent of the movie this plays a  very important role, it would win best sound to if it wasn't for Star Wars.  All these reviewers that hate this movie do not know what they are talking  about.  Sure you might not go to this movie because of its drama, or  because of the romance, if you want pure adrenaline pumping action and non  stop thrills see this movie, if you don't trust me rent it when it comes  out you'll see.  I have been watching movies all my life and yes The Matrix  copy's off of many other sci-fi, action and kung-fu movies but it does not  try to hide it.  The Matrix takes all the elements of all the great action,  sci-fi and kung-fu movies and splices them together and it does it  seemlesly.  See this movie, it blew me away from opening to end, I saw it  six times in the theatre, it got better every time.  It will blow you away  too.P.S. Look for the GIANT BUNNIES on the television  at the  oracles house.	5.0	Amazing, Great, I Loved It, I Give It a High Five	1999-08-17	0	0	0

The Matrix, the codirecting Wachowski brothers Andy and Larry annihilated any suggestion of a sophomore jinx. How's this for a premise? There are two realities: one that consists of the life we live every day - and one that lies behind it. One is a dream. The other is The Matrix. Set in the not too distant future in an insipid, characterless city, we find a young man named Neo (Keanu Reeves). A software techie by day and a computer hacker by night, he sits alone at home by his monitor, waiting for a sign, a signal--from what or whom he doesn't know until one night, a mysterious woman named Trinity seeks him out and introduces him to that faceless character he has been waiting for: Morpheus. A messiah of sorts, Morpheus presents Neo with the truth about his world by shedding light on the dark secrets that have troubled him for so long. Ultimately, Morpheus illustrates to Neo what the Matrix is a reality beyond reality that controls all of their lives, in a way that Neo can barely comprehend. Neo thus embarks on an adventure that is both terrifying and enthralling. Pitted against an enemy that transcends human concepts of evil, Morpheus and his team must train Neo to believe that he is the chosen champion of their fight.

MATRIX is the essence and epitome ofstyle...not substance.Through a seamless symbiotic blending ofdiverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360 sequentialsurround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executedhuman action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a truere-definition of the cinematic experience, on their ownterms. Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with theirsignature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world muchmore convincing than any drug-induced one.MATRIX clearly speaks tous in a newly formatted cinematic language.

I'm sure  we all agree that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor on the planet.  I like  some of his movies, and dislike others.  Yet I cannot imagine any other  actor in the role of Neo.  He was perfect!  He and the rest of the cast  were ... words cannot describe.  What a movie! What a concept!  I've never  seen anything like it!!I especially liked the still/moving action  sequences--and the kung fu fighting scenes.  What an ending!!!!  I loved  walking out of the theater excited, thinking about how Neo stopped those  bullets, and talking about this great movie with my husband on the way home  in the car.

The director has a way of making you feel like you are part of  the action. He puts you right up close to what is happening, making it  almost as if you are that character.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2GQ81OSLTLEKX	Trick009	I'd never had a strong motivation to see 'The Matrix', my taste in science fiction (and science in general) tending more towards space and nature than cyberpunk hijinks. But as a college student, last semester my history professor was obsessed with it, comparing it to the allegory of the cave, the scientific revolution, Nietzsche, Baudrillard, etc. Being fascinated by all of said topics, and feeling the need to round out my film knowledge, I rented it on here (for three dollars! thanks amazon!) and was totally underwhelmed. 'The Matrix' reeks of 1999(my childhood), with a typical rebellious young genius not being understood, then being recruited to an underground movement, etc. The main philosophical idea presented is the ancient 'brain-in-a-vat' idea, so what one is left with are action scenes. Not bad ones, but not great ones either. So know what you're getting into; a brightly-lit, late-90s action movie with a well-paced plot nothing more.	3.0	Incredibly overrated, but still fun.

0790745399	The Matrix	A1REA1DRDAO3YF	trish	This movie really hit home to me. I am always searching for the truth in life. Is there anything more important to any of us than trying to find out who we are and why we are here at this time and place. It is always in the back of our minds. We try to escape it for a while by doing mundane (but we think they are important) tasks. We may not all be super-heroes. But this movie helps in an essence for us to live out the fantasy and find the &quot;truth&quot;.  I saw this movie first in the theatre, bought the VHS &amp; when the VCR ate my tape-I went to DVD.When I left the theatre for weeks I had to ponder the meanings. There are so many levels to this movie I had to wonder if my life was a dream. I'm sure Buddha would have thought the same. (I'm not Buddhist) I have seen plenty of psuedo references to other religions in this movie. Wide range!!!And I must say this is one of the best! I was a little hesitant after Johnny Mnemonic (but I think that was more of the fault of the budget running low before the end, didn't get it all as it was intended).  This was NOTHING like it! THIS WAS A MUST HAVE FOR ME AND I HAVE SEEN IT MORE THAN 30X's!!! The DVD has some great extra features!! And even more so if you have a DVD Rom, but if you don't have the DVD-ROM yet it is definetly worth the cost. You will get a lot of use out of it!

0790745399	The Matrix	AZA82N475EHHA	T.Rob	The cool thing about this movie is that it explains so much.  If the premise of the movie were true, i.e. that our &quot;reality&quot; is only a simulation, then everything that is supernatural, paranormal or  extra-sensory becomes plausible.  Think you're being watched?  You are.  Can Yuri Geller really melt a spoon?  In this world, definitely  &quot;yes&quot;.  Deja Vu?  Just a glitch in the matrix.  Think everything  tastes like chicken?  That's because it does.  You think the rules don't  apply to you?  Maybe they don't.  The movie challenges our perceptions and  the very notions of awareness and sentience.  &quot;I think, therfore I  am&quot; becomes &quot;I think, therefore I may be&quot;.  Nothing can be  taken for granted inside the Matrix.The DVD is an extra treat.  The  movie itself is perfect for DVD with it's excellent use of Dolby 5.1  Digital and great special effects.  In addition, you will want to watch  with the commentary turned on at least once and definitely watch at least  once with the white rabbit feature turned on.In the Matrix, it turns out  that the fringe elements of society - the lunatics, the paranormals, the  misfits - were right all along and the folks in the mainstream who had  achieved some measure of conventional success turned out to be the mindless  automatons.  This explains the wide spectrums of ratings in the reviews for  this movie.  Many, many people &quot;get it&quot;.  Many do not.  To the  latter group I say &quot;Wake up copper top!  The Matrix has you.&quot;	5.0	Wake up copper top!	2000-07-24	4	2	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A123FC8GL7US1O	Troy	"""No one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" says Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the earnest, elegant John the Baptist figure in the Wachowski brothers' allegorical science fiction masterpiece. Well, we'll give it a shot.He's talking to Neo (Keanu Reeves), a blank-faced computer whizz who's about to go through the looking glass - out of the late 20th century world as he knows it, into the real, post-apocalyptic ""desert of the real"".It's a reality where robots rule the planet and keep humans plugged into a virtual reality matrix, living in a dream world, while their energy fuels the machines.Morpheus thinks Neo is The One, the messiah figure who will destroy the Matrix and resurrect humanity. Fellow freedom fighter Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is convinced too. But Neo isn't certain, and will have to face the pernicious, powerful, Matrix meanie Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) to find out.At first viewing, the action sequences stun, but there's more to this than the groundbreaking ""bullet time"" photography, or the adolescent allure of flash, black clothes and big, black guns.Sure, ""The Matrix"" is almost untenably cool, but beneath the sheen there's substance. The story's a potent mix of buddhism, Greek mythology, and - predominantly - the Christian gospel.The image of a superficial existence, where ignorant people thrive by blocking out a troublesome reality, is potent for a Western society drowning in wealth while the rest of the world suffers.The performances, too, wow. Admittedly Reeves is gifted the perfect role - he has to look good while hitting things - but Moss is charismatic, clever and sexy, while Fishburne is monumental.Nestling next to ""The Terminator"" and ""Metropolis"", this is one the finest sci-fi flicks ever made.What is ""The Matrix""? It's genius. And yes, we admit, you do have to see it for yourself."	5.0	Great Action movie	2003-11-23	3	2	1

This is a definite BUY recommendation.  It's one of my favorite films.I saw this the first time in a sparsely occupied theatre.  And it really was a random pick at the dollar show, because I hadn't heard anything about it during its first release at the larger theatres.  When the film was over, I was in awe.  It was probably the coolest things I had ever seen on screen.  I was blown away.  How many films (in your lifetime, even) do that to you???To try to explain the story would be too difficult and confusing here.  Let me just say that it's set in the future and machines and software are ruling the earth.  Now, what does that tell you?  Not much, huh?  Even to the people in The Matrix, they had to experience it to get an understanding of it.  And even then...Keannu Reeves is perfect for this role.  His cool attitude really fits the character.  Hugo Weaving is great as Agent Smith.  Really, the whole cast is good.The cinematography, colors, costumes, sets, and special effects are great.  And there's loads of special effects.  Some of which have been copied ad nauseum since its release.  It's fast-paced, engrossing, and intellectual.  That's pretty rare.It was directed by the Wachowski brothers.  They also directed Bound, another under-rated film.  Although the transition to The Matrix was pretty phenomenal.  I can't imagine how they'll top this with the sequel.  A major reason why this was so awesome was that it was so original.Granted, seeing it on the big screen and seeing it on your tv is a big difference, but nowhere near worth downgrading it.  It's still an awesome.  And the DVD is loaded with interesting extras.  Buy it.	5.0	Are you the one?	2002-12-17	2	0	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A2YI2K3ZYQZDX6	Tumbling down the rabbit-hole	"I have seen many reviews on 'The Matrix' that don't discuss what makes it such a kick-ass movie. I don't know if it is because people are too ignorant to see past the kung-fu or it is really that hard to grasp.'The Matrix' is NOT a remake of any other movie (see some review below) and it is NOT an easy movie to watch and grasp. I believe that this is an underground movie, that appeals to the masses due to the action, because unless you really sit down and turn on the subtitles, you miss what makes 'The Matrix' so awesome. People have said to me before that the first hour sucks because there isn't much action but in all truth, it is the first hour that contains the philosophical elements, biblical allusions, and backgorunds that leave you totally awestruck.I have also seen reviews that say the acting sucked, which is total bull, because many have played their best roles to date in this movie.All in all, please don't watch this movie unless you want a deep, thought-provoking movie, because if you sit down to see the action, you miss the parts of the movie that took the most work and thought. If you watch it with an open mind, you will become transfixed like I was in the thought that went into the screenplay and cinematics.Once you understand what i am talking about, the movie will make sense, and so will the fact that the Wachowski brothers have created a masterpiece that should rank in the top ten in our movie libraries for a long time.Don't forget to listen to the commentaries, watch the extras, 'take the red pills,' and follow the White Rabbit.""I can only show you the door, you must open it for yourself.""-Morpheus"	5.0	Awesome movie	2003-06-02	0	0	0

The music soundtrack is loud but not  deafening.What really make the disc stand out are the extra features.  (Curiously, there are no movie trailers included, although if you have a  DVD-ROM player, you can access the website directly.)  There is a feature  on the making of &quot;The Matrix,&quot; but that's only the beginning.  The &quot;Red Pill&quot; feature is a short feature on the way they filmed  &quot;bullet time,&quot; which is the slow motion yet not slow motion film  technique.  The &quot;White Rabbit&quot; feature is the best; the entire  movie runs, but at certain key sequences -- those where you really want to  know, &quot;How did they do that?&quot; -- a white rabbit blinks on the  screen.  If you trigger the DVD remote, you get whisked to another short  documentary on how the scene was filmed.As for the movie, it's  outstanding as well.	5.0	The best reason to own a DVD player	1999-12-09	1	1	0

0790745399	The Matrix	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	After watching THE MATRIX recently in preparation for seeing the upcoming sequel, I was amazed once again. THE MATRIX is a hallmark film; like JAWS, STAR WARS, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, it is a movie that has influenced almost every film made since its release and changed the way movies are made. The special effects are spectacular, the action intense, and the plot extremely well-written.However, all that withstanding, what really makes THE MATRIX stand out from other sci-fi/action films is the philosophical and allegorical slant of the story. The film is immersed in the philosophy and religion of the West, embodying everything from Plato to the Bible. That fact makes this much more than a &quot;dumb movie about cyberspace&quot; or &quot;another movie about machines&quot;.  Instead, THE MATRIX is a thinking person's movie, a movie that is not only interesting to watch but that also raises questions and thoughts that a person thinks about long after the final credits have rolled across the screen.Finally, THE MATRIX is the first film where Keneau Reeves acts. Until THE MATRIX, Reeves was such a poor actor that he could never quite leave behind his &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; persona (if you've ever seen MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, you'll know what I mean).	5.0	Keeping It Real.	2003-05-07	18	15	3

It blew my mind the first time I watched it. My jaw dropped during that first opening scene and to this day, the effects can't be matched. We all know Keanu Reeves cant really act, but he picks his roles wisely. I mean, no acting required really for this role. Well, I'm mostly just kidding. His committment to the film cant be denied.

0790745399	The Matrix	A35L2E8M7S59MQ	V. Berk	"Beginning this review I was writing the film's title and ended up with ""The Mainstream"" (100% accident) which pretty much sums up the premise of The Matrix franchise.  The Matrix is good in the fact that it takes complex science-fiction from previous 1990s films that didn't quite meet mainstream audiences (Dark City, 12 Monkeys) and merges it with the spectacular CGI effects of an action film.  As an action film The Matrix is incredibly successful and deserves great recognition as one of the best films of the 1990s, or the past two decades for that matter.  However I do feel let down by the fact that I felt cheated by the story when they didn't try to further flesh out the world it took place in.My main problem with the film falls on the fact that, as an avid sci-fi fan, I had already seen most of the concepts The Matrix presented in previous films (go back to the two I listed above).  The religious spin on things however does really make it interesting, kind of like a science-fiction version of some religious document, but a human being having special abilities and saving a captive human population from a controlling force which had everyone living in a false reality had already been used in Dark City back in 1996.  This, among other things, is one of the reasons I don't give The Matrix a perfect score of 10/10.As a sci-fi film it was very good, regardless of how many of the elements that it was reusing from other films, but I often felt like the production team couldn't decide on whether or not they wanted an action picture, or a thought stimulating sci-fi epic.  By the end however The Matrix does succeed in balancing these two things very nicely.  The CGI deserved its Academy Award, because it really is amazing some of the things they were able to pull off.The acting in this film was grade-A, and one of the strongest aspects of the film's production, and there was only ONE performance that failed to catch my attention...sadly this performance (my opinion) came from the star of the film: Keanu Reeves.  Reeves has had his moments throughout his career, don't get me wrong, back in the late 1980s (most will remember the Bill & Ted films) he was a rather likable young actor, even in his lesser known performances; he seemed very honest and sincere in his performances.  A change came about when he announced he was going to ""take acting more seriously"".  The result, in my mind, was horrific!  He comes across now as someone with very little emotion, and just doesn't seem really human.I had the same problem with Keanu in the action movie, Speed, which followed the Die Hard franchise, but unlike Bruce Willis, I couldn't connect, or really care about Reeves in this film (similar feeling in Bram Stoker's Dracula, but he wasn't TOO bad in that film), which was certainly on par with the Die Hard films in production and story.  Same problem is present in The Matrix.  Reeves is trying way too hard to seem serious, and dramatic, and in the end comes across as being artificial, and dull.  If that was the director's intention, I don't really care, because I felt this was a character the audience should have been able to relate to and care about, but that's just my opinion and you don't have to agree with me (just giving an honest view from my perspective).Okay, I've given my criticisms, but now I have to say what was really good about The Matrix, and there are a lot of good aspects of this film which is why it deserves my high rating (and a spot in my DVD collection).  The action is well-done, and truly is an eye opener, and as I previously stated the performances are mostly strong.  Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) are very good in their respective roles, and both (as most people will say) are embraced as engaging characters in the mind of the audience, while Reeves was more of a vehicle to channel elaborate action sequences (the highlight, in most people's opinion, of the film).  Also the Wachowski Brother's film is simply beautiful to look at, from the all CGI sequences to the live sets.  The sequels, which go purely into action, prove that this film could have been a much worse (I don't hate the sequels, they just are not really sci-fi; just action films).This film really does have all it needs to work as a successful film, especially in the mainstream Hollywood of this day and age.  It would have been braver for the filmmakers to try and expand, and concentrate on the complex science-fiction aspects, instead of the action, but then it wouldn't have been the box-office success it was.  I would defend them no matter what, but when you go against the powers if mainstream and the production companies and end up with a good film you'll always have me backing up your film...of course I will be critical if the plot and direction is bad, but at least I'll give you a positive word for daring to be different.I can only hope that The Matrix can help get moviegoers into the lesser known art-house science-fiction stories that inspired it, because it's a shame that our modern audiences can't seem to appreciate things that don't fuse with action or comedy, because I don't feel science-fiction was ever really intended to be a genre simply designed to create exciting action sequences.The Matrix was a great film, deserving its mainstream applause: Solid 9/10 stars"	5.0	Action movie disguised as science-fiction delivers the goods	2008-11-05	1	0	1

They play three human resistence fighters on a future planet Earth dominated by thinking machines that have enslaved humanity in the most insidious way possible, by creating the matrix... a prison for their minds.Dazzling martial arts, dizzying special effects, a plot that questions our entire concept of 'real', an awesome soundtrack/score, and great acting all made &quot;The Matrix&quot; a cultural phenomenon that hasn't been seen since the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; over twenty years ago.

UGH!)this one fantastic movie, in and of it's own accord, justifies their having a place of prominence in the pantheon of the all time great producers / directors in movie making history.Being an intelligent, thoughtful, highly analytical and conscious individual, the mental stimulation which I derived from this finely nuanced film was enough to make me giddy.With a superb cast; great acting; a mind-boggling plot; and dialogue that you can sink your teeth into; THE MATRIX gives the viewer a whole lot of everything.But, for me, the one thing that it gave me more than anything else, was a sense of empowerment.The sense that if we can conceive it and BELIEVE it, that we can also achieve it; and in essence, this film is really just one long testament to my favorite philosophical axiom; one which states that, ""The person who thinks that they can, and the person who thinks that they can't, are both right."" and for every single character in this movie, it was all about that one simple thing: 'belief'.Morpheus, the leader of the group, who was played to perfection by Lawrence Fishburn, BELIEVED so strongly that he would find the one, that he had devoted his entire life to searching for him.Trinity, played by Carrie Ann Moss, believed so strongly in Morpheus, that she risked her life time and time again, delving into the matrix as a liaison between Morpheus and 'the one'.Cypher, played by Hugo Weaving, believed that their search was so much B.S. that he sold out to the agents, attempting to sabotage the groups efforts, for his own personal welfare.NEO, played by keanu Reeves, believed that he was 'just another guy' until the collective belief of everyone around him, particularly Morpheus and Trinity, convinced him that he really was 'the one.'This movie is so tightly constructed that even the names of these individuals tell a story that is relative to it's character.Morpheus is the name of 'the principal God of dreams' in Greek mythology, and in The Matrix, Morpheus attempts to wake everyone from their dream state.Trinity represents the power of alliance, particularly the alliance of three, as in the sun the moon and the stars, the father the son and the holy ghost, life death and rebirth, past present and future, etc... and she serves as the link between Morpheus' ideology, and it's real life application in the embodiment of Neo.Neo, literally means 'NEW', and is also an anagram for ONE, and he would be the first person to see The Matrix as it really was, and he would also be the the first ONE to take a step into the heart of THE MATRIX and live to tell.Even the name of their vessel, the Nebuchadnezzar, was symbolic, in the regards that Nebuchadnezzar was the name of the Babylon king who rebelled against Darius the great of Persia, who was the most powerful ruler of his 5th century B.C times.This s**t is the macrocosm in microcosm, finely nuanced in every detail; and, in fact, if you really want to experience this movie from another perspective, DON""T WATCH IT... LISTEN TO IT.""SOUND BYTES""NEO: ""So what are you telling me... that I can dodge bullets?""MORPHEUS: ""No! When you're ready... you won't have to.""When Neo is preparing to jump From one skyscraper to another, and has doubts about his ability to do so, Morpheus tells him, ""Don't think you can... know you can.""When Neo tries to convince himself that he can make that jump, he declares, ""NO FEAR, NO DOUBT, NO DISBELIEF.""And for anyone who is wondering if they should watch/buy this DVD; and whether or not it's worth their time and money?Take it from me, (someone who isn't prone to gushing effusively about anything; though you wouldn't know that based on this review) you should have ""NO FEAR... NO DOUBT... NO DISBELIEF.""THE MATRIX is THE ONE."	5.0	"""No Fear, No Doubt, No Disbelief."""	2008-09-04	4	2	2
0790745399	The Matrix	A3LZ4IH8Z6MNGN	"V. Nagy ""Toadberry"""	The Matrix is a run of the mill summer movie that for some strange reason gained a cult following. I swear, I really didn't hate The Matrix at the beginning. It was a summer movie, entertaining for the duration of the show, forgettable afterwards.Keanu Reeves is well suited to play stiff, blank-faced humanoid type characters in science fiction movies... well, because he can just be himself, and all that effort of acting is not getting in his way. So he wasn't the problem. I have enjoyed watching Hugo Weaving in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Proof, so that was a definate plus. The special effects were a bit too self-satified and flashy, but who cares, give the masses eye-candy.No, what put me off was the mass hysteria that followed. Have you ever seen pictures of screaming teenage girls at a Beatles concert? It was like that, but with grown men. There was a guy, whom I previously considered reasonable, explaining to me how this movie just blew his mind, how incredibly original and philosophically deep it was. I was looking at him wondering what on earth he was talking about. The philosophy of this movie has the depth of a kiddie pool. Everything in it is covered in your average Philosophy 101 class - you know, the one that the graduate students teach, because the professor has better things to do. The plot, once you brush off the SFX glitter is nothing Hollywood haven't regurgitated million times before. As matter of fact, it is the standard Reluctant Hero plot: shy young boy/man is told that he is special, The One. He at first rejects the idea, but of course eventually gives in and ends up saving the day/world/Princess Leia/etc.The endless gushings about The Matrix finally made me just really hate the movie, and boycotting all the follow-ups. I'm still stupefied by all the hubbub.	1.0	Overrated	2009-05-20	59	8	51

0790745399	The Matrix	A3QJP3U268J21B	"""volsee2"""	This a descent movie, and one of the few &quot;remakes&quot; that actually gives the original a run for its money.  This movie is obviously based on &quot;Dark City.&quot;  &quot;The Matrix&quot; has more special effects than &quot;Dark City,&quot; but the plot is basically the same.  A man learns that the life he has known is a farce and that the entire world is being run by a higher sentenance.  As he learns more and more about the world, he is being hunted by those that want to keep the status quo.While &quot;The Matrix&quot; stands on its own two legs, so to speak, the legs are different than the original.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; leans heavily on spectacular effects and a decent plot, &quot;Dark City&quot; relies on strong acting and plotline.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a great movie that you don't have to think very hard to follow, and &quot;Dark City&quot; is a superb movie you have to pay close attention to in order to follow.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3S8L98OORN2KF	Vstmxo	In this movie, the Wachowskis obviously have a ball working out the technical details of the photography and the digital effects. There's a nice gloss and attention to detail that's lacking in many other films. The brothers have an eye for small details, such as reflections and color tints. What The Matrix lacks is any real intelligence. As an synthesis of comic books, sci-fi, and Hong Kong action movies, The Matrix is just fine. But it's nevertheless disappointing that it lacks an intellectual core--any originality of thought or explication. As other reviews point out, authors such as Philip K. Dick and William Gibson have already trekked down this path with much more thoughtfulness. The bottom line is that The Matrix is fun to watch, much like a Saturday morning cartoon, but does not merit the adoration it seems to engender. If you love The Matrix, I suggest that you head down to your local used bookstore and thumb through the sci-fi rack. There's alot more where The Matrix came from.	3.0	Crafty filmmaking lacking substance	2004-02-29	5	3	2

0790745399	The Matrix	A14RVP4U2NR8BJ	"Wade D. Haynes ""postmodern_pundit"""	I have read about half of the reviews for this movie and there seems to be an overwhelming consensus that this is the best science fiction movie ever made.  I beg to differ.  2001: A Space Odyssey, Brazil, Gattaca, and Bladerunner are better contenders for that title.  Most reviewers are quick to point out the innovative special effects and the &quot;complicated&quot; plot rewarded by multiple viewings.  Well, I cannot argue about the effects, that's where all three stars come from.  They are superb, if not a bit overdone.  I can't help but think that this movie is nothing but a long music video.  Maybe that's why it's such a crowd pleaser.  I found the plot a bit irritating for my tastes.  I suppose it is because I am somewhat familiar with science fiction motiffs that I cannot find this movie daringly original.  Unlike most reviewers who had to watch the movie so many times to &quot;get it,&quot; I already had the ending pegged halfway through.  The plot is not complicated except to the lazy-minded with attention spans that approach infinitely close to zero.  The script is a pile of not-so-subtle religious allegory heaped with a bit of watered-down Baudrillard, some pseudo-Eastern philosophy, and tons of science fiction cliche.  What annoys me the most about this film (aside from the typical-love-conquers-all ending) is the way it pretends to make grandiose statements on such profound topics as the nature of reality, man vs. machine, and conformity, when all it really turns out to be is an action flick dressed up in pseudo-intellectual garb.  The &quot;ideas&quot; in this movie are grossly underdeveloped and though new to most, are actually centuries-old concepts and questions.  I would like to say that this movie might be an entry point into an engaging intellectual discourse, but I know that most viewers will not bother to look too far into the traces of philosophy and literature littered throughout this film.  More likely, they will just watch it again and again for its special effects and remain content with the sketchy patchwork of ideas that are simply COOL, FAR-OUT, TRIPPY, or MIND-BLOWING.  In this way, the film fails as a philosophical and/or allegorical investigation.  The effects are so &quot;COOL&quot; that they overshadow the limited intellectual content of the movie.  Most viewers would rather wait for that kick-a** sequel or a Matrix video game than actually pick up a book and read.  The allegory and symbolism are applied so heavy-handedly that the viewer doesn't even have to think all that hard.  All in all, we have a great action movie with some good effects, but little else to offer, especially in the thought department. ALL FORM, NO CONTENT.	3.0	EYE CANDY.  PSEUDO-INTELLECTUALISM.

0790745399	The Matrix	A2V8Q6IQ602H4O	wcc2	I am a huge fan of the Matrix having seen it three times in the theatres and now having my own copy, but I figured that I was the target demographic. What surprised me was how uniformly engaging the Matrix is - I  was standing in a long line in the video store check out with the Matrix  playing on the in-store displays. These could not be the target demographic  - the people in front of me were getting a Disney movie; in front of them a  foreign film; and several others in front of them. While the wait was long,  no one seemed to be in a rush since everyone was fixated on the Matrix. And  this is Manhattan, New York City, where we are typically an impatient  bunch.The particular sequence that was holding us all captive was a  shoot-out in a building's lobby. The hero and heroine take on and overcome  many bad guys with some great gun-play and acrobatics. There is great  initial framing and the stunts and action are truly impressive. Having seen  this sequence many times myself at home in slow-mo, I was watching everyone  else in line - their necks were all craned, not a word was spoken. I've  never seen another movie hold everyone's attention so completely.This is  only one of several fantastic action sequences. And what makes this movie  great is the consistency of the plot and elements of the story, which other  reviewers have noted in detail.  As evidence of this consistency, as a  challenge see if you can answer this: &quot;In the last action sequence  with two other agents chasing Keanu Reeves, Agent Smith knows to head  directly for a particular building and room. How does he know to pre-empt  Keanu Reeves by heading straight to this room while the other agents simply  chase?&quot; If you can't answer this question, you haven't seen the movie  enough times.	5.0	Mesmerizing Action Sequences	2000-06-06	2	1	1

The Matrix is by far the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The non-stop action mixed with drama and suspense is a killer,  and the plot line keeps moving at a very fast pace. I went back to see it  again, and found that there were many things I had missed the first time.  Even if you do not like action movies, you will love The Matrix. Also,  despite popular opinion, this movie is NOT gory at all. There is very  little blood shown, except for one or two scenes. The plot line also really  gets you thinking. I'm not saying that any of that is REAL, but it at least  makes you think about it. I left the movie the first time with adrenalin  pumping through my veins and an unimaginable about of ideas going through  my head. And Carrie Ann Moss - she's hot, she's spontaneous, she's an  awesome actress, and she is a major contributing character to both the plot  and the action of the movie - what more can I say? Keanu Reeves has another  great part in this movie, and the Agents - what can I say? They're cunning,  ruthless, and very well played. The entire movie is phenomenal - I assure  you, you will not get bored. If you've already seen this movie, see it  again. If you haven't seen it yet, WHAT ARE YOU DOING READING THIS!? GO SEE  IT! I would definitely recommend this movie in any format you can get - I'm  planning on getting it in DVD, VHS, and anything else I can (maybe two  copies in case one breaks). I don't know how else to describe this movie,  so I'll say it again - THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!

This problem occures when Cypher makes a deal with the &quot;Machines&quot; Cypher goes into the matrix and has a sitdown meeting with the agents.  The problem is you can't get into the matrix from the ship, without an operator, who monitors everything that is going on around you in the matrix.  That means someone else on board was in on the sell out to the Matrix, or it is a bloop in the film!  Most people I've talked to hadn't noticed this slight problem, but after pointing it out I see the light bulb appear over thier heads.  Overall this is a great movie, Awesome special effects, great acting, Solid plot except that one blooper.  Buy it, and love it. It is a work of art.	4.0	lost a star	2003-06-20	1	1	0
0790745399	The Matrix	AH7UDG89WBTZU	"William Meikle ""Willie"""	"SF Movies have suffered from a lack of style in recent years. There's only so many times you can see Bladerunner or Alien ripped off cheaply before you start to get jaded. And it doesn't help that they keep casting muscular dolts with the intellect of a plank in violent revenge fantasies that do little more than ape the ""Death Wish"" movies.So it's three cheers for The Matrix, the film that restored my faith in SF movies.It starts with a bang, a chase across rooftops with some spectacular leaps that make you realise that wherever you are, it's not the world you live in.Or is it?Neo (or is that Neophyte?) is a programmer by day in a faceless corporation, and a hacker by night, searching for Morpheus, a shadowy figure who may hold the key to Neo's longings for a different world. Morpheus on the other hand is looking for a Saviour, someone who will come and lead the oppressed masses to a new Utopia.Soon their paths cross, and Neo is shown the real world, a world that is not all he thought it to be. In this world everything is run by ""The Matrix"", a super computer that controls everything and everybody, body and soul. (Or, as the Oracle so succinctly puts it, ""Balls to Bones"")Neo is removed from the system's influence, and is told he is ""The One"", the long-prophesised saviour who can remake the Matrix to his own will. He is trained in how to fight the Matrix defense programs (or ""Agents"".....software that takes the guise of super-powerful humans and can take control of anybody still hooked up to the Matrix)To accomplish this he is given a crash course in martial arts in a manner that would be great if it were possible today (I can imagine the ads - ""Learn Kung-Fu in thirty seconds....no philosophising necessary!"") . Once he reintroduces himself to the Matrix's world the stage is set for some climactic fight scenes, among the best ever seen in cinema history.To say more would be to give away too much of the plot, but suffice to say The Matrix is one of the biggest, most explosive, most stylish SF films ever.It succeeds where lesser films fail by melding a hi-tech glossy look with martial arts battles familar to Hong-Kong film lovers, and overlaying the whole thing with a mythic plot of the Saviour who is slowly coming to realise his destiny.Even the names hold a mythic quality to them, from Morpheus, the god of sleep who knows who is dreaming and who is awake, to Cipher who is not all he seems, to Trinity, the embodiment of child, mother and lover and finally Neo, the classic neophyte trying to find a path through the mysteries. The ancient Greeks would have had no trouble in following the basics of this story.Reeves has never been better, portraying confusion and frailty one minute, strength and resolve the next. But it is Fishburne's movie....it is his presence that holds the whole thing together and keeps you rivetted to your seat.All that and a shadowing of a peril coming to Zion, the last stronghold of the true believers, and we're all set up for a blockbuster of a sequel. I can't wait.Couple that with an outstanding directors talk-over, and an ingenious ""follow the white rabbit"" extras feature that lets you cut in and view how any particular effect or stunt was achieved, and you have a DVD that's hard to ignore for quality, quantity and entertainment.All that, loads of black leather gear, big boots and guns. What more do you want?And any film that contains a clip of the cult classic ""Night of the Lepus"" is always going to be worth a look."	5.0	Restored my faith in SF Movies	2003-04-21	5	4	1

""The Matrix"" is certainly one of my ten favorite movies ever.And many reviews are available praising the picture quality and sound quality of the movie as presented in this particular package, ""The Matrix 10th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Book [Blu-ray]."" The picture is nearly flawless, save occasional graininess. The sound is demo-worthy, especially if you have a TrueHD receiver. There are dozens of hours of great previously released extras, almost all of it in standard definition. Plus there is a new ""picture in picture"" mode that's quite interesting.I have only two small observations for you to consider as you prepare to buy this disc (of course you *will* buy this disc, because it's stupid to pay three times more for the ultimate collection, and because you want this great flick in your library in high definition). First observation: the ""book"" included with the disc is nothing more than marketing fluff and will not be of interest to...well, to anyone. For a great Matrix book you can really sink your teeth into, check out ""The Art of the Matrix"" edited by Spencer Lamm.Second, every time you put this disc in your Blu-Ray player, you will be treated like a criminal with the following message. Every time.SUPPORT ANTI-PIRACYFIVE YEARS IN FEDERAL PRISONDO NOT COPY, DISTRIBUTE OR PUBLICLY EXHIBIT MOVIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS, INCLUDING UPLOADING AND DOWNLOADING MOVIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS OVER THE INTERNET.

0790745399	The Matrix	A3JFVPN5440PXC	"Willy Chenja Du ""wndrr"""	True, this movie DID emulate some antecedent sci-fi, action, thriller filcks and all, but the film we saw (and repetitiously enjoy, hopefully) is still undeniably a peice of delicious eye-candy is it not?  Yes, there were sporadic incidents which the W-bros used techniques that were seen in other movies (i.e. the scene when Neo touched the broken glass and became something remeniscient of the liquid-metel T-1000 in T-2.  i.e. #2, in the showdown between Neo and Agent Smith in the subway where they both exhaust their clips and acknowlege it at an identical moment, which showcased the highlight from the opening Face/off gunfight between two flamboyant actors...), but so what?  This doesn't take any pleasure away from the viewer and it pays tributes to 2 of the most explosive action films ever made, what is condemnable about that?  For you critical movie-goers out there, just consider all the inferior films in which you busted a communsurate 8 bucks to watch, and for you extremely critical reviewers who diss this movie just because its a genuine crowd pleaser and HAS an abundance of SE's, I advise you to write a critical essay on some other sci-fi action wanna-be that's really worth your effort (i.e. Battlefield Earth, The Avengers, etc.).  The Matrix definitely earned itself a place in this over-apreciated genre by smoothly combining thought-provoking elements from others.  By the way, for those of you that like The Matrix will surely appreciate Pitch Black as well.  Thx for reading this!	5.0	come on guys, just enjoy this fabulous film	2001-05-10	1	0	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A2F5M1L96BKBMX	Wine Guy	Good movie, wonderful technically, defined the state of the art in special effects. As science fiction, though, it's preposterous garbage. The premise is banal in the extreme: people lying in pods in a perpetual dream state  provide energy to run the computer overlords' machines, while the good guys  lurk in a futuristic-but-funky submarine in giant underground sewers. This  is the sort of crap that gives sci-fi a bad name. Why in the world didn't  they hire someone like Bruce Sterling, or William Gibson, or Greg Bear to  provide some intelligent background?Ah well, enjoy it for what it is, I  guess; it shore is purty!	3.0	good movie, ridiculous story	2000-05-01	1	0	1

It is pure genius, &quot;virtually&quot; flawless, and  what &quot;flaws&quot; you find are the directors' intentional reminders of  the importance of being human. &quot;The Oracle&quot; will back me up on  this. :^)Bravissimo to the new W.

0790745399	The Matrix	A355BEQHVY69XN	wiz@tampabay.rr.com	I think that most people that don't like this movie just didn't get it.  The thought that there is some other force guiding our lives and actions - a dream within a dream - is a common story theme but in The Matrix, the  Wachowski Bro's really take this concept to a new level.Whether you  liked the movie, understood it, or not, its still worth noting that this is  one of the best examples of DVD technology to date.  Not only is the film  transferred superbly in both widescreen video and 5.1 audio, the extra  features are nothing short of astounding!From several behind the scenes  videos, to multiple full-length audio commentaries, even pc-dvd-rom  features, the disc is innovatively designed to entertain far beyond the  running time of the standard film.

It seemed to be a breat of fresh air that the sci-fi realm needed (especially with Episode I being a disappointment).  I normally don't like Keanu but he did really well in this one, and Carrie-Ann Moss was exceptional.  I really love the way this flick starts out because you don't really know what's going on and it's really mysterious.  The sound is awesome on this DVD and there doesn't seem to be any articacts on the video, if only we had a DTS sound selection.	5.0	One of the Greatest Sci-Fi Flicks!!!	2001-06-15	1	0	1

This is the only Matrix movie ive seen, Ive seen the other ones only like an hour of them though. Its a good movie, especially for 10 bucks. I recommend you check this movie out. Not much action in this movie, but theres a couple scenes with some good action parts, but a good storyline, it keeps you entertained throughout the whole movie.

0790745399	The Matrix	AVQ7GNVHX9HU3	Wu Yuan	I was quite impressed by the film in the cinema. Good plot, no similar stories have never been seen. The slow motion of flying bullets is probably new. Later I bought the vcd which includes the making of the film. It was a good effort to invite Hooping as the action director. But the actors were trained for only three months which might be a little short. As a usual practice, actors and actresses who have no martial arts background ususally need 6 months' training before they can really perform in front of the camera. (5-6 months for crouching tiger hidden dragon, as an example). The fighting scene between keanu and the laurence is like kids' playing. Their movement lacks a little grace which could probably prevent it from becoming a classic. Maybe you don't agree with me now, but if you carry on to watch other movies directed by Yuan Hooping, you will realise that what I have said is not exaggerated.	4.0	Good movie though the fighting is a little naive!	2000-12-31	1	0	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A1Q15TP2FXYYMF	"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo"""	This is a great film. The films budget for this film was around $60 million and was the first film to (fully) employ 'bullet-time' effects- where computer software is able to slow down scene to the speed where moving bullets (and forces) can be seen.The plot is potentially confusing which is why the film will make much more sense when watched twice.Because of the high use of quality music (AC/DC) and awsome use of sound effects the film would be a great treat for your surround sound system- imagine a large scale gun fight between 10+ men darting along your speakers firing and shouting.At times it can seem like your just waiting for a gun fight at the 'boring bits', but they are worth the wait.The Dvd includes behind the scenes and all the standards you would expect from a DVD.This film was made with the intention of not being in a trilogy but because of its populatity Warner Brothers gave a $300 budget to making 2 further films. These films can be seen as 'The Matrix Hollywoodised' because of its overmade and used computer effects and a plot that seems to intentially confuse you by never speaking in casual tongue in the film- at times you can feel like an idiot when you don't understand the plot.In my opinion the first Matrix film is the best is has become a classic amoung action lovers.While the other 2 films were entertaining as a novilty, 'The first Matrix film is how the Matrix was before Hollywood got to it'	5.0	A Great Movie	2006-06-09	5	4	1

0790745399	The Matrix	A2BNX7D74MQTDR	Yardeezi	The movie was incredible. The plot was complete with a sappy but enchanting love story, breathtaking action and fighting sequences, and an edge-of-your-seat climax of twists that led to an orgasmic conclusion of events. The story line had seemingly endless depth that seemed simple to put together, but upon close scrutiny, was a cover for various subplots (some intentional, some are haphazardly conjured up by passionate Matrix freaks like myself). The parallels wih the story of Jesus, for example, seem irrefutable. The cast played their characters to the utmost. Even middle-aged Lawrence Fishburn's (Morpheus) karate scenes were unsettlingly believable. Keanu Reeves (Neo)demonstrated superior martial arts technique (with the help of digitization and wires of course) as well. The screenplay was absolutely riveting. The breakthrough visual effects, like Neo dodging bullets in detailed slow-motion, or the (now hackneyed) &quot;jump-and-remain-in-the-air-while-the-camera-does-a-360 degree-turn-around-the-action&quot; effect, all leave the viewer in a visual and mental bliss. In my honest opinion, the Matrix is the greatest movie of the decade...(yes, its better than that movie too...whatever it was you were thinking isn't nearly as great, trust me). It's one of those movies you watch 50 times and still be able to find some new, integral piece of the story. The best part of the movie is the fact that it is going to be a trilogy. Star Wars eat your heart out.	5.0	Paradigm for a classic film	2001-11-30	1	0	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A2QK0CLGM4Q0R3	"yarden ""yarden"""	I loved the movie, but by now you know that this movie is exciting, fast-paced, with Oscar-winning Special Effects and Sound.  I want to focus, instead on this fully-loaded DVD.The DVD was ALMOST perfect.  I was  happy with all the extras afforded on this DVD: the production notes, the  behind-the-scenes documentaries, the in-depth special effects  documentaries.  However, I was supremely disappointed with the running film  commentary.The commentary was NOT by the Wachowski brothers, but by  supporting star Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), editor Zach Staenberg, and  visual effects supervisor John Gaeta.  I would LOVE to hear what the  Wachowskis have to say about their movie, but on the Matrix DVD, it's all  hearsay as reported by the editor and visual effects supervisor.  That's at  best.  At worst, it's extended periods of silence, and an absent  commentator (Carrie-Anne Moss seems to mysteriously disappear about 1/3 of  the way through the movie).Of course, it's somewhat interesting to  hear about how these people got involved with the movie, but that's not  what I was most hoping to hear about. Perhaps when the trilogy is complete,  the Wachowskis will release a 3-film commentary.  Now that would be  good.Aside from the little problem of the non-director's commentary, I  was more than happy with the other features of the DVD, and am proud to own  this DVD.	5.0	DVD Review -- Everything great but ONE thing	2000-05-26	1	0	1

This isn't the greatest movie EVER, but it is still a good action-packed film. The DVD has a Menu where one can see the setting of the cameras, a few commentaries, an all-music commentary, and (this is creative) where one can set up a white rabbit to flash at the bottom of the screen at certain parts, leading on to show how those scenes were filmed. The plot of the movie is basically about Keanu Reeves's character (Neo) searching for an answer and finding the truth hidden in the secret world of the Matrix along with a crew of people &quot;freed&quot;, where as the crew are searching for the One. The film would have been more complete if the characters were a bit more developed and talkative instead of Laurence Fishburne doing most of it.  But don't let that discourage you, because this is a really well-played film. And yet it doesn't tear away from what the movie's theme is trying to tell you.This movie is great to own and the DVD version is best because of the extra information you can find which, for the bigger fans, is an extra bonus. In the end, the Matrix is really worthwhile.	5.0	The Matrix comes forth...	2001-11-17	2	0	2

0790745399	The Matrix	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"""Wake Up, Neo"".With those three seemingly simple words, the entire concept of the Matrix is born.  Part science fiction, part philosophical musing, part action-adventure, ""The Matrix"" is, pure and simple, the most well-crafted science fiction film of all-time.The film, set in a human future where machines control the human race and use humans much like we currently use batteries, centers on the fate of one man, Neo (Keanu Reeves), who is awakened to this terrible existence.  Much like the viewers of the film, Neo must figure out what is real and what is not, who to believe and who to fight.The real gem hidden within this film, however, is its commentary on the CURRENT human condition, or specifically how we continue to design smarter and smarter machines that may one day be our downfall.  Plus, the absolutely unbelievable/horrible future that awaits us is so unforgiving that viewers can't help but cheer for the protagonists, even if we will go back to our AI the next day at work.The acting in this movie has been much-maligned, but the characters (while truly not very emotive) are almost MEANT to have a sort of philosophical tone to them.  Neo is the confused savior, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is the unflappable leader, and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is the experienced sidekick.  Also, the villainous ""Agent Smith"" (Hugo Weaving) will make you want to see him absolutely annihilated (the sign of a truly good villain!).Of course, the special effects in this film are absolutely stunning, what with the use of ""Bullet Time"" (where the lightning action is slowed down to miniscule movements without losing any clarity).Overall, this is a masterpiece science fiction film, combining an extraordinarily engaging plot, very able-bodied protagonists and antagonists, as well as special effects that, at the time of the film's release, were cutting edge.  So, if you are looking for a film that will have you deep in contemplation days after viewing, but will also make you say ""Whoa"" (to quote Neo) while viewing, this film is for you."	5.0	The Greatest Science Fiction Movie EVER	2008-08-31	2	1	1

I would highly recommend this movie, and I am not talking about just the full trilogy. I am talking about the very first one, this one. There is alot of symbolism in this movie and certainly several aspects that would drive one mad and utter turns to disbelief if it were to be true. What if our reality is the Matrix? Don't start looking for the holes on your arms...yet.Also, there was alot of dailogues between Neo and Morpheus that is memorable, including this one:""The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. Were you listening to me, Neo? Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?""The woman in the red dress is what we would consider to be temptation.  There are those who tasted temptation, lived for it, and will die for it...even though it is a lie. Interesting, eh?Go out and see this movie. It is surely a must see and there's a good deal to learn from it. But, if you're not into symbolism of the movie, the actions and fights were ""awesome,"" as my inner child would say."	5.0	Great Movie, Alot of Symbolism	2008-04-01	5	4	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A318RKL1I9ABCM	"""zaloop"""	The greatest Hong Kong action film ever made is an American film.The Matrix had been looking like an excellent film ever since the first previews of it were shown. And thankfully, it really does live up to its looks. It meets and exceeds all high hopes and expectations awaiting it. It is a gorgeous, visionary, and revolutionary film, one of the best films of 1999, indeed one of the greatest films of all time.The thing that stands out the most in The Matrix is its awesome and well-crafted action: numerous weapons, high-tech shootouts, maneuvering and dodging unlike in any other film, reality-bending moves and motion that makes other actions films' fight scenes seem slow and weak in comparison thanks to their powered-up and enhanced environment... and hand-to-hand martial-arts combat scenes that are among the most complicated, fast, clever, original, and fun fighting scenes of action films, if not simply the best. Thanks to the premise of the film the characters can move and fight in such enhanced and extraordinary ways that it makes all other action films seem slow in comparison.The excellent and sophisticated direction keeps the action alive: beautiful stop-motion and slow-motion use combined with extremely impressive 360-degree rotating and panning of the camera; wonderful cinematography, overall, which compliments and helps the action to be as great as it is.There's another thing The Matrix does right. In almost all other martial arts films, the fighting form is ruined by its dependence on props and humor sketches. I saw Romeo Must Die recently. It had a bad plot, but that wasn't its only problem. The fight scenes lost all excitement and turned into cliche when Jet Li used things such as bag string and a water hose to fight his enemies. Other times, the entire fight would be devoted to achieving a stupid sight gag, such as the enemy thugs having their pants fall down. How cute. In other words, the fights turned into cheap Jackie Chan-style theatrics. They used everything as a weapon except actual martial arts. The Matrix does not do this. It knows not to fool around with its action. It uses pure, graceful combat. Apparently, this is a new idea. How ironic it is that an American film knows how to do martial arts better than most recent Hong Kong films.The story propelling and surrounding this action and stylish camerawork goes like this: Keanu Reeves' character, Neo, finds out that he (along with the rest of humanity) is living in a fake world in a fake 1999: the world he lives in is one huge virtual reality environment pulled down over people's eyes. This virtual world is known as The Matrix. And the real world, above them, contains the humans' rulers and enslavers- a culture of robots using The Matrix to enslave humans and drain them of energy, while they are being controlled, to fuel their machines. Only a handful of people, led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), know this truth. They search for &quot;The One&quot; who will be able to overthrow humanity's rulers- and they find him, seemingly, in Neo.So to go along with the thrills there is a quality story, too, unique and well-made. It's an intriguing premise and an interesting vision of the future. There are thought-out scientific and electronic scenarios, which let the action be crazy as it is. And through the themes on reality and its relativity, the power of belief, the concept of mind-over-body, Bible symbolism (from The One to to Nebuchadnezzar to Zion to Trinity, it's there), and even Cartesian philosophy the film presents its tantalizing message with cleverness: let your mind go. Take the pill.The acting is the sole dent (however small, as will be explained) of this otherwise wonderful film. Fishburne was very good, composed and only sometimes corny. Carrie-Anne Moss was good, too. But Keanu Reeves seemed dull, droll, and without enough emotion inside him. Sometimes he even recites his lines without any real inflection in his tone of voice, making him sound somewhat fake. But then again, this film isn't a drama, it's an action film, and any action film that tries to be a drama and tries to have its actors be dramatic is pointless. The Matrix doesn't fall into this trap and successfully negates Reeves' empty acting by having the focus on the action, not the dialogue/drama. The total 15 minutes or so of serious drama/exposition that Reeves is in doesn't, in the long run, diminish the quality of the film at all.The Matrix is near-perfect; it is one of, if not the, single most diverse and clever action films of all time; not many films reach this level of originality and vision, and when they do, like this one, they remind me why I love movies so clearly. It's one of the greatest films of all time. Even if it only had superb action and nothing else like plot or direction, it would still be great. Do yourself a favor and see it. And buy it.PS: This isn't directly related to the film, but I must say one thing I don't like about this film's popularity is how it seems to have spawned all this backlash against Star Wars: The Phantom Menace! Look, both are excellent films, leave TPM alone.	5.0	It Has You.	2000-11-05	14	12	2

0790745399	The Matrix	A25JBPU5G0C29H	Zev Bazarov	"This is a very fun film, that mends action with philosophical concepts and religious symbolism. The film is fun to watch just because it has some very cool action scenes that are pleasurable for the eyes. Yet there exists a more intellectual depth for your mind. What makes it great is that, upon viewing it multiple times, you get more out of it. You discover different themes and messages, every person gets something different out of it. There are many interpretations and views you can arrive at.The characters are great, the best being Morpheus and Agent Smith. The character of Neo as a doubting Thomas-Christ figure is played out well. And it is very pleasing to see a female action star that is not put on the screen just to showcase sexuality, but who is tough and can take care of herself.Watch for the ""Night of the Lepus"" clip, and BULLET TIME special effects (that every new movie copies). 5 Stars. Check it out."	5.0	Great film for your eyes and mind.	2002-07-12	1	1	0
0790745399	The Matrix	A1PRVXJIQYZ70C	"""zigaferd"""	"I've seen this movie countless times , around 20 or so. I know ever line and sence. If this is your first time to see it watch the special effects the first time but pay close attention the the story line or you could get lost. Don't worry the special effects are reason enough to buy this movie it does have something for ever over the age of 10 or there about.(if aloud to see R). A must buy for anyone and look for the next two ""the Matrix reloaded and Matrix revolution"" both come out in 'I think' 2003 or late 2002. GET THEM All!"	5.0	THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WHOLE WORLD!	2002-07-20	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	ALFLLAWLUFBL0	"""zinnyinca"""	This movie isn't just an action movie with REALLY cool special effects - there are some potent metaphorical messages that you can get out if it if you listen to what they're saying about perception, truth, and human  potential. However, I didn't like how the reality beyond the Matrix was so  dismal and gloomy. It sends almost a subconscious message that  &quot;ignorance is bliss,&quot; which is a dangerous idea for democracy.  Other than that, this is one of the best films in this year!	5.0	Fascinating...	1999-12-11	1	0	1
0790745399	The Matrix	A1HYTMPSOF7437	ZLeathal1	I saw this in the theatres, it was unbelievable! The story itself is a cross between the Easter Story and Alice in Wonderland. The special effects are like no other. Great movie if you like Sci-fi or just great action! It  definetly makes you think a lot after. You MUST see this movie in your  lifetime!	5.0	My personal all-time fav!!!!!	1999-10-05	0	0	0
0790745399	The Matrix	AQ942MJN03N0U	zternal	My opinion toward the special effects in this movie is definitely top notch and deserves all the technical academy awards it deserves.  And through these special effects, it has better expressed the &quot;what is  reality&quot; phenomenon that has been touch on before, but never in this  &quot;techno&quot; way.  However, I cannnot say the matrix is an original  movie due to its ideas and plot that have been explorer before.  Perhapes  revolutionary to some degree, but not original.  And where originality can  hold its own, special effects cannot.  Sooner or later, its awesome  &quot;bullet time&quot; and subtle details will give way to even better  visual and audio.If I were given 0 to 10, I would give this a 7 (where 5  is the average movie, and 10 is &quot;movie of all movies&quot;).  The DVD  in my opinion is worth getting.  The picture and sound quality are REALLY  GOOD.	4.0	The Matrix is special effect specialized and then some...	2000-06-12	3	2	1
